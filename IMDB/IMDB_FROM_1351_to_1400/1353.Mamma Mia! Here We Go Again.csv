0,TheLittleSongbird,Journey to the past,6,4 August 2018,"'Mamma Mia!' is a very marmite film, with people either loving it or hating it. To me, it was something of a mixed bag with me neither loving or hating it. It does a lot right (the production values, the music, some production numbers and most of the performances), but had some serious reservations (the script, the story, variable singing). When hearing and seeing that 'Mamma Mia!' was getting the sequel treatment, part of me was quite intrigued and the trailer looked inviting in terms of the music and production values. Also questioned the necessity of it, and did worry about how the script and story (although the concept had potential to work) would fare, a lot of the script didn't sound very promising. Seeing it, 'Mamma Mia! Here We Go Again' has a number of strengths and did entertain me (the singing is also an improvement), but again serious reservations (a few of them the same as 'Mamma Mia!' but done worse).Starting with what 'Mamma Mia! Here We Go Again' does right, it is stunning visually. It is beautifully shot and the locations are exquisite and makes one want to book a holiday there. The songs, while not fitting into the story line as well as 'Mamma Mia', are just great, with a mix of the old favourites and the lesser known songs. Very infectious and with clever potent lyrics. The standout renditions are ""Andante Andante"" (gorgeous and moving), ""Fernando"" (raises the roof and it feels like we're watching Cher performing at a concert rather than here featuring in a film) and ""My Love, My Life"" (will admit that the tears rolled, have tissues at the ready).Choreography has glitz, professionalism and energy, not feeling overblown. ""Dancing Queen"" is epic, while ""Waterloo"" hasn't lost the energy that was brought into the song in 'Mamma Mia!'. ""Fernando"" and ""My Love, My Life"" were unforgettably staged too. There is a lot of energy in the musical numbers, some charm and there are fun moments with Christine Baranski, Julie Walters and particularly Omid Djalili.Lily James shines like a true star in a truly energetic, charming and sometimes moving performance. Amanda Seyfried sings beautifully and is suitably bubbly, while Jessica Keenan Wynn is suitably spiky and Meryl Streep moved me to tears despite her screen time being short. Christine Baranski and Julie Walters have nice moments, and Omid Djalili is a scene stealer. Didn't mind Pierce Brosnan having not much to do, being one of many people who disliked him and his infamous rendition of ""S.O.S"" in 'Mamma Mia!'.He did seem tired here and Colin Firth and Stellen Skarsgaard are criminally underused. Alexa Davis overdoes it, with her emotions bordering on overwrought. While Cher brought the house down and raised the roof in ""Fernando"" elsewhere she didn't seem that engaged with a real lack of enthusiasm in her line delivery, also found her presence generally unnecessary and not adding much. The younger male cast are competent but somewhat bland.The story is even thinner than in 'Mamma Mia!' and in the non-musical number scenes the energy flags badly and come over as flat, Ol Parker's workmanlike at best and sometimes lethargic direction in these scenes don't help. The older/adult cast have far too little to do, they're basically cameos.Writing is also weak, with a lot of the jokes falling flat and much of the script is formulaic and undercooked, sometimes vulgar as well and going well overboard on the froth. There are inconsistencies galore and the dual timeline, which a nice idea, gets confusing in places.Overall, a very mixed bag. Far from terrible, a long way from great. 5.5-6/10 Bethany Cox",Mamma Mia! Here We Go Again
1,SnoopyStyle,More Mamma Mia,6,19 October 2018,"Sophie (Amanda Seyfried) is reopening the Greek island villa resort in honor of her late mother Donna (Meryl Streep). She invites her three fathers (Colin Firth, Stellan Skarsgård, Pierce Brosnan), her mother's best friends Tanya (Christine Baranski) and Rosie (Julie Walters), along with many others for the reopening. She decides not to invite her grandma (Cher). The movie also follows young Donna (Lily James) as she travels through Europe meeting her three boys and falling in love with a rundown villa on a Greek island.If you love the first movie, there is nothing not to love in this sequel. In fact, this one eliminates the bad solo guy singing and replaces them with Lily James who is an energetic eager performer with a better voice. I don't mind the Cher sections although it wants to be more epic than I can take. I don't like the artificial daylight background at the villa which accentuates a bad fake look compared to the real Greek island. There is one moment when villa falls apart during storms in both timelines. At that moment, I can see a more compelling plot device where both stories are mirror images of each other told at the same pacing with both cast doing the same songs. It doesn't mitigate the greatness of the climatic meeting in the church. I think it would actually heighten the emotional impact if Lily James meets Amanda Seyfried and then turns into Meryl Streep. The boyfriend isn't much and would be more dramatic if he goes away. As a musical, there are still a few famous ABBA songs to mine although there are others that I don't recognize. It's bright. It's chipper. It is a fitting sequel to the first movie.",Mamma Mia! Here We Go Again
2,Horst_In_Translation,Succeeds with everything that the first did not,8,22 July 2018,"""Mamma Mia! Here We Go Again"" is as the title already gives away the sequel to the 2008 Abba tribute movie ""Mamma Mia"". This new one here runs for slightly under 2 hours and it brings back most of the cast members from said original movie. And as for the latter, I must say that I am not a great fan at all to be honest. Still I read this new one got better reception and reviews and so I thought why not give it a go. After all, I really like some of ABBA's stuff. And I was very positively surprised. Like I wrote in the title, this one here does everything right in these areas where the original film comes relatively short, gently-speaking, regardless if we are talking about the comedy, the music, the story or the acting. Or the performances to be more precise. I think there were some really good ones here and the worst were perhaps on the level of the best performances 10 years ago. You could see that they were really casting with focus on music too, especially when it came to picking those who play the characters when they were young. And there I am speaking already about a major component from this movie, which is that the film in good old Godfather 2 manner is a sequel that also takes us back several decades into the past. Meryl Streep's version of Donna may be gone (really bold choice by writer and director Ol Parker), but don't think there is no Donna in here. She is inevitably linked to the franchise of course. Nonetheless, I thought overall that the ""now"" convinced me more than the past. But that is of course subjective. Lily James and the other actors from the old sequences do a fine job as well. But the biggest thumbs-up goes to Amanda Seyfried for sure. I am never too sure how much I like her, but she did really great, especially in the music sequences. Her very first song, which is also the first song of the film, was a delight already and it stayed that way every time she was about to sing. This includes the film's number 1 highlight, a duet named ""One of Us"" where ABBA is for once at their saddest, not at their fastest or most delightful like with songs such as ""Mamma Mia"" who may have a serious undertone, but still turn out full of drive and power.One thing I did not like that much, but it's really just a minor criticism, is how Dominic Cooper was left out almost entirely apart from the early phone conversation and while Firth and Skarsgård got their return story, he did not. Pity his name was not considered big enough for that. Also his sudden comeback story with all his love being there again was kinda meh given what he said during the phone call. It is what it is I guess. And then there is Cher of course, heavily featured in the trailer, but yeah, she does not do too much apart from being herself basically towards the end. But I read she has plans to release a full album with ABBA songs now after this film and I'd love to hear that. The scene with Streep at the very end was sweet nonetheless and I thought it was a nice treat for everybody who enjoyed the original movie more than I did. Shame I did not because otherwise this could have moved me to tears, that's how good it was. What else can you say. Well maybe absolutely everybody was getting their man somehow and it was a bit too much of a forced happy ending perhaps, but it's okay, somehow it fit the film's tone so it's fine. And yes I mentioned the comedy earlier already and there were some really funny moments like Skarsgård's twin brother in fat makeup telling everybody the embarrassing goat story. All in all, that's it I guess. I could write a lot more about the movie, but I just repeat myself that this was a really positive surprise and one of the best 2018 movies I've seen. We'll see if it gets some awards attention at the Golden Globes for example. It definitely should if the first did. Also it gives a really good overview of some of ABBA's very finest, so it's not too surprising to see some of the band members as producers here. I am not too sure how important it is to have seen the first to appreciate this one, maybe helps, but it's not essential you could say. So watch this one here in any case, maybe after skipping the first. But if you have seen the first and sat through that one, then really don't miss out on this one here, especially for as long as it is still in theaters because I think it is a much better watch on the big screen. Huge thumbs-up. Highly recommended.",Mamma Mia! Here We Go Again
3,Prismark10,"Money, Money, Money",4,23 April 2019,"Mamma Mia! Here We Go Again is a musical sequel that has a stretched story focusing on the young Donna and how she encountered her three men. Even though we did see those scenes in the first movie.The film starts with Sophie (Amanda Seyfried) refurbishing her Greek island Hotel. Donna has passed away. Sky is in New York learning the hotel business and things do not seem to be going well between them.For the grand opening of the hotel in honour of her mother, Sophie has invited her three dads and her mother's best friends.The main part of the story is seeing the young Donna (Lily James) travelling through Europe after graduating at university. Some of the scenes switch with that of Sophie.It required three writers to come up with the story concept. The story is admittedly thin. The new songs are ok. Cher just looks odd when she makes her belated appearance as Sophie's grandmother. She looks like someone who has just turned up for the pay cheque and decided to do an album of Abba covers out of it.The Abba songs keep it entertaining but this movie stinks of a cash grab.",Mamma Mia! Here We Go Again
4,jboothmillard,Mamma Mia! Here We Go Again,6,28 July 2018,"I debated whether I wanted to see the sequel at the cinema, but then I watched the original again and I had much more fun, and I saw film critic Mark Kermode enjoyed it, so I just went along with and hoped to have fun. Basically Sophie Sheridan (Amanda Seyfried) is preparing for the grand reopening of the hotel formerly owned by her mother Donna (Meryl Streep), who passed away a year ago (in unknown circumstances). She is sad that two of her fathers, Harry Bright (Colin Firth) and Bill Anderson (Stellan Skarsgård), are unable to make it, and she is trouble in her marriage to Sky (Dominic Cooper), who is in New York. It flashes back to 1979, to see young Donna (Lily James) graduating from Oxford, along with her friends and Dynamos bandmates Tanya (Jessica Keenan Wynn) and Rosie (Alexa Davies). Donna gets ready to travel the world, while in Paris, France, she meets and has a relationship with Harry (Hugh Skinner). She later misses her boat to Kalokairi, but sailor Bill (Josh Dylan) offers her a ride, and along the way they help a stranded fisherman make it to stop the love of his life marrying another man. Unbeknownst to Donna, Harry has followed her to Greece, but he is too late and watches as she sails off into the distance. In the present, (Tanya Christine Baranski) and Rosie (Julie Walters) arrive to support Sophie with the reopening, it is revealed that Rosie and Bill have split up. Sophie visits Sam (Pierce Brosnan), who is still grieving over the passing of Donna. Back in the past, Donna arrives on the island and explores a farmhouse, during a sudden storm, a young Sam (Jeremy Irvine) riding his motorcycle helps her to rescue a spooked horse from the house basement. Back to the present, a sudden storm has caused serious disruption to Sophie's plans for the grand reopening and prevented media coverage of the event. Back in the past, Donna and Sam are enjoying a whirlwind romance, but then Donna discovers a photograph of Sam's fiancée, she tells him to leave the island. In the present, Sam reassures Sophie the reopening will go ahead, meanwhile Harry walks out of business deal in Tokyo to support Sophie, and Bill gets his twin brother Kurt to take his place for an award acceptance. Bill and Harry meet at the docks, but there are no boats, but Bill meets Alexio (Gerard Monaco), the fisherman he helped those years ago, he secures them a boat, as well as for newly arrived Sky. In the past, a depressed Donna is heartbroken about Sam, she meets Bill again and they spend time together on his boat. While they are gone, Sam returns, after ending his engagement for Donna, he is saddened to hear that is with another man and leaves the island. Donna discovers she is pregnant, she has no idea which of her recent lovers is the father, local bar owner Sophia (Maria Vacratsis) overhears that she wishes to stay on the island, she offers to let her live in the farmhouse, Donna happily accepts, and it is there that she gives birth to Sophie. Back in the present, boats filled with guests arrive for the party, Sophie is reunited with her other two fathers and Sky, she reveals to him that she is pregnant, and feels closer to her mother, understanding what she went through. While Bill and Rosie reunite over their grief for Donna, Sophie's estranged grandmother and Donna's mother Ruby (Cher), despite having no invitation, arrives, she reveals that Sky tracked her down in New York and wants to build a relationship with Sophie. Sophie then performs a song with Tanya and Rosie in honour of her mother, after which Ruby tearfully tells her how proud she is of her. It is revealed that the manager of the hotel, Fernando Cienfuegos (Andy Garcia), is Ruby's ex-lover from years ago, the two are joyously reunited. Nine months later, Sophie has given birth to a baby boy, everyone is gathered in the chapel for the christening, the ceremony takes place with Donna's spirit watching over her daughter with pride. Finally, all the characters, in their old and young guises, gather together to sing at the Hotel Bella Donna party. Also starring Celia Imrie as Vice-Chancellor, Omid Djalili as a Greek customs officer, ABBA's Björn Ulvaeus as an Oxford professor and ABBA's Benny Andersson as ""Waterloo"" piano player. Featuring all the ABBA hits ""When I Kissed the Teacher"", ""One of Us"", ""Waterloo"", ""Why Did It Have to Be Me?"", ""I Have a Dream"", ""Kisses of Fire"", ""Andante, Andante"", ""The Name of the Game"", ""Knowing Me, Knowing You"", ""Mamma Mia"", ""Angel Eyes"", ""Dancing Queen"", ""I've Been Waiting for You"", ""Fernando"", ""My Love, My Life"" and ""Super Trouper"". As before, all the actors do their best to sing, with mixed results, Cher belting ""Fernando"" is a highlight, all the songs (with some words tweaked) fit well into the story, the choreography is okay, if the first movie was ABBA Gold, then this More ABBA Gold, featuring lesser known songs. The story structure is just like The Godfather Part II, mixing the past with the present, as before you can ignore any imperfections and go along with it, singing along with your favourites, and the ""My Love, My Life"" sequence cannot fail but have you in floods of tears, just about as enjoyable as the first movie, a fun jukebox musical romantic comedy. It was nominated the Golden Globe for Best Motion Picture - Comedy or Musical. Good!",Mamma Mia! Here We Go Again
5,Tweekums,A solid sequel to a surprise hit,8,29 March 2020,"This sequel takes place a year after the death of Donna. Her daughter Sophie plans to reopen her mother's hotel, on a Greek island, unfortunately it looks as if neither her three fathers nor her husband will be able to attend the opening party. Intertwined with scenes of her preparing for the reopening we see how her mother came to the island all those years ago... and how she encountered the three men who are Sophie's fathers. Of course at every possible opportunity the cast sing an appropriate ABBA song.If you didn't enjoy 'Mamma Mia' you certainly won't enjoy this as it is more of the same; this of course means if you did enjoy the first you are likely to enjoy this too. The story is fairly simple but it is fun; especially the flashback scenes of Donna making her way to the island and meeting the younger versions of the 'three fathers' for the first time. The songs are fun even if things are stretched a bit to justify the inclusion of some well-known songs... particularly 'Fernando'. Of course the songs are a lot of fun, even the less well-known ones. The cast does a fine job and are clearly having fun; Lily James stands out as the young Donna. The setting, with its beautiful settings and mostly fine weather, only add to the pleasure provided by the film. Overall I'd say this won't be for everybody but it is good cheesy fun if you enjoy that sort of thing... and I did, more than I expected.",Mamma Mia! Here We Go Again
6,tavm,I actually liked Mamma Mia! Here We Go Again a little better than its predecessor,8,28 July 2018,"It's now been 10 years after the movie version of the original Mamma Mia! stage musical of ABBA songs came out. I reviewed that one on this site back in January 2009 and mentioned enjoying it very much despite the shallow plot and characterizations. For some reason, when watching this sequel with my movie theatre-working friend, I felt a little differently and now feel the characterizations and the plot-which goes back and forth between the daughter Sophie reopening her mom's hotel after said parent's passing and Donna when she was just going out on her own after college graduation-was better defined and believable. Me and my friend were just enjoying not only the characters and the plot but also the ABBA songs picked for this one of which not many of the tunes were hit singles this time around. There were also a couple of nice surprises at the end, and oh, this time Pierce Brosnan only sang once solo and he's a little low-key here to a better result! Really, I had a much wonderful time with my friend watching this in a theatre so close to the screen so on that note, I highly recommend Mamma Mia! Here We Go Again.",Mamma Mia! Here We Go Again
7,studioAT,Here we go again!,6,27 December 2019,"Is it a sequel, is it a prequel? In all honesty it's a bit of both, and just as much fun as the first film.With an entertaining cast (the younger versions of whom are well cast too) and of course the legendary ABBA music, this is an entertaining film indeed.I would urge them to stop at 2 films now though.",Mamma Mia! Here We Go Again
8,bevo-13678,Meat ball,10,15 June 2020,Funny movie. I like the bit with all the singing and stuff,Mamma Mia! Here We Go Again
9,preppy-3,VERY disappointing,3,23 July 2018,"Lousy sequel to the wonderful 2008 movie. It has Sophie (Amanda Seyfried) renovating and reopening the inn her mom Donna ran. Then it flashes back to Donna as a young girl (Lily James) meeting the three men who become Sophie's father. As with the first there's plenty of great ABBA songs on the soundtrack.
This movie has a lot going for it. Great songs, big beautiful production numbers, a good cast...but it doesn't work. The death of a main character (Donna) hangs over the movie. It's dark and downright depressing. Slow-moving too and the script is full of plot holes and inconsistencies. . The wonderful singing and dancing helps to a point. Also Cher's much publicized role is little more than an extended cameo. Also Andy Garcia is on hand looking terrible. The new young cast is certainly attractive but given no time to develop their characters. Dreary, dark and depressing. Skip it.",Mamma Mia! Here We Go Again
10,CinemaSerf,"More of the same, just not quite as engaging.",6,3 January 2020,"Sadly, a poor relation to the first outing for our ABBA-esque love story. It really does miss Meryl Streep. The others from the original do try to recreate some of the joie de vivre but the flashback storylines are distracting from the overall (and I use the word loosely) narrative. The music is super for us ABBA fans, and the dénouement sees a short but classy cameo from Cher. Bound to get your toe tapping, but perhaps we don't need volume III.",Mamma Mia! Here We Go Again
11,neil-476,Different and the same,9,27 July 2018,"Sophie is masterminding a revamp of the hotel on Kalikairi, but the grand re-opening may not go as well as she hoped - she wonders how her mother coped, and so Donna's backstory unfolds for us.10 years ago I took my 81-year old mother to see the cheesy but improbably joyous Mamma Mia at the cinema - she and my father fell in love with it, and still watch it often. She is now pushing 92 but, with the help of a borrowed wheelchair, made the trip to the cinema to see the follow-up - part sequel and part prequel - and loved it.I think it's a better film than the original - it's certainly a more solid story - albeit that unexpected sheer joyfulness coupled with Meryl Streep's deeply emotional performance doesn't - can't - burst upon the audience with all the surprise of the first film.And the selections from the Abba catalogue are, of necessity, the lesser hits and the deeper cuts. This doesn't matter. They are all well tailored to the story (or, perhaps, vice versa), and I marvel again at what a deft lyricist Bjorn Ulvaeus was in his second language.Speaking of Ulvaeus, the Abba guys both cameo again, and early on. So you don't sit there waiting for them.The backstory is intercut with the present day. The ""Then"" cast are saddled with the horrible task of playing parts which have already been established in a film which features the original actors playing those parts once more. The lads are OK, but the two girls do well. Lily James as Donna doesn't play Meryl Streep, but her charm and verve mean that she commands the screen in her own right.We came out of the cinema quite pleased that the filmmakers had managed to recapture a sense of joy while doing something rather different to what we might have expected.And I shan't be spoilering the movie's big secret. You didn't hear it from me.",Mamma Mia! Here We Go Again
12,ferguson-6,a look back,6,19 July 2018,"Greetings again from the darkness. It's been 10 years since director Phyllida Lloyd presented the crowd-pleasing MAMMA MIA! movie. It was a box office hit (over $600 million worldwide) and was, for a few years, the highest grossing musical of all-time. Most importantly, it was extremely entertaining and a joyous cinematic romp for viewers. This year's sequel is directed by Ol Parker (THE BEST EXOTIC MARIGOLD HOTEL and husband to actress Thandie Newton), and though the melancholy is slathered on a bit too thick, it also fulfills its number one priority - entertaining the fans.The story begins with Sophie (Amanda Seyfried) putting the final touches on the house-turned-hotel in preparation for the upcoming Grand Opening. It's named Hotel Bella Donna in honor of Sophie's mother (Meryl Streep). What looks to be a straight-forward story surprises us with a flashback to Donna's 1979 graduation, which features not only the first song-and-dance number ""When I Kissed the Teacher"", but also the first of two ABBA cameos ... Bjorn Ulvaeus as a professor. The young Donna is played brilliantly by Lily James, and she effortlessly captures the free-spiritedness that led to the conundrum of the first movie - 3 possible dads for Sophie.Those 3 dads return not only as Pierce Brosnan (Sam), Stellan Skarsgard (Bill), and Colin Firth (Harry), but also as Jeremy Irvine (young Sam), Josh Dylan (young Bill), and Hugh Skinner (young Harry). In fact, most of the run time is dedicated to the backstory of these characters and how they first met as youngsters. Each has a segment (and song) with young Harry featured in ""Waterloo"" accompanied by Benny Andersson (ABBA cameo #2) on piano. Young Bill is the charming sailor who saves the day for Donna, while young Sam assists her with saving a storm-shaken horse (kind of humorous since Mr. Irvine starred in WAR HORSE).  Also back are Dominic Cooper as Sky, Sophie's true love, who can't decide between romance and career, and Donna's life-long friends Tanya (Christine Baranski) and Rosie (Julie Walters), who are also part of the flashback as Jessica Keenan Wynn (excellent as young Tanya) and Alexa Davies (as young Rosie). New to the cast are Celia Imrie in the graduation number, Andy Garcia as the hotel manager, and drawing the biggest applause of all ... Cher as Sophie's grandmother (and as my viewing partner commented, an early peek at what Lady Gaga will look like as a grandma)! It's best if you experience Cher for yourself, and it should be noted that this is her first big screen appearance since BURLESQUE in 2010.Of course, the songs are key and many of the ABBA numbers from the first movie are featured again this time. In particular, ""Dancing Queen"" is a nautical standout, and ""Fernando"" is a show-stopper. While it may not be quite as raucous as the first, it's a treat watching Lily James, and there is a wonderful blending of ""old"" and ""new"" in the finale. The only real question remaining is, did the casting director do the math before casting Cher (age 72) as Meryl Streep's (age 69) mother?",Mamma Mia! Here We Go Again
13,HotToastyRag,Even better than the first one!,10,21 May 2020,"Let's get the obvious out of the way: Meryl Streep is in this movie for five minutes. She may be front and center in the promotional poster, and she may get the ""and"" in the credits, but she makes her entrance during the very last scene of the movie. The premise of this prequel/sequel is that her character has died, and her daughter is struggling to run the hotel by herself. I know; no one told me that, either. This one's a drama, folks.I thought this movie was going to be terrible, a silly excuse to prance around and sing more ABBA songs, alongside a thin plot that was described in five minutes during the original and didn't need more detail. But it's so much better than the first one! Not constrained by the ill-fitting songs of the original Broadway musical that stuck numbers into scenes with no connection to furthering the story, this movie actually puts songs in when they matter. There are a few overlaps of songs that were used in the first movie, but the vast majority of the songs are new (to the movie, not to ABBA fans); and many of them have a more somber tone that fit the story. ""One of Us"" is sung by Amanda Seyfried and Dominic Cooper when they break up at the start of the movie. ""I Wonder"" (a great number that you'll only find in the deleted scenes) is sung by Lily James as she heads off to have a European adventure after graduation.The best part of the movie, and the reason it's infinitely better than the first one, is the respect the ""younger cast"" gives to the ""older cast"". While part of the plot is a sequel, five years after the first movie ended, with Amanda Seyfried planning a grand re-opening of the hotel with one of her dads, Pierce Brosnan, by her side, the main plot is a prequel, chronicling her mother's journey to Greece and her encounter with three young men. In this extensive flashback, everyone was given a younger counterpart, and everyone did extensive research. Lily James projects all of Meryl Streep's mannerisms from the first movie, Jeremy Irvine perfects Pierce Brosnan's accent, Hugh Skinner matches Colin Firth's hesitation and speech patterns, Josh Dylan is just as carefree and fun as Stellan Skarsgard, Alexa Davies puts in shoulder rolls and wacky movements to channel Julie Walters, and Jessica Keenan Wynn seems like someone put Christine Baranski in a time machine. It's wonderful to see the younger cast and the older cast in alternating scenes, and, just like the original, you can feel how much fun everyone had while filming.While it's rude to pick out one member among the cast as the highlight, Lily James is such an adorable, likable sweetheart, she deserves an extra mention. It's no small task to make everyone in the audience forget they came to the theaters to see Meryl Streep, and yet to continually remind everyone that you're playing her younger counterpart. No offense to Miss Streep, but no one will miss her in this movie. With a bright, fresh, new actress on the screen who embodies the free spirit of a time period that passed before she was born, it's just not possible to think anything's missing from the leading lady of the film. She's delightful, beautiful, sunny, frisky, and full of life. You might even puzzle as to where you've seen her before, since she's so transformed from the famed cinder girl, Churchill's secretary, and, most notably, the flapper cousin to the Granthams.There's so much attention to detail in this movie, and as someone who knows the first Mamma Mia like the back of my hand, I was able to appreciate all of it. Writer-director Ol Parker obviously loved the original and studied it, including references to every clue dropped in the script, from adding in a twin to making sure Hugh Skinner wore a Johnny Rocket t-shirt. Just don't pay attention to the order of the relationships written in the diary from the first movie. This one makes so much more sense, so just go with it. With fun, flashy colors, costumes, and on-location filming, every song and scene is enchanting.Keep in mind it's a drama. I may be an easy target, since I bawl my way through the first Mamma Mia every time Meryl Streep sings ""Slipping Through My Fingers,"" but I cried twice as hard during this movie. There are a couple of songs that connect mother and daughter, and, depending on your level of sappiness, you'll need between one and fifty Kleenexes to get through them. In my opinion, it's a great compliment to the film if the audience cries. I wouldn't have cried so much if Lily James was unlikable or if the story wasn't interesting.Trust me, even if you think it's going to be silly, you've love it far more than you thought possible. From songs that declare children the love of a parent's life, to big '70s hair, to finding home where you least expect it, to seeing everyone reunited ten years later with jokes and winks to go around, this is a movie you'll want to watch over and over again. If you thought the end credits of the first movie were fun, you'll love the credits in these, as the older and younger people dance together and savor adorable curtain calls. I know what I'm getting for Christmas-that, and a box of Kleenex.
DLM Warning: If you suffer from vertigo or dizzy spells, like my mom does, this movie might not be your friend. When Amanda Seyfried lies down on her bed during ""One of Us"" the camera spins around in a circle, and it will make you sick. There's another circle during ""Waterloo"" right after it shows the chorus woman in a wheelchair. A third spin is in the closing credits during a group shot. In other words, ""Don't Look, Mom!""",Mamma Mia! Here We Go Again
14,phd_travel,If not for Lily James this wouldn't be worth watching,4,10 August 2018,"LiIy James has so march charm and energy and she dances and sings well. She makes some of the other actors look insipid and amateurish. That was casting genius. But the younger versions of the men were badly cast except for Jeremy Irvine of War Horse who is okay. The young Bill and Harry are so creepy looking. 
Musically the familiar songs like Mama Mia and Dancing Queen are welcome rehashes. Some of the new songs are unmemorable and draggy and don't advance the plot. The filming was in Croatia and the lush vegetation and sandstone buildings look like Croatia not Greece.One of the few good points was that the story quite satisfyingly explained how she slept with the three men in pretty quick succession without being sleazy.One of the almost plus points was that Meryl wasn't in most of this movie. When she finally reappears she drags things down to a substandard level. She ruined the first movie. Cher is so much better than her.",Mamma Mia! Here We Go Again
15,DKosty123,A Haunted House Sequel of The Original,6,31 July 2018,"There are good things about this musical comedy. The locations used in Croatia look fabulous. The Graduation seen at Oxford, UK reminds me much of Professor Wagstaff's college decorum at Huxley University in HorseFeathers (for those who have never seens one of the Marx Brothers top grossing films from Paramont, it throughly lampoons higher education. That is the only reason why it doesn't get as much aclaim as Duck Soup. ) Another good thing is the crossing of 3 generations or so in the cast. The idea here is to continue the story and try to get all ages interested it it. A fair part of the cast is really quite old. 72 Year Old Cher looks very heavy both in girth and in the make up department. It is also unclear why she is even there other than to do the one song. I also wonder if CGI is used along with make-up on Cher as her neck has no wrinkles which is truly amazing.Meryl Streep at age 69 does not have as much make up and actually looks good for that age. I am glad to see the Grandparents, Parents, Kids and Grand kids all mixed together.The bad parts are the mix ups in script and the story. I came out of the film that I saw with someone and they had a different idea of what everything meant than I did. I would classify this more as a Musical than a comedy. Of course, the way they present it I think an episode of 79 year old Maury Povich needs to be done to have a DNA test sort out the fantasy from the reality (if there is any reality in this plot line). Oh well, we got 3 daddies, a plastic great Grandma, a mom who appears to be risen from the dead, and more women throwing themselves at men than the average movie. Women can throw themselves at METOO, I don't mind. I think with a few lines and zingers, we could make this a sequel to Halloween and bring in Jason as Cher's Ex-Grandpa. It is entertaining and well staged. It's just a bit out of the realm of being a musical that would bring back musicals and another summer of 2018 movie that falls short.

16,lasttimeisaw,MAMMA MIA! HERE WE GO AGAIN promises pure joy and Euro-pop feel-goodism to its core audience,6,23 July 2018,"Precisely 10 years after its massively popular antecedent, this ABBA-jukebox musical sequel/prequel returns with a somber premise, our beloved protagonist Donna Sheridan (Streep) has kicked the bucket (does the film even reveal the cause of death?), and passes the baton to her daughter Sophie (Seyfried, thankfully bestowed with an ethereal voice), who is still processing her grief and the sequel-story kick-starts in the same Greek island of Kalokairi, where Sophie has a forthcoming reopening of Hotel Bella Donna to commemorate her mother with the help of the hotel manager Fernando (García).Meantime, the film's prequel-narrative is rewound to 1979, recounting a young Donna (James, spirited and ebulliently fleshes out the Streep-less narrative arc with her stentorian singing bent), freshly out of college, how she winds up on the island and gets knocked up but cannot tell whose fortuitous sperm strikes gold, and decides to raise her child all on her own. So apart from the old gang, even Streep has a glorified cameo near the end as a ghost reunited with Sophie during her baby granddaughter's christening ceremony, the cast is redoubled not just by the initiation of the younger-self cohort, Jessica Keenan Wynn and Alexa Davies evoke uncanny resemblances and share extraordinary exuberance with Christine Baranski and Julie Walters as Donna's bestie Tanya and Rosie, then and now, respectively, but also by the much-hyped advent of Cher, Streep's SILKWOOD (1983) co-star, who perversely plays Donna's mother Ruby in another glorified cameo, and struts her pristine skin condition and minimal movement when belts out FERNANDO, opposite to a seemingly unnerved Garciá.Never trying to overreach it from its self-knowledge of a escapist potboiler, basks in photogenic landscape or seascape and its catchy tunage, MAMMA MIA! HERE WE GO AGAIN promises pure joy and Euro-pop feel-goodism to its core audience and writer-director Ol Parker attests to be an able hand in coordinating and segueing between two story-lines, together with a faculty for choreographic deployment. As much as the cast enjoys a helluva shindig and disseminates an infectious jag of joviality to ascertain audience are having a good time either, a takeaway afterthought pops up unexpectedly by positing a morbid if entirely irrelevant presumption, how can we adjust ourselves when one day we will truly lose our national treasure like Meryl Streep and her ilks? Such a dreadful thought, perhaps, seeing things through blue-colored glasses is this reviewer's kryptonite.",Mamma Mia! Here We Go Again
17,Hellmant,"I could care less about any of the characters in either film, or any of their drama, but I love ABBA though!",5,27 July 2018,"'MAMA MIA! HERE WE GO AGAIN': Two and a Half Stars (Out of Five)A sequel/prequel to the hit 2008 jukebox musical comedy (based on the 1999 musical of the same name). The film is once again filled with music by the band ABBA, and it was written and directed (this time) by Ol Parker. It tells the story of how Sophie's mother became pregnant with her, while Sophie is now dealing with pregnancy herself. The movie stars Lily James, Amanda Seyfried, Jeremy Irvine, Hugh Skinner, Josh Dylan, Jessica Keenan Wynn, Alexa Davies, Pierce Brosnan, Colin Firth, Stellan Skarsgard, Christine Baranski, Julie Walters, Dominic Cooper, Andy Garcia, Cher and Merly Streep (in a brief cameo). It's received mostly positive reviews from critics (unlike it's predecessor), and it's another big hit at the Box Office as well (much like the original). I liked it just about as much as I did the first film, which isn't much. The story takes place five years after the events of the original, and Sophie (Seyfried) is now pregnant herself. While dealing with this news, she reminisces about the life of her (now) deceased mother, Donna (Streep); when Donna was younger (James) and became pregnant with her. The film explains how Donna met Sophie's three possible dads (Irvine, Skinner and Dylan), and the romances that developed with each of them. The entire thing is of course played out (once again) while characters are singing and dancing to ABBA tunes. I like the band ABBA (I have their 'Best Of'' CD), and I do like the music in both films. I also like musicals, sometimes a lot. These films are just so cheesy and cliched though. They're totally uninvolving as well; I could care less about any of the characters in either film, or any of their drama. The music is of course fun to hear though. Fans of ABBA, and musicals, will probably find it enjoyable enough (especially if you like the first film).",Mamma Mia! Here We Go Again
18,Lejink,Abba 'nother one,5,6 August 2018,"Okay so this one I took for the team, accompanying my wife to this second film featuring the music of one of her favourite groups. My opinion of Abba's music is that when they're good they're very good but when they're bad they're dire. Obviously the first movie, based on the stage show, employed all the mostly very good ""Abba Gold"" greatest hits while here there are quite a lot of second division tunes only their most devoted fans will know. ""Kisses Of Fire"", ""Andante Andante"", ""When I Kissed The Teacher"" anyone?The producers seem to acknowledge this weakness by repeating some of their biggest hits which had obviously already been in the first movie such as ""Waterloo"", ""Knowing Me Knowing You"", the inevitable ""Dancing Queen"" and snippets of many others too. The storyline is as flimsy as before and really just a contrivance to get all the original characters reunited in front of the cameras in bright outdoor settings. A few new characters do show up most notably Cher who delivers a surprisingly good version of both ""Fernando"" and ""Super Trouper "" to give the film a lift at the end.There are some neat and inventive camera tricks which help the flow of the film whilst the humour is as girlie and occasionally risque as you'd expect - clearly the film makers know their audience.Anyway it's all very bright , tuneful, happy and entertaining in a lightweight sentimental way, as you'd expect and my wife, well she absolutely loved it.",Mamma Mia!

19,MOscarbradley,Terrbile movie it may be but this is glorious fun.,8,14 January 2019,"Like the first one it is, of course, critic-proof, (Meryl knew that when she agreed to put in a cameo appearance and Cher knew it when she saw a chance to resurrect her career at the age of seventy-two). There are times when it resembles nothing more than gay night at the pantomime, (and if you thought the first one was gay wait until you see this one), but it would be churlish to try to resist it and, to be fair, this is by far the better movie. We are talking, of course, about ""Mamma Mia; Here We Go Again"", the sequel/prequel to the film version of the stage show that has been playing somewhere in the world for what seems an eternity.The first film worked because the Abba songs were/are basically indestructible and I did think it quite clever how they were able to construct a story around them. It was a terrible movie but it was also undeniably good fun and there were even a couple of times when it didn't seem so terrible at all. I enjoyed it while recognizing every one of its faults but I dreaded this follow-up. Surely all the best songs had already been used up, I thought. Isn't this just cashing in on the success of the original?Well, yes and no. It was obvious to anyone with a brain that they were on to a good thing so why not come up with another 'story', however flimsy. The plot is simply how did Donna meet the men in her life and how come she couldn't be sure first time around who the father of her child was. It isn't much of an idea to hang a whole movie on so let's have her daughter Sophia plan a big reopening of Donna's hotel, (Donna/Meryl has been dead a year when the film opens), bringing together the cast of the original, (as I said Meryl's appearance is reduced to a good-natured cameo), while cross-cutting between past and present.In the flashbacks, Donna is Lily James while Stellan Skarsgard and Pierce Brosnan are now hunky Josh Dylan and Jeremy Irvine. Unfortunately, poor Colin Firth is reduced to a very nerdy and obviously gay Hugh Skinner who seems to have mastered the art of playing fools. No matter, he's still the first to bed Miss James, losing his virginity in the process. So far, so obvious but this time around the musical numbers are much better served by the material and are actually very well staged while the performances are, in every way, stronger. As I said, by the time 'Dancing Queen' comes around resistance is futile and the movie becomes an elaborate party, the kind you always hoped you'd be invited to. Of course, neither film will ever be on anyone's list of all-time great musicals but even if you hate yourself in the morning, this is one party worth having a hangover for.",Mamma Mia!

There's just something special about a group of actors, not normally seen in these cheesy films, having the time of their life singing incredibly catchy pop songs and dancing their butts off. This film is a sort of sequel and prequel combined (i'm not kidding when I say the producers were inspired by The Godfather Part 2) and it has a massive cast, but most notably Lily James as a young Meryl Streep. Continuing as one of the most likable young actresses working today, James doesn't try to do a Meryl impression but certainly possesses the charisma that a young Streep did, all the while filling out the gaps of this characters past. The songs are great, the performances are mostly serviceable, the direction is always engaging, and the script is the good kind of cheesy. Oh, and the Dancing Queen sequence? Yeah, it's one of the best scenes of year in film. Yes, I just said that.8.2/10",Mamma Mia! Here We Go Again

Oh, she does have her fiance, Sky (Dominic Cooper) but, currently, he is in the NYC, interviewing for a job that may take him away from Greece. Besides this, Sophie has worked hard to re-open her mother's hotel-with-eatery and she is in a mild state of frenzy for 2nd father Bill (Stellan Skarsgaard) is getting an award in Sweden and 3rd papa Harry (Colin Firth) is negotiating a big business deal in Japan. As Sophie ponders her future with unease, the movie flashes back to a young Donna (Lily James) and her raucous college graduation. Her own mother, a mildly famous singer (later Cher), doesn't even make it. Therefore, Donna hatches a plan to travel willy nilly around the globe, where she meets a trio of eligible men on the way to a small, half-forgotten Greek island. Harry wins her heart, temporarily, by giving a rousing rendition of ABBA's Waterloo. Likewise, Bill is there to take her on his boat when she misses the ferry. Lastly, Sam rushes to help her calm a spooked horse. At every turn, romance finds young Donna but Sam seems to be THE ONE before a secret is uncovered! This action is interspersed with scenes from the present, where Donna's longtime friends (Christine Baranski and Julie Walters) arrive to help Sophie with the opening of the hotel. They are both struck with Sophie's manager, Fernando (Andy Garcia) although he confesses he gave up love long ago from a broken heart.

Will Sophie's new venture be successful amid memories of her mother's grit and liveliness? Hear, hear, fans of ABBA and the original film. The joy and wonderful music just goes on and on. Waterloo is a smash among other dazzling ABBA hits aided by superb staging. The cast is a dream, where those who reprise their roles continue the delight while the new faces, especially James, charm us, too.

24,tabuno,Entertaining and decently performed but unable able to recapture the magic,7,28 January 2019,"There was little possibility that the sequel to Mamma Mia! (2008) that primarily featured Meryl Streep in the lead role would have much of a chance to replicate the original power and display of awesome uplifting musical connection to the audience. Additionally, the complicated and somewhat tortured script and spoiler alert the absence of Donna, played by Meryl Streep, for most of the movie almost guaranteed that the sequel would fail to come close to its original musical hit that was nominated for best Golden Globe comedy or musical and actress in the same. Some of the sequel's musical pieces were not as well known and didn't resonate as with as crowd-pleasing recognition as the original. And the darker, more cerebral elements of the sequel's script also turned the sequel into a more difficult fusion of drama, sadness that resulted in losing some of the eagerly awaited gaiety and comedy found in the original. In some ways, this movie added elements found in the more serious romance of the classic West Side Story (1961). Unlike La La Land (2016) the sequel was unable to hold together the more substantive depth of the singular serious drama of La La Land with the more light-hearted elements found in the intergenerational adventures of Divine Secrets of the Ya-Ya Sisterhood (2002).The sequel is to be commended for its challenging attempts at innovative musical photography and choreography that builds on similar elements of the brilliant movie adaptation of musical remake of the stage production of Chicago (2002) and the many television musical series of the past decade. Across the Universe (2007) comes closest to being able to truly bring a creative shine to musical film-making. Personally, without the live use of singing as exclusively focused in the epic musical Les Miserable (2012), the more serious scenes of the sequel seemed more of a parody of a musical video instead with lower theatrical standards. Overall, this movie's challenging compositions and intertwining elements of past and present were truly almost insurmountable obstacles that the sequel made sincere and commendable efforts to address. Entertaining and decently performed in what one might consider a truly daunting and one of the most difficult of musicals to produce and film.",Mamma Mia! Here We Go Again
25,paulclaassen,Unoriginal and bland with terrible singing.,3,14 February 2019,"Yup, and here we go again. They really meant to cram in as many ABBA songs as possible, didn't they? Although the music is awesome, the singing was absolutely TERRIBLE. Unlike the first film where the music followed the story, here they tried to build a story around the music. The result is way too much music with a very thin plot and incredibly shallow characters. The music felt forced into the film.The magic from the original is gone. Meryl Streep's absence was also a huge drawback. I didn't find Amanda Seyfried strong enough to carry this film. Lily James wasn't bad as young Donna, but I felt they still could have used Meryl Streep. The humor resorted to slapstick as opposed to the naturally funny humor in the first film. The musical scenes were cliched and unoriginal. The film is essentially two stories rolled into one, but sadly none of these two stories are even remotely captivating. In fact, it was more annoying than interesting.The cinematography was very good with great landscapes, but the obvious blue screen scenes ruined everything, as it made it look like a theater production. Cher had the potential to save the film with her incredible voice, charm and superb acting - just a pity she was only in the film's final few minutes.

26,cruise01,Here we go again and it is worth it.,8,23 July 2018,"Mamma Mia: Here We Go Again (4 out of 5 stars).Mamma Mia is a fun, visceral fest sequel with amazing musical ques, an emotional story, and a great cast ensemble. It is also an improvement over the predecessor that came out back in 2008. For such a long gap between sequels, it was risky for sequels to top the other movie. But this sequel works and improves to be better and fun and the story does not feel like it was forced.The plot follows years after the first movie. Sophie (Amanda Seyfried) is reopening the villa hotel on a Greek island. Taking over the hotel from her mother Donna (Meryl Streep). Meanwhile, as Sophie is prepping for the reopening party. Her and her husband Sky (Dominic Cooper) have been struggling with their marriage and their conflict on relocating there lives for work. While Donna's friends Tanya (Christine Baranski) and Rosie (Julie Walters) are coming to help Sophie. All three of Sophie's fathers are coming along Sam (Pierce Brosnan), Harry (Colin Firth), and Bill (Stellan Skarsgard). The film does reflect back in the 1970s when young Donna (Lily James) is graduating from college with a mother that is nowhere to be seen. She decides to go on an adventure on traveling around. Were she meets young Harry (Hugh Skinner) who is awkward and never experienced being with a girl before. She also runs into a young Bill (Josh Dylan) who gives her a boat ride to an island. And from there she meets a young Sam (Jeremy Irvine) which she falls in love with.The plot was good and emotional one when it reflects on a young Donna's journey. It is a story about pain, love, and loss. And basically cherishing memories that defined a person. It was never slow or boring. When it flashback to young Donna, seeing her going on an adventure. Living in a broken down farmhouse on the island. Trying to start a new life there. While Sophie is trying to reorganize the new hotel.The cast was great. Amanda Seyfriend, Pierce Brosnan, Colin Firth, Stellan Skarsgard, Julie Walters, Christine Baranski, Dominic Cooper, and Meryl Streep all return and had a great musical sequence. Some new and old songs from ABBA brought to the screen. Newcomers like Lily James does steal the spotlight. She is beautiful, spontaneous, and looks at life in a positive perspective. Sadly, Meryl Streep performance is brief in this film. And same with Cher, who shows up in the final 15 minutes of the film. With her musical set piece of the Alejandro song.The film has a lot of great musical sequences that are exciting and entertaining with memorable songs. The choreography on the musical set pieces are creative, flashy, and stylish.

28,leonblackwood,Not my cup of tea but I'm sure the ABBA fans will enjoy it. 2/10,2,1 January 2019,"Review:
Now, I know that a lot of people are going to disagree with this movie review, but I can only be honest about my feeling towards this film. I'm not one for musicals, but I thought that I would give this sequel a chance, as there were some good moments in the first movie. With Meryl Streep out of the equation, I didn't have high hopes for this movie but once I heard that the rest of the cast was returning, along with Cher, I really thought that the director could pull it off. Personally, I couldn't stand the annoying singing throughout the film, which came with extremely jolly dancing scenes, and the storyline didn't help matters. I missed the funny jokes between the 3 dads, which made the first movie watchable, and the back and forth in time was a good idea, but badly executed. With that aside, it was one of the biggest movies in the UK in 2018 but I personally couldn't wait for it to end. Anyway, following the death of her mother a year earlier, Sophie Sheridan (Amanda Seyfried) is preparing for the grand opening of her mother, Donna (Meryl Streep) hotel. The movie then goes back in time to show a younger Donna in 1979, graduating from Oxford's New College with her close friends Rosie (Julie Walters) and Tanya (Christine Baranski). Donna then heads off to travel the world by herself, and she first stops in Paris, were she parties with a younger Harry (Hugh Skinner/Colin Firth). They spend the night together, but Donna leaves to catch her boat to Kalokairi, which she misses. Donna is then offered a ride from Bill (Josh Dylan/Stellan Skarsgard), not knowing that Harry was following behind her, but he sadly arrives too late and he watches the boat sailing off in the distance. It then switches back to the present day, were Rosie and Tanya join Sophie to support her during her hotel launch. Whilst preparing for the opening, a huge storm causes serious disruption to Sophie's plans and prevents media coverage of the event. Meanwhile, in their past, Donna arrives on the island and while exploring the farmhouse, a sudden storm causes her to discover a spooked horse in the basement. She goes in search of help only to find a young Sam (Jeremy Irvine/Pierce Brosnan) who helps her to save the horse. After spending time together, Donna discovers a picture of Sam's fiancée in his drawer, so she demands for him to leave the island and refuses to see him again. In the present, Sam explains to Sophie how much Donna meant to him, and how his decisions in the past still haunts him. Meanwhile, Harry and Bill decide to help Sophie with her launch, so they abandon there busy life's and they make there way to the island. They are told that there are no boats going to the island, but when Harry bumps into his old friend Alexio, he invites him and his friends to the launch, if they can take them to the island. Sophie's boyfriend, Sky (Dominic Cooper) also joins them on their mission to get to the grand opening, even though Sophie thinks that the whole event will be a disaster. Meanwhile, in the past, Donna discovers she is pregnant but has no idea which one of her three recent lovers is the father. The hotel owner, Sofia, overhears Donna's wish to stay on the island, and she happily accepts Sofia's offer to live in her farmhouse, where she eventually gives birth to Sophie. Back in the present, the guests have finally arrived at the grand opening, and Sophie is reunited with her two fathers and Sky. Sophie tells Sky that she is pregnant and has never felt closer to her mother, having now understood what she had gone through to have her. Sophie's estranged grandmother Ruby (Cher), arrives via helicopter, even though she didn't invite her. She reveals that Sky had tracked her down in New York and she wants to build a relationship with her, even though she hasn't been around for most of her life. Soon after that, it is revealed that the hotel manager Fernando (Andy Garcia) is Ruby's former lover from 1959 in Mexico, and the two are joyously reunited. After the birth of Sophie's son, named Donny, everybody burst into song, which includes the younger and older version of the characters. This is definitely a chick flick, which becomes more tedious as the movie goes along. I did find the scene where Meryl Streep is singing to her daughter, quite touching but apart from that, I lost interest near the beginning of the film. Pierce Brosnan's singing was really awful, and I wasn't that impressed with the dancing but that's not to say that people won't enjoy it. If your into ABBA songs, which I'm not, and are into people bursting into song every 5 minutes, which I'm not, then this movie is for you but I definitely won't be watching it a second time. On the plus side, the cinematography was great and I enjoyed the chemistry between the cast from the first movie but it just wasn't for me. Disappointing!Round-Up:
This movie was written and directed by OI Parker, who also brought you Imagine Me & You in 2005 and Now Is Good in 2012. He also wrote The Best Exotic Marigold Hotel and The Second Best Exotic Marigold Hotel, so he's not new to movies in this genre. It's a shame that the original director didn't return for the sequel because I much preferred her mixture of drama/comedy style, which worked so well in the first film. Anyway, for the budget, the director did well to get such a big cast, including Cher who must have cost half the budget, and the various location and huge dance numbers must have cost a pretty penny. Although this didn't tickle my fancy, I can see why people would be singing along through the dance numbers, whilst getting emotional during the dramatic scenes but I struggled to stay awake.Budget: $75million

She meets up with 3 different men all who turn out to be Pierce Brosnan,Stellan Skargard and Colin Firth later on in the film and one of them broke her heart later on in the film.

So what did I think of this one well myself and mom had a blast watching it today. It was funny,the songs were great(Pierce Brosnan with his singing was meh the,but I knew Lily could sing since she sung a song in Kenneth Branagh's Cinderella)and the story was good. My main issue though was about Meryll Streep. Now this maybe a spoiler but what did happen to her,how did she die and when it went to the flashbacks I was like am I watching 2 different movies here . The movie was set 10 years after the first movie and Streep wasn't showing any signs of dying in that film.Overall despite all this I liked it.8/10",Mamma Mia! Here We Go Again

I thought it was jumpy and choppy and the movie could have worked without the numbers, which felt inserted, altogether which is why it's aware it's a musical.It's funny, I'll give it that but for a guy not into musicals, like myself, and not into ABBA as much as I thought.

The movie is told in two parts; the present and in flashbacks and the story goes back and forth, between the two. In the flashbacks we learn how Donna-Meryl Streep's character from the first movie-met the three suitors that became the three dads to Amanda. Lily plays the young Donna in the flashbacks. In the present, Andy is the manager of the hotel Amanda is trying to get up and running and Cher plays Amanda's grandmother-Donna's mother-who doesn't show up until near the end of the movie but she does make an entrance and she does get her chance to sing. There is a big musical number involving the whole cast just as the end credits start and if you stick around until after the end credits, you will catch another scene.
It's rated ""PG-13"" for suggestive material-sex is talked about and implied but no nudity-and has a running time of 1 hour & 54 minutes.
I guess it depends on how you feel about musicals-I'm not a big fan but I do like some of them-but this one is very upbeat and enjoyable. I don't know if I would buy it on DVD but it would be a good rental.",Mamma Mia! Here We Go Again

For those too young to have any first-hand knowledge of the World's Dark Disco Days, watching pretty much EVERY Hollywood Geezer and Geriatric Gal (except maybe ""Kirk Douglas"" and ""Olivia de Havilland"") gyrating and twerking (when not making out) will be enough to give anyone born since 1980 a severe case of The Willies. Trying to figure out what's the feminine term for ""polygamy,"" what's simple incest, and what's simply gag-a-gopher gross may divert viewers possessing strong stomachs enough for them to stick out this entire horror show.

36,davispittman,Even better than the first!,10,20 July 2018,"Mamma Mia! Here We Go Again (2018) is just a great film, plain and simple. If you liked the first film, then you're guaranteed to absolutely love this sequel/prequel. It stars Amanda Seyfried, who returns as Sophie, Lily James as young Donna, Christine Baranski as Tanya, Julie Waters as Rosie, Colin Firth as Harry, Pierce Brosnan as Sam, Stellan Skarsgard as Bill, Andy Garcia as Fernando, Dominic Cooper as Skye, Jeremy Irvine as young Sam, Alexa Davies as young Rosie, Jessica Keenan Wynn as young Tanya, Hugh Skinner as young Harry, Josh Dylan as young Bill, Meryl Streep ad Donna, and finally... the lengendary Cher as Ruby! One very talented cast! I thought everyone was cast wonderfully and played their roles very well. Of the new cast members, I especially loved Cher, Lily James, and Josh Dylan. The writing is witty and clever, much like the first. And I think I liked the songs and musical numbers even better this time around. Ofcourse the first Mamma Mia really delivered on that, but something just clicked better this time. I think it's the addition of the new cast members, when you combine all that talent together it just works. The young Donna flashback part of the film is all done well, mainly thanks to Lily James.

Yet, Hollywood just loves a good run at recreating the world in their high stakes glory, leading to some renditions that are fantastic and others not so much. So, a sequel to an already obscure Mamma Mia, glorifying the incredible group Abba, seems like a bit of a stretch for a blockbuster movie. Oh well, Here We Go Again as yours truly does his second movie review of the week on: Movie: Mamma Mia: Here We Go Again (2018)Director:
 Ol Parker
Writers:
 Ol Parker (screenplay by), Richard Curtis (story by) 
Stars:
 Lily James, Amanda Seyfried, Meryl Streep 
LIKES: Toe Tapping Numbers: For a musical you need, well you need music, and fortunately the film is loaded with a number of tracks to leave you dancing in your seat. From upbeat, dance filled sequences to the more emotional, slower tracks there is a tempo for everyone in this film. As the tracks play, the choreography is just as vibrant, packed with a fun energy that fits the tracks well, and brings you into the party. If you liked the performances in the first movie than you are in luck my friends for this one. Cute: The movie may not be a big animated smash hit, or something crafted by Disney, but that doesn't mean it isn't cute all the same. Mamma Mia 2 is super friendly to many ages, and brings an easy tale of love and friendship all wrapped in a sunny bright wrapping paper. Those fans who are really looking for an easy to handle movie where nothing intense happens are again the target demographic for this one. Surprisingly Emotional: If you're this far in the review, you surely know that this movie is a fun ride, but there is a little more emotion to the film than I expected. As the tale goes, there are more than a number of fun avenues and soap opera theatrics to catch your attention. However, the movie manages to strike into deeper waters, resulting in some performances that had my audience tearing up/sniffing. The fact the film did this emotional part well surprised me despite how extreme the film is, but trust me in saying that these moments are not quite as grandiose as they could have been. Two Stories Are Integrated: You saw form the trailers that there were going to be two stories to balance. Surprisingly, they did this, though not in a traditional sense for me. Mamma Mia 2 gives you about fifty percent in each story department, helping give each set of characters ample time to explore the uncharted waters of Donna's adventurous life. They manage to cover all their promised avenues and still keep the music infused into each aspect, thereby expanding the range of performances. Lily James: I'm a huge fan of this star, not only due to her charming beauty, but her talent of bringing characters to life. Once again I was super impressed with her acting, happy to see her take classic Donna and put a more youthful energy to the mix. Her fellow divas captured their characters to the T, and the young squad really was my favorite part of the movie as they were the more interesting, and utilized. Ms. James did a fantastic job carrying the weight of the movie, and I only hope for more leading roles for her to wow me in. 
DISLIKES: Not Every Character Utilized Well: It's a large cast, we know people are going to be short sighted, but sometimes it's a little too much. Much of the cast has really fallen back to the wings with only a few having adequate time to hold up the movie. So much potential to relive the fun of the first movie gone because of too many cooks in the kitchen. As for some of the more publicized names, they don't have quite the involvement you wanted, while others get a little more billing than you might expect. The Story: The story is cute and gives you all the pertinent information, but it doesn't present it in the best light for me. There are gaps in the plots, skipped over to allow you to fill in the details. Relationships develop quickly, the pace rushed and glossed over so that more songs could be jammed in. It's a complete, yet incomplete set of stories, with sloppy transition between the two (at parts at least), with the random transitions jumping wildly with little organization at times. True, they did time some transitions perfectly, but for the most part not the best organization. False Advertising: The movie does deliver its promise on the fun, but some of the plot elements are very minor despite them being central in the trailers. In fact, these plot elements feel rather limited and underdeveloped, so can't state I was the most impressed with these parts. Too Many Songs: The killing blow for a story of a musical is when the songs become the primary focus. Mamma Mia 2 really tried to pack as many numbers into the 2-hour running time as possible, sometime without regard to if the song was appropriately fitting in the story. As a result, the story components suffered, the characters got catalogued into singing (or autotuned ability), giving it an erratic presentation that only semi impressed me. If you are just looking for musical numbers, your wish is granted, but for guys like me, I missed the complete picture. The VERDICT:  Mamma Mia 2 has expanded its emotional diving compared to the first, but manages to maintain the fun energy, charming cuteness, and beauty that was the first movie. The song and dance numbers are the central focus, so those that love this glorification of Abba's hits will be buying a ticket to musical gold. However, the components I miss is the integration of all the characters into the mix and the linear story to tie everything together. The sequel gets points for balancing two stories, but needs to work on directing better transitions and details than what it did. Still, this is definitely the upbeat movie of the month, and once I'm sure will please many audiences. Recommended theater goers should be the midlife to elderly, girls trip out, and of course the musical lovers. Otherwise just skip and wait for something bigger to come. My scores: Comedy/Musical: 7.5

43,rannynm,"Beautiful Setting, Hilarious Storyline, Great Music",10,28 July 2018,"This film has many beautiful settings and hilarious scenes that had the audience laughing. I love the unique story line that is unpredictable and interesting. Although I enjoyed it, younger children might not understand some of the jokes. This film is for more mature audiences.We learn more about Donna's (Meryl Streep, Lily James). We learn about Sophie's (Amanda Seyfried) three possible dads and what risks Donna took for Sophie. Sophie now is pregnant and finishing up her mother's dream of fixing up the property to become a beautiful hotel.Lily James has to do a lot of difficult acting in this film and she pulls through. She fits the personality of the younger Donna perfectly, which is great because it makes it easier to see the connection between younger and present day Donna. All the actors have amazing singing voices, whether they are singing solos or blending their voices with the others. They break out in song often and I wasn't bothered about that at all. They are all great dancers and seem to really just have fun.The sets are so pleasing to the eye. The setting on a Greek island with gorgeous views are amazing. All of the cities look authentic and colorful, which makes everything even more pleasing to watch. The costumes are colorful and flashy as well. My favorite part of the film is when two of Sophie's three possible fathers attend her party and they bring many guests. Sophie is so happy to see her fathers in that scene and to have everyone see how much hard work had been done to renovate the property. I also like this scene because, on the boats people, are climbing everywhere, dancing and singing together. This scene is really hyped up and has so much energy.One message of this film is that family should always love you and be there for one another, no matter what. In this film, Sophie's three dads all stick with her and support her, even though they are very busy. They never abandon her or her mother.This is definitely an unpredictable and interesting film. To better understand it, it would be best to watch the previous one, Mamma Mia. I give this film 5 out of 5 stars and recommend it for ages 13 to 18, as well as adults.Reviewed by Jolleen M., KIDS FIRST! Film Critic.

44,vengeance20,The 10 Year Wait Was Well Worth It!,9,20 July 2018,"This film was flat out amazing! Never been a fan of musicals, but since seeing the 2008 original when I was a teenager, this film was a pleasant surprise! Most of the cast have returned (I mean most because Meryl Streep's character wasn't in this), but hey most of the cast returned for this great sequel!The prequel feel to this explaining Donna life when she was in her youth was interesting! Lily James who was in Edgar Wright's Baby Driver last year was gorgeous as hell in this film! And also a great character with a angel like voice!The only bad thing in this film was the above, the death of Donna in the present, which seemed random & a last minute re-write for the film. It was disappointing but that didn't kill off the enjoyment I had for this film!Overall, 9/10, not as good as the 2008 original, but a pretty good follow-up 10 Years On!",Mamma Mia! Here We Go Again
45,wisewebwoman,Anachronisms and lack of continuity abound.,3,18 October 2020,"So much so that it distracts from the follow up on the huge hit, Mama Mia.Plus lack of plot.One standout was the number ""Waterloo"" incredible dancing and one of the Abba team on piano in a tiny cameo.It was jarring to see the disconnect from the first film, so many levels of continuity dismissed and cordless mikes and smartphones on display added to the time confusion and the supposed ages of all concerned.A shame. it really took away the joy of the first and make it all rather dismal.3/10",Mamma Mia!

46,kz917-1,But should we have gone again?,4,5 December 2018,I would wager no. There should have been no sequel without Meryl Streep.Mostly the same songs being sung by different characters.Some of the new plot points come completely out of left field and were not at all in line with the characters collective pasts.Enjoyable for the Abba music - but not much else.,Mamma Mia! Here We Go Again
47,rockman182,Mamma Mia! Here We Go Again (2018),6,20 July 2018,"Who doesn't love a good ABBA tune? I'm a pretty big fan of their music, ABBA were responsible for some absolutely timeless boppers. I did like the first Mamma Mia! film as well. Its nothing spectacular but the ABBA catalog and the cast keep the film rolling. I liked the idea of a sequel a decade letter as soon as I heard ""Dancing Queen"" in the trailer. The sequel, is not as good and probably does not need to exist but you'll be darned if you don't tap your feet and sing along.The film has two timelines. In the present day Sophie Sheridan is planning a grand opening of her mother's villa. She is pregnant and is looking towards the future to celebrate with family and friends. The other timeline is where we see a young Donna and how she meets the three men that she has had relations with in the first film. There are parallels between the events of the present and past as made very evident in the events of the film. Pretty much everyone returns with the addition of a very game Lily James and Cher.The film has gorgeous location settings and is as eye popping as ever. Its fun at most times though never feels like it takes the next step. I loved the addition of Lily James. First of all, she is absolutely gorgeous. Second, she really embodies the role and brings a spark of energy and sound that the film needed. I liked the past timeline way more than the present. There's a strong lack of good story and writing. Events are just put together for the sake of using an ABBA song. Same with the Meryl Streep inclusion, it just feels lazily put together for it to be there.Every song cover doesn't work, some are better than others. I enjoyed most of the covers and performances. I love a lot of ABBA's, work so being able to see a different rendition of it is fun to watch. As mentioned earlier some songs seem like they are put in for the sake of it and the story seems weak in that regard. Its not as good as the first, but hey you get to hear some bomb ass music, even if some of the passages (especially near the end) border on cringe. Now, lets get Lily James in absolutely everything, please.6.5/10",Mamma Mia! Here We Go Again
48,Anurag-Shetty,An absolutely delightful experience.,8,6 August 2018,"Mamma Mia! Here We Go Again continues the story, 5 years after the events of Mamma Mia!(2008). Sophie(Amanda Seyfried) learns more about her mother's past, while also dealing with her life on the exotic Greek island. Mamma Mia! Here We Go Again is a foot-tapping, energizing & super fun film. Director Ol Parker successfully takes over directorial duties from Mamma Mia!(2008) director, Phyllida Lloyd. First of all, if you're an ABBA fan(like I am) then you will definitely enjoy this movie. Most of ABBA's awesome songs are included in this film, sung really well by the cast. The locales are otherworldly. Amanda Seyfried is brilliant as Sophie. Lily James is spectacular as Young Donna. For me James' effortless performance as the younger version of Meryl Streep's character, is a strong-point of the movie. Pierce Brosnan, Colin Firth & Stellan Skarsgard are outstanding as Sam, Harry & Bill, respectively. Christine Baranski & Julie Walters are hilarious as Tanya & Rosie, respectively. Dominic Cooper, Andy Garcia, Cher & Meryl Streep are superb as Sky, Fernando Cienfuegos, Ruby Sheridan & Donna, respectively. Alexa Davies, Jessica Keenan Wynn, Hugh Skinner, Josh Dylan & Jeremy Irvine are amazing as Young Rosie, Young Tanya, Young Harry, Young Bill & Young Sam, respectively. Mamma Mia! Here We Go Again is a must watch for all ABBA fans. Go & have a really great time!",Mamma Mia! Here We Go Again
49,jrarichards,Going again ... but more bitter-sweet this time,9,14 August 2018,"There's not much doubt as to why the powers that be should want to return to the ""Mamma Mia!"" format ten years further down the line, but a slightly bigger question would concern the motivations of we out here in audience land, first and foremost recalling just how many of those Benny and Bjorn songs were already put to use in the first film...Presumably, we go to see the beautiful young and the comical old (and this time even also the comical young) do their stuff again, against exquisite ""holiday-type"" Greek-island surroundings, and with a solid injection of songs so familiar to some of us at least that we could stand up in the cinema at any moment and sing them right through from memory?If that is the case, then ""Here We Go Again"" from Brits Richard Curtis, Ol Parker, Catherine Johnson, Richard Craymer and so on does NOT disappoint. Indeed, we can argue that, by adding in the odd non-Greek setting (Britain, Paris, Sweden and Tokyo) we enjoy greater diversity and make some telling points about the wonders of free movement. Furthermore, at the Greek end, an unexpected pleasure comes from the lines of wit and wisdom given to more minor Greek-local characters (Omid Djalili as a passport-stamping official, Gerard Monaco as Alexio, Maria Vacratsis as Sofia, and so on) - all the more so as these occasionally acknowledge the toughness and cultural resilience of a Greece that has been through crisis for some years now.However, the far bigger innovation applied here is - for this viewer at least - the far riskier one. As someone a bit entranced by British actress Lily James, and as someone sadly a bit slow on the uptake (!), I was NOT immediately clear about the fact that two timelines were in operation; and - to the best of my knowledge - that is what the makers intended. They did NOT say on screen ""19xx"" or ""xx years ago"" - in a way that would have changed my cinema experience ENTIRELY; they did NOT show too many cars or phones or whatever that would have given the game away instantly. Instead, therefore, the first main effect was for me to be suddenly confronted with the idea that the lifestyle and adventures of this glorious, beautiful, sexy, crazy young Donna were already irrevocably consigned to the inaccessible far past, and indeed to the maximum extent possible given that the older, Meryl Streep version of her character was already dead and gone for a year in our present era. Those strong, overpowering truths hurt me more than I might have expected, I must say, and left my ENTIRE experience loaded with a heavy nostalgia that the ""let's try and get on with life anyway"" modern-era story and characters could not fully overcome...The twin-timeline strategy has the further effect of reducing the screentime available to the 2018 versions of Rosie, Tanya, Bill, Sam and Harry (so that's less of Pierce Brosnan, Julie Walters, Colin Firth, Stellan Skarsgard and Christine Baranski - and that doesn't come completely free). Indeed, Colin Firth does not sing solo at all this time, and Pierce scarcely does (a sigh of relief from some for that, but not I must say from me). On the other hand, the young versions of these characters are fun - especially Hugh Skinner as Young Harry, and of course James herself as simply a breathtaking force of nature. We've also now got an extra generation back - in the shape of a grandma and perspective new grandpa for Amanda Seyfried's Sophie - as played by none other than Cher and Andy Garcia, who do (interestingly) get to get their lips around several Abba greatest hits. All of this dilutes down the time available to Sophie herself (acceptable) and Sky (Dominic Cooper has an almost token presence this time). On the plus side, choreography and settings are at times breathtaking, and a particular joy (which we also came to the cinema for) is the doting, colourful, authentic treatment of things like the layout of a hotel bedroom, the appearance of an old British university, a restaurant in Paris, or time spent in an orange grove or a a somewhat run down Greek taverna. This is simultaneously life and larger than life, as many a simple object or sparse and ordinary scene are made to look exquisite here, and that is a great joy - and also in fact a great truth in our lives.At some level, both ""Mamma Mia"" films are imbued with more than a touch of the immortal, the elemental, the fundamental. They are also of course a touch theatrical, but that can come as no surprise, and certainly there is no ""better leave it as a play"" feeling whatever.Overall, ""Here We Go Again"" does indeed resemble its predecessor as quite an overwhelming experience; does remind us of the quality of Abba's tunes (if very occasionally with grammar mistakes in English!); does tell us that Greece is a wonderful country and that mixing between nations is little less than a God-given enrichment of our lives (even if the kids arising from that ALWAYS have a more complex time than their parents do - a fact that these movies do not hide). But a simple device to remind us that we are looking at the far past for about half the film would have rectified an emotional-shock situation in myself ... and I guess I'm not quite the only one to be in that situation!",Mamma Mia! Here We Go Again
50,tonypeacock-1,Here we quite literally go again! Dare we?,5,14 November 2019,"Sequel to the first film a decade previously. A musical based on the songs of 1970s band Abba.It is a bit of a damp squid. It basically follows the same formula of the first film. Same characters, yet more appalling songs, displays of dad dancing and some questionable moral behaviour by the character Donna.Cher is squeezed quite literally into the end of the film as the mother of the now dead Donna (Meryl Streep). We see a 1979s timeline showing Donnas rather carefree lifestyle that features young lookalikes of Pierce Brosnan, Colin Firth and the Swedish guy whose name escapes me.The audience is thankfully spared the spectacle of Pierce Brosnan belting out a solo number. Instead he very briefly (and quietly) sings in private. Instead Brosnan partakes in some quite embarrassing street dancing! Unless your an Abba freak who likes listening to some of their less well known numbers like the TV character Alan Partridge then this film is best avoided!",Mamma Mia! Here We Go Again
51,springfieldrental,Busby Berkeley Influence,7,1 August 2018,"Viewers seeing Mamma Mia (2), especially the dance number ""Waterloo,"" will notice a pattern of inventive dance formations. Ol Parker, a relatively new director with two minor efforts, has absorbed the films of choreographer Busby Berkeley, who will be featured in the second edition of the fabulous book, ""The 15 Geniuses Behind The Lens: How The Top Film Directors Shaped The Movies We See Today,"" and has woven, with substantial assistance from choreographer Robert Yeoman, Berkeley's incredible moves in his dance numbers.The first third of Mamma Mia (2) shows Parker's meticulous careful planning, alongside editor Peter Lambert, with both his narrative and dancing. The song ""One of Us,"" sung between two lovers on opposite sides of the world, is a showcase of compressing time and space into one of film's most innovative movements. Also, the aforementioned ""Waterloo,"" showcases a brilliant flow of the two protagonists and the restaurant's wait staff, ingeniously copying Berkeley's patterns and dance steps.Alas, if the remainder of the movie were so meticulously designed as the earlier scenes, Mama Mia (2) would be Oscar-worthy. There are some bright moments in the second half, but the viewer can tell that Parker's detail for movement becomes constrained. When Cher arrives in the last few scenes, Parker and his choreograph director have all but given up on innovation and use simple cuts to move the story along. This is still an enjoyable movie, but the potential, as witnessed in the first third, could have made Mama Mia (2) simply breathtaking. Parker shows he has the talent to make his mark in cinema if only he sustains his effort from opening to closing titles.As a footnote, I couldn't shake the image that actorJeremy Irvine, who plays the younger Pierce Brosnan, resembles Patriot quarterback Tom Brady.",Mamma Mia! Here We Go Again
52,tm-sheehan,Just another Cash Cow Sequel-,5,31 August 2018,"Mother always said ""If you can't say anything nice ,say nothing "" but I'm glad say,I didn't always do what I was told and yes, I can think of two nice reasons to see this film Scenery and Cher, apart from that it's pretty bad.
Silly inane script, that could have been written with more skill by high school students . It's just a string of dialogue with lines like ""be still my beating vagina"" put together to fit the most unknown ABBA songs not used in the first Mama Mia film .
Most of the singers like Pierce Brosnan are inadequate although I Iiked Lily James , who plays the young Meryl Streep character. 
Lily is a good musical performer , an acting singing and dancing all rounder and I'd like to see her in a great musical film, perhaps as Elphaba in Wicked.
The few choreographed chorus numbers like Dancing Queen and Fernando are the only musical numbers that worked for me.
Is History Repeating Itself?
In the Depression years of the late 1920's and 1930's many sub standard musicals and some of the greatest film musicals were produced to cheer up audiences in a gloomy world that craved fantasy and escape from the harsh reality of the times. These musicals like Wonder Bar and Roberta also interpolated hit songs of the era to fit into thin romantic plots and often starred the box office giants of the day like Al Jolson and Eddie Cantor.
The difference today is this movie cost 75 million dollars to make and the quality is no better than the little cheer up musical films that cost a tiny fraction of this budget nearly ninety years ago.
Even arguably the greatest musical movies like Singing in the Rain only cost 2.5 million dollars to produce and The Sound of Music 8.2 million dollars to make so at 75 million for Mama Mia 2 I think we're not getting value for money as far as I'm concerned.
I'm hoping Disney will put much more effort into Mary Poppins Returns to be seen later this year.
I'm sure they will as it has a great musical director Rob Marshall (Chicago, Into The Woods ) and a great cast including Meryl Streep , who does have a lovely voice and Colin Firth , who doesn't.
This movie is colourful fun but the old saying sequels rarely work is true in this case, it's just a cash cow to milk from the success of the original movie.
If you don't like musical films you'll hate this if you do love musical films you may also hate this.",Mamma Mia! Here We Go Again

The plot structure, with frequent flash-back sequences were interesting. The musical numbers were almost mostly 'B' sides, you probably need to be an ardent fan to recognise the tacks they used. I suspect almost all the 'hits' were used in the first film.The problem that I have with this film is that the young girl protagonist sleeps with all the 3 possible fathers in the space of a week (ish). Maybe I'm old-fashioned but I feel this sends out the wrong message! The cinema was nice and cool so I we were able to escape the recently sun and heat. This does not compare favourably with 'La La Land', and certainly not 'The Greatest Showman'.",Mamma Mia! Here We Go Again

56,Alexander_Blanchett,"Hopefully they'll never ""go again"".",5,9 August 2018,"Well it was as expected as soft and cheesey as the first part. To be honest what else can you ask for a Sequel to a movie Version of an Abba Musical. ´Still the film is even weaker than the first part as I thought the acting was truely terrible here and the Story line, while intersting, did not really make much of an effort to catch me as the audience. 
Lily James as the young Version of Meryl Streep's Donna did not work for me at all. While the corny Performance by Streep in the original worked and was somehow even natural, here it felt forced, fake and absolutely overthetop. Amanda Seyfried was okay but really did not have many powerful Moments, except for the very last Scene in which she shined. I expected more from Cher because based on the Trailer I hoped it was more than just an Extended cameo. Streep's appearance was even more disappointing. She did have the best acted and most emotional Scene in the film but still, the fate of her character was a bit, well , unappealing Colin Firth, Stellan Skarsgard and especially Pierce Brosnan were fun. Their younger versions not so much. 
Always like Julie Walters and Christine Baranski who were good Sidekicks. The Songs, which I love are Always great, however even that part was disappointing because they were oftne not fully sung or weakly sung or sung during the wrong Scenes and silly choreography. Oh well it was nice Entertainment in the end, but I dont think we Need any more Mamma Mia movies.",Mamma Mia! Here We Go Again

But let's face it they were honest! The trailers promised a soulless re-telling of the original with leftover songs and nods to the original, and that's exactly what we got! I was hoping that maybe it's a bit more, but nope.. still can't really complain!",Mamma Mia! Here We Go Again

I personally didn't think the first one was all that great so I wasn't super excited to see this movie. I can say this one was much better than the first, but it's not spectacular. The plot was fine and it was enjoyable to watch. I enjoyed some of the new songs and the reoccurring ones. The choreography was really good. The singing was mostly good, Pierce Brosnan still can't sing. Lily James was by far my favorite thing about the movie. She did very well as young Donna and I actually liked the character more now. It was an enjoyable movie. My biggest issue with it was that it would never end. There were so many times where it could've ended but it just kept going. It didn't need to be 2 hrs long. My other issue was regarding Meryl Streep, but I won't spoil it. If you've seen the trailer, you've seen the movie basically. There were no surprises and nothing big. Also the placement for Dancing Queen made no sense to me whatsoever. Mamma Mia!: Here We Go Again was an enjoyable happy movie but it wasn't anything amazing.My Grade: B-",Mamma Mia!

The difference between the two is that this had a better and interesting plot.",Mamma Mia! Here We Go Again
63,akcenat,If you like musicals (or Abba) you will enjoy this,7,6 January 2019,"Mamma Mia 2! is far from being perfect film, but this is upbeat, feel good, Abba-licious, heart-warming sequel of 2008 Mamma Mia movie with a thin story, but a fresh bunch of old ABBA lovable songs along with a cast that put a smile on your face. The film has beautiful cinematography too given its location on a Greek Island in the Mediterranean Sea. Like the first film, I will expect that Greek tourism will get a bump from the lovely displays here. Also, don't watch the movie as a sequel because you will not like it, instead just watch it as a completely new film, a separate one. Overall, for me it was a warm, funny and unabashedly campy crowd-pleaser. Also, please be sure to stay for a funny scene after the end credits. So, give your brain a break and get lost in this goddamn delight of a movie.7-/10",Mamma Mia! Here We Go Again

65,dianamarinelli,Not bad but the first one is better,7,12 July 2019,It's not a bad movie it's enjoyable and has some humour to it. The issue was the order of which Donna meets the guys and some plot holes.,Mamma Mia! Here We Go Again

Second Film of Choice at The Plaza Dorchester Tonight - Mamma Mia! Here We Go Again. This was maybe my most anticipated sequel ever. The first film was perhaps the most entertaining summer blockbuster and I've repeatedly watched the DVD both normal and singalong version, I just knew the sequel would be something special. In this film we were introduced to the younger versions of our favourite characters as we are told the back story of Donna and how she ended up pregnant on the island of Kalokairi. This film is pure entertainment, pure joy and pure indulgence and had possibly the most moving scenes ever. I laughed, I cried and I was totally drawn into all the different stories as they all came together at the one ending. It was fun, lighthearted, and I absolutely loved every minute of it. I could watch this film every day and urge everyone to do the same.",Mamma Mia! Here We Go Again

71,joeyford-55342,ABBA is the star of this movie,4,16 August 2018,"The ending bought out Meryl who can't sing and sucks the air from the room with her poison hate politics. The plot of the first one was a girl is so loose she doesn't know the father of her baby, so she picks the last three dudes to ride in her Uber. Then she goes to a Greek Island to hide from responsibility. This movie picks up with that baby walking in her mom's footsteps by opening a hotel on the island. I was bored. Them music was awesome. It kept me awake, waiting for the next song. The dancing was High School at best. The film can best be summed up by a quote from one of its stars, Pierce Brosnan whom I like very much, ""I am not a great singer or dancer but figured I could do as well as the next guy."" Instead of watching this just dig out your ABBA greatest hits CD and listen to it.",Mamma Mia! Here We Go Again
72,kaptenvideo-89875,"If you liked the ""Mamma mia"" before, you'll like this too, just a bit less.",5,23 July 2018,"2008's hit musical based movie ""Mamma Mia"" was a huge box office smash, taking 610 million USD from world's cinemas, so of course there was gonna be a sequel.We didn't quite expect to wait for it for a whole decade, but whatever - it's here now and we can go watch and discover what happened next.The original's stars are back but only in small-ish supporting roles, although promotional materials would surely like you to believe otherwise.Amanda Seyfried's character has been pushed to the background too, actually. The story is about the adventures of Meryl Streep's character in her late teenage years instead, meeting the three important men of her future life and having a baby.I must admit I am not a fan of mainstream musical movies, mainly because of the specific artificial style of acting they use, and never offering proper storytelling or actual suspense or surprises story-wise.""Here We Go Again"" is very much a mainstream musical movie, and a sequel aiming to just offer more of the same - both of which are OK in itself.But the general lazy atmosphere doesn't do the movie any favors, especially evident on the uninspired but professional faces of the old stars back for fat paycheck. I'd even dare to say that all the good bits including the old generation can already be seen in the trailers.The movie's probably good enough for fans of the original. The others will most like veer between somewhere mild boredom and mild amusement - the latter thanks to beautiful locations, visuals and the joy of witnessing famous actors performing evergreen ABBA songs, some of which were also used in predecessor.The younger generation of actors led by Lily James - of ""Downton Abbey"" and ""War & Peace"" fame - feel a bit more soulful or at least fresh.In any case, the material is what it is, not offering any suspense or real surprises nor a proper story-building, as stated above. At least the song and dance numbers look good if not terribly soulful or inventive.Speaking of high-points, I liked the freshness of Lily James, the song and dance number on boat, Cher's appearance and still evident star power despite her age of 71 while filming. And the final song re-uniting two of the main characters is a delight, and worth the wait indeed.As lazy and unnecessary sequels to hit musical movies go, ""MM2"" is totally acceptable, and it's made for fans anyway.One can derive some lightweight pleasure form it as a piece of escapist entertainment - with all the scenic views, good-looking people and classic ABBA songs performed by famous faces.(Speaking of lightweight, I don't appreciate some of the man-hating jokes they do. This kind of jokes shouldn't be part of mainstream movies in 2018.)The movie as unambitious as this doesn't deserving serious critical bashing but it's not really that fun either. Then again, considering the strict criteria of how such project must look and feel, we can't blame the lacking creativeness of debuting screenwriter-director Ol Parker either... probably.",Mamma Mia!

Meryl once again falls flat as a girl with so many men she doesn't know who her child's father is -- so she gives her three.

 Again they screwed with the fans and did not delivered the original abba songs performed by abba.
 instead we got useless and inferior remake songs which are an insult to the original and best efforts.
 just watch how the killed the WATERLOO song. my god.....
 I would really give a 10 out of 10 to this movie if the songs which were the biggest part of the movie were the originals.
 thank god there were a few decent performances by cher and lily james but that won't save it.
 why they kept out the originals million of fans loved is smg I never will understand.
 so instead on a straight A I give this movie a B- and the cd O.S.T a D grade. ps. when u get the dvd watch the movie with the original abba songs playing in your cd stereo.",Mamma Mia! Here We Go Again

It may not be the most sophisticated of narratives but there was a certain magic that the star studded cast just manages to bring out. Unfortunately the same can't be said about the sequel, it seemed much like feeling in gaps of details that were simply unnecessary, answering questions that no one really asked and recapping what we already knew.Of Course it's not all bad, the musical pieces and songs were great but unfortunately the rest of the movie just seemed slightly bland and lifeless, which is the complete opposite of what the original was.",Mamma Mia!

There is no life, no magic, no entertainment in the entire film.I like Lily James. In this movie, I would say that this is her worse performance that I have ever seen. Was it very bad? No, but it seemed bland and without character - kind of like the Anakin Skywalker performance in the Phantom Menace.The other performances were as plain as in the first film, but James could not bring the cast up a notch to make this entertaining.The movie felt bland and lifeless and after 45 minutes I removed it from the Bluray player and sent it back to Netflix.",Mamma Mia!

Lily James masters Meryl Streep's mannerisms as Donna perfectly! The first half was a bit slow, but it picked up somewhere in the middle. It ended a little suddenly, though - I didn't realize it was ending until the middle of the last song. Quite a few plot holes (and unanswered questions), which was annoying.

81,eldreddsouza,I feel Cheated by you.... Mamma mia Ah sh.. There we go again.,5,23 June 2021,"Disappointing. The sequel that didn't need to be made.As other reviewers rightly pointed out, Donna (old Donna Meryl Streep) made the first movie what it was. Mamma Mia 2008 is one of the nicest musicals ever made. This one was not only meh, but utterly disappointing. I was excited to watch this because of the young Donna storyline and since the character was played by Lily James who I adore very much. But this didn't mean I wanted Meryl Streep dead. Within the first couple of minutes we come to know Donna dies about 4 years after the time around which the first movie was based. Yeah a Mamma Mia movie completely devoid of Meryl Streep, the one who is the face of this film series is going to be interesting...Anyway with an open mind I looked forward to the rest of it. This just didn't seem to possess the charm that the original movie did. The songs were badly sung. The actors had to sing it? Couldn't they have hired better singers who resemble the actors voices to sing? I'm sorry but the songs were poorly sung and were quite jarring in all honesty. The first movie songs were fantastic and very well sung by the actors. The worst version I've heard of 'Waterloo' is in this film. The guy completely ruined the song.The new songs I just couldn't get into. They were completely nonsensical and I don't see how anybody could enjoy them. There's a grotesque song about kissing the teacher and what sense does it make is beyond me.There was so little of Amanda Seyfried in this and more of other nonsensical stuff that I couldn't care less about. She's been reduced to an ultra side character. Just one song towards the end she's sung which is quite nice and cures you from the other pathetic renditions throughout the film.The first film's music literally gave me goosebumps, but in this I was praying that it would end soon. That pretty much sums up how bad a sequel this one is. Another pointless thing in this film is Cher. She's there just to ruin 'Fernando'. Sorry makers, that didn't work. It made me more annoyed in fact.I wish this film wasn't made and I had been left with the happy memories from Mamma Mia 2008. This money grabbing cheap sequel unfortunately left me with a bad taste in my mouth by the end of it and lowered Mamma Mia for me.5/10.",Mamma Mia! Here We Go Again

Lily James stuns, anyone who had not heard of her before now must surely be a fan from this performance alone. She gushes enthusiasm and reminds me of Amanda Seyfried in the first movie: full of life and enthusiasm and positivity. Add to that she's an amazing actress, she reminds me a little of Elle Fanning in the way she totally immerses herself in the role...nothing held back.

Writer (""The Best & The Second Best Exotic Marigold Hotel"") / Director (""Imagine Me and You"""") Ol Parker steps in to direct a start studded sequel that in reality didn't need a second look. Sure, it's great to be whisked away to the remote Croatian island of Vis, especially when faced with today's never ending media/social media political bombardment of information. However, Parker is all over the place with his flash backs that are required to make sense of whose younger character belongs to whose older character, and to ensure those not familiar with the film get reacquainted with the productions original location. In addition, he can't seem to decide if his responsibility was to present a legitimate storyline, interject as many Abba songs as possibly, set a stage of various poorly lip-synced interludes and lazy choreography (the song/dance scene between Cher and Andy Garcia is just one of many examples), or provide an opportunity for costumer Michele Clapton (""Game of Thrones"") to show off ""Abba"" wear, or cinematographer Robert D. Yeoman (""The Grand Budapest Hotel"") to wow us with the islands beautiful landscape. Yes, everyone in the original film is back, with Cher joining the group. However, Cher alone can not, and doesn't not, make a film a success. Luck for us all, the cast does a much improved attempt at singing, although the guys continue to be the weak link here, and everyone (including Cher) just can't seem to make lip-syncing believable - one only needs to look at ""La La Land"" and ""Moulin Rouge!"" to see lip-syncing presented right.

People worship at her altar as if she saved humanity from an asteroid, but I just don't see it. She isn't particularly attractive, and none of her movies are really that exciting. Her acting is ok, but I have seen countless others who match or surpass her. Who is she blowing in Hollywood? Everyone?

I can understand Meryl having the good mind not to. Thank good I never paid money to watch this rubbish. Even a pity that Benny and Bjorn made an appearance in this one.

88,lucasnochez,Film Review--Mamma Mia: Here We Go Again/www.nightfilmreviews.com,1,30 October 2018,"So...here we go again!After nearly ten years since the original Mamma Mia, the hit Broadway musical and box office hit film (generating over $600 million at the world wide box office), returns for another dose of ABBA inspired music and sing-alongs that fun for the whole...rather female family.Acting as both a sequel and prequel, Mamma Mia: Here We Go Again continues from the first film, showing us just how Sophie (Amanda Seyfried) plans to re-open Hotel Bella Donna in the beautiful Greek Islands while being pregnant. With the help of only one of her three fathers Sam (Pierce Brosnan), Sophie does everything in her power to give the best grand opening party ever. Yet, for the first time in all her life, she has never felt closer to her mother Donna (Meryl Streep).While Here We Go Again is such as silly and absurd as its predecessor, the truly best parts of the sequel, aren't the sequel aspects at all, but the prequel aspects. The majority of Here We Go Again. showcases a young Donna (Lily James) and how she came about to Greece and how she came to meet (and fall in love) with the three influential men in her life, including a young Harry (Hugh Skinner), an young Bill (Josh Dylan) and a young Sam (Jeremy Irvine).While Here We Go Again is surely meant to be Sophie's story, especially given Sophie's pregnancy with Sky's (Dominic Cooper) baby, the move never quite allows Sophie to being the star. Always in the shadow of her mother and what an amazing woman and presence she was, both in a narrative sense and reality sense, Seyfried's Sophie is constantly overshadowed by both Meryl Streep's Donna, and now, Lily James' Donna. Both Donna's are shining examples of just how exuberant, vibrant and lively Donna really is; a soul who leaves her friends on a whim, travels the world with no regrets, and gets into bed with any cute man that puts in any effort to sweep her off her feet. Whoops!Its in Here We Go Again where the audience can truly appreciate the amazing absence of the amazing Meryl Streep and her interpretation of Donna, and James is more than up to the task and does an incredible job of brining to life a beloved character.One of the more disappointing features of Here We Go Again is the void of Streep on-screen. While much of the marketing and promotional advertising promises Streep in the newest film, her return is not for quite long, and overshadowed greatly by her mother, Ruby, played by the queen of glam and glory, Cher. While the queen of disco only shows up very late in the film, she does what Cher does best, providing the film with its fair share of sass, attitude and divine diva-ness that capsules the film into queen like status, yas!While Mamma Mia: Here We Go Again isn't the most spectacular musical you'll watch, especially after such genre-defining work on La La Land, you can sure bet that this latest instalment of the popular ABBA pop group's discography, will one a huge hit amongst women, mothers and inspire an onslaught of mother/daughter dates for the remainder of summer 2018.",Mamma Mia!

90,iguth,Beautiful sequel,10,27 April 2019,"This movie is a faithful sequel to my favorite film of all time Mamma Mia! I love film sequels that take place years after the original while also starring the same cast years later, it allows the character to age naturally and well. I only have two issues with the film. One would be the total lack of Meryl Streep in this film. She was such a massive part of the first movie and it is sad that she wasn't given the opportunity to explore her talents some more in the sequel. The second is the presence of Cher. She really serves no purpose and has no reason to arrive in this movie, she definitely does not deserve to run the final number. The main story of young Donna (although not very faithful to the story set up in the original) is absolutely fantastic. The movie has some funny parts and the cast that plays the young versions fit perfectly with the current actors. The songs are well done, it is nice to see the original Mamma Mia! cast in an older setting, and I must reiterate again that in my opinion, Lily James and those who star as the young cast absolutely carry this film into what it is.",Mamma Mia!

The entire movie had great atmosphere, loved the warm and colorful theme around, the movie cinematography was incredible. This movie is a wonderful cheer up movie. It makes you forget the reality and just sinks you in the world of the happy musical. I was singing the songs long after the movie ended hah!

92,azanti0029,A mediocre sequel which suffers from not being filmed in Greece but not without its moments,5,14 October 2018,"Although musicals often don't translate well to screen the original Mama Mia was one of the few that succeeded. Camp as tits with half a cast who couldn't sing for toffee but just had fun playing along, it just worked. Tonally it was perfect and knew and understood its audience. Now years later comes a sequel which frankly wasn't really needed and reeks of 'Let's grab some more cash.' That said its not without its moments of joy. The premise without giving anything away is Sophie (Seyfried) has inherited the hotel from her late mother and has revamped it for a grand opening. As she toils to get it ready to honour her mothers memory the story flashes back in time to the events that led her mother to the island in the first place and indeed the circumstances under which she met the three men whom later would become Sophie's three adopted fathers. So it is here that we meet the younger version of Donna, Sophie's carefree mother (Lily James, excellent) and the younger versions of the three men who would attempt to woe her and bed her. In the present the three dads and remaining friends of the late mother (Walters & Baranski stealing every scene they're in as always) all join together to support Sophie in the grand opening and attempt to rectify things when a storm threatens to ruin everything. There's a couple of sub plots involving lost loves and unrequited romances but these frankly could have been left out. Cher arrives at the end in a role which really offered nothing to the film and everything is ultimately resolved in the feel good way you would expect. The good things this time around it has to be said are the younger cast. Walters and Baranski aside the younger cast steal the film here and their subtle nods to their older selves in their performances are to be commended. Alexa Davies, Jessica Keenyan Wyn, Hugh Skinner and Josh Dylan are all especially good. The other men including the older versions really aren't given that much to do. There's a couple of nice moments with Brosnan and much fun to be had with Firths scenes with Omid Djalili but overall laughs are a little thin. The musical numbers with a couple of notable exceptions just don't seem as much fun but the biggest problem the film has is the setting. CROATIA IS NOT GREECE guys. I mean seriously, if you're going to have shots of your town, at least spend some of your budget on some CGI blue shutters and maybe a Greek flag or two. While the two countries might have similarities they're markedly different in a number of ways. I know this was mainly a problem with Greece not being able to get its act together with its film commission and tax breaks but hey, it ain't like you didn't have the budget people! Maybe knock off a million from Chers salary instead. I really think the film suffered from this decision. Those things said there was much to be enjoyed here and its comfortably familiar for many I am sure. The cast again must take all the credit for making it watchable. Will there be a third? If so, lets hope Greece has got it act together because you do know shooting that church from a different angle at an entirely different place didn't work at all right?",Mamma Mia! Here We Go Again

97,patsworld,Could Have Done Without Cher,6,29 July 2018,"Cher looks like a caricature of her former self and to me, she and a lot of actors and actresses for that matter, eventually should just decide to hang it up and let memories of what they used to be stick with people. Cher could use her voice in voice-overs or commercials or just sing on CDs or something but she looks ridiculous to me. And yeah, I know she's really old, but even so, she looks ridiculous. I much, and I do mean MUCH, prefer the folks who allow age to come along as it should - to me they are beautiful. But those who have indulged in tons of plastic surgery and augmentation of some sort of another surgery look foolish and even older than those who age with grace into a natural beauty. At any rate, the movie could jolly well have done without Cher and been better for it. The premise was good, combining past and current characters was a clever touch. Just wasn't nearly as good as the first Mama Mia though.",Mamma Mia! Here We Go Again
98,paulijcalderon,What!? I actually felt it was more sincere than the first?,5,19 July 2018,"Part of my family is visiting town and they are big Abba fans as it's been a very influencial band for them. Naturally they got curious, it being the premiere and all. They say it's the return of the ""feel-good phenomenon"". Well, I thought the first film was extremely cheesy with obnoxious moments and excuses to shuffle Abba's songs in an easy box-office draw. The three dads thing was the only part I found entertaining. So I got dragged to see this with a group of people... and I was pleasantly surprised that I liked it better than the first one. It's not saying much, but I felt there was more merit this time around.While it's still very silly with the plot. The execution, direction and structure of the story feels more creatively thought out. I liked the way the past and present connected with each other. The parallels actually gave meaning to what was going on. Seeing Donna's, let's say ""origin story"", felt sincere and sweet. I bought her reasons for buying the hotel on the island and the character was overall easy to side with as she began her travels. The cinematography was good as we get to see some nice summery imagery of the ocean. The songs are of course great, but they are honestly worked in better with the plot this time. At the end of the day we still get some shoehorned musical numbers, like one with Cher and Andy Garcia. The song is wonderful, but the scene comes out nowhere and simply feels rushed. Lots of decent characters are wasted or sidelined, especially the three dads. And there's a sudden ending with no real resolution.I didn't think I would ever write so much about this movie, but there were elements I enjoyed. The obnoxiousness was scaled down and many parts were taken more seriously. Which is what I appreciated. When you are in a musical world it's gonna be hyper realistic and full of conveniance. But it's important to breath it out with real moments too (and less Broshan singing). By the finale the emotion felt more earned than it deserved to be. And that's to do with the parallell story of the mother and the daughter. Which was fleshed out because of the ""prequel"" story with Lily James doing a humble performance as young Donna. That's not to say that the whole movie is good. No, there are ridiculous scenes and it ultimetely becomes painfully average. It's a calculated crowd-pleaser. But there's an aspect of this sequel that was OK. And it's that they made an effort to take things a tad more serious with some more ideas thrown into the direction. That alone makes it a somewhat enjoyable experience that actually comes across as sweet at parts.",Mamma Mia! Here We Go Again
99,ksdilauri,"No surprises, just a good time.",8,25 February 2019,"Let's be honest: this movie, and its prequel, don't pretend to be on par with the Classic Musicals of Filmdom. The slight story would be crushed under the weight of such a talented cast, but it's saved by the real star of the show---the music. The plot simply goes along for the ride. It's meant to be nothing but lite, fast, and fun, and that's just what it is. There's not as much Meryl Streep to enjoy, but at least there's some---and having Cher show up makes it better yet. If you liked the first Mamma Mia, its sequel is worth a watch.
(I had to keep rewinding the part in one musical number where Julie Walters, attempting to leap across a patio table, is thwarted by disappearing chorus boys. I'm still chuckling.)",Mamma Mia! Here We Go Again
100,steeleronaldr,Too much wasted talent,7,16 January 2021,"Mamma Mia is a classic movie and Meryl Streep just keeps pulling tricks out of her sleeve. Cher is a Icon, Andy Garcia is a terrific actor and Pierce Brosnan is a legend not to mention Jeremy Irving is a up and coming good actor as well. The rest of the cast I just can't speak highly enough, I thought it was in good taste to get these actors to use their talent. But this one ""Mamma Mia: Here We Go Again"" I felt wasted their extraordinary talent.
Cher was brought in way too late to really do anything, Pierce Brosnan and Andy Garcia both also had nothing to do. The other returning cast members were basically left as a side dish. The music just wasn't that highlighted as in the first. The only real thing this movie had was a good concept that didn't shine as bright as it should have.
All that said, they could have brought more in on Donna and how she passed away, by the time you get to the part where Meryl Streep finally makes an appearance you basically forgot about her. Dominic Cooper (her daughter's husband) just didn't have anything to do with the story. He was basically written out of it with bits here and there. By the time we get to Cher there ain't much left so her character had diddly squat to do. Cher should have been written in a lot sooner than she was. All she did was sing one song (a ballad at that) and was done.
Though the movie focused on learning Donna's past they could have made it more interesting. This movie was actually too dialogue heavy to compete with the first. It's a good movie just doesn't use it's cast cause even Pierce Brosnan didn't have anything to do.
Still with all that I give it 7 star's cause the movie tried. It is better than most sequels but as someone stated not all movies needs a sequel. They should have had Donna alive and helping prep for the baby and have her friends along to lighten the load. Using her character as a passed away one just made it I think harder to tell the story. They also add things to dwell on with it. Still it's a good attempt at the same time. It's a good watch when there is nothing else to watch on TV but that's about all",Mamma Mia! Here We Go Again
101,pal05052003,Different tone but still got it,8,30 September 2018,"This installment was hard to watch at first. The songs seemed crammed into the story, and the transition from story to musical numbers was jarring but in to the middle of the story, the narrative and musical numbers fitted. The casting choice for young Donna, and her two friends were pitch perfect. Lily James perfectly captured the spirit of what Meryl Streep's Donna would be like in her youth. Alexa Davies and Jessica Keenan Wynn were perfect younger versions of Rosie and Tanya; who were played by Julie Walters and Christine Baranski respectively. Not only did they act like their older versions, they actually look alike. The male casting for the younger versions of Pierce Brosnan, Stellan Skasgard, and Colin Firth were not as good, but their performances were decent. Moreover, Amanda Seyfried still manages to provide the core to the story, although she plays a more matured Sophie. The narrative shows Donna's history through the context of Sophie, and in this role Seyfried was perfect. Furthermore, the singers were all better, and Lily James can sing well. Moreover, Cher's appearance as Sophie's grandmother was a good idea because not only did she give a great rendition of the song Fernando and the closing number, but only she seems fitting to be Meryl Streep's mother. Compared to the first Mamma Mia, this is more of a musical drama than a comedy but it ends making you feel good.But please no Mamma Mia 3!",Mamma Mia! Here We Go Again
102,elmoslively,Pleasant but slightly disappointing.,7,20 April 2019,"The first thing we have to do is all agree that what holds the Mama Mia! films together is the timeless music of ABBA. And this film does an adequate job of highlighting some of their great hits (Cher's version of Fernando is fantastic!), along with some lesser known songs that were mostly album fillers back in the 70's.Unfortunately some of the young supporting players weren't very good singers, but the main cast was entertaining.This is just an okay follow up to Mama Mia! which starred Meryl Streep, who's very much missed in this sequel, with only a few brief scenes.

Those voices of Agnetha & Frida were incredibly good & its just a downer when someone comes along thinking they can sing those songs as well! Leave them alone! Lol!The storyline is very formulaic.

This new film is far superior.It still has some of the same problems (shockingly fake green screen backgrounds, lame choreography, obivious plot twists, basic editing, lame humor ect.) it has improved. Esspecially with the actors! Meryl Streep and Pierce Brosnan are barely in it (thank god...) and the actors playing young Meryl Streep and friends are really good, Cher was alright. And most of the songs are good.The young adventures of Meryl Streep's character was wonderful. The rest of the film was passible.As a man in his mid 20s, I'm not in this film's target audience. It serves as vicarious entertainment for women and young girls (similar to the Fast & Furious series to men and young boys). While the film is passible (carried by the actors) the direction is flat, the editing is boring and Cher isn't in it enough.It's no Chicago, but it's okay as a lazy sunday movie or as a film you throw on for background noise.",Mamma Mia!

110,shimenpf,Beautiful story and wonderfully executed,7,13 October 2019,"I think the key of this movie resides in two elements (aside from the amazing songs): 1) The characters. They're all lovely, they relate to each other in sweet and tender ways, and, at least in my case, I liked them all and wanted all of them to win; and 2) The magnificent way the screenwriters weave the past and present storylines in such a way that each past moment relates perfectly relate with the present one. The conflict of the story comes from the three 'boyfriends' of Donna and her ups and downs with each in the past storyline, and in Sophie's struggle with the hotel in the present, and both work wonderfully. The theme is powerful and it shows in both storylines: to live for yourself and not for the others.

Boy, was I not disappointed!
The original cast is back - which I was so relieved about - and are just as good and hilarious as ever (especially Tanya). They include some of the songs from the first one, but add in other ABBA songs which I had not heard before, and I really loved them. Some of the dance scenes looked and felt like they were trying to replicate some of the dancing scenes from the first movie and that made it feel a little lackluster at times, but it's only a minor complaint and something I only noticed in passing as I was completely engrossed.
I don't think that the flashbacks were necessary, but they were quite good and provided plenty of laughs (and cringes) and I don't think they impeded on the movie one bit.
It's quite emotional at times, and just as outrageous and preposterous as the original and I loved Cher's song sequence with the guy from Geostorm.

Her mom. I was quite disappointed at the end of the first film when she and sky weren't married and it doesn't seem they're married here either. It's disappointing to see multiple generations of children born out of wedlock glamorized. Which leads me to my last point: two films and we still don't know who Sophie's dad is? I get it, Sophie doesn't care and doesn't want to know but DAMMIT THE VIEWER DOES.

It was a really happy fun story, that made me want to sing and dance the whole time while really enjoying the story. Mamma Mia - Here We Go Again... It's a sad story! I felt emotional most of the time, missing Donna, feeling for her, for her family and friends. And the movie keeps pulling us back to the fact that she is gone and it is so sad...

118,StregaAsuka,Mamma Mia! What a sequel!!,7,22 July 2018,"As Amanda Seyfried said in one of her interviews, when I heard that they were making a Mamma Mia! sequel I was like: not so sure it was a good idea, but after watching it (in her case making it), it really was a brilliant one!Here we are presented with the continuation of the original story 5 years later. The story of the movie is quite simple and you can guess all of it from watching the trailer (pay attention and you will notice that all Meryl scenes on it are from the previous movie). Donna passed away and Sophie wants to open the hotel that her mother dreamed of while we also discover the past of Donna; when she met Sophie's three fathers.Everybody is back for the movie. As in ""everybody"" is back, plus there are new faces like the young versions of the grown ups from the first movie and Cher, who sings Fernando and reminds you of what an amazing voices does she have. Among these faces there is the fantastic Lily James who, together with Amanda Seyfried, carries on her shoulders the weight of the whole movie. And she not only does a wonderful job of it but she is the movie. You feel like watching a young Meryl Streep on-screen and something more, because as so good of an actress Meryl is, her singing in the previous movies was ok, which doesn't happen with Lily, as she is a fantastic singer and all the times she sings you feel like standing up and joining here on screen and do some karaoke. Quite exactly like happens with Amanda. They both stand out when they sing. As for the other younger versions of the oldies, they have been simply perfectly casted (specially Donna's besties). They behave and act like their older counter parts.As for the songs. We are presented with a whole new batch of ABBA songs, like: When I kissed the Teacher, One of US, Kisses of Fire, Angel Eyes, Knowing Me Knowing You, The Name of The Game or Fernando. There are also some from the previous movie that are new versions: Waterloo, I have a Dream, Dancing Queen, Mamma Mia or Super Trouper. Here I need to say that all new versions of the songs that were used in the previous movie, are simply awesome. I personally like the Mamma Mia version much better than the previous one (Lily James has the perfect voice to play the tunes with the needed force) and also the Supper Trupper one, with everybody, as in everybody singing, simply makes your skin go into goosebumps mode because of the feelings you receive.After watching this movie you will feel like how you felt after watching the original one or the stage musical: you will just want to start dancing and singing everywhere. but most important you will feel full of life and happiness.

119,Birminghamukengland,"Depressing, amateurish in places, not one person can sing.",5,21 July 2018,"I saw this yesterday and being a big Abba fan years ago was looking forward to it. The cinema was rammed and each showing was full following.
SPOILER:
Due to the death of Donna which you are informed about from the start, the rest of it is based around that loss and the sadness/nostalgia of it all.
The songs chosen were generally slower/emotive than Mamma Mia although of course they squeezed in Dancing Queen and Waterloo etc.
The singing from each cast member really is diabolical and even with auto tune it could not be fixed.
Lilly (the lead) tries her best but is no professional singer.
Why on earth they didn't choose musically theatre trained professionals I don't know. I guess names sell over talent.
The setting was picturesque in Croatia and the cinematography good, the story flows well and you don't need to be Stephen Hawkins to follow it!
The original cast members have aged considerably and was more like a geriatric meet up rather than a celebration. Colin Firth appeared bored to be there and very lack lustre.
Cher's appearance was just plain odd but was entertaining as it looks like Michael Jackson is walking down the steps (she eats well and doesn't smoke and drink, that's why she has smooth skin....apparently ;-)
As the ending draws close and Meryl appears, I have to admit to finding this VERY emotional, but I found the whole film rather depressing anyway being based around death. I didn't feel uplifted or happy following seeing it.

But all the best songs were used in the first film and to much better advantage. The singing and dancing in this film are at high school level, at best.BTW, what happened to Amanda Seyfried? She looks like death warmed over. Or perhaps I should say, tanned over. I didn't miss Streep since I can't stick her at any price. I don't care how good an actress she is. The rest of the cast? I can't remember it. I think Cher was in it, looking like something out of Madame Tussaud's. And Vis, Croatia, while beautiful, doesn't come close to Skopelos island, where the first film was shot. And you can tell the two places are not the same.All in all, this was a phenomenal disappointment. I'm not big on telling people what to do, but I would strongly advise you to stay away from MM2.

I see films like Pitch perfect - they have similar boring and stupid plot, but there girls can really sing. In this film... well, Lily James just cant get this role with her voice.

Besides, so many plot holes, like the fact that Cher represents Meryl Streep's mother, despite the fact that one was born in 1946, another in 1949. Then Cher points the afdair she had with Andy Garcia in 1959, when she was 13 years old and he was 3 years old (the actor was born in 1956). So the ages don't match. Then we have tye Stellan Skarsgaard charaxter here, who is Swedish, and is receiving an award in Stockholm in English, and then he speaks with his Swedish mother and Brother in English as well instead of their mother tongue. Even the Greeks in the story rare all fluentn in English in 1979 (when the country was leaving its recent military dictatorship, and very slowly being incorporated into Europe).Greece in the 70s you had very people speaking English (most tourists were continental Europeans, so French and German probably would be more common).So I feel like it was a wasted opportunity to present Abba for a new Generation.

127,bob-1135,Well that's two hours I won't get back!,1,28 December 2018,"Must be one of the most disappointing films ever. Being a big fan of 'Mama Mia', saw it onstage in Cardiff as well, I was eagerly looking forward to this film. What a complete load of rubbish. For a start it is telling two stories at once, one is telling the story of how Donna met her three lovers and eventually started the hotel, and the other is how her daughter re-opened said hotel. Unfortunately it shifted between the two without a pause and it was twenty minutes before I realise what was going on.
In the original the songs exploded on to the screen with excitement and verve, here they just limped on and straggled off. How on earth you could reduce 'Waterloo' to a cheesy rendition in a Paris cafe I've no idea but they managed it.
They wasted some incredible talent. Christine Baranski and Julie Walters seemed to be in it just to fill screen space, no idea what Andy Garcia was supposed to be doing, he just lurked in the background for the entire film, and as for the appearance of the plastic Cher - what on earth was that about?
The original had incredible energy and life, this offering dragged on like a dying cat.

128,pedroquintaoo,Here We Go Again for a great sequel,8,31 July 2018,"I don't like musicals but Ioved the first Mamma Mia, so I must confess I was so excited to see this sequel/prequel, even knowing Donna, my favorite character from the first film, was dead.
Here We Go Again tells us the story of Sophie trying to open the hotel to homage her deceased mother while he learn about Donna's past. It's a funny and incredible story, full of great songs that made me shake my head slowly.
The new characters from the flashbacks have great voices but no one looks like the same characters from the present (except Rosie and Tanya).
Amanda Seyfried has a wonderful voice, she's a talented actress and singer during the scenes where she sings. Talking about the musical acts, in my opinion they are good and well executed that the first film, however I was expecting to hear Chiquitita and The Winner Takes it All (my favorite song from the first film). The best songs from Here We Go Again for me are: When I Kissed the Teacher; Waterloo; Knowing me, Knowing You; Dancing Queen; Fernando; Angel Eyes; and I've Been Waiting For You.There are some surprises, unfortunately a lot of them were revealed in the trailers, but the biggest one happens in the ending and I bet how almost made a lot of people crying.
I loved this sequel and I want to see a third installment.Rating: 8/10Despite some timeline problems (probably Cher's character would be 90 years old in this film and Sophie would be 30 /40 years old), this is a fantastic sequel, I recommend to everybody who loved the original film.",Mamma Mia! Here We Go Again
129,LuvSopr,Richer and truer to Donna and to the spirit of ABBA,9,28 December 2018,"The original Mamma Mia! was obviously going to be a hit, given the popularity of the stage show. The success was treated in a sneering manner by the press, picking over Pierce Brosnan's questionable vocal abilities and over the garishness of the film. Enjoying the film was treated as a reason to feel shame. You're one of THOSE people. While Meryl Streep won praise for her boisterous and committed performance, many failed to understand what Donna meant as a character to many viewers, especially female viewers who so rarely got to see a middle-aged woman finding love again, singing, dancing, living life on her own terms.I imagine that love is one of the reasons the sequel got a negative reaction in some quarters. Considering that Meryl Streep doesn't do sequels, it would have been understandable if she had bowed out of another film entirely. It's to her credit, and presumably her love for the project and for Donna that she agreed to return for a few key moments. And I actually think her presence, as well as Donna's, were greatly enhanced by what the sequel did with this dilemma. Amanda Seyfried does a wonderful job in this film, stepping into more of the gap left by Streep's absence (I'd say it's one of her best performances), but the film is still Donna's through and through.Streep was terrific as Donna, but she is also such a legend that it's impossible to escape the fact that you've been seeing her in many films for many years so you see the actress first, not the character.While Lily James has also garnered her share of praise in the last few years, she is still new enough in her career to where she can more fully blend with the character. She gives an absolutely wonderful performance - one that would have gotten awards consideration if the usual suspects in the industry did not greet these types of projects with a jeer. Singing, dancing, acting, easy chemistry with her co-stars. As a result, while you may start out the film seeing Donna and her story as flashbacks to pad out a cash grab, as the minutes pass you genuinely start to feel, start to see her loves and friendships and her passion for life in a way that you may not have entirely in the original. And in her singing, she also understands the spirit of ABBA music, as the sequel as a whole does in a way I don't think the original quite did.ABBA isn't just shouting ballads or throwing disco shapes. Their songs are often pure emotion, and many of them deeply melancholic. It hurts to ""take a chance"" on love. You may have joy, but also regret. You reflect on the good and bad and wonder what's next. You simply FEEL. And this movie really ""gets"" that - James' deeply vulnerable, almost a capella performance of ""Andante Andante"" being probably the best example. While I don't think the movie did enough to really establish Sam being the love of Donna's life, James does her best to express that here - you can see Donna's incredible vulnerability in singing for him, and how awed Sam is by what they share. Her work in the wordless sequence where Donna goes into labor also adds a great deal to the emotional poignancy of the last third of the film.One of the criticisms of the film is that all the ""good"" ABBA songs were used up in the original, but really, you could make four of these things and there would still be plenty of tunes to dip into. ABBA made many, many wonderful songs, songs for every mood or moment. If the success of the film helps introduce more people to ""Andante,"" ""I've Been Waiting For You,"" ""Angel Eyes,"" ""My Love, My Life,"" ""One of Us,"" etc. then I'm thrilled.MLMY is used for the film's emotional high point, where we cut from Lily's Donna christening her baby daughter, with all the hopes and fears of a new life of a mother, to Meryl's Donna, a life complete, watching her daughter continue the cycle with the christening for her very own baby boy. When Sophie sees her mother, and they sing to each other, everything of the last two films reaches emotional catharsis. Your heart breaks, even as you feel love and hope. The essence of ABBA. Streep and Seyfried are superb - the control and the nuance in this number is, frankly, much more than I had expected from these two movies.Donna closing the church doors, saying goodbye to her family and friends, and to us, could have been a fitting end to the film (and likely the franchise), but they were wise enough to know viewers wanted the ""laugh"" alongside the ""cry"" for these characters, and they end the film on a delightful, splashy production number. It's actually genius, and totally unexpected. Characters young and old unite, putting a big grin on your face. Streep's Donna gets the chance for one last blast of a performance, one last moment with Sam. A proper goodbye. If the christening was the ending the film needed, this performance is the ending the film - and viewers - deserved.I probably would have rated a little lower due to a few issues (I think the film is overlong; the introduction of Donna's mother could have been handled more skillfully than basically just saying, ""Look, it's Cher!""; choosing to delete some of the scenes building up the love between young Donna and Sam makes their relationship feel scant even though they were written as being soulmates; the complete lack of material for the wonderful Colin Firth feels like a real missed opportunity), but the spate of 0 and 1 star reviews made me up my review, as I don't feel they are deserved.If you are into musicals or ABBA, then I'd say give the movie a chance. I enjoyed it much more than I thought I would, and it reminded me a lot of the old Hollywood musicals I love and miss. It's the rare sequel that I'd say betters and even enhances the original, and I'm glad I battled my initial reluctance to tune in.",Mamma Mia! Here We Go Again

133,salonsoab,"Though better constructed than the first one, it is neither as fun or magical.",7,12 September 2018,"Mamma Mia! Here We Go Again is a sequel-prequel of the first Mamma Mia!, that no one asked for. The movie focuses on Sophie (Amanda Seyfried) trying to re-open the grand hotel while she learns more about the past of her grandmother with the help of her family and friends. The movie is really well acted, from both the older actors and the youngsters. The music is still on point, with tracks such as Mamma Mia!, Waterloo, and Dancing Queens standing out like in the first one, but sadly some of the new track don't seem to be as great, therefore making the movie not as magical. The main problem with the movie is the scripting, which fails to narrate a clear story, jumping back from past to present with no sense of continuity, making the story quite confusing. Also, the movie doesn't offer a ""high stakes"" climax, which makes the creation of this sequel even more irrelevant. Even if some of the songs are good, the editing during the numbers is really weird and as a whole the movie is really low energy and not as fun as the first one.
In conclusion, if like ABBA or just want to have a fun time watching a romantic movie, then you should go see this film.Grade: B+",Mamma Mia! Here We Go Again
134,ChristianLeFeuvre,"So much better than the first movie. My my, how can you resist it?",9,27 April 2019,"With the huge success of the 2008 movie 'Mamma Mia!' it was unsurprising that a sequel would follow and 10 years later 'Mamma Mia! Here We Go Again' was released in cinemas.
Both a sequel and a prequel, 'Mamma Mia! Here We Go Again' is set both 10 years after, and 20 years before the events of the first film.
With Donna having passed away a year earlier, Sophie has transformed the hotel and is preparing for the grand re-opening. Tanya and Rosie arrive to offer their support and with Sky away in New York, Bill and Harry seemingly unable to come for the opening and Sam still grieving Donna's death and a storm damaging the preparations, and preventing guests and the publicity reps attending it all seems too much to take on. However, with support and help from Sam and the hotel's new manager 'Fernando Cienfuegos', played by Andy Garcia', and with Sky, Bill and Harry determined to be there, and with Sophie's grandmother Ruby making a surprise appearance and news of a pregnancy, the opening party is a huge success,
The 'prequel' sequences are perfectly intertwined and tell how Donna first arrived on the island and how she met Harry, Bill and Sam, the three potential fathers to Sophie.
I have to say, I thought this sequel much better than the first movie.
Amanda Seyfried, Pierce Brosnan, Colin Firth, Stellen Skarsgard, Christine Baranski, Julie Walters and Dominic Cooper are all back reprising their roles from the first film, and there is even a beautifully touching scene at the end where Meryl Streep makes an appearance as Donna, albeit as her spirit watching over her daughter as Sophie christens her baby.
As mentioned Andy Garcia is cast as the hotel manager Fernando, and Cher makes an impact as Sophie's grandmother. I have to say though that Lily James as 'young Donna' in the prequel scenes, steals the movie for me, her performance is incredible.
There are more great ABBA songs to move the stories along and Cher's rendition of 'Fernando' is terrific.
I did prefer this movie, however, if like myself you remember the first film well there are some seriously obvious errors in narrative continuity, for example, in 'Mamma Mia!' when Sophie is reading out her mother's diary to her friends the order of Donna's encounters is Sam, Bill then Harry, yet in 'Mamma Mia! Here We Go Again' Donna meets the guys in reverse, with Harry being her first encounter, Bill second then Sam, then Bill again. Also, Sam mentions he drew up the idea for the hotel on a napkin with Donna, yet in the second film Sam had already left before Donna even gets the idea of a hotel at the farmhouse she is living in. There are a few more things which don't correspond, but these narrative errors are just a minor niggle to be fair.
Despite the niggles, 'Mamma Mia! Here We Go Again' is a terrific movie.
It has a great cast, it's well directed and it's full of superb ABBA songs. It may not be as camp or as glitzy as the first movie but this film is enjoyable, really funny, and even quite touching at the end (I will admit it, I cried at the 'christening' scene).

Mamma Mia! 2 is a feel-good joyous musical with even more hit music from ABBA. Watching it for the first time I was a bit iffy about it, and I think it was only because I wasn't familiar with the new songs, so I couldn't really get into it. Though now familiar, I am obsessed and can't stop singing them. The acting and the actors were great. Big props to Lily James who portrayed young Donna ever so perfect! This film has great singing, acting, and positive messages with relatable characters. The only problem I believe I have is that the flashbacks don't really correspond to how the story was told in the first film though when watching the film, it's so mesmerizing you just kind of forget about it.

136,iamianiman,Can Mamma Mia be the Dancing Queen of Movies for this Year's Summer?,5,18 July 2018,"Here We Go Again indeed, because in many ways this is a repeat of the first film's fizzy cocktail of big name stars, belting out Abba hits in a fun rom-com set against postcard-perfect Aegean scenes.Oliver Parker directs the sequel to Mamma Mia! - the smash 2008 movie of the hit stage musical. A decade later, Donna's (Meryl Streep) daughter Sophie (Amanda Seyfried) is pregnant and worried that she'll not be able to cope with motherhood. By way of advice, Tanya (Julie Walters), and Rosie (Christine Baranski), take Sophie on a trip down memory lane. We learn how Donna fronted her band, The Dynamos; founded her Greek island villa; met Sophie's dads (Colin Firth, Pierce Brosnan, and Stellan Skarsgård), and single-handedly raised Sophie without the help of her own mother, Ruby, who shows up here in the form of Cher.With a returning cast of reliable performers and a few fresh star turns (and brief cameos by Abba's Benny and Björn), it's the young newbies who shine brightest. As young Donna, Lily James is no Meryl Streep, but does just fine, alongside Jessica Keenan Wynn as the young Tanya, and Alexa Davies as young Rosie. The Abba hits keep rolling, the cast keep smiling and everything is just as it was in the first film, only somehow brighter and bolder. It would be easy to dismiss this unashamedly feel-good franchise as so much crowd-pleasing fluff, but beneath the cheesy topping beats a heartfelt love-letter to motherhood, family, friendship and ultimately, living life on your own terms.Fanciful? Maybe. Corny? Absolutely. Escapist? Definitely. Take it all with a sup of ouzo, give in to the good-natured spirit and this sequel delivers everything you loved about the first movie.

Therefore, you are giving the bases that it will always be fun, exciting, and uplifting. Mamma Mia 2 shall I say is just that. A franchise built around the perfect, and utopia of worlds on the shores of Greece. 
 The sequel starts just about where you would expect, with the unexpected passing away of you guessed it! Meryl Streep! Because when I think sequel I think get rid of Meryl Streep, maybe one of the most prolific actresses of all time. Besides this, the plot of the movie revolves around the plot of the original.
 From the beginning to the end, this film is really not about much, plot isn't really a thing they were worried about. Because who needs a plot when you can have three different young lads in search for the heart of a pretty girl. Because yes they killed Meryl, but the whole movie is about, you guessed it! Meryl Streep! Young Meryl yes, but she was obviously the reason for the initial movie.
 What the movie does offer is some fun songs, more flashbacks to the first movie, and the addition of Cher, with an almost last minute addition that changes almost nothing, but probably got a few more fans to the theatres.

It is a very clever interweaving of prequel and sequel which has some skilfully crafted moments of overlap between the two. Most of the songs are performed well, enjoable to watch and are right for the point of the story they are linked to. The only exception is the pointless and somewhat boring inclusion of Cher (and I like Cher).
Although the setup is similar to the first film, the story is different enough to be have it's own identity.
Listen out for the background music where you get some very deft remixed blends of songs from the first film and other ABBA songs.
The climax of the film is wonderfully touching and had both my wife and I misty eyed - well, being a man, I pretended my hayfever was bad while she blubbed hopelessly. If a film draws you in enough to create an emotional response, it can't be all that bad.

But still, ugh, what a horribly conceived film, made purely out of greed. Lily James as Young Donna is supposed to seem full of life and fun and vitality, but it all felt kind of forced to me. She seemed more flirty and flighty and manic than anything. It was like her big head of gold curls and her teeth were doing half the acting. Also, she can't sing. She's charming but I've come to think she just plays every role the same way. Also, she does NOT look at all like Meryl Streep. Amanda Seyfried is lovely as ever, but that couldn't save it. The plot was muddled. Cher was random. The movie ripped the rug out from under the fandom of the first one. I wasn't even a huge fan of it and as I said, not a major Donna fan, and even I was mad!

However, I didn't think the film was quite nearly as good as the first one. Cher was great and probably the best part of the movie, but the whole time I was watching I couldn't help but miss Meryl. I have no idea why she's not in this film more than 5 minutes, perhaps she had other filming commitments or maybe *gasp* she didn't want to do it, or they didn't want (but I don't see why they wouldn't) Because of this I couldn't help but find the movie to be super depressing. I guess it's good to have some movies that pull on your heartstrings but I almost think they overdid it. 
Also, I couldnt help but try and figure out what year it was supposed to be. I think 2005, but they had iPhones so I don't know! The continuity issues really bugged me. On the bright side, Cher was probably the best part of the movie and she certainly saved the day. Also, the musical numbers were super impressive and by that point, I had already memorized the whole soundtrack so it was super fun to sing along. Overall, I think this movie was pretty good.

The covers they used in the film were ok but not as good as ABBAs, but in there defence, quite often, covers aren't as good as the original. The storyline wasn't particularly strong or expanded on and the constant 'turning great ABBA songs into OK covers and twisting them to fit in a film' didn't really work. There were too many OK covers of songs to expand on the story line. I know musicals have lots of songs in them but they always help develop the storyline. Take the lion king for example, the opening song , circle of life, sets the scene. I just can't wait to be king, shows his desire to become king and what he's going to do as a king and how he wants his future to be. Be prepared, shoes the audience the bad guys plan in a song format. Hakuna matata, shows how Simba shouldn't be worried and how to live his new life with Timon and pumbaa. You get the idea, the songs add to the plot. In this movie, there's no adding to the plot really. The songs aren't really needed unless they are on stage singing as they do.It was also very confusing because they didn't explain what was happening until 3/4 of the way through the film, and no, it was not supposed to be like that to cause mystery and suspension, they just didn't add to the plot. They should have made it clear from the start. Over all, the acting was good. It wasn't the best I'd ever seen but it was still good and rather believable, apart from the storyline cause of the singing and dancing that wasn't needed. I also felt like they added things in just to make the movie longer. There were many parts where I thought, why is Sophie in this scene, it doesn't make sense.

The best part of it is probably the performance of Lily James as young Donna. She delivers a very fresh and young version of Meryl Streep's previous appearance in ""Mamma Mia! The Movie"". She's also got a very believable American accent. The story is kind of old and predictable. You see everything coming. But that's the good thing. This movie knows it. The ultimate goal of the film is to bring people together. I watched it with my grandma, and she loved it! And I can understand the joy of musicals with heart, romance and comedy. ""Mamma Mia! Here We Go Again"" is everything you want it to be. Go watch it (happy time garantiert with a little cringe).",Mamma Mia! Here We Go Again
152,guyzradio,Sequelitis - Not quite up to the original,7,3 August 2018,"Having recently watched the original ""Mama Mia,"" I marveled at the seemingly endless talents of Meryl Streep, and loved the movie in general. I awaited ""Here We Go Again"" with great anticipation and every confidence it would measure up. Unfortunately, ""Mama Mia! Here We Go Again"" did not quite strike the chord of the original for me, although it's not quite obvious why. Perhaps the fact that Donna (Streep) has died since the last story, and so plays a much smaller role is a good start. If anyone fails to miss her presence as a main character, the void left by her absence becomes all too obvious at the end of the movie, where she sings a duet with Sophie. Cher, as Sophie's grandmother, doesn't appear until near the end of the movie, and her role seems almost superficial; the movie would have suffered little if any if she were not included. Conversely, Andy Garcia spent about as much time on camera, but dominated any scene he was in. Jessica Keenan Wynn as the young Tanya had me wondering whether I was seeing a ""youthful restoration"" via CGI -- the similarity was that striking, complete with mannerisms.The other area where ""Mama Mia! Here We Go Again"" possibly fell short was the plot just seemed to muddle along, without much in the way of any serious tension or resolution. We can pretty well predict where it's going. Pierce Brosnan does not solo this time, and there's far too little of Colin Firth and Stellan Skarsgård. The switching back and forth to flash backs of the young Donna, Tanya, and Rosie are frequent, but not too difficult to follow. I gave seven stars because I would have given the original eight. Why the original received a score of only 6.4 vs. 7.3 for ""...Here We Go Again"" is a bit of a mystery, but that might change over time. If you enjoyed ""Mama Mia!,"" then do see ""Mama Mia! Here We Go Again."" It's still full of ABBA music, beautiful scenery, many smiles, and a few tear jerking moments.",Mamma Mia! Here We Go Again

158,ikizdevran-882-254684,Waste of time and money,5,24 July 2018,"Mamma Mia! Here We Go Again fails to bring anything new to the table. It is made purely based on the success of the first film. Hollywood tend to do that a lot. When a film becomes successful, they make a 2nd film out of it, which lacks pretty much everything. First of all, if you want to go to see this film because Meryl Streep is in, don't bother, because she has a scene of 5 minutes in the end. She just sings two songs and that's pretty much it. She is in the front row of the film poster, she is the main image of the final trailer, because production company uses her image to attract audience. These kinds of tricks can be seen a lot, while advertising substandard quality films. Mamma Mia! Here We Go Again has one purpose, and that is to make more money by using the fame of the first film. I failed to understand why they even bothered making a sequel when everything was wrapped beautifully in the first film. Mamma Mia! Here We Go Again is written and directed by Ol Parker. I said written, but I really don't know what he has exactly written, because in the means of story there is nothing.The people in this film are like from a different planet. They live in a parallel universe or something. There is no one ugly in the film. Mamma Mia! Here We Go Again is all about beautiful people, their artificially created problems, fake tears, sadness and meaningless joy. They are all very successful, their secret bonds don't have a resource. We don't know why those characters love each other so much, but they do. The film takes place five years after the previous events. Donna is dead. Sophie (Amada Seyfried) takes over the hotel and builds it from zero. While they prepare for the grand opening, we go back to 1979, where everything starts for Donna. She is claimed to be a free soul and an independent woman, but someone must tell the writer of this character that having one night stands with handsome men on your way to Greek Island is not independence. Young Donna (Lily James) is presented to be a very different girl, but when you watch her behaviors, she is pretty much superficial. She falls in love with a man, gets depressed after he leaves, and in the very same day, she has sex with a different guy because she is very sad. Sophie and her problems regarding the hotel in the present day are told in parallel with Donna's youth and her story, how she met Sam (Pierce Brosnan), Harry (Colin Firth) and Bill, (Stellan Skargard) how she moved to the island of Kalokairi and how she built the hotel.Young Donna's friends Tanya and Rosie, as well as her lovers, Harry, Bill and Sam, are played by actors and actresses who have nothing to do with the actual characters. They all look very different. The story takes place in a Greek island but the film was shot in Croatia and Shepperton Studios in Surrey England. Set up of the sequel is pretty much similar with the first film. There is a song for every situation. The story was created based on the situations in those songs, and there is a song for every character, problem and situation. That's the reason why I said there is no story. It is time for a sad song, a sad situation is created. It is time for a joyful song, and something happy happens. There are very few scenes that can be compared with real life situations. Mamma Mia! Here We Go Again is a complete waste of money and time. I had a good taste in my mouth after the first film, but now that is all gone thanks to this useless film that was made just because of financial matters.The strongest point of the film is its songs. It is satisfying in the means of music. You get to hear songs mostly from ABBA, as usual, and Arrival. After all, Mamma Mia! Here We Go Again is also a musical, but even so, some songs are really bad for my taste. When I Kissed the Teacher from Arrival is one, for an example. Just to be able to sing this song, they created a graduation scene. This is what I meant when I said, circumstances are created based on the songs in the film. I have never seen such a thing in my life. I haven't seen an acting performance worth mentioning. This film was released on July 16, 2018 in Hammersmith Apollo and on July 20, 2018 in the United Kingdom and United States. It has 114 minutes of runtime and made with a budget of $75 Million. With a forced story and meaningless characters, Mamma Mia! Here We Go Again is a film that I will never watch again. Having actors and actresses in the film just because they look beautiful shouldn't be a criteria while choosing your characters. This sequel is so hopeless that even the presence of Andy Garcia and Cher couldn't save it.",Mamma Mia! Here We Go Again
159,bdl7431,"Confusing, forced and bland",6,25 July 2018,"First, at the outset....if you are not a big ABBA fan, and/or haven't seen the original movie....don 't expect much. Here's why....
SPOILER ALERT
The movie is basically the back story of a woman named Donna, who was the Meryl Streep character in the first movie. As such, the movie is a series of...well...flashbacks...except the movie switches between a recently college graduated Donna and her adult daughter as the movie progresses. Donna was killed off in the first film, so for the first time watcher, that is confusing because most flashback movies are between a future and past character, and it takes a while to get your head wrapped around this different presentation.The writing is actually bland. It really is just a vehicle to get in the full catalogue of ABBA songs...ok, I get that...so really the story runs like a series of music videos strung together. None of the main characters has any lines that are memorable...indeed, the best lines come from this motherly owner of a bar and a Green customs official. And there are two pretty good sized holes in the plot...first, Donna sleeps with 3 different guys within a span of about three weeks or so...and manages to get pregnant with what will be her adult daughter in the film, so the daughter runs around talking about her 3 dads....but why did Donna have so much possibly risky sex? And she seems to have money to spend on ...oh, I dunno...food, clothes, lodging...where did this money come from? Also, Cher and Meryl Streep are both advertised as being in the film....but be advised their screen time is rather short. Both show up towards the very end of the film. Cher is on for 10 minutes....and while she does sing, her voice sounds heavily processed. Meryl Streep shows up for the final flashback, which is actually very moving...one of the better musical sequences in the film...but her screen time is limited. This is almost bait and switch.....So hardly a memorable film. If you are going with a ABBA fan...they will enjoy it... you.... well, don't think about it too much.....",Mamma Mia! Here We Go Again

The plot is none existent, as in while the last movie tricked you into accepting the musical numbers as a plot essential moment this one doesn't have a plot, it is more of an excuse for these actors to do an Abba karaoke in a Greek Island. 
The second offender is the singing.
The first movie got a bunch of crap for bad performances but this one is just perfectly horrible to the point I genuinely hope this movie will be death of the series (if they had anymore planned).
Look at the number Cher did with Andy Garcia, this movie has shoehorned in as many songs as it could and as mentioned the plot is not there and the singing is terrible.

ABBA made timeless classic music that did not deserve to be treated to this debacle of a musical (although Benny & Bjorn had a hand in it so they must be hard up). Some really good actors and actresses should be having sleepless nights for some time to come worrying what a dive their careers just took. I don't include Streep or Cher in this because like many I cant understand their hype- many others have far more talent yet no recognition its incomprehensible to me. Cher actually looked like she was made of plastic!. However I digress, the whole film was just pathetic and false while some actors looked in pain for what they were wearing and being asked to do.

171,glasslens,Amazing what a big budget can do!,8,25 July 2018,"Most people either rate this film as 10 or around 3. You know what - it is really both. But how can that be? First of all, the 10 rating - forget the original 2008 film for a moment. Here We Go Again is a cracker of a film which grabs your emotions and does not let go. I exactly understand why Mark Kermode cried - it would be a hard hearted person who did not. We had some great performances by Lily James and Amanda Seyfried and of course the three fathers from the original 2008 film were if anything even better. The final scene which I won't spoil is everything an audience would want and I bet there wasn't a dry eye in the house. Abba's songs stand the test of time absolutely although the use of a few ""B Sides"" put a very slight dampener on this. Production values were very high, far surpassing the 2008 film in every way. Some really great shots - of all the little boats coming in for example, beautiful colour thanks to the modern Alexa XT in Robert Yeoman's hands and tremendous singing and dancing performances from the ""crowd"" and great surround sound all added to the performance. Dominic Cooper was reasonable as he was in the 2008 film but rather wooden. But the choice of the shallow Hugh Skinner with his funny expressions for a quite large part, was a bad choice.Now, sadly, to the 3. Cher was a total waste of space - she added nothing and her painfully artificlal looks made her a ridiculous choice. A good way to get some publicity was the reason for the choice of course, but it didn't help the film for us the viewers. 
The story, as with most sequels that were not planned, spends a lot of time trying to link-up with the original and cannot help but be clumsy in doing so. The audience I was in watched in silence - there was virtually no humour in the film - and somehow the opportunity to get everyone singing along was missing - remember the after-the-credits sing-alomg of the 2008 version which was totally brilliant. All we got was some so-called comedian with a couple of lines of out-take which were not even funny. But it WAS a very enjoyable film and could have been a 10 for me - if only.........",Mamma Mia!

The movie *could* have been a prequel to the first ""Mamma Mia!"" which focuses on Donna's coming-of-age through her multiple affairs, subsequent pregnancy, and being disowned by her mother, which could have been a touching movie. Instead, this movie is only a lukewarm sequel where the characters from the last movie get together with sporadically shown flashbacks to young Donna's life.

175,mbruce007,How Can You Resist It?,7,12 October 2020,"When I heard over a year ago that a Mamma Mia sequel was in the pipeline, I thought...indeed, here we go again. The sequel will take away from the original, I thought, and there would be an expectation in the theatrical world to create another musical stage play that would correspond to the film sequel, and so on, and so on. With the more recent news that the original ABBA have reformed with another album on the way, a much talked-about prospect that people thought would never become a reality, I thought, are we not getting a bit carried away with this seeming ABBA mania some thirty years on from the original glory days? Don't get me wrong, I love ABBA's music - let's face it, who doesn't!?So, I took my seat in the cinema on the much-fevered opening night and prepared myself for a disappointing sequel since, let's face it, many do not surpass the original! I have to say, Mamma Mia: Here We Go Again, is a rare exception to this notion. Not only is it a better conceived film cinematically, it also tugs on the heartstrings in ways that the original doesn't.The film begins several years after the point at which Mamma Mia left off. Half of the film is resolutely in the present as we see a more mature (and pregnant) Sophie (Amanda Seyfriend) on the familiar greek island of Kalokairi struggling to maintain the dream projects of her mother, Donna (Meryl Streep) with one of her ""fathers"", Sam (Pierce Brosnan), by her side. The other half of the film looks back to the 1970s and how the young, free-spirited Donna (Lily James) graduates from Oxford University and goes travelling in order to ""find herself"", all the while encountering the men who would later become Sophie's aforesaid ""fathers"".Lily James gives a fantastic turn as the young Donna (which is more than I can say for the younger incarnations of the fathers, who, in my opinion, have comparatively little personality). The old familiar faces are back again. Colin Firth and Stellan Skarsgard are back on form, and seemingly defy their age, as Sophie's fathers, Harry and Bill. It gives me great joy to see the ever-dependable Julie Waters given the much more prominent comic role that she deserves as Rosie, one third of the original ""Donna and the Dynamos"". Of course, I can't mention her without also mentioning the other third, Christine Baranksi, who makes an equally splendid return as that understated cougar character, Tanya.Ol Parker directs this film, replacing Phyllida Lloyd, and he indeed shows great attention to the musical numbers, of which ""I Kissed The Teacher"" and ""Waterloo"" are my firm favourites. The latter takes place in the surroundings of a Parisian cafe in which staff and clientele suddenly come to life - something straight out of the elaborate musicals of yesteryear. Also of note is the scene where a parade of boats come into the island, reminiscent of the first film, which shows unequivocally that the actors enjoyed every minute making this film.Thankfully, the musical repertoire in the sequel is varied, and a younger generation (of which I am a part) are introduced to some lesser-known but equally brilliant ABBA numbers, the most poignant of which is ""My Love, My Life"". For fear of spoiling the film, I am saying no more about that scene. For lads reading this......yeah, it's one of those ""I've got something in my eye"" moments. Be prepared to surrender your machismo, this is a touching film. And not just for more obvious reasons. While the film sports youthful energy, it is also a reminder that a lot of our treasured film stars are getting older, and no surprise - it is ten years since the first outing....Look out also for the wonderful Andy Garcia in an unexpectedly small part as Fernando (wink, wink) Cienfuegos, manager of the Hotel Bella Donna. And, of course, who can ignore the much-hyped appearances of the pop goddess, Cher - a revelation at 72 years of age. This film is much more than summer popcorn fare - go and see it, how can you resist it?",Mamma Mia! Here We Go Again

It's hard to make a good sequel because as always, it is being measured against the original and any slightest defect starts to erode the presentation; but in the case of this sequel, the empathy, the character build up, the emotional tone, didn't decrease, it just got bigger. And I gotta tell you, throwing Cher into this film as the grandmother was a brilliant touch, because her role towards the end (no spoilers) was a real blast from the past to any of us who grew up with Cher.

Emma Stone a few years ago won an Oscar and a Golden globe for acting, singing and dancing in ""La La Land."" Lily James has 100 times the singing talent that Emma Stone has! And shows more emotion as an actress in her new film. Meryl strep was WOWED by the newcomer Lily James. ""I had no idea Lily James had these singing chops...She shakes the rafters. She's amazing,"" said Streep in a featurette giving a behind-the-scenes look at the making of the Mama Mia sequel.Lily James has a certain charisma in this film, she's beautiful, cute and talented, you really feel for character and the trials and tribulations she has to endure in this film! The film is very well done in a series of flashbacks with Lily James playing the young Donna, mother of Sophie the girl she will give birth to in this film. With the younger versions and older versions of Sam, Bill and Harry appearing in the film. Amanda Seyfried returns as Sophie. But the real star of this film is newcomer Lily James as young Donna. She is a triple treat acting, singing and dancing! This recommendation comes from a former tough newspaper film critic for four years who watched and reviewed one hundred sixty five films a year. Lily James had me teary eyed more than a couple time in this film. 
I highly recommend this film to anyone who wants to see an uplifting fun heartfelt film see ""Mama Mia Here we go again.""

181,The_Film_Auditor,More like a Sing-Along than an Actual Movie...,3,25 July 2018,"Oh god, here we go again... Mama Mia! Here We Go Again makes many of the same mistakes the original film does, including a paper-thin plot, a script that barely connects the music to the story, and one-dimensional characters.The script is by far the worst part of the film, being lazy and contradicting itself multiple times. Normally, a sequel is supposed to add something new to the story or expand on its characters. Instead, the film delves into Donna's backstory, a story we already heard in the original film. Of course, we see the three relationships Donna has with Sam, Bill, and Harry, but all seem rushed and generic. Their storylines also fail to add any detail that isn't covered in the original Mama Mia! The relationships boil down to Donna knowing each man for about a day, sleeping with them, and then never seeing them again. There is nothing new about the relationships that we did not know. No cute surprises or subverting of expectations, just the same old story we heard from Donna and her friends in the original. This film is much more of a sing-along than an actual movie. This is why I would only recommend this film to an ABBA fan that will simply enjoy singing along and not care about the plot. If you are looking for more than an ABBA sing-along, look somewhere else.The only thing I enjoyed about this film was the end credits, not only because it was the best-choreographed sequence in the entire movie, but because the film was finally over.Oh, I also enjoyed the Fat Bastard Cameo. It was a little out of place, but still hilarious.",Mamma Mia! Here We Go Again
182,Christina-Q,"My, my, how can I resist you... and one of us is crying.",10,24 July 2018,"I loved the first one and I've watched it 20 times (I think). So I was sure that I would like this one, because I was counting on the cast and writers, and the magic ABBA's music has. Mamma Mia 2 is fun, upbeat and feel good movie. BUT there is also some sadness in it, which made the movie even better. I think the writers did a great job on this one: it is a sequel, but still works on its own. There are references to the first one, and you laugh more, if you know them. But if you don't, that's all right too. It is cheesy, yes, but it is what Mamma mia is about: escaping from the real world with a smile and a song. (And few tears in this case.)It is great that all the old actors are back, but I also liked very much the new ones. They do a great job, and Pierce Brosnan is always so charmy.There were also some interesting ways to film the scenes, specially liked One of us -scene. Very well made!Meryl Streep could have had more screen time, but when you think about the whole story, this is perfect as it is. And the fact that she hadn't screen time as much as others, made me cry so hard at certain point of the movie. It just shows how timeless and beautiful these songs are still in 2018. When the first Mamma mia was more about fun and crazyness, the second one brings more feelings to the table. I highyl recommend this movie, if you like the first one. But just one tip: have a box of tissues with you, because you are going to need them. I",Mamma Mia! Here We Go Again

If you loved the first film you'll love this as well. I do think the editing and cinematography was slightly better in the first film, but this doesn't make the second a worse experience. In fact, they were able to capture what Mamma Mia! was and developed areas further to create a film on par. Early in the film there was some excellent transitions that fit well with the music portions, more of this please!I'm happy that all the cast was back as well, with some great additions added on top. At first the story decision for Meryl Streep I thought was odd, but as the story progressed it made sense, I just wished what happened was further explained. Lily James played a young Donna really well, with some of her scenes being my favourite.I honestly love these two films a lot.",Mamma Mia! Here We Go Again

189,sanda_moroianu,"A few tears, but mostly laughter",9,4 August 2018,"Not Oscar material, for sure, but an immensely enjoyable film to watch. Especially for a specific audience, whose young years coincide with ABBA's tremendously successful active years. People 'of a certain age' who enjoyed the first ""Mamma mia!"" will certainly be thrilled with this sequel. Everything is better: the musical acts, the choreography, the plot itself, the voices, skilfully accompanied where the actors weren't up the par. Btw: Does Lily James sing so well, or... This film relies mostly on the flash backs about the six main characters, but they bring lots of authenticity considering the period rendered; who cares who was Donna's first, or second, or third, for that matter. I wonder how people in their 20's or 30's - unfamiliar with ABBA tunes- react to this movie. They will probably appreciate the landscapes and the story and in case they like musicals, they'll enjoy the songs as well. I, for one, I came out of the theatre with puffy eyes- yes, I had a good cry several times, going down memory lane- having had a great opportunity to enjoy the film for itself, as well as to reminisce about long lost times. I have no idea why Merryl Streep almost refused to be part of this sequel. I bet she would have been just as lovely as she was in the first one. There is, though, one aspect which spoiled it for me: Cher's acting is almost too painful to watch: she looks like a sinister version of herself, filled to the brim with botox and what not, she can barely articulate words- a terrible ghost of her former self... Otherwise, a light, enjoyable, fun and somehow nostalgic film- a must watch at least for those young at heart!",Mamma Mia! Here We Go Again

It was kind of slow paced compared to the first one. Lily James does a good job portraying younger Donna. Jessica Wynn portrays a younger Tanya and does a really good job. She actually nails it.

194,nickkulstadis,Awful,2,2 November 2021,"Mamma Mia wasn't that good but it was boosted up by a good cast, good location work and the better ABBA songs. Here We Go Again is brought down by a needlessly convoluted plot that exists to sing the lesser known ABBA songs. Such songs like I Kissed The Teacher and I Am The Tiger are featured as they used the better ones in the first movie. Waterloo finally gets used as it was just an instrumental version in the first movie but they used it terribly. This is one to skip.",Mamma Mia! Here We Go Again

196,rosalindsmith-85036,will not watch it again,1,24 July 2018,"I went to the cinema really happy to see this movie and left feeling drained emotional and tearful and not happy. I didn't see any trailers about it other than the one shown in cinemas before. Didn't realise that Meryl Streep wasn't in it as a major character just for 2 minutes at the end in a dream sequence with daughter at the church for the baby's baptism. I liked the actress playing young Donna and she had a good voice. The dancing and singing was good and enjoyable. New songs like ""I kissed a teacher"" was not appropriate. Pierce Brosnan also sang well this time although poignantly as he was singing about missing Donna. I cried all throughout this movie. laughed at the Titantic Spoof moment on the boat. On the whole the people in the cinema were all ages from 19 to 80 yrs old and it was quiet except for those two moments of brevity. A lot of the people agreed with my evaulation of the movie and were disappointed. I looked up in Google and saw reports that Meryl doesn't do sequels and was thrilled that she was handing over the baton to the younger unknown actors.She said she didn't want to dance and sing again as she did it before. So I wont't be buying this on DVD or streaming it on Amazon even if it was free to watch I definitely would not watch this again.I will stick to the first movie as that left me feeling uplifted and happy.

I absolutely loved the first movie, and the sequel failed short in so many ways... The first letdown was of course the absence of Donna. It was downhill from there. I had a general sense that nobody cared to put together a good story. The quality of the screenplay was eerily reminiscent of the one you'd expect in a porn movie (not that I myself ever watched one, of course). To strengthen the feeling, the casting crew seem to have raided the Chippendales for the young versions of Sam, Bill, and Harry. And have you seen the size of Bill's boat? Once again, nobody on the film crew seemed to give a damn about making the story believable. A boat like that would need a sizeable crew, and is not the boat a nomadic youngster would skipper, let alone afford. But they had a budget to burn through I suppose. Obscene!Then there are the songs. They've raided a trove of more forgettable ABBA songs. Nobody stopped to ask why they were forgettable. Hint: because they weren't that good! What made you think they would make for a great movie?Did I mention that the movie without Meryl Streep feels like a plane flying with one of the engines out?

199,essential-23126,A mediocre sequel,3,29 July 2018,"I must first say that this film is worth a look for the music of course, and the well known cast. A poor storyline, sometimes difficult to figure out which generation of the main character was on screen, however performances all very good. 
Frankly for me Cher's solo stole the movie, fabulous!",Mamma Mia! Here We Go Again
200,kostkyrolga,Mediocre,2,13 June 2019,"Let's begin with the positive side of the story. The protagonist, Lily James, did a pretty good acting job, as well as our favorite characters, like Colin Firth and Pierce Brosnan, who supported their roles equally as well as in the first film. (although they didn't appear that much in this movie) Also, I really enjoyed the song recreations, e.g. The Dancing Queen. The songs remained classic and beautiful as they were and gave us flashbacks of the first film.
Now the cons: The first half of the film was underwhelming. I skipped a good part of it, because it was either boring or cringey. In addition, the overall storyline didn't bring us any surprises. Most events were rather predictable and I found the development of the plot kind of childish. We also shouldn't neglect the fact that this is a musical. I found the new songs really disappointing. No creativity, nothing catchy or interesting. It felt like they were singing just to add time to the movie.
Last but not least, this movie as a whole left me a bad impression. It seems that they made this movie just because the first one was successful, so they wanted to make more money. It would have been better if they left things as they were. This movie didn't give me any powerful emotions or a touching and meaningful message, and I'm sure I'll forget about it really soon. I wouldn't watch it again.",Mamma Mia! Here We Go Again

I laughed and cried when I found out Sophie was pregnant. My favorite characters were Sophie and Young Donna. I love Lily James because I want to follow in her footsteps. Sophie particularly was my favorite character because she was pregnant. She had the baby at the end of the movie. I loved to see how Donna met Sam, Bill, and Harry and hoe she got pregnant with Sophie. Overall, I cried. It was sad, but really a cute movie!",Mamma Mia! Here We Go Again

I did not enjoy the first half of the movie, because the movie was kinda figuring itself out, but then it is pretty good. I did not enjoy the present parts of the movie as much as the parts from the past.
Now the thing that i loved about this the most and when i say love, i mean truly love, is Lily James. My god she is so beautiful and her performance is also great. Her performance and her beauty bring this movie to a whole another level. I honestly love her.
The present stuff just did not really interest me and i was not so invested in it as much as the past parts. This movie is just harmless fun with some enjoyable music. The thing that i adored was Lily James and i was not bored and honestly enjoyed it, which i did not expect.

206,scooterberwyn,Far exceeded my expectations.,10,7 August 2018,"Make no mistake, I loved the first Mamma Mia (was it really ten years ago?). It was big, goofy, empty, feel-good fluff with great songs from the ABBA catalogue. When I heard about the sequel, I was really concerned that I would be disappointed. Using lesser-known Abba songs? Meryl Streep absent for most of the film? How could it possibly succeed?Well, it has succeeded, and brilliantly. The story has more depth to it, exploring how Donna arrived at the point where we met her in the first film. Sophie is busy getting the hotel ready for a grand re-opening, aided by Sam because her husband, Sky, is away on business. The characters really come to life, and Lily James and the youthful Tanya and Rose capture the looks and the vocal cadences of their older counterparts beautifully.There's a lot of comedy in this film, but also a lot of heart. During a scene near the end, almost the entire audience in our theater were sobbing because it was so incredibly touching. But it wasn't depressing, far from it.Make sure you stay until the end of the final credits to see another funny scene.

207,AlainAKoningverdraag,Could've Been Better,6,20 August 2018,"The movie had all the resources to be as good or even better than the original.
While I applaud the film makers for their efforts, the pacing was way too rushed up to the scene where Cher makes her appearance. The audience was simply not given enough time to let the emotion of the previous scene sink in; the scenes followed each other at a pace that completely undid whatever emotions the previous scene with it's singing and sometimes dancing created. Whoever it was that decided to rush the pace between the scenes ... crippled it.

While that film left a lot to be desired, I liked it better than director Ol Parker's sequel Mama mia! Here we go again.I really wanted to like it, but as the film progressed, I came to the conlusion that it was a poor film.Sloppy story telling, no chemistry between the actors, the male actors couldn't sing, but to be fair the female ones could. People who had nothing to do with a given scene joining in the singing and dancing which I think is a weakness in any musical, very weak direction, it stood out a mile that Parker was struggling for ideas as to what the actors should do while performing the musicsl numbers. And as for the scene where all the passengers on an approaching ferry uninspiringly sang 'dancing queen', what the hell!?It could be argued that ABBA is Sweden's answer to the Beatles, and that their songs are a masterpiece. It is therefore sad to see them used in this way.I was thinking of saying that this is one of those films that are so bad it's good. But the reallity is it it's so bad that it's bad.",Mamma Mia!

So killing off the Donna was in poor taste. Also, going back in time to young Donna didn't look at all right. They went back in time while in modern clothes and hairstyles. Stories didn't match even a little with what was told in the first movie. Basically, mostly same actors, same songs, different movie with different story unrelated to the first. If it had been portrayed as being many years later it would've made more sense. Maybe. But it was portrayed as being only five years or so later. Not very long.

To just add one aspect that I found annoying: the portrayal of the local greeks (I'm not even greek, so don't think that'd be my motive).
Lazy-ass island bums, just going through their dull days until young Donna comes, rolls up her sleeves and straightens that beautiful mansion that she occupied.
In fact, all of these characters are spoiled brats, which I would even let slip, considering it's just entertainment. But nonetheless its quite annoying watching them rambling around Europe on planes and boats and wanting me to get involved in their pretended problems.I know I know, nobody wants to have a fine movie spoiled by a sourpuss with his cultural science bullcrap. I also don't like it.
But this is not even a fine movie. We've seen it all, so why do another one? Come on, they're even repeating songs from the first one! Who cares about Young Donna anyways? And what bet did Andy Garcia loose that made him degrade himself to a cartoonish mediterranean stereotype?",Mamma Mia! Here We Go Again
216,EdwardNashtonReeves,A charming mess,5,22 August 2018,"Every now and then I get to a movie I am not sure what to think of and this year, it's Mamma Mia 2! It's sentimental, well acted and well sung, and oozes a certain charm, yet, it's convoluted, underdeveloped and has way too many fillers. The main plot is about Sophie missing her late mother Donna (who died from ''insert reason here'') and trying to connect to her through stories about her youth. Lily James stars as young Donna and does a great job! What I loved about this film is Donna's personality and how they managed to make her sleep with all three of Sophie's potential dads without looking easy or selfish. The film also has some really strong scenes involving the mother/daughter connection. The scene when young Donna is repairing her house and Sophie is walking through an already arranged house is very strong. So is the one when Meryl Streep appears later on, again singing with her daughter. Where film fails is inserting a lot of unnecessary drama which just shifts the focus to fillers - Sophie is in a rough period with her husband, wants to call her estranged grandmother, both of her other dads need to come from their obligations... I mean, each of these could have been a strong pillar, but together they just seem unfocused and the worst is how easily each of them is solved, giving them zero gravitas. I mean, does *anyone* care if Stellan Skarsgard and Julie Walters will end-up together again? Songs are hit or miss as well - From the strong, emotional ones (My Love, My Life, One of Us, I Have a Dream) to completely pointless ones (When I Kiss the Teacher, Fernando, Super Trouper).It's like movie doesn't know what feeling it wants to achieve, so it throws multiple darts at the audience, hoping one will hit hard enough. When the film hits the note, it gives genuine feels. When it misses, what's left is frustration because it steals the screentime from potentially interesting story. Donna's story was good and if the film decided to focus Sophie's story on one primary conflict (whether with Sky, Ruby or whomever), it would have been better. How does it hold against the first one? In my opinion, it's better. The first one was a fluff with a weak central conflict. This one at least has emotional parts worth exploring. So, if you liked the first one, this one you will probably like even better. If you are an ABBA fan seeking for something moderately amusing, this just might be it. I am still conflicted about it.",Mamma Mia! Here We Go Again

218,StarDragyn,I NEVER give 1-star ratings!,1,30 December 2018,"This was such a disappointment! Based on the good reviews (higher rating than the first one, here on IMDb) I asked for this for a gift for Christmas without having yet seen it. I instantly fell in love with the first one when I first saw it 10 years ago, without even knowing anything about it or the music of ABBA beforehand. This one was such a flop in comparison.The story was so forced and unbelievable (yes, even more so than the original) and did not flow well at all. It contradicted some points from the original and had enormous story holes. The characters were stiff and unnatural, and their emotional responses seemed out of whack.All of the original characters appear on the cover and posters, but you hardly see any of them except for Amanda Seyfried until the last bit of the movie. Meryl Streep only has a cameo appearance, and she was the best part of the last movie. The new star of the show, Lily James, playing a young Meryl Streep, is a good enough actor, but she isn't given a very good part to act, so her character comes off as flighty and inconsistent. The ads made it seem like Cher would be playing a significant role, but she, too, only shows up in the last 20-30 min and has a very small part. Yes, she sings ""Fernando"" but that's about it.The dance sequences seemed like a regurgitation of the original movie, and half of the songs are on the original soundtrack. Some of them from the actual movie (like ""Mamma Mia"" and ""Dancing Queen"") and some outtakes that were included on the CD (like ""The Name of the Game"" and ""I Have a Dream""). And even the new songs they picked to use are not very catchy and don't fit very well with the storyline. Or the storyline is twisted to try to get the song to fit in.I only kept the movie playing through to the end out of sheer stubbornness to give it a fair shot and truly wishing I could love it. I could tell I wasn't going to like it within the first 15 minutes. And it was so hard to sit through, I know I'm never going to do it again, so I'm going to give away my brand new bluray, digital code and all!!",Mamma Mia! Here We Go Again

B) the past - 3When the film was in the present it was funny and engaging. Good chemistry and fun being had. Great additions of Andy Garcia and Cher. Loved the three Dad's, brilliant as ever. Pierce sadly though barely sings and it feels like they didn't have enough for a whole film with them, so to the flashbacks.This is more like no thanks for the music. It's funny when an established actor can't sing it's not when it's some nobody. Also how many people did she sleep with in a few days? And it's done so strangely. Lilly James is pretty unlikable and the nobodies with her really drag the film.By the end of the film you feel like you've earnt the Cher appearance by putting up with the dross in the middle.It wasn't close enough fernando.",Mamma Mia!

Its narrative line is that Sophie has refurbished the hotel her mother Donna founded. After many not really insuperable obstacles, the grand reopening succeeds.
 We also get the full backstory on how Donna managed to hook up with three guys in succession quickly enough that she couldn't (honestly!) figure out who was Sophie's father.
 All in all, a mildly amusing mess, with ABBA's songs not fitting into the story as well as in the first version.

Donna), and I thought the younger versions of Harry, Bill, Sam, Rosie, and especially Tanya were spot on. I enjoyed the new additions of Ruby Sheridan, Fernando Cienfuegos, and the Passport Checker (wait until the end of the credits to see the best of him). I thought the addition of Bill's twin was a surprise to say the least.I thought the songs were great, and for the second to last number, ""My Love, My Life"", I almost cried, but tried my best not to do so until older Donna left the church. That really got me good. Like I said before, wait until the end of the credits for more of the passport guy. Anyways, I thought the cast pulled off great performances, and Cher and Andy Garcia had a truly surprisingly good chemistry together. Amanda Seyfried, Pierce Brosnan, Colin Firth, Stellan Skarsgård, Christine Baranski, Julie Walters, and Dominic Cooper all reprised their roles, and brought back the same characters they portrayed 10 years ago, and seemed like they had a blast while doing so.",Mamma Mia!

236,garyvanb,"Better Than the First, For What It's Worth",8,18 November 2018,"Mamma Mia 2 was better than Momma Mia, but that's still not saying an awful lot. The music was good, because the music of Abba is good, and second time around, you get a better feel for who each of these main characters are, though about those songs, a lot of the time, they are staged comically. Generally speaking, the young actors upstage the older ones, though I'm starting to get annoyed by Amanda Seyfried's soprano warbling, which I've heard now through three movies, including the first Mamma Mia and Les Mis. I don't know what to think of Cher and Meryl Streep only showing up at the end to sing one song each, though in each case, ""Fernando"" and ""My Love, My Life,"" they do a great job, before joining the rest if the cast for the show stopping ""Super Trooper"". I'll quote my Abba loving brother, who said he liked it, despite at times feeling like he was watching a freak show. So, pretty much like the original with a bit of better singing. And what's with Judi Dench - oops, I mean Julie Walters? With fewer songs by the older male leads, one realizes she can't sing and can't dance either. If that's the case for most of the older cast, as with the first one, one must ask: What the hell are they doing being cast in a musical?",Mamma Mia! Here We Go Again

Lily James was fabulous.The songs, ah... My heart just kept getting broken and glued back. ABBA's music will forever be timeless. I loved that they didn't only go with the mainstream songs, but also went with some lesser know but still superb ones. I'm not one for big parties, but boy could I dance to ABBA all night long.I'm pretty sure that if we were to time the movie, most of it would be scenes where people sing. That's at least what I was expecting from this sequel. And I'm so happy that that's exactly what I got.

241,valinvancouver,Fun enough but I have one big issue with it,6,8 August 2018,"As you likely already know, this sequel takes place in the same place, with additional cast members, a few years removed from the original. Meryl Streep's character, Donna, passed away the previous year and her daughter finds herself pregnant in the midst of opening a gorgeous, seriously over-staffed hotel in tribute to her mother, with the weather and a potential break up with her significant other presenting challenges. The movie cleverly flashes back to the story of Donna as a young woman as she graduates from college, travels through Europe and has sex with three attractive men in short succession, although she swears she's not that kind of girl. Everyone looks fabulous, and with Donna's encouragement, they tend to throw caution to the winds.Normally I'm as happy as the next movie-goer to indulge in a full blown, feel good fantasy - populated by fit and beautiful people - and I did mostly enjoyed this movie. However, the fat jokes were disappointing. The movie invites everyone to enjoy it's fantasy world for a couple of hours, but not so much if you're overweight. Instead, the only doses of reality the movie serves up are for the one chunky cast member, suggesting she's been of little interest to the hot stud until he's too old to sow his oats and that carbs may well be her soulmate (and why is she constantly eating?). Maybe this is the screenwriter's attempt to include a character that most middle aged women can relate to, but then Sophie's grandmother flat out warns her that doing something will make her fat, so I can't give them any credit for sensitivity.As annoying as all that is, the most disturbing for me was the weird bait and switch they did in reintroducing one of the fathers. You think you're going to see Bill, but wait, could that obese man really be him? Oh no, it's a trick, that's actually Bill's twin brother. Ha ha ha. It's completely unnecessary and worse, it forces the movie-goer to be complicit in the joke, because we all know Bill wasn't that fat in the first movie. I'd bet most people were briefly shocked until they figured it out. I'm 25 lbs overweight and judge myself pretty much daily about it. I'd be fine with being confronted with my own fat phobia if I thought that was the point. Instead it just feels gross when it's simply meant to be a punchline.So clearly the movie pushed my buttons, lol.",Mamma Mia! Here We Go Again
242,greggs_nbacon,Better than the origina;,7,17 September 2018,"When this film was announced, it seemed like one of those bad ideas to me. I had no idea why they would go and make another musical based on the music of ABBA. I thought, at that time, that the world was already plagued with their infectious earworms of songs that drove white people of all ages to pure caucasity. I then gave this film a chance, and I was actually pleasantly surprised. Mamma Mia! Here We Go Again follows Sophie (Amanda Seyfried), as she finally fixes the hotel that her mother Donna (Meryl Streep) had spent her life building. She really doesn't care who her dad is anymore as she settles for the Holy Trinity of James Bond, King George VI, and Dr. Erik Selvig as her shared fathers. Donna has now passed, and Sophie is ready to honor Donna in this miraculous way. As she continues Donna's legacy, she (and the audience) begin to find out more about young Donna (Lily James) and how she came to the island. The film surprises in that it uses songs by ABBA not previously used in the first film in a clever and inventive way. The dancing and acting out of these songs makes them feel like the first time you've ever heard them. The young stars cast in the roles of the actors when they were younger were all brilliant, but Lily James steals the show. She has all the mannerisms and idiosyncrasies of Meryl Streep down pat, and you do really believe, as the viewer, that she really is Donna. Amanda Seyfried, with her amazing trained vocals, has finally proved that she can carry a film on her own, and she doesn't need any help. It is time to give her credit for being one of the most talented actresses and musical stars in the game. The film also brilliantly adds cameos from Cher, Andy Garcia, and Meryl Streep. It was almost like they were pushing for Streep's 22nd Oscar nomination. Songs like Waterloo, When I Kissed the Teacher, and Angel Eyes were implemented seamlessly into the film. Though the film had some great triumphs within it, it was filled with lots of faux pas. The film partially takes place in 1979-1980, as Donna's character becomes pregnant within the prequel aspect of the film. It was mentioned in the previous film that there was a particular order in which Donna hooked up with the men. The order was Sam on July 16th, Bill on August 4th, and Harry on August 11th. The sequel goes directly against the deep-rooted tradition that is Mamma Mia! lore and totally screws this order up. Also, the films takes place in the before mentioned time period and 5 years after the original film. In the original film, Sophie is only 20, so this must mean she is 25. I'm terrible at math, but by my calculations, 1980 +25= 2005. If the second film does take place in 2005, why does everyone have current iPhones and Windows tablets? Everyone also knows these ideas that were still in the wombs of Steve Jobs and Bill Gates in 2005. If some crappy blogger sitting at home in his boxers can figure this out, shouldn't a big studio who hires people specifically for this reason be able to? Not to nitpick, but the repetition of Dancing Queen and Mamma Mia! as featured songs in the first and second film felt incredibly redundant. Maybe this was due to the lazy staging in the second film that just wanted a lot of people dancing so we wouldn't focus on the poor vocal rendition.
All in all, this film was an enjoyable flick most of the family could see. it normalizes having 3 dads, so there it has now cured America of Maury. Who cares who the baby daddy is anymore? We can all get along! This film was fun, but it proved the Holylwood is lazy and doesn't care.Grade: (7/10)",Mamma Mia! Here We Go Again
243,thiago-guimaraes-torres,Disappointing,5,8 February 2019,"Not even Cher big entrance with her blonde platinated wig could save this sequel that starts too slow (all the first half hour of the movie could be shrinked), does not explain what happened with Donna and messes all the script of the first movie.

244,abchulett,"Takes a while to warm up to, but carries the day",6,12 August 2018,"It's hard to win if you're a sequel. Usually such movies fall into 2 categories: Too much like the first one so we've already seen it, and so different from the first one that it has the wrong feel. This particular sequel starts out like the latter, but works its way around to the first one...but in a good way. Frankly, the similarities pretty much save this from being a real stinker.
There are a few nitpicks; first movie featured one guy who had been a heavy metal rocker, a story line that is totally changed in this one, and there are several tunes in the first that are done again here. Also, the flashbacks to Donna's youth are so quickly intercut with Sophie's current day story that it gets confusing in places, especially for those of us old enough to vividly remember when Abba was THE pop band of the day.
Eventually, however, it found its groove and we warmed to it. There are even some really nice moments sprinkled here and there to help you hang on while it does so, which helps make up for approximately the same number of awkward and forced moments (such as Grandma's entrance). All in all, a nice date movie for the middle-aged, with some laughs and feels. It's overall above average, and because it picks up steam as it goes this will leave you thinking it's better than it is.",Mamma Mia! Here We Go Again

The relationship of Sophie and Donna is stronger than ever. The duet between Meryl and Amanda is incredible, very touching and probably you're going to cry a lot in that part.Cher singing ""Fernando"" is probably the best musical moment of the movie. I mean, Cher should be in every single movie in this world. All the cast are great but when the Goddess of Pop enter in the movie we just want to see more.Rosie and Tanya are funniest characters in the movie, the young and the oldest ones. And Tanya have the greatest lines on the movie.""Super Trouper"" is a duet with Cher and Meryl Streep with the backing vocals of all the cast. Seeing this two having a song together is like heaven on the earth.The Screenplay is not gold, but it's funny and entertainer. This is not a Oscar material movie but it is a movie to warm our hearts.",Mamma Mia! Here We Go Again
246,dickiepena,Extended Video or Movie?,1,28 October 2018,"The title, ""Mamma Mia, Here We Go Again,"" is deceptive.The happy ending from the first film is literally ripped away, like an old bandaid that takes a good chunk of flesh along with it, creating an unnecessary wound. Donna Sheridan, the beloved lead from the first film, played by the grand actress of our era, has been unceremoniously killed off.We are asked to believe Donna's best friends Tanya and Rosie had the same basic hairstyle their whole lives. I admit this is a petty critique, and that's how much I was disappointed in this bad idea that managed to get turned into a film.When we last saw the characters from the first film, they were filled with glee. Donna reunited with Sam, Sofie had three dads, Rosie started a romance, and everyone received their happily ever after.That is until this movie opens. In place of the charming fable, we are slapped with characters in the midst of grief, and they're scattered. They lament they can't be together for the grand reopening of Hotel Bella Donna for half the film. By mid film, everyone not on the island decides to show up.When the cast is finally reunited, there is Hope the mood will change, but the film delivers more musical numbers that are not nearly as dance inducing as those from the original. In fact, they were silly at best, and quite tragic considering the magic generated by the first film. Instead of utilizing ABBA songs that weren't in the first film, the most popular songs are reworked, and the results didn't make you want to get up and dance.The highlight of this film is Cher. Her plastic surgeon is brilliant. Many people who have undergone a facelift have telltale signs, such as that joker mouth, overfilled cheeks, or eyes that just aren't quite human. Instead, she is flawless. She is Cher. The script gives her very little, and she still turns her time on the screen as something special.When I heard Cher was in the film, my first thought was that her voice would be perfect for Fernando. The film makers agreed, and her voice is indeed perfect for Fernando.Looking glorious, Cher delivers a line about becoming a great grandmother that works because in real life she is an icon on so many levels, it's easy to forget she is mortal. Her ability to invoke dry humor is part of her genius as an entertainer.Unfortunately, Cher has so little screen time, it's not enough to save the film.We do get a visit from Meryl Streep, and I'm shocked she agreed to do the film, if she read the entire script. She does a sad song, that slaps viewers with the reality of our own mortality, and then the movie ends.While there are certainly films that serve different aspects of the human experience that are more difficult, it's not why people flocked to Mamma Mia on stage and movie theatres.The original is a multigenerational story that made us forget our woes, if just for a couple hours. It encouraged even the most inhibited among us to sing and dance.This film took it away, damaging the mythos created by the stage play and first film. You can never see Mamma Mia without knowing it's a lie. Donna doesn't get a happy ending. She dies.The makers of this film do not understand the music or the magic.",Mamma Mia! Here We Go Again

Instead, they received the flip side of a cover single from a 45 record. (Kids, your parents will tell you what that means)When producing musicals, to a general audience, they should be snappy, hip, fast-paced and fun. Look at Grease 2 for example enough. A sequel to a musical that fit all of the above. Mamma Mia!: Here We Go Again fell flat in everyone of those categories.Whether it be the scheduling of the main star or the writers of the screenplay, the fault lied there. The actors delivered. Best known from Cinderella or Baby Driver, Lilly James stole the show as Young Donna. Colin Firth showed his wide range of talents. Andy Garcia brought the style and sophistication from the Ocean's movies over to the Mamma Mia set. Stellen Skarsgard delivered. Even Cher proved she can turn back time. Sorry, bad joke and lots of cosmetic surgery (and it wasn't even sung on a naval ship!) But, the film did not work. Seeing it on FanGirl night made the extremely majority female audience want to sing along with the film, but they couldn't. Once again, because it was mostly the B-side selections from ABBA... which are mostly slower unrecognizable songs.Stick with what works. No one would care if they sang the same exact songs over again in this flash back / sequel.

The story has some more depth to it then the first. The first movie is more happy and more careless. Yet, this movie really touched me in multiple ways. 
Near the end I seriously had tears stream down my face and I really had to hold myself back from not bawling out loud. It took a while before those tears were gone. Gosh! But also at the beginning of the movie I had to fight multiple times to hold the tears back. Next time I will see this movie, I will probably just cry. When I'm alone at home. I will just ugly cry.

After the first 20 minutes or so of ""Here We Go Again"", I was very honestly, almost considering to leave the movie theater in disappointment. The 'new' cast who plays the younger version of Donna and the 3 men, who she romanced that summer on an island in Greece, looked the part well, but didn't play the part well. While their singing was more than adequate, their acting was sub-par and at times felt overdone and over the top in effort. And some of the scenes early in the movie felt cringingly cheesy and almost unnecessary, especially the scene with the poor Greek man on the boat who wanted to return to the island to.. (no spoilers) as well as the band whose singer was the son of the bar (restaurant?) owner. Fortunately though, the original (2008) cast kept my attention, and the flow of the movie improved about halfway in. There was certainly a great amount of attention and effort put into this movie's music production and choreography which I enjoyed the most. However, I'm not a big fan of Cher, and didn't really feel like she fit in/belong with the ensemble and the story, although it was a relatively short appearance.

Then, of course, Fernando, (only Cher is allowed to render that next to Frida), but for me the real surprise was the lovely arrangements (like Chiquitita, Hasta Manana and even Hole in Your Soul). All songs are featured very lovingly. I'm just glad that I was warned about the biggest spoiler, otherwise watching the film would have been a real bummer. Won't tell, just let me say that Meryl in My Love, My Life and Super Trouper is Abba-esque and a pity that the Day Before You Came is only on the album (wow to all who have a very different reading of its lyrics).

The acting is equal to before. The fun factor is the same if not a bit better. The wholesomeness was turned up a notch. Hollywood hates hearing that previous sentence. They hate values that aren't founded in self-destruction and egomania.I gave it a 7. The first movie I would rate 6.5 if that was an option.

Dont get me wrong. I still appriciate Lily and the new cast. They add to the movie a new breath of love and hope. I mean they are just too young for that big ABBA masterpieces.However, it's worth 10 years of waiting!",Mamma Mia! Here We Go Again

263,bilko-1,Tears Of Joy!,10,28 August 2018,"I was a late convert to the original and spent half the film bemoaning the poor direction and hammy acting, but then I got it. So bad, it was good! This was not a meaningful musical, but a throwback to the 30s when musicals were just some singing and dancing with a few gags thrown in for good measure. As hit after hit took hold, I warmed to the pure entertainment that was Mamma Mia.
Now, 10 years later, my expectations were not high. Sequels rarely live up to the original, the cast is full of youngsters old enough to be my grandchildren, and the songs were second grade Abba. But hold on! The songs were terrific, as were the kids, especially Lily James. The directing was far more inventive, the production design superb and right from the start we knew that none of this should be taken seriously, just enjoyed.
I cannot understand those who moan that the plot casts a dark shadow on the film and who feel shortchanged by the small amount of screen time for Meryl Streep. The story is nonsense folks! It's a vehicle for a load of great songs, funny gags, and outrageously over the top acting.
I was shedding tears of joy throughout. Admittedly, I club at anything, but I cried with happiness. Does that make me a softy, I guess so, but film critic Mark Kermode, the Horror expert, admitted the same emotions. I think that you have to be a real misery not to like this. There were times when the audience was laughing out loud and where I come from they were all coming out of the cinema with broad smiles on their faces. 
Can't wait to see it again!",Mamma Mia! Here We Go Again

Here We Go Again
266,Leopold005,"When All Is Said And Done, it's not as good as the first one",5,23 July 2018,"Immediate spoiler alert: Donna is dead!Not much of a spoiler, given that's the lynchpin of the entire movie, but it's important. However, what wasn't deemed quite so necessary was the how or why of it. I spent the entire movie wondering just what happened to her and, whilst it's probably of little consequence, it did affect my ability to give my entire focus.Anyway, she's dead and Sophie has taken the decision to get the hotel up and running in her honour. And in fairness to her, she's done more in the year since Donna's passing than Donna herself ever seemed to manage in the three decades (ish) that she was there. She's still a bit of a self-pitying brat, mind, sulking because her boyfriend Sky is over in New York, learning the hospitality trade and being offered a cushy job which he wants to take, and then getting monumentally upset at her failure to make the opening night of the hotel a success because of a force of nature that she couldn't possibly have done anything to prevent. Sometimes weather does that, Sophie, get over yourself!The whole movie is intertwined with vignettes from young Donna's life, starting with her graduation in 1979 and subsequently leaving to find the perfect place to be (and very fortunately dodging the Thatcher years in the process) where she meets Harry, Bill and Sam in the process for the ""dot dot dot"" encounters mentioned during the first movie, finding the place where she'll ultimately live the rest of her life and finally discovering she's pregnant. I quite liked how this was woven into the movie, rather than it being a straight prequel, but some of the elements didn't add up. Didn't she hook up with Bill before Sam in the original? And Harry was a virgin? Meh, I'm not convinced. Still, credit where it's due, the younger versions of Donna and the Diamonds were decent enough. Lily James, as young Donna, played the role very well. Jessica Keenan Wynn played young Tanya with all the character cues in place and was a brilliant likeness for Christine Baranski as well. I had to feel for Alexa Davies as Rosie, though, as she had the unenviable task of being Julie Walters, but she did nail the soft Brummie accent and personality traits. The three boys playing young Harry, Bill and Sam were all a bit cookie cutter, though, looking more like members of a popular boy band than youthful representations of the established roles.So far, so hit and miss. There's a selection of good Abba songs in there, some of which won't be as well known to some, but to others will definitely be recognisable (thanks, Dad!) But not many of them are very upbeat which, given the context of the movie's opening hammer blow, is probably to be expected. But then it took a notable turn for the worst when all the Deus Ex Machinas started crawling out of the woodwork. Bill and Harry, who had previously been noted as not being able to attend the grand opening, had a simultaneous rush of parental responsibility and ditched their ""unavoidable"" detentions to be there. Bill was getting some spurious award for being the best Swede (but for what?) by using his hitherto unmentioned twin brother as a stand-in, and Harry walked out of an important business meeting in true Mark D'Arcy style. Then they were able to rescue the party from being an unattended wash-out thanks to a chance encounter with a fisherman that Bill and Donna had previously helped back in the past, who explained that all the fishermen were basically not working - yep, every single one of them - so they were able to ferry over a sizeable party, including the previously unavaliable 2/3rds of Sophie's fathers. And then Cher turned up as Sophie's grandmother, to reveal that she was the reason that the hotel manager was so folorn, which was immediately turned around when she shouted his name, ""Fernando"". He was never called this in the film until this point and it felt like what it was; a cheap attempt to introduce an Abba song. Oh, and Sky decided that he didn't want his plum hospitality job in the Big Apple and came home. All's well that ends in a thick squirt of Hollywood style syrup. And if that wasn't enough, along came the huge dollop of whipped cream in the shape of a cameo by Meryl Streep, playing Donna's ghost, right at the end. So it's all good, I guess.There were a couple of other cameos, in the shape of Abba's boys. Bjorn was one of the professors in the opening young Donna scene, and Benny was playing the piano in the Parisian restaurant while Headbanger Harry sang the 1974 Eurovision winner in order to get Donna into bed. Which worked. But where were the girls? I suspect we can look forward to Agnetha and Frida appearing in the third movie, which given the current box office returns of this one, is probably already in the planning stages.Now I'm not going to sit here and tell you that the first one was a favourite, because it wasn't. Sure, it was an enjoyable enough romp, but it was a bit too sugary for my tastes. This one is in the same mould, only it's not quite as good in my view.Oh, and I also noticed that Christine Baranski was given top billing. Really? Tanya is a supporting character, so how did that happen? And yes, granted, nobody was technically the lead, but she appeared before Amanda Seyfried, Andy Garcia and Pierce Brosnan? Or even Colin Firth and Julie Walters? It would seem having a role on The Big Bang Theory carries more clout than I realised...",Mamma Mia! Here We Go Again

269,david-626-148063,Close to perfect,9,21 July 2018,"Before I saw the movie, I never thought I would write this: it is even better than the first Mamma Mia film!! I saw it on permiere night and was just amazed how good it is. It is more melancholic than the first one, but that really suits the film since it copes with even more relational issues than the first one. Never in-depth, of course, it is a musical, but I was so touched by many scenes. See also below. Firstly, I must say that the music, in terms of the songs chosen, fits perfectly with the film and the action. I have been an Abba-fan for almost all my life, but I must say I am amazed to find out, again and again, how brilliant their texts are and how the creators have suited them to the film and the progression within. When they are not singing, you have other songs that run in the background, also partly with some local complexion (Abba a la Greek), that are not included on the movie soundtrack. So be prepared to listen to even more Abba music. Secondly, the coreography is brilliant and very inventive/creative. Some of the dance scenes really blew my mind, especially Dancing Queen, When I Kissed the Teacher and - surprisingly enough, since this is far from being my favourite song - Waterloo. Chapeau to director, producers and cast - so enjoyable!!Thirdly - speaking about cast - Lily James as young Donna is a bull's eye casting. She really comes through the screen! She is so radiant; you will just love her! She does great dancing, and her singing is also more than approved. Speaking about singing, also Amanda Seyfried has a beautiful voice that fits her song appearances perfectly during the film. I so love to watch her in Mamma Mia. Meryl Streep, but that goes without saying, also has a magnificent voice.Fourthly, the production is so seamless, switching between the different time periods within tenths of a second and then back again. This is done so well and produced perfectly; I would even say it cannot be done more brillantly. Well, well done to the creators. So why don't I give top score, but ""only"" 9 stars? The only thing that I thought wasn't perfect, was that especially in the first part of the movie, some scenes are shot where it seemed to me that the actors weren't quite there, meaning I wished more presence and intensity in the scenes. But that is really the only minor negative thing with this in all other aspects perfect movie. I really loved it, especially Lily James and Amanda Seyfried, but also the young characters (Harry, Bill, Sam, Rosie and Tanya) are very well casted (esp. the latter two). Skarsgård, Brosnan and Firth also perform very well, and be well seated and prepared for a short, but intense performance of Cher. As Waterloo, Fernando has also never been a top favourite of mine, but Fernando in the movie is so well done. So be prepared to be entertained and moved. Tears were pressing through during many scenes. Have your Cleenex ready esp. during My Love, My Life. Have there ever been shot a more perfect scene in a musical? I don't think so. Also I've Been Waiting For You movied me to the edge; far from being the most well-known Abba song, but in the film it really breaks through. Thanks to all involved in the making for giving us this magnificent piece of movie and music entertainment! Eternally grateful!",Mamma Mia! Here We Go Again

She lands up pregnant on a greek island and gets taken in by a kindly woman who lets her live rent-free in a run-down house that, over the years, she turns into a hotel.
Fast forward 25 years and she's popped her clogs leaving her daughter to run the hotel. A grand re-opening is spoiled by a storm but with the help of the three men she calls ""father"", her mother's old school chums, several boat loads of greek extras, Andy Garcia and Cher (playing the grandmother) it all turns out for the best.
The film only really comes alive with the arrival of Cher, but as this only happens in the last 20 minutes it's a long slog. Most of the good songs must have been used up in the first film (I really can't remember) because there's quite a few I've never heard before.

Lily James is phenomenal in her role as Young Donna--without her performance and Meryl's too-brief cameo, I'd have given this disaster a single star--but she just doesn't yet have the gravitas to carry the entire film.

Only some scenes with Cher and Andy Garcia are really entertaining and funny. Furthermore, most of ABBA songs used in the movie are rather unknown and there are only a few greatest hits.

295,geode,"Frothy, bubbly, and fun...",8,16 August 2018,"I had been hoping that this sequel would give Pierce Brosnan a chance to sing again. I was not disappointed, he does a nice rendition of part of ""SOS""...a decade ago I was the only one I knew to defend Pierce's singing in the first movie, but his version of the same song is much better ten years later.It is rare that a sequel lives up to an original movie, and even rarer that a sequel is actually better. This is superior in just about every way. Yes, I guess now that the term ""prequel"" is in common use, this movie is both a ""sequel"" and a ""prequel"" at the same time. The director seems to have taken a leaf out of the philosophy of the principal character, Donna, and ""thrown caution to the wind"" allowing the whole thing to romp with exuberance that borders on becoming silly or a parody, but he keeps a firm hand guiding it so it never crosses that line. Instead it stays frothy, bubbly and fun. The ""over the top"" approach can be richly entertaining if it is defty held in control. Think of Johnny Depp in ""Pirates of the Caribbean"" or John Wayne in ""True Grit"" ...this works here. Not only is the direction vastly superior to the first movie, so is the editing. This shows up splendidly in song sequences, with ""One of Us"" as a duet early in the film being a stunning standout. This is one of the lesser known gems in the ABBA song catalog.It is better scripted than the original, with the songs integrated better with the plot. It seemed far less forced. OK, the ""Waterloo"" scene is a definite stretch, but once again the over the top approach to the number is enjoyable and entertaining. Having Richard Curtis onboard must have helped quite a bit, he is a master with comedic material that still has bite.I knew that Meryl Streep was billed in the cast as well as Cher, and Cher appeared in the trailer, but as the movie neared its end neither had appeared. It was worth the wait. Cher does an excellent cover of ""Fernando"" with Andy Garcia, and Meryl a poignant duet with Amanda Seyfried, mother and daughter reaching the end of plot arcs that have paralled each other. Meryl's performance in the first movie was the only one she ever rendered with which I was disappointed, but she nails it here. I think the director of the first movie is at least partly responsible for the results on screen that didn't impress me. Phyllida Lloyd may have done a fine job with the stage production, but I didn't think she understood film very well.Lily James has the largest part, and has a pleasing voice. If I have any critical comment about her it might be that she is a little too pretty to play the younger version of Meryl Streep's character Donna.There is a beautifully large production number of ""Super Trooper"" under the credits at the end and there is a funny post-credits scene that virtually everyone in the audience saw, which is unusual. It takes skill to hold an audience to that point, especially these days.This is what a musical is supposed to be like, something to lift the spirits.About the only negative for me was not giving Christine Baranski a solo. I thought her scene with one in the first film was the best in that movie. I also would have let Pierce finish his song, he was doing just fine with it.I have not yet read a word about this in reviews. I know people that tend to adore the first movie, and it will be interesting to hear what they think about it in a comparison. I can't be this wrong. There must be critics that also think this is an improvement on the first movie. But I have to admit that although I had expected to like the original, I was very disppointed in it as it did not meet expectations. This sequel exceeded them.I recommend this one for those who like musicals. For those that do not like musicals this will probably not be your cup of tea and will seem mindlessly silly.If you see it keep an eye out for Benny and Björn, the two male members of ABBA. They both have very quick cameos.",Mamma Mia! Here We Go Again

303,elinkate,Traumatic,2,5 April 2020,Ok so Lily James is perfect in it. It's a beautiful film with the location and the Baranski/Walters combo but oh my god what a load of depressing drivel. There's absolutely no need for Donna's death and that horrid Christening scene traumatised me for life. It's SO SAD. Donna should've been written as a woman who flew off to some other country to live with her love and was well and good and came back for the Christening perhaps but no they went and killed her off and made everyone sad. Never felt so depressed after leaving the cinema. 7/10 for cast. 1/10 for story and -50/10 for the feel good factor it's supposed to have like the first. Yikes,Mamma Mia! Here We Go Again

My beloved actually gave it five out of five! 5/5!I'm a bit more reserved and give it nine out of ten 9/10! We both love musicals and are both sentimental old saps! We were both touched by the film!It's a not much of a story/plot!But the music and performances are excellent 
I was especially impressed with Cher! Damn - she can sing - and the ""diva presence""!
One of my favourite actors/actresses are Julie Walters! But after having seen Julie Walters in - ""Personal Services (1987)"" - whenever I see her I can't help but think - ""Popozogolou"" and Christine Baransky will always be Maryann from ""Cybill (1995)""!

I think when everyone heard this movie would be coming the expectations were high , after how successful Mamma Mia was , they couldn't make a bad movie that would permanently tarnish the legacy of the first movie , and they certainly didn't. I have no laughed out loud in a cinema that much in God knows how long. Julie Walters , Christine Baranski and Colin Firth I think deserve special mentions for bringing humor to the movie , Lily James as young Donna was fantastic. 
The music , the music was beyond incredible. They had big shoes to fill from Mamma Mia , and they met and exceeded all expectations. Even not knowing some of the ABBA songs , you could still bob your head along and enjoy it just as much as any well known song. I loved that it was lesser known ABBA songs but also still some songs from the first movie were included , but sung by different people of more people or just in a different way. 
So overall I would give this movie a solid 10/10 it was just so entertaining from ""when I kissed the teacher "" right the way up to ""Super Trooper"" and I would highly recommend it to anyone looking to just laugh for 2 hours.",Mamma Mia! Here We Go Again

I was happily wrong, because this has charm, an excellent script, awesome scenery, and good acting, including an outstanding performance ( singing and acting) by Lily James ( she will go far). The opening scene where a younger Donna is addressing her senior class gets you immediately into the mood. Yes, I choked up a few times, laughed out load, cheered and also greatly enjoyed Cher's appearance. Forget La La Land; this is far better. I predict it will be nominated for the following Oscars, at a minimum: Best Original Script, Best Costumes, Best Cinematography, Best Film Editing, Best Actress (or Supporting depending how it's defined) for Lily James.

Sequels are rarely better than the first movie so expectations were low but it was actually better that I could have hoped. The numbers were given new life and instead of being a run of the mill sequel, at some points it felt like it was more reminiscing.
 But Cher ruined it. She didn't belong in it and tbh her character was an anoying b*tch. But she was only in the last few minutes so who cares?
 It was meant to be a bit of fun and I know Donna was MIA through most of the movie but she does reappear near the end which isn't too bad. And it's nice that Donna isn't in it in a weird way. It allows the plot to move on and if we were reminiscing on an alive main character's live while she's still alive and kicking seems kinda shallow and vain. The second movie doesn't have the shock factors that the first had but I kinda grew up watching it on repeat. We all miss Donna and it felt missing but the guys were still there and we did see young Donna. 
The plot doesn't match up like the order of the guys and such but They're all unreliable narrators anyways so she could have changed things in the diary to look less bad (like more of a rebound spree and less of a sl*tty move) and she could have played up the guys to make them Look better. And Sophie could have lied to her friends in the first movie to protect her mum. Make it look more rebounding like she was so lost after loosing Sam. I'm just saying that in the first movie the narrator is unreliable.",Mamma Mia! Here We Go Again

The story line is wonderful and the acting is phenomenal. The scene where Sophie was bringing down her infant child to be christened, and she saw her deceased mum smiling. That made me want to cry.

I was transported back to Kalokari, surrounded by all the fictional characters and lovely fictional situations that were clever continuations from the first movie. I was also disappointed that Donna wasn't present and actually rebelled at first to the tears that came when she did appear (appropriately) at the climax of the film. Exquisite emotions from beginning to end. Jump in and just go for it, this film will not disappoint if you are looking for what it offers (and it does deliver exactly what it promised!): entertainment, pure and simple with escapism to a Greek paradise where all our original (and a few new) characters continue to live their movie-tale lives!

I didn't think I would end up seeing this film, until my family bought a ticket for me, and blindly accepted without thinking of the repercussions of what the experience would bring. But it ended up just taking my time, because the film was mostly irritable and empty in substance. The movie was so laughable and boring that my mind began to wonder by the end scene; like, how is Cher is only three years older than Merly Streep and yet she is supposed to be her mother? I understand Mamma Mia! thrives on being cheesy escapism but there has to be a point where its just has nothing else to offer but the nostalgia of the first film (Which I didn't particularly like either). Merly Streep had no reason to be dead other than the fact that she probably knew this movie was going to be a huge disaster and wanted to be involved as little as possible. The songs in this film were passable, but not memorable, unlike the first film- which I believe was the only redeeming quality of the first one. None of the acting was mentionable either. If I were to describe this film in one word, it would either be nonsense or bland. Or bland nonsense in two. This movie came to a GRINDING halt every time it would cut back to present day, which makes me think if they should have just ditched those scenes all-together and made a full prequel film. Yet another example of a studio trying to cash in on its properties without putting any thought into the actual product.Pros:
-Some of the songs were nice?
Cons:
-Unfocused 
-Boring and poorly paced 
-Cher was in it
-The present day scenes were awful",Mamma Mia! Here We Go Again

Lily James is a delight as the youthful, adventurous Donna, and Amanda Seyfried matures convincingly into the owner of the remodeled Hotel Bella Donna.

339,ssharon-17215,Good music & dancing but disappointing story,5,25 July 2018,"While I absolutely loved the play, 10 years ago, and the first movie was enjoyable, this sequel's story just didn't make any sense. The music, singing, and acting were all fine as well as set, scenery & costumes. However, I left the theatre feeling empty and sad. No one in the audience seemed to enjoy it (no laughing, crying, singing or humming). When I watched the first movie, I could believe the story somewhat as I've met women who were not sure who their baby's dad was. It had happened 25 years previously and Donna's wild past was all water under the bridge. In this movie, we see it all happening in real time. The British guy knew her less than a day, the Swedish boat guy for two days, and the American architect for a week. But all these men are so infatuated with her that they never get married and have kids of their own. As far as we know, they've never had any stable relationships. Moreover, they all grieve Donna's passing (they barely knew her) and drop everything to be with their one-third daughter. It seemed that after meeting young Donna, no other woman could match her in the eyes of these men. How sad.The two girlfriends fare no better. Young Donna is the Greek goddess Aphrodite incarnate. Absolutely gorgeous, sweet, and talented, with exquisite breasts and flat belly which she never fails to show off (and why not?). Standing next to her, the two other young women don't stand a chance. When we see the older versions, neither of them have learned anything or grown up. Baranski's character still views men as mere objects (one is expected to mature as one ages) and has divorced 4 times; Waters' character still consoles herself with cake and sleeps with a man who had cheated on her. Neither of the two women has had stable relationships (as far as we know) or children. It seems that hanging around with Donna has ruined their lives somehow. They didn't strike me as happy, fulfilled women.Okay, so young Donna was a bit wild. We've all been there, done that. But don't pretend to be innocent. The first morning with the American guy, young Donna tells him ""I've never done that before"" (I don't know what you think of me). Come on. We've just seen you sleep with 3 guys in a week. Bar lady lets young Donna stay in the ruined hotel for free if she fixes it up. Well, either young Donna is rich enough to pay the tradesmen, or she does all the work herself. Or maybe she uses the technique that worked when she missed the ferry: get a guy to help you. Young Donna has fabulous looks and a tremendous skill set. She can easily get anyone to like her, can turn a derelict building until a successful hotel, she can take care of horses & donkeys, she can sing & dance, all the while she raising a child on her own. Donna is so perfect and talented that she doesn't seem human but some kind of goddess. To reinforce her supernatural aspects, she reappears as a singing ghost at the end!Right from the start (young Donna not only graduating from Oxford but she is valedictorian), with the convocation ceremony breaking out into a fun dance, we see the movie is a fantasy. But I just find it unbelievable that such an incredibly beautiful, sweet, talented girl never got married. I get that the movie wanted to show that being a parent is a wonderful experience. Too bad the 3 men and 2 girlfriends couldn't experience that for themselves, too; rather, they seem to live through Donna.I recommend watching this film on TV if you want mindless entertainment. Just don't think too much.",Mamma Mia! Here We Go Again

The only thing this movie did for me is make me want to watch the original Mamma Mia with Meryl Streep who is absolutely amazing.

And frankly I didn't buy the younger Donna, it didn't seem the person she was, too frivolous. There was a major disconnect, the music didn't have the charm of the first.

The look on his face was teeth-grinding humiliation.It was then I realized the positively evil nature of this industry.  I watched this travesty with a friend who was in the entertainment industry a while back . we saw it and I highly populated area outside Chicago where approximately 35 people were in attendance on a Friday night at the 7:20 show (8/10/18). 3 people walked out around the 40 min pt. A man was snoring loudly a few rows behind. The casting couch must have gotten an Olympic workout to have cast the two main stars Olivia Stone and someother blond- neither could sing...AT ALL. Nor could they dance. If fact I don't believe a true choreographer was hired. The younger men seemed overtly gay. Not one laugh was elicited by the sudience intentionally- Cher's last wig did the trick. Truly revolting - dare I say nearly sub- human script writing - I'm sure the late Koco the gorilla could have provided better dialogue thru sign language. One truly has to wonder if there is an agenda here- because we both complained about literal pain! It's bad enough to be cringe worthy, but the profound idiocy of the script, - in fact, the entire Concept ( that's a shout out to you Judy Craymer!$ ) it borders on nefarious.Has the industry, now tired of demeaning actors and audiences moved in to diabolic acts of cognitive assault?Or has the disconnect grown so cavernous the industry can no longer relate to the emotionally mature and intellectually sound?Strange days indeed.

357,Film_Buff_Dennis_Dolan,A Pleasant Surprise,7,22 July 2018,"Personally, I'm not a fan of the first Mamma Mia. The first film, I felt, good aspects but that the bad outweighed the good. I thought that the focus should have been on Sophie (Amanda Seyfried) trying to figure out who her father was, Sam (Pierce Brosnan), Harry (Colin Firth) and Bill (Stellan Skarsgard) and was instead put on one too many Abba songs and objectively bad comedy. On top of that, I felt that most of the characters were ether unnecessary or didn't get nearly enough focus as they should.So, given my opinion on the original, one would think that I would feel the same about the new one. But that not the case...It's not an award winning film or a clever social commentary or anything like that. However, it is significantly better than the first one. It does what many sequels don't do but most sequels should do. It takes the bad aspects of the first one and tries to change them around to make them work and also finding the good aspects and improving them as well as making them more prominent. In this movie, even though it was stellar, was done much better. I felt that the movie had a little too much of Meryl Streep in it. In this movie, Meryl's character is still a large aspect of it, but Meryl herself is barely in it. On top of it, The filmmakers choose have young Donna be played by Lily James. An actress who's not as good of an actress as Meryl Streep, but is a significantly better singer.Another thing that I didn't like was Donna's friend group, Rosie (Julie Walters) and Tanya (Christine Baranski). In the first film, I felt that the two of them were incredibly intrusive. However, in this movie, even though they still have a large part, they are much less intrusive and much funnier in their young roles with young Rosie (Alexia Davies) and young Tanya (Jessica Keenan Wynn). Another thing was that I didn't like how some characters weren't given enough focus when they really should have. In this movie, he still wasn't that prominent part in this one, I knew that Sophie's husband's name was Sky (Dominic Cooper). Amongst other things, the cinematography, the acting, the emotional moments and the color palette were all improved.Too top it all off, this movie is everything a sequel should be. It improves on aspects that were bad and made the good aspects more prominent. It was better than I ever expected I would definitely recommend it.",Mamma Mia! Here We Go Again

366,dgilleand,Lazy and kind of pointless.,5,13 October 2018,"There's not a lot of musicals that have sequels, and maybe there's a good reason for that. There was one musical I wanted a sequel to, and that was Across the Universe. Well, Mamma Mia borrows from the same concept of using an artist's discography as their soundtrack, so maybe this could be a good thing? Potentially, but that potential is ruined. ABBA didn't have as many hits as The Beatles, so the sequel had to reuse some of the most popular songs from the first film, which no sequel, musical or not, should ever do. It shows a lack of creativity and feels like a cop-out. The unused music it does have feels like the rejected songs the first couldn't or wouldn't fit in. The story itself is nonexistent. There is no real reason to have the flashbacks, and the actors portraying the characters don't look much like their counterparts. With respect to Donna's besties, those were spot on. Let's face it, though. This takes place in 1979, and Meryl Streep still looked and sounded like Meryl Streep in 1979. She's a legend. Anyone trying to copy her will at most look like a cosplayer. It's just not wise to try. Besides, like I said, the flashbacks don't tell us anything new, not really, they were just a conduit to introduce more songs.It was okay, but it's not worth a second viewing",Mamma Mia!

The original is so wonderful that I watch it a minimum of once a month. Yes, every month! I was so sadly disappointed with this movie! About the only thing I can say good about it is Cher and Andy Garcia. Killing off Donna was a sad mistake. I read why the new screen writer did it and it was a poor decision that affected the whole tone of the movie. It felt like a funeral pyre where everyone was tossing their memories onto her burning body. Lily James did not connect with Donna's spirit at all. Yes, I got that she was showing Donna's free-spirited youth, but I understood that about Donna in the original. The editing lacked skill as well with the scenes from the past and future clashing with each other rather than flowing. The scene with Sam leaving lacked any real drama and was followed by scenes that seeped any more out of the leaving. Everyone in here felt like a supporting player to the missing Donna and no one broke out to be there for themselves except Cher. Even there, her scenes with Sophie deserved more from the writer. We know that she shunned Donna when she found out she was pregnant and was absent Sophie's whole life. Come on! This deserved much more! Cher's duet with Andy was more emotional than her scenes with Amanda!Lastly, the songs. They all felt like they were stuck into the story with a crowbar wielded by a very heavy hand. Almost all were lesser-known songs and rarely fit the scene they were in. Most lacked the exuberance of the songs in the original and, as with the story, felt more like a funeral dirge.",Mamma Mia!

And that the romances were not in sync with the 1st movie story line? That the production didn't even bother having actors wear contacs as their eyes' colors did not match. The plot is so poor and the characters lost their charm and any credibility..... they are so shallow that ""the dead"" grandmother reappeared over 20 years later, apparently didn't even show up at her daughter's funeral, and all is good and forgotten? As an ABBA, and the 1st movie fan, I felt cheated and treated like I was brainless......

The returning cast was great. Amanda Seyfried was especially good. The two sidekicks were very good, too. Cher made the whole movie worth it. I upped the rating two stars just because she was so mesmerizing.Lily James got on my nerves. She overacted. She seems like she is a theater actress with a very broad style. She could have been great if the director reeled her in a bit. The two younger sidekick counterparts were brilliantly cast, though.The production was beautifully shot and choreographed. The arrival of the guests singing Dancing Queen was especially spectacular. The baptism scene with Meryl at the end was very moving and worked well. Cher singing Fernando was phenomenal, though it was such a stretch making it fit into the movie's paper thin plot.If it had a good book and Lily James calmed down a bit, I would have loved it.

383,Lt_Columbo_007,A blissful absence of Pierce Brosnan solos and a knockout performance from Lily James makes 'Mamma Mia 2' better than it has any right to be,7,23 April 2019,"Ah, musicals. The very moment the prolific word filters into the air, the reverberating shivers shoot down paternal spines, prompting an inexplicable onset of influenza and, of course, a 'splitting headache' for good measure. Both of which are inevitably forgotten by the time the ending credits have begun to roll, courtesy of the dogged wife determinedly dragging you along to CineWorld anyway. At least the Maltesers were alright.To call Mamma Mia 2 a 'cash cow' is to bestow a great disservice upon our four-legged friends. With each regurgitated melody of Abba's radio-repeated hits, you can practically see the jingle of the money hat. It's effectively mainstream busking. And yet, unfathomably, it works.There are two reasons for this, in my professional and, simultaneously, completely irrelevant opinion. Firstly, God has finally heard the decade-long prayers of Abba fanatics worldwide, and succumbed to their requests to edit the movie script overnight, removing any Pierce Brosnan solo's (His Halloween-inspired rendition of 'SOS' from the original film will no doubt be the accompanying soundtrack if one is unfortunate enough to be admitted to hell).Secondly, the addition of Lily James to this franchise has boosted it's status from a 'forced feel-good film' to a genuine feel-good film. For one, she can actually sing. Secondly, she can dance. Thirdly, she can act. That immediately isolates her from over half of the actors in this film. Musicals are definitely her forte, even those surly (and, let's face it, burly) husbands won't be able to resist a begrudging grin at her infectious positivity.Of course, the locations don't hurt. Neither does an all-star cast and a musical recipe book that everyone's already familiar with. It does take a while to get going, but stick with it, you won't regret it.

385,kriegerg69,Utterly dreadful,1,26 September 2018,"Meryl Streep reportedly didn't want to do a full role, so she only appears for a few minutes near the end of the movie. They basically explain that Donna has died...without Streep, this film never should have been made. It even has a very downbeat, lackluster opening instead of the dynamics the first film had in its opening...and that was a bad sign to start off with.
Technically, it's very well photographed (albeit much darker-looking than the first film) and technically accomplished, but that's not enough. Musically...they used all the good and well-known songs in the first movie, so this one uses much lesser ABBA tunes, and unfortunately reuses several songs from the first film...that gets very tiresome very quickly because the viewer (at least I did) wants to hear songs not used the first time around. The only two standouts were ""Knowing Me, Knowing You"" and the song ""Waterloo"" (only heard and performed during the first film's end credits) but redone here as a big production number. Half the movie is spent on flashback scenes to Donna's past using younger actors as the characters.
There was also absolutely no need for Cher to be in the film, as she adds nothing...nada...zero...to the story...only reason is so her character can sing the song ""Fernando"" (not used the first time around). She's accompanied by Andy Garcia, whose only reason for being there is he plays Fernando, giving a very weak reason for Cher's character to sing to (and with) him, and there's no reason for his character to be there either.
There's also really weak reasoning for Rosie and Bill's breakup to be part of the story, rather odd considering they got together near the end of Mamma Mia. Most annoying was how there was no mention at all of Harry Bright's (Colin) sexuality...in Mamma Mia, it turns out he's gay and ends up with a handsome boyfriend, but that gets thrown right out the window with no mention of his being gay or what happened to his partner from the first film (except for some brief hinting at in the flashbacks with the younger Harry).

This really upset me because Donna made the entire first movie. And they didn't even bother to mention how she died. Next, we get to the flashback scenes of young Donna. This I love because the fashion is beautiful and Lily James is wonderful and has a good singing voice. I really like how she sang the original songs but the newer songs were just meh (I don't see people getting into them). At first it doesn't really make sense how she meets the three dads because during the flashback in the previous movie they look way different. The current time scenes were pretty boring and just revolves around everyone being depressed about Donna. They could have done so much more if they had kept her alive. The movie overall lacked much of a plot or direction and you knew exactly what was going to happen (other than maybe Cher arriving on a helicopter?).

Lily James is a fun turn as Donna, and she captures the idealism of a woman who hasn't become more cynical with time. And there are some nice musical numbers, but unfortunately, there's not enough charm nor story to put it on the same level.
I think part of the issue is that Mamma Mia was originally a musical where the writers took time to develop the story and choose the ABBA songs that fit. The same could have been done for this, but six out of the eighteen songs had been used in the first film, and one of the new songs seemed like it was simply chosen so they could get Cher to sing it.

399,emilytzotza,A real disappointment..,4,31 July 2018,"So.. I don't know what to say, I never believed this film could be such a failure... I'm still trying to understand the reason they even bothered to make it.. I rated it with a 4 just for sentimental reasons because i love the actors and the first mama mia is my favourite musical ever.. (the real rating is below 1). but let's say a few things..
There were too many plot holes.. it was like the directors hadn't seen the first movie. Donna met the 3 guys in a completely different order and I'm pretty sure her mother was dead (but even if i'm wrong, the first film didn't left me with the impression that she was a big cinema, or whatever, star). Except for these, even though the idea of showing us donna's past was really good, the directors and screenplay writers didn't make a good use of it. They barely showed us what had happened back then and there was no character or plot evolution. I was sitting at the cinema chair waiting for something to happen but... the whole film atmosphere was so sad and melancholic.. at first I thought that that was the point but now i'm not sure.. maybe it was sad because of being so bad.. it was a pity because Lily james was amazing! However, actors can't save a whole movie.. 
I can continue but it will just make me sadder..
I would recommend you not to waste any time for this movie but I know this is impossible for mama mia fans. So go watch it and then come back here so that we can cry all together.

401,Kira_bella,"I was definitely cheated by you, Mamma Mia 2",3,20 July 2018,"So... I went into this movie LOVING the first one and happy they were making a second. I left the movie ... um... empty? Okay, I love the idea of them going back to when Donna was first pregnant with Sophie and her journey, however... like none of the events actually added up to the story of how it all happened in Mamma Mia when Sophie found her diary. Literally none of it.. at all. Also WHY WAS CHER EVEN IN THIS MOVIE?!?!! Her character did NOTHING to the plot and it just was kind of stupid the movie would have been better without her since, again IN THE FIRST FILM (did you guys just not go back to the first script before planning this?) her mom was presumably DEAD (cut to the scene after Donna and them sing Super Trooper and are in her room and Donna says ""somebody up there has it in for me, I bet its my mother"" ... POINTING TO THE CEILING LIKE HER MOM WAS DEAD). I just am disappointed. I feel like Cher was just in there to sing Fernando cause that's...all she did. I loved who played young Donna, Lily James, though she was sweet. I don't know, this movie just didn't have the same feel as the first one. Although, I did cry in the end and I know I wasn't the only one that did cause I heard the sniffles in the theater xD that last scene was very touching. But um .... that's about all I got. Loved the original cast and the young cast (although it would've been HILARIOUS if the guys dressed like in the first movie when Donna had flashbacks of them hahaha). The songs are decent, also the replays of the classic hits were great. It was just ... kinda there. Probably won't see it again, I'll stick with the first movie.Also, these are JUST MY OPINIONS, if you see it differently awesome I'm so happy for you, I just feel like... they had a chance and they missed the shot. It wasn't a complete miss in my opinion, the story of how Donna met the guys and how it all happened just didn't really add up to how it was told originally and that kind of bugged me. I get they were going completely back and creating a whole new story, however, they made an ""outline"" of how she met them all when Amanda sung Honey, Honey ... so ... and I just again don't get why Cher was even in this. It just made zero sense. If she wasn't in the movie it'd be 5 minutes shorter, that's it. Maybe I'll see it again once it comes out to video and watch them back to back and have a different reaction, but until then ... I'm empty.",Mamma Mia! Here We Go Again

Did it spoil the whole film for me no!This is a great movie, the young cast compliment the original perfectly, and Lily James is a star.This is a great feel good movie which also has the power to move you in places too. Okay so the chronology was messed with, they didn't plan this as a trilogy or Marvel like series of films from the start, so they had to ... adapt things.Just sit back relax and enjoy great music, excellently staged and performed.

It was my first proper favourite movie, and literally opened my eyes when it came to musicals. Even as a male, I absolutely loved the first movie and I watched it so many times it felt like the cast were my family. Seeing this in cinema at age 16 (with my grandmother again) was very nostalgic and emotional. It made me laugh, cry, dance, and cry my eyes out. I've spent 10 years learning to love musicals and theatre and movies and it eventually brought me back to this. The story was amazing, the young actors (Lily James in particular) were phenomenal, the legacy cast were as amazing as they were before and although I missed her a lot, Meryl's entrance made me bawl. The acting was spectacular, the singing was bliss and the setting was great. I've seen this movie 3 times and I am planning a 4th, no regrets. This movie and it's predecessor changed my life and I'm proud to call them my favourite films. Well done to ABBA, the writers, director, producers and cast. Absolutely spectacular. Seriously- go see this movie.",Mamma Mia! Here We Go Again

414,eleanorlilydavis,Why why did they make another one,1,13 August 2018,"If your looking for a movie full of gut wrenching cringe, terrible accents and pointless plot devices then look no further. Why why did they make another one.A copy of the classic, this film attempts to render the story by copying the exact plot just with the cast being 10 years older. The addition of stars such as Andy Garcia conveniently named fernando proves the point that they are trying to shove as many Abba songs as they can down our throats. The lack of emotion by cast members and particularly poor acting by Harrys unidentical past self portrayed by Hugh Skinner with his nauseating performance left me in an unbearable state of cringe. 
The only positive spin i can take from this is the performance by Lily James playing the beloved Donna. Yet why does she leave her friends constantly for a romantic get away. Sophie seems to of lost contact with her friends from the first film and only has time to discuss relationships and the constant down falls at the new and improved hotel. What ever happened to female friendships.
Trying it's worst to target a range of age groups. It attempts to cover all areas. Cher for the oldies (bearing in mind that she would of had donna when she was 3) and the fresh male meat taking they're tops of at any chance 
to attract the youth.
Why did Donna have to die? this could be seen as a ploy to get our sympathy yet we know nothing of how she died. Is Meryl Streep really too stuck up to do Mamma Mia 2. She only gave them 20 seconds of her time.
I wouldn't waste your time on this cringy, exaggerated sequel when the first film was a classic.

This movie could be the best summer movie of 2018, but then again something went off. Let's start with the first sequel, Mamma Mia! 
I did completely enjoy the first sequel. My God, Streep definitely should be at the second sequel, but sadly she doesn't do sequel. That's the problem. That's the point. Im not going to say that the movie is extremely depressing and ugly because Streep isn't in the movie, but it does indeed something is off and empty like a big hole in the sea and that hole should be filled by Streep performance. But at the other side of the story, Lily James performance as young Donna definitely stole the show. She captured Donna perfectly, although only Streep could capture Donna better than Donna herself. The flashback isn't that bad even though the timeline is a mess. The present scene? just like i said, it's empty like there's a big hole in the sea. 
Now, let's talk about Cher appearance. Completely useless and has no point. I'm so sorry Cher, you did good but not this one. Maybe this is the way out for the producer to filled the big hole in the sea, by filling it out with Cher appearance, but no, sorry the hole still empty.",Mamma Mia! Here We Go Again

It is also very emotional. Although it I still very good, it does go against the original ""Mamma Mia!"" timeline. For example, at the beginning of ""Mamma Mia!"" we see Sophie say that her mother met the 3 possible fathers in the order: Sam, Bill and then Harry. However, in this one, we see Donna meet Harry, Bill and then Sam. But this is only a small problem. It follows the story of Sophie trying to re-do her mothers old hotel after she died. While this is happening, we see a younger version of Donna meeting all 3 of Sophie's possible fathers. Lily James plays young Meryl Streep perfectly and has tyre voice of an angel. Amanda Seyfried is able to portray Sophie in an amazingly believeable way. And Cher is a hilarious (great) grandmother. It is packed full of musical numbers.

Who else could take the reigns from Meryl Streep? The scenes that took place in the present were also well developed and interesting. I thought the way the movie switched back and forth between the stories of young Donna, and then that of present day Sophie was interesting. The entire movie was also very ascetically pleasing and just pretty to look at. Obviously, there wasn't a single song that wasn't a bop.

442,sdrosario1,Young Bill and Young Donna Stole the Show!,9,25 July 2018,"Like the first film, this movie carries with it such a warm, family-friendly, good feel and fun vibe, you'll really leave the theatre planning to see it again while you hum the songs on your way home. Lily James is phenomenal as a young Donna, and I don't even use the word phenomenal I had to google to double check the spelling, but that's just how much she jumped off the screen. One surprise that stole every scene he was in was Josh Dylan who played a young Bill. He had -hands down- the best chemistry with Lily and therefore was the most enjoyable to watch compared to young Harry (Hugh Skinner) and young Sam (Jeremy Irvine) who both fell a little flat in their parts. The actress playing Young Tanya (Jessica Keenan Wynn) will leave your jaw dropped because that was such perfect casting. Seriously, was that Christine Baranski's daughter playing dress up or something? She had the lines, the attitude, the facial expressions all down to a tee. The musical numbers were much more choreographed and fun and bigger budget in comparison with the first film. They brought back the big hits (""Mamma Mia"" , ""Dancing Queen"") and did them justice while bringing in some otherwise lesser-known ABBA hits (""One of Us""; ""Knowing Me, Knowing You""; ""Angel Eyes"" for example). The story is not at all complicated and is actually very short but because the film goes back and forth between young Donna on her quest to find herself and current Sophie finding a way to feel closer to her mom, it feels more weighted. The emotion between the family in present time as they grapple with loss and moving on, the nostalgia with nods to the first film intermingled with the same subtle humor, the performances from Amanda Seyfried, Lily James,Pierce Brosnan, Meryl Streep, all of this grounded the movie in such a way you'll sit in your seat and smile to yourself and feel as though they're also your family and why haven't you listened to any ABBA music lately?In the grand scheme of things, movies are about escapism. We all want to forget some things, even if just for a few hours. This is that kind of movie. It'll make you smile and just for that little bit, everything will be okay. Be prepared to cry, laugh and sing along with this fantastic sequel to Mamma Mia, you won't regret it.",Mamma Mia! Here We Go Again

Throughout the movie you go through all the emotions yet once it had finished you just want to sit there and wish you could do it all again 
The whole cast looked like they had as much fun making it as we did watching it. Everyone did their bit although Lily James was outstanding as the young Donna.

Having at one time owned practically every ABBA album released (except for the first one, Ring Ring), I realized just how much I missed hearing all of the songs. If a potential moviegoer is not totally familiar and in love with the entire amount of their music, then I would not recommend attending. I am a huge ABBA fan and totally enjoyed the complete movie (as well as choreography) and songs presented. In fact, I wish the five repeated songs from the first film had not been repeated but had been replaced with five others (""As Good As New"", ""Lovers (Live a Little Longer)"", ""Ring Ring"", ""If It Wasn't for the Nights"", and ""The Way Old Friends Do.""

445,curlyfries-983-327714,Something Lacking,6,29 July 2018,"As a huge fan of the first mamma Mia, I was beyond excited to see what this sequel held. I'd heard great things about this film, some even saying it equalled and was even better than the first. And while it's true I had high hopes for this film, even if these hopes weren't quite as high as they were, I think I still would have felt the same. In short, the newer cast just weren't as good as the original cast. They weren't as funny (I needed more Julie Walters) or as good in the musical numbers. Lily James though I have to say was brilliant. Her voice was like velvet and she really carried the film through. But really, she was the only new cast member I enjoyed. The songs: 
While I thought the song choices were great! There was something that was just a bit lack lustre in all of the performances. Maybe it's becauss the voices weren't as strong and there wasn't as much need for ""belting"" which I think is a necessity in a musical. The style kind of reminded me of La la land (sorry, wasn't a fan) where the performances just didn't hit that sweet spot. The numbers for me were also too big, too many people I couldn't see who was who, and it made the experience a lot less intimate then I would have liked. However there were some gems like angel eyes and kissed the teacher. Story: so to me there wasn't really a storyline. Not on the same level as the first film. In short, Sophie is re-opening the hotel and in the mean time we flashback to Donna's life. SPOILER. For what good reason did they need to kill Donna off, REALLY. MERYL Streep literally made the firs film, and I think it was a real shame we missed out on her talents for this instalment. If you are a fan of musicals, you will enjoy this film. But I'm sorry to say that this was not the Mamma Mia I had hoped and wished for.",Mamma Mia! Here We Go Again

450,louise-swift,Not to be taken seriously,10,1 August 2019,"I don't understand why there are so many poor reviews of this movie! It's a musical... it's cheesy and corny and makes zero sense but my god!! What an emotional rollercoaster! I have been an abba head all my life, there is not one song that doesn't bring back some sort of memory for me because ABBA have been my own personal theme tune forever! When I was kid it was vinyl, as a teen it was tapes and then CD's and now obviously streaming but I never left home without my collection! My daughter is the spit and image of Sophie and I was a single mother so Sophie and donnas relationship is very similar to our own. When I saw the first movie in the cinema I burst in to tears from the very beginning and the scene where Donna helps Sophie get ready for her wedding just killed me! It was just so raw for me and I was imagining the day when I would be helping Chloe on her wedding day.The second movie I was at the cinema for the opening day with my mother and my daughter in tow! I have terminal cancer and I had no idea they had killed Donna off so once again it was very raw for me! I spent the last 30 minutes of the movie making strange wailing sounds because I was trying not to ruin the movie for the other viewers! BIG FAT UGLY SNOTTY TEARS! Not just from me but from my daughter too! My husband has now put the movie on the banned list because of the way it effects us. I think when the time comes and I am gone this movie will be special to my daughter because of our shared memories.",Mamma Mia! Here We Go Again

452,nic127-713-402104,Lazy writing,8,22 July 2018,"The story could have still be told without killing off Donna! They could have had Sophia's character facing a Delimma by losing Skye and finding out she was pregnant, while her and Donna were building the Hotel of their dreams. Sophia still could have returned without Skye and received the call that he was offered the job! How was she going to deal with having and raising a child alone. Flashbacks of Donnas life as she reread's her Diary on the Island, Donna describes more in detail of how her life was alone raising a child and she can do it! Cher's character was just not necessary. She didn't even attend her daughter's funeral or birth of her grand daughter but shows up for an opening of a hotel? Seemed to me the biggest complaint I was hearing was A- they killed off Donna and B- they never even told us how she died! If the song Fernando was important to put in, they could have brought Cher's character in still, with a surprise look from Donna! And it would have tied Donna's draw to the Island that her mother had told her about! They could have even have made Fernando's Donna's Dad and that's why Cher's character left the island!",Mamma Mia! Here We Go Again
453,amflint,A great movie to see with the girls,8,11 August 2018,"Saw this movie for the second time today. I can definitely say I thoroughly enjoyed it again. Yes you could quibble about Meryl being left out with no explanation for her death and the back stories of the three Dads being different to the first movie but all in all it is a really entertaining movie. The songs are so slickly produced and the dancing sequences so well choreographed it is immensely enjoyable. Yes there are a few songs that are not as well known as the usual ABBA hits but who wants to see a repeat of every single song from the first movie? I enjoyed hearing some fresh material and really think it added to the story. Bjorn and Benny's songs have been seamlessly blended into the narrative. Watch out for these two in 'blink or you'll miss it' cameos. Lily James is fantastic as the young Donna. You can't take your eyes off her and her singing is a standout. Also some nice eye candy in the form of the young guys - particularly the young Bill! As for Cher, well she is almost unrecognisable but certainly makes an impact. If you want pure escapism for two enjoyable hours I recommend this movie.",Mamma Mia! Here We Go Again
454,matildaftw1,Did we really need Cher that much?,1,27 July 2018,"We already knew that beating the first one was gonna be impossible but I at least thought they were gonna be in the same league. The flashbacks were great!! They should have spent more time on them as they seem well thought through and made sense to me as an audience. But the present time scenes were so dull and forced that I couldn't stop rolling my eyes. WHY did Donna have to be dead? Seriously it made no contribution to the story other than giving the audience something to ""cry"" about. And of course I'm dead happy that Cher was a part of this she is a legend! But then why couldn't this movie revolve more about the relationship between Sophie and her grandmother? She just forgave her in an heartbeat for not being there for 25years??And musicals. If you've used songs before, you don't use them in the sequel.",Mamma Mia! Here We Go Again
455,Cindymecindy,Audience was silent and only laughed once,3,20 July 2018,"Saw Mamma Mia 2 today. No spoilers.... What a sad ride. No one in our movie theater laughed except one time and it was the line by Colin Firth that was already in the Trailer...""I told many, many people"". That's it. One laugh. Also, I wondered what music they would play. Even big artists only have so many super-hits. The rest of their albums contain secondary songs that never made radio time. That's what they used in this movie. 90% of the music I had never heard before because they weren't their biggest hits.Also, it's a prequel, so it explains how all the men met Meryl Streep when she was young. Lily James was amazing, but it was like watching a B-movie with a bunch of no-names... As I said, no one laughed in the theater, except once. And then you cry at the end. And the directing was awful. There were many ""jokes"" but they all failed and no one laughed. Cher already has a thickish tongue naturally but add that to her age and she just mumbled all her lines and they were almost unintelligible. Often the music was too loud to hear her lines and that's why her jokes didn't get laughs. That's the director's fault. As well, all the other jokes were SUPER QUIET and mumbled as well, falling flat. Like the joke in the trailer where Christine Baranski meets Andy Garcia and she WHISPERS ""have him washed and brought to my tent"". Every line was whispered, uneventful and lost...Still, you should see it so you know the prequel of the story. Just don't expect a rip-roaring good time. And again, no spoilers, but I'll just say that Meryl Streep's money demands must not have been met for the sequel. There's really no other explanation... You'll figure out what that means once you see the movie. What a waste.",Mamma Mia! Here We Go Again
456,kimmeea13,A Worthy Follow-Up to the Original,9,21 July 2018,"Where do I begin? I was/am a huge fan of the first Mamma Mia so the bar was set really high for this one. I unashamedly love pop music and cheesiness, so both movies are right in my wheelhouse.Here We Go Again is a sequel as well as a prequel, showing us Donna's life before Sophie was born, and Sophie's life after her mother has passed on. The young versions of Sam, Bill, and Harry were recognizable and resembled the adult characters. Lily James as young Donna was perfect! We heard the story of the three dads in the first movie, but now we are able to see how it could have happened. And then there was Cher. Oh my. She was excellent, and there was just enough of her. Really this movie was like visiting with some old friends and catching up on each other's lives. I laughed, I cried (a lot!), and I was sorry when it ended. There are tons of inside jokes and nods to some of the best parts of the original. If you don't like camp or cheesy pop music and you can't take a good joke, you might want to stay away. If you know how to have a good time and laugh at yourself, come on over and join the party.",Mamma Mia! Here We Go Again

458,anjapgr,"Funny, emotional and way better than the first one",8,13 August 2018,"It is one of those movies every girl should see with her mother. I went with mine and we had lots of fun, although she liked the first one better. I didn't. I loved the first one, but this one has a better story, better acting and was really made to make you cry. However I didn't enjoy songs that much, only because some of them aren't as famous as the ones from the first movie and I couldn't sing along. 
Also this movie had a major flaw. Cher. All right, they decided to forget that Donna said her mother is dead (in the first movie). I can live with that. It would actually be really nice to see how her mother dealt with Donna's death. I would love seeing an emotional scene where she says how sorry she is that she let Donna down and didn't help her with Sophie. But all she did was singing Fernando and... that is it. The movie showed us how she always let Donna down, but everybody were still really nice to her, although she didn't even act like she is sorry. I really hated her role, not because of her character but because she was completely pointless. It would be better leaving her dead.",Mamma Mia! Here We Go Again
459,sgrantdj,Sad.,8,5 August 2018,"I hate the fact that we are told Donna has died in the first few minutes of this film. It just leaves the whole film feeling really sad and tinged with tragedy all the way through. And the stupid thing is she didn't need to die. There was no reason for it and the film would have worked so much better if she had just been alive.. the flashbacks would still have made sense. It's good, yes it has some less known music, but did it move me..? Yes. Did I tap my feet along..? Yes.. did I smile and laugh.. yes. So yes, it's good. Just really really cross that they made us all fee sad for the whole movie right from the start. And yes they shoe horn a slightly awkward Cher into the end section.",Mamma Mia! Here We Go Again

461,grilices,Take a chance on this one!,8,18 July 2018,"So, ten years after ""Mamma Mia!"", here we go again! 
I must say that I recognize that the first movie is not a great movie but I really like it. This time, after watching the trailers, my expectations were really high. I watched the movie yesterday and now I can say that I loved it. And it is way better than the first one. 
The movie shows a young Donna, played by the amazing Lily James - that looks great in this movie and, oh!, she is a great singer! It is really funny to watch how she met the ""three fathers"", Sam, Bill and Harry - and also must say that Jeremy Irvine, Josh Dylan and Hugh Skinner are great too. 
At the same time, since all the scenes from the young Donna are only flashbacks, we see how is Sophie's life, after a tragedy in the family. Yes, we have another party here, so the plot is basically the same as the first movie. But this movie knew exactly what people like in ""Mamma Mia!"", so everything here looks fine and it's really enjoyable. 
This time everyone can sing properly, even Pierce Brosnan. And the choreographys are beautiful, especially the one for the song ""Dancing Queen"". 
Just to finish, I need to say that the end of the movie is a beautiful surprise. Everyone that liked ""Mamma Mia!"" will like this movie. And I think those who didn't like the first movie should give a chance to this one.",Mamma Mia! Here We Go Again

The comedy aspect did not disappoint and Cher's rendition of Fernando was amazing. Didn't give it a 10 purely because it's not really a serious film , and Pierce Brosnan's singing voice hadn't improved one bit (although that being said his singing voice didn't get as much screen time, so I can forgive this) basically a great film, even people I know who hate musicals like this film",Mamma Mia!

473,nicoguinle,Mamma Mia!! Did They Go Again!!! YESS,10,27 July 2018,"It was just magical to enjoy this wonderful actors portraying amazing characters. It may seem a little too hyperbolic, but I genuinely LOVED it. The harmony with wich they maneged the old and the new, was refreshing and yet exciting as it brings back memories. Exquisite how it was written, and how the songs really connected with the script. I entered the theatre with my expectations high, and the movie defenitly fufilled them. 
I got very emotional during the song ""My Love, My Life"". By its meaning, buy the appearance of Maryland Streep, and the selection of voices for the song. Meryl has that love if and motherly tone in her singing voice, and either Amanda or Lily missed a pitch (along the whole movie). 
I hadn't heard the soundtrack before watching it, so I heard the songs as I watched. I really enjoyed that they used both known and no-so-known ABBA melodies. Moreover, the repetition of the classics from the first one just fits. 
Only one complain, as much as I love Lily James, and how lovely Hugh Skinner seemed to be, the choreography for ""Waterloo"" seemed a bit too exaggerated. But how do yoo convince a girl to sleep with you having just met her? Probably by singing a little too exaggerated. 
And Cher. What is there to say apart from the fact that every one in the theatre (EVERY ONE) gasped in excitement when she said that Seños Cienfuegos was called Fernando. And, let's just say, she slated it.
Finally, it was tragic that Donna had to die, being so loved, but that really gave savour to the story, making the flashbacks even more meaningful. 
All in all, the movie is FENOMENAL!!! You'll leave being humbling Super Truper and deciding who's angel eyes you love more, Tanya's or Rosie's.",Mamma Mia! Here We Go Again

Many of songs were just repeated from the first film and even though they were artfully and creatively presented it was quite disappointing that only a limited number of songs were new additions to the storyline. The script as charming as it was didn't have a single wow factor and should have never left the desk of the unfortunate soul who had to edit it. Most of the acting done in Lily James' scenes seemed overdone and sadly fragmented my past views of the lovable characters, Harry especially. If you absolutely loved the first movie, I would recommend melon balling your eyes out before seeing I would not recommend watching this pity excuse for a sequel to such a wonderful film.

All characters are totally flat and immature, their reactions to the events in the film are unrealistic and you cannot relate to anyone. The worst thing in the movie for me was Cher, I can't understand why everyone admires her in this film. Her voice is great without question, but she looks like a dead doll of undefineable age, she can't move her face a bit and therefore can't do any acting apparently.In addition, I could recognize instantly that there was something wrong with the ages of the characters and looked it up after the film... in fact, Cher is only 3 years older than Meryl Streep, and Meryl Streep is 37 years older than Amanda Seyfield.

479,cainington,Marvellous Momma Mia,9,11 September 2018,"MAMMA MIA 2! Here we go again
 Singing, dancing, ABBA songs and a star-studded plot twist is all packed within this film. You can watch this film in your local cinema and enjoy the theatrical experience of a lifetime. I really enjoyed this film and thought it was better than the original! It really stood out as one of my all-time favourite films. ABBA made all the songs in this film and included all of the favourites such as: Dancing Queen and a stunning Fernando sung by the one and only Cher.
 Lilly James takes the lead role along with Amanda Seyfried. It followed the storyline of a young Donna's life in comparison to her lovable daughter Sophie's life. *Look away now or read this spoiler* Donna appears dead in this film so Sophie rebuilds Hotel Bella Donna on the infamous Greek island Skopelos (1 year after her death) in memory of her mum. She has a secret surprise visit from her grandmother who moved to America while she couldn't care less about her family. Sophie then finds out she is expecting a baby!
 I really liked this film because I love musical theatre and ABBA so this was amazing! I don't see why no one would find this enjoyable. My favourite character is young Donna because she is a strong and positive character. She is also really passionate and adventurous. Girl power! I would definitely recommend this film to anyone who hasn't watched this. I could watch this film repeatedly if I was allowed. I thought the ABBA songs fit well with the storyline it was almost as if the producers had made the songs after the script. My favourite scene in the film was when Sophie had a vision of Donna at the end. I definitely would recommend this.",Mamma Mia! Here We Go Again

491,fanball8,Little smile factor in comparison to the original,6,21 July 2018,"Mamma Mia! Here We Go Again, takes place five years after the original movie, as Sophie (Amanda Seyfried) prepares a party for the grand reopening of her mother's Hotel Bella Donna on Kalokairi. Through flashbacks, a second plot-line set in 1979 reveals how young Donna (Lily James) met and romanced the young Sam, Bill, and Harry who became Sophie's fathers.The 1979 plot-line, which was written to fill in the long-awaited details of how Donna became involved with Sam, Bill, and Harry, was, for the most part, uninspired. The attraction between Young Donna and the charming Bill (Josh Dylan) was believable, and a bright spot in the movie. The development of Donna's feelings for Sam (Jeremy Irvine) and Harry (Hugh Skinner) were unconvincing, though, and it seems that the songs in these scenes were used to cover up for the lack of chemistry between the characters.Cast-wise, the lovely and charming Lily James carried the show. She sang beautifully, turned in an outstanding acting performance, and most of her scenes made for striking cinematography. Cher (as Ruby Sheridan) rode the strength of ""Fernando"" to one of the musical's highlight numbers, but her performance in ""Super Trouper"" was lackluster. Director Ol Parker did not measure up to Phyllida Lloyd's impressive directing in the original Mamma Mia! The supporting players, Christine Baranski, Julie Walters, Pierce Brosnan, Colin Firth, and Stellan Skarsgard were not well portrayed in some scenes by Parker, and the actors looked awkward at times. Lloyd's use of facial close-ups and angles in the original were brilliant by comparison.Five songs; Waterloo, ""I Have a Dream,"" ""The Name of the Game,"" ""Mamma Mia,"" ""Dancing Queen,"" and ""Super Trouper"" from the original Mamma Mia! are featured in this prequel.The dance scenes mostly looked bland in comparison to the original. The ""Gimme! Gimme! Gimme! (A Man After Midnight)"" -- ""Voulez-Vous"" party sequence of the original movie was spectacular in comparison.There are a few good songs that were not used in the original. Early in the movie, Lily James turns in a sexy performance with ""When I Kissed the Teacher,"" wearing retro-style pinstriped pants that accentuate her curvy hips. Mostly, though, the writers reached pretty deep to present music in Here We Go Again that wasn't sung in the original. Unfortunately, this resulted in many of the musical segments feeling forced into the story line. Also, Director Ol Parker falls well short of achieving the enjoyable visual and audio quality of the original film's musical numbers.While the on-scene sets were mostly in Greece in the original, most of the on-scene sets in Mamma Mia! Here We Go Again were in Croatia. Although they tried to achieve similar scenic effects in Here We Go Again, the scenery is better in the original.The original Mamma Mia!, with an excellent cast, superb directing, intense face close-ups, choice song selection, beautiful scenery, and superbly-produced musical numbers resulted in a huge smile factor for me throughout the movie. Mamma Mia! Here We Go Again fell well short of the original in all these aspects, with few smiles.",Mamma Mia! Here We Go Again
492,lyndean-4,Absolutely loved it,10,28 July 2018,I wasn't expecting this movie to be as good as the first one but actually it's better. I thought I knew all the ABBA songs but I found out there were some beautiful songs they wrote. Some great one liners from Christine Baranski who looks fabulous. Definitely will go see this again. And of course how can you beat Cher and that incredible voice of hers. Go see this movie for yourself it's fun and delightful. You will laugh and cry,Mamma Mia! Here We Go Again

495,redb38,Why?,1,22 July 2018,I felt really let down by the creators of this film. Why would they make a movie without the main character because they had killed her off already. The film was depressing. I may be the only one that has this view...,Mamma Mia! Here We Go Again
496,Nobbysetter,Don't bother,2,1 September 2020,"Seems very like a low-budget version of the original; Abba's timeless songs performed in thin, reedy little voices, with backing music that sounds as though three-quarters of the band failed to turn up. Quite an achievement, to downgrade Abba's magnificent music into something that would fail to win applause at the pub music night.
A rather nice sailing boat which doesn't hoist its sails, but floats around aimlessly a few yards from shore... I could go on, but why bother?",Mamma Mia! Here We Go Again
497,mcunningham-10,Best Sequel Ever!!,10,20 July 2018,"We laughed, we cried, we sang along! The best sequel to an original film I have EVER seen. I even liked it better than the original (gasp!). For me, I loved the story switching between young Donna and adult Sofie. The interwoven back story was well done. The cast was phenomenal. Thank you to the vocal coach who worked with Mr. Brosnan, and the directors who made his musical contribution much-less cringeworthy than the first go-around. It's a definite go-see summer flick. Highly recommend. Thanks for the music!",Mamma Mia! Here We Go Again
498,TeaStation,"If you liked the first ""Momma Mia"", you'll hate this one!",1,24 November 2018,"Ok call me old fashioned but the 1st movie starred Meryl Streep! This one does not! She did not die at the end of the last one, nor in my opinion should she be dead at the opening of this one. I think it's all about her daughter and her as a younger character actually I guess I am so disappointed with it I could not wait to fast forward through most of it. Christine Baranski and Julie Walters are barely in it, none of the men that were in the original movie I haven't seen.. It's like not a sequel, I read it's a prequel. So if it is why is Meryl Streep's character dead?I admit I am hung up on this and it COMPLETELY RUINED it for me. I'm tired of a lot of the writers and producers these days saying we are going to leave it to the ""younger crowd!"" screw dat! I'm 56 I know when a movie is good and when a movie isn't. You leave it all to the younger crowd it aint gonna work to well. Oh well, I would not waste the money!",Mamma Mia! Here We Go Again

500,bosley-brill,Unnecessary,3,2 August 2018,This movie had so much potential but instead of making it as good as the first one they made it kind boring and had unnecessary story lines. Only having Meryl in it for 5 minutes at the end was a bad move!!,Mamma Mia! Here We Go Again
501,mango6,Even Cher couldn't save it,5,29 August 2021,"They literally spend the entire movie crying over the fact that Maryl Streep was unavailable. It's the ultimate proof that Maryl was the one holding this whole production together. The experience of watching this film is very contradictory because they keep dancing and singing happy Abba songs while crying over dead Donna. And than in the end you get Cher killing the movie dead with her effortless singing of Fernando, demolishing your resolution to forgive the lack of singing voices of the rest of the cast.That one scene with Maryl in the end makes you cry hard over Donna, over Maryl being unavailable for shooting, over this illogical screenplay, over Cher not singing all the movie, and over the entire production altogether. So if you want to cry not knowing exactly why - this is the movie for you.It got 5 from me because Cher can't get any less.",Mamma Mia! Here We Go Again

504,pruber_rel,Failed comedy,7,19 August 2018,"Not that I expected much of this film considering that the first film was not a masterpiece, but at least it is fun and has fluidity in the plot, this last element is what the second part lacks; the musical themes seem to me that they are put to the force, without the naturalness of the first part. The performances of the original cast shine again, they feel comfortable with their character, but it is the new cast that does not convince, at least not everyone, including the leading role, who should be the most accurate in their interpretation. It is not completely bad but it is failed.",Mamma Mia! Here We Go Again

I loved the songs and the performances especially Lily James's. But I hated it because they killed Donna! Seriosly, how could they do that?? The first movie was basically based on her. It did not feel the same without her. It was really depressing. Yes Seyfried and James and everyone else was great, but not the same without Meryl Streep. They gave this depressing undertone to the movie which really bummed me. Even dancing queen was depressing. And I think they could have done it much better without killing Donna. I guess they just did it for not steeling focus from the parts of young Donna. I don't know. I really didn't like it and gave 6 just because of my love for the first movie.",Mamma Mia!

This movie is a bit slow in the beginning and the Cher makes an appearance- not much of a scene for such a Mega Star BUT that soon changes when she sees Andy Garcia and they sing Fernando ABBA - brings tears to your eyes. Meryl Streep ( who has passed away in the move ) also makes an appearance in the church ( close to the ending ) when the baby is being christened and leaves the church through the main doors into a bright light - clearly she leaves to Heaven ,,, absolutely riveting performances",Mamma Mia!

517,lgunderson-195-315283,Watchable But Slow,7,24 October 2018,"It is charming but the story was in need of a rewrite. Disjointed writing with no explanation of what happened to Donna. Without Meryl Streep except for the last scene, it wasn't really a sequel. It was more like a fake of the first Mama Mia. The most exciting part was Cher and Andy Garcia. It lacked the lively exciting pace of the first one. The actors were fine. We enjoyed it, and will watch it again. Won't buy it. It's worth watching.",Mamma Mia! Here We Go Again

In this one, they actually cared about getting some good choreography and singing in it. The story was refreshing. You can't just kick your feet and complain that because Maryl (who, by the way, was SO embarrassed by being in the original) was barely in it. Ultimately, the only parts that dragged were the parts with the original cast.
And at least it wasn't so autotuned that you couldn't hear the actors' voices (see: The Greatest Showman, Beauty and the Beast, etc).
It's a good musical that lets itself be a musical.",Mamma Mia! Here We Go Again

The acting and storyline is on point, all the songs are good and match perfectly too the story. I laughed and I cried and got all the feelings a good movie should give you.Lily James is just perfect for the part as Donna. She immediately catches your attention and I didn't want the movie to end because I couldn't get enough of her! The movie just wouldn't be the same without her. Jessica Wynn and Alexa Davies also deserve high praise for their parts and together they make the perfect trio. Of course you can't forget the original cast, Amanda, Dominic, Julie, Christine, Colin, Stellan and Pierce bring back all the memories from the first movie and hold nothing back when expressing their characters. The movie is easily a 10/10. I recommend it to anyone who loves a good romance/music movie. Just perfect in every way.",Mamma Mia! Here We Go Again
521,odakvanali,Could have been better,5,2 August 2018,"Bad things first. This movie was very disappointing. The story of this movie is weak and not to interesting. It is interesting that they explored Donna's past, but the story do not correspond with the original story that is briefly told in the original film, wich is probably the biggest flaw in this musical. Also, the songs are not of the highest caliber as they used the most famous ones in the last movie. Still it has its moments of nostalgia.The facr that Donna is not even alive anymore is weird. They killed of the main character from the last movie. This also makes the ending and start of the credits weird as she suddenly is there (only visible to amanda seyfrieds character though). The movie would have had great potential with her character alive. What sort of carries this movie along is the humour along with some of the classic songs that is in the movie. Especially the three dads are funny. And it is the characters from the original movie that carries it. The flashbacks are not to bad either, but it is the original characters who stands out. Sadly, the music and the humour do not weigh up for the lack of story and the flaws of this movie.",Mamma Mia! Here We Go Again

WOW!!! The rest of the movie was pure joy... great music, lots of fun. Lily James did a super job portraying Streep's character's younger self. My only regret was that I wanted more of Cher and a LOT more of Meryl, as those two don't show up until the last segment of the movie, and never really interact with each other. So be prepared that's what you get. However, the other characters and their younger counterparts (much of the movie is through flash backs) did not disappoint. And how can you go wrong rocking with the music of Abba all the way to the end? Yes, I need to go see it again. ""Here I go....again!""",Mamma Mia! Here We Go Again

I can't stop listening to the soundtracks either and I'm definitely gonna but the movie, so I can see it a million times. The story in this movie was good and with the choices of songs it was very catching. I was just so happy through the whole movie and after! Maybe a bit disappointed that they didn't film it in Greece this time as well as the first one and that it didn't match more with the first movie.
But even thinking of the movie still makes me happy days after, and yes I had to go to the movie theater to watch it again!",Mamma Mia! Here We Go Again

It was so fun and did a great job exaplining why Donna didn't know who the dad was without making her look sl***y. I know a lot of people were disappointed in MStreep not being in the movie much but for me that was a huge plus. I walk the last :10 minutes of the movie ALL THE TIME.

Lily James was outstanding as young Donna. Yes it was a shame Meryl Streep didn't play a bigger part but such is life. Take it for what it is. There were a couple of songs i didn't know so it may have been better keeping to the well known songs, however they did fit in with the script. It was a rollercoaster or emotions.

We were supposed to be falling in love with her again especially since she died between the two movies. But this movie made me despise her. Sure she was caring for her friends and daughter but she was so incredibly self-serving and pushy that I fast forward through parta where Lily James isn't singing. For that, what a shame.",Mamma Mia!

The emotion of losing someone dear to you really came forward, as did the effects of such tragedy. The fact that Donna's younger self meets her three lovers and spends tine with them gives you a sense of who they were before. The casting was absolutely fantastic, seeing as most of te characters were believable as younger versions. Even though it is a shame that it didn't quite match to the decisions made in the first movie, I found that the facts, feelings, emotions and explanations added up in the sequel. The feeling of having family is inportant, and exactly that was the message sent through the entire movie. The songs and dances were very fitting, I sat through the whole movie with enthousiasm and emotion, thank you Mamma Mia!",Mamma Mia! Here We Go Again

Instead of my being lost in the story and characters like I was with Mamma Mia, she pulls you out of the story and screams, ""look at me, I'm Cher saying witty things"", and while the others dance, she stands stiffly like she's being held up by scaffolding and walks like she needs a Rollator. What a big disappointment.",Mamma Mia! Here We Go Again
538,Becky_L,A great emotional journey with clunky bits along the way.,8,23 July 2018,"The first Mamma Mia was not perfect. We all have seen it and we all like to moan about the same things. Pierce Brosnan's bad singing being one. And, yes, he can't sing, and he still can't sing. But things like that became the charm of Mamma Mia. The rest of the story was so heartfelt and feel good. All I wanted to do was stand up in the cinema and sing along with everyone else having a great time. There was some conflict driven, sadder moments, such as Slipping Through My Fingers, but they were more bitter sweet than anything else. Also, I felt the story line was consistent and each scene served the plot. I gave it the full 10 star. Mamma Mia: Here We Go Again changes tack. This movie is not positive vibes all the time. In fact, an element of sadness underpins a lot of it. It tackles deeper emotions which, I feel was nailed in the end. But there are also lots of groan worthy moments and random bits that made the whole film feel just a little less polished. Running through the whole story is a focus on connection between Donna and Sophie which I thought was beautifully done. Their relationship was the heart of the first film and it was great to see it continue to be the heart in the second. After the early scenes where certain plot elements were revealed, I was worried but, ultimately, I think they, mostly, nailed the new angle in Donna and Sophie's relationship. This was achieved by the interweaving of Donna's past and Sophie in the present. Sophie thinking back to what happened to her mother on that faithful summer. At first, this interweaving felt a clunky. I wanted them to just get back to exploring Donna's past. But once we got into the deeper stuff, towards the end, the story really started to shine and I was crying. The final scene was the best part of the whole film, and I could finally see how most of the interweaving storyline was leading up to it. It hit me in the feels more than anything that happened in the first movie. Donna is the most interesting character in both movies. I enjoyed seeing her past in more detail and how she met each of Sophie's dads. Particularly in Donna's relationship with Sam as that is the most complex out of the three. Having watched the first film quite a few times now, there were some continuity errors between the two but nothing too major that it ruined it in the end. Overall, I was more invested in this storyline than in the present-day storyline. I wish there was more of it. I felt like some things were just left hanging that didn't need to be. If the whole film was Donna's past, I would have been very happy. But I understand why they went with interweaving past and present as I mentioned earlier. This film would not have the emotional impact if it didn't have Sophie's journey as well. The elements of Sophie's development that you see were well done. I definitely connected with Sophie a bit more this time round. I wish there was bit more Sophie and Sam bonding time though. Each scene where we got to see the two of them alone was great. They were some of the best scenes from the present-day. They not only show their affection for Donna but for each other as well. I know that the whole point is that Sam, Harry and Bill are her dads equally, but Sam's step father role really dominates here. Gimme, gimme, gimme more of it. Then comes the rest of the present-day storyline. Look, I love Bill, Harry, Rosie and Tanya in the first film. It wouldn't be the same without them. They are crucial, with Rosie and Tanya being that support mechanism/comic relief, and Bill and Harry, alongside Sam, being kind of the point of the whole plot. However, in this film, I felt like they had been put into the story just because they needed to be in there. Because we need to get all the old cast back in. I feel a lot of the present-day storyline could have been trimmed back to allow more time in the past. While Rosie and Tanya provide some support for Sophie, I feel like exploring more of the connection between Sam and Sophie would have felt more natural to the characters in their situation. Rosie and Tanya after all don't live with her. I can't deny they did bring some good comic relief though and the jokes were good (there were some groans too), but not if it feels a bit unnatural. As for Bill and Harry they definitely feel mostly like side appearances than anything else. Sorry boys. Then there were some of the side plots that felt shoe horned in. Present day Bill and Rosie. Don't need the conflict. Could have just been resolved. Then there was a small drama with Sky which again I don't think was really needed either. And as for Ruby, the grandmother. What was the point? I can kind of see what they were trying to do but ultimately it was unnecessary. I just rolled my eyes through the whole thing really. Oh, and Oxford at the beginning. Yeah ok. What? If there were less of these moments and the storyline was tighter, then my rating may have been higher. I liked the small Alexio storyline though. That was funny. I could go on to talk about the acting and the singing but this is a Mamma Mia movie. It was not Oscar worthy but I never expected it to be. It was good and nobody was a deal breaker. Pierce Brosnan's bad singing included. Now maybe I am looking into the storyline and characters way too deeply. After all, Mamma Mia is not a film you look into deeply. But with the added emotional depth in the storyline, I can't help myself. This was not the beginning to end feel good romp movie I expected going in. It had happy good times but also hard-hitting emotional times. Unlike the first film you will not be smiling all the way through. You may cry as well. Which is a good thing and I loved it. Unfortunately, this film did bring out the eye rolls a few times in a bad way which, despite the cheese and dodgy acting, the first film never did.",Mamma Mia! Here We Go Again

540,daniquejanssen-70624,"Okay movie, but only if you don't pay attention to (continuity) details",5,11 August 2018,"Overall I enjoyed this movie more than the first Mamma Mia. There was less pointless hysterical screaming by the main characters and there was actually some kind of storyline, so I thought it was more interesting to watch. However, the timeline is a mess. It seems like the writers did not even look into anything that was said about Donna's early life in the first movie. The 80's looks in the pictures that were shown - all these men in their hippie years with their summer love - was miraculously changed into a modern lovestory with boys that straight up look like they walked out of a magazine. It just felt.... very unreal for me. What happened to the tattoos and the mustaches from the pictures? They even changed the chronological order in which Donna wouldve met the boys according to her diary, which is unnecessary in my opinion. Also, the second movie was set 5 years after the first one, which is a weird choice considering how all the actors changed with the time and what must've happened between them (the huge renovation). And what happened to Sophie's friends?? 
All in all, okay movie with some decent jokes and storyline but don't think too much about it or you'll just be annoyed at all the plot holes when you reach the end of the movie.",Mamma Mia! Here We Go Again

544,rikayahcarver,Nothing like the first film,1,1 December 2018,"Many things were different from the first film-Harry's guitar
-Sophia's story (who Sophie is named after)
-Flashbacks, nothing like the original that was said in the diary (Harry Headbanger
-Donnas friends never meet any of the boys or even came to the island
Donnas Mother is supposed to be dead but nope she's alive some how (could of been fixed with a simple ""we thought you were dead"")Overall they just wanted to see how much money they could make even though they only watched the first movie once",Mamma Mia! Here We Go Again

Songs were ok, the young Donna saved the movie. Wonderful actress.",Mamma Mia! Here We Go Again

547,sianie-26962,Amazing acting---Terrible storyline And I thought the new actors and past Donna was what I needed to worry about!,6,22 July 2018,"I am amazed how much I love young Donna, from the 'best girl power gang' to Harry, Bill and Sam I don't think the writers could have done better.....they must have had an off day or month when they wrote the present day story line.Mamma Mia 2 broke my heart, Mamma Mia OG taught us about girl power and that Donna did it by herself..........making it clear that her mother had no part in helping create her and Sophie's world, the world I loved. So as amazing as Cher was....which she was, Ruby coming in is all a little too late. 
Donna being dead was a mistake but its not what made me leave the cinema sad and confused. 
What did that was that Donna built this world for her and her daughter and had no hep in doing that, she walked away from her mother and didn't return to her in 25 years because she and Sophie we're better without her and now Donnas dead its like they gave up on girl power and single parent power...I just don't get it....Deciding to walk into your granddaughters life once your own daughters dead doesn't make up for the past and shouldn't be so simply happy......Im seriously confused about it.And I thought the new actors and past Donna was what I needed to worry about!The songs were great, the acting was brilliant and the young cast fit perfectly. But when you take away the singing and dancing it just let down everything Mamma Mia OG stood for. Yes it was funny and for the most upbeat but leaving the cinema it wasn't the singing and dancing I was thinking about. The upbeat feeling didn't stick this time, it left and in its place I felt disappointed and almost let down.It wasn't what I hoped for.
Its not what you're going to reach for when you need to be cheered up. Mamma Mia Here We Go Again doesn't leave you feeling that good.",Mamma Mia! Here We Go Again
548,sianie-26962,Mamma Mia.....I was broken hearted WHY WHY WHY!!,6,22 July 2018,"I loved the music, I shocked myself by loving the new members of the cast and the story of young Donna, but was left completely broken hearted by the story line of the present day.
It just felt like the power of Donna, single parents and women had been lost.
The purpose of Mamma Mia OG had been lost.....Its not what you're going to reach for when you need cheering up like you do with the first movie. I left the cinema feeling disappointed and with some regret of watching it if I'm honest because in my head Donna, Sophie and everyone else was living in a world where things were never easy or simple but always had a silver lining. This didn't feel like much of a silver lining.You was left feeling as cheated by the movie as Donna felt by Sam.Mamma Mia 2- 'Yes ive been 'left' broken hearted'",Mamma Mia! Here We Go Again

551,teddyyorks-01078,"Richard Curtis/Ol Parker, how dare you!!!",1,6 August 2018,"Myself and my partner, are lucky enough to have free cinema tickets every week. Which is a relief, because if i would of had to have paid for this shower, i'd probably end up hunting the writers (term used loosely) down, and personally berating them on this atrocity to cinema.
I didn't watch the first one, but my better half wanted to go, and i agreed thinking well if its just mediocre, i'm sure it'll be a feel good story. 
However, i ended up leaving the theatre just plain angry.
The plot of the movie, is a young girl builds a hotel in memory of her mother. Which is fine, except it took 2 hours to tell this story. Interspersed with a large collection of ABBA hits. (I do actually enjoy ABBA's music). Links into each song were hammy, some having no relevance to the overall plotline. The links sounding something like ""remember the time we went on a boat in 1979?"", then it would go straight into the number. Like an am-dram production. Or a pantomime. Which is apt, as even the best performers of the hits were of that standard at best. Cher was probably the only one with any real voice, and shes kept on with that warbling bit she does.
The only real plus point of the film, is that it looked spectacular. It really was beautiful on screen, Ol Parker redeemed himself a bit here, after his efforts as co-writer.
The screenplay was actually criminal. I'm not a major Richard Curtis fan (apart from Blackadder), but his previous film, actually held some complexity to the storyline. This was basically Mr Parker and Mr Curtis, being given a list of songs that need to be performed, and being told to fit a screenplay around it. I'm sure they could of done a much better job if they tried, they both have some very good peices of work to their names. But this was just plain lazy! And to be honest insulting. 2 hours to watch a young girl open a hotel. I would of better spent my time driving around the city centre for that amount of time, listening to ABBA's greatest hits on my stereo. Performed as they should. Not by a group of people who struggle to carry a tune.
We watch a fair share of bad films when we go to the cinema. But i have never come out angry before.",Mamma Mia! Here We Go Again
552,done-15846,Phyllida Lloyd's sensitive touch badly needed here,2,4 August 2018,"While the first movie was somewhat melodramatic and a bit corny, it did have the great music, a great sense of fun, engagement, warmth and excitement to it that is missing here. The first one had some people overacting but it had balance and fitted so much better than in this version. Lily James did a great job as the young Donna, and everyone tried their best to make it a repeat performance, but it really did need Phyllida's touch to add the necessary magic. I was starting to doze off within 10 min and then to have Cher included was an unnecessary and awful decision. She looked younger than Meryl, for goodness sake - but so plastic. Despite all this, the songs kept me watching and it really was good to see Meryl at the end.",Mamma Mia! Here We Go Again
553,kwaters-39544,A sequel done right,10,22 July 2018,"Every girl should absolutely go see it with their mom. Its such a beautiful mother daughter film. I laughed (alot), i cried (a little) and sang along to all of the songs! 10/10. Well worth the long wait for this sequel. Most sequels suck, this has a beautiful narrative, the songs fit perfectly with the story's quirky nature. Some stuff from the1st movie isnt shown in the flashbacks, but its minor and forgiving it also doesnt mess with the storyline. Lilly james is perfect as young donna. Peirce Brosnan is amazing, you can really tell how much he cares for Donna when he looks back on her photos and sings SOS, i teared up, and the beautiful Christening scene at the end of the movie with young Donna and Sophie, and Sophie as an adult with her baby just matches the tone perfectly. I dare anyone to not tear up at that part. As I said most sequels fail to match the first one in many ways either by pacing, tone, style, story, ect; This is not one of those films, this was a movie that was done right.",Mamma Mia!

554,andrew-78684,"Fun, sassy and self effacing-good job",8,20 July 2018,"Lilly Allen is utterly enchanting, she belts out the songs with energy, sexiness and youth, I loved her performance.
Mamma Mia 2 made the whole cinema laugh and clap. The songs are not the ones we know from our youth, but ABBA were such accomplished song writers that they carry the lumpy story over the Greek sparkling seas and into your heart.
I found the flashbacks with Allen more powerful than the present day story and the old Donna's sidekicks were struggling to find a place in the chronology. As for the Big Bang end with Cher, the tongue in cheek lead in to Fernando is nonsense, but such fun that you just go with it.
An utterly worthy successor to the brilliant MM1 and 10 year on from now, let's see the same done with Queen songs.",Mamma Mia! Here We Go Again

556,kadenmiddleton,Great movie - If you can get past some inconsistencies,9,23 July 2018,"As the title says, the movie was really enjoyable, with a great story that explains how Donna got to where she was in the first movie.

The sequel was not at all fun, flirty and happy. Lots of plot holes - did they really have wireless microphones in the 70s? and how does a picture taken in the 70s have such amazing pixels / resolution when printed in present times? the entire movie was just sad.

560,anseltanwj,Amazing!,10,2 August 2018,"I went into the theatre with very low standards but I must say I was very impressed! Such a beautiful storyline, with ups and downs and twists and turns that hit you unexpectedly, leaving you unable to see it coming somehow catching you off-guard every single time. Some characters definitely lacked much depth, many being simple cliches, but overall the majority of the characters were round and full of personality. Unfortunately, Meryl Streep has a near non-existent role in the film near the end, but the rest of the characters definitely added so much to making this movie so great. I found there to be also some plotholes throughout the movie, however the exceptional storyline makes up for much of it. I have to say that Colin Firth's performance, in particular, was amusing, adding the same bespoke comedy and charm like he always does to many of his films. Overall, this film brings a heartwarming story to the theatres. Such an amazing story and definitely a must-see. It has definitely become one of my favourite films at the moment. I didn't think they were able to outdo themselves from the first one, but this movie makes a good example of what a good sequel, one that lives up to and exceeds its expectations, should be.",Mamma Mia!

561,teonileonaa,Mamma Mia in deed.,4,4 August 2018,"The film had much more depth than the first one. It's cinematography was astonishing and the songs were uplifting. I do feel like the plot was not at all there and therefore lost a star. I feel like this is more of a sequel than a prequel so therefore you do not need to watch the first one to watch the second one. They are different forms of the movie. However, it was more emotional so took away slightly from the upbeat vibes but also gave a lot of depth which makes it such an amazing movie with amazing actors and transitions.",Mamma Mia!

Personally i thought this was a bit of a sad musical, this wasn't as upbeat as the first one, but don't get me wrong i still enjoyed it.
I don't get why Donna Sheridan played by (Meryl Streep) has to be dead that was a bit of a disappointment for the whole movie.
The songs used in the film i loved but there not as well known which for some people will be a disappointment.
The song super trooper played at the end of the movie made it a very happy vibe like the first one, i just wished that vibe was throughout the whole movie.The actors in this movie played amazing, loved them all.",Mamma Mia! Here We Go Again

It's definately a film to watch to wind down to. Very enjoyable",Mamma Mia! Here We Go Again

I went to see Here We Go Again to the cinema, and left with a weird, pleasant sensation on my chest. I was thrilled and happy when I got there and left with a fulfilling feeling.
Every Mamma Mia fan will appretiate this for what it is.
It will NEVER be as good as the original, it will never pretend to be A GREAT NEW MUSICAL, no. Because Benny and Bjorn (From ABBA, the directors and producers), didn't make this movie three or four years after the first one.
They made this movie exactly 10 Years after, as a tribute.
And it's a beautiful one, that I feel everyone will enjoy :)",Mamma Mia! Here We Go Again
570,dorotapalubiak,Very disappointing,4,16 March 2019,"Mamma Mia was entertaining, fresh and really pleasant to watch. This one... I regret I watched it, spoiled the whole experience.
I get the idea was to show Donna's young years and how she ended up on the Kalokairi. But how she found this island in the first place?
Then the singing and dancing... It resembles Bollywood movies. And what exactly was the point of adding Sophie's grand mother played by Cher? She doesn't bring anything to the whole movie.
Screenplay is weak and most characters flat. Amanda Seyfried's talent got fully wasted in this movie, similarly to other good actors.
I'm really sad Mamma Mia's magic is gone",Mamma Mia! Here We Go Again

575,s-29206,Best for Last,10,21 January 2020,"Inspired by the music of ABBA and set on a beautiful Croatian island, the second ""Mamma Mia!"" is the tastiest Croation pastry with the sweetest piece of poticia on the side. I mean this in the best way, the sequel includes more characters and more of a history than we got from the first movie. It's sure to get you a sweet high.Set In 1979, young Donna (Maryl Streep), Tanya (Christine Baranski) and Rosie (Julie Walters) graduate from college. Being a free spirit, Donna goes on an adventure, which turns out to be a series of fun trips throughout Europe. Throughout her many excursions, she becomes romantically involved with three men, Harry, Bill and Sam. However, young Donna falls the hardest for Sam, who is actually engaged and breaks her heart. In the first movie, the audience realizes that Sam is the father of Donna's daughter, Sophie. Now- fast forward to the present day, Donna has died and her daughter Sophie (Amanda Seyfried), dreams of re-opening the hotel her mother once owned. She named it ""Donna-Bella"" in honor of her mother. She invited everyone to the grand opening reuniting with friends and family on the Croatian island.In my expertise film opinion, this movie provides the audience with a fun music, good humor, and plenty of action that makes you want to get off the couch and sing. Many of the actors in this movie have gotten several awards. The overall theme is that family and friends are important and we shouldn't ever take them for granted, which is something important to be reminded of.Directed by Ol Parker, Parker wanted to have dialogue and script in a leapfrog effect going from past to present. Parker also wanted to include moments from the first movie in which the audience can go back and relate to. He included many of the original songs and catch phrases relating to the band ABBA - a Swedish band popular in the 1970s. Many of the actors also remained the same, so the audience can see how the characters have grown and changed throughout the ten year difference in which the sequel came out. The duration of the movie is also quite similar to the first and it's the perfect time where you won't get bored and fall asleep. It will keep you singing on your toes the entire time. The setting on the Croatian helps emphasize the culture. This movie is unique in terms of the costumes and makeup the actors wear. However, with a modern touch since it is placed 10 years later since the first movie. I liked how he kept many of these things the same so that the audience can go back and remember the tiny moments from the first movie.However, some things are different, the cinematography is exceptionally better. It's more clear and there are more angles than the first movie. The audience will be able to tell they out time and effort into the editing. This is because the technology has gotten better. Overall Mama Mia has five stars and : oh oh, how can anyone resist it?",Mamma Mia! Here We Go Again

578,minifie-1,A few loose ends,7,27 July 2018,"It was OK. Rather oddly the Torbay audience applauded at the end - something rare outside London. However Donna appeared to be something of a tart having sex with three strangers within a week and, if she opened the hotel shortly after arriving on the island and stayed there, how come she and her friends supposedly enjoyed a successful pop career ? Would have liked to have known what killed Meryl Streep's Donna. Very jolly and enjoyable nonetheless and, as in the first film, the women - notably James and Seyfried, were far better singers than the men. Love Hugh Skinner normally but the excellent choreography on 'Waterloo' seemed to be a deliberate distraction from his less than top-notch vocals. Jeremy Irvine, on the other hand, has a good voice and should have been given more to do. And what happened to Harry's boyfriend ?",Mamma Mia! Here We Go Again

The timeline of events from who Donna meets first, then the fact that it's set in 1979 when Sophie is born, Sophie is 20 in the first Film making it based in 1999 and now she's 25 so it would be 2004 yet everyone has modern technology and iPhones?

I am not a fan of ABBA and yet I discovered a fully enjoyable film with great songs and a nice enough story.I was expecting something alike in this tittle. It is not what I watched.The first thing that let me down was how they completely ignored the statements about the three boys and how Donna (Meryl Streep) meets them and eventually has her ""what a night"" (which precise dates are read by Sophie (Amanda Seyfried) and are ignored) with them. From that, it could only go worst. I could forgive the fact that the boys were not portrayed at all like they were in the first movie, but it was another symptom that they had thrown away everything they had stated in the previous film. From that, only a never-ending list of song barely sung one after another with no reason or purpose.What I consider the ""main plot"", which is Sophie being away from Skye and pregnant with the fear of being a single mother like Donna was before, isn't even properly taken care of, just a couple of songs and a happy ending with him returning to the loving arms of his wifey. Besides, her two friends who should be helping her have magically disspeared and are replaced by her mother's friends.To end it, add to the mix some cliché comments about how bad men are (when the guys depicted in the films couldn't be more characterless) and you have a perfect waste of money in the cinema.At least I liked some of the songs. And I like the cast, it's not their fault.",Mamma Mia! Here We Go Again

Does Hollywood think, or just hope, their viewing audience is not smart enough to notice the disparities? In addition to the plot being inaccurate, it falls very short of expectations. I love musicals but believe the music is supposed to enhance the story not completely replace it. There was very little dialogue, no meaningful dialogue, between the films characters. My last complaint is the choice to add Cher and Andy Garcia. I mean, seriously, WTF? Even if they wanted to introduce Sophie's grandmother, choosing Cher for this part is beyond rediculous. Then to cast Andy as her partner? Neither add anything to the story line so I cannot imagine the reason they were brought into the film. Did someone loose a bet? Now, putting all the negative to the side, I must say that Lily James was fantastic! Not only does she have an amazing voice, she portrayed Donna perfectly.

That set me up in a bad mood for the rest of the film. and 2.To have more recognisable ABBA songs (could have used the same songs). It wasn't as upbeat as the first film so dragged in places.

614,hegnergeorgia,Whatever this is it's not Mamma Mia!,1,22 July 2018,"I am supremely disappointed by this movie. Not only did it not live up to the expectation of Mamma Mia! But it actually ruined the happy ending of the first movie. I went in to the theater in a pretty sad mood wanting a little fun and uplifting, and I wrongly assumed Mamma Mia! 2 would be a safe bet. It's unfortunate because the musicial numbers were fun and stunning. The actors playing the young versions were wonderful. I loved seeing how Donna met the guys. But the whole thing was watched under the shadow of 
(SPOILERS)
Donna being dead. We never found out how, which wouldn't have made it any better. That whole plot point was obviously a cheep and lazy attempt to pull some emotion into the movie and was completely unnecessary and didn't actually contribute any conflict. AND it took away from the spirit of what Mamma Mia! is. On top of this they didn't honor what Mamma Mia! established. Donna stated that her mom was dead, but now she is alive, apparently just so Cher can sing one (albeit great) song.Harry and Donna's story got cut short (that's a little pun from one of the funniest characters in the second movie) we saw Harry and Donna meet and ... in Paris but as we heard in Honey Honey he was supposed to ""show up out of the blue"" after Bill for Donna to show him the island and more ...ing. This never happened. Harry saw Donna sailing off with Bill when he tried to follow her and just walked off dejectedly. I kept waiting for him to show back up but alas was disappointed again. Bill apparently cheated on Rosie, which I kept expecting them to explain away as a misunderstanding. Which apparently it wasn't. This totally changed the way I think about Bill AND Rosie as she got back together with him. This movie had enough conflict with us seeing Donna's story firsthand with her ups and downs, and Sophie's struggles with reopening the hotel and finding out she was pregnant. Messing around withe the intended ending from the first movie and making negative changes to the pressent day was unnecessary and poor/uninventive writing. It did not actually make a positive contribution to how interesting the movie was and didn't live up to the personality of the fist movie of which the main conflict was which of three men was Sophie's father. A kooky and light mystery with a fulfilling resolution. Donna's death does not meet this standard.Whatever this is it's not Mamma Mia!",Mamma Mia! Here We Go Again
615,zhangzheng0529-405-585724,My youth memory-----here we go again.,7,20 July 2018,"I thought this is just a rehash of the 2008 movie but after watching the movie I would call out one thing: they really put in efforts into it. As the newly-added elements in this sequel, the young versions of six leads particularly, the newly graduated Donna had a eye-dazzling performance. The plot unfolds in a way interlocking with each detail given away in the conversations of the original screenplay. Maybe I should have conjured every scene here up in 10 years ago but this sequel really serves as a good testament to jolly wishful and vibrant young Donna being an innocent lady fallen into three serendipitous and romantic loves rather than a putative slut in some evil minds by any chance if this sequel had never been shot. 
When I heard the classic quote "" life is short, the world is wide. I want to make some memories"", it really struck my heart and invoked the sweet moments of my adolescence. As much as I got a ticket for the original 10 years ago even after watching the Broadway stage show, today I just want a mindless, escapist and entertaining night to reminisce some old unforgettable recollection of myself.

I thought Meryl Streep was going to be in the movie a lot more than she was but the story is so well done and keeps you interested throughout the entire movie. Cher was awesome but being that she was only three years older than Meryl it was a little hard to believe. She still has a great voice and it was so good to see her in the movies again. The young actors stole the show and were very well casted. I am so happy that all the originals returned for this movie. They all ;looked like they were having a lot of fun.

Truly a bad sign.
Two hours and thirty nine too many long minutes later I left, tryly disapointed.

They looked a little bit dressed too modern for that time and they don't look at all like their counterparts in the first movie (thank goodness!) And mr. Brighton? It's Bright, Harry Bright! Less famous ABBA songs indeed, but no less touching. 
From the start there's a wonderful sense of joy. I really liked the singing and performances of Lily James and Amanda Seyfried.

This is just so bland. The biggest problem for me with this movie is that it doesn't convay any emotions. When a character in the movie supposedly goes through a hard time, I just don't feel anything, they are not even trying to make you feel something. For example, when a character goes through a break up, you would think I should feel sad, but no... Its just gonna be a nice little song and then the next scene everything is fine. I just feel like none of the characters go through any real struggles. Also, everything is so easy in this movie. I just hate how everything is just so easy.

Most of the time it was like they just thought opps we have not sung for a while lets just put a song in here. It made no sense.
Love Abba and Love Cher but it was like a cameo at the end of the show. it made no sense again.
Anthony Garcea wondering around all movie was strange, till Cher turned up and then it was like AHHHH but what and why no a feed in the story line.And two dads and hubby not coming to the opening and the storm hit and everything was destroyed and bang everyone not invited turned up along with Hubby and Dad's - lets all sing.Most people would know 3-4 songs and tap along with the other 8 wondering what who sang them and why add them Plus the poor old chook still caring those damn twigs.So disappointment could have been amazing.",Mamma Mia!

At the cinema the audience was singing and clapping along. The movie was kind of a sequel and prequel combined. If you want a few years and a few laughs and a sing a long then this movie is for you.

She in no reason needed to be in this movie. It made absolutely no sense and ruined it. It tried to be the Cher show in the last 15 min which was real dumb. Also, not sure why they killed Donna off esp. since Meryl Streep was in the movie. Besides that Lily James was fantastic. She pulled off Young Donna. The same swagger, and sexiness and rock star type free spirit vine we all love. The other Characters were well cast. Especially Donnas Suitors. I mean dang who wouldn't make the same decisions as Donna faced with an incredible week like that with those three? Best week of your whole life! It makes you understand why there were three guys.

This movie is not any of the types of movies mentioned above. It doesn't have the best cinematography, the best special effects or the suspense that make you dangle from your seat.What this movie will bring you are true emotions. Through acting, singing and dancing this young and talented cast will take you through an emotional rollercoaster (there is nothing wrong with the elderly actors - but the young STARS stole the show). As all the other reviewers I have to mention the acting of Lily James - phenomenal!The music in the movie was extraordinary! All of the songs were very planned and they were put into the movie at the time of need.Last but not least - the dads. I've seen a lot of 'complaints' about their part in the movie, but I have to say that their characters add some comedy via sweet dad moves and mediocre singing.While watching the movie I felt happy, sad, angry, lonely and strong; and through the brilliant acting of Lily James I felt that pretty much everything is possible with a glimpse of hope and determination.

Second of all, Donna says someone has got it in for her, that her mother WAS a ray of sunshine as If she's dead. Then she appears in the second movie, like she's awoken from the life of the dead? Third, you get to see a photo of Donna when she meets Sam, Harry and Bill, none of them has the style in the second movie simular to the costumes they have in the pictures in the first movie. And Sam is supposed to announce that he's engaged, not that Donna sees his picture and runs away. There's so much in the second movie that doesn't add up.",Mamma Mia! Here We Go Again

As the first movie they have some songs that basically they have to used like Dancing Queen and fernando was like forced in the plot with that small story but that didnt took the charm of the movie, I spend most of the movie smiling and well its a musical so if the music is good, that's a very important fact about it. The plot was just a backstory most of the time but something that is so true is the meaning, everything Donna did was for her dreams and even though she couldn't do everything its not true since she created the base for the future of her daughter something that I personally relate with my life so I loved this movie for that, even more than mamma mia.

646,hollygtemple,It had its ups and downs!,6,22 July 2018,"Overall I think that the film wasn't that bad however there were factors that let it down. The continuity for me was a huge let down, being a huge fan of the first film, some of the flashbacks in the movie contradict what the first movie set in place. Now this is very personal but I think killing the character of Donna off was a huge mistake! She was the heart and balls of the first movie and removing her presence from the second movie meant the film lacked the warmth and quirkiness that Meryl Streep bought to the original and the fact the cause of her death isn't even addressed makes this worse. Saying this, Lily James was the saving grace of this film capturing the role of a young Donna perfectly with a beautiful singing voice to match, her rendition of I Have a Dream particularly standing out. I did enjoy the flashbacks of Donna and the three guys surprisingly, even though Hugh Skinner was too try hard to be Colin Firth and took over Pierce Brosnan being the worse singer. Harry and Donna were odd but quirky as expected, Bill and Donna were fiery and deep again as expected but best of all Sam and Donna's chemistry was electric and instant and very well matched what was established in the original film. Julie Walters stood out as usual for her excellent comedic timing and joined by Christine Baranski for Angel Eyes was a pleasant nostalgic vibe from the previous film and had the catchy lyrics and energy to get it stuck in your head!! However the rest of the present day story lacked warmth as I previously mentioned, Amanda Seyfried struggled to carry the films story and lacked emotion unless she was bouncing off bold characters like Rosie and Tanya or even Donna at the end. Cher was the biggest disappointment of the film for me, purely there for a money grab to entice audiences; whilst having a fantastic voice that I cannot fault, she doesn't seem to act and her character lacks depth making the last part of the film feel extremely rushed and just random really. Even though the biggest mistake of the film was killing off Meryl Streep's character, I do have to comend this by saying if it had to be done this was the best way to do it with My Love, My Life being so touching and emotional giving the film some finesse and raw emotion! My favourite number in the whole film. Overall not a bad film but the faults are big and cannot be avoided by ABBA's great hits or some sad story. Side note; trailers did an awful job, advertised completely the wrong way and should have focused more on what the film was actually about rather than focusing on Sophie's pregnancy which isn't even mentioned till the last 40 minutes of the film at least.",Mamma Mia!

However,it is still a good movie to me,for its scenes and techs.
(really a shame Meryl Streep didnt play a bigger part,and why she is still in the middle of the poster???)",Mamma Mia! Here We Go Again

652,adie000,Absolutely amazing!,10,19 July 2018,As a true fan of Mamma Mia I didn't miss the chance to watch Mamma Mia! Here We Go Again in the very first of its release. I loved it. It met my high expectations as I was expecting many things. They joy that this film gave me is undescribable. The songs are great and they match with the film as the story unfolds. The flashback to the young age of Donna is a really smart idea and Lilly James had the amazing spirit of Meryl Streep and she was great. I really enjoyed it and I recommend this film to anyone!,Mamma Mia! Here We Go Again

The Actors did an amazing job and I don't think there was a dry eye left in the cinema! people even gave applause at the end. Would pay to go and see it again!

660,yulykoprivec,Overrated,3,17 October 2018,"Watched the movie for only about 45 minutes. It was boring and definetly overrated, the storyline was just all over the place. I mean, girl leaves town, meets a man, leaves that town, meets another random man, leaves again and guess what, meets another man when she finds a random horse in a basement, all in the span of around 20 minutes. All the while, her future daughter is opening a hotel in that same house her mum found that horse in, her man's on the other side of the planet, the mum actually already died (not sure if it even says the reasons why) so they're all sad AND then, a day before opening the hotel a storm comes and destroys it all. The characters are just not well developed in my opinion, as a viewer i can say i just couldn't connect to any character because the story was just jumping all over the place. But that's just my opinion.",Mamma Mia! Here We Go Again
661,moonmerc,Utter confusion,1,19 September 2018,"Ok so I feel compelled to write a review as I just don't understand this film. I went along with friends who loved the first one (for transparency, the only musical I've ever actually liked is the original Producers). This film made me feel...empty inside...is the best I can describe it. But is it me? Spoiler alerts from this point.Ok so if I followed right this is the story of a girl who ends up on a Greek island, after hooking up with three blokes, one of whom she is quite sweet on but who it turns out is unavailable. At the same time this story is paralleled by that of her future grown up daughter (first girl sadly no longer with us) on same Greek island planning the opening of a hotel in her mother's honour. Ok so far so life (well one which revolves around a Greek island). But these people - they are not...well...human? So future grown up girl argues with fella who wants to stay in NY, she is building a legacy to her dead mom whom she loved dearly, and the parallel story shows her mum leave school, head off on adventure, hook up with 3 boys (one out of pity, one cos she's trapped on a boat with him and he's ok and one she genuinely likes who upsets her a lot), and end up living in a derelict shack on this island while her two best friends go back to their lives. And both women plus all support characters play these plot lines of loss and adventure like they're children who are pretending to be grown-ups in a strange version of the adult world where everyone is on enough sugar to get through the day but not so much they actually like it. It was, well...pointless...But when I came out of the cinema there were other women crying in the bathroom because it moved them to tears, so maybe I am a bit dead inside...(or at least totally out of touch with the norms and values popular culture)...",Mamma Mia!

Didn't like their music then as my tastes ran towards Uriah Heep and Deep Purple. However, I now realize it was because I didn't like Disco. This movie is clever and clarifies the original.

Cher was OK but not great, maybe not enough screen time to make her shine. Lily James was wonderful, but did not look at all like Meryl Streep. I think they could have found a better young Donna. All the young fathers were wonderful in their own unique way. This was such an up beat movie that I could not come down for quite a while afterwards. Definitely worth going to the movies.",Mamma Mia!

669,llewis-14807,"I Worry For Those Folks Who Like ""MM2""",2,2 September 2018,"Perhaps others on here have used a variation of what follows as my review of MM2...if so, it bears repeating: ""That's 1 hour, 54 minutes of my life I'll never get back.""This is a god-awful exploitative rape of the original movie, save for Streep's scene near the end, which was surprisingly beautifully handled. If you so enjoyed the original as I had, may I advise you to stay away from this movie at all costs, lest your positive image of the franchise be forever tarnished. After seeing MM2, I came away strongly disliking the young Donna....and that takes some doing!Making my way back through the bowels of my local cineplex, one song kept running through my mind, only it wasn't an ABBA tune. It was Steve Miller's, ""Take The Money And Run."" Obviously, this film's creators used THAT song as its penultimate plot driver. And that's a real shame, when I contemplate what this movie could have been.",Mamma Mia! Here We Go Again
670,yazanabuloz-43568,Not what I expected!!!,10,20 July 2018,"When I read that there will be another film for mamma Mia, i was worried that it will not be fun and excited as the original and what else they can add or what song they will play. Until I watched it today, the film is really wonderful, even better than the first one in weird way. 
I didn't expect that at all I was laughing and singing all the time. One thing that was disappointed that the trailer spoiled the film, I wish if that didn't happened. I can't wait to watch it again lol",Mamma Mia! Here We Go Again
671,sine_malu,Too many mistakes,3,6 June 2020,"Clearly nobody has seen the first movie, Mamma Mia!, including the director and cast. Nothing makes sense story wise according to the information we get in the first movie. First of all Donna implies in the first movie that her mother is dead but in the second movie, in present time, she is very much alive. Second of all, when Sophie reads Donnas diary in the first movie we learn that Donna met the three possible fathers in this order, Sam, Bill and Harry but in this sequel Donna mets Harry first then Bill and last Sam. Third of all, in the first movie we see pictures of Donna, Sam, Bill and Harry as young but in the sequel they look nothing like their pictures. I could have overlooked this as the movie probably wouldn't sell at all if there weren't any handsome young men in the movie, but it still bothers me...",Mamma Mia! Here We Go Again

673,mckennaburns,Disappointing!! (SPOILERS BELOW!),1,4 August 2018,"I have to agree with many of the other reviews here. The movie was a TOTAL DISAPPOINTMENT to me. I was hoping for an uplifting happy movie with recognisable Abba songs to merrily sing/hum along to along the lines of the really entertaining and uplifting original Mama Mia movie. However, the movie has barely begun when the viewer realises that the wonderful Donna (who to me embodies the heart and soul of the whole story) is actually dead. What a plotline disaster!! (It was nice to see Meryl popping up as a ghost to sing an Abba tune in the latter moments of the movie though. Maybe it was actually the movie's only saving grace as I felt the screen lit up with her presence). It was obvious that Meryl was brought in to lighten the overall gloomy tone. I think the director made a grevious mistake in making this a weepie. Its should've been a light hearted fun escapist type of movie like the original from which one comes away with a smile on ones face!! Instead, I could detect the sounds of quiet sobbing going on all around me in the cinema! Granted, all the cast are terrific but the disappointing storyline ruined it for me.",Mamma Mia! Here We Go Again
674,katy_charlton,Never been so disappointed.,2,22 July 2018,"I've waited months to see this. I love Abba and I loved the first movie but this just felt like a money grabbing cop-out.
In short, the movie was down-right miserable with the current day cast all being completely maudlin over Donna's death. The songs were lackluster, the plot had more holes than a lump of cheese and the laughs were few.
The only saving grace to this movie was the fabulous double act that are Christine Baranski and Julie Walters who stole every scene they were in.
I'm hugely disappointed by this dreadful follow-up. We came out feeling empty and depressed.",Mamma Mia! Here We Go Again

This musical never was suppose to be compared to the 1st Mamma Mia it is a stand alone presentation. Musicals look for an excuse to sing and dance which is done well in this movie. If you never saw the 1st one you could still follow the intentions of the movie. Mamma Mia Here We Go Again is just a different interpretation of the same facts and is just supposed to be enjoyed for what it is not ripped apart by self proclaimed purists. Good grief do you people enjoy anything?,Mamma Mia! Here We Go Again
682,paulsullivanuk,Trying to hard?,6,2 August 2018,"A few goofs with this film. The graduation scene set in England, graduates do not wear their mortar boards inside . The film was overlong and dipped in the middle, trying to show the previous story catch up. The young lookalikes were really good and the young Donna was exceptional. Just as I thought it was going to bomb as a sequel, along comes Meryl Streep as a ghost who absolutely stole the whole film in the last ten minutes, what a talent, wonderful. Cher still a great singing voice , but so heavily made up, could have been given more to do. Scenery and photography wonderful. Would I watch it again? Only for the last ten minutes with Meryl Streep. It sèemed to lack sparkle some how and showed a great division between the older and younger generation of actors.",Mamma Mia! Here We Go Again
683,cathyflk,Truly truly awful,1,4 January 2019,"A purely sell out movie for those people who usually enjoy the True Movie channel and always like a happy (but a little nostalgic) ending. Lily James has just one expression throughout and asking the audience to 'believe' that Cher is Meryl Streep's mother is beyond stupidity. If you like predictable Hollywood mush that spoon feeds your every emotion you will LURVE this! If you, like me, wonder why people want their buttons pressed so hard then avoid - I mistakenly accompanied my daughter who kind of liked the first one as I would not have handed over my money to Bjorn and Benny so readily otherwise. Cher has all the grace of a patient just recovering from bilateral hip replacements and her so smooth skin is work of art that will have octogenarians rushing to see their plastic surgeons.",Mamma Mia!

689,loubelouuk,Watch it twice or more... To get the full beauty of the story,10,25 August 2018,"When I saw this for the first time I must say that I wasn't blown away, I liked the story of how young a Donna met Sam, Bill & Harry but changes are always a bit strange and there were some songs I'd never heard of! But then there were also some real 80's crackers that your never usually hear on mainstream radio like 'whats the name of the game' with its big moody beat and 'Angel eyes', brilliantly & hysterically sing as a duet by Rosie & Tanya - which I loved from back when I was a young teen. But I went back to watch with another friend and that's when I started to fall in love with all the new characters, and the newer songs too. Lily James is incredible as the young Donna, beautiful both in herself and her voice, & also funny and sweet. Her voice really made the hairs stand up on the back of my neck for a few songs she is so good. I read up about the new songs and found out that some are b sides and one was only released in South America (I think) but they are all old ABBA songs, not new ones. Also I realised straight away that the filming location was not Greece, which is a real shame because for me - a real Greece lover - because I felt that part of the charm of the first film was that the location was so pure and unspoilt showing the true Greece of my childhood visits. But for any doubters or disappointed fans I would say give it another chance. Watch it again and you will grow to love all the characters and the story more. I've seen it 4 times now lol!

I was super excited for this one and even though I knew Cher would be in it(like her but she is not old enough to play donnas mother) I went and saw it in theaters. I am just disappointed, I think they just wanted to make a movie but they couldn't really find the music to go with it. They used all the best songs in the first movie. The story line was strange and they had to make it fit the music. Usually music make the movie better but I was dreading it every time they would play another song. I think they should have just stuck with the first movie. There were some good parts and I absolutely loved the cast and the acting.probably won't watch it again and I recommend you wait until it comes out on dvd to watch.",Mamma Mia! Here We Go Again

Great idea to tell the back story of Donna (Meryl Streep's character from the original). I don't understand negative feedback on it at all it was such a happy movie.

For what it was filmed for (feel good easy to watch film, or for fans of abba) it does really well. I personally preferred this to the first film due to the fact i still dislike sophie as a character and a lot of this film is in the past (which btw, all the past characters are great, good singing/acting) where she thankfully doesnt exist yet. At the end of the day if you like abba, and are willing to forsake any self respect for the next 1hour 54minutes, then you will enjoy this film. However cher makes a cameo and they break canon to create a new character for 10 minutes JUST so they can fit in one more song, sorry but this lowered the review by 1 star I mean ffs guys why are you making it so hard to just enjoy you? Not to mention its not a great song (sorry abba).",Mamma Mia! Here We Go Again

The mix of new songs and the original classics from the first movie created a beautiful blend of music. The blissful Mediterranean vibes of the whole film left the viewer with a warm feeling and a big smile.

Okay first, in this movie the story line is nothing. and I'm 100% sure they're just making all these jumbled out scenes as an excuse to carry out the songs. So I would advise you to go to see this movie with no high expectations for storyline. 
However, this is a musical..and Lily James is a winner, and Meryl Streep shall be proud! and I am thrilled, delighted, pleased and excited!
I would definitely watch it again in the cinema just to hear them on surround sound system and watching them sing and dance so beautifully is a wonderful entertainment on its own. it truly feels like you just went on vacation and when you get home, all you want is just to go back again immediately!Sure we get to know more about Donna and how she came to be.
But really, if we're being totally honest, we're only here to enjoy Lily James, Amanda Seyfriend, Meryl Streep and the gangs (and Cher!) sing Abba!! and they are awesome!!",Mamma Mia! Here We Go Again

Bill just seemed horny and Sam just wanted a fun summer fling it seemed. Eventually, Donna seemed to discover she was pregnant way later when the time period where she slept with them was 2/3 weeks. Idk, it was just a big old mess. The reopening of the Bella Donna hotel seemed very important in the beginning, but that went right out the window when the flashbacks began.

715,doane-43142,Wow,1,2 August 2018,This movie was horrible compared to the first one. I watched the first one the night before and was happy and laughing throughout the movie. Then i went to see this and I was depressed. If you watched the first i would recommend skipping this movie because you won't have a great time. Save your money.,Mamma Mia! Here We Go Again

718,buketizbat,Mother's daughter,10,21 July 2018,"I loved it. I had to much fun while I am watching it, music, dance, happiness, sadness it's all in that movie. I honestly loved the casting, all of them are talented actors and actresses. I especially loved the young fathers, young Donna, Rosie and Tanya. It was as good as the first movie. I strongly reccomend it if you like music, dance and comedies. By the way I think the ending was incredably awesome.When I see that the whole cast singing and dancing together in the end, it reminded me that we all live with younger ourselfs, even if we get old it would be still us. I think it was one of the messages in that movie. I loved it, definitely, wanna see it again.",Mamma Mia! Here We Go Again
719,BradleyMartin12,A surprisingly good follow up,7,24 July 2018,"10 years after the first Mama Mia! Here We Go Again didn't come by surprise, but what did was it actually being good. I truly believe it's superior to the original, leaving out the slow pacing of the first, having the film go back and forth between young Donna and hotel renovating Sophie, I think the pace benefited from the big decision. With Meryl Streep being absent people leading up to movie we're freaking out, but the movie took a problem and turned it into a solution, by having Streep appear at the end of the film. The film although cheesy, is a lot of fun, and a must see for any fan of the original.",Mamma Mia! Here We Go Again

722,bluegreenandred,Pointless movie,2,22 July 2018,They did not need to make another one. The first was super good and I was excited to see the second one. I was very disaspointed. The story line just seemed to go nowhere and was pointless. Not to mention the best character is only in there ten mins.,Mamma Mia! Here We Go Again
723,margozubova,Here we go again: a total disappointment.,2,22 July 2018,"First Mamma Mia, even if not the greatest movie ever, is my forever favourite, so I was very excited to watch the second part ever since it was announced. Sadly, I was disappointed from the first few seconds, when it became clear that Donna was dead - something that was done out of poor taste in order to create a sad backdrop for the second part, when they could have made it better and more complex by actually having Donna in it. The entire scene of graduation in Oxford just set the bad-taste tone for the whole movie going forward. Apparently, in a need of a story writers locked themselves in for 5 days to come up with it and it seems as such, everything is rushed, million plot holes, things do not add up. Donna's mother is dead in the first part, the way Donna meets Harry, Sam and Bill is totally different to original, characters are nothing but cliches and used to comedic purpose more than anything. If in the first part songs created a story, this time around it was just random singing of third tier ABBA songs to make money off the famous names. Everything is either overly comic or overly dramatic, but in a bad taste, rather than tasteful. While it was nice to see the original cast, it feels like they were there just to mourn Donna, while young cast just didn't get properly written characters. Not even gonna say anything about Cher - she was just a big name for audience attraction and her dumb character did not deliver on anything. Did not believe her one bit and its a shame that they wasted such a good actor Andy Garcia just for the name Fernando. Mamma Mia 2 is nothing but a money making excuse of a film. The only scene I actually did enjoy was closing song, knowing that I get to go home after it.Shame. I love Mamma Mia but this was a complete disservice to the original.",Mamma Mia! Here We Go Again

727,bethanygraham-05970,Loved it!,8,24 July 2018,"I thought Mamma Mia! Here We Go Again was a great watch. It was funny, feel good and emotional during various scenes - a bit of an emotional rollercoaster. The cast was delightful, and I really enjoyed the storyline and how well linked it was to the first film. Definitely worth a watch! No preference of either the first or second film, I have enjoyed both of them and I'll look forward to this coming out on DVD.",Mamma Mia! Here We Go Again
728,karen_oglesbee,not what was hoped for,5,25 July 2018,I like the first film and we looked forward to the second. It has some funny bits but overall has lost the feel good factor expected. The first half was very slow and it jumps too much between times. The songs aren't as well known which doesn't help. There was really no need for the loss part could have just had donna away somewhere and flown in with cher at the end. The plus part was super trooper as it felt like the first film's happy vibe as I hoped the whole film would.,Mamma Mia! Here We Go Again
729,jacksongabby,Not a half bad movie,5,25 July 2018,"Lily James (playing young donna) did a good job playing her part, even though playing young Meryl Streep is a difficult task. The best parts of the movie were the past parts in my opinion because they did great casting they with young Rosie (Alexa Davies), and young Tanya (Jessica Keenan Wynn). The past bits were filled with classic fun abba songs, but I think they rushed most of young Donna relationships. They spent like five minutes with one guy and then 10 on the next. This made no sense to me because some of the present parts of the movies, with Sophie (Amanda Seyfried) were slow and depressing without Donna (Meryl Streep.) Over all I think they could of developed more of the young men characters ecspecially harry. Although the best present parts were with Rosie (Julie Walters), and Tanya (Christine Barankski) who kept me laughing though all of their parts. The worst part of the movie was the random entrance of Cher. She didn't make much sense in the storyline of the movie, and when she tried to steal the show it ruined everything. I'd have to say she ruined Mama Mia 2 with her singing witch sounded like constant yawning, and made me mad that she was in it more than Donna thanks Cher you made my rating from a 7 to a 5.",Mamma Mia!

Although emotional underlying themes, I had great fun watching it and left with a smile on my face.

It is a great film and a great tonic.

Right from the first five minutes your filled with regret at the thought that you spent 12$ to watch this film in theatres. Even the original mamma Mia was slightly cheesy but this was movie was really poorly done all around. Transitions into each song was akward, the writing was poorly done, cheesy and it felt closer to the greatest showman than the original mamma Mia movie. Tons of plot holes and terrible one liners. I really missed the Greek cast of extras. Instead it looked like they took a bunch of American college extras too party and dance around. The costumes and furniture looked like you could buy stuff from modern day stores. I can say the story line was fun to see the background story to Donnas life, but they could have done a much better job on this movie and overall I was very disappointed and probably will only watch the original mamma Mia going on forward.",Mamma Mia! Here We Go Again
736,bacongirl-97727,Better than the first!,8,30 July 2018,"The actors were all amazing, the people reprising roles have had time to improve, and it shows, and the younger cast brought a lot of energy to an already energetic ride! Lily James especially shone, I loved her in Baby Driver and she was even better here! The flashbacks were entertaining, as well as provided some well-needed character development! My only complaint was the choice they made with older Donna, as it felt very out of left wing. I'm by no means a critic, but as a general audience member, I loved it!!!",Mamma Mia! Here We Go Again
737,nathaliesafatly,Cried the whole movie,7,31 July 2018,Definitely a great movie. Not as magical as the first but it's explains a lot about donna. But and a huge but if you lost recently a parent don't watch it or at least go with a pack of tissues. I cried and weeped like a baby the whole time. So emotional it killed me. I left drained and so sad although the movie is supposed to be a happy one. Why in the name of God would they kill donna's character?!!!,Mamma Mia! Here We Go Again
738,stephaniedaniellelopez,Get your facts right !,9,31 July 2018,"The movie was great, I just had a minor issue with it and that was the fact that some things didn't match with the first movie. In the first Mamma Mia, during Honey, Honey Sophie reads Donna's diary and there it says she met Sam first. Then Bill and Harry. Also Sam was the one to show her the island. In the new movie she meets Harry first followed by bill then Sam. Another thing is that in the first movie at the end of Chiquita Donna tells Rosie and Tonya about also being with Bill and Harry after being with Sam and they never knew about that. However in the new one Tonay and Rosie meet Bill when according to the first one they never knew about him. Overall though, I do believe that it was a good movie definitely a must see.",Mamma Mia!

This has now been added to my list of favourite musicals ever. If you liked the first film then this is a must. Without giving too much away there are two storylines, one reverts back to the young Donna arriving on the island, and the other is all about her daughter Sophie. In my opinion this is better than the first Mama Mia and a film I could watch time and time again.",Mamma Mia! Here We Go Again
741,sarah_patston,Brilliant! Fun & beautifully done!,10,2 August 2018,"I didn't have high hopes for this sequel but thought it would at least be enjoyable. However, I was just bowled over by it! Fantastic writing, past and present merged thoughtfully. Made me laugh, made me cry, made the time fly by so fast! I'm shocked by the negative reviews I've seen. This isn't meant to be a deep Shakespearean tragedy, it's a musical!!! A musical with so much more! This is a feel good, fun, absorbing, (at times emotional!) great watch! Ignore the miserable old bores that slated this, watch and enjoy!!!",Mamma Mia! Here We Go Again
742,ahmadad-98461,Mamma Mia what a Disaster,6,3 August 2018,"This return was good but could have been better. The story was interesting, because it showed us the past of Donna that we did not see in the first one. The unnoticeable transition between Donna's life and the present story really kept the flow. Why I gave the seven was basic atmosphere present in ""Dancing queen"" sequence and Cher's moment. The Dancing queen sequence was not as epic as the first once. It could have been way better, the dialogue present in the dancing and the singing ruined the mood for me. It would have been entertaining if the hugs and kisses merged with the music is some way. As for Cher's scene, that was the biggest disaster, it wasn't Cher, it was the choreography, the green screen and fireworks really dropped the movie from an 8 to a 6 for me.If the movie focused more on Donna's life and did not add as much events on the present, the movie might have been a bit better.",Mamma Mia! Here We Go Again
743,nmousy,Disappointing Mass Spectacle,2,5 August 2018,"Unfortunately, the choice of the young Donna doesn't convince. Neither the acting of Lily James nor her voice are outstanding and more songs should have been given to the beautiful and talented Amanda Seyfried.Though it was fun to hear the always uplifting Abba songs again, there were too many actors/dancers in most dance scenes, so that one hardly knew who to focus on.The choreography was uninspiring and at times looked like a flock of baby geese learning how to fly by flapping featherless would-be wings. Though it looked like the cast had fun making the movie, only a little of that translated to the viewer.So while it was semi-fun entertainment for an evening, it didn't come close to the high octaine enjoyment of the original movie.",Mamma Mia! Here We Go Again
744,acoach-09731,Loved It,9,5 August 2018,"I you liked the first one you'll really enjoy this version as well. The acting was fantastic. Lily James did an outstanding job. Cher was spectacular.

745,inbetweenthelions-96355,If I could give this flaming trash pile negative 10 you bet I would,1,5 August 2018,"I don't like musicals, but I especially don't like poorly sung/acted musical movies. I had to see this movie with a wedding party and it was truly an awful experience. I do enjoy Abba's music but this movie is most likely the worst portrayal of their music. Almost every song was sung poorly and I personally wished I'd taken earplugs with how off some of these actors sang. There was no plot, there was a fake conflict created because hollywood has no creativity left with scripts and instead of focusing on a different set of characters to create drama with they decided the old ""They were happy at first but then this comes out of no where and boy does it cause conflict for these 2!""A song every 5 minutes also aided to the murder of the plot because it's supposed to have Abba music in every scene. Half the scenes screamed it's a studio, lighting off, lack of realism etc it was just a badly made movie.There were good actors, mostly old funny characters that had brief comedic moments, then you had Cher pop up for no reason and proceed to sing and move like a live action barbie doll (it was semi terrifying)The best parts of the movies were towards the end when you had the older actors popping up and having a joke finally pop up and enjoy it. Also I loved Omid Djalili, he was great in the movie even if he only had a few scenes.If you want to watch a so bad its good movie this is 100% not for you. Watch something else anything but this movie, go watch an Adam Sandler movie. -10 Stars burn this script.",Mamma Mia! Here We Go Again

750,jcmcd-26704,Mamma Mia without the Mamma,3,10 August 2018,"Why would you bring back Mamma Mia without Momma Donna??? The first Mamma Mia revolved around Donna (Meryl Streep). She WAS the center of the Mamma Mia universe. Although she shows up at the very end of the movie--as a ""spirit"" or ""ghost"" that Sophie sees (in a very touching scene, I have to say), Donna is no longer with us. She has died and we find Sophie and Sam grieving at the hotel in Greece where Donna first made her home. Even the thought of a grand reopening didn't do much to lift my spirits; nor did the fun--if inaccurate ( based on what we learned in the first Mamma Mia movie)--flashbacks with the young Donna,her two ""Dynamo"" friends, and the young Harry, Bill, and Sam. I mean, Donna is dead, for Pete's sake!! I really needed to see Donna here again with the rest of the cast celebrating and having fun. Without here, it just wasn't the same for me and I came away feeling let-down by the whole affair. Also, the Abba songs they used for this Mamma Mia were mostly less well known--and definitely 2nd rate. The best numbers were a repeat of some of the songs that were used in the first movie. All-in-all, my recommendation would be to watch Mamma Mia again for the unadulterated joy and goofy fun that made it such a feel-good movie and skip this one.",Mamma Mia! Here We Go Again

With a film like this you have enter knowing you aren't getting an oscar winning storyline that will change your life, as that's not the kind of film it's made to be. Mamma Mia! Here We Go Again aims to be a light-hearted, feel-good film where you can watch the actors let loose and dance around to Abba songs and it hits that mark. Provided you don't enter the cinema with your expectations through the roof, this is a film that will put a smile on you face (and possibly bring you to tears as the scene where Donna and Sophia reunite briefly did to me). Stop thinking that every film has to have 300 layers of meaning to be worth a watch and enjoy this cheesy, bright movie.",Mamma Mia! Here We Go Again

It captivated the extreme beauty of motherhood and expressed the difficulties associated throughout life. The story line was just so beautiful but also very melancholy at the same time. It highlighted the extreme bond between mother and daughter. Lily James and Amanda seinfeild were both absolutely amazing but especially Lily who beautifully portrayed the young version of donna Sheridan. She had such an optimistic attitude and was so kind and funny. You watched her fall in and out of love with these three amazing men (Sam, Bill & Harry) and sing abba songs with all of them. Lily James is literally the most stunning person both inside and out and I guarantee you will fall in love with her by the end of the movie!

757,joanaamonteiro-39035,Just pure joy!!!,10,7 September 2018,"I´m not a fan of musicals and i took years to see the First Movie of Mamma Mia, i only saw months ago i decided to give it a chance. It was a pure joy, happiness and a stupid smile in my face during the whole movie.
When i saw that Mamma Mia 2 was coming i jumped of joy, because i haven´t had the need to wait 10 years for the second movie. 
I watched it 3 times in the theatres. It was a mixed of joy, happiness, laughers, sadness all at once. You basically fall in love with the 3 young versions of Donna, Bill, Harry and Sam. 
The only thing i can´t handle is that to make a second movie they had to kill Donna it was unecessary.
Lily James is an amazing singer, she really captivates the people, seriously i could watch the entire movie with only her and her 3 young boys i wouldn´t mind. And i loved how they changed the sequences from the old time and the present without missing any detail of her journey with her adventures during that summer. 
There are positive quotes in that movie, i took with me and basically are my mantra, like: ""The world is wide, life is short, i wanna make some memories"", ""The very very best things in life happen unexpectadly"" and she goes out braverly chasing her dream and deals with the consequences of her choices. 
That´s how life goes.
The songs are so positive, full of energy and i was afraid of the young boys versions couldn´t sing very well, and i was surprised. Everyone that likes Abba will like the movie and i´ll tell you it´s a wonderful experience watching in the cinemas.
If you haven´t seen yet, don´t waste more time. Go, before it goes away. There will be no more MM, i guess!.",Mamma Mia! Here We Go Again
758,NikiSargison,Absolutely Awful!,1,30 June 2020,"Absolutely terrible, such a let down. The whole back story was cheesy. In the first Mamma Mia (amazing 5 star movie) we see a small glimpse of Donna's past, Harry headbanger was a punk, in the sequel he's a gay loser with god knows what issues, I'm guessing they wanted to show he was gay, but they did it in the worst way possible, the fact they meet and he pushes her to have sex was just creepy. Sam in the back flashes was a hippy with long hair and moustache, in the sequel he's this handsome hunk with short hair, the only salvageable one is Bill, at least they got the look.
The cheesy references to the first movie were really badly portrayed, when Donna wears the dungarees, when we see where the napoleon hat comes from, and countless others. The whole hotel is also a let down, she already has the hotel in the first movie, that looks nothing like the second one, but I guess they had to change locations for some reason, also the fact they killed Donna off, at first I thought she didn't want to be in the movie, but then she's at the end.. no clue.
The only good acting is from the brilliant original cast, and Cher showing up.

After I watched it I was totally disappointed and irritated about the fact that I had wasted my time and money on such a dreadful film. They should have stopped making the following film. They should have let the 'First' Mamma Mia be the 'Last'.
However, they still have charming and lovely characters which makes me smile at some moments. Actors performed and sang very well. And also so many familiar ABBA's songs could make my parents generation go back in time.
But that's all i can say good things about it. 
So many changes of scenes between past and present distracted me.
A moving scene which was unnatural ( squeezing in moving scene to sell the film?)

The music popped and they did a Greta job for the most part of redoing the songs. The story was cute and fun. In the second... wow. Total fail. The actress who plays young Donna can't act. The young versions of all characters are boring, not great singers, and poorly acted. The timeline is screwed up and they basically threw out everything from the first movie and rewrote the events. Donna is randomly dead and we never learn why. But her mother has been resurrected and is played by Cher who apparently gave birth to Donna at 2 yrs old. Donna's friends apparently were the exact same hair, makeup, and clothes for 40 yrs cuz how else would we know who they're supposed to be portraying. Seriously, the young actresses were terrible. The redid the exact the exact same songs giving them no punch at all. BORING! This movie was painful to watch. I barely made it through just because I wanted to hear Cher sing.",Mamma Mia! Here We Go Again
768,arthurbentlin,A movie about songs,8,23 October 2018,"I have watched the second movie of mamma mia recently and here are some important topics i would like to talk about.
Surprisingly, meryl streep, who was one of the main characters in the first movie, had a sadly twist in the story, what prevented her from a appearing as much as the audience expected. In my point of view, this caused an expectation lost for most of the people who were looking forward for the movie realease.
On the other hand, the acting of the remaining characters was really good. The new songs that were written brought the ''old magic'' back.
However, despite the story's ''charm'' being lost and given space to an often coufused flashback, the film does not stop us from lauching until the belly hurts and feel like donna in her youth.",Mamma Mia! Here We Go Again
769,muhammadlaa,Very Cheerful and full of life,7,27 October 2018,The most thing i liked about this movie is the colorful screenplay and the very nice places and the songs in it .,Mamma Mia! Here We Go Again
770,sonja_kotevska,"Sorry Cher i love you, but i could not wait for you... i left and went to sleep...zzzz...",1,1 November 2018,"I was so excited MAMMA MIA Part 2. And CHER is playing to!!!
I watched MAMMA MIA HERE WE GO AGAIN, and I am very disappointed. This is not Greece than Croatia. Not that I don't love Croatia, she is beautiful, it is just that I was expecting Greece.
But it is good that Americans don't know that.
Gypsies playing in Greece , don't think so, in Greece they will probably play the buzuki.
Sorry for everyone Who watched part 1, but this is bad.
I liked the story, but than I watched mamma mia here we go again, and i was horrified. This is sad.Except good scenography and good music nothing else is even to OK.",Mamma Mia! Here We Go Again
771,robertakase,music was good not great vocals were to soft for the accomp.,6,11 December 2018,"The movie did not follow the first movie such as Harry Headbanger with no spiked collar or hair then no funky mustache on young Sam and no eye ball tattoo's on Bill Anderson these were very important items that I wanted to see. I also wanted to know why all three of them claimed that ( SUPER TROUPER) was their personal song from the first movie. Maybe balancing a crazy date between all three of them or something? or how Bill got his tattoo's? and Harry didn't look like a headbanger and when did he give Donna the guitar? but the hardest was the young Pierce Brosnan ,not only missing the funky mustache, but there was no way of selling him to grow up into Sam Carmicheal and where was the bag pipes? Whether Cher was a mistake or asset I leave to personal preference , to me she was nothing like Donna's mother in the description given in the first movie but at least she could sing. The second movie failed to hit the loud fun vibe the first one did either because the mix was bad or the singers weren't singing powerfully enough to over power the accompaniant. While other songs were just cut to short to give enough effect. If you totally disreguard the first movie or if you just listened to the music the first time and loved it and you just love ABBA it will probably be great but if you are story line geek or a trekie, star wars, fan cult you might have reservation about buying this movie my advice to people like me is rent first buy later one more adlib I hope someone reads this and remakes it with the stuff that left me asking questions from the first move I would pay extra to see that Mama Mia",Mamma Mia! Here We Go Again
772,bubblez-36981,I will never watch this film again!,1,17 December 2018,"I absolutely loved the first mamma mia, I have been looking forward to seeing this film. I'm so disappointed! I can't believe Donna is dead! This is revealed in the first 5 minutes and it totally ruined the film. The first film oozed happiness, it made you feel great. This does the opposite, the end scene in the church had me in tears. I will never watch it again.",Mamma Mia! Here We Go Again
773,Hikuin,So much autotune,1,15 August 2019,"It seems they used too much autotune - it all sounded quite boring.
Also it lacked some of the power and fun that, the first movie exuded. The one star is because of Meryl Streep's voice in the last part of the movie - she was great!",Mamma Mia! Here We Go Again
774,kattameg,Love it!!,10,22 January 2019,So much Better than the first!! And that does not happend that often.,Mamma Mia! Here We Go Again
775,jonnyfunh,"Sorry, shouldn't have bothered ...",3,10 February 2019,"To be honest this was terrible...I know it's meant to be cheesy, but the first Mamma Mia was GOOD cheesy... This isn't... It's clutching at straws, but not cheese straws.The singing is tragic, only Lily actually made a decent attempt at it until the oldies came along, I thought she was going to save the film but she couldn't do enough unfortunately.I really enjoyed the first one, watched the real film, then watched the sing-along one straight after but I nearly turned this off.",Mamma Mia! Here We Go Again
776,lme-61508,Mundane waste of your life,1,10 February 2019,"No storylineOut of key signing and awfully bad acting
Avoid this like the plague unless you enjoy flagellation
Jumping point for Cher to cover great songs badly

777,fastkartgirl,This movie traumatized me,1,21 February 2019,"I feel that I will never recover from having watched this movie. I wish I could go back in time before watching it, when I still had happy memories of the first movie. My memories are forever tarnished. The entire movie felt like a money-grab. They just made everything up. I knew it was bad the moment the movie started and I saw that they had killed off Donna. I actually stopped watching it about 30 minutes in to the movie. I came back the next day to finish it. Awful. The story timeline doesn't add up. How could this movie take place 5 years after the first movie when everyone clearly looks WAY older. Based off the timeline of the original script the main adults in the movie should still have been in their forties. You expect me to believe that Donna, a healthy woman full of life just dropped dead in her 40's after finally getting together with the love of her life? No, don't you do that to us. SHAME ON YOU ALL FOR MAKING THIS MOVIE!",Mamma Mia! Here We Go Again
