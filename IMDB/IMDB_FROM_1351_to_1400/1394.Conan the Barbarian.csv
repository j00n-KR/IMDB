0,TheLittleSongbird,One of the weakest movies of the year thus far,2,30 October 2011,"I enjoyed the 1982 Conan the Barbarian, and went into this movie not expecting a film as good but one to be entertaining. Alas, this Conan the Barbarian only has the costume and set design going for it. Everything else is pretty much a disaster. The music score is not as memorable, or as epic or as haunting. The direction has inconsistencies with the tone especially all over the map. The dialogue is cliché-ridden and as much as I am starting to dislike using the term anachronistic the term applies to me here, the story is dull and sluggish and the characterisations feel little more than stock stereotypes. The acting doesn't help, Stephen Lang has good presence but has nothing to work with. The lead on the other hand has no charisma whatsoever. Overall, disappointing and weak. 2/10 Bethany Cox",Conan the Barbarian
1,Leofwine_draca,"Derivative, mildly entertaining fantasy flick",6,15 December 2011,"As a massive Robert E. Howard fan who's read most of the original Conan stories and who loves the Schwarzenegger film version, I was eager to watch this new adaptation of the famous hero. Having just done so, I feel only one thing: disappointment. Disappointment that the film was handed over to the control of director Marcus Nispel, a man who has made only a few films (THE Texas CHAINSAW MASSACRE remake and the Friday THE 13TH remake are two of them) but whose trademark is already his inability to connect with his characters. A good director will bring the performers to life, allowing them to live and breathe within a film, but in a Nispel movie they're never more than actors acting on the screen. CONAN, unfortunately, follows this trend.Nispel isn't the only problem with this movie: the screenplay is also disappointing (the presence of three separate writers is a giveaway), a vapid exercise in cliché and formula. The producers had every option of developing one of Howard's brilliant short stories for the screen but instead come up with another bland origin story, the type of which was done better in the Schwarzenegger film anyway. To be fair, the first half isn't so bad, getting by on sheer spectacle and presence alone, but as the story progresses it begins to feel more and more artificial leading up to an anti-climatic and utterly lacklustre climax.As Conan, Jason Momoa certainly looks the part and delivers in the action stakes, which is all that's required of him. However, some acting from the supporting cast feels forced and mannered. Rachel Nichols is shortchanged indeed: she begins as a feisty, kick-ass heroine but ends up as the requisite shrieking damsel-in-distress by the finish. Stephen Lang, enjoying a career resurgence after AVATAR (I personally remember him as a bad guy in Seagal's FIRE DOWN BELW) is pretty good as the villain, although his role is underwritten (and the whole 'magic helmet' thing turns out to be a total joke). Rose McGowan is fairly embarrassing, Ron Perlman barely seen and other favourites (like hulking wrestler Nathan Jones) hidden beneath prosthetics.Still, it's not all bad, and often I found it mildly enjoyable, even if it was a far cry from what I'd initially hoped. The action scenes are well mounted and fluidly shot, although Conan only gets to face one slightly effective foe (the sand demons). The visuals are wonderful and the special effects for the most part grand, so at least it's a film that looks good. It's not a patch on Arnie's CONAN, though.",Conan the Barbarian
2,SnoopyStyle,Blood splattering brutality lost in a long meandering story,5,14 December 2013,"Conan (Jason Momoa) seeks revenge on the cruel warlord who destroyed his village and killed his father.I like the brutality and the blood splattering violence. But this suffers two major problems. The first is the length of this movie. At almost 2 hours, it is way too long. There is no reason for a 2 hour Conan movie. It feels stretched out, and too slow in many parts of the movie. Too much of the story is a meandering mess.The second is the comparison between Jason Mamoa and Arnold Schwarzenegger. Jason is no Schwarzenegger. He has half the charm and half the presence. I still like Jason Mamoa, but he's no Arnold.I do appreciate the attempt. They try their best with a big scale production. The stunts are good. The battles gets pretty big. Stephen Lang is a good bad guy. And Rose McGowan is great as the creepy weird Marique. If only they scale back the running time to a more manageable length. This could have been just good enough to recommend.",Conan the Barbarian
3,Prismark10,Hollow and shallow,3,12 August 2015,"The Conan the Barbarian remake is a sometimes flashy, competent but dull reboot of the Arnold Schwarzenegger movies which truth be told was not too special in the first place.It starts off with narration by Morgan Freeman with some cod The Lord of the Rings style mythology, that Conan being born of war in the battlefield and soaked in blood as a child.When he was a kid, Conan's father is killed by a vicious warlord Khalar Zym (Stephen Lang) who with his Gothic witch daughter Marique (Rose McGowan) is trying to find lost pieces of a mythical mask that enables him to become a god. With the complete mask in his possession to fulfil his prophecy he must have the pure blood descendant of an ancient sorceress to unleash the power of the mask.Jason Momoa has few words in this would be sword and sorcery epic that heavily steals from other films. It is rather clichéd stuff. Conan comes across as a bland guy and not much of a barbarian. The script is uninspired, the direction is anaemic, it looks nice on screen but everyone and everything is two dimensional without any vim and vigour.",Conan the Barbarian
4,claudio_carvalho,Entertaining Adventure,7,14 July 2013,"Many years ago, sorcerers crafted the Mask of Acheron and dark forces of Acheron conquered the world. However, the barbarians vanquished Acheron warriors and broke the Mask into pieces and divided among the tribes.The barbarian Cimmerian village of chief Corin (Ron Perlman) is attacked by the evil warlord Khalar Zym (Stephen Lang) that wants the last piece of bone of the Mask of Acheron to resurrect his wife. When his witch daughter Marique (Rose McGowan) finds the hidden piece, he slaughters the villagers and the Corin's son Conan is the only survivor. Conan swears revenge against Khalar Zym.Years later, the warrior Conan (Jason Momoa) is a pirate and he decides to release slaves from a field. When he is celebrating in a tavern with his friends, he sees a thief being chased by a guard and Conan recognizes him as Lucius (Steven O'Donnell), the Khalar Zym's soldier that he cut the nose out. Conan let the guards capture him and once in the prison, he forces Lucius to tell him where Khalar Zym is. Meanwhile Khalar Zym attacks a monastery where Marique believes that a pure-blood descent of Acheron lives. But the monk sent the descent Tamara (Rachel Nichols) back to her homeland. She is chased by Khalar Zym's soldiers, but Conan saves her. Now Conan intends to use Tamara to reach the evil Khalar Zym. Will he succeed in his intent?""Conan the Barbarian"" is an entertaining adventure, full of action, fantasy and special effects. I was reluctant to see this movie, since I do not like remakes, but this 2011 movie is totally different from the 1982 Conan the Barbarian with Arnold Schwarzenegger. The good story of revenge has a great cast, and Rachel Nichols is one of the most beautiful contemporary actresses. I had low expectations with ""Conan the Barbarian"" and I had a favorable surprise, maybe because I am fan of this genre. My vote is seven.Title (Brazil): ""Conan, o Bárbaro"" (""Conan, the Barbarian"")",Conan the Barbarian
5,nogodnomasters,DO YOU REALLY WANT TO BUY THIS?,5,22 April 2018,"I love Conan/ Middle Earth type of movies, although for some reason the original Conan lacked appeal to me, perhaps because it looked like Arnold wore a wig the whole time. In this film we get a significant childhood view of Conan as a person who has more heart than brains. After his village is destroyed and his father killed, Conan wanders the earth to find the man and seek revenge.He comes to a town involved in slave trade, kills the traders and frees the topless women in a cage. Later soldiers show up and Conan deliberately gets himself arrested so he can get inside of the prison camp to get information. Of course armed guards are no match for a chained Conan.Conan is a barbarian, a Viking type. Another tribe appears to mimic Native Americans with Mohawks and another of the 12 tribes mimics Mongolian. The problem with Conan, the Barbarian is that he speaks as a barbarian with bad lines and a bad delivery. The CG specials effects make this a better film. There is a good supporting cast, however Conan himself was just written poorly. For most people this should just be a rental.No f-bombs, nudity, one poorly lit sex scene.",Conan the Barbarian
6,kosmasp,Mindless,5,5 March 2012,"There is many reasons why you shouldn't like this movie. It's dialogue, the acting and the story as it is. But while all those things appear very mindless and barbaric, this might also be something might somehow appeal to you. I thought it was so senseless that it kinda was fun to watch in a strange way.Of course Momoa will not delete Schwarzenegger from our memory and the latter will be remembered as the ultimate Conan yet. But while I have no idea how the Comic Conan is, I can tell you that you are better off, finding something to cling on in this, then just wince your way through it. Plus you have to give them kudos for going R-rated from the get-go (could you imagine a PG-13 Conan? Exactly!). So while not really good, it kinda can be fun",Conan the Barbarian
7,jboothmillard,Conan the Barbarian,3,16 April 2017,"The original 1982 version, with Arnold Schwarzenegger (before becoming a superstar in The Terminator), is a cult classic, although I personally don't think it's very good, or its sequel Conan the Destroyer, so I didn't think a remake would be any better, directed by Marcus Nispel (The Texas Chainsaw Massacre (2003), Friday the 13th (2009)). Basically warlord Khalar Zym (Don't Breathe's Stephen Lang) wishes to reunite the pieces of the Mask of Acheron, crafted by a group of sorcerers and used to subjugate the world, to revive his dead wife and conquer Hyboria, the pieces were scattered among the barbarian tribes. Young Conan (Leo Howard) is the son of Corin (Ron Perlman), chief of a barbarian tribe, he is skilled, but his father believes he is not ready to wield his own sword, the entire village are murdered by the forces of Zym, after Corin's piece of the mask is located, Conan and Corin are chained and trapped under a vat of molten metal, but Corin sacrifices himself to allow Conan to escape, Conan is the only survivor of the attack and vows revenge. Years later, the warrior Conan (Game of Thrones' Jason Momoa) is a pirate, he finds a slavery colony, the slaves are freed when his tribe kill the handlers. While celebrating in a tavern in the city of Messantia, Conan recognises Lucius (Steven O'Donnell), one of Zym's soldiers from years before, he cut off his nose when he was younger, Conan forces Lucius to tell him where Khalar Zym is. Meanwhile Khalar Zym attacks a monastery the sorceress Marique (Scream's Rose McGowan) believes that a pure-blood descent of Acheron lives, but elderly monk Fassir (Raad Rawi) warned Tamara (Rachel Nichols), of a bloodline of Acheronian necromancers, to run away and return to her homeland. Tamara is chased by Khalar Zym's soldiers, but Conan saves her, he realises that using Tamar may be the only way to reach the evil Khalar Zym, but also to save the great nations of Hyboria from an encroaching reign of supernatural evil. Also starring Saïd Taghmaoui as Ela-Shan, Bob Sapp as Ukafa and Milton Welsh as Remo, with narration from Morgan Freeman. Momoa is no substitute for Schwarzenneger, Lang and McGowan are fairly good villains, and Perlman does steal the show in the short time he is on for, this version may have more advanced special effects that look fantastic, and slightly more gore and aggressive fights, but it doesn't have any humour or charm, it is definitely more style over substance, a very average and barely memorable sword-and-sorcery fantasy adventure. Adequate!",Conan the Barbarian
8,ma-cortes,Violent adventure epic about the brutal warrior set in Hyborian Age and facing off nasty enemies,6,2 December 2014,"This new though inferior ¨Conan¨ by Marcus Nispel was well starred by Jason Momoa, Rose McGowan , Rachel Nichols and Ron Perlman . This recent adaptation is an exciting picture with plenty of action, thrills, chills, roller-coaster ride , violence and breathtaking fights. Overwhelming sword-and-witchery epic in one of the first and main roles for Jason Momoa , ulteriorly to Baywatch and Game of thrones . Sword-and-sorcery epic with incredible adventures , spectacular battles and strong scenes . This is an epic adventure set in Hyborian Age based on Robert E. Howard's pulp tales with screenplay by Thomas Dean Donnelly , Joshua Oppenheimer and Sean Hood , based on the characters created by Robert E Howard . It stars Jason Momoa in the title role, as the Hyborian Age hero fighting against ominous and heinous nasties . A vengeful barbarian warrior called Conan (Kellan Lutz and Jared Padalecki were considered for the lead, but the role went to Jason Momoa and Chris Hemsworth was also considered for the character) sets off to get his revenge on the evil warlord who attacked his village and murdered his father when he was a boy . As Conan seeks vengeance when being kid he saw as his daddy (Dolph Lundgren, then Mickey Rourke were in talks to play Corin, Conan's father, but Rourke turned it down to do Immortals (2011) before Ron Perlman was cast) was burnt by a cruel warrior (Stephen Lang), and his daughter (Rose McGowan) subsequently his village was slaughtered and he enslaved . Many years later , Conan undertakes a perilous travel with the help his sidekicks Artus (Nonso Anozie) and Ela-Shan (Said Taghmaoui) , all of them are assigned to free a young virginal priestess (Rachel Nichols who had a body double for her sex scene) from the claws a brutal enemy and his satanic witch . They undergo on a risked trip to find the priestess , contending the cult leader and his giant hoodlums and leading a vibrant ending.This violent sword-and-witchery story packs noisy action , blood-thirsty battles at every turn , full-blooded adventure, thrills , crude scenes and rip-roaring fights . The picture is unbelievably brutal and sexist though also displays some love scenes and raunchy images . The scenes about the ship traveling throughout landscapes bear remarkable resemblance to ¨The man on a wilderness¨ by Richard C Sarafian , this ship ""Hornet"" is a fairly accurate replica of a 17-18th Century Chinese junk, especially with its three square sails . The savage warriors with horned helmets deliver the goods , their appearance is spectacular and creepy, including the majestic horses doing pirouettes. The evil barbarians are characterized in similar style to the classic 'Conan' by John Milius, as when at the beginning appeared James Earl Jones in some unforgettable scenes . Jason Momoa hired after playing his savage role in ¨Game of thrones¨ , enrolled in an intense six-week training program at a stunt and martial arts academy in Los Angeles for his part, while still finalizing negotiations for the film . Made on a grand scale , with spectacular production design , adding computer generator backgrounds and colorful cinematography by Thomas Kloss , mostly filmed in Bulgaria and Malta . The sombre photography with a sort of never-ending dawn and dusk time is truly awesome . It's a kind of light mingled in a moody and foggy atmosphere. Big budget and lavishly produced by the great producers Avi Lerner , Danny Lerner , Les Weldon ,Trevor Short and Boaz Davidson from Milennium . Impressive and groundbreaking musical score composed and conducted by Tyler Bates , in Basil Poledouris style . Conan fans will be delighted with this breathtaking and bloody epic . Acceptable and gripping realization by Marcus Nispel but with no originality ; Brett Ratner was originally attached to direct before being replaced by Marcus Nispel . He's a video hits director and expert on terror genre such as he proved ¨Friday the 13th¨, ¨Frankestein¨ , ¨Texas chainsaw massacre¨ but none of his movies have been based on original plot.The original Conan , of course , was much better, it was directed by John Milius and starred by Arnold Schwarzenegger , Max Von Sidow , Gerry Lopez , Jorge Sanz , Sandahl Bergman , Nadiuska and James Earl Jones . Followed by a sequel titled ¨Conan the destroyer¨ with Wilt Chamberlain , Grace Jones , Sarah Douglas and Olivia D'Abo that contains some dumb images and is unintentionally hilarious but amusing ; furthermore several low-grade imitations and rip offs, and spawned TV series starred by Ralph Moller. Plus a similar film realized in old-fashioned and lightweight style also directed by Richard Fleischer titled ¨Red Sonja¨ with Brigette Nielsen as female lead , Sandahl Bergman and of course Arnold Schwarzenegger has a brief guest spot.",Conan the Barbarian
9,BA_Harrison,Arnold's Conan looks like he could use Momoa's barbarian to pick his teeth clean.,4,6 March 2015,"Created by the sorcerers of Acheron during the Hyborean Age, the Mask of Acheron has the power to summon evil forces. During a battle between the sorcerers and the Cimmerians, the mask is shattered into shards and divided between the barbarian tribes (instead of being crushed into fine powder and scattered to the four winds, as would be the sensible thing to do).Years later, evil warlord Khalar Zym (Stephen Lang) attacks the tribes, collecting all of the shards and killing young Conan's father (Ron Perlman) in the process. Twenty years pass, and Khalar Zym is still searching for a pure-blood descendant of the sorcerers of Acheron to unlock the mask's power (give Khalar Zym his due, he's determined: most people would have given up by now). Meanwhile, Conan, all grown up (and played by Jason Momoa), goes in search of Zym looking for revenge.At 6' 5"", Jason Momoa is actually several inches taller than Arnold Schwarzenegger, who played Conan in the 1982 movie directed by John Milius—but you wouldn't know it by looking at him in this new adaptation of Robert E. Howard's sword and sorcery novels: he might be a big fellow, but Momoa lacks Arnold's amazing steroid-enhanced bodybuilding physique, making his Conan much less impressive by comparison.But the titular character's leaner look ain't the only problem with this reboot/re-imagination/remake/regurgitation of Robert E. Howard's legendary sword swinger: star Momoa lacks Arnold's charisma as well as his muscles, the plot is a turgid mess of fantasy clichés, the film relies heavily on mindless CGI set-pieces, Stephen Lang's villain isn't a patch on James Earl Jones's Thulsa Doom, and Marcus Nispel's handling of the action is utterly banal, the director having not improved one iota in this department since his utterly painful Pathfinder (2007).On a slightly more positive note, the production design is impressive, some scenes looking like they're straight out of a Frank Frazetta painting, the brutality is unflinching, with every sword hit resulting in a splash of bright red gore, and Rachel Nichols, as pure-blood Tamara, is very easy on the eye.",Conan the Barbarian
10,paul_haakonsen,Finally a remake that is worth watching...,8,6 November 2011,"Initially I had some reservations about watching this movie, because of the legendary older Conan movies with Arnold Schwarzenegger. That and the fact that remakes usually end up being insulting to the original versions. But it lack of better to do, I sat down and watched this 2011 ""Conan the Barbarian"" movie.One word can actually summarize the entire experience: wow! Now, true enough as other reviewers have staked out, the movie is not heavy on storyline. Actually the story is a tad shallow and lacking that extra spice to make it unique. But what the movie lacks in story, it more than makes up for in action, battle scenes and lavish scenery. The movie was really a treat for the eye. Not ""Sucker Punch"" eye-candy, but still a very nice visual treat.I especially liked the scenery throughout the movie and the sets. There were so many nice details to the scenery and stages, and it really helped to flesh out the world and make it come alive and make it believable. However, it did seem like the movie makers were on a hype to try to put as many different sceneries and settings into the movie, because it jumped around a lot. Sure, you got to see a lot of different (and marvelous) places, but it was a bit too much, because it sort of made the story seem too jumpy.And speaking of details, then the armors, costumes and weaponry were so nicely detailed as well. That really helped the movie have that fantasy-world look, and it was great to see.Jason Momoa (playing Conan) really did a great job, and he sure had some big shoes to fill out, taking on Schwarzenegger's old character. Both actually did it great in each their own way. Momoa, however, was easier to relate to, as there was no heavy Austrian accent overshadowing the dialogue. Leo Howard (playing young Conan) was also quite good, and he really did a tremendous job at fleshing out Conan as a boy. Thumbs up for that one. Now, I am not a big fan of Rose McGowan (playing Marique), but she really knocked the nail right on the head with her wicked role in ""Conan the Barbarian"".""Conan the Barbarian"" is a testosterone-filled action adventure, that skips lightly over the storyline. So don't except a major thinker of this movie, it is just lean back in the seat and enjoy the action.Comparing this movie to the ""Spartacus: Blood and Sand"" TV series, then they have equal production value. But ""Conan the Barbarian"" is not impeded by excessive use of foul language and language that isn't even appropriate to the set era in which it is supposed to be set. ""Spartacus"" had potential, but the language made it come tumbling down fast and hard. You won't see that in ""Conan the Barbarian"" - just a friendly heads up.I am glad that I did give this movie a chance, because it totally blew me away. It is definitely a worthy addition to the movie collection, especially if you are a fan of the fantasy genre. And it is definitely one of the better fantasy genre productions to come out of 2011.",Conan the Barbarian
11,BandSAboutMovies,A giant ehhhhhh,3,30 January 2019,"Before Aquaman, Jason Momoa was almost another franchise star with this 2011 reimagining of Conan. Directed by Marcus Naspiel (who was also behind the remakes of The Texas Chainsaw Massacre and Friday the 13th) and narrated by Morgan Freeman, it failed at the box office and had mostly negative reviews. That's never stopped us from loving a movie before, so let's check it out.Conan is the son of Corin (Ron Perlman!), who is the chief of the Cimmerians and also a tough dad who doesn't think his son is ready to hold a sword, despite him beheading several enemies. There's also this Mask of Acheron that needs put back together, something that big bad Khaler Zym needs to bring his wife back to life. His troops attack Corin's people, killing everyone but Conan.Fast forward to Conan's days as a pirate, where he meets Ela-Shan , a thief and together they embark on a journey to destroy Zym. Conan disfigured Lucius, one of the guards, as a child and goes further now. They learn that Zym seeks Tamara, a descendant of the sorcerers of Acheron, whose death will unleash the mask.Bob Sapp, who was a major pro wrestling, MMA and pop culture star in Japan plays Ukafa, the leader of Zym's soldiers.Zym and his daughter, Marique (an unrecognizable Rose McGowan who spent six hours a day in makeup for the role) attack a monastery, but Tamara runs away and is saved by Conan. For the rest of the film, Conan fights off many attempts on her life before saving her and recovering the sword that was taken from his father.This was also made before Momoa became a big star on Game of Thrones. Dolph Lundgren, Mickey Rourke and Arnold Schwarzenegger were all asked to play Conan's father, yet refused.This film felt like a video game cut scene for nearly two hours to me. It's glossy and filled with CGI, with a huge budget compared to any Conan film that ever came before. Yet it just didn't have the feel that I was looking for. Perhaps you'll feel differently.",Conan the Barbarian
12,LeonLouisRicci,Opening Act is the Best...Then Closes Poorly,4,11 August 2013,"Is this Movie as bad as you've heard? Probably. But that depends. If you are an Adolescent Male that pulled Himself away from the XBox to watch this you might differ. After all, there is a goodly amount of bloodshed, in fact a lot of bloodshed. There are some bare Female Breasts, some, but probably not enough for the Fanboys.Anyway, it is troublesome when the Star of the Film is out Acted by his Juvenile counterpart in the opening Flashback. In fact, it is the first Act of the Movie that is the best. It is the most Dramatic and the most intriguing. But when Conan grows up things are definitely not more Mature. They are just more digitally enhanced.Things really do fall apart from that part on. There are numerous, meant to be exciting and pseudo-realistic, battle scenes with lots of lost limbs and loss of blood painting the Screen. But this type of thing has become so saturated in our Culture that it barely stimulates any adrenaline.The ending is so busy and the Screen is so filled with chaos that it is nothing more than confusing, irritating, and incomprehensible. That could also describe some of the Performances and miscasting, the most obvious is the Teenage Witch, looking like a reject from the Casting Call of ""Charmed"" playing dress up. The ""Actor"" playing Conan is not far behind. Butt, there is a quick shot of His bare Behind.",Conan the Barbarian
13,CinemaSerf,Leave well alone - please!,4,9 December 2020,"Sorry but this is awful... Why in the name of all that is holy do producers never look at an original film and think: this ain't broke, leave it alone...? Jason Momoa has neither the charm nor the charisma to carry of the part in this shoddily written/directed and acted rehash of Arnie's earlier performance from 1982. It has little, if any, sense of peril or menace and whereas the first film builds and gathers momentum after the tragic beginning in which the village is ransacked and ""Conan"" taken captive; this one relies entirely on, admittedly decent, CGI and leaves us with a character-free fantasy action movie that is a dry as a bone.",Conan the Barbarian
14,utgard14,Behold... and despair,3,16 January 2014,"Whether this is a remake or not is debatable. Obviously the original film is paramount in most people's minds when they think of the character Conan. But the character comes from Robert E. Howard's popular pulp stories, as well as the later Marvel comic books. Since this film does not directly redo the original's plot I will say that it's less a remake than another adaptation of the source material. That being said, it has little in it taken from Howard's stories.The cast is terrible. Jason Momoa smirks his way through the film and lacks any charm or screen presence. He can't seem to stop contorting his face into as many different grimaces as possible to let you know how tough his Conan is. At no time did I feel he was as imposing a figure as Arnold Schwarzenegger was in the original film. I wanted to slam the actor playing young Conan in the early part of the movie because of his terrible ""look at me I'm so tough"" face. But since Momoa continues that expression, I will assume both were directed to do so and cut them a modicum of slack.Rachel Nichols is weak and seems like she's in a different movie set in a different era. Rose McGowan hams it up but there's no fun in it. Ron Perlman collects a paycheck. This is an actor who seems to have exceeded his Bruce Campbell ""I have a cult following so I can appear in as much crap as I want and my fans will eat it up"" quota. Ten years ago it was a popular thing to praise Perlman because he was fairly unappreciated in the mainstream. For me, at least, it no longer matters when I see his name attached to a movie. He's been in far too much crap. The extremely overrated Stephen Lang continues to prove he's no better than the average actor on network television. How this guy has developed the following he has is beyond me. He's not a terrible actor, just not a great one either.Director Marcus Nispel is one of the worst directors working in mainstream Hollywood in the last ten years. I would place him just behind Uwe Boll and John Moore. Nispel comes from a music video background and, like most directors who started that way, he seems to have no appreciation for filmmaking beyond computer effects and trying to make his heroes look pretty and his villains look outlandish. Nispel creates a very banal movie. There's nothing in it that is memorable or effective. Sadly, for a director so obsessed with the visual, the movie looks wholly unoriginal and unimpressive. The 1982 film had a distinct look and was a trendsetter for the sword & sorcery boom of the '80s. Visually, this movie has more in common with The Scorpion King than Conan the Barbarian (1982). Ultimately this is a piece of crap. Don't waste your time with it.",Conan the Barbarian
15,zardoz-13,"An Above-Average Remake of ""Conan the Barbarian""",8,23 August 2011,"The savage sword & sorcery saga ""Conan the Barbarian"" ranks as an above-average but bloodthirsty adventure fantasy with impressive CGI effects and despicable villains. Hawaiian hunk Jason Momoa of ""Baywatch"" takes over the role that Arnold Schwarzenegger immortalized in 1982's ""Conan the Barbarian"" and then reprised for the lackluster 1984 ""Conan the Destroyer."" Repeated efforts to produce another ""Conan"" epic afterward suffered one setback after another until director Marcus Nispel arrived on the scene. Clearly, Lionsgate Studio hopes the barbarian franchise will yield as many sequels as its ""Saw"" franchise. Indeed, Nispel qualifies as a specialist in revitalizing moribund franchises. He helmed the respective reboots of both slasher movie franchises ""The Texas Chainsaw Massacre"" and ""Friday the 13th."" Nispel and ""Dylan Dog: Dead of Night"" scenarists Thomas Dean Donnelly and Joshua Oppenheimer, along with ""Cube²: Hypercube"" scribe Sean Hood have rewritten the action so it barely resembles director John Milius' classic. Momoa plays Conan as a cynical but straightforward soldier-of-fortune. He is pugnacious to the hilt. The chief difference between the two ""Conan"" heroes lies in their behavior before the death of their fathers. As an adolescent in the Schwarzenegger film, young Conan behaved like an innocent little lad without a malicious bone in his body. Conversely, the youthful Conan in the reboot is portrayed as hellion who wields a sword with murderous aplomb, slaying all cruel opponents and taking their heads without a qualm. Nothing about the Momoa ""Conan"" is coy compared with Schwarzenegger's ""Conan."" Moreover, the new Conan is neither taken into captivity for long nor crucified like the Schwarzenegger hero who died and came back to life through sorcery. Nispel and his writers shun humor as they plunge their brawny Cimmerian champion into a number of cliffhanger adventures. ""Hellboy's"" Ron Perlman makes a memorable impression as Conan's dad Corin. Meanwhile, ""Avatar's"" Stephen Lang as the loathsome Khalar Zym and ""Planet Terror's"" Rose McGowan as his kinky daughter Marique challenge Conan at every turn and emerge as two villains that you will love to hate.""Conan"" opens on the battlefield with a bang. Conan's pregnant mom is caught up in the thick of combat when she suffers a mortal blow. Crying out for her husband Corin (Ron Perlman), she insists she must see her son before she dies. Corin performs a Caesarian section on her and shows her baby Conan moments before she dies. Corin trains his son from the cradle to be a warrior. He forges a special sword for him. Little Conan (Leo Howard of ""G.I. Joe: The Rise of Cobra"") does his chores around the house, but he yearns to fight with the big guys. One day, little Conan gets his chance during an initiation ritual that requires him to carry a bird's egg in his mouth while negotiating an obstacle course in the wilderness. Conan and his competitors encounter an advance force of marauders. The others spit out their eggs and flee in fear. Little Conan confronts the invaders and slaughters them without cracking his egg. Corin is impressed with his son's pugnacity but he doesn't get to live long because the evil Khalar Zym and his army descend upon their village like bloodthirsty locusts. Zym has been on a scavenger hunt to recover the fragments of a magical mask. Once he acquires all of the pieces, Zym will become a god and he will be able to revive his wife who was burned at the stake for her sorcery. At Zym's side lurks his equally malevolent daughter Marique. She sports a spiked Freddie Kruger glove and can read the minds of her victims. After she finds a piece of the mask hidden in Conan's village, Marique and her father kill Corin, wipe out everybody but little Conan, and resume their march.Eventually, after Conan grows up, he stumbles onto one of Zym's lieutenants. The man is easy for Conan to recognize because Conan sliced off his nose with a saber during a short-lived fight. Zym admired little Conan's ferocity so much that he refused to let his lieutenant kill the lad. Twenty years has passed and the impatient Zym, his daughter, and their mutant army are still on the prowl for a descendant of a pure-blood race, a female monk named Tamara (Rachel Nichols of ""Star Trek""), who they must sacrifice in a complicated ritual which will restore Zym's wife to life. Conan and his cohorts beat Zym to the prize and Tamara falls in love with Conan. Nevertheless, Zym and his daughter manage to abduct her and Conan pursues them with a bloodlust.""Conan"" teems with allusions to other fantasies. The most imaginative occurs when Marique conjures up warriors from sand. They dissolve into granules whenever Conan's sword slashes through them. Nevertheless, these gritty adversaries go after Conan with a vengeance. These sand warriors are reminiscent of ""Jason and the Argonauts"" (1963) where warriors sprang from teeth planted in the earth. Incredibly enough, Nispel relies on supernatural elements only during the second half when our hero encounters an octopus-like monster beneath Zym's kingdom. Conan spends 112 minutes on his eternal quest to wreck vengeance on the wicked dastards that killed his father and devastated his village. Comparatively, the 1982 ""Conan"" lumbered along for a leisurely two hours plus and featured a naïve hero who became more sophisticated after he embarked on his journey of hardship to find his father's killers. The Nispel ""Conan"" remake depicts our hero as an amoral warrior. Momoa informs the beautiful heroine that he craves three things: to live, to love, and to slay. As Conan, Momoa is far more sadomasochistic than Schwarzenegger. Hardcore old school ""Conan"" fans may not appreciate the liberties that Nispel and company have taken with author Robert E. Howard's creation. Of course, Momoa doesn't overshadow the legendary Schwarzenegger, but the ""Baywatch"" star brings his own brand of charisma to the role. Squeamish audiences may not be able to handle the surfeit of blood, gore and more in this ""Conan"" remake.",Conan the Barbarian

The much better original version starring Arnold Schwarzenegger always focused on the character's lifestyle generating from where he came from. It didn't include scene where Conan as a teenager carried an egg in his mouth and ran some stupid obstacle course to see whether he was fit to be a barbarian. As in the original film, Conan witnesses the destruction of his village and the death of his father. Then Nispel propels him into the future where he has companions of no background. In fact, it seems all Nispel is interested in is having battle scenes every two minutes. Jason Momoa is no Schwarzenegger and his portrayal of Conan is pale by comparison. Stephen Lang plays the villain who slain his village and seeks to resurrect his sorcerer of a wife using some sort of mask. He will eventually get his ass kicked. Rachel Nichols is an embarrassment as a true blood for which Lang seeks in order to complete his task. Her dumbest moment arrives when she follows Conan ashore after a massive battle and engages in sex. Then she leaves early in the morning only to get lost and eventually captured. Rose McGowan plays Lang's feisty witch daughter who can taste true blood. Ron Perlman makes a wasted appearance as Conan's father who dies in battle.

You don't feel for any of the characters. The excessive graphic violence from beginning to end just overwhelms this movie. I know they were aiming to make something darker and less family oriented than Scorpion King etc but they went overboard here. There are just too many slashings and dismemberings. Don't bother with this one - it's terrible from start to finish. The original with Arnold was better.",Conan the Barbarian
20,Wuchakk,"Looks great, nice action, but needed more depth",6,2 September 2011,"Although the set-up of ""Conan the Barbarian"" (2011) is the same as the 1982 version (raiders destroy Conan's village in Cimmeria and thus the barbarian seeks revenge) the story is otherwise completely different. The villains here are Khalar Zym and his witchy daughter, Marique, who seek to resurrect Zym's sorcerous wife, but they need to acquire the pure blood necessary for their Acheron magic.WHAT WORKS:Jason Momoa, as Conan, is excellent; far better than Arnie. It's hard to conceive of a better Conan. The Bulgarian locations are outstanding. The Costuming is more convincing than the '82 version. Conan's apparel, for instance, is more faithful to REH than Arnie's fur loincloth. Better acting than the '82 version, excluding James Earl Jones, of course.Brutal, thrilling action throughout with convincing swordplay (unlike the contrived '82 version). Corsairs, highlighted by Conan's comrade Artus, effectively played by likable Nonso Anozie. Excellent sets/props; it definitely looks like the Hyborian Age. Good serious vibe, despite the cartoony, over-the-top last act. Rose McGowan as the witchy daughter is ee-vil and creepy. Ron Perlman as Conan's father. The whole opening sequence. I liked how the film stressed the closeness and love of Conan and his father. There's a correlation between true greatness and a close relationship with a strong father-figure and his example of excellence. You have to give credit to the filmmakers for effectively illustrating Conan's youthful days and life in a Cimmerian village in general, something Conan's creator never delved into in any detail.WHAT DOESN'T WORK:The film deviates from Robert E. Howard, albeit not as much as the '82 version. Regardless, it certainly adhered to REH's overall pulp vibe. I'd prefer to see one of REH's originals put to film, like ""A Witch Shall Be Born"" or ""Beyond the Black River."" Stephan Lang as Zym makes a worthy enough villain for Conan, but he comes off too clichéd and cartoony, especially in the final act. James Earl Jones' Thulsa Doom worked better, likely because he was so unique. Rachel Nichols' Tamara is solid as the female protagonist, but she doesn't hold a candle to Sandahl Bergman's Valeria. The score is serviceable but pales in comparison with Basil Poledouris' score from the '82 version and ""Conan The Destroyer"" (1984). This score definitely won't be celebrated 30 years later like Basil's. Why didn't they just update Polerdouris' piece? There's too much ""Modern Blockbuster Syndrome"" that appeals to those with ADHD. Especially the over-the-top final act, which is way too comic booky. It's cartoony overkill, pure and simple. But, then again, it did bring to mind REH's ""Jewels of Gwahlur,"" so maybe it's not so far off the mark. The biggest flaw was that there wasn't enough depth. The film needed more 'downtime' to contrast the wall-to-wall action, like campfire scenes (which would better indicate distances), more camaraderie on the ship, more development of Conan & Tamara's relationship, etc. Although it had some of this, it wasn't enough. Action sequences naturally hold more weight when the audience cares about the characters. As it is, it's clear that the filmmakers wanted to make an action flick above all else and this weakens the film. Along with lack of depth was the lack of epic-ness or moving moments. The '82 film deviated from REH but at least it made up for it with depth and a sense of epic-ness. For instance, when Conan & Subotai make their stand against the riders of doom or Conan's moving victory salute, not to mention the potent love & death/funeral scenes, etc. This 2011 version had glimpses of this, like when Conan is birthed on the battlefield then raised to the sky and when Conan's father expresses his love with his final act, but, again, it needed more.CONCLUSION: The filmmakers got a lot of things right, like Momoa as Conan and the authentic look/feel of the Hyborian Age. The film's not bad at all and pulsates with energy, but it needed more depth, epic-ness and uniqueness to pull it out of its ""blockbuster"" mediocrity. It's a case of violence for the sake of violence, which gets dull by the 90-minute mark, plus the last act is just comic booky overload. The focus on wall-to-wall action limits the film's effectiveness. It lacks the confidence to chill and allow the characters to breathe. Still, it's a somewhat worthy Conan movie. It's serious and brutal; and, thankfully, lacks ""cute"" characters. It's arguably on par with ""Conan the Destroyer"" and superior in ways, not to mention leagues better than ""Red Sonja"" (1985) and ""Kull the Conqueror.""The film runs 1 hour, 53 minutes.GRADE: B-/C+",Conan the Barbarian
21,zetes,Lousy,4,11 December 2011,"A giant turd. Maybe it's that this genre of movies has just become too generic at this point, I don't know. They seem to do everything wrong here. First and foremost, the guy who plays Conan, Jason Momoa, is just a cheap pair of man tits. He's so freaking dull and has absolutely zero charisma. No surprise that he got his start as a lifeguard on Baywatch. The screen writing is pretty awful, too, of course. They make Momoa so much nicer than Arnold's Conan. Basically, Conan here is a dashing hero. While not a direct remake of the 1982 film, this one does contain the element of Conan trying to avenge his father (well played by Ron Perlman in the far-too-long prologue) and his people, but Momoa is so polite about it. You'd never catch him coldcocking a camel. Stephen Lang, one of Hollywood's go-to villains after the awful Avatar, is terrible as the villain, too. About the only person having any fun here, besides Perlman (who gets to wear an awesome beard), is Rose McGowan, who plays Lang's witchy daughter who is always wearing these cool, metal finger daggers. The film does look decent, with nice costumes and set decorations. I like the score, as much as it pales in comparison with Basil Poledouris' from the original.

23,Hellmant,Conan the Boring!,5,2 September 2011,"'CONAN THE BARBARIAN': Two and a Half Stars (Out of Five)A new movie adaptation of the classic sword and sorcery Cimmerian tales, created by Robert E. Howard in 1932. This version is directed by Marcus Nispel (the man who also directed the horror remakes of 'THE Texas CHAINSAW MASSACRE' and 'FRIDAY THE 13TH') and written by Thomas Dean Donnelly, Joshua Oppenheimer and Sean Hood. It sort of serves as a reboot to the popular 80's adaptations starring Arnold Schwarzenegger. I'm a big fan of the original 1982 cult classic and usually don't have a problem with remakes but I'm kind of upset about this one. The film is so disappointing and it hurts the franchise because it could mean we won't see another 'CONAN' film in a while and I was really looking forward to seeing a good one!This version stars Jason Momoa (a TV actor most well known for appearing on series like 'BAYWATCH' and 'STARGATE: ATLANTIS') in the title barbarian role and this is the film's first major problem. Momoa is no Arnold Schwarzenegger and compared to him he makes Arnold look like an Oscar worthy actor. Many would say Schwarzenegger's acting wasn't actually that impressive in the original 'CONAN' film but his great screen presence was undeniable and he really made that film something special that it couldn't have been with any other actor. Momoa is a horrible actor and has absolutely no screen presence. He's no action star and casting a pretty boy rather than a tough guy as Conan was a grave mistake by the filmmakers. I have been impressed with Nispel's other work (with the exception of 2007's 'PATHFINDER' which was decent at best but it did have a real tough guy in the lead at least, Karl Urban, who would have made a much better Conan even). Nispel's directing here is so uninspired that the movie feels like nothing more than an extended episode of some 'B' syndicated TV series, the type that would probably star Kevin Sorbo. The music score by Tyler Bates is so weak and unemotional compared to Basil Poledouris's masterful 1982 score that it really brings the film down as well. These are the three most blatant and obvious problems with this Conan, in my opinion, but the film gets almost nothing right. Miscalculations this massive are depressing. The story revolves around an all powerful mask created by evil sorcerers during the Hyborean Age. They made the mask from the skulls of former kings and sacrificed their 'pure blood' daughters in order to give the mask the power to take over the world. The sorcerers were defeated by barbarians and the mask was shattered into several pieces and hidden around the world to keep it safe from ever being formed again. One piece is protected by the barbarian known as Corin (Ron Perlman), father of Conan. When a warlord known as Khalar Zym (Stephen Lang) comes to their village and kills everyone in it in order to find the mask piece Conan is left behind as the only survivor. Conan of course grows up bent on revenge. He also must assume the task of stopping Zym and his daughter Marique (Rose McGowan), a powerful witch, from assembling the mask and sacrificing the 'pure blood' descendant of the evil sorcerers named Tamara (Rachel Nichols), whom Conan also of course develops feelings for (despite his sexist ways). The movie is above all boring, which is one of the highest criticisms you can pay a film in my opinion. Despite it's flashy effects, 3D visuals and $90 million budget (compared to the original's $20 million, which even adjusted for inflation would be less than half the new one) the film is just a big bore. The characters are not the least bit involving and while the visuals look cool the action drags (I found my mind drifting quite a bit, even when a big action spectacle was happening before me). The poor acting, directing and music all play a part in why the movie is so dull obviously (maybe the screenplay wouldn't be so bad in the hands of better filmmakers, here it just doesn't work). Even the original's less impressive 1984 sequel 'CONAN THE DESTROYER' was far more entertaining than this. The movie does have cool visuals to look at though (including beautiful women) and it is mildly amusing (mostly in fascination of how badly they f___ed up the material but...). For that it probably deserves at least an average rating (there are a lot worse movies out there). It's just extremely disappointing.Watch our review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_lBzdmfUfA",Conan the Barbarian
24,Robert_duder,"Popcorn popping, blood pumping, rocking good time!!",9,11 January 2012,"In all my 1100 IMDb reviews I am beginning to understand the difference between critics and movie lovers. I am not a critic apparently. I can go into a film with an open mind and varying expectations and I can enjoy a flick for exactly what it is. Is Conan a feat of cinematical brilliance? Obviously not. Is the acting award worthy? No. And if you went expecting either one then you're brain dead. Even if you went into expecting the campy cult feel of the original then you're not thinking clearly. I went in not knowing what to expect and what I was met with was a rip roaring, blood soaked, brilliant action flick. It isn't campy at all and I think the acting, especially from the lead cast, was significantly better than the original but there should be no comparisons anyways.Jason Momoa tears onto the screen and ass kicking, sword wielding barbarian Conan and I think this should literally launch his career because he does a great job. Cult favorite character actor Ron Perlman also does a great job as Conan's father who trains him and raises him as a warrior. My only complaint is that Perlman wasn't used even more in the film. Stephan Lang deserves kudos for his role as the evil and twisted Zym who has terrific chemistry against both Perlman and Momoa. The supporting cast all do a good job and the story carries well on the backs of the main cast.Director Marcus Nispel comes from music videos which can be a red flag for action flicks because I find that directors whose experience is in music make action movies that can sometimes be choppy and incoherent but that is the complete opposite of Conan that is beautifully shot, brilliant paced, gory, dark, gritty, just a wicked action movie. So the moral of the story is ignore people that are looking at a movie like this searching for something they will never find. Go into this movie understanding what it is and you'll find yourself terrifically entertained and rooting for some more action! 9/10",Conan the Barbarian

Yes, it had to happen - even a Schwarzenegger film can be remade. Although Arnie's Conan outing is looking a bit dated these days and can hardly be described as his finest hour, do we really need an updated version? Hollywood says yes.
So, 'Not Arnie' is now Jason Momoa - a skirt-wearing barbarian in 'Not Middle Earth' whose father dies at the hand of some of the world's ugliest baddies who wear menacing black armour (and a witch who is the coolest of the lot). A fair bit of the film is dedicated to Conan as a child and his interaction/training from his father (Ron Perlman). Okay, so obviously most of it is with Momoa, but I'm mentioning the bit when he was a child because there was so little of this 'backstory' in Arnie's version. Anyway, the nasties who destroy his village when he was a boy happen to spare his life and roll off into the sunset while dragging a massive galleon around with them through whatever part of the so-so 3D computer-generated 'Not Middle Earth.'

30,The-Sarkologist,Bring back the old Arnie Conan,4,25 December 2011,"This movie was disappointing to say the least, though I doubt it could ever have really exceeded the original movie. The major difference is that the original Conan movie was mostly narrative with some dialogue thrown in, where is that movie has a little narrative and a lot more dialogue. I am not if the original movie was supposed to be like that, however the original movie being mostly narrative while following the action on the screen gave it a uniqueness that I have not seen in many other, if any, movies.The plot of the two movies are quite similar in a number of aspects. Conan as a child grew up in a village that had the secret of making steel, and an invading force attacks the village and kills everybody, except Conan, who then goes out to seek vengeance against the person that destroyed his village. This, however, is where the similarities end. In the original movie, it is because the invader, the head of a snake cult, wants the secret of steel, and when the village is destroyed, Conan is taken away as a slave.The back story is a little different here. Centuries ago there was a mighty empire of necromancers, but the empire collapsed and the realm of Hyboria collapsed into a collection of warring tribes and nations. The artifact that held the ancient empire together, a mask, was shattered and scattered across the world so that the ancient powers may not be awakened. However Khalar Zim and his daughter the witch, are seeking a way to resurrect Zim's wife so that they may resurrect the ancient empire, with Zim as the emperor.The original movie had Conan travelling the lands after escaping from slavery, and in doing so he brings together a group of companions to help him. One includes a thief and another a sorcerer (played by Mako). In this movie, he does have some companions, however they generally do not travel with him throughout the entire movie, but rather come and go when needed, and most of the time Conan is on his own. Personally I really did not like this, particularly since in the original movies Conan was the leader of his companions.A brief look at some of the other reviews of this film suggests that many people seem to agree with me. The original films were cool, almost bordering on classic (if one can consider it a classic, though my definition of a classic film is a film that I fondly remember from my childhood, which many, if not all, films are unable to do these days, namely because it is not my childhood). In short, this movie was okay, but nothing hugely wonderful, and one that can be returned to the video store to stay there.",Conan the Barbarian

Lang was underused, McGowan was not weird enough (never thought I'd say that) and Perlman was mediocre at best. The majority of the near one hundred million dollar budget went on sub-par visual effects with noticeable green screen, gimmicky 3D effects and Freeman's salary for narrating the story. Its by-the-numbers plot made for no excitement, Nispel's direction was absent of any emotional focus and the editing regularly succumbed to half second jump cuts. It was just a mess. Films like this need to invite you into a world filled with dark magic where you feel the blistering heat during a mighty sword battle. Not put you to sleep! I'm just going to keep this review short and sweet, because I have nothing else to mention in this empty action ""epic"". Stick to the original, as this remake contains zero charm and zero intensity.",Conan the Barbarian
34,Tweetienator,Mediocre Is Not Good Enough for Conan,4,25 August 2021,"Jason Momoa is no bad Conan but he is not Conan, Arnold Schwarzenegger is the one and only ;) Nispel's version has in my view a few issues that weakens the whole movie - some plot changes to the origin of Conan (like in the book of Mr. Howard) are unnecessary and weak - a child Conan kills a bunch of Pict warriors: this is just stupid and compared to the original material (Conan developing his strength in hard slavery work and his skills to fight and kill in the arena as a slave gladiator). If you compare the movie from 1982 (directed by John Milius) to Nispel's movie you easy can see what story is the stronger one. Also Schwarzenegger got a ton more charisma as the Cimmerian warrior than Momoa, who is not bad but not too good either. All in all the 2011 movie is not that bad, but rather unnecessary and unsatisfing for those who are familiar with the original material. One question left: there are tons of Conan stories written by Robert E. Howard and his sucsessors, why not producing one of the other adventures instead of trying to ""reboot"" the story of Conan with a weaker rewritten version of an already done and very good movie?",Conan the Barbarian
35,digitalbeachbum,I dislike dopey scripts,1,19 August 2011,"I can't say enough bad things about this movie that would make it worth my time and effort.This movie lacks so much that I will never admit that I watched the movie. After seven years in production they should have written it off and sacked the entire production.The special effects sucked or weren't needed. The script is lousy. The directing is lacking ability. The acting is OK, but ends up being blah in the end.I'll never own the DVD even if it is a gift. I'd resell it or return it for cash to buy a better movie.",Conan the Barbarian
36,Vartiainen,Pointless remake,5,23 December 2013,"My first reaction upon hearing that they were going to make a new Conan the Barbarian film was to ask: ""Why?"" The original, starring Arnold ""Adorable Accent"" Schwarzenegger, is a cult classic for a very good reason. No improvement needed. Still, the trailer did look intriguing, the special effects upgrade is usually a good thing and quite honestly I liked Jason Momoa as Khal Drogo in Game of Thrones. So I decided to give this one a chance.Well, it's not terrible. Had I had no expectations or had I not seen the original, I think that I would have liked this one okay. It's a decent enough adventure/fantasy film. The plot is pretty much rubbish, none of the characters get enough characterization for them to be interesting and as a whole it's not very memorable, but I could have enjoyed it for the action and the visuals. But it's a remake, which unfortunately means that comparing it to the original is inevitable.And really, this film's biggest problem is its name. Had they called it The Mask of Acheron or something other than Conan the Barbarian, people would have liked it well enough. Jason Momoa is charismatic enough in a rough sort of way to carry this kind of film, but Schwarzenegger he is not, which pulls the impressions down.So, is it worth seeing? Well, if you're a huge fan of fantasy genre or you really want to see the world of Conan in film, you might find this a great experience. For casual fans of fantasy and action this is probably a bit of a bore. I don't regret seeing it, but I could have lived without it as well.",Conan the Barbarian
37,DarkVulcan29,Makes you miss Arnold in the role.,3,24 August 2011,"I liked the 1982 film, and kind of like the sequel, both starred Arnold Schwarzenegger. Now nearly thirty years later, comes a new installment to the franchise, and newcomer Jason Momoa is in the title role and how does he fair up. He is quite uninteresting, he is stale compared to Arnold, Arnold at least had charisma, in which Momoa seems to lack. And Momoa does not look like Conan, he looks like a GQ model dressing up has Conan for Halloween. Stephen Lang has the main bad guy is just an annoying cliché, and Rose McGowan has the daughter of the bad guy, and a evil Sorrecer, does not bring much to the film.Now Rachel Nichols is the only one in this film that makes this watchable, I like the way she is tough as nails, and never backs down from a fight, and I wish the film was more about her. Some fight scenes are alright, but nothing that will make you jump with excitement. But other than that, this film is a totally fail.",Conan the Barbarian

39,dfranzen70,To hear the lamentations of the viewer...,4,21 May 2012,"It ain't much, but what's there... well, still ain't much. Even as sword-and-sandal type movies go, this remake of the Schwarzeneggar cult fave has many of the requisite ingredients for a cheeseball movie, but there's a lack of charm and, yes, cheese. You might be better off skipping the tepid do-over entirely.Conan (Jason Momoa) is war-born, meaning his mother died right on the battlefield while giving birth to him. His dad is the barbarian's chieftain, Corin (Ron Perlman), who - no spoiler, really - is quickly dispatched of by an evildoer who's intent on resurrecting his dead sorceress wife by means of a magical mask and the blood of a virgin. (When watching this movie, if you dare, you may wonder why the various tribes didn't just destroy the mask instead of cutting into identical shards to be buried individually. Me too.) Conan may have the smarts of The Hulk, but he does have some sort of honor code. Hard to imagine that a barbarian would have a moral code, but there you go. When people save his life, he helps them, rather than just slaying them. Maybe he's just smarter than the average barbarian. At any rate, a virgin named Tamara (Rachel Nichols) gets on his good side, and luckily they both have Khalar Zym (Stephen Lang) as an enemy. Zym, a master swordsman himself, has the assistance of his weird-looking daughter Marique (Rose McGowan), who's following in her mom's evil footsteps by being a despicable, magic-wielding wench with a barbed tongue. This makes her infinitely more interesting than either Conan or Tamara.There is much blood shed. There are plenty of battles. Don't look for nuance. It's not meant to make an appearance, although every now and then Conan appears to have a hidden layer. But not really. He has a single minded quest, although he doesn't mind helping others along the way. Aren't barbarians supposed to be, you know, barbaric?Unlike the Arnold version, there's no great speech about hearing the lamentations of the women of one's enemies, who are then driven before you. This Conan, speaking as briefly as possible, probably doesn't know what a lamentation is. He's quick with a sword, not with his wit.The movie isn't terribly good, even if it's your thing. It's dark for many action scenes, thus making it difficult to see who's getting beat up by Conan. Even when it's light out, there's not a lot of imagination in the battle, except when Marique's involved. But when she's not around, which is often, it's really just a simple sword fight by a muscleman and some one else.And poor Morgan Freeman - how did he get roped into narrating this? Did he owe a debt? He lends the movie a lot more gravitas than it deserves, although it's definitely needed. With any luck, he completed his work in a day or so.The rest of the cast is uneven. Lang is his usual constipated self; typecasting, perhaps. Ron Perlman is great in his few scenes as Conan's dad. Nichols is eye candy. Said Taghmaoui provides good comic relief for a spell, and Nonso Anozie is a big, charismatic actor who probably could have been Conan. Odd fact: in this movie, the title character's name is pronounced just like Conan O'Brien's - that is, like ""Ko-nin""; in the original, it was pronounced ""Ko-nan."" Why this is, I don't know. Did the filmmakers think people would relate better to the former pronunciation? Give me Conan the Librarian instead.",Conan the Barbarian
40,JoeB131,Not a bad film...,6,22 November 2011,"It was actually pretty enjoyable.The plot is simple enough. Conan is a barbarian minding his own business until an evil sorcerer slaughters everyone in his village. He then spends the rest of his life seeking revenge. The basic plot is not too different than the 1982 version, and slightly better acted. So it definitely has the right flavor.The only actor you might really recognize here is Ron Perleman, usually the kiss of death for a movie, but he works here as Conan's father.The movie doesn't shy away from sex and nudity, which I give it points for. The MPAA has taken all the fun out of movies.The action scenes are okay. Predictable, but kind of no real surprises.I still think the 1982 film was a better film, despite Schwarzenegger's limitations. I don't think this guy is going to be a major star in ten years.",Conan the Barbarian
41,XweAponX,"Should not have been a ""Conan"" movie",7,18 April 2012,"There was one and only one writer/director who could tackle Conan, and that was John Milius.He understood the character of Conan, just like he understood Teddy Roosevelt in The Wind and The Lion. He is personally a lot like Conan himself. Bacause he knows the Riddle of Steel: Steel is not strong, Flesh is stronger.That phrase is a concept underlying all Robert E Howard's works regarding Conan. And only one director ever got it right. John Milius.This film, it's not bad in itself, but it's not a Conan movie. But I am increasing my rating tp 7/10 because whatever this is, it's done well. The imagery is good. The locations, well chosen. My only complaint really is that Jason Momoa does not look like the same guy without his beard. Momoa is a kind of Barbarian looking guy, he did well in Game of Thrones. He did well as Aquaman, and I wait for that solo DCCU film to come out.Perhaps if Conan the Barbarian had not already been made and made well previously, this could have been accepted. But any attempt to remake Conan fails, because of what we have seen in John Milius work. Even the Richard Fliescher sequel, it changed the nature of Conan so he was a drunken jokster, so that was not Conan either. Which was too bad because the Grace Jones character could have been great.May 5th 2018Previous Review:Why are most movies of the 2010's so Unremarkable?15 April 2012Probably because most of the movies of the 2010's are ""remakes"" and ""reboots"". Not all of them, but a lot of them.As I've stated, I don't hand out less-than-10 reviews of a movie unless it was particularly bad - This movie falls in that category. Yet for some reason, my previous attempts at reviewing this film are magically vanishing- Which is highly unusual, I've said nothing in here any less offensive than in several other reviews I've read here that basically say ""it just sucked"" - Which maybe I agree with, but I want to explain WHY it sucked. But I'm not really saying it ""sucked"", just that it was not a Conan movie. Mostly, people are seeing the same thing I see: That this film flows like an episode of the old Sam Raimi Xena/Hercules shows. But why me saying this is unacceptable, is way beyond me. I don't like using up my valuable 1000 word limit speculating on why my review was deleted.This is a remake, or rather a reboot of the original 1981 Conan the Barbarian with Arny Schwarzennegger, which directed by John Milius was one of the classic movies of an era, pre Computer, which used fantastic effects created practically.What drove that original movie was STORY. I don't know how much of Robert E Howard they got into that first one, but they were able to get the SPIRIT of Conan.This movie, is Conan in name, but ""Hercules the Legendary Journeys"" in actuality (Which I actually liked much more). In Fact, 1997's ""Kull the Conqueror"" with Kevin Hercules Sorbo was supposed to be in this same universe, apparently was Conan's Dad. Maybe they moved to Cimmeria later, had lil Conan, and then were invaded by Thulsa Doom and Big Ben Davidson. But even that film, Kull, despite it's own problems, still told the same kind of story as the original Conan film.This entire movie runs like a long ep of that Hercules show, without the comedy of Michael Hurst to give us relief. Even the 2nd Conan film ""Destroyer"" had that side-kick who was pretty funny, especially in those interactions with Grace Jones.But there are flashes of Imagery, which is why I do not mark this an Instant ""1""-- Nothing can equal that first Conan movie with Arny - There was a magic in that film. There was a mystical beginnings back story and a worthy enemy, the one played by Darth Vader's Voice. There was an arch crook played by The Oakland Raider's Big Ben Davidson beneath the master crook. There was MAGIC! There was greatness - It is forever a classic in the annals of great fantasy movies. This movie had some interesting imagery, but it did not tell that amazing backstory of how Conan became Conan. ""Crush your enemies, listen to the lamentation of their women and children"". That was the person Conan was trained to be, a warlord. This film tries to add a Halo to Conan that was never there in the books or the original film.Now, this new take on Late Night with Conan O'Barbarian - It's not a BAD movie, it just AIN'T CONAN. It's Ronon! There are some cool monsters, and there is an evil wench played by Rosie McGowan. She's got a cool haircut at least. But this was when she was making Testosterone-movies and not complaining about it. And Stephen Lang is far from the level of evil wizard from the first movie. Actually I had forgotten he was in this, didn't recognize him, so I can give him credit for that.And all of this pillaging just to resurrect a squiggly mask? Serious lack of story. However - There is one thing this movie has got. Rachel Nichols, who played a Green-Skinned, Red Haired Orion Slave Girl that Kirk is with in Uhura's Starfleet Quarters in Star Trek XI. She was pretty good. And Hellboy (Ron Pearlman) was there, too. So just rip the Conan name-tag off this. And grow a beard, Ronon Dex!",Conan the Barbarian
42,MBunge,Only watch it if you haven't seen the original,5,19 May 2013,"One of the worst things about modern, or postmodern, culture is the division between art and entertainment. Put simply, art is not expected to be entertaining and entertainment is not expected to be artistic. That's how we wind up with so many carefully crafted art house flicks that bore the pants off the general public and big budget blockbusters whose storytelling ranges from sub-mediocre to downright atrocious. There may be no better illustration of that than to compare this Conan movie to its Schwarzengger-starring predecessor. That film aspired to genuine artistic merit, which led it to become perhaps the greatest sword-n-sorcery epic of all time. This one aims no higher than basic competence and though it meets that mark, such a lack of ambition ultimately leaves the viewer unsatisfied.A cinematic reboot of Robert E. Howard's greatest creation, this motion picture echoes the first in that it's all about Conan's quest to slay those who massacred his village when he was a child. In this one, Khalar Zyn (Stephen Lange) kills everyone in order to claim the final piece of a magical mask that he needs to revive his slain wife and, somehow, resurrect an ancient empire of evil. Conan survives the attack and grows up to be Jason Momoa, who crosses paths with Zym again 20 years later and must prevent him from ritually sacrificing a woman (Rachel Nichols) and completing the final part of his obviously long-delayed plan.There are only a few things wrong with this movie. Both the beginning and end are way, way, waaaaaay too long. I mean, you're a half hour in before grown up Conan appears and the final battle against Zym is a meandering mess that goes at least 10 minutes longer than it should. There's also far too much time spent on Zym. He's essentially an equal to Conan as a main character on screen. It's one thing to do that when you're dealing with the Joker as played by Jack Nicholson or Heath Ledger. Generic bad guy portrayed by veteran character actors should not be elevated to that status.The rest is no worse and maybe a bit better than most sword-n-sorcery flicks, though Rose McGowan's hammy performance is a bit of an acquired taste. The problem is that these filmmakers had not intention or desire to try and make a great movie. They just wanted to come up with something good enough to score at the box office. The plot is okay. The music is okay. The cinematography is okay. The costumes are okay. The set design is okay. The action scenes are okay. There are no chances taken. There's no striving for the exceptional. It's nothing more than yet another genre film.Such thinking didn't exist with the original. Though the subject matter may have been adolescent or melodramatic, the filmmaking and storytelling was still expected to try and be as good as anything else on screen. The writing needed to be sharp, subtle and memorable. The visuals had to stand up, in technique and style, to what the audience might see in more high class fair. And the music...goodness! The soundtrack of the original Conan the Barbarian is one of the greatest in Hollywood history.I can give this film a bit of a break because it's traversing well-worn ground that was still somewhat fresh and new when Schwarzenegger donned loin cloth and blade. That doesn't obscure the truth that the best thing about it is how well the comparison of the two serves as a primer on the superiority of the filmmaking of previous generations.",Conan the Barbarian
43,juneebuggy,"Disappointing remake, although Mamoa was still nice to look at",5,16 October 2014,"Well I didn't hate this but it wasn't great either. I actually enjoyed the beginning scenes with Conan as a boy with his father (Ron Perlman) but then as soon as young Conan becomes Jason Mamoa it got super cheesy.The action scenes in general were pretty meh, and I had a problem with the gratuitous spraying blood. I mean come on, men were getting stabbed through leather body armour yet blood was literally geysering in spouts, it was ridiculous.Sadly this holds nothing on the original, in fact it would have done better as 'Son of Conan' or something remotely connected to the same world, because as much as I thought Mamoa was a good choice for a remake he just can't live up to Schwarzenegger. Although Mamoa was still nice to look at Biggest disappointment; no enslaved pushing the giant wooden wheel of pain and growing muscles scene. 12.13 Best line from the movie... ""I live. I love.

44,NateWatchesCoolMovies,Nispel has a knack for the visceral,6,13 September 2016,"I've never seen any of the original Conan films with Ahnuld (I know, get the torches and pitchforks), so I don't really have anything to compare Marcus Nispel's remake to, but on it's own I found it to be a solid, serviceable sword and sandal outing with a welcome hard R rating and some neat work from legendary actors. Jason Momoa was fresh of his Game Of Thrones stint, jumping right into a very similar role as iconic Conan, a musclebound soldier of fortune on a grisly quest to exact revenge against warlord who decimated his village when he was but a pup. Momoa exudes a different aura than I imagine Schwarzenegger must have, a stoic, silent tunnel vision style as opposed to posing theatrically. It works, but it's a new Conan from the one I've seen in many a trailer and snippet on TV, that's for sure. My favourite part of the film is the extended prologue, which just somehow feels like the most grounded part, whereas everything else is almost cartoonish, reminding me of stuff like The Mummy. The opening is terrific though, introducing us to a young Conan (Leo Howard) and his father Corin (Ron Perlman, who else?), living in their nomadic village on the edge of nowhere. Enter tyrannical villain Khalar Zym (Stephen Lang) and his super freaky daughter Marique (Ivana Staneva), played later down the line by Rose McGowan, before she got all lame on us. Laying waste to Conan's home and killing countless people including Corin, he is left to breed fearsome vengeance for years, until he sets out into the wide world on a journey to find Zym and mess him up real good. The story is standard, the action is well staged by Nispel, who has a golden eye for spectacularly orchestrated displays of violence in his films, and pulls no punches here. He also casts roles on the nose, and has for years. Lang is in overdrive, practically frothing at the mouth and turning Zym into something scary indeed. McGowan is straight out of a Takahashi Miike film, all bone white hissing snarls and needle sharp appendages, a hellcat with supreme bloodlust that you just don't want to encounter. Momoa has the brawn for Conan, but a few extra syllables of dialogue wouldn't have hurt, if only to round the guy out some more and give Jason something to say, which he rarely gets to do in his work it seems. I think parts of the film, especially the finale, were somewhat ruined for me by the catastrophically bad 3D they used (when oh when will they learn with the damned 3D), so I feel like a Blu Ray revisit is nigh, in which I can fully appreciate some of the set pieces without being reminded of a popup book. It's a good time at the movies, but like I said, I have nothing to compare it to as far as Conan goes.",Conan the Barbarian
45,slokes,Brood. Slay. Yell. Repeat.,3,13 February 2014,"If people typically talked in fantasy stories the way they do in this 2011 revamp of ""Conan,"" no one would ever read them.In the opening narration, Morgan Freeman tells of ""cruel necromancers"" (as opposed to your nicer type of body snatcher) and ""spirits of unspeakable evil"" (which makes one wonder how the words trip so melodiously from Freeman's tongue.)Then there are the lines delivered by other characters, like ""She is the pureblood we seek"" and ""She saved my life. For that she has my loyalty.""The film's main villain, Khalar Zym, has a penchant for Big Statements, like ""Your death shall herald a new age of Acheron...and we will cast all rivals into oceans of blood!""Nobody talks normally in ""Conan The Barbarian."" It's all very stilted, high-reaching declamations of ersatz Shakespeare that become more of a drag the more it goes on. Alas, this matches up pretty well with a patchy, convoluted story.Conan (Jason Momoa) is a barbarian prowling his ancient world on a quest for vengeance. Khalar Zym sacked his village and killed his father in quest of a mask to summon the spirit of Zym's dead wife. Can Conan stop Zym before he finds the final thing he needs, the blood of a woman (Rachel Nichols) residing in a peaceful monastery?Two things prevent me from titling this ""Faux-Nan"". One is Momoa, who has both the brawn and the authority to play the title role, better than Arnold Schwarzenegger did back in 1982. Momoa has a sense of humor, too, which the script allows him to show only briefly near the beginning. The other positive is the fight scenes, which, except for a silly battle on a tilt-a-wheel near the end, are visceral and pack a punch.In his director's commentary, Marcus Nispel talks about designing the movie to work like a video game, with Conan completing various levels by doing battle with one or another of Zym's henchmen. This is all-too- apparent in the final product, as the narrative rushes Conan from one fight to another with no logic. The only purpose to these scenes is to give us a big finish, where Conan and his crew yell and wave their swords at the sky in slow motion.Nispel steps on the gas right away and keeps his foot planted there the whole movie. The intensity is exhausting. Also predictable. When Conan is born, will his father (Ron Perlman) lift him to the sky? You bet. How about hollering like a maniac while doing it? Why not?That Nispel and the writers don't use Conan's creator Robert E. Howard for any story points, other than the first sentence of the movie, is surprising. Oddly, they do work in some of the goofier, less sensible elements of Arnold's version, like the opening village invasion and Conan infiltrating a black-magic ceremony at the end in a borrowed robe. You feel throughout this movie a director grasping for big visuals, at the expense of telling a story.""Conan"" tells a story, alright. When you take a product people know and attempt to revive it on screen, you better have a clearer idea what you are doing than these people did.",Conan the Barbarian
46,dworldeater,"Worst than I could have possibility imagined , I'm in awe of how bad this is!",1,13 April 2013,"Everything negative you have heard and read about this movie is true. As a matter of fact it is worst than I could have possibility imagined. This reboot has more in common with The Pirates Of The Caribbean than the John Milius film or the REH source material . Even though there is blood and a juiced up Hawaiian dude running around with a sword yelling at people with his shirt off, said dude has zero charisma and poor screen presence . In Game Of Thrones Momoa was good because his part was small and he wasn't allowed to talk. Momoa couldn't carry the film , but the film itself has a story that sucks , poor direction , lame action sequences , bad f/x and horrible acting from the rest of the cast( Ron Pearlman was okay in his cameo). For a production that cost 70 million , the audience deserves more. I have seen movies on the Sci Fi channel that have more class and better production value than this.

47,Enchorde,Testosterone filled action,6,1 September 2011,"The name Conan comes with a lot of expectations. Many of them created by the movies in the 80s starring Arnold Schwarzenegger as an absurdly muscular barbarian warrior. Compared to the young Schwarzenegger Jason Momoa who has inherited the role is slim, but perhaps is a better actor. But in essence they are both the same. Huge men, with big muscles that wields a big sword.When I think about there isn't much more to it really. That might seem a little meager, but really, who expects anything else from a movie named Conan the Barbarian? We have the muscled hero, a lot, lot, lot of fighting and action and sometimes just a little too much blood and gore. The plot is somewhat of a reboot of the old movie, instead of a continuation. It is a little thin, good enough to base an action movie on, but it does lack a dimension if there is any visions beyond just action movie. What could have helped is better supporting characters with real depth. For instance is the character Ela-Shan very under used and undeveloped. Even rather big characters as Tamara, Marique and Ukafa could really have been much more developed. As it is now it is just about Conan really, and his fight against Khalar Zym. It is just a bit too thin, too simple.Jason Momoa bears the role surprisingly well. Not as muscled as Schwarzenegger, but a little better actor. And Stephen Lang is good as the bad guy, even though he seems a little undeveloped as well.But in the end, Conan is an entertaining movie, and that's what really counts. Never a dull moment just right along my expectations.6/10",Conan the Barbarian
48,eric262003,Not Much Heart Was Put Into This Reboot,5,24 January 2021,"In the original 1982 adaptation of ""Conan the Barbarian"" directed by John Milius and starring Arnold Schwarzenegger based off the stories from Robert E. Howard featured a provocative sword and sorcery fantasy adventure that launched the acting career of Schwarzenegger. It had a ruthless villain in Thulsa Doom performed by James Earl Jones and it had a great love interest for Conan performed by Sandahl Bergman. This newer version of ""Conan the Barbarian"" was a far cry from its predecessor due to its lack of storytelling and instead decides to go out of its way by entertaining us with blood, carnage, half-naked women and nothing else more. It felt more like a ""300"" movie than a ""Conan"" movie. It gives me the impression that the filmmakers were not interested in drawing a stimulating narrative and instead felt more interested delivering violent gore as if to say we're too dumb or too restless to follow a developing story and just unleash the bloody splatters for our entertainment.The sad part was that the opening scenes show a lot of promise. I'm just disappointed that the rest of the movie did not follow up after that. After an engaging battle that involves Conan's father Corin (Ron Perlman), we see him perform a Cesarean strangely while he's in the midst of battle. As his wife is dying, she tells her husband to name her son ""Conan"". The next few scenes feature a young Conan (Leo Howard) train in combat and seemed like a natural at it, though he lacks the discipline and the expectations from his father who dishes the toughest love towards Conan. Conan successfully decimates an entire squadron of creatures without breaking much of a sweat. Unfortunately, Corin is killed at the hands of a diabolical warlord named Khalar Zym (Stephen Lang) who's intentions were to search for the missing pieces of The Mask of Acheron, in order to bring his dead wife back to life and to take over the land of Hyborea. With the assistance from his wicked sorceress daughter Marique (Rose McGowan), Khalar needs the blood of a virgin lady who is willing to sacrifice herself while he put the pieces of the mask together. By now, Conan (Jason Momoa) has grown up to become a cunning warrior and eventually finds that rare virgin woman named Tamara (Rachel Nichols) and engage in intercourse. Does that make her ineligible?When it came to set pieces, the original 1982 version was almost to perfection. You had intriguing props like The Wheel of Pain, the Tree of Woe and the palace where Thulsa Doom resides which fit the time period of the movie flawlessly. The 2011 remake lacks the appeal of its locations mainly due to the poor editing as Conan's journey from one locale to another tends to be too frequent and underdeveloped. The awkward camerawork and the choppy scene changes tend to meander all over the place. And while the fight scenes in Conan's youth were engaging at best, but the warriors that looked like they were chiseled from rock seemed easily breakable feels like minute flashes that run the course of this movie.Physically, Momoa was perfect for the role of Conan like they way that was intended to taken from the novel by pulp writer Robert E. Howard. Though his character is a man of a few words, he does deliver a line that perfectly defines himself his intentions of being a fierce barbarian: ""I live, I love, I slay, and I am content"". Still Schwarzenegger is ten times the better Conan than Momoa. Arnold used humour to add depth to the character and his incredible physique and brutal strength made him easily an untouchable warrior that would have any adversary trembling in their sandals. As for villain, Lang as Khaler Zym was a formidable opponent for Conan, I just had this moment of unsettlement with his semi-incestuous relationship he had with his vile daughter Marique.The real low point of this ""Conan the Barbarian"" reboot was that there wasn't very much in terms of excitement. Sure there are tons of brutal moments, but it doesn't surmount to anything other than to segue onto the next even more brutal bloody fight. The movie lacks in heart, soul or effort to inject decent storytelling that is desperately needed for a movie like this. It was like a mindless video game and even video games have better storytelling than this.",Conan the Barbarian

HBO does it better: sure it's passable, but who wants passable?",4,20 August 2011,"Conan lacks myth - it truly lacks that sense of myth and wonder that created a whole new genre, and it lacks cinematic vision, it lacks what makes film rather than TV, and while entertaining after a decade of Xena and Game of Thrones we deserve more than this in our big budget movies.Casting is fine, plot is a little dull, action is half-way to OK - it's just that overall there is nothing to really put life into this - where is the wow! factor, the, yes this is film. Even if you're making a B movie it doesn't excuse it.In the right hands and the right team this could be storytelling at its best, instead we get a film that thrives on the cliché of its genre. It may have lots of sorcery, but it truly lacks magic.",Conan the Barbarian
50,MR_Heraclius,By Crom this was a bad remake.,6,23 February 2020,"A lazy script and under developed villains really hurt this Arnold remake.

Failed attempt but see it for Momoa's performance.",Conan the Barbarian
51,Screen_Blitz,This sword-and-sorcery adventure transpires to one bloody sword battle after another with very little to offer in its narrative scope,4,5 August 2017,"Following the Arnold Schwartznegger rendition in the early 1980s, Conan the Barbarian has struck again on the silver screen, but not for an entertaining time. This updated rendition of the barbarian warrior succeeds boasted plenty of potential from its grittier update of the eponymous character. Unfortunately, this film lavishes its potential on a hopelessly unengaging story and direction that never quite lands. Directed by Marcus Nispel, the man behind two critically clobbered horror remakes 'Texas Chainsaw Massacre' and 'Friday the 13th', this sword-and-sorcery tale delivers a feast of viciously graphic violence and gore splatters that makes Zack Snyder's '300' look more tame, tightly embracing its hard R-rating. But one thing that Nispel proves is that you simply cannot score a compelling action piece just throw in one gruesome action scene after another after another without dedicating some time to construct the plot and characters. It is just grows numbing and unappealing after a while long before it reaches the end credits. Citing this movie as an abhorrent disaster may be saying a lot, but it is nowhere as fun, exciting, or even intriguing as it sets out to be. Set during the fictional Hyborian age, the film stars Jason Momoa as Conan, a barbarian warrior who sets out on a perilous journey to seek revenge against a ruthless warlord Khalar Zym (played by Stephen Lang) along with his tyrant army wiped out his village and ultimately murdered by father Corin (played by Ron Perlman). Joining him on his quest is free slave Tamara (played by Rachel Nichols) who helps him on his vendetta while fighting against a horde of hideous monsters and Zym's evil minions. Whether you are watch this in 3-D or in regular version, this historical epic more often than not feels like a chore to sit through. Although there is plenty of intense, graphic battle sequences to keeping moving, the film never rises above the level of a slipshod fantasy extravaganza with nothing to offer but an excess of visually compelling scenery to feast the eyes. The first twenty minutes are fairly proficient, introducing the setting as well as the titular character as he witnesses a horrific tragedy of his village and his father. The scenery of the ancient world, resembling the middle- earth universe of the 'Lord of The Rings', in which the action takes place is at least nice look at. But when it comes down to kicking the action in gear, that is when the film crumbles. Director Marcus Nispel appears to have almost no interest in plot and instead allots a vast majority of proceeding splicing a long series of choppily edited battle sequences, and they all stitched together with constant brief moments of talking that rarely amounts of any sort of development to the plot or characters. Now is there any ounce of excitement delivered throughout the proceeding? Yes, but it comes far and few in between to the point where you question your willingness to sustain to the end. And for the bigger question, was Jason Momoa the right choice for substituting Arnold Schwartznegger in the role? While Momoa's performance is not inept, the portrayal of his character is tarnish by his weak and at times, laughable dialogue. The same problem lies with Stephen Lang's portrayal of Khalar Zym. And Ron Perlman, good grief! What a waste of a wildly compelling actor. Conan the Barbarian is a unfertile sword-and-sorcery fantasy actioner plagued by an overabundance of graphically violent battle sequences without any solid effort of pushing for a coherent narrative. Those who come for to snack on some intense swordplay and graphic carnage will by mildly satisfied, while those seeking for a compelling story will be drenched in disappointment. Hollywood could use a sweet rendition of the barbarian warrior, but this is not it.",Conan the Barbarian
52,oneguyrambling,"Not great. But the best kind of big, dumb, bare-chested action.",6,20 April 2012,"Unlike many other thirty-somethings I wasn't that enamoured by the Conan franchise in the 80s. I mean I saw them all and only a few years later was converted to a full Arnie-Fan with Predator, Commando and The Terminator, but his leather loin-cloth and gleaming weapon never did that much for me.So saying I looked at the reboot with some trepidation is a bit of an understatement. Well here is the almost apologetic square up: Now that I have seen Conan 2011 I wish I caught it in its (extremely limited) cinema run.Forget Centurion and The Eagle (though The Eagle is perhaps a better film), THIS is what big screen dumb bare-chested action is all about. Put another way; anyone who enjoyed the Arnie originals – or anyone who spends too much time staring at heavy metal album covers – will find much to enjoy here.Conan was born in the same place he lived – on a battlefield – in a hasty poor man's caesarean amid a huge ongoing bloodbath. As he aged and matured Conan was similarly premature in his battle readiness, beheading his first four savage assailants and proudly displaying them to his proud chieftain Father (Ron Perlman) before his barbarian-balls dropped.Then on the same day Conan's life changed. Jay Leno announced he wanted his old gig back and wait, wrong Conan.On his fateful day Conan's Father died, and the final piece of an ancient mask with supernatural powers was gathered by a vicious murderer named Khalar Zym (Stephen Land), a man with a rapidly growing army of heavily armed followers and aspirations of global domination. With the mask in hand all Khalar Zym needed to fulfil his prophecy was the blood of a 'pure woman', and he, his army and his young witch daughter Marique (Rose McGowan) set off to search for it.But Khalar Zym didn't tie up one very important loose end. He left young Coney alive to swear vengeance with his final words before his mighty voice broke What follows is everything you expect from a film with Barbarian in the title. And more. Conan 2011 is violent, blood-soaked and action packed on a suitably large scale, with tough mono-syllabic talk, furrowed brows and heaving bosoms of all kinds.Along the journey Conan must face a myriad of faceless minions, fanciful monsters and magical creations, all seemingly desperate to leap athletically upon his huge sword. Speaking of huge swords, Conan must also escort the damsel with the afore-mentioned pure blood, a young woman named Tamara (Rachel Nichols), with who Conan shares a 300 style sex scene that sets him apart as the most giving barbarian lover on record.Jason Momoa does his best as he can as Conan in a role that practically demands that he be wooden and dumb, Stephen Lang is suitably villainous as Khalar Zym and benefits from being surrounded by a menacing menagerie of minions (Hey I love alliteration), and Rose McGowan chews the scenery as the evil witch who is quite possibly 'Daddy's little girl' in a most inappropriate sense.Final Rating – 6 / 10. I watch too many movies. I now look for reasons not to revisit films and subsequent sequels. I cannot extol Conan as one of the films of 2011 – far from it – but if they decide to make a sequel to this reboot I will watch it, this time at the cinema.",Conan the Barbarian
53,Sergiodave,"Not good, but hey.",4,10 October 2020,"I admit that this is not great and Jason Momoa is not a great actor, but really, anybody reading some of these reviews would think the original was on a par with 'Citizen Kane'. Everyone talks about the charm and the qualities of the Arnie version, but it was 'd' grade rubbish that I as a 12 year old thought was great before realising that Arnie as an actor was far worse than Jason Momoa and James Earl Jones was just getting a paycheck.

Wow, was I ever wrong. This gag-a-tron breaks all molds and expeditiously lowers the bar to a new depth. Not all of this thing is completely miserable. I actually understood those poorly written lines eloquently mumbled by Jason Mamoa, another good part is....ahhhhh....never mind forget it...that's it. The directing, camera work and rest of cast is all forgettable. CGI is CGI is CGI but can't hide poor casting, a lousy script and a pricy film being a complete waste of time. Some people may see it differently and may have loved this - that's fine. With all my spewed negativity this thing may be considered by some as 'that breakthrough artsy-fartsy flick those film aficionados have been just waiting to sink their teeth into' or not.

55,adamscastlevania2,Lousy remake to an Arnie classic,3,7 October 2014,"(23%) At times I had to remind myself I was watching a remake of big Arnie's Conan and not a harder edged sequel to ""The scorpion king"" minus the Rock and with all the fun taken out. The script could not be any thinner, more so than even the original and with added crappier dialogue piled on top. The real fly in the soup though is the fight sequences, they are mostly so poorly filmed and edited that all sense of what the hell is going on is lost and it just gets boring to watch. The constant two and one second cuts whenever something that should be exiting is happening, particularly towards the end, just looks really uninspired and poor. It has to be said that the film is moderately entertaining with its Morgan Freeman narration that he clearly did one lunchtime between takes whilst making probably a better movie and the sand people part is decent, but really don't pay any money to see this, its not worth it.",Conan the Barbarian
56,tomimt,Conan the Boring,4,26 September 2014,"The most remarkable thing about Conan The Barbarian is how boring movie it manages to be. It's full of action and adventure, yet it all is delivered in a fashion that really doesn't manage to grasp you in. This is mostly the fault of relatively poor script but as well as aimless direction of Nispel, who most of the time errs to think style is substance and thus nothing in the movie really manages stand out properly.The old Conan The Barbarian, directed by Milius and starring Schwarzenegegr, wasn't the best adaptation in the literary sense, as it took many liberties with the character of Conan. But where it failed to be faithful to Robert E. Howard, it still managed to understand what he had written and how he saw the world. Nispel on the other hand doesn't seem to really grasp the savage world of Conan nor really the world view of Howard.All in all, despite some very nice art direction, CtB is a soulless, directionless shell of a movie, that could have been good, but has been mangled by too many cooks.Only standout actor in the movie is Jason Momoa, who does fill the shoes of Conan very well, better than Arnold Schwarzenegger ever did, but because of the circumstances, the first Conan movie, that John Milius directed, still remains the best take of the character.",Conan the Barbarian
57,LazySod,Barely worthy of celluloid,6,22 August 2011,"One thing has to be said. The title holds true. This film is about Conan, and he's a barbarian. Story-wise there isn't that much to tell really. A guy gets born, grows up and learns the trick of the warrior trade by necessity. The same guy then starts roaming the world in seek of people to slay and barbaric acts to perform.I must admit I cannot remember how long ago it was that I saw the original films so I am not going into comparison. It can be said that this film is not going to win any prizes - but its more or less like its title character: crude but effective. The humorous touch is nice enough and the different characters get together pretty well.The visualisation of the fights and scenery are matching and the speed is nice, there's no sloppy bits that drag on for an indeterminate period of time. All in all, it's OK enough popcorn material, something to sit through on a bored evening.6 out of 10 skulls bashed",Conan the Barbarian
58,bheadher,Worse than the 1982 version?,3,8 November 2015,"How can any actor do a worse presentation than Arnold? Enter Jason Momoa...Even though Arnold always has trouble with English (and still does), Jason manages to surpass this, growling his lines much of the time.Add to that lack luster performance a few other no-name actors who can't seem to remember their lines, let alone deliver them in a coherent way, and you have a flop on your hands. Sure, there is plenty of action...but it all is delivered with such lack of choreography as to be laughable. The main antagonist Warlord even was so poorly delivered limp wrist uppercut with his sword that the victim warrior had to actually move into the swipe to try and make it look vaguely brutal.Overall, a poorly done movie, with few saving scenes at all...good looking women though, even if they needed some Acting 101.",Conan the Barbarian

It's certainly not great but I actually think it's better than the original. I saw the original just within the last year or so so I had no nostalgia for it and it certainly felt dated. The acting is pretty similar as Jason Mamoa is fairly wooden just as Arnold was. The fighting is pretty much even as well. The visuals and pacing seem better in this though in my opinion. It sort of felt like the first Scorpion King to me. Fun, campy, sword and sorcery nonsense.

This film is a blur of action, quick edits, CGI and cardboard characters. It had numbed my brain into abandoning all attempts at attention after about 20 minutes.

64,ericrnolan,"It's like ""The Lord of the Rings"" if it were an angry 13-year-old on steroids.",8,7 October 2014,"I'm not sure why so many people panned ""Conan the Barbarian"" (2011); I was pretty happy with it. I'd give it and 8 out 0f 10.Of course it cannot match the original. ""Conan the Barbarian"" (1982) is a camp classic. But I really doubt the filmmakers were trying to upstage Arnold and Co. They were simply trying to resurrect a profitable fantasy franchise, after Peter Jackson's success with ""The Lord of the Rings.""I was bracing myself for disappointment after all the bad advance press, then kept seeing various things that I really enjoyed. For starters, the kid who played young Conan, Leo Howard, is off the hook. He's a great child actor who was well cast; it's great seeing him alongside the always-awesome Ron Perlman.This is also a movie that is ""played straight."" There is absolutely no attempt to add cheese or humor in order to amp up the nostalgia factor, as so many other 80's remakes have done in recent years. This movie gives a fan of the original films (and the comics and novels) exactly what they want – a violent adolescent escapist fantasy. It's like ""The Lord of the Rings"" if it were an angry 13- year-old on steroids.There was very good fight choreography for the swordplay. Scenes are staged, blocked and shot so that you can actually follow the fights (a great ingredient in a ""guy movie."") Yes, it's bloody and gory and gratuitous – but, again, that's what true Conan fans are expecting.Feminists and Joss Whedon fans will be pleased by some nice use of strong female characters, both good and evil. And we have a fun (but too small) supporting role by the incredibly under-recognized Said Taghmaoui, of whom I've been a fan ever since his brilliant turn as an Iraqi interrogator in the classic ""Three Kings.""It isn't perfect. Some of the dialogue is just plain bad, for example. There are pacing problems. Conan here is much less interesting than the Schwarzenegger incarnation – the original Conan was a thief and a brute; sometimes he was only a great anti-hero because he was LESS of a jerk than so many people around him. Here, Conan is an altruist, freeing slaves from passing caravans on a whim. That's fine. But it does feel as though we're watching Sir Lancelot and not Conan the Barbarian.Also, for a film that seems loyal to its source material, there a surprising dearth of visible sorcery and few monsters. The Conan of the comics fought everything from zombie ninjas to coyote demons to giant scorpions. There was also another weird departure from the books and comics. Conan and his clan are  secularists? Huh? Did I hear that right? Any comics reader worth his salt knows that CONAN, LIKE ANY GOOD CIMMERIAN, WORSHIPS CROM. We know this because every time three- headed snake men surprise him from the shadows, he screams, ""CROM!"" as an expletive.Personal note: I was obviously a fan of the (rather subversive) comic books when I was a kid. When I was between the ages of 7 and 12, I would beg my parents to buy them for me when we stopped at the pharmacy after church in Wading River, NY. Then I carefully hid their contents. Hooboy. These books were violent; Conan eviscerated or beheaded at least half a dozen bad guys every issue. I can't remember if this was Marvel title or if it was produced independently. In retrospect, I get the sense that maybe a lot of this stuff wasn't approved by the Comics Code Authority (CCA). At any rate, the writing was fantastic, and the artwork was simply incredible, even though many of these books were in black and white. Great memories.http://ericrobertnolan.wordpress.com/",Conan the Barbarian

Howard stories are responsible for this film's incomprehensibly and unfairly underrated status. It's far superior to the earlier attempts and much truer to Howard's characterization. As a film it's also superior to such bloated and underwhelming projects as ""Prince of Persia"" and ""Gods of Egypt"" which were little more than boring big-screen video games with non-existent or nonsensical plots. The abundant action proceeds briskly and the film looks stunning. It's an excellent introduction to the Conan character with Jason Mamoa doing the barbarian proud.

67,martinrobertson300482,I'm not really into Sword and sorcery movies. But Conan seems too lead the way...,7,30 August 2011,"The Original ""Conan the barbarian"" was meant to be the beginning of a series. But for whatever reason only 2 films were ever made starring 80's action star Arnold Schwarzenegger. I don't know why they felt he was irreplaceable as the lead character (Although I like Arnold, I'm sure he was chosen for his muscles over his acting skills) seeing as the character had been around long before he ever was. This is what happened however, and so production on further ""Conan"" films stopped.Too me, it really feels like another Conan film is long over-due. The Only complaint I really have is that they chose to do a remake or reboot or whatever you want to call it when I'd off preferred them to do something different from every other franchise, and maybe just do another sequel. They'd have got away with that I think. Either way I guess this is intended to be the restart of a series they hope to get right this time, and from what I've heard, fans of the original ""Conan"" stories (who were less than thrilled by Schwarzeneggers efforts) are loving this so who am I to judge? As a stand alone movie I can honestly say that it REALLY didn't want me to be bored by it, but it kind off did get boring in parts because of its constant action and noise. The story was about as straight forward as they come, but some of the action was pretty cool and I was surprised by its violence and nudity. Not that these are good things but it made it all slightly different from other PG-13 Sword and sorcery films I've seen, and apparently reflects the style of the source material so it was all good.",Conan the Barbarian

I felt the story dragged in places and changed directions a couple of times. The actors weren't that handsome/attractive. There is something about Jason Momoa's face, syphilitic birth, genetic disorder? Rachel Nichols was attractive but she is playing a princess, aren't there any glamorous actresses in hollywood anymore?!? Many scenes seemed like slap stick action.

69,Tcarts76,A entertaining remake of a really bad movie,7,27 September 2012,"OK, yes, I gave this movie an 7, and here's why. It is what it is, Conan The Barbarian. It is a new remake of an old, low budget, Arnie Schwarzenegger, James Earl Jones movie that gained fame for arnie the Bodybuilder and attracted a somewhat oddball cult following. If you have never seen the original check it out, it fell into the category of so bad that it was good.This updated version very loosely follows the original, but mostly throws it out the window. It's a fantasy movie about a barbarian, people, so I don't want to hear other reviewers ripping it to shreds for not being Oscar worthy. When you watch a ""Barbarian"" movie, expect to be entertained by swords, blood, and death, which this one has. I won't get into any plot details here, you can scroll up and read them yourself because honestly this isn't a movie that is really watched for a detailed plot.This is far more of a visual pleasure than the old movie, and much more watchable then its 1980's puke of a movie. I do think it should have included more sex and debauchery, but thats just me. Rachel Nichols is the female lead that is told that she will meet a warrior, and of course Conan is it. She looks better in every movie she has done.So everyone out there trashing this movie, saying things like HBO does it better, guess what? Game of Thrones, Rome, and Spartacus (Spartacus sucked anyway) were well thought out drama's not remakes of a horrible 1980's no budget 'barbarian' movie, so put on your thinking caps and don't be an idiot thinking you are going to get another installment of your favorite boy love fest such as The Lord of the Rings, or The Hobbit. Conan isn't going to drive you from your mom's basement, make you turn off your World of Warcraft, or make you worship at the alter of a new avatar.

70,AdrenalinDragon,Soulless reboot with no identity,3,29 March 2021,"This Conan reboot was pretty terrible. While I didn't think the original Conan films were all that great, they at least had a certain charm and identity to them that made them feel like their own. This new Conan the Barbarian was so indistinguishable from any recent Fantasy Action movie that honestly I wouldn't have guessed Jason Momoa was supposed to be Conan. It could have been anyone and I wouldn't even realised it was supposed to be Arnold's equivalent. He doesn't have any personality here whatsoever.There's no memorable score, most of the action is generic filled with CGI blood, it's poorly shot and edited in many spots with slo-mo, everything feels fake, and outside of some decent actors being in here and maybe a fight or two, it's forgettable. Sure it has money behind it on production values, but like I said there's nothing that distinguishes this from a weak Fantasy Blockbuster. You could tell with the original there was heart and effort put into it, but this felt soulless and a waste of time. Avoid like the plague.2.5/10.",Conan the Barbarian
71,blrnani,"Disappointing, despite low expectations",4,5 February 2018,"Things got off to a poor start with Morgan Freeman's unconvincing audio introduction and the pause for Conan's father to perform a lightning C-section on his dying mother in the midst of a violent battle.
Then it started looking up, as we see the young Conan as an impetuous anger-filled youth who is already skillful enough to take down a group of marauders all on his own. He is then given good reason to be angry, as a new invader destroys his village and leaves him in an impossible situation trying to save his father's life. the father has the wisdom to end it himself, to assuage any guilt. But there's always revenge as a motive.
Then the youth has grown into a hulk (better explained in the Arny version), yet the rage seems to have evaporated, even if the desire for revenge still drives him. Nonso Anozie is a fun character who leaves all too soon (and will be disappointed the flop is unlikely to generate the equel he deserved). Then we meet the ambiguous Rachel Nichols, who one moment is an admirable self-sufficient match for Conan and the next is behaving like a helpless screamy slasher movie victim.
Stephen Lang's villain is of Shakespearean roots, more prone to explaining his villainy than actually inspiring terror. And as for Rose McGowan's witch, it must make even the most ardent appreciators of her denunciation wonder what Weinstein saw in her in the first place (perhaps weirdness inspires weirdness).
The combined result is that, for all the action, one finds oneself not really caring much about the outcome, especially as it is clearly established that good will overcome evil (ok, so Bond always wins, but at least there are convincing obstacles in his way).
The whole thing makes me wonder what we reasonably expect from a Conan film. The Arny original is a classic, but despite nice touches and humour the three weren't exactly great movies, let's be honest. I suppose the closest to the ideal was Vin Diesel in The Chronicles of Riddick, with a great warrior who is also clever and whose qualities attract followers to the cause. If he has to be muscle bound then I suppose one thinks of Dwayne Johnson in The Scorpion King. The key is a good story that is convincingly acted (room for humour and romance optional).",Conan the Barbarian

Nonetheless, what we get here is an enjoyable and gory sword-and-sorcery movie, with impressive (or at least very entertaining) swordsmanship, fight choreography, and the general theatrics of all of it is straightforward fun. When I first watched this movie I was very disappointed, because I tried comparing it to the original. But watching it as its own movie, it's good for what it is.

When he brandished his humongous sword and swung, nothing else really stood a chance, and all you remembered at the end of each scene were those mesmerizing muscles. The choice then was pretty simple- you either worshipped Sylvester Rocky Stallone, or Arnold Conan Schwarzenegger, and i proudly belonged to the latter club. So when the movie that made him endured a remake in 2011, it naturally made me curious, and more than a tad expectant. A cult classic sword and sorcery remade with a rising action star, big budget effects instead of the campy, and of course, a million pounds of fan- expectations.But then remakes suck, right? And so did this disgrace of a movie which started to suck right from the first scene where they show Conan being birthed right in the middle of a battle. And in this genre of movies, the plot is of little consequence as they always follow the revenge theory. Conan's father and tribe is slaughtered blah blah blah...Conan wants revenge blah blah blah....lots of people die in his quest for revenge blah blah blah. What made the 1982 version a classic was, besides Arnold, the portrayal of a dark and desolate world, complete with savagery and sorcery. This one just moves from one action set piece to the other. Coming to the good part- is the action, no longer ponderous but fast, no longer basic parry and thrusts, but much more stylized and pleasing to the eye, more like a dance most fight sequences were. The violence is gruesome, but after a while, even those without a taste for blood will start to appreciate it, because frankly, this is all the movie has got. Jason Momoa played Khal Drogo with panache in Game of Thrones, and here he takes it a couple of notches higher. Arnold, for all his physical perfection never really was a natural to action, Momoa, on the other hand takes to it as a fish takes to water. There is this perennial bloodlust in his eyes, as also in the little guy who plays junior Conan in the early part of the movie. But then what maketh a star? Charisma! And since Arnold had oodles of that, Momoa had big shoes to fill in, and he turns up short. If a great hero makes an action movie enjoyable, a kickass villain makes the confrontation, and hence the movie, memorable. Sadly, Conan the Barbarian has an incompetent villain, one who couldn't even scare a cat, let alone enslave the world. Can all of us movie fans sign petitions to stop remakes? Remakes taint childhood memories. My memories are dear to me. Watch Conan the Barbarian without too much expectation, maybe you will come out with only a wince.",Conan the Barbarian
77,lovecraft231,The end result feels lukewarm,4,23 November 2011,"When it was announced that a remake/reboot of one of my favorite action movies, the John Millus sword n' sorcery classic ""Conan the Barbarian"", I was one of many that was unsure of the idea. I mean, on one hand, I think it's not the best idea, but on the other, the 82 movie is more Millus and Oliver Stone's take on ""Conan"" than it is the Robert E. Howard creation. I didn't see the movie in theaters, so now that it's on DVD and Blu-Ray, let's take a look.Opening with a prologue narrated by Morgan Freeman (okay then...), we learn that Conan was born on the battlefield. By that, I mean his father Corin (Ron Perlman) delivered a c-section on his mom during battle. Why a pregnant woman is fighting in war is beyond me, but hey. Years later, young Conan (Leo Howard) watches his village and people become destroyed, and his father killed by warlord Khalar Zym (Steven Lang) and his men.As an adult (Jason Momoa), Conan is a thief and pirate, who finds Lucius (Steven O'Donnell), who was one of Zym's men that he disfigured as a child. After getting some information out of him about the whereabouts of Zym, he finds out that he's a name known across Hyboria, and he and his daughter Marquis (Rose McGowan) are searching for the pure blood princess Tamara (Rachael Nichols) so they can bring back Zym's wife and enslave humanity. So now, Conan must save the princess and save the world in the process of his quest for vengeance.If there's anything the new ""Conan"" really gets right, it's the casting of Momoa as Conan. Simply put, he feels more like the Conan of the stories, as he's not just some brute. He's intelligent, hatches plans, has goals, and can talk fluently as well as he can go into violent rage. The action scenes are also very well done, and bloody as hell, while the sets look like the Hyborian age of the stories. Also, Perlman does fine work as Conan's father, and Lang delivers a fun (albeit scenery chewing) performance. McGowan meanwhile...she's not good, but she vamps it up so much that I kinda liked her. Finally, while it's nowhere near as great as the original, the score by Tyler Bates does it's job-I especially like the Celtic touches.Sadly, that's where the positives end. For one thing, the direction by Marcus Nispel (whose ""Friday the 13th"" remake I enjoyed) is the definition of nondescript, as little of it feels epic or fun, and lacks the edge of the original. The story meanwhile, is incredibly dumb, and feels like it was rejected by the SyFy channel, while the script is filled with holes and bad dialog (while Momoa is great, I had to cringe when he delivered lines like ""I don't want your gold-I want your head!"") The conclusion is also lacking, as it feels anticlimactic, while the rest of the performances-especially Nichols-are all pretty poor.Which leads to my biggest complaint-the movie lacks fun for the most part. Sure, the action scenes look great, and there's moments that let us know how much of a bad-ass Conan is, but as a whole, it doesn't have the adventurous, pulpy greatness of the original stories. This is a movie with a man who doesn't take any s#!t, has a code of honor, and is an all around certifiable bad motherf@@#er who gets girls, kills villains and is tougher than nails. Yet, while it has a great Conan, the story, direction and plotting feel beneath such a character. The end result feels more like a studio patch-job in which they went ""Okay, we've got a well known property, let's do make a movie with it"" without doing much and ignoring what the final product might look like.It's a real shame too, because there's some stuff I really like here, and there's a fun movie hidden somewhere. However, the end result just feels lukewarm, and isn't anywhere near as enjoyable as it should be.",Conan the Barbarian
78,Ar_Pharazon_the_golden,New ideas required,5,25 August 2011,"The problem with Conan is one most films of heroic fantasy seem to have and it's the scenario. You don't expect deep meaning or indulging in philosophical quests, but you'd think they could do more with the characters and the dialogue. Jason Momoa is good as Conan, but then again he doesn't have to do much more than hacking and slashing. The secondary characters, including the girl, are just supplementary so he can talk to someone. The villains, who should in my opinion be the most complex, aren't much better either. Stephen Lang may be a good actor but doesn't do much with Khalar Zym, even though there was some room for character development. As for Rose McGowan, I'll remember her kinky outfits, but with around 15 lines in the film, most of which are variations of the same, that's about it. Ron Pearlman seems to be the only one who can put some soul in his short, but memorable role. Other than that, the battles, landscapes and atmosphere were good, if unsurprising (except for some fallen columns in the middle of the forest - didn't someone see that this is simply non-sensical? Who put the columns there without the rest of the building - without even cutting the trees!?). What could have, despite all these, saved the film, would be a soundtrack such as the unsurpassable one for the 82 film. Even the narrator there sounded so much better. But that was the one thing you couldn't really ask for. All in all, it's certainly not a waste of time and money to watch the movie, but I just wish they bothered to work more on it - the swordfight/kinky dress/dangerous bridge formula doesn't work so well anymore.",Conan the Barbarian
79,Jonathon_Natsis,A meandering cluster of 'been there's' and 'done thats.',3,31 August 2011,"Another month, another pointless, Hollywood, cash cow remake. But this one is a little different. As is the case with most uninspired reboots, the audience leaves the cinema, agreeing almost in unison that no man or woman should have ever attempted to remake such a classic film in the first place. This is not the case for Conan The Barbarian (a remake of its 1982 namesake starring The Governator), only because the original isn't exactly considered a masterpiece in its own right. Unfortunately, that doesn't mean we ought to treat this modern adaptation with any greater leniency.Conan (Jason Momoa) was always destined to be a warrior, born on the battlefield and raised to be a skilled fighter by his father Corin (Ron Perlman). After he is forced to watch the murder of his father at the hands of Khalar Zym (Stephen Lang), we fast-forward twenty years, at which point Conan continues to seek revenge. This leads him on a perilous journey on which he must save Hyboria and seek personal restitution against the man who slaughtered his family and village.The quality of the script is almost a moot point at this stage, and I fear such a criticism is becoming a recurring theme every time I review a film of this nature. I don't need to go on about the excess of clichés and failure to use dialogue as a means of character development because, quite frankly, it's all been said before. I'll just start and end by saying it offers no food for thought, nor was it expected to.If the title of the review hasn't already given it away, I didn't enjoy Conan. But in fairness, the only aspects blockbuster films like this try to leave in the mind of the viewer are the set pieces. In that respect, the action scenes were not terrible and, at the risk of pointing out the obvious once again, you can definitely see where most of the seventy million dollar budget went. All action scenes show a decent amount of technical production and attention to detail, but they are let down by lazy camera-work, employing the old 'zoom- in-really-close-and-leave-the-audience-disoriented' trick (not unlike the style employed in fellow swords and sorcery remake Clash of the Titans). But for anyone going to see this film just for the stylised killings, you'll be pleased to hear gore is on high enough supply to garner an R rating. And trust me, it is justified.Conan The Barbarian's flaws range from minor to significant as the film progresses. For instance, Perlman makes no (or at least, minimal) effort to shed his American accent for the role of Corin, while early scenes depicting the birth of Conan and the way he fights off half a dozen seasoned warriors on his own as a teenager require a huge suspension of disbelief. Which, by the way, is the polite way of saying they make no sense. Some time later, we are treated to a 'mentor-protégé' training montage that manages to rip off Star Wars and Batman Begins in the process. I know, I of all people am often guilty of crossing the fine line between discerning adaptation and plagiarism, but the blatancy in this instance is almost laughable.As the film draws to a close, the sheer mundanity of the plot gets to the point where, in retrospect, my eyes, ears and mind have been taking in and understanding the events of each scene, but I have never truly engaged with the story. Throw in a predictable ending to finish and you've got one of the most unnecessary movies of the season, and maybe even the year.*There's nothing I love more than a bit of feedback, good or bad. So drop me a line on jnatsis@iprimus.com.au and let me know what you thought of my review.*",Conan the Barbarian
80,TheRadiobox,Re-Whatever.,3,15 June 2020,"Conan the Barbarian is Directed by Marcus Nispel, the director of the remakes of Texas Chainsaw Massacre and Friday the 13th, alongside the similar Pathfinder. While I wouldn't call myself a huge fan of any of those movies, I do think they're all decent. This one, not so much.The plot is straightforward and to-the-point. It's a revenge tale; hard to mess that up. The characters are all about what you'd expect for the most part but all too forgettable and mostly poorly performed. The cast here is talented, but they aren't given very much to work with. Jason Momoa is awful as Conan, showing little to no screen presence which is something he clearly has (see Braven) but isn't able to let it show. The same applies to Rachel Nichols and Nonso Anozie. Stephen Lang is bad in Conan too, overacting throughout every scene and having an odd and disappearing accent in some scenes but not in others. Rose McGowan is what was expected: a trainwreck. And Perlman is Perlman.Internal logic is spotty at best as well, with ""Tamara"" who is a monk from a passive land being able to fight alongside Conan and survive an encounter with Khalar Zym who is supposedly the most fearsome warrior of them all, but shortly after not being able to handle 3 goons. ""Artus"" suffers too; only being a deus ex machina for Conan when he and Tamara need an escape. Other than that the writing is flawed and relatively uninteresting.Technical aspects are tolerable at times and terrible at others. The action sequences are fine, with nothing standing out in a good way, and there are a few scenes where the hand of the second unit director can clearly be felt with lots of unnecessary cuts and edits. The production design, however, is great. The locations look real and the costumes are believable. Cinematography is decent, with none of the shots coming even close to the beauty of Nispel's previous works. The CGI is mostly awful too, especially one scene involving a sea creature.More often than not; Conan the Barbarian falters more than it succeeds. With a mixture of a generic plot, villain, and action alongside hammy and flat performances, and a final act that is a positively abysmal mess of bad CGI and choreography, it doesn't have much to stand on aside from the character's reputation. If you want a good remake of a sword-and-sandals classic, see 2010's ""Clash of the Titans.""38/100",Conan the Barbarian
81,iantrader,He's not Arnie...,4,30 September 2016,"The problem with doing a remake is that it really, really needs to be better than the original. For S&S fans, that's going to be a tough job. But it's always easier to get finance for a 'proven concept' than an original one. You'd have thought they'd have learned their lesson by now but apparently not.Having said that, this isn't a direly bad film, it's just not a particularly good one. Is that an oxymoron? Anyway, it certainly falls short in comparison to the two originals which is a shame because there is a lot of 'Conan' left to explore, but this just doesn't get to the heart of the characters or story/plot. If you look at the sequence of events, it can seem rather contrived (maybe you're not supposed to do that).The goodies and allies are good and the baddies are suitably bad and, of course, get their comeuppance - comeuppance is always good, isn't it. There are some interesting set pieces and the production values are superb but the editor (stand up Ken Blackwell) could do with a little less caffeine while he's copying and pasting. In case no one's told him - which they obviously haven't - fast cutting doesn't make scenes more interesting or exciting, just more boring and confusing. Hey ho...Momoa may be a good actor but, judging from from this movie, the jury's still out. Ron Perlman is at his gruff, solid and earnest best. Lang (in spite of some corny lines which he still delivers well), Nichols and McGowan are excellent and Nonso Anzoie as Conan's sidekick is superb! More Nonso, please!But neither they - nor the copious amounts of action - can make up for a rather derivative script and iffy direction. And what's his predilection with dark? It's not more menacing, threatening, scary, intriguing, mysterious or mystical - you just wonder why they spent so much on production if you can't see it.Watch it and enjoy it on a lazy Sunday afternoon but don't expect any of the magic of the original.I'm scoring it higher than it probably deserves but, heck, it's a Sunday afternoon.",Conan the Barbarian
82,ThreeGuysOneMovie,the script was as smelly as a Cimmerians horse after battle.,4,26 May 2012,"I thought the film was a fairly decent hack and slash fantasy film that lost steam about one third of way through. There was plenty of action, swords, blood and breasts as there should be in any Robert E. Howard sword and sorcery tale. But the script was as smelly as a Cimmerians horse after battle.I thought the film started out really well and I enjoyed the origin story. Unfortunately, it wasn't long before the film lost its way. I found myself telling the characters what not to do and they would go and do it anyway, just to move the plot along. There were also lots of day night changes that did not make any sense.

83,lois-lane33,Very shoddy filmmaking.,1,4 October 2014,"This film contains more errors than a stream of 1970's computer programming. The lighting is done wrong-maybe in an attempt to emulate the dark paintings of Frank Frazetta, the master painter of sword & sorcery images-which crucifies the film from start to finish-the script doesn't respect the story of Conan much at all and is full of incomprehensible grunts. There is also no way Conan would have trouble lifting a 100 pound woman (played by Rachel Nichols)-and there are also other errors-knocking a board out from a bridge magically causes the films villain to fall to his death whilst he has a magical mask strapped to his face that has all the power of hell attached to it. In short-an absolute flop of a movie. In the intro in the special features section of the DVD they talk about the history of the Conan saga but incorrectly say that Arnold Shwarzenegger did one Conan film when he in fact had done two-Conan The Barbarian & Conan The Destroyer. Both of which were a head and shoulders above this crude humorless mess of a movie that wasn't even saved by the use of an actor who was in fact perfect for the role of Conan. To kill a character so totally takes a specific skill set that you don't see very often. This film has my vote for second worst movie of the modern era-since nobody has managed to surpass Tom Cruises mid 80's dill 'Legend' for stinking cinema, but this one comes close. I cannot believe that the folk who made this movie ever liked Conan.",Conan the Barbarian
84,quinnox-1,As bad as everyone says it is,3,24 August 2011,"I went to see this despite the bad press, thinking maybe it just wasn't appealing to the mainstream, and that perhaps it might be better than what people were saying.I was wrong. This is a terrible movie, and it deserves all the bad reviews and publicity it gets for being a box office bomb.I should have saved my money like just about everyone else did and skipped it. There were only about 4 or 5 other people in the entire theater I went to see it in so I guess we were the chumps. Abysmal acting, directing, fight scenes, story, and the lead villain seems to be about 90 years old and might need a walker. I mean seriously, what were they thinking? The only good thing about the movie was the kid who played the young Conan during the beginning, he was great in the part and I wish the whole movie would have been about him instead of the grown up version of Conan. On the other hand, Jason Momoa had no screen presence at all and it was clear he can't carry this movie as the lead character.This was a massive fail and besides the one bright spot I mentioned (the actor who played kid Conan) everything else was just awful.",Conan the Barbarian
85,JPfanatic93,"There is only one Conan, and he does not share power",6,23 September 2013,"Re-imagination of the Conan franchise and the barbarian character itself, first immortalized by Arnold Schwarzenegger in 1982. Jason Momoa (the former Khal Drogo on the brilliant HBO show Game of Thrones) has big boots to fill indeed, and does it adequately enough judging by the size of his biceps and the lack of subtlety and talent for murder displayed in his take on Conan. This sleeker, more modern action flick retells the origins of Conan, keeping close to Schwarzenegger's Conan the Barbarian (1982) combined with some elements from Conan the Destroyer (1984), starting of as a wild child who witnesses his tribe massacred and his beloved father (Ron Perlman!) viciously put to death at the hands of the evil tyrant king Khalar Zym (Stephen Lang once again failing to portray a truly disdainful antagonist as he did on Avatar (2009)). Seeking revenge in the long run, Conan at first sticks to the life of a thief and a pirate, until he picks up Zym's trace again and slashes his way to the top through a long row of creepy henchmen, delivering some decent action scenes and rescuing a beautiful lady of royal blood (Rachel Nichols) in the process. This princess is intended as a human sacrifice so Zym and his maniacal sorceress daughter (a delightful Rose McGowan who is obviously having a ball here) can summon the powers of an ancient mask and conquer the world. Of course Conan doesn't make it easy for them, resulting in a string of violent fisticuffs, intense moments of swords hacking into human flesh and overly digital monsters to be fought, basically the ingredients most spectators would have expected. Overall a fairly entertaining action film, certainly the best in director Marcus Nispel's repertoire (which isn't saying much with movies like Pathfinder (2007) and Friday the 13th (2009) on his score), but never truly special and certainly not as iconic as Schwarzenegger's original portrayal of the classic Robert E. Howard character. The movie did rather poorly at the box office, despite being released in 3-D (though for most of the film you wouldn't have noticed this), so we probably won't be hearing from Conan for a while.

86,kenstallings-65346,Should have never been made,4,3 May 2021,"If you choose to re-do a classic, you better ensure the second effort is worthy of the first. A few times, that is done, notably with True Grit, but more often you get something far below the original such as with this remake of Conan the Barbarian.The plot does not draw heavily on the original, which is good, but the plot fails to capitalize on the missing elements from the original. An outstanding plot would have been one that focused on the episodes after the original concluded, the rise of Conan to lord of his own domain.But, that never happened. And so, we are left with a movie that tries to ply the same territory as the original, without looking like the original. And that leaves very little avenue for success.Considering what a commercial failure it turned out to be, the financial losses had to be recouped to some degree by releasing it. Still, the better choice would have been to review the planned script and refuse to green light the effort, force a rewrite to explore the open territory, and release something that could have filled a sought after void that the promised trilogy of the original efforts never delivered on.Once the production decision was made, with the script provided, the rest was inevitable and unworthy.",Conan the Barbarian
87,axismladen,"The one and only reason i'm giving it a five is because Clash Of The Titans, which is five times worse, has a higher rating!",5,4 September 2011,"I don't know why it's so widely accepted by filmmakers, but a Conan movie must start with his family being slaughtered. This, of course, has nothing to do with the original Conan. By original i mean on Robert E. Howard's stories and not on Millius' 1982 movie adaptation. This Conan movie, like 1982 version, starts with his village being destroyed, all his loved one's killed, and young Conan surviving and becoming a strong warrior searching for vengeance.For a long time i've been waiting for new Conan to be made. I was kinda hoping that whoever ends up making it will take it seriously and not just try to make a money making franchise, which they tried to do, but failed since the movie didn't do good at the box office. A lot of directors, producers and writers have been attached to the project over the years, but none of them sticked with it which shows who even considered making this movie. It surely wasn't someone who had any sort of passion for it. Except, maybe and probably, the passion for money only. And don't get me wrong, it's common sense that no one will invest into something that he/she thinks won't bring the profit. But just because you're trying to make money doesn't mean you shouldn't be trying to make a good movie also. If Conan one day finds it self in the right hands, i'm sure it'll be a good movie and a money maker, both. Unfortunately for us fans, and as it seems for them too, this time around it wasn't either of those things.When i first heard that the same person that directed Pathfinder, Marcus Nispel, is set to direct new Conan my hopes and general enthusiasm went quite low. Though, i remained hopeful that miracle will happen. In vein, unfortunately. I also wasn't excited about Sean Hood writing it. This was a disaster formula all around. Than i read SH's blog where he wrote how he's a good writer but that the studios always change scripts from good to terrible because they think they'll make more money that way. This gave me some of my hope back but, whether it's the studios or just him writing a bad script, i came back to reality as soon as the movie started, in one of the dumbest first fifteen minutes i've ever seen. I won't say too much, but let's say that there is a super dumb baby delivering scene and than some other stupid scenes including young Conan...!Than, of course, after several actors were considered and even set for the part, Jason Momoa was cast as the most famous Barbarian of all times. This was, like many things about the whole project, disappointing. I thought he's way better than anyone who's been speculated to take the role so far, but still not the right choice. I've seen him in some TV series and figured he can't act. Of all the things about this movie, i never thought that he'll be the one to prove me wrong. Glad he did. He's nothing like the trailer suggests. He's not this wooden, rusty voiced, irritating guy. Instead, he does a very good job. Well, i wouldn't go too far so i'll just say that he's definitely not what i thought he'll be and i wouldn't be mad if he played the role again. There isn't really a lot of acting in a Conan movie, but he has his ways with the sword. Like i said, he's much better than the trailer suggests and my excitement could be coming because i thought he'll be terrible, but still, i think he did a good job and wouldn't mind seeing him again.The only two things that could be called good about the whole movie are action and violence. Visuals are average, music decent, but far from being more, cinematography too plastic and fantasy like, and so on.. There is one cool, barbaric nose fingering scene and a couple of cool action sequences, but that's about it. Also, i think the entire picture went to hell in the last 30 minutes. The ending location and the ending it self are just awful. The entire picture was literally moved from sand beaches and stuff to a Mordor like sewer.Another bad thing is that the entire movie is extremely predictable. It was expected to be, but did they really have to put every cliché they could find in it?! And the last fight sucked hard. Fights, that is. Choreography was fine through out, but they messed it up badly with the most important part! The most important part as far as action choreography goes, anyways. Which the entire movie is made off, actually. Fights, fights and some more fights. I wouldn't even mind the fact that i knew from the very beginning that a woman will fight a woman, and that a man will fight a man, but when you make something the ultimate destination of the entire movie and your leading character, which is Conan fighting Khalar and so on, you can at least make something spectacular out of it.And why is Conan constantly stabbing his sword in the ground? Scene after scene after scene... At the end of every fight he stabs his sword in the ground. Or holds it up high. Can anyone tell me why? Can't he just put it on his back or something? Or anything, but stab it in the ground?!? Like it says in the summery, i'm giving it five only because Clash Of The Titans, which is five times worse, has a higher rating. Usually i'd probably give it a four. Wouldn't recommend it, but it's not boring. Expect nothing and you'll get something, expect something and you'll be disappointed! 2.5 / 6",Conan the Barbarian
88,drew_atreides,The whole does not equal the sum of it's parts,7,22 August 2011,"I have to admit i went in wanting to like this new Conan. There were some interesting actors in place here. Stephen Lang was solid in ""Avatar"", Rose McGowan is someone i've had a secret love for since ""SCREAM"", and her participation in ""Grind House"" cemented her status as a B-movie favourite, and being a Stargate Fan i knew what Jason Momoa could bring to the table. He had all the tools to fill the sandals and loin cloth of Conan, along with an undeniably brooding screen presence.These 3 at the core give a valiant effort, but i don't think any actor could save this fairly poorly spliced together schlock. I think the direction is the weak point. There's definitely some solid makeup work, and the action scenes are conceptually pretty cool. But the way they were executed and actually filmed left a lot to be desired, and near the end of the film it seems like the editing went to pot.Still, for gore-fiends there's definitely some appeal here. There's an undeniable brutality to the violence. I have to admit i was cringing a couple of times!Overall, though, a bit of a wasted opportunity. There was some neat pieces in place here, but it's all for naught. Too bad. McGowan's performance alone was definitely worthy of a more fleshed out character in a better film.To be honest i want to give this a 6.5/10, but I am rounding up to a very generous 7.Disappointed.",Conan the Barbarian

What exactly did you think you were going to watch? Secondly, have any of you even seen the original? It sucks quite a lot.Okay. So the 2011 remake isn't exactly high art, nor is it going to make many ""Best of..."" lists, but it is fun, consistent and decently acted. The original was quite dark, and while this remake doesn't match that, the script flows better, and overall is more watchable.Fun: lot of gore (quite gratuitously so); average plot (again, what did you think it was going to be?); hot babes - Rachel Nichols (and some nudie ones as well); swords, sorcery and dirty, pre-hot running water days.Consistent: the film never gets too serious, but it's not cheesy either. It keeps a consistent tone throughout. The ending is a bit weak, but that's largely a minor flaw, since the rest of the film carries it. The plot is average, and nothing spectacular, but that's okay.Acting: not too bad, actually. Jason Momoa was pretty good. In the original, Arnie has a certain screen presence, and Jason wasn't anywhere near that, but he did okay. The baddie (from Avatar) was okay. Rachel Nichols is gorgeous, and smoking hot as a brunette. I don't know if it was her in the sex scene (or a body double), but I like to think so. Rose McGowan was a bit weird, and kind of didn't fit in well (or at least the character didn't), and was the only weak link as far as acting goes.Overall, 8 out of 10.

90,thewillt08,Just Another Average Remake of an Average Movie,3,9 December 2012,"Conan the Barbarian is just one of those movies, well, here we go. What can I really say about this movie? It is the remake of Conan the Destroyer with Arnold Schwarzenegger and I had very low expectations going in. Coming out they just barely passed those expectations. Conan the Barbarian is about Conan trying to avenge the murder of his parents and stop some sort of evil plot. The story itself was far-fetched but it wasn't all bad. The characters were cool, they looked great, and the action scenes were exactly what you would expect. Conan meets a woman and they fall in love and its very cliché, almost cute, and it doesn't really work. It doesn't make the movie worse but it made it very predictable. Conan himself is an interesting character. The very first scene in the movie is his battle born birth. Conan was literally born in battle and his mother died giving birth to him. What was a pregnant woman doing in a battle? Even if it was a pillaging, why would she stay? Either way the scene was pointless and could have easily been mentioned later in the story. Oh wait, it was. The opening scene was just disturbing. A baby born, covered in blood, and Conan's father rising him in the air like he was hoisting up Simba. Other than the first scene the beginning of the movie was quite enjoyable. Kid Conan was an animal and way better than adult Conan. His first scene he takes out this group of, will I'm not sure what they are, people, maybe? Anyway, he takes them out and carries back their heads. He made himself a warrior that day and proved to his village he was going t be great. He passed the challenge and then some. He is a crazy warrior as a kid and is just epic. The kid actor did awful job acting but he played his role. As an adult Conan kills people in some of the coolest ways possible but its cheesy line after another. The movie would have been so much better is Conan didn't really speak at all. He is a smart warrior and a creative man, but a terrible speaker. The prologue had a back story of some mask that was destroyed and can make a mortal man a god. I really don't know, it was silly. That is the goal of the bad guys in the movie. Become a god and take over the world, I guess. They looked great. The CGI looked great and the movie itself wasn't as much CGI as I expected. It wasn't like Immortals that was 100% CGI and no story. At least Conan tried. The scene I hated the most was when the lady Wolverine thing just made dust monsters appear out of nowhere. That entire scene just looked terrible. When they were stabbed or ""killed"" they just disintegrated into dust. Just make them human. It would look so much better.Overall, Conan the Barbarian was disappointing. It was an action based movie with a poor attempt for a story. It excelled in one or two points but as a whole it was just frustrating. See it once to enjoy some good action and special effects but don't expect anything special. Conan the Barbarian joins a very elite group in getting the WillyT Seal of DISapproval.",Conan the Barbarian

92,AzSumTuk,The sad story of a good movie,8,7 November 2011,"This is not a great movie. I think I should start by saying it. It is just great entertainment that deserved a much better fate...DISCLAIMER: This review is written very harshly. If you like the 1982 Conan movie or you are an Arnold Schwarzenegger fanboy, skip it. You will hate it.As I said, this movie did not deserve to bomb so badly. Sadly, it did, and that was due to a few things.First, it had the worst marketing campaign that I have EVER seen. I don't know who were the idiots responsible for its' marketing and distribution but I hope they will never ruin any movie again. First, they released the real trailers too late. Second, they released the R-rated trailer too much time later than they released the PG-13 trailer. Both things are huge mistakes. The ""teaser"" that was released first was just HORRIBLE. You remember it - the one with the mummies dancing before some green smoke or something like that. It looked cheaper than a trailer of SyFy movie and it didn't build any positive expectations even among the greatest Howard fans. The PG-13 trailer was much better but it made the movie look similar to 'Prince of Persia' - and that built the wrong expectations and made a lot of people hate the movie before they saw it. After the evil was done they released the real, red band trailer. But it was too late. Now, I get why did they release a PG-13 trailer. What I don't get is why did they delay the R rated trailer that much. It was a stupid marketing decision. What is worse, after they failed with the trailers, the producers of the movie made an even worse mistake - they decided to release the movie only in 3D in most places. Didn't these idiots read the millions of comments written by people who hate 3D? How about the people who get headache, nausea or dizziness from the 3D movies? And how about the fact that almost every movie that was shot in 2D and then converted in 3D looked like cr@p in 3D? Judging by the reviews that is what happened to CtB for various reasons - rushed converting, the fact that the movie is shot and edited like a contemporary action movie with short cuts and some shaky cam in some scenes, etc... Not to mention the fact that many people refuse to pay for the overpriced tickets of the 3D screenings. That is it. People already know that 3D is a gimmick to make them pay more but to see less.Of course, even the worst marketing wouldn't tank an otherwise good movie so badly if it weren't for other factors. Did you see my DISCLAIMER above? Read it again, please. Don't say I didn't warn you.The other factor were the Arnold Schwarzenegger's fanboys. I am sorry but too many of these people deserve a horrible, painful death. Too many of these people are brainless idiots. These idiots did everything possible to kill the movie. There were a lot of fake reviews written on many sites describing how horrible the movie is. There were a lot of bogus 1-s on sites like IMDb.com. The ""No Arnold - no Conan"" topics on every single movie message board or forum in the world were countless. And why? Because their precious body builder with the acting talent of a tree starred in the most overrated piece of sh!t in the fantasy movie genre - the 1982 movie called 'Conan the Barbarian'. These idiots failed to acknowledge the simple fact that Arnold's character had NOTHING to do with Conan. Arnold's character was not even a barbarian! That is what angers me a lot. Arnold's character was everything that the real Conan IS NOT - a slave, a gladiator, a lumbering idiot who is as slow as a snail and is barely able to speak. Milius and Stone literally STOLE the name of the real Conan and cashed in on his fame. Stone even wanted to place the story in a post-apocalyptic futures. Whoever says this is not true is just an idiot, and that is an absolute FACT. Don't you agree with me? That would be like not agreeing with the fact that the sea is full of water. I am not stating opinions, I am stating FACTS. And the fact that the old movie is not true to the real Conan is the least of its' problems. Try to look at it with your fanboy glasses off and you will see for yourself how incredibly lame it is and how terrible it is when it comes to acting, script, editing and action - especially when it comes to action. The 1982 movie contains the worst sword fights that one can see in such a cult movie.To sum it up - the 1982 movie is a piece of sh!t. It is badly written, terribly acted, horribly choreographed and awfully directed, and it cashed in on the name of a famous and beloved character. Its' only saving grace is its' score. Sadly, Arnoldheads are too busy licking Arnold's shoes and can't see that. That is why they flooded the Internet with hatred towards the new movie and created fake word of mouth about the new movie. That is why they killed it. Being the idiots that they are, they destroyed everyone's chance of seeing a high budget R-rated fantasy movie again. Good for you, Arnoldheads. As someone on the movie's message board said, I hope you enjoy your big stinking pile of NOTHING. I have nothing against people who liked the old movie or despised the new one. However I had to report a few fake reviews here - they were written by idiots who had obviously not seen the movie but trashed it anyway. I dedicate what I wrote here to them.",Conan the Barbarian
93,Pingo-2,Looks great - is boring.,5,6 November 2011,"Extremely well made. Looks wonderful. Child actors in the first 30 minutes are super impressive. Actually, ALL actors in the film are impressive! So are the action, the music, the sound effects, the CGI - everything is impressive! Except one thing and that is Conan the character. He's Superman without cryptonite. Which makes him completely boring. Which makes the movie boring.Sadly, but the film is so well made that they forgot to make the main character interesting. Well - if you have a billion dollars and don't care about what you're doing, this is what you end up with.Schwarzenegger's version was more entertaining - this one looks better.If you're looking for a movie - rent the 1982-version.If you're looking for something visually cool - watch this.5/10",Conan the Barbarian

Gzeus these guys are really trying too hard over simple ideas.CGI ? In Conan ? Who the heck thought this was a good idea anyways...just shoot him and hire a team of old school special fx guys so we can finally watch a good movie. We want to have fun with it not experience the CGI crap like Prometheus. The director don't know how to shoot a film without CGI ? Shoot him too and hire another.This is the Playmobil version of Conan. Sometimes I think that the creators did Arnold a huge favor so he may die laughing because of this film.",Conan the Barbarian
95,TheHrunting,He'll shoulder press you AND the army you came with,5,21 August 2011,"As much as I enjoy the 1982 film, I'm going to review this as its own separate experience. The story element for the ""Conan the Barbarian"" 2011 felt pretty straightforward, as potential for more weighty subject matter was there but wasn't always emphasized, rather than jumping into one showy scene after the next. The quick pacing doesn't always give breathing room to think instead of a share of it just passing through. Since it doesn't always take advantage of one place for long, it often does itself a disservice for replay value when there aren't many layers to peel back.A boy born in battle is destined to be a warrior, he grows up at first somewhat small and unappreciated, has another family member taken away from him and then seeks revenge at a much later time in his life when the villain so happens to be close to his master plan. It felt like too many flashy scenes surrounded by little substance of narrative to fully clench its epic proportions. It did give off certain sensations the first time around, I'll give it that, though there wasn't much to ponder on below the surface about the characters or the journey after it ended.Jason Momoa held a presence of his own with a bulky and commanding physique, even if not ridiculously cut to the point of striation. He has a distinctive look on screen and a booming, almost professional wrestler voice. He appeared tough with some added scars and a deadpan stare, but ultimately well balanced when he was naturally wielding a sword like he owned it. Now, that's just his presence, because as for his aura there's not much else in the way of creating mystery about him, a relating ideology beyond the sword or fully capturing someone who's torn up with emotions about his lost relatives and village. He pretty much just moves from one place to the other with a loose strategy plan and it doesn't make this as gripping as the filmmakers intended with the fast flow.The movie is very bombastic. There are various macho guy vs macho guy action scenes that include a share of candid blood shed and cruel wounds to show for it without pulling away. A particular creature scene with sand spirits was an inventive addition as they can appear from all around. There's a tad of humor, T and A nudity, a short lived love connection which leads to rescuing the damsel in distress, and then various sets of the real and CGI type that give presence of being splendid to dismal. Some of the dialogue and character setups give a sense of grand scope, though others can go over the mark to the point of hokiness. Especially some of the lines from both the villains Khalar Zym (Stephen Lang) and his odd, finger-bladed daughter Marique (Rose McGowan). I've liked both performers in other films, and they look their part here, just some of the lines delivered aren't always shown in the best light.I've seen a share of 3D films by now and this one was somewhat distracting out of the bunch. The tight action sequences were jarring to the point of frequently throwing out my focus like no other 3D movie I've seen to date to the point of having to sit farther back than usual. For the regular, every-other-time cinema goer, I'd say ""Conan the Barbarian"" 2011 isn't worth the pricey ticket as it's not pressing to see beyond a fan of the genre or the prior source material. As for an action-fantasy movie it included a large amount of action to whiz by one's head, though for fantasy it had a fairly to the point unfolding of the story for the genre, which can make the experience more titillating than impacting.

96,Marc_Action,Blah Blah Blah,5,2 February 2012,"I never saw the original but this one is pretty mediocre. To my understanding this is a reboot and is not related to the 1982 film with Arnie. But this version is so forgettable, it hardly matters.I will say that the set and special effects are top notch. Jason Momoa is definitely a good fit for the roll as Conan. Rose McGowan is fun to watch as Marique, a naughty little witch and the daughter of Khalar Zym (Stephen Lang).Those are the good things. The huge problem that sinks this movie is it was highly predictable. I could see how the plot was going to unfold a mile away. It has all the typical clichés of a fantasy/warrior film. Young man trains with father to be a warrior, check. Nasty, evil men of authority come and burn village to the ground and attempt to wipe out villagers, check. Young warrior escapes death only to watch loved ones killed, check. Young warrior goes underground or in hiding for several years only to emerge as a young adult looking for relentless revenge, check. Some how a beautiful dame gets mixed up in the scenario, check. One by one the warrior systematically hunts down and kills all the men in the primary bad guy's entourage (because you know he has one), check. The warrior finally catches up with the primary bad guy and kills him too, but not before rescuing the beautiful young dame from the bad guy, check. Man, we've seen this storyline too many times before. I grew bored with the movie and couldn't wait for it to end. The opening scene is also very awkward. Conan's mother is pregnant with him, yet she's fighting in a battle. She gets injured and his father has to give her an amateur C-section before she dies. Then out pops Conan. It's one thing that a pregnant female is participating in a fierce battle, but then to turn around and perform a vicious C-section on the same female - very questionable judgement call.The film gets 5 stars because it's a very nice looking movie - high quality production and special effects, but doesn't get anything more because of its mediocrity.",Conan the Barbarian
97,theycallmemrglass,"Fun for a short while but gets tiresome very quickly,",5,15 August 2011,"Saw this at a preview screening in London This being a fantasy film with the most basic of plots imaginable, its fair to say that we should at least expect a menu of sex, gore and mindless fun with a film like this. To some extent, we do but there is a lack of invention to it all and I cant help feel that this is being processed by a computer program that's ticking boxes. Its a film that simply goes with the motion. Momoa's lingering ass shot, check. Bare breasts check. Magically conjured monster soldiers, check. Sword fighting (of course), check. Beautiful damsel in distress, check. Sex scene, check. Limb decapitation, check. Multiply violent elements by 10, check. Originality...oh sorry that was not on the list. Also missing from the check list were Tongue in Cheek or Sufficient Level of Humour.Jason Momoa is however, a charming lead as Conan. Perhaps more so than Schwartzenegger of the original though less iconic. Perlman makes yet another small appearance as a mentor. But as I said, originality was not on the list, so I leave you to guess his fate. Not a spoiler as this is part of the movie's synopsis.The action is pretty relentless but lacks excitement. It got very tiresome from early on, I am afraid. While Momoa valiantly carries the movie with his anti-hero charm the rest of the cast are not given much to do but to exhibit basic expressions and cheesy dialogue.Stephen Lang gets a little more to do as the main villain. I suspect the poor fellow may perhaps be forever type-casted since Avatar but he does it well.I am not sure if this film is a disappointment because I wasn't convinced by its trailer in the first place.Finally, the soundtrack was relentlessly bombastic without any subtlety or sense of identity. It was just very loud background noise.Lower your expectations, I mean really bring it down. If you like Momoa, you may enjoy this but don't look out for too much else.",Conan the Barbarian
98,wpirotte,Exactly what were you expecting?,7,10 February 2020,"9 years late, I know, but I'm watching on Amazon even though I own the DVD because, well, I am lazy. So I see a 5.2 and it reminds me of a few other anomalies the imdb crowd has exhibited, ranging from sheer silly hero worship of The Irishman to some Nutflex movies which got bad scores simply because the commies at Nutflex have now outlawed reviews onsite, which makes people feel a little teste. I mean testy.
The movie has better boobs, better acting, better special effects, and better sets than the oft quoted Arnie, of which I am a huge fan. The writing is not quite the melodrama, and the character arc is more like a character para-glide. But let's get real - these movies came from dime store novels whose appeal translated into soft core comic books. Both the paperbacks and the comics depended on the Frazetta or Frazetta-like illustrations to stimulate sales, not some kind of Joseph Conrad prose. Some of the reviews I have read were oozing with hatred, while others were way better or way worse than the score actually given. How weird is that?
It seems to me that you have to understand the genre you are working in before you can properly grade a movie. Saving Private Ryan is not Sleepless in Seattle. If you accept that premise, this movie represents raw, unwholesome entertainment, of the kind that video gamers and Americans of all ages have demanded since the days of Sam Peckinpah.",Conan the Barbarian
99,horrorules,i don't understand the hate.,7,19 February 2021,"Personally I don't understand the hatred and the fierce criticism for this film, we are not in front of a masterpiece, but I find that this new version of Conan is very good, non-stop action, a lot of violence and gore, a beautiful direction and photography (Nispel is one of the most underrated directors ever, in my opinion he's great) and the cast is good, Stephen Lang is perfect in the role of the villain and so is Rose McGowan in the role of the witch, gorgeous and talented as always Rachel Nichols. Ironically, perhaps the only one that doesn't work well is Momoa, who as an actor I find very poor and does not have a tenth of Arnold's charisma.
But aside from this small aspect, Conan The Barbarian (2011) is a valid and brutal action / fantasy.",Conan the Barbarian
100,aminjacoub,Hercules or Xena in gore incarnation,1,16 November 2011,"The original Conan movie even critically were not much accepted, become an International hit and for sure the fame starting point of an Austrian Oak - Arnold Schwarzenegger. The movie at least very well portrayed muscle charisma that Oak gives us, along with the deep yet truly villain performance of veteran James Earl Jones. Actually in original Conan we had few very well known Body Buidling stars and it stayed in memory as unique product. Original Conan reflected that fantasy real world of cruelty and near to feel of the Conan comic book. And the narration represented by Mako with his voice timbre at the start, as well at the end were perfect, with its feel of the true story of well known Comic book legend.So with this new Conan movie I had no much expectations. And the result is terrible. It can't be say much here, as I could not watch it completely how bad it was.The acting were very shallow. There were no any feel of deep emotion expressions even from those villain character who looked more comic than scary. I expected that Stephen Lang will portray it better, yet no matter how hard he tried all we had were shallow representation. Veteran Ron Perlman were OK but also shallow. The main character were only muscle packed dumb acting performer. He would be more suitable for the real ring than a movie. Actually I was shocked when I found out that Conan actor is Jason Momoa who performed Khal Drogo in HBO's Game of Thrones very well. I was shocked how bad he performed here. Other actors are not even worth to mention.The costumes looked OK, but what was especially bad, were that unrealistic gore effects, where I believe director strive to represent us how bloody was those battles or killings. I mean it was almost funny in some scenes. For example, when Conan hit one of the enemy with his sword in the upper back, almost 5 liters of blood splashed out.I think with CG they used real props, but they looked terrible. I remember two scenes (when the wall crushed and one scene with big chains). Both of them were obvious as props (or was it bad CG?) and looked like they were made of paper. And it was so obvious, same like in those low budget adventure TV series, like Hercules and Xena.The only CG I would say is OK, were those villain soldiers made from sand. It was OK. And another I must praise are Matte Painting made scenes. Those were only worth parts of the movie.This movie in complete looks the same and have the same feeling as TV shows Hercules or Xena, yet with gore elements which were to forced here. If there would not be so much graphic violence it would be maybe better, but still it is very bad movie for serious audience.For me both Hercules and Xena are better products, and more enjoyable than this trash.Stupid, predictable and boring. My vote only goes to that Matte Painting and Costumes.",Conan the Barbarian

102,Chimera-5,It's great. It's a blast. And (::drumroll::) it lives up to all expectations for those of us THAT HAD THEM!,10,18 August 2011,"*MINOR SPOILERS*You know, if you aren't familiar with a genre or a character therein, do yourself and the rest of the civilized world a favor and DON'T WATCH THESE PARTICULAR FILMS! It really isn't as complicated as splitting atoms! What film did you haters see? How about you misbegotten charlatans and frauds who are well-known ""critics"" that are just bitter you could never get a script of your own made into a feature? Because if you saw Conan, you should at least have a sprinkling of a grasp of Conan and his world and how the stories are fleshed out from the pulp novels of nearly a century ago and comic books from decades ago when fantasy and fiction COULD be told in the manner this film unravels.""The mask angle was stupid!"" ""The sorcery angle was stupid!"" ""He's mean to females!"" Yep, that's how the vibe for the stories has ALWAYS been, and Nispel clearly did his homework, but hey, feel free to complain over nonsense!This one's cute, too: ""Him and his father train with swords on ICE! What a rip-off of Batman Begins!!!"" Yeah, and I'm sure no other film in human history had two people training on ice before Batman Begins came out just a handful of years ago, right? For example, no martial arts film from any country anywhere anytime, I'm sure! Sigh, Americans, that's all I'm going to say!There's also ""It looks like a made-for-TV movie!"" No, it does not. At all. That's just a feeble attempt to try and further smear the film in much the same way the comment I mentioned in the previous paragraph is. It isn't based on anything factual and is the product of complete and utter cluelessness. People who say such unfounded foolishness are outright delusional, there's really no Option B about it.To conclude, the characters/locations/scenarios are straight out of the Conan stories of yesteryear (again, something you should have probably wrapped your head around in advance before stepping one foot in the theater), it's perfectly paced, the action is literally nonstop, the costumes and set pieces are as good as any fantasy movie not associated with Tolkien, and it looks and sounds absolutely stunning. But hey, there's a vampire film also playing so the trendy teenager in you can rejoice and there's that apes movie that was about as exciting as watching water freeze and had the most wooden, annoying, and deadbeat characters of any film this summer yet you somehow vouch for it as ""The best movie of the year!""And ultimately, let's face facts; if it were to the letter the EXACT same film but Johnny Depp played Conan or it was directed by Peter Jackson or Quentin Tarantino, you'd eat it up, possibly more than once. Because that's how shallow and biased in advance filmgoing audiences have become. Pathetic! Much like that large contingency of people who indiscriminately watch any and all things anime simply because they come from Japan, but if they were exact same thing and the country of origin was say, Zimbabwe, they wouldn't touch it with a boomerang tied to a fire hose!

103,Strider_1978,sigh,1,19 August 2011,"I saw the trailer, I like Jason Momoa, it looked like a winner. Red flag- the director. But.. in testing times it didn't hurt to go to a bloodcoaster with flashes of steel. To heck with the acting and plot I thought, just go and watch Jason slay and maim. The mothers death on the battlefield presented the first red flag, the acting is sub-standard. Watching young Conan fighting and training was good, it gave us an early insight into a well conveyed Barbarian rage and fighting prowess. After that it took a dramatic downward spiral. Jason and Steven Lang and Jasons pirate comrade hold this together, but they could not help it any more than hold together what isn't there. Even if you, like I go for the fighting you will find it uninspiring and unimaginative. It's a made-for-TV film with action scenes that fail to show epic cinematic magic. The camera pulls in tight far too often and only pulls back when cheap action thrills fail to wow or the audience is treated to painted on grandeur that look out of place given the standard prosaic canvas of the film. It's a shame, really it is because there is real potential for a franchaise here, only Jason won't go far if he continues to go under the direction of someone who should stick to music videos.

104,thesiouxfallskid,Great visuals but . . . .,3,20 July 2012,"I noticed that many did not like this film but I thought to watch it anyway and decide for myself. First the good part – the visuals were well done, CGI and all - Jason Momoa was an excellent Conan. But the story. It could have been written by a child, and that is what spoiled it for me. Illogical, clichéd, hackneyed fight scenes, gratuitous violence, Hollywoodish. It seems that a lot of work went into the visuals, settings, costumes, makeup, camera-work, but why can't they get a decent story? Are good scriptwriters that hard to find? This happens time and again in this kind of film. Fantastic artistic potential. A good writer should be able to handle it, even including magic and sorcery if that's what the producers want, and still have it appeal to a broad audience at no more than a fraction of the cost of one of the scenes. Reading the reviews here and having watched it, I think that what ruined it for many, spoiling even the visuals, was a very bad story. I also found it hard to follow and had to read the first part of the synopsis on Wikipedia. It should have been edited better so you don't have to strain yourself to catch key lines. But maybe you may like it better ignoring the actual story and scripting it yourself using your imagination. Maybe then you might enjoy it. Pieces of it anyway.",Conan the Barbarian
105,auberus,Not one redeeming value...a failure,4,5 September 2011,"I've always been a fan not only of Robert E. Howard's fantasy stories but also of the Marvel Comics or the 1982 film ""Conan the Barbarian"" with Arnold Schwarzenegger. So when I heard of a new Conan I was most interested. With today's budget and cgi they really could pull it off. Oh Man I was wrong.Where do I start as everything is wrong in this movie Words cannot adequately describe how terrible this movie is. It's that bad. However I have come to my senses to provide you with seven reasons why this film is bad.Number 1 the plot is ""shaky"". Here is the plot summary in one sentence: Conan witness the destruction of his Tribe and the Death of his Father by an evil Warlord who search the pieces of an ancient mask that is supposed to resurrect his wife, an evil sorceress that could grant him the powers of a God OK??? Obviously a Conan film isn't built on a Tarkovskian scenario but with this Conan we reach an apogee in terms of bad writing. Writers Thomas Dean Donnelly and Joshua Oppenheimer aren't fit for writing. The least they could have done was to read Robert E. Howard's literature and if as I suspect they aren't capable of reading more than 10 pages, I suggest looking at Marvel Comics who introduced a relatively lore-faithful version of Conan the Barbarian in 1970 written by Roy Thomas and illustrated by Barry Windsor-Smith. In fact the total lack of understanding the character of Conan not only from the writers but also from Director Marcus Nispel and actor Jason Momoa is the main problem. I am not a Conan fanatic but if you put the word Conan somewhere in a movie title I guess as a Director you need to understand what is the essence of a Conan movie You owe it to your audience; you owe it to yourselfNumber 2, the script is bad and as soon as Conan's Mother opens her mouth to name his son before she dies we know we are in for a treat of bad dialogs and overall silly script. What follows is ridicule one liners deliver with zero conviction from every protagonist.Number 3, where are the sidekicks? In a Conan film good sidekicks are mandatory. I remember Subotai (Jerry Lopez) in the 1982 Conan. He was a cool, loyal, and courageous dude. Every fan of this film remembers the crucifixion scene when suddenly Subotai appears in the horizon to save the day. Valeria was also a very likable and an equally strong character, some sort of Valkyrie that impacted Conan's emotions. In this 2011 version female characters are filler. The dialog of the main female character consists in screaming ""Conan"" every time she is in danger. Moreover there are no charismatic sidekicks or even interesting other characters. The black pirate serves as a pretext for a black character but has the personality of a ""playmobil""; the ""Arabic"" Thief is so common I don't even remember his name or face.Number 4, a good villain should have depth Stephen Lang as Khalar Zym does not do the job. Sure there wasn't much to do with the poor script he had in hands and screaming ""barbarian!!!"" every 2 seconds of his screen time doesn't help. Plus Rose McGowan transformed by either plastic-surgery or bad cgi (couldn't really tell) as his witchy daughter Marique is so outrageously goth that you constantly wonder if you are in a Conan film or in a remake of the Crow. Net net all protagonists are badly written and played even Ron Perlman, as Conan's father, is wasted.Number 5, there isn't any consistency between the scenesWe watch Conan's Ship being attacked during the night, but the next scene of the battle for the Ship happens during the day We see the girl go mating with Conan in a rocky cave of what seems to be a cliff environment. In the next morning when she attempts to go back to the Ship she gets kidnapped in what appears to be a Forest. At this stage I kept wondering if the Director was a little bit ""special"" or if the film editor endured a lobotomy half way during the editing session. Now that I think about it it's probably both.Number 6, they didn't hire a lead designer and that showsthey should have. Costumes, armors, or even Architecture (by the way you can clearly see the use of models) don't fit the Conan universe and there isn't any vision or unity regarding the design of the film. As a result you don't have a feel that the story takes place in a possible ancient time with tangible ancient civilizations. So basically the production recycled costumes from the last 10 sand & sandals films and the result is catastrophic.Number 7, they didn't hire a composer and that shows too. I understand that not everyone can be Basil Poledouris the composer of the haunting score from the 1982 Conan but in this 2011 Conan I was forgetting the music as I was watching the filmthis is a premiere to me.As a conclusion there is close to nothing that is enjoyable in this film. There is no sense of adventure that makes a heroic fantasy film worth it. There is no sense of progression that makes a revenge plot efficacious. There is no sense of danger that makes an action film breathtaking. There is no sense of feasibility that makes a film epic. There is no adequate script that makes characters believable and there is no musical soundtrack that draws you into the Journey. Give me 45millions dollars (half of the amount spent on this mockery) and some of the Conan fans from IMDb and we will probably do a better film",Conan the Barbarian
106,MSusimetsa,Better than I expected,6,27 August 2011,"Conan the Barbarian (2011) bears the same name as the 1982 film, but rather than being a remake, the producers aimed to go back to the roots of the character and restart the franchise. Their hopes were high when the opening weekend approached, although most Conan fans were worried about what they had seen on the trailers and many of them feared the worst. The opening weekend was rather underwhelming and some even called the movie a flop. This naturally rid me of my remaining hopes and expectations for the movie and I went to the theatre expecting the worst. Not quite Uwe Boll worst, but close.Happily, my low expectations allowed me to actually enjoy the movie and the two hours sped by faster than I could have imagined. I went in expecting little or no story and that's what was delivered. I went in knowing that the director, Nispel, has no idea how to make grand, sweeping moments in his movies and I didn't get any (who could forget the travel scenes with Poladouris' music in the 1982 movie – how I miss those). I went in knowing that the director is not a character director, so I was prepared to the overblown acting and embarrassing moments caused by lines delivered at wrong speed and with wrong timing. I knew that the script bore only passing resemblance to the Conan from Robert E. Howards stories. Lastly, I knew that the designing department had been doing their best to create the ugliest swords ever seen on the big screen.With these expectations taken care of, I was left with the mere expectation of an action adventure movie with the focus heavily laid on the action. And that's pretty much what I was treated with. The actors pulled off their parts as well as they could with the sub-par character director (there are only a handful of experienced actors who can create stunning performances without the help of director). Jason Momoa gave a nice performance of Conan and looked the part better than any other actor has before. He was the gigantic panther that Robert E. Howard described in his stories. Steven Lang overacted his part as the main bad guy, but the last minute changes to the script at least gave him some motivation for what he was doing and he seemed to have lots of fun being the bad guy. The other actors were never really given time on-screen to fully realise their characters, but they did their jobs more or less well.Overall, the two hours passed by quickly and I found that I had enjoyed the movie more than I had expected. It could have been far worse. But with a good director, better script and better music it could have been a lot better, too. If they ever do make a sequel, I hope they improve on those three aspects and do so by bringing Conan even closer to the Conan that we know from Robert E. Howards works. I want to see the reason people are willing to follow Conan. I want to see his natural leadership. I want to see the makings of a king.",Conan the Barbarian
107,info-12388,It's... uhm.... interesting...,4,13 August 2016,"It's not great by any stretch, but then again, it's not completely terrible. It just sorta... is.I wont rehash the actors or the synopsis: there are over 300 reviews that already do that for you. My biggest complaint, above all, is the storytelling. First we're here, then we're there, then we have these new people, and they all work to save these other people, and meanwhile another group of people is running around wreaking havoc, and somehow — in this vast ménage of people — Conan manages to find himself in the middle of it all every single time.Oh, and he gets laid. But in true barbarian fashion, he leaves her. She's smiling... and probably pregnant — but she's happy. Joy.The story meanders like one of the gigantic war machines featured in the film. Perhaps you had to know Howard's novel first, but it seriously felt like the writers occasionally wrote themselves into the occasional corner and then said. ""Plot twist!"" before moving on in a completely new direction. And the inconsistencies! The evil witch daughter can conjure up sand demons to fight Mr. Barbarian, but somehow she cant do the same anywhere else? Are her powers limited to just sniffing around virgins and creating people from sand? I would have thought she could do much more, but maybe she spent a good time out of class.There are a few things that save it from being a complete disaster. The production design is quite good, even though Conan's giant skirt seems a bit unwieldy for a Man o Action. The women's costumes are sexy without being tacky, and the acres of leather armour are all well sculpted. Lord knows, the CG work is amazing, if pointless.Everything falling apart in the third act seemed to have mirrored the film's production — gigantic earthquakes that strike without warning or reason and a mask whose final effect was less than fearsome, a few waving tentacles and that was about it. I was waiting for the Dead to rise again when he put it on, but instead the dead seemed just as unwilling to make an appearance in this thing as I was, after a while, to watch it.",Conan the Barbarian

This film has it all if you're seeking adventure, thrills, chills with no frills. It's purely entertaining and exactly what it should be. This film as sex appeal, heart pumping 3D action and pretty well developed characters and story line. The director gets it and he did all the right moves here. The story moves you and you're at the edge of your seat from scene one. I would say any genre fan will be into this and anyone seeking a riveting time at the movies as well. All in all a great experience, highly satisfied and plan on seeing more films by this director.",Conan the Barbarian
109,lawrenceconwayvulcan,Behold Conan,8,9 September 2017,"Jason Momoa has eked out a career in playing Alpha Males such as Khal Drogo and very soon as Aquaman. In 2011 he gave us his take on Robert E Howard's creation, a certainly more witty take than many would expect. That is not to say this one does not racks up a body count on a quest of revenge against those whose who wiped out his village. Director Marcus Nispel keeps the film to a brisk pace with a succession of fast moving action set pieces. Stephen Lang makes for a hissable bad guy while Rose McGowan plays his creepy daughter who are on a quest to bring their witch wife/mother back from the dead. Rachel Nichols plays a character who might have been played as the typical damsel in distress if were not for the fact that she can handle herself in a fight. 2011's Conan the Barbarian may not be high art but it is more than entertaining.",Conan the Barbarian
110,Vezon123,Epic Fail!,5,21 August 2011,"A lot of this movie is mailed in on all fronts, but he production/ writing and or directing end of it kills it at times. At times Jason Momoa is absolutely 100% Conan more so than Arnold, but then they give him scenes where he comes off as a juiced up Vincent Chase (Entourage) lost in time. I enjoyed it, but I've invested too much time with Conan in my life to give this a seal of approval. I would like to see the series continued with Momoa, but with a different director and storyline drawn from either REH's work or at least from the Savage Sword. There are great scenes amid some other ones. The opening was a major letdown, and I couldn't wait for Conan to grow up. Once he did, some fight scenes were fantastic, especially with the sand people. Still worth checking out, especially if you're going in with low expectations.",Conan the Barbarian
111,Freemheart,Beyond Revenge - What the brainless critics omits,9,10 November 2011,"Twenty year ago, just to read something, I bought my first comic of The Savage Sword of Conan, after that, I watched the John Milius film and specially the books of Robert E. Howard and many more comics. I been reading many reviews and almost all the critics seems to know nothing about Conan except the movie with Schwarzenegger, a very good movie but...Even when the new Conan The Barbarian has his flaws, a story with a few things in commons with ""The lord of the rings"", not so much reference to the countries and races of the Hyborian age, and a not so wonderful soundtrack like the Basil Poledouris's masterpiece. If you compare Jason Momoa with the descriptions of Robert E. Howard, the comics, he is perfect as Conan in every scene: he is rude but not so stupid as seems to be in the Milius film, he is full of anger but knows how to use it and knows how to show other emotions, even his dialog is good. Conan, Khalar Zym, Marique, Tamara almost every character show his own story not as pure good or pure evil, every one has an important part.It began like a bad ""pastiche"" of JRR Tolkien and after a few minutes became a true Conan movie, with a lot of action, great sword battles, lot of blood (everyone who had read the tales of Conan knows is impossible tells his story without blood sequences) but a wonderful story not only about revenge, but also the sons and daughters thirst to keep the legacy of their parentsI love the John Milius I have seen that film more than 30 times, but I have to admit, this new adaptation (not remake) is far faithful to the work of Robert E. Howard in every single thing.",Conan the Barbarian
112,meelaleks,I prefer the decent original b-movie over this one,3,12 January 2019,"Back in 1982 I watched the original in a cinema. It made me laugh (mainly because I found it to be a b-movie) and found it sort sort of passible. For some season they revisited the story. Ah well, what could go wrong? Errr... a lot. Especially since they spend way more money this time. Music score, dialogues.... below par. Worse: it lacks the fantasy genre feeling of the original, depth and why overdo the action scenes and gore? I also fail to understand why they choose the comforting voice of Freeman, totally out of place here? I managed to avoid skipping parts or running half the movie on tripple speed (yes, I watched it at home) but honestly, I was happy it ended. Once again I learned that I value a decent b-movie over a bad a-movie.",Conan the Barbarian
113,richy1024,Conan the Barbaric and awful!,2,7 October 2012,"Every time the Barbarian, Conan is mentioned most would relate their experience's to the Arnold Schwarzenegger 1982 original. Regrettably, Marcus Nispel's efforts fail to add any clarity to the remake. The pitch of the movie is dull and not even appearances of Rachel Nichols and Rose McGowan fragrance much stimulation this time around. If you're a visceral buddy then this one's for the collection but regrettably you are not required to be packaged with much intellect with Nispel's exertion here.This addition ponders around with repetitive and many comparable dog fights between Conan and his foes. If this was a computer game we would have experienced more stimulation but this stab fails to qualify as its monotony becomes a little wearisome after a short stint of the action. Furthermore, the dialogue pitches within the wrong time period, seeming too modern for the ancient walls it strives to sell itself within. And Momoa's ten or so words seem to resonate discomforting grunting more so then any language known to man.Jason Momoa is a fine choice to emulate the visual quality of a barbarian character, apart from the lack of poetry in his speech. He is bold, fearless and comprehends with the term barbaric to a stance. His visceral approach fits impeccably with the tone of the film. Following Arnold Schwarzenegger was more than a pumped bicep in itself, although the former governor was perhaps about as good at acting as sitting behind Californian counters. Stephen Lang delivers another average performance, gluing himself to the villainess nuisance role, which is obviously safe to say the least, as seen as Colonel Quaritch in Avatar.Conceivably the most impressive, and only imposing feature are McGowan's ingenious earth bursting and exploding digital sandmen who she convenes to battle Conan. That is all I'm afraid.",Conan the Barbarian
114,johntk1566,Exactly what it set out to be,8,15 April 2019,"I gave this an 8, not because it is an amazing film but because it does exactly what it set out to. If you want a great swords and sandals film, watch this. If you have moderate to zero interest in the genre, avoid this because you'll hate it.This is just as good as the original films and serves the source material just fine.The effects are great and the acting is no more than it needs to be. Great visuals and costume designs fit the setting perfectly.",Conan the Barbarian
115,jdavisjdavis,I want a sequel with same actors; new writers/director?,7,20 August 2011,"Mamoa was very charismatic and convincing as Conan, A+ there. To be honest, much better than Arnold at portraying the character from the books. Hey, I loved Arnold as Conan... but Mamoa feels like the real deal. Actually the actors all around were pretty good. Ron Perlman, always great. Rose McGowan was surprisingly good at being creepy, but I would prefer her with eyebrows and more hair.The look of the film was very well done. Great sets, costumes, etc. Good use of an R rating... besides some violence, guys will get some other good things to look at. I won't complain. CGI was good, and I'm the first one to complain if it isn't well done. My only complaints were Rose and the guys with the weird teeth were just not done to my liking visually... just a personal preference.Writing and directing? The first 1/4 of the movie actually played out really well. The kid doing the young Conan was impressive! Ron Perlman... the man is just good. Sadly, after that the story got very muddled- it simply was not the best. Not enough flow, cohesion, emotional involvement, or character development after that first 1/4.Because of the botched storytelling, the whole thing just wasn't as good as the original Arnold Conan. Though it was better than Arnold's second Conan movie (even though I loved that one as a kid, too).So, yeah. Certainly worth a watch if you like Conan... but should have been great instead of above average overall. I really want a sequel with a serious directory/writer at the head... that will be something.",Conan the Barbarian

117,Happy_Evil_Dude,"""I live. I love. I slay. And I am content.""",7,17 August 2011,"Let me preface this review by stating that I have not seen either of the Arnold Schwarzenegger films (except for the opening scene of the first one during a class), not a single episode of any of the TV shows, whether animated or live-action and have never read any of the original stories by Robert E. Howard nor any subsequent comic book and have never played any of the video games. As such, I have no means to compare it to the previous films or to assess its fidelity to Howard's works. I am coming in fresh, and reviewing this film strictly on its own merits using as prejudice only my image brought over by pop culture of who Conan The Barbarian is.The basic story is this: as a Morgan Freeman sound-alike tells us, a long time ago there were these bad guys, the Acheron, who had this bone mask which made them really powerful, but the Barbarian tribes united and beat them to a pulp and they destroyed the mask with each tribe keeping a piece of the mask so that it can't be united again. Then came the ""Hyborian Age"" and baby Conan is born on a battlefield to the chief of a Cimmerian village and a mother who dies in the process. Years later, teenage Conan is a skillful fighter and the village is attacked by a guy who wants to reunite the mask pieces. He finds the last piece remaining with the help of his witch daughter and Conan is forced to watch his father die in front of him. Naturally, he vows revenge and years later, adult Conan still searches for his father's murderers.I will just come straight out and say I very much enjoyed this version of Conan The Barbarian. No, it's not an Oscar contender, of course not. No, there are no big surprises either, the whole thing is pretty straightforward. But it fulfilled every expectation I had from a movie called ""Conan The Barbarian"". Much like the other recent Robert E. Howard adaptation from the same producers, 2009's Solomon Kane, and perhaps even more so, it's a perfectly sound, effective piece of entertainment, and compared to other films with similar ambitions, such as Prince Of Persia: The Sands Of Time, The Scorpion King and the Clash Of The Titans remake, it is much better.First of all, the film looks very good. The world we are shown is vast and expansive. Indeed, Conan moves around a lot and we are introduced to scores of different environments, all beautifully conceived from amalgamations of different real-world cultures and with a realistic look and feel. Secondly, the film is not shy on violence and certainly earns its R rating. The (very) numerous action scenes range from very good to excellent and are in addition very bloody. In fact I'd go so far as to claim that the film is more bloody than director Marcus Nispel's remakes of The Texas Chainsaw Massacre and Friday The 13th combined. In other words, you may not want to bring your kids and the squeamish may want to give this a pass, as there are some truly unpleasant scenes.Tyler Bates' score is not particularly memorable after a first watch but is still strong, epic, and effective. Marcus Nispel has truly done a great job directing the film, and a strong sense of adventure seeps through every frame. He also seems to pay homage to John Milius in an early scene where Conan and his father forge a sword together, which echoes and looks very similar to the opening scene of the 1982 film. The 3D (post-converted) looks good and works well in the film.As for the actors, Jason Momoa, best known as a TV actor up to this point with roles in Baywatch, North Shore, Stargate Atlantis and Game Of Thrones, does not possess the same presence as Arnold Schwarzenegger but delivers an adequate performance nonetheless. Teen Conan, played by the same kid who blew everyone away as Teen Snake Eyes in G.I. Joe: The Rise Of Cobra is very good here as well. Ron Perlman (Hellboy, Season Of The Witch) acts as his bearded father and does well as expected, and otherwise we have Stephen Lang (Avatar) as the bad guy, Rose McGowan (TV's Charmed and who was ironically previously attached to a Red Sonja reboot) as his daughter, Rachel Nichols (G.I. Joe) as the love interest and Saïd Taghmaoui (G.I. Joe) as one of Conan's buddies (3 former G.I. Joe actors in a single movie?). There's also that huge pile of muscles called Nathan Jones whom you might remember from the beginning of Troy. All do fine and apart from Perlman and Taghmaoui are rather unrecognizable.The biggest question is how will 2011's movie audiences react to Conan The Barbarian, as it seems in many ways a relic of a bygone era. It's a very earnest film, that doesn't pretend to be anything else than what it is, where characters snarl at each other and raise their swords to the sky in a powerful thrust while screaming their lungs out while heroic music plays on the soundtrack. Yet somehow, for some reason modern audiences seem to think they're above this sort of thing and tend to snicker at such things. They might call it unsophisticated and silly. But I am rooting for Conan The Barbarian. I hope that people will be able to appreciate it for what it is instead of mocking it for those same reasons. I hope it is successful enough to green-light the planned Red Sonja film starring Amber Heard as well as Conan sequels. I would like to see this become a franchise.In short the film looks great, is decently acted, has a Morgan Freeman sound-alike narrating, offers plenty of imaginative action scenes and is just altogether entertaining, which is the most important thing. A job well done.",Conan the Barbarian
118,fmbr-1,Not eye-bleedingly bad. But will never be a winner.,5,18 January 2017,"There is one big problem with this film - its title. If this was called Kilgoth the Swordsman, it would have done a lot better. But as Conan, everyone is going to compare it to the 1982 movie - even worse, its going to be compared with the 1982 movie viewed with eyes of nostalgia. Momoa is certainly a talkier Conan than Swartzenegger ever was. His acting, like the acting of all, isn't actually all that bad; and, nostalgia be damned, I think Momoa was better than Swatzenegger was in 82. Everyone was let down by the script though which should have been a lot better. Thomas Dean Donnelly and Joshua Oppenheimer (the writers) are just not that good and even good actors can't make a silk purse out of a sow's ear. Another problem is the number of henchmen that Khalar Zym has. Including his daughter, there has to be about eight of them that all have to get their screen time looking badass and then get killed by Conan. I understand that young actors need to get experience but this just seems like a production line. Finally, there is the plot - thanks again Donnelly and Oppenheimer. As far as I can piece it together, Khalar Zym's wife was a powerful sorceress but before she could rule the world with her husband and turn him into a god, she was captured and burned at the stake while he watched. He then heard the rumours of this mask that brings back the dead, the pieces being held by the various barbarian tribes that killed the guy that last used it - so Zym goes on a big quest beating up and then recruiting barbarians (don't know how that works) to get the mask back. The last piece is in Conan's village and Conan's dad, decides not to join so dies but saves his some. Meanwhile Zym, spends 20 years looking for the pure blood of someone, which naturally enough turns out to belong to a hot girl; while Conan levels up and spends the same time looking for Zym. Strange that they both find each other at the same time and Conan ends up with the girl, so Zym has to come to him. Despite all this, it is sort of entertaining with the large number of action sequences one expects from this sort of film. It's fun for an evening where you have nothing to do and don't want something deep.",Conan the Barbarian
119,Navaros,Conan 2011: an easily-routed pretender to the thrones of Milius and Schwarzenegger!,1,7 September 2011,"Conan 2011 is a pathetic remake which attempts to ride the coattails of and cash in on the classic John Milius MASTERPIECE, Conan the Barbarian from 1982.Conan 2011 plagiarizes the title, font, and basic plot of Conan 1982: the people of Conan's village, and Conan's father and mother, are slain by an evil warlord while Conan is a child; Conan then grows up and his one goal in life is to avenge the murders by killing said warlord.Plagiarism is always evil, but *at least* they are plagiarizing a masterpiece. As plagiarism goes, they could do worse. But then they do! Unfortunately, Conan 2011 soon stops plagiarizing *just* Conan 1982, and also plagiarizes, badly, a plethora of other films, such as Onibaba, Pirates of the Caribbean, The Matrix, Prince of Persia, Star Wars, etc.Momoa should go back to surfing and luaus, and leave filmic barbarianism to appropriate actors. As Conan, Momoa is a horrid replacement for the legendary Arnold Schwarzenegger. Schwarzenegger is - as a true barbarian must be - a gigantic juggernaut. In contrast, Momoa is a puny weakling. Momoa might be bigger than the average guy who hangs around the beach surfing and sun tanning all day long, but that is *not* our standard. When placed in the category of BARBARIAN, Crom and mortals alike do and must put to flight out of the realm the runt Momoa, with our laughter! Some hardcore Howard (the author of Conan books) fans make the ludicrous claim that Momoa is better as Conan than Schwarzenegger, simply because Momoa is 'faster' than Schwarzenegger. It's easy to be fast when you are a puny like Momoa is, and when you are carrying fake plastic swords, like Momoa does in Conan 2011. Schwarzenegger carries real eight-pound steel swords in Conan 1982. Howard does say that Conan is 'agile.' However, Howard also says that Conan is a giant. One cannot, in real-life, be *both* agile *and* a giant - Howard created a paradox of a fictional person. Any actor is a real person, and can therefore only be one or the other. Of the two traits, for a Barbarian, giant is far more important and impressive. Those with knowledge of the Riddle of Steel do surely know that a giant juggernaut with an eight-pound real steel sword will never fail to crush a puny weakling with a half-pound fake plastic sword.Schwarzenegger dominates the screen. His inherent visual appeal, charm and charisma establish between himself and the viewer an empathetic relationship with and vested interest in the Conan character.Momoa is the exact opposite in all of those regards. Momoa has zero screen presence, visual appeal, charm or charisma. Whereas Schwarzenegger inspires thrills and cheers, Momoa inspires boredom and indifference.Unquestionably, Schwarzenegger with his might has ousted the failed usurper and pretender to his Conan throne, Momoa.Conan 1982's majestic score by Basil Poledouris is universally recognized as one of the best film scores of all-time. Suffice to say, it is a masterpiece of unmatched greatness. Conan 2011's score is so poor that to even call it a score is to give it far more dignity than it deserves. Cheesy, familiar, and generic pseudo-musical cues is a more accurate description for the abomination that masquerades as a score for Conan 2011.Milius fills Conan 1982 with grand, masterful shots of sweeping natural landscapes and mountains. These shots give Conan 1982 the feel of a timeless fantasy epic. For Conan 1982's action, Milius relies on simple yet raw shots which expertly represent the brutality of the world, and which always clearly show the viewer the action.Nispel fills Conan 2011 with incompetent shots that make the action impossible to see, and which give Conan 2011 a claustrophobic feel, as well as the feel of a rushed, amateur hack job by a sub-par first year filmmaking student. For example, such shots comprise the sequence of young Conan fighting off some unintentionally comedic caricatures who are intended to be savage warriors. Nispel's incompetent camera placement (he places the camera close to Conan when it should be far, and vice versa) ensures that the viewer cannot properly see the action.The action in Conan 2011 is asinine. Conan, as a child, slays four adult savages. Despite being savages, the four of them all conveniently wait their turns to be slain in a one-on-one fight with Conan, rather than attacking him four-on-one, from all sides, as would real savages. After being stabbed in the leg, one savage stands idle and lets Conan take his weapon so that Conan can continue to slay him and his companions.To take out one of the savages, Conan uses a Jet Li-style flying jump kick to the face. Where did Conan learn this? Is that a standard barbarian technique from ancient times? Is the viewer really supposed to believe that a kid kicking a man in the face once would knock the man out? YES, says Nispel. This is a joke, which Nispel does not *intend* as a joke. He intends the viewer to accept that this nonsense is realistic and believable.As a parody, the fight scenes in Conan 2011 would be the work of genius. But since they are not intended to be parody, they are instead the work of utter failure.The dialogue of Conan 1982 is brilliant, delving into deep thematic concerns such as whether steel is more powerful than flesh, and similarities between avenging hero and the villain who shaped him, etc. I do not have enough space to expound on the richness of Conan 1982's dialogue versus the total banality of Conan 2011's dialogue, but any viewer of both will surely understand the point.Do yourself a favor: laugh at Conan 2011 as you banish it from your memory, and savor the immense enjoyment you will receive as you load up and watch tonight Conan 1982.",Conan the Barbarian
120,Shakor77,"Tripe, utter tripe",2,29 August 2011,"I can't say that I am a Conan fan but I watched and enjoyed the original movie (and the terrible sequel) and I have read a lot of Conan comics and some books and I like them all, the Arnold original movie the most.So it was with great excitement that I waited to see this movie as it seemed to have an impressive line of actors but how I was disappointed.Without getting into much details I can just say that this movie makes zero sense and it seems to have been put together to sell only for the name and gore because it has little else.The original movie on the other hand made a lot of sense. Boy see his parents killed, his mother beheaded and his village destroyed. He was sent to die a slave but his burning feeling of vengeance kept him alive and made him strong and as a gladiator, trained by the best, and then later mercenary he became the mighty Conan.But the movie also showed that he is not strong so to stand alone so he gets help both from lovers and friends as they help him get his vengeance. An awesome movie which was made even better with Arnolds body builder muscles, embodying the ""invincibility"" of Conan.This movie on the other hand explains very little. Why is Conan this feared warrior? He was born (literally) on the battle field but how does that make him a great swordsman? Where did he get the skills, even as as a young boy, to kill adults? What is the secret of steel which the original movie answered but here is left un-answered.None of this is explained but rather the movie seems to assume that Conan is what he is because he is well... Conan. Stupid. Which is what this movie is.",Conan the Barbarian
121,nvjs,"Nispel CAN'T do Action, the least difficult genre!",1,9 July 2012,"I thought Pathfinder was mediocre at best, and considering it was Nispel's first attempt at the action genre, that his skills at the least difficult genre had nowhere to go but get better. Nah uh! Not here. He just can't do the genre or this venerable cult film any justice. There was little homage to the original. The narrative and story weren't engaging. The reason I say that is because Ahnuld, Milius, and Stone actually delivered a rags-to-riches story that Stone had previously done. You may have heard about it.It starred Pacino, Pfeiffer, Loggia and Bauer. Scarface. Nispel didn't give Lang much if any weight as a villain that Jones did with his silent charisma that was eerie in his silent moments. You don't have much empathy for the new Conan since he only does rage and cockiness. There isn't much for Ron Perlman to do either, since he's just wasted as a village elder and Conan's father.Nispel doesn't invest anytime with character development so you don't have an emotional investment to care about any of the characters. Even though the village was alive for a brief moment, you felt Conan's sudden loss and desolation. He grew through the course of a movie to be come a reaver, bandit, warrior as Robert E.Howard wrote him.But here, Nispel just decided to fore go the saga and just went (yawn) with your popcorn flick that ran under 120 minutes. Never do you feel that Conan was against the wall, outnumbered or even threatened. Actually, I felt more sympathy for Lang's hammy villain since he actually made an endearing effort to do the cliché'd villain's ultimate goal.Conan came off as a high school football jock against the brainiest nerd's fellow minded legion. Rotten through and through. I don't understand why Nispel can't pull off the actioneer ? This is where most aspiring film-makers start. So if you're reading this Marcus Nispel, You seem to do horror remakes... ""well"", why deviate ? You don't win Oscars doing this crap.",Conan the Barbarian
122,FrostyChud,No imagination,4,17 August 2011,"SPOILERS FOR BOTH CONAN MOVIES FOLLOWThe first Conan is one of my favorite movies of all time. The Destroyer sucks although I did like it when I was a kid. The new one sucks too. There are too many battle scenes and they are all dull. There is absolutely nothing new here. What made the first movie so great was the poetry of it all. The land felt barren. Conan was not another cookie cooker hero on a cookie cutter George Lucas hero quest but a true nomad...a man who wanders from one encounter to the next...a witch...a snake cult...getting drunk and laid...punching a camel...happening upon the man who murdered his father...killing him...the epistemological space in which the first Conan takes place is that of a senseless premodern universe in which magical events succeed each other without ever truly fusing into one overarching narrative. Meaning is always somewhere over the horizon and the gods never deign to show themselves. The movie is filmed, scripted and scored in such a way that we feel the radical foreignness of Conan's universe. In the new film, however, there is no alterity at all, no imagination, no sense of being transported, no attempt to depart from the vaguely ideological boilerplate superhero narrative in even the slightest way...no mythical resonance...the new Conan struts and smirks like something out of the Fast and the Furious and has none of the cruel charisma of Arnold Schwarzenegger. Although the movie is incredibly violent and gory, the pat coziness of the narrative renders all of this violence absolutely sterile. Nothing real is ever at stake and the movie has nothing to say about anything. It practically evaporates off the screen it is so ephemeral. Don't waste your time with this one...watch the first one again.By the way, I am not one of those people who dislikes remakes and ""reboots"" on principle...I actually really enjoyed Marcus Nispel's reboot of Friday the 13th...but he's out of his depth here.",Conan the Barbarian
123,buddybhupender,all muscle but not story,2,30 August 2011,"WELL I was very excited about the movie when i entered in the theater but it faded away after the 20 minutes duration.. i was hoping that this Conan movie seems different not simply because of involvement of 3D or CGI effects but a lot has been changed in the way movie making works these days. the trailers were nice so everyone was hoping the story is there this time unlike previous installments where only muscles were the center of the story. Hero displays his biceps and holding sword in his both hands..cut, next scene a lovemaking scene...cut... climax..the end.no wonder why the first two movies never impressed me that they were a genuine effort. they were only made to cash the popularity of Arnold. Well they succeeded but at that time audience were not kept aware of the storyline or screening so that they have a clue of what they are going to see.. they bought ticket just for the sake of star cast.But current scenario has changed..if the story is good even without an unknown star cast movies works..This Remake of Conan fails on several levels.. 1. STORY 2. ACTING 3. REPRESENTING SOMETHING WHICH HAS BEEN DONE BETTER WITHOUT THE MODERN TECHNOLOGY IN THE PAST.I notices many scenes in the 3D version were not getting the feel of 3D. they looked more like 2D quality. I WAS WATCHING many scenes without using my glasses & faced no difficulty at all..I don't know what was in the mind of director during the post production work.the story was same as the Bollywood directors calls a ""MASALA SCRIPT""... i.e. hero is in childhood, his father is on the opposition of villain so villain kills the father of hero to clear his path.. hero runs away or hides himself so that one day he grows up and avenge the death of his family. In India many movies were made on the same theme & they somehow managed to attract the crowd. but this formula has been repeated so many times that even in India people don't go for these films & no wonder filmmakers don't make these kinda films.But Hollywood audience is way more smarter than this. So how the directors of this movie dared to present this script. where no creativity is present. Because script didn't brought anything new so there was not plenty to do for actors so poor performance in acting. Graphics were good but it cannot holds your interest for the whole 90 minutes or so. My friend was also with me and he doesn't watch many Hollywood movies but even he said that this movie was a crap & waste of money. and i was fully agree with him. I felt that a huge fan base was conned by the filmmakers.A huge disappointment..!!! 2/10 is my rating.",Conan the Barbarian

I Slay, and I'm contempt"" I'll still use this with the ladies.",6,19 May 2012,"What makes me rate this movie 6 is mostly it's soundtrack. It was nice enough to made me watch the end credits. No kidding. Too bad mostly writing sucks and Morgan Freeman didn't help as much as he was paid off to.Conan personality haven't called my attention too. He's an warrior since a kid (perhaps too much as a warrior, as you'll/did see. He's loyal and brave and he sories for party rockin, but I've seen this to many times it looses its emotion.All the colors (or the lack of them) produced a cool Dragon Age II atmosphere, only without the all the magic and armors. And visual effects were amazingly done. Magic here ain't exaggerated, but I don't remember if there's magic in the first 82's Conan movie.If the soundtrack is so amazing, sometimes Sound Effects were too abused, just like Eyes opening with sword slashing noise. And this is just ONE example. If you watch it paying more attention you'll find more. Like the Khalar Zym crew who growls like monsters.The plot itself is pretty much basic, and thank God the ""pure blood girl"" wasn't ""the untouchable by man girl"".The acting is more or less like Immortals and Clash Of the Titans. Sometimes they tried to make it funny, but it can't, and producers should stop trying to make an warrior like a boss film with humor.It's a so so movie and except for it's original frakking amazing soundtrack, can't see much to talk about it.And with that said, I'm done.

126,dbryn,What A Disgrace,1,3 January 2013,"I had heard some bad reviews of this movie, but still wanted to see it. For me I really liked the intro with young Conan; however, the story was weak, there were frequent moments of cheese, no character development at all! I'm curious as to how the writers managed to sell such an expensive movie? Aside from the terrible plot, here's what bothers me (SPOILER WARNING!): In the first few minutes Conan's mom is about to give birth after being critically wounded. She convinces her husband to slit her open so she can meet her son. The father plunges his dagger inside her, without looking, and immediately pulls out young Conan. Apparently, all the bad guys recognized that mother and father had a 'timeout' as the battle rages on around them. Kudos for dad to perform surgery so quickly... CHEESE!!!!! The handling of the swords in general. I happen to have a real samurai sword and it's quite heavy to hold parallel to the floor and I'm 6'3 and 200lbs. The samurai sword would be incredibly light compared to Conan's broad sword, who the evil daughter (5'3"", maybe 120lbs) holds by the edge of the hilt with her fingers, handing the sword to her father. I highly doubt she could actually lift the sword in one hand, let alone keep it balanced by the hilt while passing it to her father as she reached. The swords were, in general, apparently weightless throughout the production and could slice through thick heavy chain... yet when the sand golem/men hacked at Conan numerous times, landing blows, Conan didn't have a mark on him.Speaking of the sand golems/men. They rise up from the sand, they do some pretty wicked tumbling, appearing from and reappearing from the sand. I thought this was one of the best ideas in the movie... until two of them were killed by falling one story off of a scaffold... into the sand? All of a sudden they are affected by gravity and the hard sand, from which they were born? Way to ruin a cool idea.The 'chosen one' is a girl from some convent. She seems pretty pure and innocent, yet within a few minutes of meeting Conan, she is barking orders on whether or not to kill a man or not. OK, so she's a rebel ""chosen one'? Hmm, a few scenes later she is fully capable of kicking ass, stabbing and killing a handful of soldiers from the dark army horde. Fast forward an hour, and she's a helpless victim who won't shut up from screaming through the last half hour of the movie.Lack of creativity... let's see, let's give the daughter witch some claws JUST like Wolverine. Let's use an underwater serpent that rises up JUST like in Star Wars. On that note, Conan and the thief - who was acquired to help break into the palace... yet conveniently seemed to have a set of keys for everything? - are walking through a sewer at waste level. As soon as they are attacked by said water serpent and pulled under, they are instantly in about 15ft or more of water? What happened to the floor? Why is it he needed a thief again? It appeared as though the entire purpose of the thief was to be dragged around by the serpent.Probably the biggest blunder of the movie was the villain. The villain wants to complete his mask in order to summon his dead wife, who happens to be a bad ass necromancer? OK, if you're a bad guy... this is a major goal? The villain let's Conan live as a boy. He defeats Conan and then just pushes him around while shouting insults at him at the half-way point. At the end, he also defeats Conan and toys with him for a few minutes before Conan is able to reverse his fortune and kick the guys ass. In short, right from the get-go, we figure Conan is never in any real danger and the goal may not be as important as we initially think. Why wouldn't the villain just kill Conan and get on with it? Instead, he just toys with Conan...So, in summary... the movie sucked! It pains me that 5 really good movies could have been produced on this budget. Instead, we had to sit through this dreadful movie and terrible writing!",Conan the Barbarian
127,derektrotteresq,So bad it hurts!,2,22 September 2013,"I haven't seen the original so I had no expectations when I watched this movie. The movie stinks, it stinks worse than an indoor fish market, if all of the proprietors were gunned down and the fish in said market were left out for a week with the heating on.

This movie offers You ""A grade"" quality of picture, ""A- grade"" quality of camera angles ""B grade"" quality of story composition ""B grade"" quality of actor performance and ""A- grade"" of sound/music quality. It's not that bad as a movie for DVD/BD @ your home, right?

As I say, these guys didn't put out any blockbuster performance to Your screen but seriously, it wasn't that bad [5/10] all in all.

129,madpigmadpig,"Not Really a Conan Movie, Not Worth Watching Either",2,30 May 2014,"Although this movie is essentially a moderately tweaked remake of the basic story from 80s version, the plot is actually fairly different. Some of the fight sequences in the movie were relatively interesting, but overall this movie exhibited very poor writing, acting, casting, and surprisingly even mise en scène. First let's get the most obvious, and possibly the least important, complaint out of the way. Conan is so thoroughly described in the books as a proto-Celtic guy with jet-black hair, cobalt-blue eyes, and many battle scars, that is stronger (and almost always, but not necessarily always, taller) than any other man he meets. Momoa is a Hawaiian guy with brown hair and brown eyes who (despite a height of 6'4"") appears to be shorter and much weaker than several of the other characters in the movie. Secondly, the primary things that make Conan a great barbarian character is his utter lack of angst and philosophical complexity, his strategic mind for infiltration in battle, and his quickness to act. Conversely, the Conan in this movie spends the entire film metaphorically rending garments, takes something like 20 years to exact revenge, and virtually stumbles through the entire story without any sense of forethought. I'm not really bothered by all the naked people (okay, naked women) in the film, as people were generally not that concerned with wearing clothing during the (albeit fictional) time period represented in the film, but I would argue that spending so much time on the long, extremely boring uber-pornographic sex scene was totally unnecessary and added nothing worthwhile to the movie. Finally, the villain proclaimed that barbarians like Conan don't pray or have any kind of religion. To that, I say ""Oh, Please!"" Conan had his butt saved deux ex machina style several times by his god, and prayed at least once that I read of. I have other complaints as well, but I'm going to stop here so it doesn't get overlong.I'd recommend the movie for Anyone having trouble with figuring out how not to make a good action movie, and skeezy guys who are afraid to be seen renting 'official' porno.Content notes: Most, but not all, of the swearing is replaced by Conanisms like (by Crom!). However, a few regular swear words illogically pop up sometimes too. It's mostly not really that gross of a movie either, except for some extremely grotty stuff at the beginning, like the C-section. It is pretty violent though.To save you from having to actually suffer through this tripe, movie is basically this: After suffering a wound in battle, Conan's mom gets an impromptu Caesarian section with a sword and dies. Years later, when Conan is an adolescent, his father commits suicide in order to prevent Conan from brainlessly dying in an attempt to save him from a trap set up by a crazy warlord. Instead of immediately hunting down and killing the warlord, like the literary version of the character probably would have, Conan spends his adult life angstily searching the earth for the warlord while occasionally running into large groups of slutty, naked slave girls until finally tracking him down, initially getting bi#$%-slapped in a fight with him, and finally defeating him while acquiring a snarky girlfriend in the process.",Conan the Barbarian
130,ttaskmaster,Hollywood fails yet again...,3,11 January 2012,"I've always been a big fan of the John Millius and Arnold films, so I was both afraid of seeing what newfangled nonsense had done to the story, yet eager to see what people were claiming was even better... Even my favourite reviewer, Catherine Reitman, gave it some favourable comments... just some, though. The first act of the movie was cool. Heavily over-gory, but appropriately so and without being oversensational about it (ie, like 300). The storyline is rich and the environment bursting with detail. True, the plot is somewhat OTT, but this is a tale of high adventure. Given the legend, I can well believe a kid like Conan achieving what he does. For me, a character's appearance is usually representative of the whole film's cinematography and style. Conan is tall and panther-like, never Arnie's bricks-in-a-pillow muscley look. Jason Momoa has that down well, along with the dark hair and some vague semblance of Oriental/Eastern Steppes sort of look.... But he still has too much Hawaiian to be fully convincing, for me. He is also a touch too boyish and pretty for my eyes and the stereotypical plastered-on scar (down through the eyeline, but subtle enough not to spoil his beauty) only adds to the cartoony Xena feel. I always saw Xena as being about barbarians who shower and exfoliate every day, with at least one stylist on hand, spray-on sweat and grime applied Mary Poppins style (from a make-up compact). In short, he is NOT Conan... he is The Scorpion King all over again, but without even the snappy dialogue. And he looks like he learned to act solely by copying three expressions from Karl Urban. Conan films should be dark, dirty, bloody, filthy and have almost NO characters that we would consider 'Hollywood beautiful', unless they are princesses or gods (Sandahl Bergman as a Valkyrie :) ). But regardless, the first half of the film is good - Slightly cheesy plot and nothing that's not been thought of before, but convincing enough that you go with it and executed with enough unique moments to be thoroughly entertaining. Then, all of a sudden, everything falls flat... The sets start getting over-detailed and like they're only there to look visually impressive to a 3-D audience. Conversely, the acting got worse and all the characters magically became one-dimensional. It's like the filmmakers just got bored and did 'whatever' just to finish the project and collect a paycheque. We meet the female co-star - She's gorgeous, pretty, shiny and a former model... totally unsuited to a Conan flick. The plot gets lazy and starts sounding like a generic, cheap fantasy film. The swordplay gets all spinny and everyone suddenly starts fighting like Eastern martial artists. The stunts get all Jackie Chan and the only thing missing is heavy wire-work with people flying around. As a swordsman myself, the moves in the original Conan are flawed and over-staged but still work and are realistic enough to entertain. The stuff in this new film is just pure show and no-one after the first third of the film ever looks like they have even picked up a sword before. There was only one move in the whole film that grabbed my attention. 2 mere seconds of footage throughout the whole thing!Chuck in a random big sea monster to complete the circle and you have your massive Hollywood crowd-pleaser... even though I've been more entertained by a $2000 B-Movie. I was not a fan of the casting either, for the most part. Ron Perlman does a fantastic job of Conan's father... Not quite as legendary or with as epic a feel as William Smith, but he is easily the best actor in the cast. He has real presence, proper depth and, as with his lower budget films, is the only reason this film is worth watching. Jason Momoa may have a good look, but he's too pretty and not once did I get the impression that his Conan was a deep thinker, or in any way the wise, quietly contemplative man I know him to be. He's just a mindless, violent thug with pretty looks and a bit of muscle. He even looked like his entire acting repertoire consists solely of 3 facial expressions stolen from Karl Urban. He is eye candy with a sword, but nothing more. For all his faults, Arnold actually brought his Conan to life. Momoa's portrayal will be quickly forgotten. Samuel L Jackson??!! Why is he even here? He has what I call Morgan Freeman syndrome, since Morgan also crops up in a lot of similar roles. Yes, he has a good narrative voice, but there is no mystical quality and he doesn't even sound like a chronicler... He just sounds like Samuel L Jackson, sat down the pub, telling us about a film he watched the other day. He might as well have just said, ""Back in 5000BC, the following happened:"". Stephen Lang... OK, he was a decent bad guy in Avatar... But now Hollywood are casting him in all their bad guy roles and the same trick does not work everywhere. There was almost no difference in his performance between here and Avatar. In fact, he wasn't even scary in this. Absolutely no presence at all. That's why James Earl Jones is still The Man!The rest of the cast, the plot, the film in general is just chalked up as 'another film I saw, once'.",Conan the Barbarian

It is a teensy bit crap in places, there's an iffy cgi monster, a few crummy props and stunts that look as though they belong in a 1980's TV sword and sorcery series but those are kind of forgivable. What really wrecks this flick, is that it's Conan played gay, forget Rose McGowan's recommendation for Jason Momoa's arse, that's not even the worse part, it's the fact that Momoa comes over about as hard as a sherry trifle, wobbling on tea trolley with three wheels. I mean it's like he's looking for the mirror all the time, he even gives the camera a hair toss on more than one occasion, what is this, a Cadbury's flake ad? When you consider the legacy of the 1980's Conan, a film that broke all the rules, that caused the blue rinses in the press to wet their knickers and that still stands today as a mold breaking epic, it's all such a terrible shame.

132,jayce2279,"It's actually not bad, but I recommend watching it in 2D",7,20 March 2017,"I first watched this version in a movie theater in 2011 which only played it in 3D. I remember at the time I thought they had focused too much on digital effects and that the film was over the top. But since I am a Conan the Barbarian buff and I like Jason Momoa as an actor, I eventually decided to give it another chance and see it on DVD, this time in 2D. It was almost like I was watching a different movie and I can't for the life of me understand why I disliked it so much the first time I saw it. I remembered it being a clean, kid- friendly reboot with lots of over the top action scenes, sort of along the lines of the Marvel superhero movies, but the production design is actually very similar to the John Milius version and it's not far behind on violence and nudity. Of course, it does make use of digital effects, but by far not as often as I got the impression it did when I watched the 3D version and most of the action scenes are actually along the lines of those in the 1982 version or other more traditional sword fighting movies. Maybe I just wanted them to make a sequel to the Schwarzenegger films so badly I never gave this version a fair chance. I still think the original Conan the Barbarian is the superior movie, but now that I have watched it again without any expectations or prejudices (and in 2D), I have to admit this reboot is actually not bad at all and definitely better than the 1984 sequel they did make to the first film.",Conan the Barbarian

Conan is the archetype, the Gold standard if you will, against which all mythical heroes are measured. Of course, my acquaintance with Conan began when I was a teenager back in the 1960's and I had occasion to actually read the Robert E. Howard Conan stories. No movie, version, or modern rendition of Conan can ever measure up to the Conan vision I enjoyed as a kid in my mind's eye, but Conan is such a powerful, charismatic, and decisive hero that no matter who portrays him or what avenue he appears in, Conan always stands head and shoulders above the rest.

In my opinion, this was a great movie and I think Mr. Howard would have thought this story and portrayal much more along the lines of his original imagination.Don't pay attention to the skeptics, if you like the Conan stories by Robert E Howard, you'd be hard pressed not to at least enjoy the ride...Myself, I'm looking forward to the next story, and hope there will be many more on the way towards Conan the King!!!",Conan the Barbarian

It's a wet Sunday afternoon: which would you rather crack a beer and watch, 'The English Patient' or 'Gold Finger'?This film entertained me; the time passed and I found that for the scales weighing enjoyment against annoyance, enjoyment had won out.Yes, the first twenty-five minutes were in a different class to the rest of the film and it is a pity that this good start was not carried through to the end. There were things wrong with this film. Script, emotion and tight direction were often lacking, yet there was generally good pacing and cinematography.At the end the main redeeming feature was that there was some coherence to the story and that it did follow from beginning to end. The use of the sword as link throughout the film was under used and at times almost forgotten, yet it still helped maintain a story line with basic closure. I have no real problem with the absence of dialogue; there are many ways to tell a story and the visual method can work well. That it was not wholly successful here is down to the lack of emotion and atmosphere that was needed to colour the picture in the absence of the vocal interplay.What this film needed was more finish, better thematic and emotional pacing and an overall 'style'. It is not sufficient for just the scenes and the story to be set in some age; life has to be breathed into that age; one needs to feel that one is watching a Cimerian and that his land and culture are real.

140,silverdragon4,Far surpassed my expectations,8,15 January 2012,"OK, finished Conan the Barbarian (2011) I so hoped that this wasn't going to be a bad remake. And it wasn't. The only two similarities to the original is the name and the way it began. Everything else was just like a new film.Stephen Lang (Avatar, Terra Nova etc) as Khalar Zym. He played that part perfect. He had the look of evil and used it well. I was well impressed by his acting in this. His Armour looked brilliant The main role of Conan was played by Jason Momoa. Not known for his film acting, but mostly for TV series such as Stargate Atlantis and Game of Thrones. Even with only being in a couple of TV films, his acting was great pulling off a superb role of a Barbarian. Khalar Zyms' daughter Marique was played by Rose McGowan, best know for her role as Paige in Charmed. A nasty piece of work in this film, A Necromancer. The makeup made her look real nasty looking too. She played a great role. Tamara was played by Rachel Nichols. I don't remember seeing her in much, but apparently she had a bit part in Star Trek (2009) and has been in the series Criminal Minds. Now, I have to mention the part played by Ron Perlman. One of my favourite actors know for his role as Hellboy Also his role in Sons of Anarchy. And his voice to multiple computer games including the Narrator for every Fallout game, Halo 2&3 and many more. He plays the role of Conans' father Corin. Fantastic actor, fantastic role, even if it was a short one.The action in this is great. The sword fights will make any fan of such films happy. Lots of blood, some sexual content, great acting, great story. All in all a great film. Anyone who liked films like the original Conan the Barbarian, The Scorpion King, Red Sonya...you WILL love this.",Conan the Barbarian
141,giannis_maggos,Looks good but lacks Imagination,3,2 June 2018,So I heard about this movie before but I never get to watch it. I spptted Last night on Tv and I say What the hell let's watch it . I have to say the Visuals and some of the actions scenes were good but the movie overall is a Generic Fantasy film full of Cliches and Terrible Dialogues. Don't waste your time in this movie,Conan the Barbarian
142,Harvest-R,Brilliant fast paced action movie,8,14 October 2011,"I just returned from cinema watching this movie and I give it a 8 of 10.I'm a Conan fan since Schwarzenegger's ""Conan - The Barbarian"" from 1982, I read all Robert E. Howard's Conan novels and played the ""Age of Conan - Hyborian Adventures"" MMO for a long time. So my review maybe a bit biased.This Conan movie got all what the heart of a Conan fan desires: Beautiful landscapes, sexy women, black humor and sarcasm, violence and gore, strong and honorable men, fierce enemies and monsters and lots of fighting scenes.Yes, it may be not perfect and has some flaws. But nonetheless I personally found it very entertaining and exciting. For me there was no moment of boredom or the desire that the movie will hopefully end soon - rather the opposite.If you like movies which touch the relentless warrior and hero within yourself you'll probably also like this Conan movie.",Conan the Barbarian
143,dr-cheyno,"Bad, especially the first 10 mintues.. (actually, it was all bad) Typical mindless Hollywood crap.",5,6 July 2018,"Is Hollywood really trying to make people dumber for having watched rubbish like this.
The Second scene in the movie shows a 12yo Conan take out 4 fully armed and grown men unarmed. Apparently even though he weighs about 45kg max it was no problem to over power them. He also knew martial arts..This is close to the stupidest thing i have ever seen in a movie. *If you are a fan of Conan like me, just don't watch it.
*If you have even the slightest bit of intelligence, just don't watch it.
*If you have a shred of decency for yourself, do NOT watch it.If you are an idiot, watch this movie and rate it in between 7 & 10.That is all. 
Don't say i didn't warn you.Edit: I forced myself to watch the rest of the movie and thank god it moved on from kid wonder, but if the book was anything like this it must have been an incredibly small book.
Other reviewers say it is true to the book. I say thank god that was one of the books i never read..In fact i'm sure the book could never of been this bad. But as a book reader myself i know that some fans will enjoy even the crappiest of movies if it stays somewhat true to the book, as the original Conan movie with Arnie would be extremely different. But imo as a movie an Arnie B grader is better than Conan 2011 & that says something. Funniest part of the film, watching the juiced up Jason Momoa struggle for like over a minute to pull up the 70kg max, girl on a chain. Bring back the wheel of pain!",Conan the Barbarian
144,weejockxxx,Better than the original,10,24 January 2015,"Being a great Conan fan (of the books) I have been waiting for a realistic depiction on film for years. Until recently all we had were the Arnie movies. To his credit, Arnie looked the part. Solid muscle and a physique which was the envy of most men. However his acting left a lot to be desired and the dialogue wasn't the most scintillating. Enter Jason Momoa in a film directed with enthusiasm by Marcus Nispel, narrated by the ever entertaining Morgan Freeman and starring the aforementioned Mr Mamoa whose muscles could do the acting for him but he doesn't let them. Playing the child warrior who sees his father (Ron Perlman) brutally murdered with himself forced to play an unwilling part, Conan grows to be the eponymous hero we know and love. The effects are great, the acting solid, the dialogue crisp and the love interest, involving Rachel Nichols, is understated and realistic. All in all, a great improvement on the original.",Conan the Barbarian
145,TreeOfWolf,Unbearably sexist,1,26 August 2016,"I couldn't watch the whole movie, but I doubt it got better.I watched the 1982 version before watching it. Conan became a slave who was forced to be barbaric to survive, but then had the chance to discover the value of his own freedom, friendship... and love. Falling for a woman who helped him fight, as an equal, for revenge and everyone's justice at the same time. She ends up sacrificing herself to save him when he was helpless.The new version is completely different. It shows an arrogant guy who uses the word ""woman"" in a derogatory way, calling her his property and bossing her around. When she says that she doesn't have to obey him just because he's a man... he freaking gags her! That's where I stopped watching the movie. She had the dignity and courage to stand up for herself, and he wouldn't even listen, forcefully, with no respect whatsoever. That's a horrible message to give the new generation of women and men.I am ashamed that the women rights actually got worse 30 years later! Women are born to live their life, not to serve a man's life. Men shouldn't stay helpless babies needing a mommy to serve them all their lives.No amount of amusing gore can make up for this disaster. I like slasher movies with psychopaths killing sluts and I laugh while they scream. But I couldn't stand watching this respectable woman be degraded. The psychological violence was so nasty that it felt worse than murder. Weird but true. I can understand a psychopath's madness... but trying to make abusing women seem like a normal manly thing to do... it repulsed me.The story is so different that it shouldn't be called the same way, but the film makers probably tried to use the old one's fame to seem more interesting than they tried to be. Lame trick. The old movie had more depth in silent stares than anything that came out of the new Conan's mouth.Stick with the Arnold version. Terminate this horrible remake.Old crap is way better than this new crap.I guess that if you're a misogynist, you won't see anything wrong with this movie.Otherwise, don't bother.",Conan the Barbarian
146,poisoncupcake74,Excellent movie!!!,9,8 December 2011,"I don't know why this has so many bad reviews unless its because people generally do not like remakes.This however is WAY better than the 1982 version and its a shame more people aren't going to see it if they are swayed by the bad reviews.Jason Mamoa is actually a good actor, way better than Arnold Schwarzenegger and there are NOT ridiculous one liners that Schwarzenegger is famous for. The story is awesome and there is action throughout the entire film, it has fantastic Gore as well as comedic moments, and it wasn't boring at any time.The ONLY part I didn't like, which is why I gave it 9 out of 10 stars is because of the way he leaves his beloved. Everyone in the room watching it with me was like ""Really?"" They shared a lot in the film and he leaves her with nothing more than have a nice life? That was the only flaw.I recommend this film, it is very entertaining, funny, action-packed, romantic, nice Gore, and a couple parts are frightening and sad. Everything you want in a movie, with Jason Mamoa's gorgeous body included.",Conan the Barbarian
147,Jeremy_brewer1,Needs new storyline,3,20 July 2012,Conans bitch should have been done by a different actor and as a total different character. The woman with the claws played to much as a different character which of course reminds you of Catwoman. Without her claws she really isn't a threat to be worried about. Conan should have been played by a different actor as well. He wasn't nearly as a barbarian as when Arnold Swarseneger played back in the 80s. This is a total thumbs down remake. Maybe they should of used a different director for a batter plot. Besides how would a mask that resembles a octopus going to help anybody out. It gave him no extra strength or anything besides make him look more of a dumb ass.,Conan the Barbarian
148,Z-Trifonova,Worth watching,10,8 July 2013,"Although the rating of the movie was 5.1 I decided to watch it since the actor is very attractive. Watching the movie without having the expectations to be good I was satisfied with how it turned out. The story was interesting, not hard to understand and throughout the whole movie you new its purpose which I really liked. There was some kind of romance in the movie...it's great that it didn't change the movie story line - it was supposed to be adventure/fantasy movie and that's what it was. The actors were good and for me not very famous which is great cause every you need new faces in the movie industry...at least I need them...The characters didn't have much development but for that kind of movie they were good enough for me. In conclusion I recommend this movie to everyone.",Conan the Barbarian
149,SamiCybertron,Jason Momoa was born to play Conan.,8,24 January 2012,"Conan the Barbarian as a franchise has been around for quite a long time and stands strong throughout fiction. The long haired, sword wielding barbarian that kills anything that gets in his way has had a series of well written novels & comics, TV shows and movies and from one adaptation to another its been a mixed bag.When it comes to Conan as a movie however, everyone is a aware of the 1982 Conan starring Arnold Schwarzenegger and the amount of critical praise. Yet as enjoyable as that film was it was not 100% Conan, it was just a movie that had his name attached to it and completely inaccurate to the stories Robert E Howard wrote so many years ago.Fast forward many years later to 2011, news started to grow of another Conan the Barbarian movie and I was very excited to see which direction it was going, Honestly the final result of this movie was that it was a very enjoyable, incredibly violent, beautifully made and 100% loyal Conan the Barbarian film. The film is directed by Marcus Nispel, a director who has been known to direct one bad remake after the other with very few good films, but seeing the style of this film when it comes Conan...Marcus was a very good choice for directing this movie in that his early works like Pathfinder and how dark and gritty the film was worked perfectly for this movie in that Conan has always been a dark and gritty high adventure fantasy epic.Casting wise with an exception of people like Stephan Lang as the main villain Khlar Zym and Rose McGowan as Marique - Zym's daughter they were fine choices and even though there roles were over the top, they were well casted for the parts they have.The one actor who was the most accurate of all was Jason Momoa as Conan the Barbarian for a couple of reasons, Momoa looks more like Conan as described and behaves and acts as Conan is described more so than Schwarzenegger ever was. I really feel Momoa was perfectly casted as the lead role and delivered the role very violently and very over the top and it was fun to see Momoa play the icon Barbarian.So when it boils down to it, This movie is and will always be far more loyal to the original source material that E Howard wrote than the Conan that came out in 1982, the film was decently made and the enjoyable to watch and really helped revive Conan to the big screen in the 21st century, is the film perfect? No but that is nothing a sequel cant fix, I really feel the negative reception was uncalled for when this film was very good. So I would highly recommend this movie to fans of the Conan the Barbarian franchise, novels and all and to any cinema goers altogether.I am holding out hope a sequel will be made but sadly as the movie going public is, it's hard to see sequels made to movies that really deserve & need them.",Conan the Barbarian
150,doom-ca,weak sauce,3,6 December 2011,"Ouch this is a weak movie,the script is soft with little to no substance and the plot line is thin at best. If you are looking for an action packed sword and saucer movie pass this up and delve into the archives. Horrible acting, stereotyped characters, and over the top fight scenes equal an hour and a half of your life you won't get back. While the sets are reasonable and the barbarians ripped muscles will sure to please some starved house wives, its just not enough to make up for all the short comings of the movie. In addition, the moves feels like it is designed for a 13 year old boy to enjoy, with the overly simplistic plot and over the top violence but seems to have an r rating to the content. In short, you'll wonder why they even bothered to make such a blunder in the first place.",Conan the Barbarian

I always find that because people see a recognizable name like Conan they instantly start to judge and compare it to the book, or a previous film. So let me start by getting a few things stated, this is not a portrayal of Conan in terms of reference to books. I do not know if the Director was attempting to play his Conan as Robert E Howards, but one day i would love Conans life to come to life on the big screen.What it is, is a very enjoyable action film, fast paced with lots of action. I found it well shot, well acted for an action film with the usual storyline of vengeance.I gave it a 9 mainly because i don't think it was being given a fair crack of the whip, all in all its just a good fun movie.

That goes without saying, but this movie already had an incredibly high bar to reach so it's best not to compare, otherwise it'll just end badly for this film. Saying this, I have to admit I kind of enjoyed this movie. It's overly dependant on CGI, kinda derivitave and the pacing is just weird at times, but it's still pretty enjoyable. Jason Momoa looks great as Conan, Rose McGowan and Ron Perlman were great as always, and for all the shaky cam and CGI, the action is, objectively, pretty cool to watch. Sure it's not Arnie swinging a broadsword into his enemies face, but if you take it for what it is, it's nowher near as bad as what some of the ""great action scenes"" of the 21st century claim is exciting.",Conan the Barbarian

The characters had no depth at all and the talented cast had absolutely no script to work with. The action sequences were well choreographed and brutally detailed, but the too fast action and hatchet job editing turned this possibly watchable movie into a nightmare. It makes the original version look full of well rounded characters. Slick editing, good continuity, a well thought out script and good production values.

But the longer it went on, the more I appreciated once again how great the Milius/Schwarzenegger Conan was back in the day.With this cast, which is actually quite good, and script, which, while far from good, is at least passable, a good director could have made a fairly solid Conan movie. Unfortunately, Marcus Nispel is pretty much the opposite of a good director and so we get a series of flat, uninvolving scenes with characters we don't care about and a lot of senseless carnage. Some of it looks kind of nice, but the bad editing and shaky camera-work ruin that, too. The bland music doesn't help, either.I'll admit that there are one or two action scenes that are at least watchable, but they don't make up for the sloppy, half-assed feel of the movie as a whole.",Conan the Barbarian

158,fatt1988,Conan The Retard,3,8 December 2011,"I had some doubt on this movie long before watching it. Most movies like this one always give me disappointment rather than an enjoyment moment in my life. Anyway I thought about giving it a go and that's it. The prologue of this movie looks promising. However, as the movie goes further the story is getting boring and all the actions just lame. You just won't be able to catch the action and all of a sudden you only see someone died. The storyline is too typical. Conan lost his family and his tribe, Conan seek for vengeance, Conan meets a girl, Conan saves a girl, Conan 'sleep' with the girl, Conan lose the girl to bad people, Conan saves the girl one more time and they live happily ever after. I just wish to see more twist in this movie, not some crappy old-school storyline. Even a remake doesn't has to be the same as the original since there is no point in making a new movie with same or similar title and similar plot. The daughter of Khalar Zym, Marique was shown to possess a great magical power as she summons the sand men (warriors made of sand) to attack Conan and his girlfriend but later she never shows any other magic that she has when she fights Conan and the pure blood at the end of the movie. What kind of sorcerer is that if she could only use her power once? And Khalar Zym himself, the mask should give him some kind of power but what I see was just a lame sword fighting. Then it would be ridiculous for him to search the mask for many years as it only gives him nothing more than a stupid looking mask.

162,Rabensblut,Much more better than other Action films done this day,8,24 August 2011,"first of all I will say my point of view as a film viewer, Conan fan, REH purist and all in all as a man with a open mind. This film made me puzzled...the directing could be better, the story is quite good, as for Conan I know worse than this, but the funny elements as catapult, catapulted my mood directly the opposite way and the egg race was dumb (proven to be a warrior with running with eggs in your mouth ???? I thought proving that you are a man was breaking the neck of a Cimmerian Bull). Small things that make the film just silly like going on a trip around hyborian inland with a ship. On the other hand parts as the dweller and Acheron made me really satisfied having that REH Cthulhu mythos stories look , plus the scenery was great. Jason as Conan is great at least he can move and has a voice for Conan. Conan is no Bodybuilder, he is a Savage (or as many call him a barbarian, although I do not like to use the word). The others - Lang, great, Perlman (one of my fav. actors) could show more, but did not have so much space, Tamara and others - hmm playing the second violin to Conan as the others except of Lang, who is a great baddie, but hey, this is no soap opera here, it is Conan, that has to be straightforward action, and that this film deliveres. From the REH point of view, There were lots of remarks (Tower of the elephant, Yara, Zingara, Acheron ...) so I liked it a lot this way, since this is an origin story of Conan and thus something like a ""Welcome back it's so long we missed you"" film. If they will do the Frost Giant's daughter/Queen of the black coast (Sean Hood all alone script no Oppenheimer crap) as part two, then I can accept this number one without Howard's story (1982 and 1984 were also Howardless stories as well). All in all, compared to the comics adaptations and other action films done this day, this one stands strong, it is a love it or hate film for all film viewers, Conan fans, REH purists. It is indeed a film that divides and devours as a slice of the Conan's sword. I give it a Action film 10/10 (hell yeah) Good film with philosophy and characters 05/10 (poorly written) Conan fim 10/10 (definitely it is Conan) Momoa 10/10 (Momo has potential for the future and Conan suites him) REH purist 07/10 (still missed some expectations)PROS - athmosfere, locations, Khalar and Marique, action and Momo CONS - bad dialogues and script, egg race, big ship ""sailing"" through Hyboria (come on) and catapultall in all I give it 8/10 hoping for the Frost Giant's daughter/Queen of the black coast sequel",Conan the Barbarian
163,MisterHOH,This is NOT Conan,1,20 November 2011,"I am 28 and Conan was one of my favorite characters growing up. I'm gonna keep this short because I don't want to waste any more time on this garbage.The original Conan film had more meaning in it than a thousand 2011 Conan remakes. It was about days of high adventures, the primordial relationship between man and divinity, duality motifs, ancient myths about death and rebirth, morality as an entity not seen only through a narrow view corresponding to today's standards and etiquette, human evolution for better or worse, a one man's struggles with life and destiny and the list can go on. My point is that even if you disliked the original, at the end of it, you still can take something positive from it.I pity today's generation of kids for this reason in general. Films today are made only for the sake of profit, they are rushed, contain no original ideas and unidimensional characters, bombard the viewer with 3d and visual effects nonsense and at the end of it the audience remains a hollow shell void of any original thought because the film takes all decisions for them. This is not the art of cinematography, it is blatant garbage. Conan 2011 is no exception to this. It is flawed in every aspect of the film-making process but not from a technical point of view. Hollywood makes sure that Technology is atop of their priorities.To summarize Conan 2011; all the elements of the movie come together to create a cocktail that is bad smelling, bad tasting, doesn't give satisfaction while drinking it and it cant even quench thirst after you drank it. I am unable to go more into detail because i was really repulsed and I regret seeing it. As a fan, I have been utterly betrayed and totally let down by the new Conan. Please buy the original which is now even on Blu-Ray disk. It is an immeasurable better movie and experience than the new version. Forget that Conan 2011 ever existed.",Conan the Barbarian

The movie was basically many action sequences stitched together into a 2 hours long movie. No one would expect much story in this movie, but the action sequences were not good either. The first few action sequences were serviceable, but they quickly grew tiresome. The actors and actresses are not bad and I loved to watch Stephen Lang being a villain.

166,D-Day77,Ignore Conan this is Rise of the barbarian,6,6 June 2021,"First off I love the original Barbarian and despite a lacklustre sequel (destroyer) and a poor spin off (red Sonja) I've still remained a fan of the IP the short lived TV series also had a few moments. So I was eager to see this remake but there is one of the reasons it did not do well, this is not a remake, it's an entirely new story and should be referred to as a reboot.There is still a strong revenge fuelled Conan, there is still witchcraft and scorcery which all tick the box in what I'd expect from a Conan film,, plus the gore is pretty good so it's on par with the original rather than the Aimee at kids follow ons.My problem with this is sadly Jason Mamoa, he is no Arnold Schwartzenegger and the vision of Conan has been for 30 years that or arnie. Mamoa had big shoes to fill and it cannot be done through no fault of his own it's just arnie is arnie and the originals got it right. This film has so much right but for me, loose the title , loose the character name , call it Rise of the Barbarian give him a name like Thorg and you've got a very decent sword and scorcery movie.It fails as it was hoping to lure the fans of the original rather than stand alone. Like nearly all remakes / reboots / reimagined what evers .I think my greatest sadness over this film is that because it failed at the box office, we didn't get the Rose McGowan Red Sonja film, which from the teaser posters would have been epic.To sum up, this film is great if you class it as a non Conan film .But it is no epic, then neither were the originals.Give it a second watch and like I say ignore the Conan branding .",Conan the Barbarian

Well, let me explain.When I call it unwatchable I am referring more to how dark the picture was filmed and mastered so therefore 'unwatchable' on a technical level. As far as the acting and story yeah it's not the best either. I am a huge fan of Milius' original as well as a fan of the character created so long ago. Nispel's take on the Cimmerian misses the mark in many ways yet I am perhaps kinder to it than I should be for all those very same reasons.At the end of the day, I'm thankful to have a Conan film to strain my vision watching even if it's not the best.

168,Sausage_Demon,Flashes of good with a majority of bad.,1,18 August 2011,"First, I would like to say I love Howard's stories. I also like the 82 film. So that this deviates from Howard a little (or a lot) isn't really a bother to me.Now, before I get to the review I want to say to anyone out there studying film (like myself) to watch this movie. It will prove to you that no matter how much action, blood or one liners you squeeze into a movie, if the story and characterization are missing you don't have a movie.Without ANY disrespect, I would urge Mr. Nispel to do a film course, as he clearly needs to learn story telling at its most basic. This is not an insult, this is advice, because I believe once he has a better grasp on it, he will make a fine film maker.Conan the Barbarian is a summer movie. Sadly this also has become synonymous with stupid, bad movies. And this film doesn't escape that. Clearly this film had a lot of trouble, by the looks of it at the conceptual stage. The fact the Sean Hood had to rewrite on set proves the material they had to work with was a disaster, and it shows.Donelley and Oppenheimer (forgive my spelling) did a poor job on the script, if, what was shown in the final cut was more or less what they wrote. Mr. Hood's rewrites I heard were quite well received, but I also hear they cut most of what he wrote out of the cinematic cut...This film, cursed with a poor script fails at even just an entertainment level. Sure, there is lots of action and fighting, but there is no emotion behind it. I was actually bored half way through of the fighting and wanted some damn character scenes, of which there are none of note. And that is another problem, after the first act (young Conan) nobody has any character. They walk around, kill or die and that is all. Their motivations are given to us in a single line and that is all.The cast were good, but they had nothing to work with. The directing was inconsistent, the mood was all over the place, at times it smelt of a less fun Scorpion King with Artus and Elan-sha (I know I got those names wrong) being out of place ""comic relief"". Stephen Lang, as usual is good, but again, he has nothing to work with, so he stands and acts mean a lot.The one thing that really took me out of the world of the film, is the dialogue. Which lacks any sort of finesse, culture, period etc. It sounds like modern speech... which is one thing it shouldn't sound like. Imagine watching a Western where they all talk in modern American slang, that is what this dialogue felt like. It was dialogue you write in your first draft, then go back over and make it good...though it seems no one did in Conan.The film looked nice, I'll give it that. Some scenes were too bright and conflicted with the mood, but again, the mood changed as often as it would in an angst ridden teenager. The CGI wasn't bad, it wasn't great but it was serviceable.The Dweller scene was pathetic. There was no choreography, set up to it, Momoa literally stood in one spot for most of it and did just ducked around a lot. Clearly a complete failure in the directing department for this scene which had no climax.Costume and wardrobe design was impressive. Lang's armour and get up were nice, McGowan looked sexy in a freaky kind of way. So visually it almost always worked.Overall, I suggest seeing it if you are curious, it isn't the worst thing to happen to cinema by a long shot. But, with no story, at least none that is told in a coherent way, no character development or motivation and no sense of culture or the world the characters (caricatures) inhabit it not only fails as a Conan movie, it fails as a movie. It fails as a coherent story told with moving pictures, it breaks the very foundation of cinema's rules. It cannot engage an audience, because there is nothing for us to care about. As a video game, this would kick arse. As a movie, it falls on it.",Conan the Barbarian
169,derekblake,How to Make a Movie in the Dark,2,20 August 2011,"I am struggling to actually review this movie, not because of its weak story-line or because of its total lack of imagination, or even because of its gratuitous violence (most of which is hidden), but because the one thing that was missing was a lighting engineer. Yes folks, this is an object lesson in how to make a low budget blockbuster movie, though how much money was actually saved by shooting seventy-five percent of the film in darkness I don't know. However the other cost saving was certainly well designed, a few decent cameramen who could actually keep the shot in focus would have spoiled the whole thing for me. Out of focus darkness was entertaining for the first ten minutes, after that it became irritating, the big fight scene in the last ten minutes of the film is lost completely but then that will have saved on the cost of giving the monster too much detail, rather than leaving it a a piece of wet hose pipe. What a waste of time and money, not the production companies, but mine, I can sit in the dark with some flickering lights at home for free. There was one decent fight scene in the film about half way through, but it was certainly not worth the ticket price. One of the worst and most irritating films I have seen for a long time.",Conan the Barbarian
170,fk7951,big flop of the year.,1,13 September 2011,"The Movie doesn't go with the original comics from 1970 - 1993 (Marvel - Conan the Barbarian). What I see is complete mess and I find no point why the director has created this movie. It would be more wise to read old comics instead of watching this crap. I think 'Christopher Nolan' should be given this movie to re-make so that Conan's name is not spoiled further. There were not strong characters in the movie as 'BELIT'(Conan's first girlfriend). Also, we couldn't see 'RED SONJA' the special character who always interpret Conan with her skills and fights. There was no fight which showed Conan as a mark which he showed in Comics. I think the movie itself was made in self characterized manner and with alternate story without the original link to the comics and which I feel didn't attracted more people in entertainment point of view. The director should have better read few 1-100 comics to know what Conan is exactly capable of and what the real dark side of the Conan is. Conan's character is well defined in Comics than what we actually see here. I feel the previous movie starring 'Arnold Schwarzenegger' was much better and thrilling than this Crap. I was completely disappointed with this movie and hope this will be remade in the future by some better director.",Conan the Barbarian
171,irishmonster,"Terrible, boring, bad.",2,26 November 2011,"What an absolutely terrible movie. No plot, bad casting, awful acting, and terrible effects make this one of the worst movies I've ever seen. What a complete waste of time. I actually fell asleep twice while watching! This piece of garbage drags along with no real direction, moving from scene to scene with no explanation. Jason Momoa may look kind of like the Conan of the comic book and the book covers, and though he hits some cool poses with a sword, he brings nothing else to the table in this ugly reboot. Ron Pearlman as Conan's father is another example of bad casting. All in all, this was an extremely disappointing 2 hours of my life.",Conan the Barbarian

He's strong, abrasive, bloodthirsty, and bears conviction. The cast as a whole really gave the film the highest rating I could give it.Also Good: Hyboria. The Picts looks quite terrifying early in the film, even if they fall like straw men. The film did a nice job exploring a few other areas of Hyboria that the 80's films never did. All in all, those who read the old books will find a lot of Easter eggs to enjoy here.The Bad: The final act of the movie was just as boring as could be. Why do we care what the villain does with this really weird-looking octopus mask? The final battle sequence was a critical failure that ended the film with a whimper instead of a ""Wow!""Also Bad: Action sequences. There are many throughout the film and for each that will sincerely impress you, there are equally as many that are simply laughable. The Ugly: The director, Marcus Nispel, may have given some fresh life to Hyboria, but at the cost of a coherent story and developed characters. You will reach the end of the movie knowing just as much about the characters as when you first started watching it. There's no depth to the characters (hero and villain alike). Character development is forgotten entirely. The stakes of the story are lost in a hodgepodge of randomly strung-together action sequences.Overall, there's enough to like about the movie to make it watchable, but not enough to really wow an audience looking for so much more out of this rich universe.",Conan the Barbarian
173,wordmonkey,The Terrible Wrath of Darkest Gods,2,18 August 2011,"Director Marcus Nispel is undoubtedly the long-lost offspring of trash master and fellow German, Uwe Boll, as this film is so profoundly awful on every level that it's hard to think that it wasn't intentionally made this way.Remarkably, the movie gets bad immediately and stays that way. One of its most jarring aspects is that it begins with Morgan Freeman's narration, which sounds so utterly out of place, with his comforting, slightly Southern drawl the total opposite of everything bloody and Cimmerian, that it instantly comes across like self-parody, as if we were seeing some schticky Mel Brooks interpretation after the fact. This ham-handed disregard for appropriate tone haunts every frame of the film.The story fails to find the real Conan -- who in Robert E. Howard's stories is a smart, tough, brutal survivor -- and instead seems to reveal to us the underwhelming idea that Conan's just another hunky sword dude with a knack for slaughter.The script inconsistently sticks to any epic poetic flair in the dialog, so that when such words are delivered, they feel forced and flat. The noted line ""I live, I love, I slay, and I am content,"" is meted out with such lack of panache or feeling that I wanted to wash out Jason Momoa's mouth with soap, right after forcing him to watch Schwarzenegger -- not a great actor, by any means -- deliver the unforgettable tagline: ""To crush your enemies, drive them before you, and to hear the lamentation of their women."" But then again, John Milius bothered to direct his actors.Stephen Lang (Colonel Quaritch of ""Avatar"") is the half-assed villain Khalar Zym, who inspires zero awe and no respect on his whatever quest for some supernatural thingy, which is such an afterthought that you constantly forget about it. And post plastic-surgery Rose McGowan as his witchy daughter Marique is so outrageously goth that you half-wish for a Sisters of Mercy musical cue every time she steps on camera; if only her performance received the same attention as her over-the-top costumes. Ron Perlman, as Conan's father, is simply wasted. Weep!I'm totally sick of the short-attention-span style of storytelling. The filmmakers are so afraid that if some big action sequence doesn't occur every ten minutes, that we'll be bored; and of course, this quickly has the opposite effect, as we instead become bored from so much pointless, poorly shot and edited action unsupported by character or story. Video games often have more character development than this film, and yes, I'm specifically thinking of the comparatively Shakespearean struggles portrayed in Donkey Kong.I bestowed two stars on this flick, as the second is for unintentional hilarity, of which the film has much. Its hyperbolic Hyborian cartoonishness makes you either wince or chuckle derisively. Hopefully, as many heads as roll on screen will also roll in Hollywood for this abortive, dreadful garbage.Perhaps the noble Conan will someday get his proper due in a modern film. But not today.",Conan the Barbarian

Should you want ass kicking, just watch the Ultimate Fighting Championship, at least they're real fights where the biggest man can get KO by a single punch, not a godlike kid slaying 15+ fighters without even getting a scratch. Crap ! Momoa really stands as Conan (?) I though Momoa was really excellent in Game of Thrones, which is actually another proof that a very good actor can be really very bad if directed by a guy with absolutely no talent and no vision. Crap again ! The movie respects R.E.Howard's writing (?). I've not read Conan, but if it does then simply Howard's not Tolkien, and his writing is... crap again ! But again some didn't't like it because... it has no 3D. Come on guys, would you grow up a bit ? Movies aren't disneys rollercoasters ! So, in summary, crap, crap, crap and crap again ! I too didn't like the original... when I was 10. Since then, I evolved and understood that even it has a curious cast ( Arnold being one of the worst actors ever, Sandhal Bergman being a dancer and not an actor ), they were such brilliantly directed by Milius that they gave birth to a really poetic vision of sword & sorcery, summarized in the first scene ( Conan's father being a simple prop of the set, again brilliantly directed ) : ""for no one in this world can you trust, not beast, not men... this you can trust"" and served by probably the best picture soundtrack ever written ( by Mr Poledouris ).I'll go watch it again to wash myself of this ridiculous nonsense of modern movie making which makes me sicker and sicker !",Conan the Barbarian

The cast, visuals, score by Tyler Bates, action sequences, and direction by Nispel are perfect, and while the story is flawed, I don't think it detracts from the film at all. Jason Momoa is awesome as Conan, Stephen Lang is menacing as a Khalar Zym, a villain who, while not as strong as Conan, is extremely smart, and Ron Perlman's Corin, the father of Conan, is rough but caring as a father, and even though he is only in the film for fifteen minutes, he conveys his brutality as a leader and love as a father flawlessly.

Nothing to do with the original Basil Poledouris' masterpiece.I am giving this movie a 5/10 rating only because I am a huge fan of Conan, and for the first 15 minutes which reminded me of the old Conan movie.

178,maclaird1,Oh My God...It is time to bring out the pitchforks and torches.,1,27 August 2011,"First off let me preface that I am a movie junkie. I rarely hate a movie and will find as much good as I can in one. My friends feel that I love everything regardless of merit. That being said I have to state that this movie was the WORST film I have seen in decades. After about 1n hour and 20 minutes I got up, walked out and got a refund. The last movie I did that for was the awful Bo Derek Tarzan movie. This movie has NOTHING to do with Conan. The writers should never be allowed to work in cinema again if this is the kind of trash they are going to pass off. I can understand being lazy and not wanting to some up with something new but to take something established and just crap all over it and expect to get paid for it is beyond belief. Most of the casting was terrible. There are actors in this movie which are fine in the right film but this movie was not one of them. The story thinks that by using the name Conan and mentioning the heart of the elephant in passing that they have done their due diligence. The characters are as flat as they can be and when talking about Conan this says something. Conan in the books is VERY 2 dimensional so I expected that. This movie in fact makes them 1 dimensional. The speech patterns are reminiscent of any modern ""look at how hip we are"" movie, and the story has nothing to do with any kind of real plot. The costuming is atrocious and the music is a cacophony which only serves to distract and usually can't even manage that. I would wholly recommend that all actors involved in this have their names removed and the people who actually wrote directed and made this abortion never be paid to foist off this awful awful garbage on an unsuspecting public again. Free would be too expensive to see this. When you check your watch 4 times in the first hour it is time to throw in the towel.",Conan the Barbarian

Asylum movies are straight trash, but you know what to expect, and you know what you're getting into. This movie should be soooooo much better than it is, it's so disappointing. It's the wasted potential that makes this movie so bad. The story is too stupid, and the editing and pacing is just dreadful. This movie is afraid to slow down and just let moments breathe, so you feel absolutely exhausted by the end (if you can actually make it to the end, that is). I'd love to see Momoa get another opportunity to play Conan, but I do believe between this movie's failure and Momoa's success as Aquaman, we won't see him get a second go-around.",Conan the Barbarian

Momoa as Conan was a great choice, as he fits the look of Conan perfectly. The action scenes are shot well and it is gruesome too. The CGI is fairly decent, and I found the villain to be a pretty cool one as well. There are a few gripes, but for me, I loved it as much as the Arnie one. Score is pretty good too, and has that Hyborian feel to it just like in the games and books. This is a love it or hate it movie, and I can totally understand why.

182,Lodewickus,Don't believe the haters...completely.,7,9 November 2011,"I'd admit that I was one of the skeptics based on the negative reviews and word of mouth. In the end I figured why not and gave it a shot.I was pleasantly surprised what it turned out to be. I enjoyed the original, but also looked at this one for what it is. Same characters, different vision.Jason Momoa really did an excellent job at conveying a man without fear. It's not an Oscar performance, but the role doesn't call for that kind of acting. Considering the time he had to prepare for the role, he became very proficient with the sword. While Conan is cutting the enemy down limb by limb, you'll believe it.Having Rachel Nichols not play the usual damsel in distress was also a nice surprise. Rachel and Jason bounced nicely off each others' chatter. The change in her persona was badly dealt with tho, in that it wasn't convincing what and how the story told it.Stephen Lang and the rest of the co-stars were all convincing enough. I do think that Ron Perlman could have had a bit more aggression, but he played the caring father well enough to make up for it.Which gives way to the main negative about the film. Inconsistent editing ruins the continuity between scenes. Luckily it's not half as bad as people make it out too be, there are far worse movies, but it is distracting.The other gripe is the dialog. Albeit I wasn't expecting smart and witty dialog, I had to remember that people living in such a time won't be the smartest cookies. That doesn't distract from the fact it could have had a little bit of smarts added.Really apart from that it was honestly not that bad at all. Music was forgettable, but fitting. Sound effects did a good enough job at resounding the noise of steel blades sparking each other or the sound of limbs flying. CGI did its part, not exactly ILM or Weta, but hey, it worked, especially the establishing shots.If you enjoy fantasy that carries some maturity and shows the way such a time would be like to be in, you'll enjoy Conan for what it is. One brutal warrior without fear pursuing utter revenge and completely obliterates his enemies through the sword.",Conan the Barbarian
183,mandelmanden,Lighthearted but fun.,7,28 August 2011,"I went to see Conan the Barbarian in 2D (naturally) after a few beers at the end of a long day. I had seen a couple of reviews, heard a few opinions, and it was apparently the worst garbage to come out of Hollywood since forever. So, I was very pleasantly surprised when this movie turned out to be quite a lot more fun and probably pretty cool for a handful of kids in their early teens. But we had good fun, despite being rather a lot older than our early teens. At the end of the day, you don't get much more than you could've expected to get from a movie that's basically only about a guy growing up to kill the guy who killed his father. The plot starts out flat and remains flat. In between the start and the end we see a bunch of cool locations, a lot of fighting, a couple of fun moments, a random sex scene, and it sticks pretty true to Conan lore.I wonder if it's at all feasible to make this movie. You have a character that is basically only from a couple of handfuls of pulp short stories from the 30's. A teenage boy's hero, exciting adventures. It's not for the mainstream cinema, at all. It's something for kids in their room, playing Dungeons & Dragons or Descent: Journeys in the Dark, or a sword & sorcery video games.To adults, it's either horrible, or something fun to remind us of a time where we were more easily impressed by the world and its sights. But then, as a person who very much enjoys movies that are so bad they're good, a movie in that category that's also nicely made in general, is a rarity. For those points, I'll give it a 7/10. If you're the nerdy type and dip into a couple of beers, you'll probably enjoy this. Your 13-15 year old son and his mates will also love it no doubt.",Conan the Barbarian

Rachel Nichols also stood out, showing a tough side as Tamara. Ron Perlman was excellent as well.Well worth going, though I'd prefer a non-3D version, which I'll get when I buy it on Bluray.

The two movies are nothing alike and shouldn't be compared at all. That being said, this movie does not attempt to recreate the old one whatsoever, for it would be a futile attempt. Instead of that they focused on a different kind of story.Conan the Barbarian isn't the greatest movie of all time, but it also isn't the worst. Actually I was taken by surprise as to how ""not-bad"" this movie really was, even though I clearly expected it to suck. I wouldn't call it very good, but this new Conan seems to flow very well. Expect lots of action scenes (which are pretty standard for the genre, but not at all unnerving), some nudity (it would be a sin to make a Conan movie without a pair of boobs, and Rachel Nichols provides a set of perfect ones), pretty cliché ending (what would we do without them??), and not a lot from the acting department (you didn't see that one coming, did ya?).Take away the beard from Khal Drogo and you get Conan. It pretty much sums up the movie. If it was more like Game of Thrones, it would be spectacular, but since it wasn't, it isn't. So to sum things up, this movie surprises, due to the fact that it's nothing like the original, it has some beautiful scenes, and the overall look of a movie is expensive and quite nice. Action scenes are pretty standard with lots of sword wielding and spins, they look more like a ballet performance than a fight. Over the top blood spilling looks kind of silly and they should have made it look more realistic. You can expect a few scenes to really get on your nerves, but the movie as a whole is worth a watch.

186,The-Atlantean,Go and watch Arnie again...,2,10 February 2012,"I like Jason Monoa, and I feel for him, swamped by a piece of utterly tripe storytelling. The dialogue was passable, fairly good action without it being epic in any way at all. There are some nice looking props and scenes, and a few of the cast display some reasonable acting talent, when they are given the chance to. But clichéd as hell. Okay, I know this is Conan, the template for all other sword and sorcery, and thus the inventor of the cliché, but this was done in such a ham-fisted and myopic way. The plot was ridiculously contrived and each scene just jumped to the next - ""Conan go here."" ""Okay."" ""Oh look, we're there."" He's trailing the girl and what does he find? One of witch-girl's finger spikes. Like she'd accidentally leave one behind! And a convenient horse just waiting there for him! Actually, the more I think, the more stupid so many things become. Like, when some sort of Kraken is about to eat them, but the guards rush in to fight him anyway, and more are killed by the Kraken in their castle than Conan kills... All of which strips the plotting of any meaning, the film of any atmosphere, and the experience of any worth. As for the true nature of what the film *should* be, the director has as much feel for the exotic nature or the romantic savagery it is intended to portray as a 7-year old. I am saying that specifically, because as a 10-year old I used to choreograph better adventures. I was just an average child, and claim no special skills in this area, but seriously, Nispel, this is pathetic. No loving hand crafted this, and did I mention the story was complete guff? Almost non-existent, actually. I blame the writers, but the director most of all. The man is a complete idiot. He has the pacing and vision of a blind tortoise... with 3 legs, and he has destroyed what should have been a masterpiece. I initially gave the 4 stars, but after writing this, it has dropped to 2.

This Conan doesn't make ridiculous sounds to signify pain as Arnold did in the original (see 1980s pit fighting scene).The bad: acting is laughable at times. Conan is not as muscular as Arnold's Conan of the 1980s and there is something to be said for the physical massiveness in a role like this. A barbarian is apparently capable of lining up a miracle shot with a catapult, can slay five *armed* adults when only a child, and so forth...it's fine that he's exceptional but overdoing it is a common mistake in modern hero films.The original Conan The Barbarian had more artistry (knowing when to show a beheading versus implying one), a vastly better musical score, and excellent costumes/settings. Both movies had some awkward deaths by stunt doubles or extras which could have been done better, this is less excusable in a modern film. Both movies display a wide mix of acting chops but the original is superior here as well. I'd only recommend this newer Conan if for some reason you absolutely cannot find a remastered copy of the 1980s version and you cannot stand older special effectsotherwise it's the original all the way.",Conan the Barbarian
188,finn-palm,It makes me sad,1,14 December 2011,"To have classical writing like that of Robert E Howard at your disposal, and make a movie that is so bad that it isn't even an enjoyable popcorn-flick takes a huge lack of talent. Having followed the process since Paradox Entertainment acquired the rights to Conan from Conan Properties Inc many years ago I have time and again been left dumbfounded at how they completely fail to get the point.Not only is this movie not a good Conan-movie or faithful to Robert E Howard's creation. It also crushes the hopes of us Howard-fans getting one within a foreseeable future. This is the kind of movie that has you yawning and makes you go get snacks without pausing the movie if you're at home, or checking your watch if you're in the theater.To blame for all this is obviously several people rather than one. Many of the producers has had their dirty fingers in it with clauses of right to mess with the product in their contracts. None of them ever thought keeping this true to Robert E Howard would be the key to success, even though so many other productions have proved vastly successful by doing reboots that are faithful. The worst part about all the people in charge on this project is that once they learned that the movie didn't make as much as they hoped they blame it on everything else but themselves. They blame the Conan-brand, they blame the fans and they even have the nerve to make up lies for the poor actors who've worked their asses off trying to make the movie the producers has convinced them that the fans want. So the actors are now left with a bad taste in the mouth and from their comments on panels and interviews you can tell someone withheld the reason the movie bombed from them.This whole project is a mess and it makes me sad.For the actual movie and story itself it's a mix of way too much blood spurting in very unrealistic ways, bad cgi where they haven't even taken into account the way the light falls on the cast, an inability to keep martial arts and parcour out of a movie that is meant to depict a pre-historic age (I have nothing against MA or parcour. I just think that they could have come up with something of their own, that felt more genuine and not constructed), overly fancy and unrealistic swordplay, and finally a story that is completely unnecessary as it is not part of Robert E Howard's work, and it even conflicts with it. How on earth is that faithful? The answer: It isn't.This movie is utter crap. Don't watch it unless someone pays you.",Conan the Barbarian

Author-I've-met-and-had-conversations-with Richard A. Knaak has been contracted to write some very recent Conan novels, but I haven't bothered to pick them up. I like the character of Conan, but there is something very immature about rooting for a barbarian-type to strike out against the ""civilized"" world; that is one type of fantasy story.Another is the revenge fantasy, and that is what director Marcus Nispel gives audiences with his 2011 version of Conan the Barbarian. Where John Milius' 1982 version was a pitch-perfect example of how to tell an epic story – perhaps in a more subdued and grounded manner than can work today – Nispel blends the imagery and pacing from several more recent films (some of them good), making this effort feel a little like a high budget mash-up. Milius's Conan was a conflicted soul driven in equal parts by his own greed, his loyalty to his companions, and a need to come to terms with his father's death. In contrast, Nispel has a Conan who spends the first 22 minutes as a little boy – an extended sequence that did not work for me – then another 15 or so as a rampaging pirate for freedom before he gets on track to seek revenge.Visually, the film is parts Russell Mulcahy's Highlander (1986), TV's Xena (1995-2001; largely in the costuming, but also in some of the action sequences and Conan as a freedom loving pirate), Nispel's own Pathfinder (2004), Mel Gibson's Braveheart (1995), Stephen Sommers' The Mummy (1999), and a fine helping of scenic vistas reminiscent of someone trying to ape Peter Jackson's The Lord of the Rings trilogy (2001-03). The comic book style blood added to the otherwise serviceable action sequences didn't help, but that was still much better than the acrobatic (Xena?) sand spawned creatures (The Mummy?) and a fight sequence that does nothing for the movie. A fair amount of what Nispel cobble together works, even in the hodge-podge style he adopts, but enough of it was jarring to me to keep me from getting into the story. Not that there is much to Conan's part of the story. Much of the film is dedicated to Stephen Lang's Kalar Zym (if his dress wasn't enough to let me view Lang as a stand-in for an '80s Clancy Brown, they went and named his character Zym) and his daughter with an Electra Complex. None of it is interesting – not in terms of plot or action. Rachel Nichols appears to be in a completely different movie – and I am just going to assume there was a body double for a certain scene so that it remains like she isn't really in the movie – her character a maguffin and a foil to show that Conan isn't just a murderous, brooding thug.There will be people who will really like this movie. I guess, like with the relaunch of Star Trek (2009), it helps to not have much vested in the canon of the characters and their universe. However, I didn't think there was much in the way of fun to be had with this Conan the Barbarian. Nispel stretched scenes longer than they need to be, and adopts a Peter Jackson approach – from King Kong (2005) – if some is good, the more is more, and much more must then, finally, be better. It didn't work then, and it doesn't now. This is how Conan should look, so kudos for that.Jason Momoa occasionally looks very much like Conan (more than Schwarzenegger ever did), and he may evolve into a pretty good action star. He isn't what is wrong with the movie. Treating Picts as though they are some type of human-goblin hybrid is what's wrong with it. Not finding a proper balance between cartoonish, camp, and gritty action is what's wrong with it. And not trimming about 15 minutes worth of filler because somebody thought the filler looked good is what's wrong with it.If I were unfamiliar with the original Conan the Barbarian (1982), I might view this as a C+ effort. Compared to Kull the Conqueror (1997), I would rate it a B-. But when viewed in the entirety of Howard's (and various other authors) material and how well it had been handled in the past, I have to put this at the C/C- level. I didn't enjoy it, and there were parts that really grated on me (like having a second expository voice over to start the second act), but I can't view it as a disaster. This is one I think most viewers can wait for on DVD/Blu-ray or to come to premium cable.",Conan the Barbarian
190,fran-rhowbotham,Very disappointing,2,9 July 2019,"Shockingly bad film. Almost as if made by a first year film student. No finesse or tension, just wham bam. Not a patch on the not brilliant but more charismatic Arnie version. Sorry...",Conan the Barbarian
191,d-kampen,Just swinging his sword.,4,4 August 2016,"Conan the Barbarian is a really basic action/fantasy movie, and with really basic I mean really basic.The movie begins with short introduction to the world (voiced by the great Morgan Freeman)and after that an introduction to the main character Conan, the story really begins when a bad guy kills Conan's family in search for a magic artifact which will give him great power, Conan survives and goes on a revenge quest. The bad guy gives Conan some time to grow up and then finds the last thing he needs for his ritual, a woman with some special old blood. Conan and this girl meet each other and of course the fall in love. But happiness doesn't last long and the girl get's captured by the bad guy so Conan needs to go and rescue her. He of course succeeds to rescue here kill the bad guy and escape. And that's it.The movie itself was structured like a simple video-game, intro-walking-boss level-walking-boss level-etc-etc-final boss level(the last two boss levels even took place in a video-game like environment).But unlike the protagonist in a video-game Conan is invincible, there were dozens of times where he could've been easily killed but for some reason he just didn't The characters all came straight from the cookie-cutter, none off them had any depth and there wasn't any character development either. So because of this the characters were boring and this made the movie boring.Another minor thing that let this movie down where it's special effects they looked bad, especially in some of the fight-scenes.So overall this was a bad movie about a guy who liked swinging his sword, with bad structuring, boring characters and a way to basic plot. I would give this movie a 4,3/10",Conan the Barbarian
192,punisher5150,Not Arnold's Conan!,6,28 August 2011,"This Conan is different. The movie itself will ultimately be compared to the 80s version. How does it stand? They are very different entities. However does that make it bad? No it does not. Jason Momoa captures Robert E Howard's Conan pretty well! There will be some nitpicking (no blue eyes, straight black hair, etc), but his Conan was savage and could be brutal. I was disappointed with the revenge storyline (Arnold's movie did that better), but the rest of the movie was a great set of action pieces. The Hyborian Age was depicted much closer to REH's description than the 80s movie. The villain was good, the villainess (daughter of the villain) was interesting. Ironically the villain's motivation was to resurrect the with-queen of Acheron to become immortal, which was a plot of the previous Kull the Conqueror movie from 1997. There was some weakness with the plot itself and directing by Marcus Nispel. He is no John Milius. But the movie entertained and there was glimmer of what could be an awesome cinematic interpretation of REH's character if the franchise is allowed to continue. My biggest complaint is the soundtrack. One thing Arnold's Conan movie had was the best barbaric fantasy soundtrack any movie could ever muster. When Millennium bought the rights to the franchise, they should have gotten Basil Polidouris's thundering music to boot. If you're a fan of sword/sorcery and fantasy, don't pass this one up just because you have fond memories of the 80s Conan. This film is better than the second movie in that series and other REH adaptations (except possibly Solomon Kane, which needs to get some kind of U.S. release!)",Conan the Barbarian
193,janhalcion,Garbage,1,17 March 2021,"Even the original was better than this and that's saying something. Jason Momoa is highly overrated, as his performance in this movie highlights. He's like Arnold Schwarzenegger light, if that can be a thing. Say what you want about schwarzenegger, he had personality and prescence. The director should stick to music videos, because any feature film that he touches turns into garbage. Honestly, its like a teenage boy directed this thing.
Other than that, this is a badly written badly acted badly directed movie that should have had much more talented people attached to its making if the producers wanted to start a franchise with it. Generic bad guy who gets what he wants at the very beginning of the movie and then hardly does anything with it for some reason. This is just a lazily made movie, a cash grab with no real inspiration behind it. A lot of people just collecting paycheques.",Conan the Barbarian
194,stormphire1,very very underrated action movie,7,6 January 2012,"Alright this movie isn't nearly as bad as everyone is making it out to be. Its CONAN I mean seriously what were you expecting. It has everything a Conan movie needs. It has Conan, it has boobs, it has a smoking hot chick for him to save, (rachel nichols) it has a smoking hot villain (rose hot ass mcgowan). Did I mention boobs?!?! Oh yea I did! OK so the story isn't EPIC it ain't Lord of the Rings people its Conan! Aside from him being able to break chains with naught but a casual swipe of his sword its what an action fantasy movie should be. I feel like I got my 9 bucks worth. An action movie is supposed to entertain and this movie never failed to do that from the first scene to the last! However 70 million dollar budget to remake Conan... Hollywood.. Follywood is more like it.. yall didn't really think this would do THAT well... did ya? omg... you did!...SMH!!..better luck next time!",Conan the Barbarian
195,davecalhoun-2,watch it when you have nothing else to watch,4,6 June 2012,I was pretty disappointed in this movie. Jason Momoa gave a very uninspiring performance. Most of the time it seemed like he just wasn't into his own movie. Not nearly enough attitude like a barbarian should have. Rachel Nichols? Did she even know what movie she was in? Acting like a new yorker in conan movie isn't the way to go. So there's the bad stuff.The good news is there is a lot of fight scenes (even if they aren't all great). There was one good actor in the movie. Rose McGowan really brought personality and character to her role. Besides Rose the only thing that made the movie interesting was the topless girls.,Conan the Barbarian
196,smokecombs,"Less Musclular, More Athletic Conan=Pretty Good Movie.",10,22 August 2011,"As one of the biggest Conan fanatics on the planet it's very hard for me to be subjective...so I won't. But I, as a Conan ""nerd"" can, in my opinion give a fairly accurate opinion on how Conan SHOULD be.From the very beginning of the movie I already knew this was going to blow that God awful ""Pathfinder"" movie out of the water. I know the creators of this new Conan were also responsible for that horrendous movie so that already had me worried. Luckily my fears were alleiviated within 2 minutes of the movie. My wife was in tears within the first 3 or 4 minutes which surely means that there was a pretty powerful something to this movie, to start out and without giving away any spoilers, so.Then, to me, it just got better. Maybe it was a little over the top with the young Conan stuff (obviously), but remember, this IS Conan! As for my hopes of the movie possibly being an actual Robert E. Howard story, I don't think it was that. I don't recall this particular story anyways and I've read at least 4 dozen of them plus all the comics. So, my one criticism for the original with Arnold was also in this movie, but still, I consider both movies great in their genre.Let me get to why I actually may like the movie more than a lot here. A lot of the reviewers, IMO, have not yet watched this movie and reviewed anyway, and also a lot of reviewers really have that first Conan movie with Arnold ingrained in their mind as the measuring stick. I am going more by the books which were written several decades before the original Conan even came out (which was not written by the original and by far the best Conan writer/creator, Robert E. Howard) and also the comics.Conan was/is supposed to be a big man, tall and imposing but as agile as a cat and feline fast. Arnold was fairly tall and imposing, but he lacked the most important thing, speed and athleticism. He brought a fairly powerful stage presence and decent acting but Arnold was all power, not a whole lot of speed and agility going on in the fight scenes. So in this way, Momoa was much better for the part, or modern special effects and fighting choreography made a much better representation of how Conan is supposed to look in battle. Momoa even has the right hair color! Lol, although a little curly (Conan is supposed to have straight black hair, but oh well...) I will just break it down like this, sort of a vs. thing of different aspects of the movies, the original vs. this new one. One thing the original had was a GREAT musical score that this new one can't hold a candle to at all. But anyway, here goes.Acting (lead actor): Arnold (by a slim margin, Momoa acts as well, just not the stage presence of Arnie) Fighting Scenes: Momoa (A much better representation of Conan's SKILL and speed were on display) Gore Factor: Conan 2011 (THis movie by far exceeds the blood and dismemberment of the original) Story: Tie(Neither were original Robert E. HOward stories but I believe there were good elements to both stories) Character Development: Original (I think we missed out on a good bit of character development for Conan in this new one, especially from teenage years to adult) Music: Original (Landslide win for the original which just had some music that wanted you to go sword fight your neighbor just for the heck of it) Setting/Scenery: Conan 2011 (close here, the original has some scenes where I just love the setting but there is a lot of desert in it too. The new one has what I think is a fairly good representation of Cimmeria. I really liked all the Picts represented in this new one as well) Overall: Conan 2011 (I can't help it, I'm a pretty big fan of this movie after just watching it this weekend. From the over the top total B.A., 12 year old Conan to the rude swaggering adult version, this was what Conan was supposed to be like and a much better movie than I had anticipated.)",Conan the Barbarian

198,carlkevad,"Confusing, disturbing.",3,20 August 2011,"Anyone who is a fan of the original ""Conan the Barbarian"" with Arnold Schwarzenegger, will most likely be disappointed by the new, totally unnecessary 3D version.""Conan the Barbarian"" stars Jason Momoa of ""Stargate"" and ""Game of Thrones"" fame, as the title character Conan.The movie opens with an introduction of the film's mythical world, as tradition with sword-and-sorcery films. I didn't see the movie in English. I saw it at an Italian theater where they dub films. I understood the dialogue, worry not. So I have no idea how the Morgan Freeman-narrated introduction sounds. Probably all epic and stuff.After the introduction, we cut to a very gory battle where a woman gives birth to Conan. She dies in childbirth, and her husband, Corin, will raise Conan by himself.Then we see Conan as a teenager. His father gets killed, kinda, by some evil sorcerer-dude (Stephen Lang), and he swears to avenge his father.Then, as an adult, he is a dirty, smelly, strong barbarian, who still hasn't got around to killing Stephen Lang, who has now found all the pieces of some evil snake-helmet that is supposed to revive his wife, but one ingredient is missing — the blood of Tamara, played by Rachel Nichols.So he sets his daughter, a very creepy-looking Rose McGowan, to track down the girl with the blood. She succeeds in finding her, but Conan soon rescues her after a string of confusing action sequences. And, of course, they fall in love, because Conan is a strong man, and Tamara is a beautiful woman.Then they set out to kill the sorcerer, whose name I now recall, Khalar Zym. There are all kinds of unmemorable names here like Ela-Shan and Fassir, etc.The main problem with ""Conan the Barbarian"" is the title character himself. I mean, how am I supposed to rout for someone who just kills a lot of people. Granted, bad people, but nevertheless. He is smelly, ridiculously strong, inexplicable agile, and just downright silly.The original Arnold Schwarzenegger character was pretty much the same, but Arnold's wooden acting was better, plus he's just fun to look at and hear, than Jason Momoa's, which I wouldn't even call acting. In fact, I'd rather go with ""extended stunt-work.""The other problems include its running time, almost two hours, which I wouldn't normally mind, but this is just a bad movie; its never ending string of confusing action sequences that don't tie the remains of a plot together; disturbingly much gore; average 3D; and just horrid acting from everyone around. Except maybe for Ron Perlman.Actually, I wouldn't call it good acting, but Ron Perlman is the best part of this movie. Maybe it's just me, but I love seeing Ron Perlman saying or doing pretty much anything. Whether he's dropping knifes at people (Alien Resurrection) or smoking a cigar and delivering clunky lines while completely red and grown horns (Hellboy), or just killing people and pouring lava on himself (here).But he's only in it for 20 minutes tops. And the running time is 112 minutes. So that is about 18% of the movie. 18% of the movie is fun. The rest, is confusing, unnecessary, and did I mention? Boring! It's boring! I usually tend to enjoy a cheesy action flick, but ""Conan the Barbarian"" bored me a lot.Exclude all those bad things I said, a devoted sword-and-sorcery fan might enjoy ""Conan the Barbarian."" Just to make it clear, it isn't horrible. It's just plain bad. I'd recommend it to fans of sword-and- sorcery movies only. Not to fans of the original movies, nor to fans of the Robert E. Howard-created character himself.If you want a good sword-and-sorcery movie, watch ""Clash of the Titans,"" and don't try to tell me it's bad, it is not bad. If you want a good Robert E. Howard-created character movie, then watch either the original ""Conan the Barbarian,"" its sequel ""Conan the Destroyer,"" or my personal favorite, ""Solomon Kane.""Rating: ★½ (3.75/10)Please support my site (carlkevad.wordpress.com) by commenting on all the reviews.

Prince of Persia - fight with ""sand"" army. Pirates of the Caribbean Sea - I was only missing: 1) Parrot 2) Elisabeth 3) Rum.

203,paridonian,Not Suprisesed in the LEAST,2,20 August 2011,"Okay so From the get go I will say I am a fan of the ARNIE Film, I grew up watching it and have felt it was one of the better movies made of any time I think. I know a lot of people in disagreement but that is an argument for another day. so here is my review of this Conan Acting - Jason Momoa - I did not agree with his casting in the first place, because Conan is WHITE Nordic Barbarian type, hes not Hawaiian, Physically I think Jason Momoa was perfect build and size, Heritage wise, Completely wrong, I understand that the books describe conan as being bronzed or Tanned, but there is a STRONG difference between being Brown Skinned and Bronzed by the sun, I don't know about you but I can tell the difference - Also, and it just might be me, but WHY the BATMAN voice, your large barbarian wielding a Big damned sword, I don't think you need to make your Voice that much deeper to sound scary.Everyone Else, I ... I am gonna assume it was just bad Directing from a Horrible Director with VERY little experience or only shoots what he things is Great and not what everyone else will hope for.Music - I was given insight by a friend who agrees that the Arnie version is better but HE liked this one too, and after a disscussion, he brought me to this point, that the Music Scores had a lot to do with the emotion and theme of scenes and they were DEAD ON in that film, this seemed to just go along with the Heavy metal hes swinging a sword SCORPION KING type of theme which falls short. so it suckedI am new to writing reviews and I hope someone will give me some Pointers on how to do it properly and more accurately and what else to touch down on, but Keep in mind, I've never taken a class for this and I am just a BIG FAN OF MOVIES and an AVID movie goer if I think its worth while I'll see it, if not, it was probably gonna suck anyways LOL, so hit me up I hope to hear from you, I might add more to this, but in my opinion this was a VERY Poor attempt to recapture something that was Pure and Perfect, with a weak they'll see what they make them see kind of thought put behind it.",Conan the Barbarian
204,radoscvetic,Was that Conan?,3,7 November 2011,"The first series created good characters, and epic action scenes for that time. Honestly watching this movie I had certain expectation and hopes that this will be something similar boosted with good CGI! Boy, was I wrong!First of all, I am not sure why the youth of Conan has been completely rewritten. Not to mention the poor result of it. I was really disappointed with that bold intention of the movie that failed to materialize properly. Dynamics of the action scenes is poorly executed and what is presented to the viewers is just a guy wielding a sword and hitting what ever is in his way without a concrete purpose. Conan does not look like a fierce and merciless warrior. He is presented as an overly righteous and a good boy. Script has many flaws that I don't know where to begin. Some scenes just made me laugh! i.e. first encounter with the evil king (forgot his name) where he actually comes alone with his daughter to get the pure-blooded from Conan. Also when pure-blooded is sent to give the map to Conan that he somehow managed to leave behind. Random and unnecessary scene of a ship invasion by the evil king forces and so on. CGI was sad. The monster scene consisted of Conan ducking the tentacles not moving an inch. Fog rather seemed as an ice cream. When movie ended I was glad it was over.

But slowly I realized that it was actually not that bad. The plot is not very strong, and there are numerous other flaws in the movie, but still it is enjoyable. At least it is comparable to Prince of Persia: The Sands of Time. Although the camera work is not very great at some points, still some of the action sequences are pretty thrilling.The movie relies on a lot of CGI but that's how Fantasy movies are made these days.

209,jillsomeone,Generic action flick,3,17 October 2021,"I've never read the Robert E. Howard fantasy stories. I'd seen the original 1982 Conan the Barbarian film, but it's been may years and memories of it were faint.I generally like fantasy and science fiction, having read many of the classics and enjoyed their movie adaptations no matter how far they strayed from the novels.So my partner and I tucked ourselves into a blanket and watched the 2011 Conan the Barbarian reboot. We were completely unprepared for how awful this film is.First, everything is over the top. A battleground C-section (done without looking! As one other reviewer mentions). A kid who can take on a gang of thugs and return with their heads. A witch who likes to taste the blood of young women. A realistic skull-shaped mountain which crumbles during a finale which includes nonsensical earthquakes/explosions. The villain could have walked out of any stereotypical bad guy factory, and the female lead character served only as a stereotypical hostage/love interest.Most of the dialogue - that sounded like it should carry some weight - was delivered as if the characters were having a casual conversation.The cinematography was jittery and jumped from one action scene to the next. I can't really comment on the soundtrack, because it was either absent or did nothing to enhance the viewing experience.The little narration there was at the beginning added nothing to the film, and I wonder why they bothered.I caught myself staring at my phone and the clock many times - there just wasn't enough there to hold my attention.I was under the impression that the 1982 Conan the Barbarian was a schlocky 80's film. Regardless, the partner and I watched that the following evening. We were both completely taken aback at how good THAT film was (especially in comparison to this one). Amazing cinematography. Dialogue delivered with appropriate gravitas. The soundtrack was absolutely incredible. Narration was consistent throughout the film. Strong female lead.I literally could not look away, despite the odd cheesy moment - due to the delivery of the entire film.If there's one good thing about the 2011 Conan reboot, it's that I am now a fan... of the 1982 original film... and might read one or two of Robert E Howard's books.",Conan the Barbarian

211,mythago,By Crom!,8,20 August 2011,"Look: it's a mindless, fun, brawny adventure flick. It's not directed by Merchant Ivory. It has a location set at Skull Cave, for crying out loud. If you're looking for a fun sword-and-sorcery movie with likable heroes, evil villains and a basic but serviceable plot, this is it. The acting is fine for the limited range the characters get, with the exception of Rose McGowan, who does an amazing job with Marique. Khalar Zym is a villain who is actually believable as a threat and not simple a hand-wringing evil overlord. And if you're looking for eye candy, there's something for everyone.The opening background sequence with Conan as a young boy is particularly well-done and really sets the character. Nobody's going to be able to really transpose Howard's two-fisted adventure prose to the screen, but the film does more than a half-decent job of capturing the flavor of the setting and the broad, simple lines of the characters. Well worth a Saturday matinée or a DVD at a party.",Conan the Barbarian
212,PureGore,A Rompin' Good Time,9,20 August 2011,"First and foremost, this movie is not for movie critics. This movie is for people looking to watch a film with an open mind and have a good time doing it. In these days of Michael Bay pseudo-epics being released every other week, it was great to sit down, turn off my brain, and enjoy a Conan movie that follows in the true tradition of Conan stories.This movie is also for true Conan fans. Lots of violent battles, blood everywhere, a dark arch-nemesis, nude women, rowdy yet loyal friends, Conan ""getting some"" with the main heroine... if you've ever read one of the Robert E. Howard or Robert Jordan (or any other author in between) Conan stories, you know exactly what to expect in this movie. The typical Conan adventure recipe is being followed faithfully, and in a very good way.Jason Momoa is a FANTASTIC Conan. He's got the moves, the attitude and the stoic presence that I've always imagined when reading the stories. The action sequences really play to his strengths, and he takes full advantage of them.Of course there's plenty of clichés throughout the movie, but that's to be expected from a Conan story. The novels are full of them too. There's also a few moments of cheesy visual effects that don't work too well. But it's easy to forget these and get pulled into the next well-scripted battle sequence.By far the lowest point of the entire movie was the ""evil daughter"" Marique, played by Rose McGowan. That's about the worst performance I've seen on the big screen in decades. Either the character was terribly scripted, or Rose McGowan was a terrible casting decision. She's worse than a parody, she's an embarrassment to the movie. Scenes where she's trying to exude an aura of evil are laughable (seriously, I almost burst out laughing when she was on screen trying to be ominous).Don't let the artsy fartsy movie critics dissuade you. If you know what to expect, or if you're a fan of Conan stories, this movie is definitely worth the price of admission.

It was a Conan movie made by people who have never seen a Conan movie or TV show, or read one of the numerous Conan novels or comic books. It's like someone described them, generally, to the filmmakers instead. Conan says ""Crom"" exactly zero times in the film. Cimmeria looks like Hobbiton, and the ""barbarians"" there have a metallurgy industry that would have shamed the 18th century. Jason Momoa, Conan here, can play an excellent barbarian, I've seen him do it in Game of Thrones. Rachel Nichols is good in everything she's in... why oh why does she only appear in garbage? Please, some director who isn't completely awful, give this woman a role! Why was Rose McGowan, not an ugly woman, IMHO, turned into a hideous freak here? Why not just hire a hideous freak? Stephen Lang can be an effective baddie when a not completely incompetent director like James Cameron is calling the shots. Crom! And why did adult Conan, in his first scene, free those slaves? Was he a Hyborean Age anti-slavery crusader or something? The scene baffled me. He didn't even rob anybody! It would have taken 2 seconds to explain that a friend of his or a girl he liked was captive there, but no. Conan's just a good 'ol 21st century hero here! Oh! And Morgan Freedman as narrator? What on earth were these people thinking? Yes, when I hear Mr. Freedman's honey-soft southern accent, I think of the Hyborean Age, whither came Conan. Was he hired as some sort of meta joke? They should show this film in film schools as an example of a film where every single thing, every single shot, is done wrong.And Maestro Bates, who did the music, what the hell? Is he somebody's cousin or something? And Jason Momoa kills a guy with molten metal... again! Who'd have believed that that kind of thing can happen to the same guy twice? (Sort of, you know what I mean. If you've seen it, that is.) And thanks for all the little homages to the real Conan movie (Conan the Barbarian, 1982, starring Arnold Schwarzenegger, directed by John Milius. I love this film.). Being reminded of how similar scenes can work when the filmmakers aren't complete morons improved the film so much for me! Gosh darn that Arnold was good! Wish he was here! That Milius guy sure could film a battle! Was he busy or something? (checks IMDb...) No.At least it had lots of blood and lots of naked chicks running around, like a Conan movie should (making this, improbably, a better film than Conan the Destroyer). But even that was done wrong. Rachel Nichols shows the world her lovely lady nickels, but the troglodyte filming this thing films them in such a way that it looked like they were using a body double! Body Double, by Brian dePalma, is an excellent film, BTW. Was Brian busy? (checks IMDb...) No. Apparently they spent 90 million dollars on this failure. Not a mere fiasco, no, a failure. This is the biggest waste of money since the Iraq war. You know what would have been a better film? They could have made a stack of 90 million dollars they spent on this abortion, in 20 dollar bills, and set it on fire. In front of this burning stack you could have had Rachel Nichols read the script for the atrocity that is Conan the Barbarian (2011) while Jason Momoa ran around said pyre in a loincloth, waving a sword and shouting ""Crom!"" occasionally. And every time something incredibly stupid happened in the script, Rachel would remove an article of clothing. She'd be naked within 30 minutes. I would watch the heck out of this movie. Oh! And, at the end, Marcus Nispel, Danny Dimbort (his real name? Sorry!), George Furla, Eda Kowan, Trevor Short, and Henry Winterstern, the director and producers of the unfortunately real Conan the Barbarian (2011), would be driven forth in chains and murdered by Jason Momoa with molten lead. Hurray! The hopelessly inappropriate soundtrack would still be done by Tyler Bates, but right at the very end, as a stinger maybe, he would be murdered by the axe-wielding ghost of Basil Poledouris.In summary, I did not like this film.Please, Arnold and John, make King Conan! You're not busy and the world needs it!",Conan the Barbarian
214,nilstimm-27018,Good Fantasy Movie,10,26 April 2020,"First, i love the 80's Movie's with Arnold and they are part of my Childhood.
I also Realy enjoyed this Movie, because of the cast, they've chosen very well.
The Set is also good and nicely done.
Story is okay, because of it isn't Shakespeare 😉
Finaly: Very good movie for a nice action-packed fantasy evening",Conan the Barbarian
215,anders-rapp,An exercise in misogyny,1,24 April 2013,"Some would say this movie is not about role models. It's about action and having fun. Maybe they're right. But the movie- or TV screen is very similar to a mirror. And every movie character is a potential reflection of who we are or who we ought to be. I'm not suggesting people will start wielding swords after watching this movie. The effect is simply psychological.So what does this movie have to offer? It represents the cave man ideal. Conan is one of the good guys so he doesn't hurt any of the women. But he says things like ""Quiet woman!"" - the male target audience smiles and winks at each other. He also drags them along by force to serve his own purpose. After he says ""I live, I love and I slay"" the female lead character inexplicably falls in love and gives her body to him??? We learn that men should act this way and women should give themselves to men who act like this. Granted, the female lead character is somewhat skilled and not entirely passive. But she is willingly dominated by violent men by whom she ultimately must be saved.There is another ""strong"" female character. She is the villains witch daughter and she's highly skilled. Too bad her skills only serve to fulfill the wishes of the patriarch. Also, she's evil and must therefore be destroyed. These are the available reflections for the female audience! Either you are a beautiful, sexy, submissive woman who is skilled but not too skilled or you are evil and far too skilled and independent to be allowed to live. Wow!!!!Apart from one or maybe two good action scenes the script is shallow, the pacing is awkward and on most parts the acting is horrible. The only standouts are the super villain and Rose McGowan as his witch daughter. She both looks and feels evil and is the most interesting character. I think the movie should have been about her.On a final note I have to say I pity Ron Perlman. He is a fine actor but he keeps ending up in terrible movies like this. He deserves so much more. He may not have the looks of Tom Cruise but neither does Philip Seymour Hoffman who keeps landing better and better roles (and deservingly so).Avoid this movie at all cost. Instead go check out Colin Stokes TED talk on ""how movies teach manhood"".",Conan the Barbarian
216,lipanwrangler,This is Conan as he was written!!! REH fans must see!,10,20 August 2011,"First off, I ain't no REH poser. I was given my dad's copies of the books when I was little, and have read and re-read them more than any other stories or books. I know Conan like he was friend in real life. I LOVE the bastard. So, that said, let me tell you from a real fan, that this film shows you the Hyborian Age, straight up like Howard wrote it.Momoa IS Conan. He owns it. He clearly understands the character 100%, and delivered the performance to us perfectly. The dude gave me chills. I loved every second of his performance.The setting is delivered perfectly. This film shows the Hyborian Age as written, with chauvinism and slavery intact, as well as the diverse range of ethnicities and cultures. I've been waiting to see this world on film my whole life, and last night, I did. And it was great.A Few Cons: First off, the geography was jacked up, either that, or weeks and months were being glossed over in-between scenes. To get to Cimmeria from any given coastline on the map, you're talking about weeks or even months of travel. I think this is why they made up a lot of places instead of using real names from the stories, because that way they can claim everything is within a day's travel or so. So yeah, you don't really get a sense of distance from the film, as it sort of just jumps around from place to place with no in-between scenes. Secondly, the overall plot of the film was extremely generic; pretty much the same ol' fantasy film plot with a villain who needs to collect stuff to come to power. They could have used ANY of the Howard stories as a base, and the plot would have blown people away, instead of being a fantasy re-tread. Oh well. The setting and the performances and the little details were so amazing that they kept me from worrying about the hammy plot. Okay, and lastly, Conan's eyes weren't blue. I'm not sure why they weren't, because that has to be about the cheapest special effect nowadays. So yeah, not sure what the reasoning was on that, and it's kinda lame, but even though I am a huge fan and a stickler for details, I still loved the film.Final Say: As a fan, it was brilliant. If you love the stories, you will love this movie, providing you can look past the little screw-ups I mentioned. Here's hoping they get to make a second one that's even better, and truly as wildly original as Howard's stories are.",Conan the Barbarian
217,baalsaak,What did I just see,3,2 November 2012,"Being a huge fan of 1982's movie, I was lacking expectations for this movie; And after more than a year, I decide to give it a try.For starters, I have no idea why this is a R rated movie, the way I see it, it is a PG-13 at least. Then, while seeing this dull flick, I can't stop wondering why this is a big-budget movie, I mean, for television it would be O.K. but when you go to a movie theater, or get to buy the bluray disc, you expect more, much more for your money.About the movie, its definitively for kids. The action sequences are poor and superficial, the Story is so full with holes and stupid clichés that after a few laughs, they start to irritate you, and if you could stand seeing this for more than half an hour, you will go WTF is this?.So, bottom line, is this movie worth see, NO, and sadly, those are 2 hours that I wouldn't get back",Conan the Barbarian
218,jamesgillactor,Ok until the end,5,30 January 2020,"The movie was not bad, except Momoa doesn't come close to the charisma of Arnold, so it was not that interesting as a result. But the end could have saved this movie. Unfortunately, it made it worse. All stories are the stories of change. The character starts somewhere, usually at a low point, and through a journey gains wisdom and knowledge and changes for the best. He didn't really change. That was a big flaw. He could have, but they decided not. That was really unwise. Producers, if you are wondering why the movie didn't do so well, that's why.",Conan the Barbarian
219,cbeltrano,Do not compare with the Arnold Z. Movie!,8,3 January 2012,"The story is about the same character but a very different twist. I really enjoyed the movie. It's not really a remake of the Arnold movie (that I really like too). The start of the story and the plot are different. At first, I didn't wanted to rent the movie, I was afraid to taint my vision of Arnold-Conan with this one BUT no, it didn't happen. The action keep you on the edge of your chair. I like the actor who played Conan, very good looking! Overall, a good action to watch with your boyfriend, mine love it too. Movie are made to entertain us, sometimes we judge too easy and too fast a movie that reprise another one. Grab some popcorn and enjoy the show!",Conan the Barbarian
220,johnnynokeys,"An insult to Conan, & quite possibly the WORST film ever made",1,3 April 2014,"THERE MAY BE SPOILERS: I knew from the trailers that this film was going to be bad, but I really had no idea just how awfully dreadful this movie was, until I rented it on Netflix. It confirmed that my choice- not to see this film in theaters, was a wise one. Let's see, WHERE to begin...To sum it up in a sentence... painfully BAD acting, terrible writing, awful casting, a weak story, forgettable characters, cheezy(not the good cheeze either) lines, horrible screenplay- you name it, this film's got it. Even Morgan Freeman doing the opening narration was a laughable mistake. It made me realize that Mako(the narrator in the original) left a lot to live up to. There was no feeling or heart in it. I half expected Freeman to finish with: ""...and that was the day I met Andy Dufresne."" That is where the chuckles began. (And I LIKE Morgan Freeman). The opening scenes of ""Conan"" being born and him as a kid... do nothing to build his character, just fuels the ridiculousness and would have been better left out. He comes across as a smart-ass little runt.It seems that they were trying SO hard to make ""Conan"" appear tough (and they fail- he ends up coming across as completely unsympathetic and a d*ck), whereas the original made you love the character of Conan and his power and mettle were something of awe- which the original film pulled off effortlessly. Jason Momoa is such a bad ""Conan"" it's hard to watch most of the time. What were they thinking at the casting call? Makes you wonder whether the writers were familiar with ANY of Robert E. Howard's writings OR ANY of the original films. The villains in this film are not menacing or ominous at all, Rose McGowan's character had potential, but they didn't give her much to work with- except bad lines. The main villain is almost laughable. Horribly acted with bad costumes to match. In fact by the end of the film, I had a hard time holding back laughing out loud. His last line to ""Conan"": ""I don't like you anymore!"" had me in tears, my ribs hurt from laughing so hard.The boring plot, paired with forgettable/annoying characters and cheap, poorly done FX/ bad CGI (especially on the blood) leave you almost falling asleep. The only thing that kept me awake was the anticipation of another awfully delivered, terribly written line. I picked this DVD up from the $1.00 bin to add to the ""Worst Movies Ever Made"" part of my DVD collection. I know I paid 0.85 cents too much, but laughs this good, don't come cheap. To add ""insult to injury,"" now every time I talk about Conan the Barbarian... I have to say: ""No, not the sh*tty remake... the good one, with Arnold.""",Conan the Barbarian
221,gandalf321,One close in mindless action scene follows,1,4 October 2019,"How brainless can a movie get? This move seems like one mindless close-in action scene following another. Not even epic action scenes. If you're look for story, fantasy world creation, interesting characters, good dialog, etc for the components of good movie -- they're not here.I was playing the video game Conan Unconquered (a fun co-op survival RTS tower defense game) so I wanted to see the move.Not even interesting, epic action scences like Lord of the Rings. Just close-in camera on fighting and gore.I couldn't stand to watch this movie to the end, even with low expectations.

222,debbie-122-54138,Meh,3,20 October 2021,"I am a massive fan of the Conan books and the original films with Arnold Schwarzenegger. This is not a patch on them. I've read on here that it was supposed to be closer to the original storyline but it's very weak.The film: I love Morgan Freeman but I don't know why they spent a chunk of money getting him to narrate the beginning. The storyline started off a bit weird with Conan being pulled from his mother as she died,then was strong around Conan growing up (although I very much doubt he could have taken out the five raiding party guys), and was weak with him as an adult. The only saving grace was the storyline of Khalar Zym searching for the mask and the pure blood descendent to bring his wife back, which wasn't supposed to be the main purpose of the film. The ease of killing someone and the blood splatter was totally over the top, although I appreciate this was done to add to the 'ambience'. Conan had no really serious fights until Marique conjured up the sand men but the only reason he struggled was because she threw the poisoned knife at him.The acting: The lad who played Conan as a child nailed it. Ron Perlman was wasted. I don't know what race the raiding party guys were (ie the ones young Conan killed) but their makeup was fantastic. I didn't know adult Conan was played by Jason Momoa until I looked up the cast - I've only ever seen photos of him with a beard and never seen any of his films - his smouldering eyes in this are the only thing going for him but I don't think that's a fault of his acting ability. I wouldn't class Ukafa as a sidekick (which Conan always has) or of any particular use that I could tell and I could hardly understand him. Stephen Lang who played Khalar Zym was amazing with what he had, as was Rose McGowan who played Marique, although it was weird and creepy when she started 'coming on' to her father. Tamara was a strong character most of the time - until the storyline called for her to be weak, which spoilt it. Couldn't understand Ela-Shan (the thief).Overall, I won't be watching it again. I'm not surprised it bombed at the cinema and they didn't make a sequel.",Conan the Barbarian
223,Averus_19,Worthless remake and a huge waste of time,2,3 December 2011,"Let me make this short and sweet.This was a summer filled with pointless sequels and remakes, Conan the barbarian was just another one of them. A remake to the 1982 film starring Arnold Schwarzenegger as Conan this film barley gets close to the charms and quality set up by its predecessor. The film follows Conan from his childhood where he sees his father murdered in front of his eyes and grows up to seek revenge on the men who did it.Yes this is your typical action movie plot only set up in a mythical land. The movie does start off well-paced with adequate time to set up Conan's childhood and story but after the father is murdered the movie takes a huge downfall. The new Conan (Jason Momoa) growls his dialogue throughout and never has anything important to say, while the rest of the cast cannot pull off even a half decent performance with the villains coming off as corny and plain dumb while the story and mythology gets badly jumbled and the choppy editing lacks any continuity to the action taking place.The next hour goes by with sword clashing and blood spilling and nothing much else. The action looks big but feels redundant and small while there is only so many times you can see somebody getting stabbed or beheaded. Yet the score is quite good and some scenes are nicely done but really nothing special.By the end of it, the film and story seems like a long boring video game but only you don't have the controller.",Conan the Barbarian
224,evgeni_85,Bad on 3D good on DVD,6,18 April 2012,"Launching this film on 3D was it's biggest mistake. The 3D is poorly made, it just makes the film dark and gloomy. From what I read this is the main reason the movie is getting so many poor reviews. Renting it on DVD however would prove a much better choice. The visuals and the fight scenes are decently done (except for some parts). The script isn't original, but I wouldn't expect more from a mainstream movie in this genre. The fighting is what this movie is all about - it's brutal and it doesn't stop until the end.

225,hyteck9,Best party comedy of the Year! Go see it!,10,19 August 2011,"Seriously... Go see it, preferably with a large group of friends with a great sense of humor. The opening scene involving the world's fastest C-section and a Hasbro Wet and Wiggle doll covered in blobs of red Jell-O and Vaseline lets you know right from the beginning that you are in for a real treat. The Father holds the fake doll over his head and screams while surrounded by dozens of enemy warriors, and through what can only be described as rather amazing luck, he doesn't get slain in the process. Not to worry though, that sub-par IQ eventually overpowers lady luck and he dumps molten steel on his own face rather than any number of obvious and less terminal options. Then there is his son. Dead Father or no, this kid has issues. If he didn't end up killing everything trying to avenge his Father's death, he surely would have been just as violent and twisted, likely wearing fresh kitten pelts on his face dancing around in women's armor. The stupidity of the heroes is only surpassed by the moronic eccentricities of the villeins. The goth- dressed witch of an evil daughter is aching with desires of incest as she runs around with press- on nails made by Black and Decker... and the evil father is apparently so afraid of flash floods, he has a team of elephants drag his pirate ship all over the desert on their backs. Let me repeat that, ""he has a team of elephants drag his pirate ship all over the desert ON THEIR BACKS."" (as if any other form of RV is unacceptable) ...then he decides his ship is better served as a battering ram and breaks down a stone wall with it? I don't want to spoil everything now... but just know that this movie fails to successfully pull off every cliché in the book, including a ""collapsing evil layer"" that looks more like ""planned pushing over just the walls that the actors get near"" evil layer, and a climactic fight scene that takes place with the girl bound underfoot (overfoot? spinning around everyone's feet?) that is so confusing I have given up trying to explain it to people. Oh, and sand warriors that fly out of the sand and break apart when they fall on ... (wait for it.. ) sand! Just go see it. It is a riot.",Conan the Barbarian
226,upstreamtuna,"Not as bad as everyone says it is, but that doesn't mean it's not bad.",5,22 August 2011,"Let state a few things before I start saying things about this movie. 1: I have not read any of the books. 2: I am a big fan of the original 1982 film.Both of those being said, I can start talking about this movie.It starts off alright, with a voice over from Morgan Freeman (if they put that name drop in there, I'm sure this movie would have been more successful) telling us the background of the world we are about to enter.Now the first scene, is the scene that confused my emotions so bad that I actually almost thought this movie would be awesome. This scene is when Ron Perlman guts his wife and pulls out there son so she can see him before she dies from a wound obtained in battle. She names him Conan, and then does one of those cheesy ""turn your head to the side and stick your tongue out when you die"" moves. And then Ron Perlman holds up the most atrocious looking CGI/animatronic (I'm sure it was more CGI though) babies I have ever seen. This made me laugh SO hard. And I thought if they kept pulling cheesy stuff like that out their asses, this movie could actually be a fun time. We get more fun, as Conan is a little more grown up, and is now a young boy. Our first action scene is Young Conan fighting off growling wild- men. After that was over all I could say was, ""BADASS!""Soon after, Perlman is training Conan to fight, and we see that Conan is not yet ready. He storms off into the woods throwing a temper tantrum, and hears the sound of horses hooves. This is the evil, Khalar Zym. He invades Conan's village, looking for the last piece of a magical headpiece. He kills everyone as far as we know, except for Conan and his father. Khalar ties Perlman to a bucket of lava hanging from the ceiling, Perlman is chained to said bucket, and if he moves he dies. Khalar's daughter finds the last piece to the mask, and they storm out of the village burning the barn that Conan and his father are currently residing in. Conan is tugging desperately on the other side of the chains, to keep the fire/lava from falling on his father's head, but his father takes it upon himself to do what must be done. He pulls the bucket of scorching hot fire atop his head (kind of how Momoa killed the asshole from Game of Thrones... *wink-wink*).Nothing of much importance happens after that. We get the same-old, same-old, story line of most the straight to Sci-Fi movies. Hero: CHECK! Damsel: CHECK! Evil baddie related to hero's past: CHECK! Other baddies killed off one by one and given NO development: CHECK! Evil daughter of the main baddie: CHECK! Incomprehensibly boring action sequences: BIG CHECK!To describe what happened in the span after the first 30 minutes and before the last 30 minutes, read above. None of it is really that important.So after all the stupid stuff is over with, Conan regroups with a man that he met before, after the love interest (Tamara) is kidnapped by the main baddie, Khalar Zym. Typical. This man gets Conan into the big castle-thingy-that's-not-really-a-castle and upon arriving, we are thrust into the fun last 30 minutes (Which involves about 10 minutes of Conan fighting goons and the last lesser baddie, while trying to avoid being devoured by a huge octopus thingy, and also trying to save his ""friend"" that got him in there in the first place). After all is said and done, Conan parts ways with his ""friend"" and goes to save Tamara. He has some fun swordplay with Khalar Zym and then runs away from him. He goes to save Tamara from Rose McGowan, kills Rose McGowan, runs away from Khalar, and then confronts and kills Khalar.NOT AT ALL like the 82' version. And I'm glad they didn't try to remake that version. This one is more of a reboot.. (If you can't remember Arnold left the Conan series because he didn't want to be type-cast as the sword toting badass that he was in the Conan movies. So we got 2/3 Conan movies.. Barbarian and Destroyer, and the last one was never made.. this is most likely the reason they made the 2011 version, so they could tell the story without ruining the Arnold series).Bad acting, horrible story, and atrocious character development ruin this movie. The only good saving aspects are the lead actress Rachel Nichols, and the first and last 30 minutes... But the number one reason I don't prefer this movie, is because there is no Arnold. Not even a cameo... (which is silly, because Lionsgate distributed this film, and one of their first films ever distributed was Terminator 2. At least pay the guy who got this company off the ground his respects with a cameo!). You don't need to see this movie. Don't look for it on DVD, but if you see it on cable or HBO around this time next year, go ahead and watch it. But you really don't need to.2.5/5",Conan the Barbarian

I don't like the word ""remake"". This is a different movie. I wouldn't compare. It is as bad/good as it is. 4. Script is a bit shallow. This could make an average TV show for a couple of seasons.

229,acolu7,Conan The Terrible,1,21 August 2011,"First of all, before I say anything about the movie I want people to know a little bit about me. I went into this movie with an open mind wanting to see it anyway despite the horrid reviews it's been getting from critics. (I generally tend to ignore the critics especially for movies that I personally think will be worth seeing in theaters) the trailer looked pretty cool for this one, so I went in expecting at the least an awesome super gory action flick. What I got was the total opposite and a huge disappointment for me. The critics are right. Conan the Barbarian is overall an absolutely terrible movie.To be fair, the movie actually starts out with some promise showing us young Conan and a really brutal kick-ass action scene with young Conan in the beginning. After the beginning sequence though, the movie starts to fall apart rapidly. The dialog is extremely weak and uninspired. I kid you not, Conan probably says a maximum of forty words or less throughout the entire movie. Whoever wrote the script seemed like they just stopped trying and gave up after the promising beginning scenes.Another thing that I found really disappointing was that Conan himself was just not brutal enough. Only for short moments here and there he did some barbarian like things but not at all on the level that you'd expect from a movie titled ""Conan The Barbarian"" The action scenes themselves were just not filmed well at all. It was filmed using very fast paced cuts and it was very confusing to keep up with what was happening on screen. The camera always seemed to be lagging behind the action, and just when it finally catches up with Conan to see what he's doing, the bad guy is already dead. Great. The plot was a jumbled mess and the acting pretty much on every level, was completely horrendous. Personally I am a fan of Jason Momoa. After his performance as the savage Khal Drago on the hit show ""Game of Thrones"" I thought he would be absolutely perfect to portray Conan, but sadly he is very weak in this role and really adds nothing new or interesting to the character. One more thing to be mentioned is that the 3D in this movie is non-existent. (Yes I saw it in 3D and don't think I am bashing the movie just because the 3D was horrible) The sad truth is even if I saw the regular 2D film I would still think the same about it. It is just that bad of a movie. I dare to say that even 10,000 BC was better than this movie. (And that movie was terrible) At least in that movie you could tell what was happening during the action scenes. I strongly felt the urge to warn people not to waste their hard earned money on this movie. Trust me you will thank me for saving you the money. But, if you are dead-set on seeing it for yourself anyway despite what I have to say DO NOT see it in 3D it really is just an extra waste of money. Think ""Clash of The Titans"" not one thing in the entire film is 3D except for the ending credits. Avoid this film at all costs. 1/5",Conan the Barbarian

Whatever, the track record is disappointing: tons of potential, tons of cool ideas & visuals. He just hasn't quite been able to pull it off. For my money, Conan is the biggest disappointment of the bunch. Having read and enjoyed all the original Howard books, collected quite a few of the comics during the 70s & 80s, and even enjoyed the Arnold movies (in spite of their issues), I'm a fan/quasi-expert. That in mind, gotta say it, get your stone-throwing arms warmed up: Momoa makes a good Conan -- waaaayy better than Arnold! He could be a tad bigger to truly dominate his surroundings (several of his opponents are bigger than he in the new movie), but he nails the character. The swagger, facial expressions, grace, attitude are all right out of Howard's pages. And he doesn't cry out like he's pumping iron every time he takes a hit! Arnold was truly laughable in almost every way, more Zamoran buffoon than stoic Cimmerian. Entertaining, but no Conan. Momoa holds up his end, to the extent the script allows. (He even has the good taste to be with Lisa Bonet, post-Lenny!) My only other criticism is that Momoa went on record to say that Khal Drogo would kick Conan's ass. What are you, high??? Drogo made it (almost) through one book and an infected wound; Conan survived countless injuries worse than that one, and 12 original books. Get serious, Jason... The editing here is choppy, the plotting rushed and yet meandering, and the source material forgotten and forgettable. Please, newer fans help me out: Do the central characters and places even exist in the printed Hyborian world? Call me on my mistakes here, but I don't recall major villains named Khalar Zym or Martique, a heroine named Tamara, sidekicks named Artus or Ela-Shan, evil henchman named Akhun, Ukafa or Remo. I don't even recognize most of the place names in this flick. Am I just way out-of-date with the mythology of the comics? Or did the filmmakers really just come up with this stuff out of thin air, to make a whole new story? And if so, WHY??? There's not enough already written to choose from?? Per the featurettes, this movie drew on ""eight decades of source material"" to make the best Conan story ever. If that's so, why is it so unfamiliar to us? So disappointing to the fans? What happened to the idea of the climactic rivalry between Conan and Thoth-Amon the Stygian sorcerer (forget the laughable Toth-Amon from the second film)? A few name changes and they could've worked that angle here. What about the long lists of buddies and lovers with an actual history. What about the idea of making a classic labor of love project like LOTR, instead of pushing for yet another summer blockbuster that'll probably go bust (can you say John Carter)? Guess we may as well ask why all the Greeks in Alexander had Scottish accents, huh? Arnold vs. Momoa? Momoa. Conan vs. Sonja? Conan. Conan vs. Kull (Sorbo)? Conan. Sandahl vs. Brigitte vs. Rachel vs. Olivia? Olivia, no contest! Lang vs. Jones? Jones, but good try. McGowan vs. Carrere? Carrere, weak split decision. Barbarian vs. Destroyer? Barbarian. '82 vs. 2011? Hmmm... Visually stunning, decently performed, epic fail. Well what're you gonna do? That's Hollywood in the 21st century. Think I'll go back to reading Song of Ice & Fire... Save your money, folks..!",Conan the Barbarian
231,gimlid2002,Conan The Merciless,1,7 November 2011,"Actually,It was the writing and direction that was truly merciless. Conan was really the victim here (as well as myself and anyone with an IQ above 60 who watched the movie).Truly pathetic, this movie broke my heart as a conan fan of approximately 30 years. Of course it had everything a movie needs to succeed today: poor lighting, bad cgi, unrealistic looking fighting choreography, bad acting,chase scenes and accidents of ""A-Team"" caliber, etc....Dino Delaurentis please come back and see that the next attempt at a R E Howard movie is worthy.I actually felt very depressed by what they have done to the Conan character. Truly saddened. Gimlid",Conan the Barbarian
232,wwharton4,this might be the worst movie I've ever seen,1,5 September 2012,"So if you're reading this review you've probably seen the original Conan and you are aware of what a good movie is, which sad to say, will make it very hard to enjoy this movie. I was actually offended by how bad this movie was. I think they took an 8 year old's rough draft of a movie script and put it into production. Nothing about this movie makes any sense.In the middle of a battle, people are trying to attack a collapsed pregnant woman who is fighting them off and killing people. Now I've never personally been in the middle of a battlefield, but I would think when there are grown men looking to put a sword in me, I wouldn't worry about a collapsed pregnant woman, but what do I know? Maybe battle makes you want to go on a pregnant woman killing spree. Again I can only speculate.You will then get to see Ron Perlman deliver a C section to said woman in the middle of the battlefield. So Conan was born in the heat of battle by a woman who was a fierce warrior... OK we get it.It then goes into Conan as a child and his people who love to fight and battle for no apparent reason at all. More unthought out childish clichéd story lines.Ron Perlman then gives his lovely speech about how a warrior must be fierce and strong, so of course he then tasks the kids including young Conan to race around with an egg without breaking it. Because nothing says fierce warrior like a parenting care class given to children in school.From there you get 8 year old Conan beating the crap out of 4 or 5 grown built men who make some sort of animal sound that no human could ever make. Usually something this ridiculous would be somewhat comical but I found no humor in how bad this movie was. You have to watch a little kid made of stick and bones that weighs less than hundred pounds toss around grown men and bash a guys head open into snow flakes. Again, nothing about this movie makes any sense.It was at this point I stopped watching, note I only watched the first 5 or 10 minutes. I also skipped the clichéd main plot which was retarded. How does something like this even get made? How do you even glance at it and go, ""hey this isn't worst movie I've ever seen."" It just boggles my mind.On the plus side I watched the original Conan again and that movie is awesome. You get to see how Conan progressed into becoming a warrior, his battles, his choice between love and revenge, the feel of life in a different time, and oh the sweet battles. There was rhyme and reason for just about everything to the original Conan. Even his foes were well developed and could really make you believe.",Conan the Barbarian
233,Jamie-802-978808,"Sword and sorcery is back in its element, Conan is reborn",9,26 September 2013,"A review is what ever you want it to say, the reviews for Conan are mixed, why!!??? You ask? Well to give this film a bad review is because you have no imagination and are way too serious. This is sword and sorcery in 80's style epic proportions, I loved it it gripping and over the top from the start everything it should be with the title Conan the barbarian. The people who gave this bad reviews are either little old ladies or boring egg heads with a bug to bare.Conan starts with a child born into war, who yearns for vengeance and gratification. His journey a begins with the loss of his father and takes you into a fantasy world where anything is possible.Conan is epic Saturday evening fodder, if you are a man who loves an obvious yarn, fighting, sorcery, a nasty villain and eventually gratified revenge then this is for you. If not then rent out miss Marple............",Conan the Barbarian
234,jrgmmg-833-182068,NOT a remake - but...,5,1 November 2013,"What promoted me to write on the late evening, was all the lame idiotic posts reviewing this movie and measuring it's merits by comparing this to the old Arnold flick. First off, this is NOT a remake of Arnold's ridiculous movie from 1982, but just another failed attempt to bring this literary giant to the screen. And I say ridiculous and I'll explain. I first discovered the original Conan novels some 35 years ago. Came across a paperback novel with one of those incredible Frank Frazetta paintings on the cover and was immediately hooked. Conan quickly became one of my literary favorites and I digested every single story, including those penned by L Sprague deCamp and Bjorn Nyberg. Originally written in the early 30's by Robert E. Howard, Conan's short stories first appeared in pulp fiction magazines such as Weird Tales. Howard was part of what was known as ""The Lovecraft Circle"", (a reference to the amazing horror author H.P. Lovecraft), where the authors corresponded with each other and shared ideas. If you've ever read anything by Lovecraft, let alone Howard's Conan stories, do yourself a favor, go to Amazon, and buy yourself some books. You can buy huge volumes of Conan stories in one book now.For those who thought Arnold's and Milius's adaptation of Conan was even remotely good, you've obviously never read a Conan novel. Arnold's character in his film Commando was more like Conan than the idiotic character they wrote for him in that terrible movie. I walked out of that movie completely disgusted and disappointed. It may have been an entertaining barbarian movie, but it was NOT Conan. At least the new flick tried to adhere to some of Howard's vision of the Hyborean age and Conan's young life in Cimmeria. While I sort of enjoyed Mamoa's performance, (physically he looked pretty good but I still miss the bangs) the writers still didn't capture what made Conan such a compelling character. While certain aspects of the production also looked pretty good, much better than 1982's film, it definitely made for a better barbarian sword and sorcery flick. It just didn't come close to capturing the complex character that is Conan. His code of honor, his humor, everything that made him an absolutely terrific and original character was just totally missing....again.The point is, these 2 movies have nothing in common other than the name. You people are wasting your time arguing this point and quite frankly, irritated me to the point of making me write in my own review. Nispel's movie was NOT a remake of the '82 film and any attempts at comparison is just a waste of time. In retrospect, I guess this is what fans of Burrough's must have felt when they had to endure the pitiful and embarrassing Johnny Weissmuller performances of Tarzan from the 30's and 40's. (Not to disparage Mr. Weissmuller, I'm sure he was just reading his lines and following his direction.) If you've ever read a Tarzan novel, you know exactly what I'm saying. If not, due yourself a favor and just read the first book. You'll never say ""Me Tarzan, you Jane"" again.",Conan the Barbarian
235,alimike1995,Cannot beat the original,1,8 January 2019,"Wish I could give it 0/10...absolutely shockingly bad film...There is only 1 Conan and that is Arnie...simples.Should never have been remade, waste of money 😶😱",Conan the Barbarian

In my opinion this movie was a tryout for the Aquaman role! Momoa's ability to move well has been honed over decades (at least since Farscape!)... There were underwater fight scenes...Movie had an Aquaman feel to it almost, just with a much smaller budget... Even the sorceress wore a costume that highly resembles Aquaman's golden chest plate...
If you like fun/adventure movies in the arena of everything from Flash Gordon to The Mummy, franchise, Resident Evil, etc, then you will enjoy this... It's not Shakespeare folks... But it's a retelling of s classic that is thousands of years older than ""to be or not to be""...",Conan the Barbarian

At least that way they could have sold it as an action packed adventure for the family. Maybe they would have come close to breaking even.
For the rest of us though, all the million dollar sets and bare breasted women in the world couldn't save this film from its flat dialogue, terrible character development, overly convenient plot vehicles (master thief who just happens to have the keys to a secret passage to the fortress, anyone?), and badly overacted character stereotypes. It took the me three tries to make it through this movie and I still gave up about 20 minutes from the end.",Conan the Barbarian

Schwarzenegger has plenty more ability as an actor than Jason Momoa and delivers the movie in better than two hours of enjoyable fantasy entertainment.Does Rose Macgowan look anything like a witch? She is a capable actress but sorely wasted and who knows what Stephen Lang was thinking when he signed up for this rubbish, he is a great modern character actor who has shone in recent outings but looks ridiculous and has no presence, unlike James Earl Jones in the original who was hypnotic and easily detestable.Marcus Nispel should go back to directing KFC commercials.",Conan the Barbarian
239,njb7977,Hyborian Bliss,8,27 November 2011,"OK, look. It's a movie about a crude guy out to avenge people that were important to him. If you reduce it that far, of course it's going to sound empty and trite. Casablanca was about some people trying to get out of a city. That totally doesn't do the movie justice, but it's true.If you're looking for deep drama and eyes that are a window to a yearning woman's heart, then this isn't the movie for you. If you're looking for a summer blockbuster'd faithful rendition of a beloved fantasy book series, then you're in the right place! Conan The Barbarian 2011 delivers all the black sorcery, gratuitous cleavage, swashbuckling barfights, and tear-the-meat-off-the-bone barbarism that anyone could want who actually read the books or loved the original movies in spite of themselves.I thought the camera work was fine. Was it FANTASTIC (a la The Lord of the Rings)? No. There's a reason that movie took all sorts of awards. Did it pull you into the action, and give you an idea of where the movie took place? Yes, absolutely! Was the acting poor? NO. I thought the main character was played admirably, and the supporting cast was great! I especially liked the inclusion of a heroine who could take care of herself in a fight. Very Hyborian.Expecting a movie involving a plot such as this to be Mystic River-esque is unfair to the genre. Go forth and enjoy the movie for what it is: a brief foray into a land of high adventure, where the magic is black, the creatures are always hungry, and there is always someone out there willing to kill for the answer to the riddle of steel.",Conan the Barbarian
240,demontrace,The worst movie ever,1,16 December 2016,"This is the worst movie ever made. At best it ties with other worst movies ever made. It has none of the charm, nor spectacle of the 1982 movie. The acting is horrible. The story line is a major step down from the 1982 movies. Indeed, in every way, compared to the 1982 movie, this one is worse. How does that happen when almost 30 years have passed since the 1982 movie? Certainly Jason Momoa is no Arnold Schwarzenegger, not even at his best, versus Arnold's worst.So what is there to look forward to here? Well, nothing really. Watch the 1982 film. The 2011 film is one of the worst things I've ever seen, to the point that I couldn't even finish it. It's really that bad.",Conan the Barbarian

Leo Howard stole the show, and laid a solid foundation for a great Conan. Jason Momoa was a great choice to follow Howard, too bad the screenwriting and direction failed to utilize him to his full potential. The cgi was poorly executed and overly relied upon instead of a solid story telling. This movie felt like it was made more as a marketing tool for the video game that followed and less as a darkly brutal sword and sorcery throwback.",Conan the Barbarian

If you, like me, lived in the age of Conan and joined him on his adventures as a boy, you'll have that feeling inside how the adventures of Conan felt like. The ambiance of Conan is none existent. The photography on the other hand is quite good, and the special effects are decent. Arnold did a worse number on it, but as an avid reader of comics, i would like someone, who actually read the comics, sit in the directors chair and create Hyberia as we know it. They've done it successfully with Marvel comics.... So please give us CONAN!!!

You don't see a lot of these kind of movies anymore. So much is made with computers that it looks fake and most of todays movies don't have the blood and gore anymore which they deserve to have, which will make a movie so much better.

244,kristian_dancer,"Momoa can stay everyone else not so much. Bad story/ script from mid point,Terrible sound Track, Bad Props",5,3 September 2011,"OK, I loved the original 1982 Arnie movie. I love all Howard's books and own all he wrote and a huge seventies paper back collection of other authors.Conan is my boyhood hero.This all being said I have been urgently awaiting this release with bated breath. I have been hoping beyond hope it would live up to my hopes for Conan sadly it was not to be but there is some good.My greatest worry was about Jason Momoa proceeding the release and I have to say he was great! Now I would have to add that he could do with quite a bit more muscle and the absence of the volcanic blue eyes really ticked me off but overall he was great and I would defiantly go see him in a sequel.The beginning of the movie starts pretty well with the young Conan this is as good as it gets. Best performances have to go to Ron Pearlman and Jason Momoa.The story is so average why out of all the Conan adversaries would you choose some boring warlord. The bad guy in this type of movie needs some depth some sense of evil this one had none just another boring thug transplanted from Avatar. The script seemed to dry up completely about half way through the editing is awful huge gaps in the story from about he half way point meaning it's pretty well described up until the mid way point then nothing big jumps in story and no description or journey.My three biggest let downs have to be the music it totally sucks it so sucks as to be indescribably bad more so when you compare it to the Basil Poledorus from the original which was sublime.The props again truly awful the swords, Man made me want to cry they were so bad no detail painted black to look dirty splitting gimmicky bad guys sword with no thought for weight or balance Conan's fathers sword looked completely fake with again no sense of age of time spent in the crafting. Conan's costumes were pretty good but supporting actors were again awful looked like a Sci-fi channel production.Story and script again bad you cannot make a movie like this without enough time money and people who are passionate about the texts that have gone before it needs a sense of presence at the language has to transport you to a time an dreamed of not last Thursday somewhere near Prague.Overall there were some good choices 1.Jason Momoa 2. Ron Pearlman 3.Conan as a movie enterprise.Then there were some truly horrific ones 1. soundtrack I can not tell you how bad it is compared to the 82 Arnie version. 2. Conan is meant to have blue eyes. 3. Nispel so not ready for an undertaking like this. 4. Props maker Jody Samson is turning in his grave (he made the original Conan sword). 5. Production way way way to cheap and bad CGI. Huge boat carried by elephants how do they pick it up how would they put it down no thought gimmicky and crap.I truly hope there is a sequel and hope they fire Nispel, get a bad guy who understands heroic fantasy and is a decent character actor with presence and timber ( miss you mister James Earl Jones) Christopher Lee you know and actor !!! and that they re use the Polidorus sound track and the old Conan Atlantean sword.

245,adam-1817,Arnie could punch a hole right through this guy,1,21 January 2012,"..And I know that's not a reason for a 1 start rating, but there be plenty afoot.Imagine Conan The Barbarian, written and directed by the team being Hercules the Legendary Journeys, only without the ""tongue in cheek"" brilliantness, and the captivating charisma of the marvellous Kevin Sorbo. Cast a talentless, long haired nobody who's been working far too much on his chest, and not enough on not being a terrible actor....and not looking like a slighted juiced Brendan Fraser.Throw in a stunningly made up, beautifully mascaraed ""monk"" girl, who just happens to be able to cut down professional warriors at the drop of a hat, with a broadsword that must have weighed twice as much as her perfect little frame. A sword that I presume was made of out helium, as it was menacingly waved about by a ten year old Conan earlier.Queue some thoroughly uninspiring sidekicks, plenty of bouncy foam rocks, balsa wood walls/floors/furniture. ""Epic"" battles, that involve a lot of needless splatter, some incredible jumping deaths, and at least one blatantly lame ""sword in the armpit"" overact.Toss in a bit of terrible and completely unnecessary CGI, and you have yourself a movie that would have every film fan ashamed to have every given anyone involved in the making of this monstrosity an ounce of your precious lives.If Arnie were dead, he'd be turning in his grave....as it is, he should find them one by one, dressed as a T1000, and stamp on their movie making equipment.",Conan the Barbarian

This was a fine film version, and I would hope to see another soon! I am rather stunned by any reviews that disparage the characterisation and execution of Nispel's origin tale for Conan of Cimmeria. That's who you get here: Conan, a Cimmerian, born on the battlefield -he fears no foe, and forces no friend. As a reader of the magazines once available at any 80s-90s garage sale, beside the records and the lava lamps and old army jackets, I thoroughly enjoyed this movie. Conan doesn't always have to look or talk the same as he did in the ""Conan Saga"" you already had. He's drawn, inked, and scripted by a different team. I think the 1982 Conan movie was basically a L Sprague De Camp written Conan, as drawn by John Buscema; and 2011's vision is as drawn by Tony DeZuniga or Ernie Chan.Momoa is not his character of Stargate Atlantis, he is a barbarian. He has little to say, but he is not mute -he's thinking. I'm afraid Schwartzenegger's Conan did not appear to be thinking much -maybe barely brooding. It's Conan in his own words.The director takes a moment to show what it means to be a Cimmerian, in the same way he showed what it meant to be pre-contact (Beothuck?) Native Americans and Colonial Vikings in his earlier movie, ""Pathfinder."" I greatly appreciated this unlooked for engagement in the Hyborian Age. Thus transported into this past age, I believed it when Rose McGowan showed me what it was to be a witch. I have met Rose McGowan, and she is not like that -this was a disturbing metamorphosis for her.I was grateful to see that Conan has finally taken to the sea on film. That period of his life spent as a pirate is -in my view- critical to his destiny as King. Conan's chapter as the pirate adventurer is as critical to the character as piloting the Millennium Falcon is to Han Solo.-SPOILER- The Enemy is destroyed utterly, mercilessly, brutally. This is no milquetoast modern tripe. I felt his victory as my own, and escaped the enemy's lair with my courage and skin intact right beside him, just like I did when I (and Barack Obama apparently) read the magazines.If we are lucky, Momoa will return, and we will see Conan begin his long winding road to the throne of Aquilonia.",Conan the Barbarian

Enter Conan. I believe that movies are supposed to lend you a suspension of disbelief, no matter how uncommon or out-of-the-ballpark they might be. To say that this movie does not accomplish this would be a drastic understatement. From the very beginning of the film we are thrust at with scenes such as a 10 year old beating a group of warriors, boulders being randomly pushed off a mountain side and conveniently aimed at only bad guys (for which we're rewarded my numerous ta-ta's), and a drastic underestimation of our basic understanding of metal working. There simply is no suspension, and by the time the film was finishing I, at least, was left drumming my fingers while my scripting predilections came true. In a nutshell, this film sucks!",Conan the Barbarian
248,christina-west09,Very Promising.... Equally Disappointing,3,22 August 2011,"I loved the old Conan film. But let me make it clear that I did not go into this film expecting an exact replica of the old film. When I watch these remakes of old 80's films I watch them as an independent expression of the story. Much like a film based on a book.Now that I've made that clear, I must say this film was not in any way good.Now I'm not going to run through every detail of the film, but I will list the points that detracted most from the film: -Let's start with something good, the first 15 minutes were great. Ron Perlman was amazing, and having to see him die actually brought tears to my eyes. At this point I had high hopes.-The script is terrible. You can almost feel the spelling mistakes. But what do you expect when the script was being rewritten DURING filming.-Conan doesn't come across as a level headed warrior, but as a whiny boy. Running every where saying ""I must find the man who killed my father."" Okay, I get it... Stop saying it.-Tamara (who plays the female protagonist, and Conan's love interest) is unbearable. There are many things I could say about this character, but the number one thing was the screaming. She would not stop screaming. Every time she shrieked at the top of her little lungs I was ripped out of the story. At a major point where I should be rooting for the character to live I sat there hoping she would die so my ears would be spared for the rest of the film.-Marique is okay. The over the top Gothic outfit and feel worked in my opinion. Seeing as she is supposed to represent such evil, and black magic. The only thing that could have been better here was the speech. She spoke so openly American, a subtle accent would have carried this character farther.And finally...-The Boss Battles. That is all I could call them. Conan fought boss after boss, until he reached the final boss and won the game. That's how it felt... Like a video game.This film is worth a dollar at Redbox, or maybe even $5 in the Walmart discount bin. All it is is some cheap thrills, if you can get over the terrible acting and script.

So, when I saw this new release coming out, to say I was excited was an understatement.I was the first person in the line at opening night in my local theater with butterflies in my stomach excitedly waiting to see what wonders await me.... then the movie started.Talk about a soul crushing disappointment, it is hard to even know where to begin. Was it the laughably campy acting, poor casting choices, or unintentionally comical story line... I can not say. All I know is that I left the theater, before the movie even ended, completely disgusted. What I can say, is that the fact the movie came out in August and was only in the theaters for 3 weeks and a mere 3 months later is on Netflix and Pay per view speaks volumes about it.I seriously doubt I will ever watch this movie again, even when it comes out for free in a couple months.",Conan the Barbarian

I know actors have to look different for different roles - obviously - but the guy on the screen was ... er ... just blllegh. I suppose it's a credit to him that he was in no way, shape or form similar to the awesome Ronan. Aside from that I found this film ultra heavy on the gratuitous violence, the way Conan was born was beyond ridiculous and had me suspicious of the quality of the rest of the film when it had only just begun, and half way through I was begging for Arnie to put in an appearance. Oh, go ahead and watch it, if you want. I've given it a 2 where others gave it 5 or more, so obviously someone liked it. I didn't get to the end.

Ron Perlman kills almost every movie that he doesn't star in (loved Hellboy), rest of the supporting cast is weak too.Too many things happen that don't get explained properly or don't make sense and we get too much fighting, too much slow-mo sword play, and thus: too much ""hollywood"". All that was missing was ""bullet time"" ffs... Storyline had merit, just too many holes and killed by a horribad script. I'd wager all the best parts wound up on the cutting room floor.

I'm amazed that Stephan Lang with his long and distinguished career even did this movie, he should have read the script a little closer. From what I can tell this production was simply a way for the dozen or so producers to make a payday for themselves and the director. The writers should removed from the writers guild and run out of Hollywood along with the director and should never be able to make another film. I'm sorry my revue jumps around between subjects but it's in keeping with this film. There is just so much wrong with this movie that there is no way to list it all. Every scene has problems and most of it comes down to the writing and direction, but I think this is true of most films these days. Poor writing shows!!! when are the suit and tie clowns in Hollywood going to realize this.",Conan the Barbarian
253,goku_san02,"A great action flick, not an Oscar contender",8,15 February 2012,"I can't help but feel the people rating this movie down were the ones who saw Schwarzenegger's Conan when they were teens and are now judging this without the rose-colored glasses of youth.I think Jason Momoa does a wonderful job on this style of Conan. While more energetic overall, his interpretation of Conan is very similar to his character of Ronon on Stargate Atlantis. He's a more youthful, brash, and hot-headed Conan than Arnold played and that's fine with me. This movie has no more and no less attention paid to the plot, dialog, and directing than many other action films both better and worse.I will take this poorly rated Conan reboot over the higher rated Indiana Jones and the Crystal Skull any day. This movie was made to have action and entertain and I feel that was accomplished.",Conan the Barbarian
254,avfanatic,Disappointing,7,28 August 2011,"Conan the Barbarian reboot was disappointingly average. The acting was solid, but dialog was often weak, art direction was uninspired and directing was poor at best. Not one single good transition between scenes in the entire movie. Only the first fight sequence was very good, the rest were meh. The director and writer should go see Rise of the Planet of the Apes to see how a franchise is rebooted well and with nods to the original. The ""mystery of steel""? Really? And the ramshackle Cimmerians with stick and hide huts but a well built forge and a reputation for being great smiths couldn't make nails for better housing? I had no problems with Momoa as Conan and his dialog about women and fighting was the only thing truly Conan about this film. I could go on about the dropped subplots and the inconsistencies with story, but that would just show my ire at not seeing what I hoped for: a new start for a great character.",Conan the Barbarian
255,branded-35041,"Nothing can replace the original, luckily this doesn't try.",8,3 November 2018,"The original 'Conan the Barbarian' is not a film that can be remade - it's a classic, a one of a kind. This film has been labeled a remake by some and I can only assume those who labeled it as such have either not seen it, or are trying to tie the two in order to hype the film. Likely the latter is closer to the truth.
All that said, this is another cool installment. The comics have always been some of my faves and I really haven't read comics or graphic novels for a long time, but I dig Conan. Wolverine too, but this is getting away from the purposes of this review.
The reason I bring up the comics is because this feels like another Conan-style adventure and that's why it shouldn't be compared to the original. I immediately bought the Conan comics that came out after the original film. They follow the original film, whereas this Conan film feels like the original comics.
Jason Momoa was a great choice to play Conan. He doesn't have muscles upon muscles like Schwarzenegger or like Conan from the comics, but he's cut enough and he clearly trained for the role and it really tells during the fight scenes.
All in all, the story could have been better. It didn't feel like a sweeping epic as the original did. There I go again comparing the two, but it's difficult to avoid, especially when discussing the story. It could have, and should have been better written. It felt rushed in a way the original didn't. For that I subtracted a couple stars.
Just know that these are two completely different films which have nothing in common with one another. View it with that in mind and it may add to your enjoyment of this film.

256,roel_van_tiel,Surprisingly lackluster,2,28 November 2020,"So, we have the familiar franchise. Big, rough, untempered brute fighting evil magic while saving an innocent maiden.Where the original did pay tribute to character building and put a heroic but tormented barbarian as main character, this movie tries to cast him as a flawless hero from second one, losing all that made the old movie worthwhile. No more chance on failure. No more self doubt. No, just the one dimensional hero fighting picture perfect battles on picture perfect locations.Felt like I was watching the Instagram movie. Now, settings are well done (computer generated), but that's about it. All characters are extremely one dimensional. The villain is just evil, no good in him. His daughter is just sorcerous, no seduction or backstabbers. The barbarians friends are all loyal to a fault and the barbarian a one dimensional do gooder. Oh, and the maiden is there just for the screams.I've seen cartoons with more depth. One point for the settings, otherwise avoid this total disaster of a movie. If you crave for Barbarian goodness, see the original. If you crave some rough hero movie, check the Mad Max series. And if you like the fantasy setting, check The Witcher or The Lord of the Rings.Shame really. With such a budget you could've made an actual fine movie.",Conan the Barbarian
257,vyrmin,Jason Momoa is perfect as Conan and he was a great choice to bring back Howard's ideals.,8,26 December 2011,"I will NOT call this a remake because THIS IS Conan, this IS who he should have been... this is not a Hollywoodized, overly watered-down, satire-saturated Aw-nald version. Do not get me wrong, I love the 80's movie but I grew up reading Conan, I loved the scope and depth that was captured in all those tales and John Milius's version was not Robert E. Howard's vision of who Conan was. Arnold was not the smart, skilled, disciplined and very-much-focused-on-his-goal warrior... He was an up-n-coming star who needed a star vehicle. The new Conan is an excellent, visually stunning and yes the storyline is stroppy and overly simplistic but it holds that mystical wonder of Howard's sagas. Jason Momoa is perfect as Conan and he was a great choice to bring back Howard's ideals, the way he was meant to be seen. I know this was horribly lambasted by the ADHD generation and needlessly torn apart by some critics, which is a damn shame 'cuz my only complaint - Rachel Nichols, who cannot act her way out of a wet paper bag. Make a bowl of popcorn and watch a seriously fun movie.",Conan the Barbarian
258,Emlen,Conan the Horrible,3,25 August 2011,"First of all, before I talk about the movie at all, I want you to know more about me. I am a huge fan of the Conan mythos; I've seen the old movies several times, I've read all Conan content Robert E. Howard ever produced, I've read the comic books, seen the old animated series, I play Age of Conan MMO, I've grown to despise the no-good deliberate distorter L. Sprague de Camp and I've even read the seven awful Conan books written by Robert Jordan. So, when I say I know Conan, I know Conan.I went into this movie with an open mind, although with low expectations, hoping despite all the negative reviews to find a decent action flick with a lot of blood and gore. But what I found was a letdown, to say the least. All I kept thinking was ""this film is terrible"".Speaking about terrible films; Conan the Barbarian from 1982 isn't really a ""Conan"" movie. While elements certainly are inspired by parts of the Conan mythos, Arnold's performance is about as far from the real Conan as you can get. Yes, Howard describes Conan as extremely big and strong, but also an agile graceful warrior, a brilliant leader and tactician - being able to speak many languages, including being able to to recognize, and even decipher, ancient writing. Arnold turned him into a semi-retarded lumbering oaf. That's not Conan.Jason Momoa is much more like Conan than Arnold ever was. His character is, at least, an attempt to be true to Howard's descriptions of the character. Personally I am a fan of Jason Momoa. That said, I have a few problems with this version of Conan. First of all, when it comes to appearance - Conan wasn't from Hawaii. Sure, that's a minor thing; even though Conan was white, his skin is frequently portrayed as bronzed from constant exposure to the sun. So, I can buy that. I'm having a little more trouble with the fact that his eyes were brown. Come on, why not use blue contacts, or use CGI to change the color of Momoa's eyes? Howard describes Conan as having smoldering blue eyes.But aside from those superficial missteps; you have an articulate, intelligent Conan with panther-like reflexes and all that jazz. The sad thing is, despite his potential, Momoa is very weak in this role and really adds nothing new or interesting to the character. He lacks something that makes Conan, well, Conan. No emotion! He's more like some sort of generic Hollywood fantasy action hero than a barbarian. Where's the wit, the humor, the brutality and the cunning that makes Conan a superstar barbarian? Only for a few short moments here and there Momoa was on the level that you'd expect from a role of this type.The pacing of this movie really is incredibly bad. It felt more like a checklist of locations, people, and fights that needed to be covered. I must admit that some of the environments and scenes were stunning, but they were never allowed to have their desired effect as you were just passed along from one thing to another. A lot of the scenes also felt old - like something that has been done many times before. It sometimes felt almost like they tried to create some sort of Prince of Persia, or The Scorpion King, clone.There is certainly nothing to be inspired by in this movie - nothing new and exciting at all. The pacing and editing is so bad and it feels like they were just hurrying along. The plot is a jumbled mess and the acting lacked in almost every aspect. The dialog is extremely weak and uninspired - it felt forced and flat, lacking any sort of finesse; it's almost like the screenwriters gave up and stopped trying after a while.Still, I guess this movie could have been ""saved"", or at least become more fun to watch, if the action scenes themselves were good. But no such luck: they were filmed using very fast paced cuts and it was very uninteresting and confusing to keep up with. The camera always seemed to be lagging behind the action, and just when it finally catches up with Conan to see what he's doing, the fight is over.To be fair, there were a few good characters, and the movie actually starts out with some promise: a decent intro narrated by Morgan Freeman, followed by a great moment on the field of battle - where Conan was born. Also, the scene from the trailer with young Conan being a bad-ass, killing picts like a boss, was great. The sad thing is that this probably was the highlight of the film, and it took place within the first ten minutes. Ron Pearlman did a good job of portraying Conan's father. He actually almost carried the early part of the movie by himself. He brought sensitively, feeling and depth, and actually made me believe in the film for a few moments. After that pretty strong start, the movie fell apart.Oh, I should probably add that Stephen Lang did a pretty good job of portraying the poorly written bad guy of the movie - Khalar Zym. Despite Lang's best efforts, Zym was never really frightening. They could have chosen a much better enemy to Conan. I'd chose James Earl Jones' Thulsa Doom from the 1982 version over that sissy Zym any day.In conclusion, if you are enough of a fan to see the new movie, go in prepared. What you will get is the closest adaptation of Howard's classic Conan so far (I can't deny that, even though it misses the mark more than a few times). What you won't get is anything even resembling a good film. You can say a lot about how bad the old Conan movies with Arnold were, but you can't deny that they had feeling.",Conan the Barbarian

262,markhof1007,Negative critics need to watch cartoons.,8,26 November 2011,"OK, all of you cry babies who's mommy must have burned your bacon this morning, get over it. Give this movie a break. It is closer to Howard's Conan than your opinion gives credit. Robert E Howard's ""Conan"" was an action adventure man of very few words. A hero of massive muscle but simple mind. A hero like most of Howard's heroes that, in the words of E Hoffmann Price, ""is simpler. You get them in a jam, and no one expects you to rack your brains inventing clever ways for them to extricate themselves. They are too stupid to do anything but cut, shoot, or slug themselves into the clear."" Conan started out as an ""untutored boy from the barbarous northlands, who could neither read nor write and who scorned such civilized skills as effeminate!"" Conan was blood-mad. He wandered around and physically took what he wanted. If you got in his way, he took your head. As written in the first few pages of the first book, ""Conan had his first taste of the luxuries of civilization when, as one of the blood-mad horde of Cimmerian clansmen that had poured over the walls of Venarium, he had taken part in the sack of that Aquilonian outpost. The taste had whetted his appetite for more."" In the same paragraph, Howard continues, ""He had no clear ambition or program of action; nothing but vague dreams of desperate adventures in the rich lands to the South."" At this time Conan was a fifteen year old boy. No Conan story ever had a plot or a moral or a happy, loving, feel-all-warm-inside ending. A distinct story line in a Conan movie? Give me a break. This movie has a simple premise that serves its' purpose. So enjoy the simple, barbaric, true to Howard's Conan movie and leave the story telling to your mommy when she tucks you in tonight.

Its just not every day that a classic movie from my childhood gets a new coat of paint so I decided, against my better judgement, to rent this pile-o-poo.Since this is a remake I'll rate this old vs. new style.Conan: While I do love Arnold in the move, the new guy looks more like a real barbarian. (Not to mention is F***ing sexy.) I however think that Arnold gave a much better performance mostly because of what he did vs. what he said. Watch the movie. He had like 6 speaking lines. It was perfect. This guy was too chatty and it just kills it. Point goes to ""OLD""Story: You can NOT mess with the old story. It was damn near perfect. The new story feels like I'm watching a rip off of other better moves. Heck, I'll name them for you: Pirates of the Caribbean, Indiana Jones(The temple-o-Doom), and to a lesser extent Prince of Persia... Point goes to the ""OLD""Music: For S*** sake the music is boring in this movie. If you've seen the first Conan movie then you know how utterly amazing the music is. It was so good you could listen to it by itself (though I'm into that...) but this crap is so bad you forget it's there at all. Point goes to the ""OLD""Bad Guys: Well that's easy... They suck... In the first one you have James Earl Jones playing a bad ass sorcerer who really commanded our respect. In this one you get the commando from Avatar. In the old one you got buff and flushed out second in commands. This one has the love child between Freddy Kruger and Wednesday Adams. She's hot, but that's about it... Point goes to the ""OLD"" again.There you have it. In no way shape of form is the new one better than the old.

The entire watch is extremely nice especially the fans of fantasy (as I am) and who like dynamic battles with a large dose of legends and magic. Personally: I recommend!Advantages: - Dynamic battle - Great atmosphere of fantasy - Conan the resurrection of the universe!Cons: - With blood and sometimes the clash is exaggerated and may weary - Spontaneously: a shallow box issues",Conan the Barbarian

No thanks Hollywood, you blew it.",Conan the Barbarian
269,Pekuvi,"A worthy remake: Very Strong start, entertaining middle and.......questionable end",8,19 August 2011,"Jason Momoa and the cast - The cast was refreshing. At least, Dwayne Johnson (The Rock) didn't play Conan. I like The Rock but after seeing him in Scorpion King, I felt he lacked authenticity and had too keen a nose for where the cameras were at all times. Fast forward to Jason Momoa, unless you're a fan of the Stargate Atlantis series or a true fan of his, I don't believe that you have had too much exposure to him. In my opinion, he can definitely carry the Conan franchise into the future. The rest of the cast also fits in quite well. The runaway star to me was ""young Conan""......watch out for him.The story - This version of Conan focuses more on blending different story lines than reprising the Arnold version so fans looking for sightings of Thulsa Doom and his gang of snake charmers need not bother. The opening is really strong with a young tempestuous Conan setting the ground work for a believable adult Conan who truly goes about ""living, loving and slaying"". Ron Perlman provides a more in-depth look at a parental figure in Conan's life than is shown in the Arnold version. The first 20 - 30 minutes of the movie are filled with poignant fight scenes and colourful villains that could just as easily have been in ""Last of the Mohicans"" as they were in Conan. If you like a good dose of violence, especially the gratuitous kind, the opening does not disappoint. The middle of the story really focuses on a check-off list. Conan goes on a tear looking for all the people who wronged him and his family and eliminates them one by one. This is where, in my opinion, Jason owns the Conan character. His injection of charisma into a rather blunt character as well as his creativity in dispatching all villains adds yet another element that is not shown in the Arnold version. I became a little more vested in his antics and I actually looked forward to how he would creatively dispatch the next bad guy. Then there is Tamara (Rachel Nichols) who replaces Valeria (Sandhal Bergman) from the Arnold version. Here, Valeria, to me, is a better character. Granted, Tamara is a priestess and Valeria is a warrior so I'm comparing apples to oranges here but, I feel a strong battling beauty would have gone a long way. The supporting cast in this Conan is more like sea fairing marauders as opposed to the minimal crew of three thieves and a wizard from the Arnold version. The end was a bit of a letdown to me. The leviathan/giant squid or whatever was under water was as pointless and useless as I've ever seen. Someone thoughtlet's throw something in here from Clash of the Titans or.hey this allows us to put in something with undulating limbs. This would pay homage to the snakes in the Arnold version. Complete waste of budget. Then, a lot was made about a mystical mask, its powers and this and that. Yet once dunned, it did absolutely nothing or at best, very little. To have this much story around that mask as there was around Conan himself and see nothing really happen was kind of a letdown to me. Pros: After all that I've had to say about the movie, I still feel it gets a solid 7 of 10 score. It is entertaining, and unlike movies like The Mummy and The Scorpion King, it does not shy away from showing violent scenes, Jason Momoa is as far from Arnold as it gets which to me is not a bad thing. The major actors all do good jobs and some of the minor characters actually steal their scenes. Young Conan is quite impressive. The battle scene on the marauders ship is worthy of Pirates of the Caribbean (the first two). Jason's sword work is rather skillful. I thought it was better than Arnold's. The use of varied landscape gives the story a broader panache and appeal. Rose McGowan comes off as certifiably crazy which isn't bad really.Cons: This is a personal gripe. I would have loved to see them remake the Arnold story. I thought it was a much better story. To see Thulsa Doom morph into a giant snake and shoot snake arrows would have been great to see with modern graphics. The end's fight scene made little sense to me. It seemed liked the writer got tired and couldn't wait to put ""The End"" and ""Fade Out"" or perhaps the writer wrote a strong end but the director and/or producer(s) decided to stick to some sacred time quota which lead them to truncate the end of the movie. Whatever the case, when you have a bad guy like Col. Miles Quaritch (Avatar) playing Khalar Zym (I'm referring to Stephen Lang here guys), you owe it to the audience to put him in the mother of all fight scenes at the end. He deserves to inflict pain and be taken out the manliest of ways. The Arnold version has Conan assuming the throne, a scene of solitude. He's lost his Valkyrie. In this version (which seems poised for a sequel) Conan leaves Tamara and rides off into who knows where. Don't really get itMy Opinion – Is it theater worthy? YES, in August and vs. Fright Night? Sure it is. It's not a bad way to spend $10.00 (even better ROI if you go and see it at the Matinée showing)Is it 3-D worthy? NOPE, I don't think you diminish your experience from watching it in 2-D. I just happened to watch in 3-D during a free screening. The 3-D part didn't impress me at all. I wouldn't pay $12.00 - $15.00 for the 3-D version.",Conan the Barbarian

People who have never read any of the original stories are quick to judge this movie but it completely delivered on capturing Conan's character which Jason Momoa did a perfectly brutal job of portraying along with the younger barbarian. Anyone in search for a break from the heroic type for some savagery, this is a must see! The directing is superb in following the graphic action which never takes a break for boredom in this flick and the costume design and the locations follow true to the Hyboria as described in the works of Robert Howard. One of the only flaws in this movie is the jumpy globe trotting with no sense of direction it could have shown a map like in the book at times in Indiana Jones style to give the viewer a sense of direction.

I don't know why the makers of this movie created such an awful trailer that misleads you into taking it for a remake of the Schwarzenegger movie - this is anything but.The 3-D is good enough that I eventually forgot about it, although it makes some of the action sequences muddy. And some of the drama could have been played up more - we never got the sense of the world being in peril that the narrator tried to suggest.

I have waited 27 years for another Conan movie, 29 for another good one, and now I hope they just leave the character alone. I had my doubts when I first heard Jason Mamoa would be the lead, and that Marcus Nispel would direct. So I went into this movie with low expectations but a lot of hope. Sufficed to say my expectations were too high, and my hopes, slowly but surely throughout the course of 2 hours were only for the merciful coming of the end of this....whatever this was. This is not Conan, it bears little to nothing in common with the character created by Robert Howard. The dialogue sounds as if it was written by teenagers, and what did they blackmail Morgan Freeman with to get him to do the monologue. The acting suffers from the poor writing and the actors cant force the drivel out with any sort of conviction. This movie could have been any generic sword and sorcery/fantasy film. I don't even know why I gave this 3 stars. It deserves maybe 2 for some decent scenery. What a waste.So the story is a young Conans father is killed by being bathed in molten metal, with Conan left by the evil Karim Zim ( Stephen Lang ) to witness it. Karim Zim is intent upon reuniting the pieces of a mask made from the bones of kings created in the ancient empire of Acheron. Well the mask was shattered by barbarians intent upon the overthrow of Acheron and the pieces divided up and hidden so that the terrible power would never be able to menace again. Wouldn't you know it Conans father happens to be one of the protectors of one of these pieces of this mask.So what happens once the diabolical Karim Zim gets a hold of the final piece and the mask is complete.....? Oh nothing not for another 12 YEARS !!!!!!!!....HUH?Yes you see the reuniting of the various pieces of the mask isn't all that is required. No, Karim Zim must find the "" pure blood "" of a descendant of ancient Acheron apparently to activate the masks powers, which he will use to return his wife, a witch who was apparently burned at the stack, to life so they may rule the world. This is where Rachel Nichols comes in as the prospective ""pure blood"" sacrifice whom Karim Zim took 12 years to find, allowing our hero Conan to be of an age to oppose him. I cant go on, I wish I could but it just gets worse and worse, even after Karim Zim gets the blood, without killing Rachel Nichols but leaving a nasty cut between her fake breasts, what does he do with the great power of this mask? NOTHING!!!! He gets into a sword fight with Conan, he doesn't miracle any monsters or demons to help him, what the mask does is apparently cling to Stephen Langs head looking like the face sucker from Alien.

273,Johnfromthenorth,This is not Black Lotus they are selling us pure haga. Bad Hollywood fantasy with no original ideas.,1,21 August 2011,"Fans have waited for 29 years for a new Conan movie and then we get this disaster. Obviously this was not going to be as good as the John Milius movie, but they could have at least tried. Maybe some people can enjoy this as a totally brainless action movie, but this is a bad fantasy movie and a worse Conan movie. The new Conan reminds me of the 80s Conan ripoff barbarian movies. First we have a narrator voice that certainly doesn't belong to a bloody barbarian movie. Then we have the ridiculousness of conans dad performing c-section in the middle of battle and then the movie spends 20 minutes with a little kid Conan. Apparently a cimmerian test of manhood or something is running around in a forest sucking an egg in your mouth and then the child Conan runs into some enemy tribesmen that are growling like orcs and kills them all. There is no need to try to prove how badass the hero is by having him slaughtering people when he is still a child. That is simply not believable just silly. Well then the tribe gets slaughtered by the evil warlord and conans dad is killed. Not even trying to be original here. The rest of the movie is some swordfights some monsters and some more swordfights. The only good thing was Stephen Lang as the villain. Khalars witch daughter was also fun. If Jason Momoa really was the best Conan they could find I guess that says something about todays action heroes, but at least he is not wearing the same ridiculous makeup he has when playing Drogo. I just don't understand how some people can say that this movie represents Robert E Howards original Conan? They must be talking about some different Howard. The same people who have spent years whining about how the classic Arnold movie was not loyal to the original stories are now thinking this is. This movie has no more connection to the original stories then the 80s movies did. I cant possibly imagine Jason Momoa in the original stories. People who keep saying this guy is the ideal original Conan should consider for example the story where Conan defeats the giant strangler in battle of pure strenght and breaks his neck. Can you actually imagine Momoa in that scene? The Milius movie was not loyal to the stories but it was an awesome movie with a unique feel and original ideas and it actually looked like something out of an ancient world where magic was real. The original movie also had the spirit of Howards best stories with a Nietschean survival of the fittest philosophy. The new Conan is bad Hollywood fantasy made by talentless hacks. The next Conan movie will probably be direct to DVD. The scriptwriters and director Marcus Nispel should never work again.",Conan the Barbarian
274,jesuschrist666666,Only Those With Lady Parts Won't Like It,10,21 August 2011,"I would like to begin by saying whoever was in charge of editing the trailers for this movie should never be hired again. THEY ARE MISLEADING, THIS MOVIE IS NOT CHEESY This action packed adventure is truly a man's movie. It's filled with brutal violence, blood, tits, and fire. Everything a growing boy needs.The movie opens with a sort of prologue of Conan's origin which is amazingly well done. It sets the tone the of the entire movie and cast out any anxiety of the ""cheesiness"" the trailers implied. The beginning really gets the testosterone flowing and is my personal favorite part of the movie.As far as the story goes it's pretty well written with a decent ending. It has a lot of excitement and shows the some of the brutality of Conan's world.Action wise this movie is off the charts. If you like Rambo you will love it. The special effects of the blood splatters and sword strikes are done very well. And there's a whole lot of hardcore skull smashing, need i say more.Another high point of this movie are the visuals. A lot of the landscapes and scenery look really bad ass.The acting in the movie was pretty good. With the exception of Rose McGowan, everyone played their parts and did their lines well. I was kind of surprised how well Jason Momoa played Conan.I recommend that more people go see it. Don't let the horrible trailers mislead you. This movie is every bit as good as Arnold's and in fact, one of the best men's movies to come along in a while.Keep in mind that these are just the opinions of a real man. If your the type of guy that only drinks wine, thinks Casablanca is the best movie ever, or somebody with lady parts you are going to hate this movie.",Conan the Barbarian

When one thinks of the many adventures we went on with the Conan novels, todays technology and the hunger for something wonderful, damn, what a shame. I would have been happy with campy like the first Conan, but I was more entertained with ""Year One"". At least Harold Ramis and Jack Black knew they were making a bad film in the name of bad film. Nispal, boy what can I say and not be brought up on charges. Ron Perlman, his character looked as if he belonged on an SNL skit. Jason, is no Conan and that is all I'll say about him. Mr Lang, please go back to the stage, The Speed of Darkness misses you. As for the ladies in the film, fire your agent. Here is the real kicker, I went to this this film on opening day, 10 people total. At todays prices for 3D, wow, I really felt like asking for my money back.

Howard would be proud,10,21 August 2011,I have read over 100 plus novels on Conan & this movie is just like the books 8)an absolute wonderful representation of Robert's Hyborian world. He would be so proud of everyone who was involved in the making of this grand adventure.This is not the remake of Conan the Barbarian and is completely different and that's a good thing.The combat and action plays out exactly how the books are fast and furious. The blood and guts were literally sailing across the screen with enemies cleaved visceral style and brutal and with no yip yapping this is Conan not King's Speech. It's all about crushing & slicing enemies and saving the hot babe 8) The books when you read them you never really get a chance to catch your breath it's just mayhem never a dull moment and this movie follows that perfectly.I liked all the actors they did a excellent job and Jason was pure Conan Frank Frazetta ALL THE WAY.. I gave it 10 out of 10 because when I compared this movie to the over 100 novels and comic books I have read the spirit of Robert E Howards world truly lives on.,Conan the Barbarian

I'm not trying to compare two Conan movies, just two ""sword and sorcery"" movies, one made with talent and other one without it, because when I go to the cinema I don't go just because of the main character, I go because I want to watch a good movie, and even when I like the genre, Marcus Nispel didn't help this one to be a good movie. I'm not going to say anything about the script or the actors, because they did it OK, at least in the Spanish dubbed version, I'm not sure about how they sound in English, and the script was not a great script, but good enough for an adventure movie.My complains are, too much slow motion bits and not very well placed, too much and tiring barbarian bawling, not very good battle scenes and the extras in the battle scenes weren't at their best, abuse of the background music or music themes poorly chosen, and I didn't like the narrator, at least in the Spanish version. In other movies the narrator is like another character and suits well with the movie, but in this one it looked like if it was put there just to save money and not explain or show what was happening. He just speaks twice, but I would change that for more auto-explicative scenes or a couple of minutes more of movie.I hope this poorly done movie doesn't ruin the chances of other future Conan movies.",Conan the Barbarian
278,octoberartist,"The title is Conan, but the movie is not.",1,22 August 2011,"In order for Conan to be successful, it needs to be epic and dramatic. Unfortunately this movie is neither. Think along the lines of Braveheart, Gladiator or Lord of the Rings. The plot to Conan the Barbarian is a very bad rip-off of Lord of the Rings littered with some elements of the 1980's version of Conan. It is all action and special effects and little else.It's as if the producers and director were totally unfamiliar with the Conan universe or character and were just trying to make bank off the name. They would have done well to read Robert E. Howard's essay on the Hyborian Age before undertaking this movie instead of just making it up as they go.For example, the map is wrong and the place names are incorrect and some of the landscapes used aren't as Howard described. The score is utterly unmemorable. Much of the dialogue makes no sense. For instance, Zym saying, ""Behold and Despair"" to a gathering of his own people? Were they drunk when they were editing this? There is also a lovely shot of young Conan doing a kata? Who knew that an ancient barbarian tribe cut off from civilization had developed Japanese martial arts almost 10,000 years before it existed? Certainly not me. One of the core elements of Conan is man's ability to overcome through sheer strength of body and will. You won't find that in this movie.Ron Perlman did a great job acting, as always. He wasn't the right actor for the role though, because he has no resemblance to either the young or old Conan. Whoever made the decision to make him a blond Cimmerian is retarded. Leo Howard makes for a fine young Conan, does a great job acting but is much too small for the role. The real young Conan was much larger than his peers. It also would have been a bit more believable had he left the martial arts moves out. Conan was not a black belt.Conan's trademark is his square cut black mane and volcanic blue eyes. Neither will be found in this movie. Conan did not have little patches of stylistic facial hair, a perm or brown eyes. Nor did he wear a red, 'kilt'? With those fixes and another 20lbs of bulk, Momoa could do a convincing job as the Barbarian. Given a different director, I'd give him another chance.Stephen Lang did awesome and Marique stole the show for me. Tamara had the weakest acting in the movie, some great costumes, but she was unable to create interest in her character. Conan and Zym's henchmen were terrible, straight out of a b-rated S&S flick.Really disappointed as I've been waiting my whole life to see Conan the Barbarian on screen and it just isn't happening. I keep getting made up origin stories. Guess I'll have to be content with the the books. Some day, I hope Lionsgate discovers how to visualize a story. Perhaps they could watch Game of Thrones on HBO and pick up a few pointers. Thanks Lionsgate for making a mockery out of my all-time favorite character and fictional universe.On a positive note, my wife, who knows absolutely nothing about Conan enjoyed the movie. I think the highlight for her was Momoa's ass. Pretty sad when that's the most memorable moment.",Conan the Barbarian
279,Skiritai,Not the 80s movie... but still very good,9,25 August 2011,"The reboot of Conan was actually pretty good. I was sort of disappointed that they didn't make the story more like the books, and instead took some influences from the 80s movies... but I also could understand why they did it that way.The movie was surprisingly well put together. It was never intended to be an intellectual piece, therefore the movies gold all lies in it's ability to entertain... and it definitely delivers in the entertainment department. The action scenes were amazing. I'd say only one scene tried to hard to make things look cool. The other fights were brutal and bloody... and just what one wants out of an action movie from today. The story is a bit simplistic but doesn't really take away from the entrainment value of the movie. The humor appeals to the male chauvinist spirit... in ways making fun of the way the book series was written.Being a fan of Conan since I was a kid, having read book and comic books of the character... I know that Momoa played a better Conan than Arnold did. People get all up in arms over that thought... but it's true. I could care less that Momoa is smaller than Arnold was. The truth is, his character is more true to what R. Howard intended the character to be. The reason that this movie seems to be getting such bad reviews is because of all the morons that can't seem to realize that it's possible for someone other than Schwarzenegger to play Conan the Barbarian, and still have it be a good movie. To many people are caught up in what the old movie was, and end up comparing every aspect of the new movie to the old one.Going into this movie you have to forget everything about the old 80s movie and take this as a product of its own. If you can do that... you'll find that the movie is surprisingly good, and very entertaining.",Conan the Barbarian

Movie lacked a bit of scope and could have used some more subtlety to even out the pace. There wasn't much in the way of the introspective Conan that is needed to really make the ferocious Conan that much more intense but Momoa did a great job with what he was given to work with as did the rest of the cast aside from Rachel Nichols. Score was cool but lacked any definable theme or melody that sticks in your head and makes you think of the movie after its finished. I like Nispel but he could have balanced the movie better. Would absolutely love a sequel but something darker, not as flashy looking and not so focused on getting as many fights in as possible. Anyway, people complaining about this movie need to loosen up, its not ""No Country For Old Men"" or something super deep and artistic .... its CONAN!!!

That said, i went in with low expectations, but this movie actually ended up being REALLY good in my opinion. Someone said the movie didn't have a plot, when in fact, if you actually WATCH the movie, it has a pretty good plot. Of course the movie isn't perfect, as is NO movie nowadays. Some of the sets looked pretty fake, but of course im watching them on a 60 inch screen so the detail is pretty good. I think this movie could be compared to Clash of the Titans, in both acting and story. All in all, i give this movie an 8/10. Other than a few sets, everything else was pretty good.

The older Conan was fine but he talked too much. I was really disappointed with this movie.It feels cobbled together at the last minute.""no man should live in chains"" says Conan....where is that from since he wasn't taken as a slave.The original story tells why he was such a great swords man, this story leaves you believing that it was in his blood.I pray they don't make another along these lines, I wont pay to see it.",Conan the Barbarian

The cast had the talent to deliver a story, the writing it seems was crap and direction was even more crap then writing. Now the casting (not the cast) was also a POS failure.It seems like nobody other than the actors wanted to actually make this movie and honestly I can't even tell there. Bottom line for something so thin so shallow, with a storyline that could have been written by third grade primary school boy you must blame the Director and the studio for letting it even get as far as hiring someone to do the sketches for the scenes.There is always a lot of talk about how too many movies just are not profitable to make anymore and if movies like this keep being made the blame cannot be put on the audience. Bottom line, too many pretty people (which is not bad in itself), the wrong kind of people, no story, crap direction, sound scoring was crap, Morgan Freeman sounded nice, costumes were crap, I am sorry I wasted a part of my life watching it, though I did watch it till the end always hoping it would have some redeeming moment that never came.Having been an action movie fan for the 30+ years I have been on this planet I am considering just being done with the genre all together just because of this movie; perhaps the straw that broke the camel's back.It's as bad as Kull the Conqueror, if not worse since Kull never really got the budget or the credit this film did.",Conan the Barbarian

287,StevenNcl,Conan the Rubbish!,3,19 November 2011,"Given the hype and press of this movie, and the look of Jason Momoa I had quite high expectations, I didn't expect it to reach the heights of the original Conan the Barbarian with the guttural Arnie in his seminal role, fantastic direction by John Milius and an Oliver Stone screenplay but I thought it would be decent. The opening 30 minutes surpassed that expectation with great childhood sequences and the ever reliable (even made Season of the Witch almost watchable) Ron Perlman.The film then just turn into really poor, studio executive driven, careful treading, directing by committee rubbish. The reason the Lord of the Rings trilogy was so believable and so watchable was because Peter Jackson owned those movies - he was the auteur and thankfully, he's back on The Hob bit and I believe him not working on it, was a ploy to get his own way. The original Star Wars without CGI were able to suspect dis-believe because George Lucas believed in it and even Harry Potter, as much as some didn't like it, JK Rowling had final say on the script so if the execs who thought they knew best tried to make the Weasley twin live or Harry to hook up with Hermione, she could tell them to bugger off.This reminded me of The Eagle. At least it didn't pretend to be based. The shame is, had they brought in a good director, Conan could have been great - it needed a re-write and a re-think but the potential elements were in place. Had they decided to build the character of Conan (didn't they want a franchise? That's unlikely now) had they developed the sub-characters further and HAD THEY LET THE GIRL DIE IN THE END then at least there would have been a movie closer to it's roots. Does anybody know why Morgan Freeman was ever brought in to narrate when he didn't even close out the film? Conan the Barbarian? Conan the Rubbish. 3/10 (but above the last Indiana Jones abomination).",Conan the Barbarian

Young Conan is totally impressive, yes he is majorly angro but can you blame him? It is sad that this movie did not hit it big in the theatres and that people were so stuck on comparing it to the old Conan movies. When will there be another movie like this?? Never, it's all the same boring bs these days. This movie stayed true to Robert E Howard's style and the comics. There will probably be no sequel, which I think is a total loss for this franchise.

290,MoBiUG,Pulpy Action Goodness!,8,16 August 2011,"I'll make no secret of it, I've been rooting for this film for a while. I like the first Conan, the sequel was pretty horrible. Aside from the Princess. She was MAJOR hotness! Having read a lot of Conan though, including the original stories and the more recent Dark Horse comics, I don't think that John Milius got it right.This isn't a remake and I think that Jason Momoa embodies the character of Conan far better than Arnie did. It is, however, an origin story and it does, sadly, straddle the same material as the 1982 film. It's the lack of originality that, I feel, works against the film more than anything. The script couldn't be any more generic if it tried.That said, as a pulpy piece of action/adventure goodness, I think it succeeds. As I said, Momoa embodies the character well but where he really sells it is in making swordplay look awesome. He nails the fight scenes, giving Conan great versatility when it comes to a scrap, and there are a lot of them. That's one of the reasons I found this so much fun to watch. It moves at such a pace that I found it impossible to get bored. Most of the dialogue is either foreboding an action scene or during an action scene.The action really is great though. Shot well, nice choreography and plenty of high impact violence. This is full blooded stuff.Momoa is supported well. Stephen Lang is effortlessly great as the villain, Khalar Zym, and Rose McGowen seems to be having fun as his freaky, witch daughter, Marique. Neither gets that much screen time though and their creepy relationship could have been better explored. Ron Perlman is... well... Ron Perlman. Not much to work with, but he works it like a pro.The weakest link here is Rachel Nichols as Tamara. She's integral to Zym's evil scheme but her burgeoning love of Conan feels forced and one sided. Conan nails her (of course, she's a babe), but doesn't seem to care that much for the most part. Which sort of made me chuckle. Don't know if it was supposed to.The first 15-20 minutes show Conan in his mid teens, and here he's played by Leo Howard. Screw Momoa having to fill Arnie's shoes, Momoa has to fill this kids shoes too. He's quality in this with two stand out action scenes to boot. Same kid played young Snake Eyes in 2009's GI Joe.If there's one other thing I didn't like about this film it was the random globe trotting. By the end, I sort of stopped caring where things were occurring because I never got a sense that any real distance was being travelled. Even though it was. I felt the same disconnection in the The Mummy Returns, if that's any indication of what I'm talking about.All told, I think this is a lean, satisfying action flick. I'd love to see a sequel that riffs off the source material more, bringing in some established characters. What's here really worked for me and... I'm probably damning this with faint praise in saying it is, hands down, the best thing Macus Nispel has ever made. I feel like he really got behind this.",Conan the Barbarian

Not only does the movie not flow, it doesn't make any sense. one why would conan lead an army? even as a kid he obviously didn't get along with the other wannabe warriors of his tribe, yet he can lead an army into battle? really. also when zim destroys conan's village, he just then leaves without doing anything to conan other than leaving him with his father. crap, a guy supposedly that evil would not just leave that way. he went there on a purpose, not to mention this is probably not his first village he sacked. you're telling me he didn't take slaves or anything. yeah, right. i love how conan jumps from place to place without having to actually travel there. its like in one screen shot he's in a city, then the next he's on a cliff edge.also when zims boat comes upon conan's boat, how do the enemy soldiers get onto conan's boat? there's no scene where they climb aboard or anything, it's one minute there looking from the deck of there ship then the next scene there in the hull of conan's ship, even after conan's crew wins the fight, where is the enemy ship? did they sink it, did they just leave it there out in the sea?again, this movie could of been really good, but next time this crew makes a movie about a book, read the book. also, in 1982 there was a movie called conan, maybe u should of watched that and taken a few pointers, thats a movie thats a lot better and without the 30 yrs of technology that this crew had.",Conan the Barbarian

The character is brawn, muscle-packed, raven-haired and jet-black eyes... exactly as in the comic. He is charismatic, yet a loner, tough yet gentle when needed and most of all Conan is not a brutal barbarian which all seem to think.Plot might be weak, then again there are several Oscar-winners with no plots at all or at best limited (see In a Better World).The movie delivers what is intended, power-clad action wrapped up in a barbarian's fist.",Conan the Barbarian

297,jerrygrossman,Entertaining...,8,19 August 2012,"Fast paced action ,violent,great effects makes this a winner.As an avid comic book fan,including many of the Marvel titles now on film I see no use in a comparison with the the great comics of that day. Saw it now on Netflix and for the money it was well worth my time. I will watch it again since the dialogue was a bit rough to understand but was impressed with the lush scenery and gore in it's depiction of this barbaric world. It turns into a love story but so what...films like these are made for sequels and for the genre I was quite surprised and enjoyed it. We are not talking Fellini and film as art but Conan, so enjoy. Shades of the original Planet Of The Apes throughout made it doubly entertaining.",Conan the Barbarian
298,gregory-spikeman,Awful,3,3 April 2012,"I'm a big fan of R.E. Howard's ""Conan."" I read all the original literature, have almost the entire Marvel comic book series, am a big fan of the ORIGINAL movie, and I named my first born after the famous barbarian. So, I was obviously excited about the prospects of another Conan movie. Well, last night I finally saw it. Here is the good: 1) Locations were well done. From the forests of Hyperborea to the mountains of Cimmeria, to the shores of Zingara, they were very close to what I imagined them to be. 2) Armor and weapons were ""historical"" to some degree. 3) The fantasy element was in its right place - not too much magic. 4) The guy playing Conan was okay, the main chick was pretty hot, and some of the supporting cast were decent.Now for the bad: 1) very lousy story, cheaply sown together tatters of dialogue in between lots of fighting sequences. 2) Horrible battle and fighting scenes. Every swing of the plastic sword was digitally accelerated, making it difficult to follow and much less dramatic. Too much unrealistic fancy swordplay. 3) Cinematography was overall lousy. Every shot was short, like a frame in a comic book. So short, in fact, that much of the detail is completely lost. Also, the transitions between these frames was badly done and lacked continuity. For example, Conan and Tamara are running for their lives in one short scene in a crumbling castle, which is followed by another short 2-second scene showing the castle falling apart, which is immediately followed by one where Conan and Tamara are calmly riding on horseback on the beach. 4) Unlike the original, the music score is completely forgettable. 5) No religion, which was an integral part of the Hyborian world. Conan does not say ""Crom"" even once, and there is no mention of Set, Ishtar, Bel, Ymir, Mitra, or any of the others. Even the evil ""sorcerer"" in the movie does not have any official affiliation to a cult or god/goddess. This is completely unrealistic and greatly takes away from the immersion factor.It seems obvious to me that a lot of research went into this movie, but it was a wasted effort. This film will never replace the epic ORIGINAL.",Conan the Barbarian
299,maxwinnall,Not to bad,5,4 April 2012,"Although this film does not live up to expectations of the original Conan, it has many aspects which makes this film enjoyable. For instance the violence which occurs throughout makes the movie more enjoyable. This film has no qualities that will make it a huge hit, but i recommend if your looking for a movie to sit down and simply enjoy this would be a great option. Yes, the imagination is extremely minimal, and goes almost completely against the original movie, the film is still enjoyable. It is simple a movie which through out has an extremely simple story line with fight scenes thrown in. Overall this movie wont change anything, and has an extreme lack of imagination but for a movie to enjoy, or pass the time its worth watching.",Conan the Barbarian
300,myria639,Let me tell you of the days of LOW adventure!,3,16 July 2012,"The bad: The musical score-This MADE the original. It gave much atmosphere and dread. The score in this is pretty much bleh. They could have done a more memorable score. The dialog-They ""talked wrong"" They didn't talk like barbarians and such. They talk too modern in this one. The costumes-LAZY ASS designers. They had guys wearing friggin' Samurai helmets and at one point Conan was wearing a Roman gladiator arm guard. The original had cool evil armor and swords. The Shawshank guy- Why the hell is he narrating? Poor choice and did not fit a barbarian movie. Hellboy dad- Really? The monkey-face Hellboy guy as his father? They could have picked better. The bad guys sucked- There was no dread or fear generated from any bad guy in this one. I'm spoiled by the evil Set cultists from the first one. CGI-Too much CGI. The sand warriors were pretty cool but there was too much CGI which looks fake and is boring. Real fake blood and old school special effects are always better to look at. The Good: The guy playing Conan wasn't bad actually but was failed by poor writers/directors/costume people/entire staff basically.",Conan the Barbarian

302,winterstorm2040,Total letdown,3,30 September 2012,"I saw the earlier titles of Conan the barbarian with Arnold Schwarzenegger that where great movies which i liked a lot.When i first heard that someone was gonna produce a remake i was all hyped up and had huge expectation for the movie that where never met,after i watched it i taught it was a total flop compared to the original movies,a disgrace.The storyline is boring,the characters lacked credibility in their roles,Arnold was much more believable in is role than Momoa who clearly can't act.And the movie soundtracks of the originals where so beautiful and full of life,compared to the lifeless and boring musical themes of this version.Warning avoid this movie at all cost,unless you want to spend 1:30-2:00 watching a big ape swinging a sword.Ps:Stick with the original versions !",Conan the Barbarian
303,thevikinglord,Great job,10,19 August 2011,"As a fan of the comics and the original movie this movie is great. Jason Momoa nailed the essence of the corrector, he is CONAN.For those confused this wasn't a remake of the John Milius Version, just a better translation of the Comics/Novels.The fight scenes and special effects were all top notch.Some of the scenes were ripped straight from the pages of the comics.Seriously don't know why people are downing on this movie it had everything the comic embodied Battle,blood and Sex. My only complaint if any would be that i wish Tyler Bates Score could have been a little more re-memorable. The Basil Poledouris score took on a life of its own and brought a since of emotion that otherwise wouldn't have been there..",Conan the Barbarian
304,louieadame,Conan,10,12 May 2014,"I have owned and read the series of books by Conan, for many many years. This is a better movie than the one Arnold made many years ago. This actor fits the perfect young Conan in my book. Hopefully they will make book 2. As you know there are 8 or 10 books about Conan, when he is born to the age of 70 plus. Excellent movie and I hope they make more of them. Finally a movie worth watching about my favorite Conan books. I just found this movie and have watched it 5 times ha. Hopefully they will make the next movie full of dragons and reflect more of the action in the books. This movie comes closes in what I have read in the Conan books. The actor most reflects the character in the Conan books. Not a bad job and if you have not read the Conan series than you haven't read the books.",Conan the Barbarian
305,sendgarbagespamhere,You're not ready for this... movie,2,26 June 2014,"Where to begin with this train wreck? The story isn't very cohesive for one. The movie skips around quite a bit with very little explanation why the characters are going where they are going. The characters, including Conan, are all pretty generic and woefully underdeveloped. Half of them are only mentioned by name or introduced a single time if at all, the other half explode in a fountain or poorly rendered CGI blood so fast that their names are irrelevant any ways.While there was more development of Conan's father's character and his people, which I personally liked, the movie skips to Conan in his mid twenties (I'm guessing?) with nothing more than a brief narration explaining how he became the juggernaut of rubber sword slaughter that we now see...Despite the main villain achieving his long sought after goal at the open of the movie he is still wandering around looking for the other half of the puzzle, which he just happens to find after all these years, just now as grown up Conan gets involved to save the day? The fight scenes are lame and reminiscent of Hercules the legendary journeys or Kull the Conqueror. Many of the visuals are so obviously computer generated that it interferes with immersion (i.e. the tentacle monster).Unoriginal, unimaginative and unentertaining sums this movie up. Just as the fantasy genre rose in the 80s with great movies like the Original Conan the Barbarian and was killed due to a slue of crappy poorly written fantasy movies, Hollywood seems intent on repeating this mistake with movies like this. I just hope this mistake doesn't end Jason Momoa's career the way Kull ended Kevin Sorbo's...",Conan the Barbarian
306,reddragon2426,"Loud, Bloody but extraordinarily mediocre",5,24 November 2011,"Hollywood has never really gotten the hang of making fantasy films and this is no exception. It's big, loud, and sweaty with an abundance of muscular men and buxom maidens but you never feel connected to any of it. The filmmakers tried to cram too much of Hyboria into one movie and the result is a fast paced mess that never really finds itself.One big problem I noticed is that not enough time was spent making the props and sets look convincing. Many times you are so incredibly aware that you are watching a movie you wouldn't bat an eye if Conan began clashing steel with the boom mike. Swords are swung as if they weigh mere ounces, sets often look rickety, and even the rocks appear to be made of foam. These kind of mistakes were forgivable is TV shows made on a shoestring budget but are entirely inexcusable in a major Hollywood production. If they had spent more time polishing the look of the sets and working on the actors handling of the prop weapons it would have made it much more convincing.One the other hand, despite it's flaws there is some fun to be had here. Conan does feel like a throwback to the low-budget fantasy films that were common in past years. Plenty of attractive women that inexplicably walk around topless. Drunken bar fights with the bad guys henchmen. Characters that exist only as plot devices. Best of all, Stephen Lang looks to be having fun providing more overacting than I have seen since Jeremy Irons graced us with his performance in Dungeons and Dragons. So, if you are a fan of those B-grade fantasy flicks (I know I am) you will probably find this at least enjoyable enough to watch once. To be honest, I wouldn't mind seen Jason Momoa play Conan again in a better written and produced movie. Alas, I don't see that happening and I really think that's a shame.",Conan the Barbarian
307,ulfartribe,"If you didn't know that ""Messantia"" was in Argos...you probably shouldn't have watched this movie.",10,23 January 2015,"First opening scenes. THAT WAS REH's Conan in his youth. The Picts were AWESOME. The reference that you get that this story takes place after ""Tower of the Elephant"" tells you that Conan is still a young, hot-headed egomaniac...just like in the stories. Quick for action, smart but not always thinking through. That was REH's Conan in the stories. He's about 17 or so at Tower of the Elephant, but a hulking tall figure. So, ya...his impulsiveness, brashness, etc fits the character.I seriously think that only purists would have really appreciated this movie. THAT was the real issue. Plus people don't seem to understand REH's ""Sword & Sorcery"" genre. It is supposed to be brutal, over the top, and FUN. No societal lessons, no purposeful ideology. With the one exception of the theme that, ""The idea of what constitutes ""barbarian"" vs ""civilized"" is not as clear cut as you may think.""",Conan the Barbarian

We watched this film recently and enjoyed it a lot, but to read reviews left for it, you'd think we missed something. ""This movie stinks because Conan is supposed to have sidekicks!"" Oh yeah? Says who? ""This movie stinks because the storyline only consisted of Conan chasing some bad guys!"" Right, just as with every other Conan movie out there. ""This movie stinks because it wasn't believable!"" Um....it's FANTASY? And don't forget reviews like, ""This movie stinks because Conan's psychological profile and nascent humanity didn't connect to the the in-depth socio-political ramifications found in earlier Conan films, blah blah blah I have a degree in literature from Harvard.""Sorry, but the actors, sets, costumes, and plot in the 2011 ""Conan"" were all good and made the film a lot of fun, but go ahead, compare it to the Arnold films and whine that such films haven't been good since the 1980's. bad reviews sometimes have merit, but they can also be something else. Saw a classic 1940's film last week on TV that had a rating of 72%, whatever that means. Then I saw another movie from a few years back about millennials, the end of the world, and the apparent need to say the ""F"" word every 10 seconds. That got a rating of 97%.

309,cacat-65770,Much Better than I was expecting,7,30 May 2015,"I watched this today on Netflix not expecting much and was pleasantly surprised.The film looked very good visually and it was well shot. The casting was good. Ron Pearlman never disappoints, Rose Mcgowan plays a captivating evil witch, Rachel Nichols i.e.the lead actress from continuum played a solid leading lady although I did spend a portion of the film trying to figure out where I recognized her from and who better to play the lead that Jason Momoa AKA Khal Drogo from Game of Thrones (the actor was made for playing Barbarians) and he's pretty easy on the eye too.Sure it's not going to win any Oscars and the dialog isn't great (what do you expect from a Barbarian anyway.I appreciate that for die hard Conan fans no one will replace Arnie but if judged on it's own merits is's a well paced and engaging film which didn't lose my interest.For an action film to pass a few hours it's worth giving this a try.",Conan the Barbarian

311,hcwang,Blu-Ray Edition of the Movie: Disappointed about movie,7,23 November 2011,"There were a lot of places in the movie where it was not realistic and moving like a comic strip rather than a movie. There was no transition between scenes. Feel like it needed to be narrated. The basic story plot was decent. It tells the story from Conan's point of view. The way that Conan came into the world was cruel and did not need to be shown. The soldier that escorted the ""True Blood"" away from the temple had crashed into a rock, but the carriage could not have traveled that fast to cause a fatal injury to the head. There was too much blood in the whole movie because you could tell it was fake.Overall it was a decent movie. I like Rose's performance as the little witch. However I did not like the way she died.",Conan the Barbarian
312,joshkin2001,"Decent, and true to the vision",7,4 April 2012,"OK, you're going to read a lot of reviews about how awful this movie is. It's not. For all the people who claim to have read, and loved, Howard's books, and then trash this movie, they obviously suffer from looking at the past through rose-colored glasses, and they obviously haven't read Howard since they were teens. Howard's books weren't good, they were pulp. And this movie is pulp, and it's pretty good pulp.Conan is NOT a 'complex', or 'deep and brooding' character; he's a thug with a sword. And Momoa is the first actor to play him even close to Howard's vision. Howard's plots were not 'deep', his target audience was sexually frustrated 15 year old boys. To ascribe any 'literary' qualities to his books is BS. And this movie, true to Howard, targets the same audience. Is the dialog good? No; neither was Howard's. Is the action good? Yes. Are the women hot and half naked? Yes. And THAT is the soul of Howard's Conan - violence and sex packaged for the 50's audience. What struck me most about this movie is that for the first time, I saw on screen a movie that was true to Howard's Conan. Not Arnold's Conan, not the Conan from the broadsheet comics or the horrible comics from the 80's, but Conan as Howard wrote him: brutal, grand, violent and only interested in the next piece of a**. If you love Howard's books, you'll like this movie. If your vision of Conan comes from anything else, you'll hate it; but in that case, you never 'got' Conan in the first place. Kudos to Momoa; he did a GREAT job, and I'll happily pay to see him do it again. One thing - avoid the 3D version, it's positively pain inducing. Rent the video and watch it in 2D.",Conan the Barbarian
