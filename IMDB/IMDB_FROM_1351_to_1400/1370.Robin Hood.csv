0,TheLittleSongbird,"Valiant attempt, but overall dull and disappointing",4,1 January 2011,"I love Robin Hood, and I do like Ridley Scott's films, so this did have the ingredients to be good. Sadly, while it was a valiant attempt, it didn't work for me. The film does look good, with the cinematography excellent and the sets, scenery and costumes authentic enough. The score was a nice touch, it wasn't amazing, but it worked on the whole thanks to some beautiful orchestration. Overall, the archery, fighting and sword play were well handled, Scott's direction is assured and there are some bright spots in the cast namely Oscar Isaac, Max Von Sydow and Mark Strong.Conversely, my main problem with this film is that it doesn't feel like a Robin Hood movie. If anything it feels like a sequel to Gladiator, but with a less compelling story and bad dialogue. Yes I understand it is an origin story, but the film's tone is rather too serious. This is not helped by the sluggish pacing in the latter half further disadvantaged by somewhat dull chemistry between Russell Crowe and Cate Blanchett. The story doesn't always know which direction it wants to go, and I actually found myself confused by some scenes, and the film is much too long, an hour and three-quarters is a perfect length if done right. Then there's the script, which didn't flow very well at all. Also, Crowe didn't work for me. He tried hard to create a commanding and charismatic presence, but what let him down were his dialogue and his accent which came and went. I was disappointed in Cate Blanchett too, she is a fine actress who has given mesmerising performances particularly in Notes on a Scandal and the Elizabeth movies, but she isn't given very much to do apart from a nice touch where she joins in for the final battle. Ah yes the final battle, this was a disappointment actually too. It was well shot with some good sword play and the like but it was badly paced and kind of ran on a parallel with Saving Private Ryan but less gut-wrenching and compelling.So all in all, a disappointment. Not the worst of the year, but it is to me the worst Robin Hood film and quite possibly Ridley Scott's worst film overall too. If you want the definitive Robin Hood, watch the Errol Flynn film, that is simply timeless with plenty of wit, great performances and one of the best scores of all time. 4/10 Bethany Cox",Robin Hood
1,bkoganbing,"""The Runt of the Litter""",6,8 July 2016,"If anyone is expecting a Robin Hood in the style of Errol Flynn or Richard Greene, better forget about it as you start watching this latest incarnation of England's legendary outlaw. Russell Crowe is the latest to try his hand at a much interpreted part. The beauty of playing a fictional character is that you can interpret the protagonist in any way you want. Russell Crowe's interpretation is a brooding revolutionary not satisfied with the status quo. Definitely not happy after returning from the Crusades and seeing the people impoverished from being taxed to pay for a lot of glory hunting foreign wars. Does that ever sound familiar.The action takes place in King John's reign and Oscar Isaac plays him pretty much as history has written. The youngest of Henry II and Eleanor of Acquitaine's children an unpromising lad but who survived to inherit was then the Angevin Empire, England plus a lot of French real estate courtesy of mother. It's a mother complex John has. If my mother referred to me as the runt of the litter, I'd have a jaundiced view myself.Russell Crowe and his posse identified as Little John, Will Scarlett, and Alan-A-Dale inherit the mission of returning Richard's crown after he's been killed in France. Crowe also masquerades as Walter Loxley's son (Max Von Sydow) at his behest lest his daughter-in-law Marian (Cate Blanchett) be dispossessed. Women were chattel at the time having no rights of possession.It's quite true though, John had a lot of people hating him and with a little better luck France could have conquered England back in the day. Here Crowe and his posse help save the realm and unlike other Robin Hood films where King Richard gives him all he can, King John is true to his real character and movie character.It's a different Robin Hood, but Crowe is the medieval hero that so many others on the screen have portrayed. But it's no happily ever after future for him.",Robin Hood
2,Leofwine_draca,When Robin Hood meets Peter Pan,5,13 March 2012,"Having experienced Ridley Scott's two previous historical forays in cinema (GLADIATOR, which I loved, and KINGDOM OF HEAVEN, which I enjoyed), I was eager to see his latest movie, a version of a much-loved legend. The film started off great, with Scott reminding us of his ability to shoot vivid action sequences; the assault on the French castle at the beginning is outstanding. The story begins, tying up the various aspects of the Robin Hood myth – Barnsdale, the Loxley connection, Sherwood Forest, outlawry, Maid Marian – all so far so good. But what was going on with these feral children living out in the woods, wearing voodoo-style sack masks like The Scarecrow from BATMAN BEGINS? The story went on. The political stuff I enjoyed. Mark Strong was a good villain and it was great to see Matthew Macfadyen as the Sheriff of Nottingham, even if he was wasted in the part. Even Russell Crowe's much-derided accent was fairly accurate. But then those feral kids kept creeping in again, even besting our hero in scenes directly inspired by PETER PAN. What on earth have the Lost Boys got to do with Robin Hood? Then I realised – it's to cater to the children's market.My enjoyment diminished. Errors started cropping up, like the cliffs at Dungeness (a notoriously flat stretch of marshland), almost as bad as the out-of-place Hadrian's Wall in ROBIN HOOD: PRINCE OF THIEVES. Then the big beach-bound climatic action set-piece arrived, and boy was I underwhelmed. WW2 D-Day landing craft present in the Middle Ages? That's a new one on me. Maid Marian suddenly donning armour and battling (and defeating) trained French soldiers? Astonishing. Then came the crux – the Lost Boys, on their ponies, taking part in – and helping win – the battle. What a load of twaddle! You can't fault the actors (apart from maybe Cate Blanchett, who's never done ""warm"" in her life and fails as a romantic lead). The action is well handled. The scenery is lovely. The historical inaccuracies are distracting, and the Peter Pan influence a crime, obviously intended to draw females and children to the production. It doesn't work and it is, in fact, a travesty, one that I won't be forgiving Scott for anytime soon. Even the boring bits in KINGDOM OF HEAVEN are better than this.",Robin Hood
3,SnoopyStyle,overly complicated Robin Hood story,5,5 October 2013,"Robin Longstride (Russell Crowe) is fighting along side King Richard the Lionheart as they loot their way back to England from the Crusades. Meanwhile the crown rests on the weak King John. Godfrey wants the French to invade England, and he has infiltrated the king's service as Earl Marshal of England. To further his aim, he destroys many towns to cause chaos in England.There is a lot of complicated story in this one. It is wholly unnecessary to do that. Ridley Scott directs great action scenes, but can't tame this beast of a screenplay. Russell Crowe is solid as Robin. In this shifting and unsteady story, he is the most stable platform. Meanwhile Cate Blanchett is wasted as Marion. She doesn't have enough chemistry for a romance with Crowe.Just when things seem to be reasonably realistic, they send the french invading like D-Day. It doesn't even look good. Ridley could never top movies about the real D-Day no matter what. And he looks ridiculous just for trying.",Robin Hood
4,Prismark10,Robin's arrow,6,3 September 2013,"With a cast courtesy of United Nations and a new take on the Robin Hood legend this can only be a Ridley Scott film.Teaming up once again with Russell Crowe, they embark in retelling this well worn tale.It largely succeeds, Crowe has a wavering accent, dastardly King John looks like a man who is more Mediterranean than English. However with the multinational casting it is unfair to focus on Crowe's accent alone.There is a lot to the film than the usual merry men, mainly because it is an origin story which shows how Crowe becomes Robin Hood.It is to do with identity, betrayal, double dealing and for Robin, redemption and also romance.There is a lot of plot, it can be slow going, but it does lead to an interesting take on the Robin Hood story.The film climaxes on the beach below the cliffs of Dover, with an invasion by the French army.It was well shot and choreographed. It leads to a conclusion that hints that the legend is just about to begin. However there was no follow up sequel.",Robin Hood
5,claudio_carvalho,"A Fraud with the Legend, by Ridley Scott",5,11 September 2010,"I have watched four versions of the legend Robin Hood: the 1938 masterpiece ""The Adventures of Robin Hood"" with Errol Flynn; the excellent 1991 ""Robin Hood: Prince of Thieves"" with Kevin Costner and 1976 ""Robin and Marian"" with Sean Connery; and the good 1991 ""Robin Hood"" made for TV with Patrick Bergin.Ridley Scott decides to reinvent the legend explaining his origins with a grandiose but boring film. The cinematography is wonderful but despite the geographical references,the inaccurate plot is historically flawed and the old and fat Russell Crowe is absolutely miscast; actually he could have been an excellent Friar Tuck. The disembark of the French troops recalls the Normandy Landing of ""Saving Private Ryan"", with the excessive use of computer generated images. Better off watching one of the previous versions again. My vote is five.Title (Brazil): ""Robin Hood""",Robin Hood
6,kosmasp,"Robin Reloaded (or ""RR-rated"")",8,8 October 2010,"Or the beginning or anything else that you see fit as a title. Which should actually make people aware, that this is not the Robin Hood we knew or expected for that matter. But what good would it do, to have another movie that just does the same, that all the other movies did before it (in a Ridley Scott style mind, but still in essence nothing more than the same).I think expectations were not met, by most viewers and even most that knew they were going to get something different, didn't want it to be that different (reviews on IMDb suggest that at well). Of course since we all have different tastes, that is more than logical. I for once liked the approach, and while the movie is anything but flawless (you can always find flaws, this goes back to taste issues again), it is a very dark and down to earth one.The actors are great and many have compared it to Gladiator. I didn't really felt it that way. There might be similarities, but overall this is a different story. So it all boils down to your taste and your expectation of the movie (I have only seen the cut they showed at the cinemas, not the Directors cut that came out on DVD/Blu Ray)",Robin Hood
7,classicsoncall,"""Rise and rise again, until lambs become lions!""",8,4 May 2019,"The movie doesn't seem to be held in high regard by a lot of the reviewers here but I found it entertaining enough; the 6.7 IMDb rating as I write this seems kind of low. With Russell Crowe's presence in the title role, and Ridley Scott directing, the comparisons to ""Gladiator"" are probably to be expected, but I saw more Braveheart in Crowe's performance here than of Gladiator. I haven't particularly been a Robin Hood fan growing up, so I'm not that invested in the character, but I can say that this was a much darker version of the English folklore hero than Errol Flynn's take on the character in 1938's ""The Adventures of Robin Hood"". That movie was brilliantly colorful and displayed an astonishing array of outstanding swordplay, whereas this film dealt more in the political intrigue between England and France, and the fighting sequences were more in tune with audience expectations of the current era. All the names of Sherwood Forest lore are here - Maid Marian, here called Lady Marion (Cate Blanchett), Friar Tuck (Mark Addy), Little John (Kevin Durand), Will Scarlett (Scott Grimes) and the Sheriff of Nottingham (Matthew Macfadyen). One expects a nominal amount of humor from some of the players but it's not overdone in keeping with the overall tone of the picture. There's not a lot here in the tradition of literature's Robin Hood robbing from the rich to give to the poor though the theme is broached in one particular sequence. This story's Robin Hood is more concerned with his fellow men living a life endowed with freedom and liberty, with the picture's final battle meant to insure that outcome, though by the time it's over, the newly crowned King John (Oscar Isaac) reasserts his divine right to tax the poor and declare Robin Hood and his merry men a band of outlaws. It felt like the template for the traditional version of Robin Hood was set right at the end of this picture.",Robin Hood
8,jboothmillard,Robin Hood,4,17 February 2011,"From director Sir Ridley Scott (Alien, Thelma & Louise, Gladiator), this was another one of those films giving us yet another new look into one of the most and constantly re-looked characters, like Dracula and Scrooge before, in this case the hero with the bow and arrows. Basically, set in 13th Century, King Richard the Lionheart (Danny Huston) dies in France, and marauding archer Robin 'of the Hood' Longstride (Russell Crowe), and his band of (merry) men, Little John (Kevin Durand), Will Scarlet (Scott Grimes) and Allan A'Dayle (Alan Doyle) make their way back to England. On the way they encounter the bad guys led by the dastardly Godfrey (Mark Strong), who gets away, and dying knight Sir Robert Loxley (Douglas Hodge) wants Robin to take his sword back to his father in Nottingham. When they arrive, Robin is encouraged by Robert's father Sir Walter Loxley (Max Von Sydow) to pretend to be his son in order to stop the nasty Prince John (Oscar Isaac), taking place as king, taking over the lands. He also encourages him to marry the recently widowed Lady (Maid) Marion Loxley (Cate Blanchett), who Robin may actually have true feelings for, and eventually vice versa. Obviously Prince John is demanding high Royal tax increase, even from the poor people, and it is up to the archers and the armies they have managed to bring together to fight against the corruption. Also starring William Hurt as William Marshal, Eileen Atkins as Eleanor of Aquitaine, Mark Addy as Friar Tuck and Matthew Macfadyen as Sheriff of Nottingham. Crowe was alright, even with an odd slightly Scottish accent, Blanchett was alright as well, there wasn't much of a romantic element, and I did think Isaac made a reasonably vicious villain. I do not remember one scene involving the stealing from the rich, giving to the poor concept, it may have worked better than a film filled with too many dull talking scenes and unnecessarily vast battles, all in all, an average period adventure. Okay!",Robin Hood
9,ma-cortes,Revisionist version based on the legendary character with breathtaking battles and great production values,6,16 August 2011,"Modern rendition with certain revisionism but with load of action and romance .In 13th century England, Robin and his band of marauders confront corruption in a local village and lead an uprising against the crown that will forever alter the balance of world power . Following King Richard (Danny Huston)'s death in France, archer Robin Longstride (Russell Crowe) goes back to England. They find the dying Robert of Locksley (Douglas Hodge), whose party was attacked by a traitor who hopes to facilitate a French invasion of the British Islands by king Philip . Robin promises the dying knight he will go back his sword to his father Walter in Nottingham (Max Von Sidow) . Here Walter encourages him to impersonate the dead man to avoid his territory being confiscated by the crown, and he meets himself with Marian , a ready-made spouse. Meanwhile Sir Godfrey (Michael Strong) worms his way into the king's service as Earl Marshal of England and brutally invades villages under the pretext of collecting Royal taxes . The legendary Sherwood forest's hero Robin Locksly again and Lady Marian (Cate Blanchett) along with his Merrie men brought by Robin from the Crusades : Will Scarlett(Scott Grimes), Friar Tuck (Mark Addy)and Little John (Kevin Durand) facing off a wicked Sheriff of Nottingham (Matthew MacFadyen) . Story is based indirectly on historic events and is developed after third Crusade , Robin is serving in order of Richard Lion Heart(Danny Huston) later the conquering Acre . In route England Richard was captured by Leopold II of Austria and ransomed by his own subjects . Richard attempts to return England to put down a revolt against him but his brother John without Land takes over the kingdom with his underlings Sir Godfrey and Sheriff of Nottingham .The movie has great action sequences well staged with stylish and vitality , adventure , romance and is pretty entertaining . Although is a little revisionist about characters , history and time when is developed the action in a dirty, gritty Middle Age , as spectators generally disapproved the changes of Robin Hood's classic canon . Years later of ¨Gladiator , Kingdom of heaven¨ films , director Ridley Scott and Russell Crowe re-teamed but with much bigger budget . The final product looked as although the actors learn the screenplay and decided the best issue was to take a good time and amuse themselves and both managed to stage some excellent action scenes . Great performances abound , as stalwart Russell Crowe is fine and Cate Blanchett is memorable and attractive , she comes up the film as a valiant and obstinate heroine . Special mention to treacherous Godfrey magnetically performed by Michael Strong and Oscar Isaac as evil and crazed king in a sensationalistic interpretation as Prince John .Despite the critics' complete and utter distaste for the film, I found it fun, well-acted, and fast-paced. There are great action sequences including the battle against an impressive fortress and the final confrontation at the climax of the film. Impeccable but dark cinematography by John Mathieson . Movie is shot on natural sets and English woods , beaches and interior scenarios with impressive production design. Magnificent and spectacular music by Mark Streintfeld. The film is partially based on true events. Although Ivanhoe didn't exist, John Lackland was king of England from 1199 to 1216. Few monarchs have been subject to such appalling publicity as John . Although by no means lovable, he was an able administrator and spent more time in England than his predecessor and elder brother Richard I but he was jailed by Leopold of Austria, returning from Crusades. Being dead king Henry II , then Richard Lionheart was crowned until the third crusade (intervening along with Philip II and vanquished Acre) which was crowned John with no Land . The English domain over France will cause length conflict known the hundred years wars(1339-1453). Besides appears famous knight William Marshall well played by William Hurt . Robin Hood, also known Robin O'Locksley and the Earl of Huntingdom, is probably and sadly a creation of romantic imaginations . If Robin Hood did exist, it's almost certain that he was not a Saxon , though his enemies may well have been the Norman sheriff of Nottinghan and Prince and later king John Lackland. Other versions about this famous personage are the following : ¨Robin Hood price of thieves (1991) ¨ by Kevin Reynolds with Kevin Costner , Alan Rickman and Morgan Freenan , the same year was exhibited ¨Robin Hood¨ by John Irvin with Patrick Bergin and Uma Thurman but was a flop though the critics considered best adaptation. The classic rendition is ¨The adventures of Robin Hood¨ by Michael Curtiz with Errol Flynn and Olivia De Havilland.",Robin Hood
10,Quinoa1984,a revisionist treatment of cinematic folklore - welcome but flawed,6,22 June 2010,"For a film like Robin Hood, which is now like folklore in the movies (or rather a kind of franchise that can be revived every so often depending on who is directing and starring), interpretation is everything. For this new 21st century installment, the director is Ridley Scott. Originally he was going to have a peculiar and original take on the series, which would've been that the Sheriff of Nottingham was more sympathetic and trying to hunt down Robin Hood (or Robin ""of"" the Hood due to his costumes), and that he wasn't such a noble and good guy after all. Sadly, in order to have such a big blockbuster budget and his usual star Russell Crowe compromises had to be made. So what he went with was still a re-imagining of the Robin Hood story- a prequel, if you will, the usual goings on of Robin vs. the Sheriff and his love affair (or really of his life) with Maid Marian- and with his gritty action movie take on things.The action part I can get behind, and it shows; at best the battle and action scenes, and while not rampant when they do happen they are significant and BIG as Scott does, it's exciting and a little brutal. It's not near the power of those scenes that this film is most linked to as a historical drama, which is of course Gladiator (some may also link it to Kingdom of Heaven), but in the scope of quick-but-not-Michae-Bay-quick edits the violence ensues at an entertaining and energetic clip. The problem comes in with tone: Scott may get a gritty and natural look right for Merry Old England circa 12 century, but the joy is lacking. In the Robin Hood movies, even the Kevin Costner one, there's a sense of fun and exhilaration that goes along with such a rogue fighting against the system. It's hard to find that here, except in small doses.Perhaps it's the 'Episode One' format that has this effect, since it's mostly set-up for what will be the eventual sequel. But what story there is is interesting in a kind of revisionist way. Take Richard the Lionhart, for example, as a character who in nearly every Robin Hood story we've seen comes back near the end (i.e. Sean Connery in Prince of Thieves) and saves the day and takes the crown as a proud hero. Here he's a little more closer to how he was (supposed) to be like as the historical king: a little too proud for his own good, and a control freak who would punish anyone who would try and do anything against him. That he also dies early on in the film shouldn't come as a spoiler, since it is so early as to still be set-up. So there is no great hero as we usually know. Another facet of this, once it comes time to Prince-cum-King John to take the throne, he's shown not to be a straightforward tyrant but an insecure younger brother who really likes the idea of being God-given as a King and of course those 'lovely' taxes on the people. Just like a guy imprisoned by power and loving it.The other thing that makes Robin Hood's journey unique is how he meets Marian (Russell Crowe and Cate Blanchett respectively playing the roles the best and believable they know how, or the script allows), and how he finds himself as who he should be. This is a little corny, to be sure, the ""Lambs become Lions"" aspect, but perhaps that's what the film needs. Not always a great touch, especially with hackneyed flashbacks as Robin realizes where he came from by words from Walter Loxley (Max von Sydow, best actor in the film to be sure). But this is another aspect of the film, a good one, that could have used even more elaboration - by the time we really get to know our hero, past being a rogue with his ""Merry"" Men who are mostly awesome archers with a taste for drink, we're already inundated with the political minutia of the story, of British vs. French and how that will play out.Going back to the lack of joy for a moment; a primary note to take is with Mark Strong. An actor who has been possibly typecast for who knows how many years as a villain (just in the past six months Sherlock Holmes and Kick-Ass but many others as well), he has a strong face and bald head to match, but he does very little with the character except go between British and French accents well, and scowl when he needs to out-scowl Crowe. An actor could have been a little more hammy, had some fun with such a dastardly being, but, again, where is the fun in a guy who just wants to kill and maim and has a scar on part of his lip from an arrow sling? While Scott's approach ultimately makes Robin Hood more epic and fascinating on an intellectual level than another director might have achieved, he doesn't really get a heartbeat going with it, at least not until near the end when ""the Legend Begins"".Considering such low expectations (the word of mouth has been bad for a while, with only middling good buzz), the film is a success, though I wonder if it was fully on Scott and Crowe's terms or by compromise with a studio. It's not even a question of there being a director's cut like Scott usually gets with these big films since this 140 minute cut seems complete. A certain something is missing that made its close predecessor, Gladiator, work so wonderfully. Only so much grungy brown/gray hued blood pumps into this one, though more than I would've given it credit for.",Robin Hood
11,michaelRokeefe,This is not your grandfather's Robin Hood.,8,3 May 2017,"Famed director Ridley Scott presents a tale unlike any of the Robin Hood you may know. He is not even referred to as ""Robin of the Hood"" until the film's conclusion. Robin Longstride (Russell Crowe) comes across a dying Sir Robert Loxley (Douglas Hodge)and promises to return the man's sword to his family. Robin will assume the man's identity; romance Loxley's wife, Marion (Cate Blanchett) and manages to really draw the wrath of area outlaws as well as the Sheriff of Nottingham (Matthew Macfadyen).Scott's film actually tells the story of how a man can become Robin Hood and what happens to villages and countries that create such heroes. This is a well made movie with an extremely high level of talent. Well choreographed sequences of action and fighting.Top shelf cast also includes: Max von Sydow, Mark Addy, William Hurt, Oscar Isaac, Danny Huston, Mark Strong, Lea Seydoux, Scott Grimes and Kevin Durand.",Robin Hood
12,hitchcockthelegend,Robin Longstride.,9,15 May 2010,"The Rid and Russ double act re-team once again to tackle the Robin Hood legend that has so often been spun onto the silver screen. With script changes and release dates juggled, the signs weren't leading us to think that this could be anything but an unmitigated failure. Refreshing, then, to find that not only is it a glorious historically bented epic, but also a different spin on the man, the myth and this time in history. For here, along with Brian Helgeland's pen, Messrs Scott & Crowe have made an origin piece about the time before the legend began. Before what we know as the life of the outlaw who frequented Sherwood Forest, his duels with the Sheriff of Nottingham, the band of merry men so steeped in lovable roguish history. This is the time of Robin Longstride and just how did he become known as Loxley. A time of the French marching ominously towards attempted domination of England, a country at war with itself; aided by treasonous parties within the newly formed Kingdom. And of course the time when the burgeoning relationship with the lady Marion would shape what most know as the Robin & Marion story.The historical epic is naturally divisive across the spectrum of cinema lovers. There's just too much demanded from so many different quarters. Think about it, how many historical epics thru history have across the board been lauded? Ben-Hur is possibly the one stand out that most can agree on, but by and large they are few and far between. This Robin Hood will not break the traditional mold of a genre ripped apart for various irks. Be it historical facts, too talky, too dark, even too confusing, the only sure fire thing is that this is guaranteed to annoy as many people as it enthrals. To which I personally can only say that it ticks all the boxes required for a genre piece. It has a supremely tight plot, one that doesn't treat us like MTV watching kiddies, a script that pings with intelligence and awareness, and the action (devoid of CGI overkill) flows and rewards those who have been patiently following the smart layers within the story. Then there is of course the cast to factor into the equation.This is a long way away from Crowe's best performance, but it happens to be one of his most fun. With the swagger and all round hardness of Maximus, combined with the stern, yet affable leadership qualities of Capt. Jack Aubrey, Crowe's Robin is an action hero of some substance, and Crowe plays it as such. He's helped by the casting of his real life pals, Kevin Durand (Little John), Alan Doyle (Allan A'Dayle) and Scott Grimes (Will Scarlet). As easy as it is to accept that Crowe and these boys have many a time really drank tinnies in the sun together, so it be easy to accept these as a group of loyal ""soldiers"" in the film. For real chemistry in cinema look no further. Blanchett is a quality performer, we know that already, here she has to carry the female role of note and does it with a steely edge that is sure to please more than most. Danny Huston (King Richard The Lionheart), Mark Addy (Friar Tuck), Max von Sydow (Sir Walter Loxley) and Eileen Atkins (Eleanor of Aquitaine), each become their respective roles. But it's with a couple of not so well knowns and and old pro where the acting honours should go. William Hurt as William Marshal gives the most assured and believable performance in the film, a real lesson in how to knit the narrative together without resorting to genre compliant ham. Mark Strong as the villainous Godfrey dominates every scene he is in. Britain's best kept secret is now out of the bag and Hollywood has finally woken up to the joys of this wonderfully spoken Londoner. Then there is Oscar Isaac (Prince John), looking like a cross between Sly Stallone and Edmund Blackadder, those in need of an Alan Rickmanesque deliverance of vile campy weasleness need look no further. A real boo hiss bit of sexy involvement.It does have problems of note tho, again one man's meat is another man's poison etc. The accents fluctuate way too much, particularly Crowe's, while Léa Seydoux as Isabella of Angoulême is just awful. She looks too young and acts like a rabbit caught in the headlights, just watch as she tries to hold court with Atkins during a crucial scene, poor indeed. Then there's the score from Marc Streitenfeld, it lacks oomph for the battles and stringy heart pulling emotion for the more tender sequences. This cried out for someone like Hans Zimmer (Gladiator), one has to wonder if Ridley and Hans have fell out because it arguably could have been a match made in (Kingdom Of) Heaven. There's also the issue of blood, or lack of in this case, for as great as the battle constructions are (especially the final beach conflict that plays like a days of yore Saving Private Ryan) there's an absence of ""war is hell"" vibe. The rating compromise all to evident and sure to send, ironically, the younger members of the audience home bored with their blood lust unfulfilled.Gladiator 2? Yeah maybe, perhaps? But that could easily be tagged as lazy journalism since it sure as heck fire finds Crowe & Scott doing wonders for a genre that is always in need of a pick me up. 9/10",Robin Hood
13,LeonLouisRicci,The Dirtying of a Legendary HeroKilling the Charm,6,15 January 2015,"There are Movies that Stand the test of Time, They call those Classics, and then there are Movies that are a Product of their Time. This is a Film that will Not be remembered Kindly. It Drains the Life, not to Mention the Color, from the beloved Legendary Folk Hero and presents Robin Hood as some sort of Missionary, or Soldier on a Mission, or something.But the Fairy Tale is Gone and this rendition is Fairly Facile, relentlessly Bleak, and the look is all Mud and Blood, Gloom and Boom, presented in a Lifeless Template that one assumes is supposed to be ""Realism"". You know, Soap is in Short Supply and Hygiene is Non Existent and Everyone is literally Taxed to Death as They itch and scratch, distracted by All that Dirt. The Charm of the Character is on par with the Charm of The Lone Ranger (2013) which is to say, Charmless. The Film tries to be Historically Semi-Accurate and Myth and Legend be Damned. Just what Audiences Need. Another Grim and Grimy reality check where Heroes are Painted as Nothing more than Strong and Talented Folks and Not Larger than Life.Overall, it is a Gloomy affair this, and Children will most Likely Care Very Little and garner even Less Inspiration from this Ridley Scott-Russell Crowe Dud. As We embark on the New Millennium Our Classic Fictional Characters from Literature and Pop Culture are being Eviscerated one by one. So Robin Hood can join His Vigilante brethren as just another inspirational Role Model Dirtied Up and Brought Down for our Cynical times where Beauty, Grace, and Charm are Redacted and then led Into the Darkness for All to Enjoy.",Robin Hood

Crowe and Blanchett are fish-out-water from the start; where did the Max von Sydow character come from and the others - particularly Oscar Isaac as ""Prince John"" just made me want to curl up with embarrassment. The detail is splendid - as you would expect; but the script is the stuff of a school essay competition and there is just no chemistry here at all.",Robin Hood
15,writers_reign,Hoodwinked,5,14 May 2010,"If anything is in public Domain it is surely the legend of Robin Hood which means that writers/directors are free to reinterpret and/or reinvent the basics to suit themselves, which is just what Ridley Scott has had Brian Helgeland do to a tried-and-true staple. We're light years away from the charm and dash of Errol Flynn, the glorious Technicolor, the great score etc indeed Scott might as well have shot in black and white for all the actual COLOUR on offer. Instead of primary colours we get drab, dull, instead of imaginative Lincoln Green we get gray or washed-out smocks. You'll look in vain for almost anything from the Robin Hood we were weaned on. Instead we get a cynical bowman returning from a ten-year crusade who just happens to be present when Richard the Lionheart gets his and is charged with taking the crown back to England. For good measure, almost immediately he stumbles across Robert Of Loxley, who also got it where the chicken got the axe and prevails on Robin Longstride (for such is our hero's name) to take his own (Loxley's) sword back to his father. This brings in Marion who, far from a maid, is actually the widow of Loxley. And so on. Throw in a heavy, plotting with the French king and there you have it. Cate Blanchett is a fine actress but clearly in this case she was just taking the money and running, presumably to invest it in the theatre she runs with her husband in Sydney. Russell Crowe walks through it as if still searching for the charisma he knows other actors have but until he discovers what it is his search is fruitless. It passes the time but that's about all.",Robin Hood
16,zardoz-13,Saving Private Robin,7,17 May 2010,"Ridley Scott has made several memorable movies. ""Alien,"" ""Black Hawk Down,"" ""Thelma and Louise,"" ""Blade Runner,"" ""Hannibal,"" ""Gladiator,"" and ""American Gangster"" exemplify Scott at his best. Scott's latest movie ""Robin Hood"" resembles ""Gladiator"" with a happy ending. Nevertheless, this early English history lesson grovels alongside Scott's less memorable epics, such as ""Kingdom of Heaven,"" ""The Duelists,"" ""G.I. Jane,"" ""White Squall,"" and ""1492: Conquest of Paradise."" ""A Knight's Tale"" scenarist Brian Helgeland and Scott have reinvented the elusive outlaw archer, and ""Robin Hood"" comprises the folk hero's years before he took up residence in Sherwood Forest. Not surprisingly, this historical spectacle benefits from Scott's meticulous attention to detail and his knack for orchestrating ancient warfare so that it appears no less devastating than its modern counterpart. Arrows are as lethal as missiles. They can kill a man in a heartbeat. An arrow skewering your neck is not a particularly nice way to die.Indeed, Scott interprets the Robin Hood legend somewhat like Anton Fuqua treated the Arthurian legend in his ruggedly realistic ""King Arthur."" One of Scott's regular lensers, John Mathieson of ""Hannibal"" and ""Gladiator,"" makes everything and everybody as beautiful to gaze at as Scott's grubby, authentic approach permits. The verdant countryside sprawls and the sets are fantastic. Scott stages some truly spectacular battle sequences. The French landings are reminiscent—minus the gore—of Steven Spielberg's ""Saving Private Ryan."" These three factors—cinematography, settings, and spectacle--make watching ""Robin Hood"" a tolerable experience. Otherwise, this above-average medieval melodrama wears out its welcome about half way through, and Robin and his 'merry' men have little in common with those from the Errol Flynn or Kevin Costner classics. Russell Crowe plays Robin with a complete lack of charisma. Our hero is an army deserter who masquerades as a knight without shining armor. Unlike previous Robin Hood movies, Maid Marion isn't portrayed as a defenseless damsel-in-distress. She resembles the Keira Knightley heroine Guinevere in ""King Arthur."" Marion suits herself up in armor and cavorts on the field of combat.Basically, ""Robin Hood"" qualifies as a prequel to the legendary adventures of Albion's infamous desperado. Scott and Helgeland have contrived a complicated, often sluggish account that blunders along for 140 dreary minutes with a straight face. The filmmakers try to cover more ground about British history and King John's treachery while they raise Robin from his earthy but noble origins. No, Robin doesn't rob from the rich and provide for the poor. He steals from the church to replenish the lords of the land. The grim action unfolds in war-torn France where Richard the Lionheart (Danny Huston of ""Edge of Darkness"") has one more castle to capture before he comes home bathed in glory from the crusades. Instead, a French cook puts a large arrow through Richard's neck, and the news goes forth that the Lionheart is dead. This bit of history eliminates the final scenes in both the Flynn and Costner ""Robin Hood"" sagas where King Richard returns to grant our hero amnesty. As Robert of Loxley (Douglas Hodge of ""The Descent: Part 2"") is heading toward the French coast with a band of knights to take the king's crown home, traitorous Sir Godfrey (baldheaded Mark Strong of ""Kick Ass""), who has made a pact with the French to kill Richard, ambushes them. Little does Godfrey know that Richard lies dead in a French ditch and the king's trusty knights have only his crown. This doesn't keep Godfrey from killing them all, particularly Robert of Loxley.Meanwhile, Robin and his cohorts have escaped punishment from Richard. It seems Richard wanted to find an Englishman with the courage to tell him the truth about his campaign, and Robin didn't let his monarch down. Robin assures Richard that God would not approve of Richard's crusade. Consequently, Richard orders Robin and company put in stocks. Now that Richard is dead, Robin and his men escape and ride hell-bent-for-leather toward the coast to beat the retreating British Army. Robin discovers Godfrey's ambush and Robin's men fill the ambushers with arrows. Godfrey barely escapes but not before Robin marks him on the corner of the mouth with an arrow. The dying Robert begs Robin to return his sword to his father-in-law. Robin and his men decide to masquerade as knights to return the crown. Miraculously, nobody exposes Robin and company as impostors as they land and witness John being crowned the new King of England. Afterward, Robin rides off to Nottingham to return Sir Walter's sword. Meantime, King John (Oscar Isaac of ""The Nativity Story"") dispatches Godfrey to collect taxes from the destitute Northern barons to fill his empty treasury. In Nottingham, Robin returns Robert's sword to Sir Walter Loxley (Max von Sydow of ""The Exorcist""), but Walter is old and blind. Nevertheless, Walter decides to stage a masquerade of his own and announces that his son-in-law Robert has returned. Essentially, Walter makes Robin his son-in-law so that Marion Loxley (Cate Blanchett of ""Elizabeth: The Golden Age"") can keep his estate.Eventually, William Marshal (William Hurt of ""The Incredible Hulk"") learns about Godfrey's betrayal of Britain and struggles to convince King John that Philip of France is about to land an army on the coast. Robin, the rebellious barons, and the King unite against a common enemy to repulse the French invasion that Scott recreates as if it were the D-Day landing at Normandy in ""Saving Private Ryan."" The romance between Marion and Robin kindles few sparks. The battle sequences look terrific, but they seem to go on forever like ""Robin Hood."" At the end, King John celebrates victory, refuses to sign the Magna Carta, and makes Robin an outlaw. Despite Scott's best intentions to treat the legendary archer with more authenticity than earlier movies and television series, ""Robin Hood"" blows its historicity in the big invasion when Marion slaps on armor and leads a regiment of ill-clad orphans on ponies at the French.",Robin Hood
17,TBJCSKCNRRQTreviews,"Bold, well-done",7,14 May 2010,"This is a reinterpretation of the legend; I personally think we were due such. We've had plenty of reiterations of the widely accepted version(with that said, I haven't watched many of the movies; I can imagine the Flynn one to be one of the greatest), and, well, that's one of the two things we do with stories like that, we retell and we alter them, the latter usually leaving the mark(for better or worse) of the period in which it was changed. While I have not yet seen Gladiator, I can see a resemblance to what I've heard about it, and I agree that it does hurt the result; this does not feel as satisfying or self-contained as it could and should. Not all the plot lines and themes pay off. Other than that, I can think of relatively little to complain about; I do want to address what several have been saying, that there is not much action(especially early on). I disagree, I'd say there's a nice amount throughout, albeit it does not tend to last very long. The battle sequences are cool, with moments of awesomeness. This is exciting, and the camera-work sometimes puts you right in the middle of fights and the like. The editing and cinematography are marvelous, with grand, epic shots as well as the single most beautifully photographed firing of an arrow I've ever seen. At parts of this, I was reminded of Kingdom of Heaven. This has a lot of realism and is quite authentic, and they wrote in actual historic events(from the time this is set) that I haven't heard of being connected with Mr. Hood before. The sense of humor is largely good, with few jokes falling flat. I didn't think that this was excessively somber, although it could be clearer in what it wants to be. Russell could be argued as being too old, but he's certainly fit enough. I don't think the script was harmed by the rewrites. The cast is marvelous(Mark Strong being in this made me look forward to it all the more), and everyone delivers a stellar performance. Blanchett gives Marian a willpower and independence not seen before. The tone is gritty. This has a fairly solid pace; I was not bored at any point of it, if it's not all fast. One can tell Ridley's considerable cinematic talent, even if this is not his best. There is plenty of moderate(occasionally graphic and bloody) violence and disturbing content, brief sexual visual(no nudity) references and infrequent mild language in this. I recommend this to fans of those who made it and/or the source material(provided you don't mind it not being like you remember it). 7/10",Robin Hood

Ridley Scott's epic origin story of the legendary folk hero gets a big boost/re-boot for the 21st Century with Crowe as the archer/soldier who decides to fight the establishment (read : King John) and right the wrongs in the process. While the action sequences suggest ""Saving Private Ryan"" meets ""Braveheart"" and the echoes of Scott/Crowe's ""Gladiator"" it still stands on it s own merits largely thanks to a streamlined script by Brian Helgeland and some impressive set pieces (and a fine ensemble particularly a fierce Blanchett as Maid Marian) leading to a new franchise to explore the robber-of-the-rich-and-giver-to-the-poor.",Robin Hood
19,neil-476,Not a brilliant battle plan in my opinion... ...but the film's good anyway,8,12 May 2010,"Ridley Scott's take on the old familiar story is mistitled - called simply ""Robin Hood"", it should be called ""Robin Hood - The Origin."" The film finishes with the stage finally being set for the Robin Hood story we are familiar with.And that's one of the reasons why I really enjoyed this movie - I had no idea where it was going, and I was constantly interested as a result.I'll be brief. The film looks great - very convincingly mediaeval. Even sequences which must have been effects shots didn't look like it. The performances from a large and starry cast were all excellent, even if some of the accents were a touch uncertain. The story was always interesting, the script was workmanlike if not sparkling. And the action set-pieces were well staged.On that note, though, I have to spoiler one major hole - the battle strategy for the French invasion, noted by King John as being a good plan, was actually about the worst plan possible. The French had chosen to land on a beach overlooked by cliffs with a single track leading off, and rocks at either end. The obvious strategy was to position English archers along the cliff top raining arrows down, which they did, and then hold the other forces at the top of the track to slaughter any French who tried to make their way, maximum 4 abreast, through the narrow exit (it worked for the 300). But no, let's gallop everyone down to the beach and charge. Duh.And while we're at it, where would Marion have learned to fight like a knight while wearing full chain mail?",Robin Hood
20,ferguson-6,The not so merry men of the Hood,6,20 May 2010,"Greetings again from the darkness. Hard to argue with the box office success when director Ridley Scott teams up with Russell Crowe (Gladiator, American Gangster). Can't really challenge the resume of writer Bryan Helgeland or the acting chops of Cate Blanchett, Max von Sydow or William Hurt. And only the most cynical would deny the appeal of the Robin Hood legend ... stealing from the rich to give to the poor. So why is it that I feel so cheated and let down by this version?First of all, it is presented as a prequel to the legend. This is the story of how Robin and his band of merry men (and Maid Marion) came to be united. If it is a prequel, why then is Robin (Russell Crowe) so darn old? There is even a line in the film noting the advanced age of King Richard the Lionheart being 40 or even more! For the times, this was considered old, yet somehow Robin is ready for a career change.The best parts of the film are the amazing sets and pieces - both the villages and the boats. And we all know that Mr. Scott can film a massive battle scene! There is a touch of Gladiator, Saving Private Ryan and Braveheart in many scenes. All fine, but what I really missed was the flirtatious banter between Robin and Marion. Maybe I am biased, but a Lorena Bobbitt threat doesn't strike me as light-hearted bed chamber conversation.My biggest complaint is with the script. It just felt clunky and messy. A couple of scenes were apparently included just so Mark Strong could scowl ... and he has a great scowl! Other scenes and lines were seemingly included just to give the film a complex feel. Probably too complex for what it really is.Oscar Isaac as Prince John was the funniest and most interesting character in the film. The preview made him look like a buffoon, but the film gave him more depth ... and a couple of great lines. Danny Huston as Lionheart, Mark Addy as Friar Tuck and Matthew Macfadyen as the Sheriff of Nottingham all add to the luster, but remember this is prior to Robin's ongoing battles with the Sheriff.Be cautious with younger kids as it is a strong PG-13. The battle scenes are entertaining, but this is one legend that did not need its roots exposed.",Robin Hood
21,HotToastyRag,Battle after battle after battle,6,7 February 2021,"I avoided the 2010 Robin Hood because of the rumor that it was too violent, and why watch a Russell Crowe movie if he has a bad haircut? Now that it's Cate Blanchett week at Hot Toasty Rag, I decided to rent it. Although she does play Maid Marion, the story in this version is quite different; she's not exactly ""maid"" Marion. She's married!In this version, the film takes us through the origin of Robin Hood's band of merry men - but it takes a while to get there. This is a very long movie, and the first hour is battle upon battle upon battle. Marion remains in the village waiting for her husband and caring for her blind father-in-law, Max von Sydow. When Prince John (played by Oscar Isaac) gets put into power, his head bad guy (Mark Strong) heads into battle again. Robin finally falls into company with Friar Tuck (Mark Addy), Little John (Kevin Durand), and Wil Scarlet (Scott Grimes). In this version, the Sheriff of Nottingham (Matthew Macfadyen) is not featured nearly as prominently as the other bad guys.However are Robin and Marion going to meet, let alone get together? When her husband dies and asks Robin to visit his family and present his sword to his father, Robin gets to travel to the village. Anyone who rented this movie to see a romantic version is in for a disappointment. There are a few flirty glances, but that's about it. This movie is far more about the fighting than the humor and romance, like other versions. You'll see lots of familiar faces, though, including William Hurt, Eileen Atkins, and Danny Huston. But if you're a Max von Sydow fan, you might not want to rent it - or at least keep your fast-forward button handy, like I did.",Robin Hood
22,Wuchakk,Most realistic version of the Medieval hero,6,28 July 2013,"Ridley Scott is a master filmmaker as far as look, feel and sound go, but I typically find myself sort of detached from his adventure epics (e.g. ""Gladiator"", ""Kingdom of Heaven"" and ""1492: Conquest of Paradise""). Don't get me wrong, I enjoy them, but the storytelling keeps me at a distance. Since he's not a writer, maybe it's the screenwriter's fault, who knows? Anyway, ""Robin Hood"" (2010) struck me the same way, but not as much, particularly the first half.The film focuses on how Robin of Locksley became Robin the hood. You could say it's a prequel to other film versions of the character. What's strange about this being a prequel is that Robin (Russell Crowe) is clearly in his mid-40s, which means he doesn't even become Robin Hood until his mid-to-late 40s. Cate Blanchett who plays Maid Marion was 40 during filming, not a spring chicken either; and decidedly grim. I have no problem with an older Robin Hood, but don't expect him to have the acrobatic daring-do of, say, Errol Flynn's depiction (who was only 28 when the classic ""The Adventures of Robin Hood"" was shot).In any case, ""Robin Hood"" strikes me as the most realistic version of the character and his medieval setting. Kevin Costner's version from 1991 was generally realistic too, but Rickman's Sheriff of Nottingham gave the film a campy edge (albeit entertaining) and there was some eye-rolling witchcraft dabblings as well (not that some people didn't practice witchcraft back then, but it just came off cartooney). Both of these versions are in contrast to Errol Flynn's approach to the character, who displayed a blatant joie de vivre (""joy of living"") and superhuman heroics. I enjoy all three takes, but none of them are great. Despite the shortcomings of Costner's version it somehow reached iconic status, something of which this version won't ever attain. As noted above, the first half is a promising foundation, but the second half drops the ball as far as engaging storytelling goes. Still, the climatic battle sequence on the coast is visually spectacular and second to none. The film was shot in England & Wales and runs 141 minutes (theatrical cut) and 156 minutes (director's cut). The DVD has both versions and I viewed the latter.GRADE: B-",Robin Hood
23,gradyharp,An Historian's View of the Traditional Character,8,23 September 2010,"ROBIN HOOD is a solid movie; it is less on the Errol Flynn format than most people expected and more on setting up the background for the blossoming of the infamous Robin Hood, and if the last few minutes of the film can be believed, there is likely a sequel in the mind of Ridley Scott! Once the audience accepts the fact that they are not in store for film about a happy-go-lucky thief who robs form the rich to pay the poor then this film settles into a fine examination of the corrupt government of England, barely surviving during King Richard the Lionheart's (Danny Huston) 10 year absence in the Crusades. We see the state of the Church, the presence of espionage and greed that depletes the people of England with high taxes and confiscation of land and food and seed to plant. It is a sad state of affairs with only a few strongholds of honesty and survival - focused here on Nottingham, governed by the blind Sir Walter Loxley (Max von Sydow) and his daughter Marion (Cate Blanchett), the young boys having taken to the forest as feral huntsmen, and whose grain houses are pilfered to the point of starvation. Along comes Robin Longstride (Russell Crowe) who has been asked by the dying king to deliver his crown to the Queen (Eileen Atkins), which in turn makes his smarmy brother John (Oscar Isaac) the new king. One evil treacherous Godfrey (Mark Strong, the Hollywood movies' requisite bad guy) wiles his way into the good graces of King John, ostensibly replacing the court adviser William Marshall (William Hurt) and planning for the destruction of Robin Longstride. Meanwhile Robin takes refuge with the Loxley household, being named 'husband' of the widowed Marion for protection. The remainder of this very long film is about Robin's learning about his heritage, his participation in squelching the Normandy Invasion, his gathering of his loyal merry men - Friar Tuck (Mark Addy), Little John (Kevin Durand), Will Scarlet (Scott Grimes) and Allan A'Dayle (Alan Doyle) - becoming Robin Hood, his teaching the feral boys of the forest how to fight, and his falling in love with Marion, all under the watchful eyes of the Sheriff of Nottingham (Matthew Macfayden) and Godfrey. All's well that end's well and let's hope that screenwriter Brian Helgeland has a sequel ready to start filming with Ridley Scott! The scenery is beautiful when it is not all muddy and overcast and John Mathiesen has captured the flavor of 12th century England well. Marc Streitenfeld composed the score that is for the most part embarrassingly unremarkable. One of the finest aspects of the film can be attributed to Ron Diamond who is in charge of the terrific art of the opening and closing titles - really fine art work and animation. It is a mature person's ROBIN HOOD - and it works very well! Grady Harp",Robin Hood
24,DICK STEEL,A Nutshell Review: Robin Hood,10,13 May 2010,"My experience with the cinematic legend of Robin Hood is just modestly made up of clips from the Errol Flynn film, and that of the Prince of Thieves directed by Kevin Reynolds and starring Hollywood's It kid at that 90s moment Kevin Costner, a film memorable only for its Bryan Adams ballad that played during the end credits, Alan Rickman as a hammed version of the Sheriff of Nottingham, and that American accent. Then there's Disney's foxy animation, Sean Connery's veteran Robin Hood and Maid Marian that I caught on television, and a made-for-TV movie that hit the screens here titled Robin Hood with Patrick Bergin in the titular role, and Uma Thurman as a feisty Maid Marian.The thing with legends is that there's enough bandwidth for different interpretations because there can be nothing definitive about it other than the underlying concept, which to the mythos is Robin of the Hood and his Merry Men's robbing of the rich to give to the poor, who have to put up with ever increasing taxes in England as ruled by well, an unpopular king whose identity depends on where the tale is set. In Brian Helgeland's story, it takes on epic proportions of political intrigue involving betrayal in the English court and a French king ever looking to conquer the English Isles through an insider set to incite an uprising and civil war before crossing the Channel with an army, and in some ways the opening resembles Ridley Scott's film of 10 years ago, Gladiator, which also starred Russell Crowe.Beginning with one of the limited action sequences in the film (yes it's true this film's more talk than action), the premise can also be considered to follow up directly from Scott's earlier effort Kingdom of Heaven, which dealt with the Crusades. Here, King Richard the Lionheart (Danny Huston) is leading his knights back on a retreat to England to reclaim his throne, and amongst his soldiering ranks are archers Robin Longstride (Crowe) and his men Will Scarlet (Scott Grimes), Allan A'Dayle (Alan Doyle) and Little John (Kevin Durand) with whom Robin befriends through a sleight of hand game, rather than the iconic meeting in Sherwood Forest through a challenge of skills at a river.And like the Gladiator format, we see how Robin steps up to assist in the capture of castles and land, before a new coronation takes place which spells trouble eventually for Longstride as he goes up against a jealous monarch, who condemns Robin Hood's to an outlaw status in due course. But in the meantime, Robin Longstride decides to abandon the erratic King Richard, and not before long will stumble upon the mentioned huge conspiracy against his country. So it's up to the reluctant hero and his men to interfere and interrupt corrupt regimes with the very glossing of that involving religious leaders, plus crossing swords with chief villain and friend of Prince John (Oscar Isaac), Godfrey (Mark Strong).So where's the usual nemesis the Sheriff of Nottingham (Matthew Macfadyen) you may say? He's still featured in the film albeit in a smaller role, and Helgeland's story being set in the formative years of Robin Hood means whatever we know of Sherwood Forest and the adventures of Robin and his Merry Men, has not even begun yet. This allows for Ridley Scott to bring his vision of the sword and sandals epic and apply it on this English legend and I think probably the first to feature the skilled archer using a warhammer charging into battle. Expect violence, though most happen off-screen. Compared to the last big budgeted Robin Hood film Prince of Thieves, Ridley Scott's vision and version is a lot grittier, with so much dirt and grim in every scene to highlight the impoverished conditions in the aftermath of the much funded Crusades, that it makes the other version look like a romp through a forested theme park with fancy pulley-lift rides.Scott and Crowe is one of the enduring director-actor partnerships in Hollywood these days with this film marking the director's fourth consecutive collaboration (A Good Year, American Gangster, Body of Lies and this) with Crowe, who seemed a little pudgy as a much older man in tights, though the finale did make him look the part a lot more. Since this is something of an origin story in itself, we see very little of his interaction with his motley crew which leaves plenty of room to do so in a follow up film, and the focus is on establishing Robin Longstride as a hero, exploring his past, and his romance with the widow (gasp!) Maid Marian, played by Cate Blanchett.Yes, Maid Marion's married, and possesses plenty of spunk just like Uma Thurman's 1991 version, and a tinge like Eowyn from Lord of the Rings who's equally adapt with armours and weapons in battle. The Sheriff of Nottingham takes a backseat in the hall of infamy, and Mark Strong steps into the villainous lead, cementing himself as a dangerous stereotype in playing evil characters, here as an adviser who exploits the name of King John to stir trouble, dressed in a billowing black cape like Darth Vader, and has a half Joker-ish scarred mouth no thanks to Robin Hood. Oscar Isaac almost steals the show toward the end with his desperately comical turn as a King under siege, and luminaries such as William Hurt and Max von Sydow complete the star-studded lineup.And whatever you do, don't shortchange yourself by walking out of the cinema hall when the end credits start to play - you're treated to a stunning animated (and bloody too I may add) sequence that recounts the last 2 hours in reverse chronological order ending with the Crusades, and what more, aurally enjoy the hauntingly beautiful music by Marc Streitenfeld as well.",Robin Hood
25,siderite,"Nothing too great, but unexpectedly good",8,4 October 2010,"I was expecting a really bad movie. A ""reinvention"" of Robin Hood's story, one that is ""more real"", but also watchable by today's audience. It sounded like a joke... How can you theater famine, filth, rape and gore, all with a backdrop of nobles considering lowborns less than cattle? Well, you can't. So the story is still mainly a silly romantic, filled with brave, honest and ultimately naive Englishmen, but it is less silly than previous Robin Hood incarnations. It is what one might call a prequel to the well known story, one that involves court machinations, despotic kings, French invasions and some level of mild violence. Even the villain feels real, even if still a bit cartoonish.Bottom line: an easy to watch film, with good directing and acting and with a surprisingly (given my expectations) good script. Beware, though, it lasts for two and a half hours.",Robin Hood
26,namashi_1,A Terrific Letdown!,4,25 September 2010,"Ridley Scott is one of the most talented filmmakers to have stepped in Filmdom. His knowledge about films is prolific, and something to take home. 'Robin Hood', which is one of the most expensive films to hit the Silver-Screen this year, ranks amongst the filmmakers laziest and weakest efforts to date.The Legend of Robin Hood, should be a inspiring tale. A Hero who became a part of History, unfolds boringly in those 141 minutes. The cinematography is of Masterpiece Standards, but the writing, at most places, lacks the bite. Ridley Scott is not in form this time. 'Legend', 'Body Of Lies' and 'Robin Hood' are his weakest efforts to date. John Mathieson's Cinematography, as mentioned, is a pure eye-pleasure. One of the finest lens-man in the Filmdom today! Brian Helgeland's Screenplay, is rather a dose than being a tribute to the hero.Performance-Wise: Russell Crowe as Robin Hood, is passable. The craze of the 'Gladiator' is not visible in Robin Hood. William Hurt is superb. He steals the show. Cate Blanchett is, as always, good. Mark Strong hams. He appears so mechanical. Oscar Isaac is average. On the whole, the legend of this hero doesn't work. A Terrific Letdown!",Robin Hood
27,JamesHitchcock,"The Epic, the Heroic and the Mythical",8,7 March 2015,"The traditional legend of Robin Hood, at least in the form into which it had evolved by the nineteenth or early twentieth century, generally runs as follows. Robin is a Saxon nobleman, either the Earl of Huntingdon or Sir Robert Loxley or Locksley, who in the reign of Richard I is unjustly outlawed for some crime he did not commit. He flees into Sherwood Forest, an area of dense woodland near Nottingham, where he joins forces with the ""Merry Men"", a like-minded group of outlaws. Robin and the Merry Men together stand up for the rights of the Saxon peasantry who are suffering under a burden of heavy taxation imposed by their Norman overlords, and ""rob the rich to give to the poor"". Robin's principal enemies are Prince John (who is scheming to usurp the crown from his brother), the Sheriff of Nottingham and Sir Guy of Gisborne, an arrogant Norman noble. His love interest is Maid Marian, normally portrayed as a Norman lady who has taken the cause of the downtrodden Saxons against her own people. This version of the legend was faithfully followed in the famous 1938 film with Errol Flynn, but more recent adaptations have departed from it somewhat. The 1991 Kevin Costner vehicle ""Robin Hood: Prince of Thieves"", for example, dispensed with Gisborne and Prince John and made the Sheriff Robin's sole antagonist. The version with Patrick Bergin, also from 1991, made the main villain one Miles Folcanet. This latest version, however, departs from the traditional story more radically. It has some points in common with ""Robin and Marian"" from 1976. In both films Robin (here named Robin Longstride) is not an aristocrat but a common archer in King Richard's army. In both films Richard (who is not shown in a very good light in either) is killed early on while besieging Chalus Castle, which means that the main action takes place during John's reign. In this version, although Robin is a commoner, upon his return to England he adopts (for reasons too complex to explain) the identity of a dead knight, Sir Robert Loxley; Marian is here the widow of the real Loxley and finds herself falling for the man who has assumed her husband's identity. Although John proves to be a bad king, he is not the main villain of the story. Indeed, Robin is forced to make common cause with John to thwart an invasion of England by King Philip of France. The Sheriff appears, but is a minor figure; the real villain is Sir Godfrey, a treacherous English nobleman in league with the French. (This storyline struck me as being too much influenced by modern notions of patriotism. In the early 13th century the English royal family, and most of the nobility, were of Norman-French origins and spoke French as their mother tongue. They would not necessarily have objected to a French monarch; indeed, when many of the barons rebelled against John later in his reign they proclaimed Philip's son Louis King of England). The film has been criticised for lack of historical accuracy, but this seems a strange criticism of a film centred upon a legendary character who in all probability had no historical existence. In one respect, however, Scott was aiming at historical realism. The 1938 film (and to some extent the Costner version) gives us a cheerful, colourful and somewhat sanitised view of life in a fantasy ""Merrie England"". This film, in common with the Patrick Bergin version, gives us a much grimmer, darker and dirtier Middle Ages, no doubt on the basis that if one is making a film about a mediaeval peasants' revolt one should show something of the conditions against which the peasants are revolting. Scott is one of the few modern directors- Peter Jackson is another- who can convincingly convey a sense of the epic, the heroic and the mythical. He came badly unstuck when he tried to create his own original mythos in ""Legend"", but he has succeeded to a greater extent when he has stuck closer to historical reality, as in ""Gladiator"" or his other mediaeval epic ""Kingdom of Heaven"", or to existing legends as in ""Exodus"". In order to do this he needs a leading actor with a similar ability and has found one in Russell Crowe, the star of ""Gladiator"" who has collaborated with him on a number of films. Crowe's ability is not just a matter of formal acting skills, although he certainly possesses those, but also of things which cannot be taught at drama school, such as the presence, stature and charisma to portray successfully heroic figures of history or legend. Of the other actors the one who stood out was Crowe's fellow-Australian Cate Blanchett as Marian. This story is not the traditional legend, and in 2010 some critics disliked it for that; David Roark, for example, said that Scott had ""sucked the life out of a cherished fable"", and Roger Ebert criticised him in similar terms. I think, however, that Scott had the ambition to do something original, not merely to direct a belated remake of the 1938 film. His film may diverge from what we have come to regard as the Robin Hood legend, but it remains true to its spirit in its depiction of the fight of the common man against oppression and injustice. The Errol Flynn version set the bar very high, and in my opinion remains the best ""Robin Hood"" to this day. Scott's film, however, is probably its closest challenger, coming just ahead of ""Prince of Thieves"". 8/10 A goof. Loxley's home is in the village of Peper Harow, in the film obviously close to Nottingham. In reality Peper Harow is near Godalming in Surrey, some 150 miles from Nottingham.",Robin Hood
28,Smells_Like_Cheese,Robin Hood ain't so good,3,15 May 2010,"Ah, Robin Hood, Robin Hood, Robin Hood. What can I say about this movie other than disappointment? I was so beyond excited to see this movie, I love the story of Robin Hood. I've seen the movies, read the books, seen documentaries on this incredible legend. Well, who knows what's true as there are so many stories. The more famous movies stay with the common story: Robin Hood steals from rich, gives to poor, falls in love with Maid Marian, stops the evil Sheriff and Prince John and saves the day. Simple enough story, but it always brings in the adventure. So I can understand with this Robin Hood, kudos for trying something different, but this was definitely the more boring story of Robin Hood. It's not even really about him, but more so how he became Robin Hood. Also I don't think Ridley Scott had any problem with ripping off any other war movie, I saw Saving Private Ryan, Brave Heart and Gladiator in this film. The editing was way out of control and was too much on the eyes. The story is also confusing as heck to the point where I really didn't care any more and started to doze off.Robin Longstride is a common archer in the Third Crusade. Following the death of Richard the Lionheart in battle, Robin and three other common soldiers attempt to return to their homeland, having spent ten years fighting abroad. Along the way they come across an ambush of the King's guard by Sir Godfrey; an English Knight with French lineage. The King of France had ordered Sir Godfrey to assassinate Richard. Having discovered the King is already slain Sir Godfrey is chased off by the arrival of Robin and his companions. Aiming to return to England safely and richer in pocket than they left it Robin and his men steal the armour of the slain Knights and head for the English ships on the coast under the guise of noblemen. Upon arrival in England, Robin is chosen to inform the Royal family of the King's death and witnesses the crowning of King John. The arrogant King John shows no remorse to his poor Kingdom and demands harsh taxes to be collected, sending Sir Godfrey off to the North with the task of raising revenue. Despite King John's jealousy, he asks Robin for his help in defeating the French and saving England.I don't mean to be so down on the film, it was just too long, too over written and missed the whole point of a Robin Hood story. This felt like a war film that just happened to have the character Robin Hood in it. I still can't see Russell Crowe as Robin Hood honestly, I think the crown will always be held by Errol Flynn, he had a sense of adventure, humor and everyone adored him. I even found Cary Elwes to be a more believable Robin Hood; heck, Kevin Costner was a more likable Robin Hood, I don't care what people say about his accent. Plus, Sheriff of Nottingham was pretty much non existent and was not threatening in any way. The only actor who seemed to put any effort into his part was Oscar Isaac who played Prince John, he brought everything he had to the script and played the part very well. Even Max Von Sydow seemed bored with his role, he must have owed Ridley Scott a favor. I want you to understand, I really wanted to love this movie, I was so excited for it and was really rooting for it to knock all the other Robin Hood's out of the park, but it failed in a lot of ways. I hope that if they do a sequel, they work on the script, stick with the safety net: Robin Hood is a good guy who helps the helpless, saves the girl and rocks Nottingham. Cheesy, simple, but always classic and fun.3/10",Robin Hood
29,Rainey-Dawn,A Refreshingly Good Robin Hood Tale,9,3 July 2014,"A great story of Robin Hood. I had no problems with variations with the story from books or other various films about the legendary character. It's a different viewpoint entirely and I like that because I am not watching another remake of an earlier movie version about Robin Hood (although I enjoy most of those movies too).To compare ""Robin Hood"" to ""Gladiator"" is like comparing ""Robin Hood"" to ""A Beautiful Mind"" just because Russell Crow is starring in the film. One has to compare apples to apples and not apples to oranges - two completely different fruits and completely different types of movies all together.Robin Hood (2010) is a great film.

Not only is it boring sometimes, it doesn't feel like a Robin Hood movie and I don't mean that in a good way either, even if it's about Robin Hood's origin and how he became a mischievous thief. And even if Russell Crowe is a great actor in some of his films, this role really wasn't for him, actually it doesn't make a difference cause this film really doesn't feel like a Robin Hood movie. He is some chain mail wearing barbarian that is a bit of a bad ass instead of the cool mischievous Robin that he is known for, and the film is just boring at times although it does have it's moments it really isn't that great. And what is really sad is how the film budget is $237 million, and it's sad to see a movie that cost that much turned out to be not that good and doesn't even feel like a Robin Hood movie.6.8/10",Robin Hood
31,sddavis63,A Very Dark And Different Take On A Familiar Story,8,30 August 2011,"This is not exactly Robin and his merry men, nor is this Errol Flynn swashbuckling and laughing his way through merry old England as he gets his jollies battling the sheriff of Nottingham. No, this particular take on the story of Robin Hood is very different - like none you've ever seen before. Even the historical setting is changed from what's usually offered. Here, rather than waiting out the evil regency of Prince John and his minions until King Richard returns from the Crusades, Richard is already dead. His death comes very early on in the movie in battle in France. John is the King of England in this movie, and rather than an unselfish ""robbing the rich to give to the poor"" type character, Robin (actually in this movie Robin Longstride, who finds himself impersonating Robert of Locksley and becomes known as ""Robin of the Hood"") is a more complex character. I wouldn't say exactly noble - especially in the beginning - and his battle is not so much for the poor as it's a battle for the ""rights"" of the English people, as he eventually takes on what seems to be the fight to get John to sign what I assume is Magna Carta, and at least temporarily has to ally himself with John to help lead the defence of England against a French invasion.The different historical setting is a bit disorienting to be honest - especially at first - but it also gives a degree of unpredictability to what's going to happen, and once you get a sense of where you are, when you are and what the fight is about it's easy enough to understand what's going on. Russell Crowe did a commendable job, I thought, in this alternate portrayal of Robin, and Cate Blanchett was most certainly a different kind of Marion. She's not the Maid Marion of legend. She's tough, she's a fighter, she goes into battle with the French - although not leading the battle, there's almost a Joan of Arc quality to her (minus the voice of God.) I was quite taken with Oscar Isaac as King John. He took the part and made it real. John came across as I would expect him to from the historical record - shifty and conniving, untrustworthy, quite willing to make and break whatever alliances are necessary at any given moment to ensure his survival as King and sometimes quite befuddled by his responsibilities. Perhaps a weakness was the fact that there was no real focus on Robin's men. Really only Will Scarlett (played by Scott Grimes) and Friar Tuck (played by Mark Addy) were significant elements in the story, and even they weren't particularly important.The sets and setting were good. This felt like I imagine England in the late 12th-early 13th centuries would have felt like. Rough, brutal, dirty. It worked for me. The battle scenes (and there are a lot of them) are very well done. Since the movie ends with the caption ""And so the legend begins"" one wonders if a sequel might be in the works, perhaps detailing the struggle leading up to the actually signing of Magna Carta? If so, I'd definitely watch it. This was quite good! (8/10)",Robin Hood
32,Hellmant,No robbing from the rich and giving to the poor!,7,14 October 2010,"'ROBIN HOOD': Three and a Half Stars (Out of Five) A prequel to the legendary 'Robin Hood' story everyone knows, an origins tale that leads up to the mythical Robin Longstride (played impressively by Russell Crowe) becoming the famous outlaw. It tells of his days as an expert archer in King Richard The Lionheart's (played by Danny Huston) army during the Third Crusade. When the King is killed and his brother Prince John (played by Oscar Isaac) takes over the bankrupt kingdom he resorts to corrupt tactics in order to rebuild it. Robin, with his army buddies Little John (played by Kevin Durand) and Will Scarlet (played by Scott Grimes), travels to Nottingham and takes the identity of a dead knight, Sir Robert Loxley (played by Douglas Hodge). There he falls for Loxley's wife (played by the always impressive Cate Blanchett) and clashes with the new King before leading the towns folk to aid him in fighting off a French invasion.There's no robbing from the rich and giving to the poor and he doesn't become an outlaw until the last five minutes of the movie. This was a total surprise to me having seen the cleverly deceitful trailers which contain several scenes from the last five minutes of the movie. The movie is described as a much more realistic and accurate portrayal of how the real man who inspired the myth became known as a legend but I've read one expert's opinion (David Crook) who disagrees. He says in reality the myth came from gossip about an average crook who benefited from Yorkshire's lawlessness in the 1220's.The movie itself is obviously a lot less romanticized and more gritty and serious than any previous versions but it's also a lot less fun. There's some decent acting and directing, from epic action master Ridley Scott, as well as some pretty impressive battle scenes but the script is too all over the place and therefor not as interesting. A decent action movie but not nearly as memorable as some of the other classic tellings of the adventures of Robin Hood.Watch our movie review show 'MOVIE TALK' at http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B8w-4xZ94ZU",Robin Hood
33,Robert_duder,"Take a tired idea and give it new life, and a new spin...not an easy accomplishment",8,19 July 2010,"Robin Hood came into theatres with very mixed feelings from all sorts of areas. Some call it a solid period piece and others still (maybe the majority) seem to be very sceptical about the whole thing harping on both Russell Crowe and Ridley Scott and making obvious comparisons to Gladiator. I personally think that is absurd. Plenty of great actors have worked with the same directors and made similar films even. But Robin Hood and his world, and Gladiator are about as different as apples and steak. I don't know how many film iterations of Robin Hood there has been but it has to be dozens, probably over a hundred. So I think Ridley Scott and anyone else who created this particular outing. They managed to take the characters we all know and love and actually make something entirely unique and give us another side to the beloved character. Nothing from the film other than the characters was familiar to me and I've loved Robin Hood since I was a boy. The film isn't heavy on action and relies more so on the legendary characters and the origins of the hero himself. I actually found the entire concept and story quite enthralling.Russell Crowe plays Robin Longstride, the man who returns from the crusades and ends up a legendary outlaw. His taking of the 'Robin Hood' persona is mysterious and he does a good job despite probably being a little old for the part. Crowe has had a lot of downs in his career as of late and I think he showed some of his original charm that made him such a big star in the early 2000's. He carries the lead well. Cate Blanchett who I am no fan of and think she is extremely over rated actually does well mostly because I think she tones down her usual over acting to play Marion Loxley. The romance between Robin and Marion is played down a lot which I thought was a welcome change. Max von Sydow gives a stellar performance as Walter Loxley. He doesn't get a huge part but he still is really great. Oscar Isaac gives a solid if not maybe slightly typical performance as the 'evil' Prince John. He doesn't add anything different to the character. The same could be said in some ways about Kevin Durand who plays Robin's right hand man John and yet Durand seems to give a better performance. He just has more on screen charisma. Other supporting cast members may be or are proved actors that get little to no screen time including William Hurt and Mark Addy both who are great in their roles but are given very little depth or time.Robin Hood is a well written, well produced and well made adventure film. Would I have enjoyed a little more action? Yes definitely but even still director Ridley Scott knows adventure, and he knows how to do the historic epic like few other directors. He's made science fiction into epics. Was Robin Hood perfect? No definitely not. As much as I thought Russell Crowe did a solid job, I'm not sure he was the ideal choice for the lead. I would have liked a younger, very talented actor to play Robin Hood (think Heath Ledger perhaps.) Regardless anyone who grew up adoring Robin Hood or anyone who has seen the countless films about him is sure to be impressed with the fact that despite knowing the characters you can't know what's coming next in this version because it is a whole new twist to the legend and as stated before that in itself makes it impressive. I'm glad the film is doing well overseas because it deserves to be appreciated. 8/10",Robin Hood
34,wellthatswhatithinkanyway,"More historically accurate, but dull latest adaptation of folk legend",4,29 June 2010,"STAR RATING: ***** Saturday Night **** Friday Night *** Friday Morning ** Sunday Night * Monday Morning With well known franchises being the in thing in recessionary Hollywood, there couldn't have been a better time for the release of Ridley Scott's latest, his take on the Nottingham legend that has inspired tales for centuries. With a lavish budget and epic scale behind it, it's the type of thing with clout that ensures a more than modest take at the box office and, since he's a director they warm to, maybe a chance at the Oscars. Reuniting with frequent collaborator Russell Crowe in the title role, Scott's version delves deeper into the world surrounding the legendary hero, with a mounting tension and threat of invasion with France, a treacherous servant of the crown (Mark Addy) and a philandering, arrogant upstart Sheriff of Nottingham (Matthew McFadyen.) Actually, the story's too complicated, with too much going on and too much information trying to be processed, so it's never that easy to follow and at well over two hours a bit of a chore to sit through once the gist of things has lost you.On the plus side, it all feels like it bears more reality to the time and place it's set in, everything feeling more authentic and real compared to the most recent depiction in the shape of Kevin Reynolds's corny 1991 offering, with Kevin Costner keeping his American accent (?!?) and Brian Adams's laugh worthy Everything I Do (I Do It For You) hitting the top of the charts. By contrast, lead star Crowe is among many in the cast to display a fine linguistic grasp of the northern/midlands dialect of Nottingham. Those looking for fine period setting and historically accurate description won't be disappointed. The trouble is, none of it is any fun, and it all feels too dull and heavy to entertain. Once again, Scott hasn't done things by halves and his typical grey, humourless style is in evidence, making it all even more boring. It's like Gladiator on tamazepam, the same team but a duller, flatter result, for all it's battle scenes and jostling, mostly just of interest to history buffs with an affinity for an old style of cinema. **",Robin Hood

The father asks him to hang around and pretend to be his son and the husband to Lady Marion.During this time, France attacks England. Robin is a hero in battle, and England wins.

They have been crusaders with King Richard the Lionhearted and are ransacking one last castle in France. Alas, the king dies in battle and another knight, with his last breath, asks Robin to return a valued sword to his father, the lord of Loxley. Robin agrees. But, after the younger Loxley passes, Longstride gets an idea. Why doesn't he and his pals, commoners, put on the armor and assume the identities of the fallen knights. Risking quite a bit, they do so, and once back in Britain, take the king's crown to his widow (Eileen Atkins). Immediately, she puts the crown on the head of her only remaining son, John, and a new king is on the throne. Unknown to the king, a close adviser, Godfrey (Mark Strong) is secretly aiding the French in a future planned invasion of Britain. Thus, when John dispatches another trusted lord (William Hurt) and puts Godfrey in charge, he is making a grave mistake. Especially so when the duo decide on heavy taxation to refill the king's coffers. In the meanwhile, Robin heads toward Nottingham. When he reaches the Loxley estate, he finds the old lord Walter (Max Von Sydow) blind and frail and the new widow, Marian (Cate Blanchett) feisty and beautiful. Grateful for the sword, Walter begs Robin to stay on at the Loxley estate and pretend to be the fallen lord, newly returned, for the future of the property is at stake with no other heir. He does so. This upsets the sheriff of Nottingham (Matthew Macfadyen), who had his eyes on Marian and the 5,000 acre land as well. With Godfrey's present plundering of the villages for spoil and his future invasion on the horizon, what will good Englishman like Robin do? And, does Marian and Robin have a budding inclination for one another? This is an excellent film, in many ways, but its violence is potent. It should have received an R rating and I would not let anyone under 17 see it. The many sword stabbings, arrow-run-throughs, and burnings will cause timid viewers to look away, myself included. However, the cast is superlative, with Crowe giving a great performance as Robin and Blanchett, Von Sydow, Strong, Atkins, Macfadyen, and all, all of the others doing fine work. Especially worthy is Hurt's turn, the best he has given in awhile. Then, too, the costumes, scenery, script, direction, and cinematography re-create the time period and situations with rousing success, resulting in a very commendable film.

40,Dr_Coulardeau,History seen in action,10,23 May 2010,"The film is not only dealing with Robin Hood, the famous and mysterious character of English history and the Forest of Sherwood. It is a lot more, a film on the tricky period when Richard Lionheart coming back from his crusade is killed in a battle in France. This time when John Lackland is taking over and has to face the attempt to invade England performed by the French king Philip II Augustus. The invasion was prepared by a treacherous friend of King John who tried to use his friendship to serve the interests of the French king. He submitted the northern part of the country to heavy taxes and a lot of violence that caused their rebellion against the king, which should have enabled the French fleet to disembark and conquer London. The film is essentially an adventure film but it is also based on history and it respects that history. The way the King manipulates the rebellious barons to get their help in time to defeat the French on his own beaches is the perfect case of a liar that uses the belief in divine kings of the time only to seize more power and deprive others from any small piece of it. We know it will take fifteen to sixteen years for an alliance to be built between the barons, the church and the merchants of the City of London to force that king John to come to Runnymede and accept to sign the Magna Carta that will change the world, that represents the first step of that vast historical change that we call democracy. Fifteen small years in the heart of feudalism to achieve that phenomenal transformation. And that Magna Carta is so small when measured with our own values that we are amazed by the infinitely small in history. Robin Hood, who is not yet Robin Hood, since the film ends when Robin Longstride is outlawed by John Lackland, is thus only one small man among these men, and women, who made history then, or started to make history, though it seems fairer to say that they were those who finally brought England in the wake of the slowly moving boat of history. This action film only becomes that historical film I am speaking of if you know all these details of English history. Otherwise it will remain an action film.

41,zkonedog,"The ""Dark Knight"" For The Robin Hood Character",9,11 March 2017,"Throughout the years (or in this case centuries), the story of ""Robin Hood"" has been told in many different variations. There's the swashbuckler (Errol Flynn), the comedian (""Men in Tights""), and the cartoonish (Disney), to name just a few. This Ridley Scott effort takes a sort of ""Dark Knight"" approach to the green-clad archer, perusing the roots of the character and explaining how the legend began.For a basic plot summary, this film centers on Robin Longstride (Russell Crowe), who struggles to exist in King John's rule of England after returning from the Crusades. After completing one final mission after the wars to the Loxley house, Robin meets Marion Loxley (Cate Blanchett), a sort of kindred spirit in the fight against the oppressive government.This film works on a number of different levels...-It is great action/adventure. The war scenes are reminiscent of ""Lord of The Rings"", and just as thrilling (not overdone or cheesy).-The grittiness. This isn't a swashbuckling Robin, but rather a good-hearted man just trying to do what is right. Also, this is a great imagining of 13th century England, making you feel as if what you are seeing could have actually transpired.-The birth of the legend. The ""cannon"" points (Marion, Band of Merry Men, archery, etc.) are subtle and serve to enhance the overall plot, not beat you over the head like ""look what we did!"".Overall, then, this is a very underrated film, especially if you are at all a fan of the Robin Hood character.

42,johnnyboyz,"Scattered and seldomly consistent in overall manner, this 21st Century embodiment of a famous fable is scrambled but curiously engrossing in the long run.",6,1 February 2011,"I'd be lying if I said I didn't especially take to Ridley Scott's 2010 released take on the Robin Hood legend; a wavering and sporadic, but mostly interesting and a fairly involving account of a man whose name has passed down unto generations and whose incarnation into moving image over the years has brought about both wildly differing approaches and critical reception. I liked it about enough to have a wave of curiosity wash over me once all had been said and done, it had ended and the new order upon which particular characters we have come to either admire or despise had made it known precisely where they stood. If the material is ever revisited by those involved in the making of this, I'd find it harder to casually dismiss any announcement of said project than I would to actually look forward to the film.Australian actor Russell Crowe plays the titular lead of Robin Hood; the film bringing its audience into his world for the first time we see him as he fights in a battle many miles from his English homeland with hundreds of other troops during one of King Richard's crusades. The film wastes little time in introducing its lead as somewhat of an action man, the partaking in a battle within a battle involving the storming of a castle gate; the relaying of cover fire by way of his bow and arrow as well as the bravery of heading on out into the deadly mire so as to rescue a comrade, the key characteristics of bravery and ability which will go on to formulate this character throughout. Away from the battlefield, an exchange with the king Himself has Robin stand up to an authoritarian figure; sees him speak his mind honestly and bravely about an issue of great importance to him and thus goes to further establish traits of a positive nature with the fact he isn't afraid of taking a stance on an issue of a somewhat political nature. This, following a fight incurred because of another individual and their own challenging of Robin's authenticity as an honest man; an accusation later to be revealed as false and fruitless.The supporting acts arrive by way of a brave and rather feisty Marion (Blanchett), a poor farmer living with her father Sir Walter (von Sydow) and having issues of her own with unruly kids whom sabotage her crops, although remains herself a dab hand at archery. Nearer the throne, Prince John (Isaac) is established as being a bit of an idiot more often than not; a disrespectful and somewhat foul little man whom is the last of his brothers and sisters in line for the throne. He has seemingly little interest for anyone beside himself and enjoys sleeping around out of wedlock with a French woman named Isabella, a role that Léa Seydoux plays but Ludivine Sagnier would've sunk her teeth into, much to his superior's displeasure whilst his father's away fighting. On another strand, English knight Sir Godfrey (Strong) mislays information both to and from various parties therein as he conspires with the French king to bring about ruin of the English within, so that an invasion can be successfully carried out amidst interior fighting. In the middle of all this is Crowe's Hood, a man looking for a free pass back to England after deserting the Crusades.Renowned for his usually cut-and-thrust screenplays which are commonly blended in with material of a pulpy nature, screenwriter Brian Helgeland (working here with Ridley after a couple of projects with brother Tony) keeps everything darting along at a brisk old pace; his work adapted by a man whom you feel is in total control of what it is he wants up there on screen. But I wanted to like a lot of it a whole lot more, the film maintaining a frustratingly reigned in sensibility about it; the film coming to flit wildly between tones and content, the genres of war; romance; comedy of a relatively goofy nature as well as content of a politically infused ilk coming to fuse uneasily as bloody battle violence comes to uncomfortably merge with screwball romance. Take, for instance, and much later on in the film, a stretch of about two minutes of film which encompasses both an individual leaping from one burning thatched roof to another in slow motion as the fires around him rage, which occurs right after a sequence in which a town is effectively liquidated. One scene looks as it was lifted straight out of Elem Klimov's 1985 Soviet film Come and See, the other is just Assassin's Creed II goes to Sherwood Forest.I enjoyed the film's better parts, during which it draws on inspiration from the western and runs on a premise of this notion of having to get from 'A' to 'B' with an item, or a MacGuffin, as those whom will kill you if they catch up with you looms ominously overhead. Crowe's large build and grizzled tone, regardless of sporadic accent, as he rides his horse from point to point, often as a lone warrior immensely skilled in the art of specific weaponry, across barren looking 13th century England locales is good fun; his eventual coming up against a somewhat tyrannical rule and the using of the skills he has garnered from war against that rule more interesting than it deserves to be: where The American Civil War has been replaced by The Crusades; six-shooters with swords; the 19th Century with the Middle-Ages and Texas with Nottinghamshire. Ridley Scott's Robin Hood is a slick and alluring enough little piece, a tad stretched for the self-discovery material Robin must progress through and we must endure, but competent and engaging enough to recommend.",Robin Hood
43,filipemanuelneto,"Reasonable, warms the audience without boiling",5,16 December 2016,"This movie is very reasonable, worth seeing in family or with a small group of friends, just for fun. Its not remarkable or extraordinary but neither a shame. It seeks to reconstruct the story of Robin Hood, framing it in the real historical context. So much of the tale to which we are accustomed changes radically, which can be considered positive (a new point of view, a new perspective) or negative (construct a new story keeping almost the same characters). Both opinions are well founded. I liked the idea of ​​rethinking the tale. Cinema cannot be based on eternal remakes. Despite that, some of the script's options were extraordinarily risky, not to say unrealistic. The idea of ​​a footman pretending to be a knight, though for good reason, is totally unrealistic, and I'm just setting an example. In the medieval mentality, it would be considered insulting and Robin would be quickly punished. Robin's association with the creation of the Magna Carta also seems to be forced. So, while I recognize that the film is interesting, I must admit that the writer risked too much and the film lost with that.Russell Crowe did a decent job in the role of Robin but he never really seemed at ease with his character. The actor lacked the ability to truly look like a leader, something Robin proved to be. It's hard not to compare this work with the resounding success he has achieved in ""Gladiator"", as they feature the same lead actor and director, Ridley Scott. But perhaps the way Scott thought Robin should be was not, in fact, the most appropriate. This resulted in a Robin who seems too calm and uncharacteristic. We do not see him as a real man, much less a warrior, a leader. This Robin had to be all this because the film required it, but I can more easily imagine Marion (Cate Blanchett) leading men into battle. The charismatic British actress has a huge presence and gives the character a strength of her own. The only bad note of her participation is the absolute absence of intercourse with Crowe, which she should do romantic pair.The technical requirements of the film are very well. The photograph is well enough, resembling something between a ""Gladiator"" and a ""King Arthur"". The soundtrack does not bring anything new, plays the part of it without a note of merit or private depreciation, which is sad for a movie that tries to be epic, try to follow in the footsteps of Gladiator (its necessary to remember the extraordinary original soundtrack of this movie?). The costumes and scenarios follow the same path.",Robin Hood
44,leplatypus,Robin not good (tv),4,5 February 2017,"As the recent King Arthur, Hollywood destroys a British myth by making the hero a war leader! You can argue what you want: Robin Hood is the good figure who steals the rich to give the poor! Here it's not at all about that as Robin becomes (in a ridiculous story) the defender of human rights or more accurately those of the barons! So it's particularly stupid and things gets aggravated with his poor romance (he takes the identity of a dead husband to get the wife!)... Sure with Scott directing, the movie is beautifully shot but he confirms his senility with another shameful choice of script! This war leader orientation was so dull that i left before the end while his armies arrives on the hills!",Robin Hood
45,pmtelefon,Another Ridley Scott dud.,3,3 November 2019,"I know director Ridley Scott has made a bunch of movies but why is he considered a good director? With the exception of ""Alien"", are any of his movies really worth the trouble? Are any of them worth a second viewing? ""Robin Hood"" isn't even worth the first viewing. This is a long, noisy, boring epic. There's a ton of arrows flying back and forth but who cares? This movie has a bunch of characters running around but who cares about them? Not me. What about the ""wild and crazy"" merry men? They're annoying. I've never been a fan of Russell Crowe. I'm still not. I haven't seen all the Robin Hood movies out there but I can't imagine any of them being worse than this one.",Robin Hood
46,Turfseer,Crowe musters no charm in history tinged prequel,5,6 November 2010,"The new Russell Crowe 'Robin Hood' is actually a prequel. It tells the story of how the mythical outlaw became the great 'man of the people' BEFORE roaming around Sherwood Forest with his 'merry men'. Instead of being pitted against the Sheriff of Nottingham (who has a minor part here), Robin takes on Godfrey, a bald-headed bad guy and enforcer for King John who later betrays the homeland by allying himself with the French.'Robin Hood' begins nicely with a finely costumed and gritty battle scene in France. Crowe plays Robin Longstride, an expert archer in King Richard the Lionheart's army. The King has just returned from the Third Crusade in the Holy Land when he is felled by an arrow during battle. It would have been nice if the film's scenarists had King Richard only speaking French since he never spoke English and spent most of his adult life in Europe, far from his native England. Longstride decides to return to England after he assumes the identity of a dying Knight, Robin Loxley, who has just been ambushed by Godfrey and his men. Longtsride promises Loxley that he'll return the family sword to his father back in Nottingham.Longstride returns Richard's crown to John and informs him of his death. John is promptly crowned the new King and is determined to tax the hell out of the Kingdom. In his view, Richard squandered the treasury by paying for all of intrigues on the Continent and his ill-considered campaign in the Holy Land. He reminds his mother during a bitter argument that at one point, England had to pay a ransom to save Richard after he had been kidnapped by the Duke of Austria in 1192.With Longstride's appearance at the Court, I found it perplexing that none of the noblemen recognized that he was an imposter. After Longstride returns to Nottingham and accepts Sir Walter Loxley's proposal to impersonate his now deceased son, even more improbable is that no one in the town seems to be able to connect the dots and figure out that Longstride is not who he says he is.The main problem with 'Robin Hood' is that Russell Crowe exudes little charm, playing the mischievous outlaw as a grim-faced action hero. As for his cohorts, Little John and Will Scarlett, they have little to do except get drunk and assist Robin and Friar Tuck as they steal grain, confiscated from the local population by Church authorities. This act wins Marion Loxley over to Robin after she initially is stunned when her father-in-law asks her to pretend that she's married to Longstride. Most of the forest scenes can be found in the Director's Cut which were wisely trimmed for the theatrical release. For those insist on watching the Director's Cut, you'll be treated to 1) Marion and a goat stuck in quicksand and both subsequently saved by Robin and 2) Marion saving Robin after he's kidnapped by local orphans dressed as forest-dwelling savages.'Robin Hood' fares no better with its antagonists. The screenwriters come up with nothing to distinguish Godfrey from any of the typical bad guys found in any of today's films, whether they're based on real or fictional characters. And The Sheriff of Nottingham is even less likable than Godfrey with his constant lecherous advances towards the widow Marion. Only John is a little more nuanced as he vacillates in trying to appease the rebellious Northern Barons.Finally, history takes a back seat to any kind of verisimilitude when the French invade England shortly after John's ascension to the throne. In reality, King Philip of France recaptured English-held territory in France and John promptly invaded that country. It was actually eighteen years later that France finally waged war in English territory. In addition, the signing of the Magna Carta and its disavowal by King John, also came years after as depicted here in this film.Despite the convoluted chronologies, there is nothing wrong in attempting to depict Robin Hood in the context of his times. Except for blatantly anachronistic scenes such as when the French disembark from their warships in the style of a D-day invasion, I found the attention to period detail to be impressive. Nonetheless, without any charm emanating from the principal character, a lack of chemistry between the romantic leads, antagonists who show little complexity and glacial pacing in spots, the new 'Robin Hood' is at best, a lackluster affair.",Robin Hood
47,Chris Knipp,Robin Hood the prequel,7,17 May 2010,"I take it that the humorlessness of the new Ridley Scott Robin Hood film is just the way things came out rather than by any firm design to drain all merriment out of the merry men, Friar Tuck, Little John, et al. The cinematic panache of this popular English legend of the 1200's has dropped ever since Eroll Flynn. Kevin Costner (1991) was never noted for that quality. And a more dour and gloomy Robin Hood than Russell Crowe would be hard to find. Jake Gyllenhaal was doubtless busy camping it up as a Persian prince for Disney. Now, Scott's folks in this movie, the yeomen and the wenches, do try to be jolly. There's a lot of dancing of the earnestly medieval drum-beating, foot-stomping kind. The trouble is it's' much outweighed by those other medieval activities, boiling-oil casting, arrow-shooting, sword-fighting, and dying of wounds. You may really miss that dashing fellow in the green cap. Mr. Crowe is dressed in sweaty grays.In narrative terms this version of the popular hero represents a series of choices among varying historical (or unhistorical) legends with some new flourishes added, notably one about the Magna Carta. Early ballads apparently do not explain why Robin became an outlaw. The stories differ on whether he's a nobleman or a yeoman of noble character, though his rank has gone up over time. King John, the younger brother who succeeded Richard the Lionhearted, has not fared well in history, and here he's a selfish upstart who allies with an impostor, Godfrey, who's English when he wants to be but works for the King of France, a slovenly wretch who slurps raw oysters and hides from the battles. The writers give Crowe's Robin a new gambit. He is returning, wearily, from the Crusades. He is present when a nobleman, Robert of Loxley, is killed in a skirmish with the French, and King Richard has just died too, so Robin becomes Robert, urges his best mates to pretend to be knights, and brings news of the king's death back to the English court. It's a tricky maneuver, and the wily Godfrey doesn't buy it.When he's in danger of getting wiped out by the French and needs all the help he can get, this new King John agrees to Crowe's Robin to sign a pact to grant rights to the people. But later he reneges on the promise and declares Robin an outlaw to avoid being bothered by him further. This leaves unexplained King John's actual association with signing the Magna Carta.What struck me as most strange and most interesting was having the venerable (and still wonderful) Max von Sydow -- famous from Ingmar Bergman's The Seventh Seal, where he played a returning noble crusader, this time cast as a stay-at-home, too old for a Crusade, the father of Robert of Loxley. Robin comes to find Loxley's house and father and, thereby, ""Maid"" Marion, who in this version is the Crusader-widow wife of Robin of Loxley. He married her years earlier and then went off at once to the Holy Land. Max, that is, Loxley senior, who is blind (a nice touch, especially since he dies in a sword fight), forces Robin to take on the identity of his son so the greedy new King John, or whoever else is robbing unfortunate nobles in the name of the Crown, won't seize his considerable land holdings -- 5,000 acres, Marion says -- when he's gone.Marion is a yeomanly role for Cate Blanchett, who's seen doing some medieval plowing of those acres at first. They've fallen on hard times, been wiped out by tax collectors. Ah ha, yes! Tax collectors. Call for Robin Hood! Ridley Scott's movie does emphasize the need to protect the English from the English Crown's rapacious desire to grab land, crops, and valuables, as well as the French King's desire to grab England. But this isn't a rob-the-rich-give-to-the-poor Robin Hood -- which in fact is a later permutation of the character. Here he's just more a kind of legal advocate, a civil rights activist.Loxley's mansion has huge rooms, but the floor is strewn with straw and the bedroom is full of dogs. Cate Blanchett does a good job considering that she's given nothing logical to do. She must alternately be down to earth, working a plow when needed; regal on horseback; so pure she threatens to neuter Robin if he touches her; then warm and womanly when things get friendly between them by and by. Good role for Cate perhaps, bad one for us to relate to in any coherent way.Ridley Scott's Robin Hood is conceived by the writers (Brian Helgeland and staff) as a prequel, with old-fashioned movie scroll captions at the outset that look like a Classics Illustrated Comic Book. A similar scroll comes in at the end to announce ""The Legend Begins."" Begins what, though, exactly? Russell Crowe looked pretty tired when the movie began. We're pretty tired when it ends two hours and twenty minutes later (slightly sooner at Cannes, where this was the opener). Unfortunately many of Robin Hood's pals (except Friar Tuck, who turns up later) were along from the Crusades, so they don't get the usual colorful introductions. And despite some stomping and drinking and wenching, there's not a lot of camaraderie. When you take away that and then eliminate the robbing of the rich, you take away most of the fun of the Robin Hood legend. (Except it's just about to begin.) True, there are some energetic bad guys, chief among them young King John (Oscar Isaac) and the spy, Godfrey (Mark Strong, Lord Blackwood in Sherlock Holmes). But the lasses get short shrift, and so do the buddies. Yes, this is a grim and violent take on a once inspiring (if hokey) legend, and no amount of lovely Welsh woodland landscapes can change that. Not one of the films Sir Ridley will be most fondly remembered for.",Robin Hood
48,elshikh4,Deadly Ordinary !,5,19 July 2010,"This is so old old old old old-fashioned movie!Sometimes (Ridley Scott) makes a movie for his own spirit. Sometimes he makes one for the studio. This is definitely one for the studio, yet without his spirit, or any spirit!What could be new in this movie about Robin Hood? I must say the storyline of his relationship with Marion, the talk about his father, and that's about it!So what was distinct? Frankly nothing! (Scott) collected some talents around him to do a movie. And they did. As blandly as they could!Aside from looking a bit old, (Russell Crowe) was not special. The role was awfully lesser than him, with no details of any kind. He seemed like a robot that repeats occasionally: ""Ask Me Nicely""! (Cate Blanchett) looked unsightly mannish, and also the role gave her no deep or discrete thing to do. Forget any relief, the side characters had been treated horribly. King Richard's brother was written in unbelievably bad way; he's not a joke of a person the way he was in (Prince of Thieves - 1991), and he's not a strong unfair tyrannical either; remember that the power of the hero comes from the power of his enemy. A plot hole annoyed me very; how all the workers at the farm of (Blanchett)'s husband didn't know the face of their master who went to war just 10 years ago, while they were all more than 10-year-old to me!I didn't watch any real good action sequences. The last battle was news brief. You know, the poster showed (Crowe) brandishing his sword, screaming in great anger. Well, I didn't see any brandishing, sword, screaming, or anger! The cinematography is mostly gray; I didn't figure it out, is it the dark ages?, is it a way to reach a case of black and white movie?, or is it the sensation of (Scott) while doing this? I'll go for the last prospect!Although there is tight pace but no inner liveliness, since everything I saw was made before, yet with feeling. I was bored to death at the second half, for instance during the last battle I wanted to leave anyhow, or sleep in my seat. I refused to do both, but I couldn't deter myself from yawing non-stop; this movie causes that perfectly!Save 2 or 3 lines of dialogue, a scene about the crusades' shameful crimes, another about the socialism that didn't find a way during the age of feudalism and monopolization, added to some sound effects, I found nothing interesting. There is no fun, action, or emotionally moving moment. Entertaining is an irrelevant word to this movie. There was a thick sheet of glass between us and the screen, or rather between the movie makers and the movie itself!After The Postman (1997), Blood Work (2002), The Sin Eater (2003), and now Robin Hood (2010), I must be cautious towards anything (Brian Helgeland) may write again. Though I believe I was late to understand the wink (Scott) gave at the start. With ancient boards that told the whole story of the movie, which we were about to see. It was an enough confession that there would be nothing to watch later. And there isn't indeed.This is a deadly ordinary B movie. I would admire it if it was made in the 1950s, however it wasn't, and it sure lacked that time's wit as well. (Scott) did it against his will. It shows. Otherwise, he aimed at making his most tasteless work ever. So, I'll wait for his next movie, or, in all probability, the one he gave (Robin Hood) for the studio to be capable of doing it afterwards!In general, any known (Robin Hood) movie is better than it. The most movie I hated for (Scott), (Legend - 1985), is better than it, since it had a true desire to look and feel different. Even a recent one, (Knight and Day - 2010), while being a faulty idiot is better than it; at least it has dancing music during the action sequences, that's a kind of modernism for God's sake!P.S: A couple was setting in front of me at the theater. Right after the end, she asked him unimpressed: ""What do you think?"", and he answered her seriously: ""Usual, but the music is great"". Well, I do agree with him, except that I don't see that the music is great!",Robin Hood
49,DarkVulcan29,It's no Prince of Thieves,8,31 May 2010,"Unlike some other Robin Hoods, Russell Crow can speak with a British accent, a very rough British accent.I like this Robin Hood, because it's very different, it has some humor moments but other than it takes itself very seriously, like an awesome epic like Kingdom of Heaven. It does have some battle scenes. Russell Crow is awesome as the main character, so are Scott Grimes(ER), Kevin Durand(Wolverine Origins), and Mark Abby(Still Standing) are memorable has the merry men, and Cate Blanchard is quite good as Maid Marion. But it's Mark Strong that is quite memorable as the villainous Godfrey, he is good with his cold eye stare.Although this movie does slow at times, but it was still entertaining.",Robin Hood
50,generationofswine,An Honest Review,3,1 July 2017,"What we have here is an Ego problem...and that makes Prince of Thieves look great in comparison.But I'll be honest, I can watch Prince of Thieves over and over again. It's a fun movie, so long as you only watch the Alan Rickman parts.But Rickman was kind of out there on his own for most of the film and able to do his own thing and cut loose...while poor Freeman was stuck opposite Costner in every scene and, being a generous man he stepped back and gave Kevin the opportunity to not even attempt to act.Here wen have, again, some pretty good actors and some pretty clever character actors...and Russel Crowe.My issue with a LOT of Crowe movies is that he's not generous like Freeman. He doesn't step back and let others do their thing so the movie will succeed.Crowe hogs as much of every scene as he can and, when he's not directly talking, moves, does things to draw your attention to him and not the other actors.Master and Commander suffered for it. He was probably too afraid to do it opposite Pacino in The Insider, I can see Bale being just as aggressive in 3:10 to Yuma...but in Robin Hood, Crowe is up to his old tricks again.So you have the Russel Crowe show once more and that gets tiresome. It gets tiresome fast.The rule, at least my rule for Crowe movies is simple, if it looks like he's going to be forced to share it will be a great film...if it looks like he can hog it, the movie is going to stink.Robin Hood Stinks",Robin Hood
51,freemantle_uk,The re-invention of a legend,8,12 May 2010,"Robin Hood, Robin Hood riding through the glen, Robin Hood with his band of Merry Men: you will get none of that in this new verison of the legend. With Ridley Scott Russell Crowe have created new type of Robin Hood for these an audience who want to gritty verison the legend who has been constantly re-invented.1199, England has been suffering from the heavy burden of taxation to fund Richard I's (Danny Huston) wars and the countryside was suffering from social problems with war orphans running wild. Richard I's army was marching through France to get back to England after the Crusades and looting and the raiding the French as much as possible whilst on the way. Robin Longstride (Russell Crowe) and his friends are archers within the army. When Richard I died in battle they fled and Robin assumes the identity of a English lord who has been murdered in an ambush. Godfrey (Mark Strong), an English knight and an adviser to King John (Oscar Issac) secretly meets with the French with a plot to make the new king unpopular and force the nation into civil war, thereby weakening England and making the kingdom easy to invade. Robin goes to Nottingham and gives the news to Sir Walter Loxley (Max von Sydow) and Lady Maiden (Cate Blanchett) that their son and husband has died. They suggest that Robin continues to pretend that he was really Sir Robert Loxley and as the man Robin becomes a leading figure to unite the kingdom to stop the impending invasion.Scott is one of the best directors around for historical film: he has shown a great skill for taking people back to another time and show what the period would have been like (even if he has to take a few liberties to the historical facts). With Robin Hood he shows that the Medieval period was dark and dirty, even for members of the gentry. Battles are hard and brutal, though they is a lot less blood then there was in Gladiator, which is a shame. Scott, with his screenwriter Brain Helgeland, set out a more complex, balance picture. Richard I was not made out to be the great king people think he is because of his heavy taxation and ruthless nature. John was made out to be someone who was dogmatic and naïve, but not someone wanting to be a tyrant just for the fun of it. He was portrayed in a more sympathetic light to what has been shown in the past. It was Godfrey who was the main villain and in the Medieval period national loyalty was not such a big issue as it is today. This is all refreshing to see when most films just show a black and white world.Scott delivers some excellent battle scenes in this film during. But he slows the film down long enough to allow the plot to develop and adds a little bit of humour. This is however a less bloody epic to allow a slightly younger audience to see it. There is the theme of the idea of a king's right to govern, but this is mostly an action, not a historical film about Medieval government.Crowe and Scott reunite again and Crowe gives a solid performance as a rougher and tougher Robin. Blanchett too is solid as an older Maiden, showing she is a tough woman who also willing to fight: a woman that properly would not have existed in this period. Strong shows once again that he is a excellent villain, having stared in Sherlock Holmes and Kick-Ass, a man who thinks about his own self interest. Strong has been making a good career as villain for hire and he was the strongest actor in the film. The American in this English set film did well, William Hurt was very strong as the wronged advice in the King's court, whilst Huston seemed to be having a blast as Richard I and obviously shows he is not as noble he seems.Helgeland wrote a clever script, showing Medieval ideology and a complex political situation. His previous Medieval film was A Knight's Tale, which he wrote and directed. But with Robin Hood he seems to have grown up as a writer and gives this film a little more of a complex plot and shows a bigger picture. He also cleverly mixes different aspects about how the legend has changed, like how Robin starting as a commoner and pretends to be a higher ranked man. The film also covers its bases by showing the two sites places that claim to be Robin's home, Nottingham and Barnsdale. However this film felt like an origins story, a start to a new film series. This is Robin Hood that has not been seen on screen like this before. Hopefully if there is a sequel then Matthew MacFadyen as the Sheriff of Nottingham would get a bigger role. Robin Hood is also historically suspect, with events and dates being changed and made up, some ideas and culture also seems to be the victim of artistic license. But Scott knows that storytelling requires character development and show a more balanced picture, particularly with historically set films. At least this film does accept that it is a piece of historical fiction.An enjoyable summer flick.",Robin Hood
52,dfranzen70,I don't think the Disney version was as bloody...,6,13 August 2011,"If I had to use just one word to describe the new Robin Hood film, I wouldn't be able to do it. There is plenty to like about the movie, but if you are looking for much resembling the legend as we all know it, you might be disappointed. The Disney version had more in common with the tale of Robin Hood than this Ridley Scott version.Russell Crowe is Robin Hood, although I don't think he's ever referred to as such. Cate Blanchett is Lady Marion - no, not Maid, Lady. Right. And the Sheriff of Nottingham, although not a good guy, is barely in the movie. And much of the movie has more to do with the invading French army than Robin Hood robbing the rich to feed the poor, so it's essentially a war movie, not a swashbuckling romance. Errol Flynn might wonder why there's less derring-do and more gritty realism.Crowe is Robin Longstride, a soldier in King Richard's Crusades. As the army is returning from its latest Crusade, Richard is killed, thus making his younger brother John, played with efficient malevolence by Oscar Isaac, the new king of England. Robin heads back to England separately with some of his not-yet-merry men and stumbles across a group of knights carrying Richard's crown and stallion, heading to a boat to take them to England. All the knights are slain in an ambush, but with a dying breath one hands Robin his sword and begs him to return it to his home in England and give it to his estranged father.The man was named Loxley - sound familiar? - and his father is now an old blind man (Crusades took a long time back then). Robin returns the sword to the man and meets Loxley's widow, Lady Marion Loxley. But the elder Loxley (Max von Sydow) has a plan - he wants Robin to pretend to be his prodigal son, thus giving hope to the impoverished village. And then it gets complicated.A lot of exposition, and we're not even at the battle scenes! Let's just say that John and his henchman Godfrey (Mark Strong) want Robin out of the way, as he ""knows too much."" Meanwhile, the French are plotting to invade and are under the impression that England's on the verge of civil war, what with various barons trying to get the king to sign the Magna Carta and all. It should be noted that there are numerous anachronisms in the movie, so it really shouldn't be viewed as a history lesson.Both Crowe and Blanchett are terrific, as always. Their performances help one forget Kevin Costner and Mary Elizabeth Mastrontonio, thank goodness. Each brings a lot of passion to their roles. Blanchett can pull off the difficult feat of looking good - not gorgeous, not sexy - and tough at the same time. Her Marion is ballsy, almost Irish in disposition.Scott's direction helps a bit as well, particularly in the climactic battle scene (which looks too much like the Normandy invasion in WW II, really). Unlike some action movies, where the movements are so quick you cannot tell who is decapitating whom, everything feels clear, focused, and logical.The only problem I have with this movie is that it seems to be trying to cram too much plot into itself. Although one can tell the combatants apart in a fight scene, it's often tough to know who is on which side. Who is traitorous to whom, anyway? There seem to be too many plot threads; I would have liked to known more about von Sydow's Walter Loxley and less about, well, the lesser battles that are fought. Scott is an excellent director, but he throws too much action without balancing it with some more honest-to-goodness exposition and motivation. He needn't spend a lot of time on the Marion-Robin romance, either; as it was, it seemed to evolve organically anyway.Even so, the movie feels like it's lacking something, perhaps a real heart, despite the stars' efforts. Crowe is the oldest Robin Hood ever, but you wouldn't know it from his performance here, and Blanchett is definitely no pushover as Marion. But it felt as if I should have been more drawn into their relationship; the lack of emotional investment is the only thing that really hurts this film.",Robin Hood
53,PWNYCNY,"It's a movie, not a documentary",8,18 May 2010,"Okay, the story has some holes in it. Okay, the French never invaded England. Okay, Russell Crowe's performance is rather flat and Lady Marion is about as sexy as a sack of flour. Okay, the story isn't really about Robin Hood and that the title was used to hook an audience. Okay, the two kings are depicted as being stupid oafs. Okay, the movie takes huge liberties with the actual history of the period. Okay, the movie meanders at time and contains numerous subplots. Okay, Robin's merry men seem to be a reincarnation of the The Three Stooges. Okay, the idea of Robin's identity theft actually fooling the entire English nobility is almost laughable. Okay, the idea that a woman in 13th century England could be a large landowner in a heavily patriarchal society is taking literary license to the limit. Okay, the idea that Robin Hood had something to do with the Magna Carta is ludicrous. Okay, the French invasion is so poorly planned that it is obviously doomed to failure. Okay, the English nobles are simplistically depicted as a bunch of whining tax evaders. Okay, King John's mother has to be one of the most abrasive characters in the history of Hollywood epics. Okay, the movie's plot seems more like a western set in medieval England. Okay, in this movie Robin is grumpy man, never smiling, weighed down with problems and concerns. Nevertheless, I LIKED THIS MOVIE! Why, you ask? Because IT'S A MOVIE. It's not a documentary; it's not a docudrama. It is a movie and should be judged as such. Those critics who take this movie apart are ragging on a work of fiction. On that basis, any movie can be trashed. Hollywood takes liberties for dramatic purposes and in this movie, the relationship of Robin and Marian is subordinate to the larger story about the struggle for power. True, the title of the movie belies the actual story but then again, Robin Hood does figure in the story and perhaps will figure even more in the sequel if one is made.This is a great movie. Lots of action, good story, and invites a sequel. Despite the movie's title, the story goes beyond the Robin Hood legend and depicts the English political landscape of the early thirteenth century. This movie was driven not so much by the leading actors but by the supporting players, especially William Hurt and Mark Strong. Indeed, in a way they are the stars of the movie with Robin and Marian almost reduced to that of supporting roles. The reason for this is because the story is set within a political context and is not a love story. It's more about betrayal and the struggle for power, which is what drives the story. Robin is just one part of a larger picture that is the England of that time. Also impressive was the invasion scene which seemed to rely more on actual actors than on cgi. All in all, this is another Ridly Scott masterpiece, maybe not as flashy as Gladiator but still a strong story, well acted and a movie worth watching.",Robin Hood
54,meeza,Robin Hooood!!! Is no gooood!!!!!,6,23 May 2010,"Director Ridley Scott's cinematic version of ""Robin Hood"" does not focus on the legendary tale's primary premise of Mr. Hood stealing from the rich to give to the poor. Instead the film's narrative focuses on how the tyranny abuse of England's governmental reign led Robin Hood to that ""heroic outlaw"" crusade. Because Ridley decided to go this narrative route, his ""Robin Hood"" gets too muddled with medieval times debauchery within its monarchy bodies and not enough inner characterization is embodied in our hero Robin Hood, his hottie the Lady Marion, and the Merry Men which also reside in that geographic Robin Hood. I would have loved to see more of their mutual commonality and goodwill quest to salvage the underprivileged of England. Now I must commend the great Scott for orchestrating some marvelous battle sequences featuring the flawless armed craft of Hoodie with his Bowfist. Robin's ""bow and arrow"" bulls-eye skill was exhilarating to watch; too bad Scott did not showcase it as often as it should have during the movie. Moreover, the film's climatic beach- shore battle sequence between the Brits and the French seemed if I was watching ""Saving Private Robin""; even so, it was quite thrilling. The real outlaw of this film adaptation of ""Robin Hood"" was Screenwriter Brian Helgeland for developing a hellish monotonous scribe; it was the movie's ultimate ""die Robin die"" ticking bomb. I will not condemn star Russell Crowe's performance as Robin Hood with negative commentary because Crowe's thespian mastery could conquer all dull scripts handed to him. But then again, he was not the savior of ""Robin Hood""; no one was. Cate Blanchett's performance as Lady Marion was maid for mediocrity. And the same could be said for the rest of the supporting cast. John Mathieson's cinematography was a medieval visionary spectacle, but the landscape visual ""eye candy"" can just do so much in the cohesive success of a film. In the end, Director Ridley Scott's ""Robin Hood"" was just a ""bore and narrow"" adaptation of the classic tale. So there is no need to travel to your movie theatre hoods for a ""Robin Hood"" visit. ** Needs Improvement",Robin Hood
55,XweAponX,In My 2010 top films list as well as Tarantino's,10,14 June 2011,"As with all Ridley Scott films, this film is a quality piece of work. Like Gladiator, Scott takes an existing story and turns it on it's ear to give us a message that can be easily transferred to today's current events.If the story of Robin Hood is in itself a mish-mash of little pieces of mythology (Mostly French), then why should not Scott rip it apart from the roots and retell it? Unlike the 1938 Errol Flynn men-in-green-tights jumping around in a forest and stealing everything in sight version of Robin Hood (Which is mostly a humorous take on the legend), Russel Crow's Robin Longstride is a much more complex personality than his Swashbuckling Predecessor.This film begins as King Richard the Lionheart (Danny Houston) prepares to sack ""Just one more French Castle"" before heading home. Meanshile, his brother John (Oscar Issac) is having an affair with a relative of King Philip of France (Jonathan Zaccaï), Isabella of Angoulême played by Léa Seydoux. Robin Longstride, Will Scarlet (Scott Grimes), Little John (Kevin Durand), Allan A'Dayle (Alan Doyle) have been fighting for King Richard for many years.When King Richard is killed by an arrow from a French Cook, Robin and his men decide they might as well not stay around to see if they will be paid by a dead king... And they happen across the traitor Godfrey who has ambushed and killed Sir Robert Loxley who is taking the crown of Richard back to London, in his dying breath Loxley charges Longstride to bring the crown home and to take his sword back to his father in Nottingham.So sets the stage of this ""Prequel"" to the Robin Hood Legend, this could have been any other kind of story involving these characters, both historic and legendary. In a way, this is Ridley Scott's Alternate Timeline of British and French History, scooted around a bit to include the characters of Robin Hood and ""Maid Marion"" (Who is not a ""Maid"" in this treatment, but the wife of Sir Robert Loxley, played by the great Cate Blanchette).All of the film locations chosen convinced me that I was looking back at France and England of the 1200's - This is what Scott does best, in creating a window through time for us to look directly into this story as if it were an historical event. I must set aside certain complaints I have heard about this film, one of them being that King Philip's landing boats looked like WW-II ""Higgins Boats"" - And so what, Peter Jackson used the same design for the Orc landing boats in the invasion of Osgiliath in ""Return of the King"". It is probably stupid to think that a design used in the 20th Century was never thought of before that, because there really is nothing new under the sun, and if people made boats in the 11th Century, someone could have thought up something that looked like a Higgins Boat. The same complaint can be discarded in ""Gladiator"" where we see Handbills being passed out, although they had no block printing back then, they did have papyrus scrolls aka paper and inks, and artists who could have made such things up by hand.I have seen all kinds of negative reviews include these things, when it comes down to it, the use of such so called ""Anacronisms"" do not ruin the film for me, only the complaints of such.Of all of the Ridley Scott films of late, I am very surprised at the negative reaction to this one, and it is wholly unwarranted- This film has all the things a good film requires, and it is a fresh outlook on an old legend. Look for plenty of Scott Trademarks, like ""Arrow in Throat"" and ""Ship in Rough Seas"" and ""Knife in Neck"" which Scott likes to use. Oh Look! Two shills think I'm ""Not Helpful"" because I liked this film, as if I gave a ____. This is what I am talking about, too many negative reviews that are exact copies of each other.",Robin Hood
56,Fluke_Skywalker,"Not much robbin' by Robin, not much merry about the Merry Men",6,28 November 2013,"Act One: Standard stuff, but done fairly well. At this point I was involved and surprised by how much I was enjoying it.Act Two: Wait, when did this become 'Sommersby'? There's some good stuff in here, but it goes on waaay too long and the story loses its momentum. A momentum it never recovers in...Act Three: Seems to be building to something a bit more epic than what we ultimately get. And Marion showing up out of nowhere during the final battle not only undermines the emotion of her previous goodbye scene with Robin, it stretches credibility farther than the waistband on Crowe's trousers.Verdict: There are a number of really solid pieces here, but taken as a whole it just never comes together.",Robin Hood
57,juneebuggy,Enjoyed this Robin Hood prequel,8,1 October 2014,"When I first heard about this movie I thought really!? Do we need another Robin Hood movie? However in Ridley Scott's defence, I don't think this particular story has been told before.It's essentially a prequel and I liked this version, revealing how and why the ""Robin Hood"" of lore came to be. It's a solid movie; production value, attention to period detail, cinematography, the epic battle scenes -including hundreds of extras. It's all very good.Russell Crowe is believable enough even though he has very little dialogue and I think a bit too old. I liked Cate Blanchett as Marian and their romance held chemistry. Max Von Sydow was just awesome, stealing every scene he was in and I also liked all the sub-characters, his ""merry men"" as it were (the guy from Great Big Sea) Friar Tuck and some great baddies make it a stellar cast.There are also some really epic battle scenes, in particular the final one on the beach against the French. My only issue here was that it took on a very D-Day (Saving Private Ryan) feel, complete with the landing boats, and underwater shots of whizzing arrows and sinking bodies, the only difference being all the horses, swords and chainmail armour. 6/6/14",Robin Hood
58,Enchorde,"Entertaining, but where did Robin Hood go?",7,7 December 2010,"Recap: During Richard Lionhearts return to England after the crusades, Robin Longstride, an archer in Lionheart's army, is brave and naive enough to tell the king the truth. For that he is put in stocks, but when the king falls, Longstride and his friends make their escape during the chaotic aftermath. On their way to the coast they stumble upon an ambush on English knights carrying the crown back to England. The knights dies, but after fighting off the ambushers Longstride take the places of the knights, Longstride becomes Sir Robert of Loxley, to make their journey easier. But as they do so they stumble into big politics. The newly crowned King John raise taxes to the brink of civil war, and at the same time the king of France plans an invasion. Somebody must unite the Englishmen, and it is not the king Comments: Not the usual Robin Hood story (actually, that name is barely mentioned), but quite a different one. This story is not so romantic about it, Robin is not so noble, Marion not so sweet and ladylike, nothing so black and white as it usually is with Robin Hood. As such is has very little but a few names in common with how the legend is usually told. But I like it.It wasn't that hard to convince me though, I like medieval adventures almost anyhow they are made, but doesn't really take anything away from this Robin Hood. It is a real adventure, it got a lot of good action, a few sneaky missions and a portion of humor. A very good mix, actually. It is long, running at about two and a half hours, but it was never dull or felt long. Simply put, it was entertaining through every minute.I wonder though, I think I recall both Ridley Scott, the director, and Russell Crowe telling that this was more a serious approach to the tale. It is, in the way mentioned above, as nothing is as black and white as usual. It is a darker, more probable approach. I hope however, that they don't hope to claim to any truth, as I seriously doubt Will Scarlet quoting modern movies (A Beautiful Mind) or having a popstar, Alan Doyle or Allan A'Dayle as his character is named, as one of his band. But as I said before, it is entertaining, and that is what matters.7/10",Robin Hood
59,ShelbyTMItchell,Character Development It Lacked! Action Good Though!,6,9 June 2010,"As much as I like Ridley Scott and Russell Crowe. And the action was really well. Let me give you all some advice for those who haven't seen it. Don't get up to use the bathroom. As you need to sit through it as the movie was pretty much confusing. The action was there and all of that. But the plot and most of all, character development was lacking. We didn't get to know these characters like we should. Had they cut some of the action out. And Mr Scott has his reasons for it. And put in more character development. Then the story and action would be matched with it. Don't blame the actors but it is the script. That really got in the way of things. It is ""Gladator"" meets ""Braveheart!"" Despite it being rated PG-13 due to action sequences and some sexual scenes. There is hardly, if rarely, any foul language. Good action but don't spend $7 to see it. As it was pretty confusing as heck. Over the action sequences and lack of character development. Wait for this on DVD.",Robin Hood
60,Samiam3,"Robin Hood retold, superficially enjoyable, but lacks important ingredients",6,22 August 2010,"Ridley Scott's take on Robin Hood tries above all else to breathe new life into the tale. As a medieval epic the film is credible on screen, but on the pages, it is questionable.Like Scott's previous epic Kingdom of Heaven, Robin Hood has an uneven story line, which denies coherency, characterization, and heart. What is also aggravating is the fact that such a talented cast goes pretty much to waste. Russell Crowe is broody and far too introverted to find motivation that would transform him into the selfless hero of legends Cate Blanchett's portrayal of Maid Marion, reeks of 21st century pro-feminist mindset. Why is she wielding a broadsword, riding strait-saddle, in a suit of armour that would drag her to the ground? The movie is at its best during the battle sequences. It is here when Robin Hood comes alive. Scott constructs a rousing climax on a beach that resembles the siege of France that opened Saving Private Ryan, Robin lets loose an arrow that flies a mile high into the air before descending and finding its mark in an enemy's throat. It is a highly unbelievable moment but it works because it is the stuff of legends; A shot that could only be made by the greatest archer who ever lived.But Robin Hood has seen better days. This attempt at an origin story falls story of doing its subject justice.",Robin Hood
61,davidmvining,"Underrated, beautiful, and exciting",7,22 November 2019,"I am, of course, a Ridley Scott fanboy, but I don't love everything he's ever made. In fact, one of his movies that's most often held up as a jewel of his career (Gladiator) I find boring. I overall genuinely think that he's one of the most talented filmmakers working today. With that being said, let's dive into one of his more recent historical epics that I feel was unfairly maligned upon its release.ThemeWhen thinking of the theme of the Robin Hood story in general, it usually gets boiled down to ""Steal from the Rich and Give to the Poor"", which I find simplistic and easily used to justify a terrible morality. Looking at previous incarnations of the Robin Hood tale on the silver screen (in particular the Errol Flynn starring The Adventures of Robin Hood), there's usually a dramatic emphasis on freedom from oppression, but through having the right king in charge. Richard is seen as the savior that England is waiting upon to free the people from the tyranny of John. The story itself is traditionally very pro-monarchy.Ridley Scott's movie is decidedly not that. Richard isn't some great man sneaking his way home, he's a violent, vengeful drunk trying to pillage French castles to pay for his return home from the Crusades. I think John comes off a bit better in this version than normal since he's not usurping the thrown, he genuinely ascends to it through Richard's death. The third monarch in the movie, Philip of France, is trying to incite a revolt in England in order to make the country much more ripe for invasion. What I came away from with this movie the first time I saw it was how decidedly anti-monarchical it was, and it had been directed by a Knight of England, no less.That negative depiction of kings is important to the thematic core of the film. Robin isn't a nobleman brought to action because his land was stolen by a usurper king, fighting to return the rightful king so he can, implicitly, get all of his stuff back. No, Robin is a commoner fighting for ""liberty by law"".The key comes in the quote that comes up frequently throughout the movie, ""Rise and rise again, until lambs become lions."" It's written on the hilt of the sword that Robin takes back to Nottingham, and it was a line written by Robin's father. It was the idea that lambs (the common people) should continue to fight against oppression (kings) until they become lions themselves (self governance).Commoner vs. NoblemanOne of the complaints with the film when it originally came out was that it overcomplicated and changed the origin of Robin. He starts the movie as Robin Longstride, a common archer in the king's army returning from the Holy Land. Robert Loxley is an advisor and friend to Richard who is tasked with returning the king's crown upon his death. Robert dies en route, and Robin takes up the mantle selfishly. He disguises himself and his band of merry men as knights, bound for England with the crown and all the loot they can carry, making their home country wealthy men. Robert's dying words, though, get a promise from Robin to return Robert's sword to his father. Robin, of course, takes up the task, and that is how he gets to Nottingham and meets Marian Loxley.That does seem overcomplicated, especially when compared to the simplicity of the original tellings, but I think it adds a new dimension to the story.No longer the nobleman fighting for his stuff, he's a commoner fighting for the basic rights that every man deserves. This outlook really comes to its culmination at a speech in Barnsdale. King John is trying his poorly best to head off a rebellion of the barons when Robin gives his big speech.John has a line that I consider key: ""A castle for every man?"" Take that single line out and think about it. It's the perfect distillation of the ""Take from the Rich and Give to the Poor"" mentality. He's asking Robin if that's what he wants directly. Robin responds with, ""In England, every man's home is his castle."" Robin isn't asking for more stuff, he's asking for freedom.
It's a much better message overall, and it's a much more mature take on the Robin Hood legend.LookIf it's a Ridley Scott movie, so it's going to look good. Robin Hood is no exception.All of his historical movies share a gritty, grimy, but painterly and polished look that I simply love. They are all expensive, and they look like so much of the budget goes into costumes, sets, and smoke machines instead of digital effects (there's plenty of that too, to be sure).I couldn't tell you how much of some shots are real or digital, but they're so dense with texture and visual information.Just look at the detail and classical framing that provides clear spatial relationships and depth of field. Look at how big everything looks so easily.
How good Ridley Scott's movies look are one of the reasons that I always find something to enjoy about them.Not PerfectI really like this take on the Robin Hood tale overall, but the movie is not without its flaws. One of the best parts of the movie is also one of its worst: Marion Loxley. Marion in this movie is a woman who married her husband just to see him leave for the Crusades within a week of their wedding. She's been living with Sir Walter Loxley, her father in law, ever since, negotiating a hard life under a massive tax burden from the state to fund the Crusade with a few hard years on their harvest and corrupt local officials (in particular from the sheriff, of course). She's become very independent, especially after Walter was struck blind, leaving the running of the estate to her. Her interactions with Robin when he arrives bearing her husband's identity are fun.But then the movie tries to make her into an action star, and it's just...ridiculous.A quick comment on the difference between the theatrical and unrated cuts. The single largest addition to the unrated cut of the movie is to add more to the subplot about the children of Nottingham who have run away from home and become pillagers living in Sherwood Forest (an obvious first step towards the Merry Men). In the theatrical cut, they appear once in the beginning, get referenced a few times, and then, almost inexplicably, show up for the final battle against the invading French army with Marion riding a steed in full armor leading them. The unrated cut just adds more scenes around these kids, but their addition to the final battle is still inexplicable.Her addition to the final battle could have been so easily cut out of the end result by simply pulling the shots she's in. She's not integral to how the battle plays out at all. All of that makes me think that some producer forced Scott to include Marion in battle, and he said, ""Fine, if I have to do it, she'll be useless and her addition will be funny at best.""So, why?Why review Robin Hood at all? A couple of reasons. The first is that I do think it's underappreciated. It's not perfect, but it's smarter than people insist.Roger Ebert taught me how to watch movies, and one of his favorites was The Adventures of Robin Hood with Errol Flynn. He once wrote that on good days his favorite movie was Citizen Kane, but on bad days it was The Adventures of Robin Hood because of its ability to cheer him up. That affection for the ""original"" really colored his viewing of Ridley Scott's take. He insisted that the tale of Robin Hood should be fun and the fact that the 2010 movie wasn't fun meant that it wasn't good. We're all human, and I think that Ebert's affection for the Errol Flynn version blinded him to the qualities that are actually to be found here.The second reason I bring it up is to try and convince a few of you to check it out. Just remember, watch the theatrical version, it's still not perfect, but it's got a wonderfully mature message about the common people, the preference of self-governance to dictatorial rule, and the general inappropriateness of the rule of kings.",Robin Hood
62,TheOneThatYouWanted,Right..,5,14 September 2020,"The good actors, the good director, the good budget are all wasted on a script that is so far from the original story that the majority of the film is spent in dialog mean to explain the weak plot. The film just shows that a script is the most important part of a movie.",Robin Hood
63,Blueghost,Not the worst film I've ever seen.,1,22 June 2011,"But it certainly wasn't the best. I just don't get how a film like this gets made, and by one of the premier commercial film makers of this century; Ridley Scott. How does it happen?I won't repeat a lot of the criticisms I've read since this film came out, but I will say this; Ridley Scott, the man who brought us Kingdom of Heaven, who's big on medieval themes of all kinds, seemed to succumb to some outside forces who cajoled mister Scott into including all kinds of elements into his film that seem extraneous. Films by marketing committee are not good films. The marketing psychologists who were in the back office or even on the set, ruined what might have otherwise been a real sterling film. Note the message of ""lay down your arms and domesticate yourself"" at the end. Note how we never see the classic Robin Hood of tales of old actually steal from the rich and give to the poor. Note how, as was mentioned in other reviews, we have the French landing a-la D-Day, and note how the female lead and her brood help save the day. The gist here being that Ridley let ""homages"" be paid to other commercial successes at the time, and let someone manipulate his film.One wonders how a story like this every got passed whatever execs were in charge of production. As I sat there watching the film I really didn't have any ""Awe, come on!"" moments. I just sat there wondering when the film was going to actually start. Where was the adventure? Where were the heroics? When was the cliché stuff going to be put to an end? Where's the Ridley Scott I know? This truly isn't his film ... is it?But it is.A top notch cast and art direction can only carry a movie so far. People want traditional values from a time immersed in tradition. But this film isn't about chivalry and damsels in distress. It's really about nothing. There's no real theme to focus on. Oh sure, we have Crowe playing the noble faux-knight (untrue for the real Robin of Loxley; i.e. Robin Fitsooth, who was an actual knight), but it's like he was born anointed in the code of chivalry. The script and whatever marketing forces were operating here, really needed to be tossed out the window. Scott just should have bought the property, said yes to the author, then hucked his script out the window, and used the old shooting script from the classic Robin Hood with Errol Flynn and Olivia DeHavilland. Forget all the domestication crap, forget marketing homages to various WW2 films at the time, forget the pro- feminist thing, just tell the story of a knight fighting the king for god's sake. That's what people paid to see.I know it's what I wanted.Still, the film was finely crafted, and I'm not angry nor terrible disappointed I saw it. But, if you have to see it, then remember the reviews that came before mine.Well, I've seen worse films. But then again, I've seen better.",Robin Hood
64,RatedVforVinny,A disappointing effort from R. Scott.,6,29 May 2020,"The trouble of reviewing any Ridley Scott epic, is you naturally compare it to the masterpiece 'Gladiator'; or any of his Sci-Fi movies to the jaw-dropping 'Alien' (or Blade Runner); so on this basis they are pretty much all doomed to a failure. 'Robin Hood' on its own is far less coherent and some parts make no sense at all. Crowe who is usually brilliant seems rather flat and even out of condition, whilst the great Max Von Sydow, can only elevate the production to a slight degree. My 10 year old son spotted that the beach craft from the French style D-Day landings were in fact from WW2 (which was a bit later than the 14 hundreds). Some of the battle action was pretty exciting but that was the very least you would expect and especially at the cost of such a huge budget.",Robin Hood
65,richard-1787,A disappointment,4,17 May 2010,"A great deal of talent and, I understand, money went into this movie. It's a shame it didn't result in a better picture.There is no point in comparing it to other movies about Robin Hood, as it isn't trying to be those. Suffice it to say that if you like vivid Technicolor, this is not the movie for you. The 1938 version with Erol Flynn probably had more color in any one frame than this movie does in its entire 2+ hour length.Rather, if it failed, for me, it was that the story and most of the characters were never really interesting. We learn, very late on, that Robin saw his father killed, but while there are a few flashbacks to that before, nothing is really done with it.King John sometimes appears to be intelligent and clever, as when talking to his mother, Eleanor of Aquitaine - who here is nothing but the palest of shadows of how she was written and portrayed in A Lion in Winter; not the actress's fault, but the script's. Other times, as when he is made to look foolish just before the battle with the French, we wonder if he is really the same man. John may not have been a likable sort, but he was no man's fool, and making him appear to be one, while it might amuse some of the younger than 16 crowd, doesn't do the movie any favors.That battle with the French, by the way, is a real missed chance. The French arrive before what looks like a dark version of the Cliffs of Dover, rather like an inversion of the Normandy invasion. The English, led by Robin and the Marshall, station archers atop the cliffs, where they would be able to pick off the French like goldfish in a bowl. But then the English also descend to fight the French in hand-to-hand combat on the beach. The Germans didn't do that at Omaha Beach, and it makes no sense that the English would have done it either.Then, after a largely unbelievable fight between Robin and Geoffroy on the beach and in the water, Maid Marion is evidently killed. Robin, after having dispatched Geoffroy with a long arrow shot that is right out of The 300 and about as realistic, carries her off in mourning. Yet a few scenes later she is quite alive, living with Robin in Sherwood Forest. Did they change the script on that point as they were shooting? I could go on about unrealistic and confusing features, but you get the point.Russell Crowe and Cate Blanchett are fine actors, of course, as is William Hurd and Max von Sydow; Ridley Scott is certainly a fine director. They just don't have much to work with here, no interesting characters or plot development. The culprit, in the end, is the script, which is lifeless. But the real question is: why did anyone want to make this movie? What did they think would capture an audience's attention and interest? There is nothing unusual or interesting here. Just a lot of dimly lit scenes that don't seem to go anywhere.All that talent could have, and has, produced a lot better.",Robin Hood
66,ArtVandelayImporterExporter,Robin Dire,3,29 October 2019,"Dark, moody, depressing and indecipherable. And that's just Russell ""Mumbles"" Crowe. What language was he speaking, anyway?

Props to Max Von Sydow, who is, as always, the best thing in the movie. That man is almost certainly the most under-rated actor of this, and maybe any, generation.
Robin Hood is a completely invented figure, so I can't blame Ridley Scott for pretty much making up this story whole cloth. But I'll take the Sir Walter Scott romantic Robin Hood any day, thank you very much.",Robin Hood
67,p-stepien,Robin the Braveheart,3,24 December 2010,"Robin Hood aka Robin Longstride aka Robert Loxley is back in new skin and with new credentials. Wearing the green tights is Russell Crowe, while his opposite sword slashing maiden Marion is Cate Blanchett. In this outing Robin and his merry men are soldiers returning from the mad crusade escapades of Richard the Lion Hearted. As per history Richard dies while trying to rampage a castle on his way back from the Holy Land. As in history books he gets killed while making fun of a crossbow wielding cook. But that's as far as history is sound is this movie, as it turns out that Robin by chance takes on the guise of Robert Loxley, a knight who was charged with returning the crown to England. Fate brings him to Sherwood and Nottingham, where he is forced to pretend to be the dead knight and soon his swords and frightfully rare arrows come in contact with French pretending to be Brits, King John and... basically Robin Hood saves the crown, England and has the magnitude of Braveheart and Rob Roy combined...By chance I didn't watch this extremely long movie at one go, as I had to turn it off about an hour before the end of its running time. Up until than I was presently surprised by the gritty realism (even if half-hearted manipulation of history books slightly put me off). Oh and how I wish I didn't finish the movie. There is something very bad with this attempt by Ridley Scott at making an epic historical movie. The main gist is that this is Robin Hood - outlaws in the wood, a skilled archer, guerrilla fighting with the Sheriff and King John's people. In this movie we have an epic dearth of such Robin of the Hood. Instead we have epic battles (with a ridiculous archer vs foot soldiers reinscenisation of the Battle of Normandy).I don't also mind slight renditions on history, but why the hell did Robin suddenly become a figure of historical proportions, who singlehandedly saved the crown and was key in introducing Magna Carta? Quite ridiculous script that not even Ridley could save from bringing out tirades of hysterical laughter - the last 20 or so minutes I couldn't help by keeping the tears from my eyes. In the end a really pathetic movie, which sometimes shows what it could have really been (when Robin Hood really is Robin Hood, not some saviour of the crown). As it is the Sean Connery King Richard the Lion Hearted zombie version with Kevin Costner remains by far a superior movie.",Robin Hood
68,Easygoer10,Give Me Errol Flynn,6,9 June 2019,"This is a woeful waste of time and money by Ridley Scott. As much as I loved ""Gladiator"" (2000), which I thought Joaquin Phoenix should have won Best Actor (Crowe did), I think ""Kingdom of Heaven"" (2005) is a much better film; especially the extended cut, which is an epic 3+ hours, and much different film than the theatrical version. Which brings me to this. I really don't like it. It is not half as good as either of those films, & simply fails, completely. This was released when William Monahan directed his 1st film, ""London Boulevard"", which is brilliant. A dark comedy/gangster film, that works splendidly. Everyone in the key roles is superb: Keira Knightly, Colin Farrell, Ray Winstone, David Thewlis, Anna Friel and Ben Chapman; they are absolutely great, plus the smallish supporting cast. Graham King prduced it, and I love it. Next to ""In Bruges"", it is 1 of my favorite films with Farrell, and Ms. Knightly as well. Regardless, this version of Robin Hood just doesn't work for me. I would skip it.",Robin Hood
69,eric262003,Film With Really Not Much By Way of Significance,6,8 February 2021,"I understand perfectly well the life itself is one big gamble. Movies themselves are a gamble depending on the success in regards to how much people will pay to see the movie of their choice. If it's a hit it will make you, if it's a failure it will break you. But movie fans still come to the movies, not just for escape, but particular films that have been adapted many times before will want to see if the adaptation was told in terms of accuracy, expectancy and execution. The ""go for broke"" ideology has been trending in the movies for many years by taking a classic story and creating new hooks and interpretation that might be praised by critics by taking something old and making new twists around it, or it can anger some who will likely pinpoint the inaccuracies of the story they grown up with. Under the direction of Ridley Scott, this 2010 version of ""Robin Hood"" has to be one of the more insignificant adaptations of the classic tale with a different take and look that thinks way outside the narratives where creative liberties take over from a literature accuracy.Scott once gain collaborates with Russell Crowe to create a newer, but not so brighter interpretation of ""Robin Hood"" by making it more historically accurate which makes each settings authentic knowing the time period of this classic tale while at the same time taking out too many elements of fantasy-fiction that made this tale so beloved. It's like everything you loved about the Errol Flynn classic Robin Hood was thrown out the window giving Ridley Scott too much creative licensing to make this in no way feel like a Robin Hood story. We get the feeling that Scott was intending this story to be an origin story that sees him returning home to Nottingham, England after fighting with King Richard the Lionheart (Danny Huston) in the Crusades and the events that led to him becoming an outlaw and the deceitful French subterfuge and convoluted leadership with his Merry Men.The final product of this movie is faintly undefined, it's flabbergasting. It may have the sets and costumes like you would expect from a 12th century standpoint that this story is set in, but the alternate historical context isn't fully enlightened making it more mundane and labouring to watch. In replacement to the immaculate confides of the Sherwood Forest and the town of Nottingham with its green backdrop and more storybook like atmosphere from the Errol Flynn interpretation, we get a more dark and grittier locale and our antagonist isn't the lovable anti-hero committing sin for the charitable contribution of donating to those fortunate deprived souls. No Crowe portrays Robin Hood as a self-contained, intense warrior who seems perpetually scowl-faced who's destined to have King John (Oscar Isaac) sign the Magna Carta and to join them in the fight against France. Even the citizens are all dressed in tattered clothes and wallow in their filth as the skies are darkened by continual downpours on the cobbled streets below. Granted I'm okay with retelling a fictional tale with some historical references added into the narrative, but does it have to be executed with extreme melancholy? It just ruins the fun and spontaneous settings that symbolize the lore and fantasy of the classic story completely.The thing that turns me off of this adaptation is that screenwriter Brian Helgeland makes Robin's origin story so poorly structured. Robin Longstride returns home from the Crusades and is unexpectedly attacked by the French military. A dying knight, Robert Loxley (Douglas Hodge) permits Robin to take his identity and to return the sword home to his dying father's estate in Nottingham and to ensure his elderly father Walter (Max Von Sydow) that the Loxley's land is secure from being stolen.So begins Robin fighting against the system by becoming an outlaw, where he becomes acquainted by Maid Marian (Cate Blanchett) and becomes entangled in conflict with the incompetent newly crowned King John (Oscar Isaac). By the time the centrepiece of this narrative comes around we are clocking into the hour and half minute mark. While this is commecing we are unceremoniously serenaded with cultural singing and dancing and political overlords intoxicating the civilians with their authoritarian intentions all the while Robin walks around with anger in his blood.The thing about this movie is that although the settings and props seem in place, the dedication doesn't feel leisurely but more obligated in its intentions. It feels as though Scott and Crowe would rather be doing something else besides this project. Sure there are climactic battles and lots of intensity delivered, but nothing really screams out a lot because the head seems to be work and the heart seems to be sitting out. Which is sad because on the technical level the set design, costumes and the view from King John's castle was really impressive.Performance wise, every character does what the material that's given to them. Even through his unenthusiastic approach, Crowe can still turn in a great performance. Blanchett might take her approach in a more nuanced matter, she can still inject a little fun into her role adding more dimension than other Maid Marian's before her. As for Max Von Sydow, he's still a legend in the film industry as he makes all of his scenes and characteristics authentic and noble.It's sad that a film of this calibre is not from the heart and that the delivery lacked the passion that the classic fictional story invokes. I'm okay with the concept of taking an old story and adding new ideas to the narrative. I just wished a lot more passion was put into it. It would've made a big difference.",Robin Hood
70,pc95,Over-Trodden and Miscast,5,22 June 2012,"Riddley Scott directs this handsome update to the (at least) several predecessor films done before it. The scenery and settings are magnificent to be sure, but the story itself does not keep up with it's scenery. Crowe plays his standard brooding character at direction of Scott, and likely is miscast here. While the story is supposed to be a preamble to the original well-known one, ""Robin of the Hood"" is sort of somber and reflective character, nothing of what we've come to know, and non-linear and false to the original imo. So while this new movie isn't terrible, it doesn't follow the spirit of the original sort of like what the James Bond movies have done to the old. It feels like a letdown as does so many redone films these days. Film-makers more and more try to recreate or refresh old premises instead of venturing into new ones. Despite its' problems, production values like costuming and sets are quite good. Action sequences though are less so, as Scott cannot match his action scenes in his earlier Gladiator at all. Maybe worth one watch, but only one.",Robin Hood
71,lewiskendell,Uninspired.,5,5 March 2011,"""To be hunted all the days of his life, until his corpse unburied, is carrion for foxes and crows.""A few tips for getting the most enjoyment possible out of Robin Hood:1. Forget that it's an adaptation of Robin Hood, entirely. Just pretend like it's a middling medieval drama/adventure movie starring Russell Crowe and Cate Blanchett (who's spectacularly underused), with some very vague connections to the Robin Hood legend. Everything is changed about, added too, and embellished beyond recognition. There's nothing wrong with trying to put a fresh spin on an old tale (if it works), but you'll be greatly disappointed if you expect any more than loose connections to the well-known versions of the adventures of Robin Hood and his Merry Men. 2. Don't expect Gladiator in England. Robin Hood desperately tries to be epic, sweeping, grandiose, and politically involving, but it doesn't come near the heights of the mega-popular, critically beloved Gladiator. It's not a bad movie, and you could enjoy it (if you keep your expectations at a reasonable level), but it's okay at best and deeply flawed at worst. Crowe doesn't put half the heart, passion, or effort into Robin Longstride that he did into Maximus. The characters are one-note and static, and the plot is overly-ambitious and needlessly complex. There is less than zero chemistry between Crowe and Blanchett. Robin's back-story was a contrived mess that added nothing to the movie except empty minutes to the running time. The main flaw with Robin Hood is that it's so preoccupied with being serious and deep, that it forgets to be fun. There's nothing wrong with trying to take a story like this in a more realistic direction, but there needs to be a rousing adventure at its heart. That's what's missing from this film. Robin Hood is a shadow of Gladiator. It's a shadow of Kingdom of Heaven, to be honest. But there are moments when the battles are raging and you forget that this is supposed to be Robin Hood, when it's an okay movie. My review seems horribly negative and that's not my intention - my expectations for this were just really high. It felt like Ridley Scott really didn't try all that hard, and the cast and crew followed his example.",Robin Hood
72,winner55,"Sorry, there is no Chapter Two",6,1 June 2010,"Ridley Scott gave us one of the most impressive historical epics of the new century in KIngdom of Heaven. Although painted in bold strokes that danced at the edge of historical (in)accuracy, that film remained doggedly realistic and yet splendidly bold in its realization of the medieval gestalt; it kept its distance from the ideologies portrayed, and thus allowed the characters to live out their own stories unbeset by modern judgments.Robin Hood is an exciting medieval combat film - basically an action film - but if director Scott and writer Helgeland intended anything more from it, they failed. There's still realism here, but historical accuracy has been completely discarded. So too has the legend of Robin Hood with which we are all familiar. Well, that's not quite fair; what Scott and Helgeland have decided to give us is the (possible) pre-history to the legend. In other words, the Robin Hood story we're all familiar with doesn't happen in this film, but after it. And part of the failure of the film is that we don't really learn this until the very end of the movie - until then, we can easily be convinced that we're watching some Hollywood rewrite gone sour - rather like those ""based on the novel"" movies that have nothing to do with the novels they're supposedly based on. But at the end of Robin Hood, we finally discover that we haven't really been watching an ""adventures of Robin Hood"" adaption at all, but ""how eventually a great warrior became Robin Hood; who, you ask? see Chapter Two."" Except of course there is no ""Chapter Two;"" no previous Robin Hood film could adequately follow this, and this film will likely have no sequel.That is the problem with these ""origin of"" movies: unless the sequel is already paid for and in production, they're pointless. In the '80s, a well-made film based on the old radio/pulp novel series The Shadow wasted half its time ""originating"" the main character. Of course no one was interested in the origin of the Shadow, so there wasn't enough interest in a sequel. And while there's enough action in the Scott Robin Hood to invite interest in a sequel, it won't be made, because sequels are not what Scott, Helgeland, or star Crowe do. So, since this is in many ways a revision of the foundations of the legend, without a sequel justifying that revision (which we know will not be made), it is pointless. Again, to put it simply, this is the first chapter in a story which has no Chapter Two.Disappointing, to say the least. In fact a far more disappointing attempt at an epic than last year's Red Cliff by John Woo. Woo, after all, set his sights pretty high - he wanted at last to compete with Kurosawa's Ran, and with the stunning Chinese epic Hero. He failed because the depths of those films were beyond his capacities, but he achieved a certain nobility in the attempt. Scott, who has already achieved that level of epic film-making in Kingdom of Heaven and Gladiator, here produces a film more disappointing exactly because we know he could have given us a greater film and has decided to leave us with a rather expensive actioner instead.So, although occasionally confusing and manipulative, this is an entertaining film to be sure - Scott has enough experience, I doubt he could make a bad film unless he intended to do so. But, no, it's not Robin Hood. It's a film about the Magna Carta, and a brief war between England and France, and in the next film - oops, there is no next film.Great battle sequences, though.",Robin Hood
73,bob-rutzel-1,Very good epic,9,23 September 2010,"Robin (Crowe) brings the crown of King Richard the Lion Heart to the now new King John; the dying son of Sir Walter Loxley (Von Sydow) asks Robin to return the sword he stole from his father to Sir Walter; Sir Walter wants Robin to pretend to take the place of his dead son and marry up with Marion so his lands won't be lost to the king; Robin convinces King John to sign a declaration that all Englishmen are free and not slaves to the king. He does this before the big battle with the French. What a guy !Okay, now one more time: who is Robin Hood? He steals from the rich and gives to the poor.He what and what? Yeah, not here. You must be thinking of another Robin Hood. The one in the fairy tale you read as a kid. Maybe you saw the television show too many times. This was a great epic. It had almost everything. It had the story before Robin Hood became a legend. How did that happen? Well, it's all in the telling, boys and girls. The acting, was great. No real stand-out except for perhaps Von Sydow, who reminded me of John Huston and Patrick McGoohan ..in their later years, of course. Simply great and yes, I'd give an Oscar nod to him . Mark Strong who played Godfrey, is becoming our favorite bad guy. He's everywhere and does an excellent job. Hurt (William Marshal) and Blanchett (Marion) gave solid performances. The stunts as complicated as they appeared to be were perfect. The music could have been more profound, epic like. The cinematography, whether with CGI or not, was fantastic throughout. Just one thing. In the beginning it was hard to understand what anyone was saying and Russell Crowe needs to key in on this as mumbling in major movies won't cut it. But, by the second half it didn't matter as you knew what was going on, but in the first half I had to say, ""waddie say?"" many times and rewind and make the sound louder so I could get it. And, I gave you what I gave in the first paragraph so you wouldn't have to rewind like I did many times. But, I didn't tell you everything. Yes, epics are a little long. But now, when you are asked who is Robin Hood, you will stop and think a little more. What a guy !Violence: Yes. Sex: No. Nudity: No. Language: No.",Robin Hood

The movie starts off with the historical events happening in England & shows French forces plotting against England and after almost one and half hour the movie turns into the Robin Hood fantasy world. Though this Robin Hood world seems like set up in the times of Queen Elizabeth or Gladiator perhaps. It's hard core, brutal and nothing like Robin Hood we have seen before. Though, Ridley Scott manages to put Robin Hood and his disciples singing and dancing talent by showing them in the movie from time to time singing and dancing. The whole movie runs for 2/1 hrs and to be honest I quite enjoyed it; I don't know what's wrong with the critics who are whining for another Gladiator from Ridley Scott and Russell Crowe. The movie is not unique in its substance but at least the way Ridley Scott created Robin Hood's origin is admirable. Russell Crowe Acted well, I've never been his fan. His work in Gladiator and A beautiful mind is surly outstanding but in other movies just like Gerard Butler he has the same mushy face which just never work for me. In Robin Hood he did much better job then expected. Though, his collaboration of English, Scottish and Irish accent is quite confusing. Cate Blanchett is made for the hardcore historical movies and after Elizabeth she did again fantastic job and I loved her witty attitude. Oscar Isaac cunningly plays the lousy King John in the movie. I loved him in Agora and I am really glade to see that Hollywood is seeing his talent. Lea Seydoux caught my eyes in her small role in Inglorious Bastards, she is extremely gorgeous and exquisite and leaves strong impact in small role yet again. I am fed up of watching Mark Strong in every Big budget movie with his same Bald look & face. Hollywood should look for some other big bad guy. All the other supporting actors did a good job. Overall it's really a good movie which didn't bore me and with its Story, Action and wit, it's quite enjoyable. Watch it you guys will love it.",Robin Hood
75,Howlin Wolf,Robbin' Hood...,7,16 June 2010,"I liked the film fine, but I can also see the other side of people's disappointment, even if I don't share it. It seemed a bit silly using the name they did, when the title only really comes into play right at the end, as a cliffhanger for a mooted follow-up.You have to leave as many of the audience as you can satisfied with the original first, before you can justify a sequel. It's pointless leaving the meat of a story for a later date, when you don't even know if there'll turn out to be a demand for further explanation. It's a bit presumptuous when it feels more like a setup for a saga than a self-contained film that tries to tie all of its threads together in one go. You make a sequel because there is a public appetite for it; you shouldn't just get granted the licence for one because you didn't do a good enough job of showing the evolution of a character arc in one sitting.You don't make movies based upon 'probably'... You have to begin the project thinking that this is the only chance you're gonna get. The people who think it's acceptable to be fed little snippets of information in dribs and drabs, are the ones who have money to burn... Most casual moviegoers don't share that sense of inbuilt patience that looking at this film needs. It's not that they ""don't understand""; it's that they don't agree with the approach taken. They get the intention fine, they just feel differently about it than I happen to.If I were guaranteed right now that this film wasn't going to get a sequel, then I would feel it was a bit of a redundant exercise... It's an interesting enough story, but one that doesn't merit the name it's been given as bait to pull in unsuspecting customers.As someone who would like to be considered a film historian, I do find it interesting to look at within the context of both past and future; it's Scott playing with the mythical side of history and trying to make his own ""Braveheart 2"". He's clearly seeking permission for the expansion of a property that dealing with matters of historical fact doesn't allow for as easily. It's interesting for me to spend time pondering his overall scope, but if I saw myself as the average person on the street who was looking for nothing more than a one-off good time, then I don't think that this film caters for that market especially well.",Robin Hood
76,Troy_Campbell,"By no means perfect, but an exciting romp nonetheless.",7,19 May 2010,"The latest from the Russ and Rid team has inevitably drawn comparisons with one of their previous collaborations, Gladiator. A buffed up Crowe as a forced upon hero, gritty encounters with ancient instruments of death, a vile ruler who scares people into respect, a story where fiction and non-fiction blur: the similarities can't be denied. Parts of this picture were even shot on the same location as the opening battle sequence of the Oscar winning sword and sandals saga. However it's Gibbo's little history frolic Braveheart that it ends up resembling the most. Either way this latest incarnation of the outlaw who steals from the rich and gives to the poor has some mighty standards to meet.To say that failing those standards makes this a disappointment is far from the truth. Fact is that Robin Hood is a largely entertaining flick that, despite falling short of the aforementioned classics, has plenty to offer. As we all know Scott has a fantastic eye for the spectacular and here his huge-scaled set pieces are fascinating to watch, especially the impressive climactic melee on a picturesque, cliffy beachfront. The first few scenes on foreign shores establishes the coarse settings in which our heroes will inhabit, bringing along a certain type of murky atmosphere which lends itself to the movie well, something cinematographer John Mathieson can take plenty of credit for.The screenplay – which serves as a prologue to the Robin Hood tale we all know – has had several critics frowning upon it, claiming it has nothing to do with the characters and has been used merely as a brand recognition marketing tool. Whatever the intention the script stands up in the final product. It's not overly original and may be rather predictable but it ticks the boxes whole-heartedly and delivers on all the basics of a historical action epic with a handful of humorous moments thrown in for good measure. The less said of the massive flaw near the end which sees Blanchett's character go one step too far, the better.With two Aussies in the lead, the cast is tight and devoid of any major problems. It's terrific to see Crowe in rugged but lovable form again, however he definitely doesn't cut the same figure he did as Maximus. His chemistry and repartee with Blanchett (who is reliable as always) is natural and you get the feeling that their off-screen friendship went a long way in ensuring the comfortable partnership on-screen. AFI winning Isaac is suitably tyrannical and disgusting as the wormy, greedy Prince John whilst veteran thespians Hurt and von Sydow add a level of class as expected. The only possible weak link is Strong, his one dimensional villain doesn't do much other than sneer and scowl.By no means perfect – not even fantastic – nevertheless this bow and arrow romp is an exciting two and a half hours at the cinema.3.5 out of 5 (1 - Rubbish, 2 - Ordinary, 3 - Good, 4 - Excellent, 5 - Classic)",Robin Hood
77,chrichtonsworld,Decent movie but not Ridley Scotts finest hour,6,7 September 2010,When I read that this Robin Hood was less action orientated I was a bit worried. What on earth for story is there to be told that we haven't seen in the other movies about Robin Hood. The answer is nothing.This version wants us to believe that Robin Hood is so much different than the Robin Hood we know. And while it is indeed refreshing to see this take on it. For the overall story it hasn't the slightest effect. The story we are told is not new or even compelling. Luckily there are some great actors who compensate this mess of a story to give it some meat. Max van Sydow comes to mind as one of the highlights in the movie. Personally I enjoyed the movie but expected so much more especially when you compare this to Ridly's earlier work like Gladiator or Kingdom of Heaven. The action scenes were more than decent. Too bad there were so few of them. The lack of action has to be compensated with a better story otherwise what is the point.,Robin Hood

I couldn't compare it to the previous films, but I understand this is a retelling of how Robin came to be who he was. It feels like an epic film, but it drags on a few scenes. There are some intense battle sequences, and some humor. Crowe stars as Robin Longstride, a highly skilled archer who helps fight in battles, along with his 'merry men' Sir Godfrey sends his army to attack the people of Nottingham. At first, Lady Marion doesn't trust Robin, but she soon warms up to him. If you are a hardcore English folklore fan, then you'll probably love ROBIN HOOD!!!",Robin Hood

And to an extent he has succeeded, however; I as a Brit found the accents to be quite awful...Now, I'm willing to look away..but Crowe seems to move from an Irish accent, to a strong Yorkshire accent..Pick one! The actor who played Little John stuck to an Irish accent, but again it's not an authentic Irish accent.

80,TheUnknown837-1,"nothing that hasn't been seen before, but all's well in the hands of the always reliable Ridley Scott",7,4 July 2010,"This ""Robin Hood"" might have been welcomed with better reception if it had the words ""The Beginning"" or ""The Prologue"" jotted down at the end. Then people might have realized what they were getting themselves into and would not have been as disappointed. ""Robin Hood"" is not really focused upon the legend of the outlaw; it's more about the beginning of Robin Hood, tracing back his story, how he *became* an outlaw. I think this was a disappointment for a great many people who waited two and a half hours to see Robin and his merry men robbing the rich and giving to the poor and dodging the sheriff of Nottingham. Well, they do rob the rich (briefly) and do contend with the sheriff (briefly), but most of the movie focuses on developing the past and setting up for the future.I really don't have a whole lot to say about ""Robin Hood."" Most of my comments are similar or identical to comments I've made on other films of recent years. There really isn't anything in this film that has not been seen before. The characters, the story, the battle scenes, the slow-motion shots, the CGI-enhanced landscapes, the corny dialogue, it's all rather commonplace with contemporary cinema. And like many other movies of today that dare to stretch their length, at two and a half hours, it is a tad long.Why the film is saved in the end, I think, is because it is placed in the hands of the competent and always reliable Ridley Scott. Mr. Scott, who has made a string of great movies since ""Alien"" in 1979, pulls off another technically smooth film. Also having directed the superior ""Gladiator"" at the turn of the century, there is a lot of similarity especially in visual terms between that film and this one. Scott's directing is solid, although he allows some scenes, mostly dialogue-dominated moments, drag on for too long. Looking at the film, I picked out a number of scenes that might have been dropped for the better. That is a fault that could be blamed on the director, and perhaps the editor as well. Truth is, ""Robin Hood"" could use some better timing.But there are fun moments throughout the film. The performances by the cast range from passable to very good, and there is a very good final battle at the end of the movie that ironically mirrors images from the Omaha Beach scene in ""Saving Private Ryan"" as opposed to ""Braveheart"" or ""Spartacus"" or ""Gladiator"" like one would expect. There is a flaw in a moment of the climax, when a character (I will not disclose which one) meets his grisly end. A key shot is missing, leaving the audience feeling a little empty and the scene incomplete.I think my point is made. ""Robin Hood"" is an old-fashioned, flawed, incomplete and somewhat empty, but nevertheless enjoyable movie. It is not one that will be remembered for very long and the fact that reception toward it has been very negative questions whether or not a sequel will be made, although it is clear it was intended by the filmmakers for there to be at least one or two more.In regards, to the cast, Russell Crowe is in fine form in the titular role, although he is more or less just playing the same character and facet that he did in ""Gladiator."" I had my concerns about Cate Blanchett playing lady Marion, assuming her to be miscast, but she is also in good shape in the role and has strong cinema presence once again. Veterans Max von Sydow and William Hurt shell out good performances; Mark Strong is sinister as the chief villain; and Oscar Isaac is pleasing in his deliberately exaggerated performance as Prince John. The Sheriff is in the movie, played well by Matthew Macfayden, but again, in a very small role this time around.",Robin Hood

What a shame because they established Robin Hood, King John, The Sheriff, Robins merry men and Sherwood Forrest. After all that, the sequel was ready to go but alas the box office made the final decision. I enjoy Cate Blanchett but in this movie, she tended to ham it up a bit and to people who follow her that is acceptable. For me it was overdone.

82,classicalsteve,"Essentially a Chivalric Romance: Fantastic Reacreation of the Medieval World--Best Since ""The Name of the Rose""",8,5 June 2010,"During the Age of Enlightenment (approximately 1670 to 1800), the medieval world and its literature was dismissed if not vilified. The popularity of chivalric romances had by the late 17th century begun to wain in northern-western European countries, particularly England/Britain and France. The chivalric romance as a viable literary genre began with the Arthurian legends in the late Middle Ages, climaxed with Edmund Spenser's Faerie Queene and similar fair in the late 16th century and sort of ended anti-climatically with Cervantes' satirical Don Quixote. Classical Literature became the rage while the medieval world was sometimes labeled as the ""Barbarous Age"". The Enlightenment dismissed most of medieval culture, including their literature. And then, in the 19th century, interest in what we think of as the Middle Ages suddenly was reborn. Readers, writers, poets, artists and composers alike rediscovered The Arthurian and Chivalric Romances, as exemplified by Tennyson's ""The Lady of Shalott"", the Arthurian paintings by Dante Gabriel Rossetti, and the operas of Richard Wagner. ""Robin Hood"", directed by Ridley Scott and starring Russell Crowe and Kate Blanchett, is essentially born out of the tradition of the medieval chivalric romance and stems from our fascination with the Middle Ages since the 19th century which has continued unabated up to the present time.While some viewers may feel somewhat cheated in the story department as it chronicles the origins of Robin Hood rather than centering on the tales that made him a legend, there is a lot going for the present film. As an amateur medieval scholar, I have seen few films that recreate the medieval world as honestly and accurately as this one, others that come to mind are ""The Name of the Rose"", ""The Lion in Winter"" (which chronicles events just prior to that of ""Robin Hood""), ""Braveheart"" and (ironically) ""Robin and Marion"" (starring Sean Connery and Audrey Hepburn in the famous roles). ""Robin Hood"" is set inside the historical context of the late 12th and early 13th centuries.The real-life Robin Hood is somewhat of a mystery and an enigma whose exploits may be the result of later exaggeration and embellishment. Scholars have revealed two figures who may be the origin of the legendary outlaw: Robert of Loxley and Robin Longstride. The present film incorporates aspects of both figures into a single character, played by Russell Crowe, and it works more or less. The story opens with the military campaign between France and England who have been fighting one another since before the age of the dinosaurs. At the helm is Richard the Lionheart, back from the Crusades and fighting to take Normandy from his adversary King Philip of France. Robin Longstride (Russell Crowe) is in military service on the English side who are sieging a French castle. Richard the Lionheart falls in battle, failing to return to English soil. Robert of Loxley is then slain at the hands of a French ambush, and Robin Longstride comes upon the dying knight. Loxley entreats Longstride to return his sword to his father, Walter of Loxley.Ruling in the king's stead back in London is Richard's brother, John, who becomes the new English monarch and begins his unjust and merciless reign which has become so much entrenched in the legends of Robin Hood. Part of the story relates the real-life threat of civil war between King John and the noble barons who did force the king to sign one of the most famous of documents, the Magna Carta (""Great Charter"") in 1215. The Magna Carta ensured that the barons had certain rights and could not be deprived of their lands and liberty without proper trial. According to the film, King Philip of France has devised a plan to cross the English Channel and conquer England for France in the hopes that the English nobility is splintered. Meanwhile, Longstride honors his vow to return the sword to the family in Loxley where he meets, of course, Marion of Loxley, a.k.a. Maid Marion (Kate Blanchett).The screenwriters are not going to be taking home any statuettes (at least not for this film), but the screenplay is decent, and better than expected with a bit of humor thrown in here and there, although I wish there had been a little more. There is something strangely humorous about the Middle Ages. In the acting department, Crowe holds his own as does Blanchette, although these are not stellar performances. Blanchette's later portrayal in the final battle sequence is decidedly un-medieval, making it appear like she's some kind of medieval feminist. My main criticism is that Little John and Friar Tuk enjoy very little character development, but hopefully this will be corrected in subsequent installments.The real star of the show is the battle scenes, which are probably the most accurate recreations of medieval military conflict on film and some of the most compelling since Excalibur and The Lord of the Rings. The opening sequence alone is worth the price of admission. Overall an enjoyable and better-than-expected film, and certainly a must if you enjoy the medieval world. But don't expect Robin Hood to steal from the rich--yet.",Robin Hood
83,MrGKB,"Ridley Scott outdoes Kevin Reynolds in the ""ludicrous"" storytelling category...",4,8 March 2011,"...with this absolutely horrendous ""re-imagining"" of the Robin Hood fairy tale. Oh, make no mistake, the film-making itself is quite professional, well shot by Scott collaborator, John ""Gladiator"" Mathieson, and art-directed and production-designed to within an inch of its life (never mind the idiotic French ""landing craft""), capably scored by Marc ""American Gangster"" Streitenfeld (who nonetheless should probably stick with music editing and the like), and decently cut by another Scott regular, Pietro ""Gladiator"" Scalia, but it's the storyline and, sad to say, the casting that really drag this ill-conceived mess into the realm of ""polished bolus."" Ted Sturgeon would be nodding knowingly.Let's face it, Russell Crowe and Cate Blanchett have no business playing Robin Hood and (Old) Maid Marion, and especially not within the context of this absurd, pitifully rewritten script (Tom Stoppard should be slapped with a wet fish for his useless contributions, Brian ""Mystic River"" Helgeland should stick with adaptations of non-legendary materials, and the team of Ethan ""Kung Fu Panda"" Reiff & Cyrus ""ditto"" Voris should stick with cartoons). Truth is, Crowe and Blanchett have virtually no discernible chemistry, and are simply far too long in the tooth for the characters they play, never mind that those characters bear virtually no resemblance to the Robin Hood and Marion firmly established in the cultural memory banks. Combined with spurious history, a slathering of anachronisms and outright inventions, this makes for some really bush league entertainment.All I'll say further is that I'm glad I wasn't tempted to see this at the local cinema, and equally glad I saw it for free on video.

He lingered for awhile after a ""butcher"" healer removed the bolt and gangrene set in. He even talked to the crossbowman and let him live. Cate Blanchet is extremely well suited for her role in this film in my opinion. She is not a good looking woman in this role but fits in so appropriately.

87,ajs-10,A different twist on the Robin Hood tale.,8,15 May 2010,"I have been a fan of the work of Ridley Scott for quite a few years now and so I was quite excited to see his latest offering. The story of Robin Hood has been told many times over the years, both as comedies and as more serious films. This rendition is a bit different, in that we are told the story of Robin and his men before they became outlaws.Robin's story begins in France. Having followed King Richard to the Holy Land for the crusades, master longbow man Robin Longstride and the rest of the King's army are heading home. On their way they are pillaging as many French castles as they can. During one of these sieges the king is killed by a crossbow bolt through the neck. His crown is entrusted to Sir Robert Loxley to return to England. A traitor, Godfrey, ambushes him but the attackers do not get away because Robin and his men, Little John, Will Scarlet and Alan A'Dayle, ambush the ambushers. Godfrey gets away but is scarred by an arrow shot by Robin. Sir Robert, mortally wounded, makes Robin promise to return not only the crown to London, but also his sword to his father in Nottingham. Having delivered the crown and seen Richard's brother, John, crowned king, Robin and his men head for Nottingham. There he meets Sir Robert's wife, Marion, and his father, Sir Walter. In order that Marion can hold onto their lands after his death, Sir Walter proposes that Robin stays on and pretends to be Sir Robert. He agrees, partly, I suspect, because he's attracted to Marion. Here we are also introduced to Friar Tuck, who helps Robin take grain intended for the rich bishop in York and plant it in the local fields instead. Meanwhile, Godfrey has gained the new King's confidence, ousted the royal chancellor, William Marshal and set off, with a group French soldiers to 'collect taxes' in the North. Now, I think I've told you enough of the plot, there's a lot more, but I don't want to spoil the ending.I really enjoyed this film, beautifully shot and brilliantly imagined, as we've come to expect from Ridley Scott. There were even some funny moments that were very welcome, we so seldom see little jokes like that in most modern dramas. It did fall a little flat in the middle, but soon picked up when the action got towards the end. Decent performances from all of the major players, Russell Crowe as Robin Longstride, Cate Blanchett as Marion Loxley, Max von Sydow as Sir Walter Loxley, William Hurt as William Marshal, Mark Strong as Godfrey and Oscar Isaac as Prince John. I should also give honourable mentions to; Danny Huston as King Richard The Lionheart, Eileen Atkins as Eleanor of Aquitaine, Mark Addy as Friar Tuck, Kevin Durand as Little John, Scott Grimes as Will Scarlet and Alan Doyle as Allan A'Dayle. Sorry it's such a long list.There has been a lot of talk about accents, particularly that used by Russell Crowe for Robin. To be honest, it didn't really bother me; I didn't find it particularly distracting. Over all I found it quite an enthralling film to watch with plenty of action, although it does fall a bit flat in the middle. Beautifully shot and well directed by Ridley Scott, forgiving the rogue accent problem. I was somewhat taken aback by the events just before the end, but I won't say too much about that (spoilers). Over all, recommended.My score: 7.8/10",Robin Hood
88,MihaiSorinToma,A very good prequel,9,21 October 2017,"After his king dies and he escapes the war camp with three comrades, he witnesses an ambush, exterminates the remaining soldiers and plans to take back the king's crown (which was left in the fight) for a lifetime reward. Not only that his plans don't work accordingly, but he will soon be facing a big threat which puts his own country into peril.This movie realistically covers the adventures of Robin Hood before he began the legend we all know, how he seeks a peaceful life and how he ultimately defends England and is declared an outlaw because of his heroism and bravery. It's emotional with its main character's story, tragic through numerous familiar deaths, atmospheric with the world it creates and even emotional through the lives it describes.Its only problems were that it was somewhat predictable (in part because of its well-known main protagonist) and a bit boring due to its unnecessary length. A very good prequel I must say!",Robin Hood
89,gavin-thelordofthefu-48-460297,"Not a perfect film, but I've seen worse",5,16 May 2020,"This isn't a perfect film as there have been other adaptations of Robin Hood that are much more superior (most notably the Errol Flynn version and the Disney 1973 cartoon which everyone else is familiar with), but consider I saw this twice back in theaters when it came out, I consider this passable. Yes it's understandable why the film suffered from some rewrites which included several story ideas and the fact that Russell and the director Ridley Scott didn't get along very well which affected their relationship. Not to mention the fact that nearly 20 minutes of the film were cut until the home video release. But in all honesty, it's not as bad as some of the other bad movies that came out that year (Jonah Hex, everyone?)Now, before I give this some praise, it does have some problems. While Russell Crowe's performance as Robin Hood is good, his accent did get kind of confusing and the idea of turning Robin Hood into a dark gritty character doesn't work. Also, the chemistry between Russell and Cate Blanchett isn't memorable, and there are some parts in which the story and script didn't flow very well which most likely results in pacing that is a bit too overlong. Not to mention it left the door wide open for a sequel which didn't happen due to the film's under-performance. That's all I have to say for the negatives.Everything else is really good. What I really liked about this film is the political subject matter. Now, I'm not into politics a lot, but it did fit well with the movie. Mostly due to the quote ""Rise and rise again until lambs become lions."" which meant that Robin and the others are willing to fight against the oppression until they become the oppressed. Now, I know many people criticized the subject matter, but I think that's kind of refreshing in a different take on Robin Hood. Now with that in mind, the film is so beautiful to look at. The scenery, the sets, and the costume designs. All perfect which fitted the setting really well. The action sequences, despite some mostly shaky cameras, are great particularly with the archery shots, the music score, while not exactly perfect, is beautiful. Also, the supporting cast does a good job mostly Mark Strong, Oscar Issac, and the late Max Von Sydow (who recently died this year, may he rest in peace).Overall, I understand why many people didn't like this film, but like I said before, I consider this a passable flick with some problems, but with enough good stuff to recommend. To those who have read the history of Robin Hood would probably skip this, but to those looking for some good action and some good supporting actors, give this one a shot.",Robin Hood
90,K3nzit,Mainstream,5,28 December 2019,"I was looking forward to this one as I thought it was going to be a dark movie, when I saw the trailer. Instead Robin Hood turned out to be a pretty mainstream Hollywood flick. Look at the characters of Little John and Friar Tuck. You just can't get any more Disney than that! Oh well, at least it was a better movie than King Arthur, but surely it didn't even come close to Scott's brevious movies like Gladiator and Kingdom of Heaven. Now those are some good movies.",Robin Hood
91,RonellSowes,Bland and dull,3,2 January 2021,"This film saw Ridley Scott and Russell Crowe reunite ten years after the critical and box office hit,Gladiator,in another big budget period piece-Robin Hood. Whatever magic they worked on the previous picture they've(mostly Scott)been unsuccessful in replicating it ever since. Robin Hood isn't a fraction of the film Gladiator was but since this isn't supposed to be what the film is not like let's talk about what it is.
I've lost track of how many Robin Hood movies have been made but I know they stretch back as far as 1938 with Errol Flynn,which set the idea of what Robin Hood is depicted like. Maybe to try something different or perhaps they thought it left more room for a sequel either way,the film serves as a sort of origin story to Robin Hood. Ending with the situation set up as the one we know;living in the forest the Merry Men and hiding from the law. Why that couldn't have sufficed for this film beats me.
The picture is by no means devoid of action yet it still feels very bland and dull. It drags for its entire 140 minute runtime,even when it should be intensifying and speeding along it feels slow. The film has a quality cast lead by Russell Crowe and I don't find any of their performances to be the film's problem. The blame lies more on the writers and Ridley Scott.Most will probably watch this film anticipating something along the lines of Gladiator but be prepared to be disappointed. Robin Hood doesn't hold up to the foregoing's standards,its a poor adaptation of the Robin Hood folklore and it fails as an all around film.",Robin Hood
92,jdkraus,Not bad but it lacks motivation and oomph,5,26 May 2010,"Ridley Scott is one of my favorite directors of all time. Three of his movies are among favorites. But since ""Gladiator"", he hasn't really made anything truly epic. This doesn't mean his past movies are bad they're just not as epic. ""Robin Hood"" unfortunately continues this trend. My greatest fear of this movie was that it was going to be a ""Gladiator 2"", particularly with Russell Crowe in the lead. Fortunately it doesn't run into this issue. Instead, the movie lacks oomph and motivation. There are some great actors in this film, but they aren't at their full potential. Russell Crowe is low-key in this film. He isn't the action hero we remember from Gladiator. This could be because he's a decade older, but when does age hold an actor back from being brilliant? In addition, there's no real motivation in his character. I don't understand why he bad mouths the king and at the same time decides to go on a crusade to save England from French invaders. I wish there was more development in his character, as well as in the others. Cate Blanchett is both beautiful and fierce as Maid Marian. She always makes a great performance, but once again, I wish there was more breathing room for her character to breathe, particularly with her relationship to Robin. In one scene she can't stand him and the next kisses him. What? I think she's past puberty.The other thing that got on my nerves was how the first hour of the film was structured. It jumped around a lot from subplot to subplot. It was difficult for me to keep up. At times it was hard to tell who was on whose side. Then again, the whole film is about scheme and backstabbing. At least the screenwriter tied it all together at the end.In the technical aspects though, this film doesn't lack. There is great production design and costumes that aren't too glamorous (fitting the time period of stark contrast between poor rags and gallant knight armor). I really loved John Mathieson's cinematography. It is beautiful and gritty. I even enjoyed Marc Streitenfeld's score. It was new without relying on the Gladiator tone that I love, but gets overused in many movies nowadays.So, what's opinion on this film? Not too bad but not special either. Since I'm generous, I give it 2.5/4. I enjoyed the time I was in the theater, but I won't buy it when comes out on DVD. On a final note, don't let the PG-13 rating fool you. It may not have lopped off heads or blood spraying in slow motion, but it is still plenty of violent. It's still nowhere near violent on Ridley Scott scale though.",Robin Hood
93,Hayden-86055,Better after a rewatch but don't expect a proper Robin Hood tale,7,3 May 2021,"I'll admit this is a good film, it's not at all like a Robin Hood film and a lot of my favourite characters are sidelined in favour of developing Prince John and others but there is an undeniable effort put into making this, the cinematography is occasionally amazing and mostly good, the music is fantastic and Russell Crowe is a strong lead. Unfortunately this film does carry the Robin Hood label which is a shame because it's really nothing like Robin Hood at all, the characters are there but their individual character is not.The plot's not weak and I did follow it better the 2nd time, I really did want a sequel to this film if they were going to cover the more classic Robin Hood aspects in the next instalment but annoyingly I very much doubt that will happen now.7/10: It is good but not as a Robin Hood film, treat it like a normal medieval flick and you'll have a blast.",Robin Hood
94,Likes_Ninjas90,One of the first great blockbusters of 2010,8,30 May 2010,"In the 12th century Richard the Lionheart (Danny Huston) is killed in battle on his return home from the Crusades. Since his brother John (Oscar Isaac) is a foolish, arrogant and inexperienced replacement, the king of France sees this as an opportunity to invade England. King Philip assigns a spy in Godfrey (Mark Strong) to lead a group of Frenchmen posing as English soldiers to demand taxes across the countryside so that a civil war against John can be sparked. When a group of disbanding soldiers including Robin Longstride (Russell Crowe) witness Godfrey attempting to steal the returning crown, they decide to return the jewel back to England themselves. Robin promises a dying soldier named Robert Loxley that he will return his sword back to his father. Fearing that he and his men will be seen as murderers carrying the King's crown, Robin presents himself as Robert Loxley to the people of Sherwood. His presentation of the sword to Loxley's father (Max von Sydow) is followed by a wish that he become partnered to Marion (Cate Blanchett), a tough and tenacious woman who has struggled physically and mentally in looking after the land and her family.For the past decade, Ridley Scott has been releasing annual blockbusters of varying quality. Commonly, most of these films have demonstrated Scott's ability as a director to construct spectacular action sequences. Yet some have been critical of the conventional nature of these films and their tendency to embrace genre cinema, rather to innovate like the early works of Scott's career. Robin Hood is certainly a genre film and an epic adventure but its strength lies in balancing the spectacle with more thoughtful political tensions. The screenplay by Brian Helgeland, who also wrote Mystic River and L.A. Confidential, has contributed significantly in making this one of the first great blockbusters of 2010. Dating back to 1938 when he was played most famously by Errol Flynn, Robin Hood has regularly been portrayed in films that have been light-hearted and frivolous adventures. As an origin story, the tone on this representation has been deliberately darkened to make this a much grittier story, more inclined to Scott's Gladiator. The aesthetic qualities of the film, such as the muted colour scheme, visualise this as a more authentic representation of medieval England. The persistence of Scott and Helgeland to explore the political tensions, such as the rebellion against taxation, contributes to the film's sense of authenticity and makes this a much grander and more interesting story than if it had solely focused on the evolution of Robin himself. This brand of realism is further extended to the battle scenes as well. The film is violent without being bloody and visceral and exciting without becoming overblown. As expected, the action is handled exceptionally well by Scott, injecting a sense of scale to each of the battles, the best of which is a monumental showdown on a beachhead. The balance between action and the exposition of how Robin came to be amidst these political issues makes the film immensely satisfying and its running time of nearly two and a half hours soars by.Although some have been skeptical about Scott's dependency on Crowe as an actor, this being their fifth film together since Gladiator, the actor is entirely fitting for the way that the part of Robin has been written. Robin is not the acrobatic and dexterous swordsman from the previous incarnations. Instead, he is a man that has been regularly surrounded by violence, right from his childhood when his father was executed. Crowe's career has been finely realised by playing aggressive, fractured men and here he remains skilfully expressive of Robin's internal conflicts. Surprisingly, it is the relationship between himself and Marion which is addressed more intelligently than one has come to expect from genre films like this. Their initially reluctant bond is drawn from the wish of Marion's ageing father-in-law, who insists that they come together so that Marion will not lose the property. Through this motive, a regularly conventional element in the script is delivered with a level of sweetness and poignancy. While Blanchett might at first seem too old to be playing this role, the choice for a more mature actress fits accordingly with the context of the narrative. Marion is portrayed as a woman who has had to regularly endure the emotional and physical strains of looking after her farming property, as well as her separation from her husband and her responsibility for her father-in-law. Blanchett brings an edge and a level of toughness to make one feel for her character accordingly. Amongst these two strong performances is fine support from Mark Strong as the seriously menacing and brooding Godfrey, and Oscar Isaac as the wickedly arrogant John who must come to terms with his own responsibility and power. Max von Sydow is also heartfelt as Marion's father-in-law and there are some clever comic touches from Robin's three friends that ensure than the film does not take itself too seriously.This is a tremendous retelling of a classic story because it refuses to merely be satisfied by the spectacle. The examination of the historical period and the issues of the time realises the values of the characters and allows the audience to feel for them stronger than one normally does in similar blockbuster films and epics. As a specialist in action, Scott also stages the battle scenes beautifully, making this thoughtful and exciting film some of the very best work of the Scott-Crowe partnership since Gladiator.",Robin Hood
95,Christian_Dimartino,Overly long and misses the mark.,5,30 May 2010,"In the past, we have seen numerous film adaptation of Robin Hood.We saw the Deinsey one,the one with Kevin Costner,a french one in Shrek,and now Ridley Scott version,which is an origin story. To tell you the truth,i'd rather had seen a remake of Robin Hood: Men in tights. The new Robin Hood is a disappointment. There is none of that jazz involving Robin stealing from the rich and giving to the poor.It's just Russell Crowe shooting arrows at people's faces. One of the many other problems is there are these long drawn out battles that aren't exciting,then there is a long period where nothing exciting happens. Also,the film feels like an eternity to get through.I won't go through the plot. Because I wasn't very interested in a lot of the film.

96,silverscreen888,A Realistic and Engrossing Film Reviving Costume Drama,8,4 January 2011,"In assessing ""Robin Hood"" (2010) as a project, one must first, I suggest, view it as a film that its creators intended as a tool for reviving the genre, purposes and intentions of ""historical drama"". Writers Brian Helgeland (screenplay and story) and story writers Ethan Reiff and Cyrus Voris recast the Robin Hood legend in three vital ways at least. They made Robin Longstride a commoner, one only impersonating Robert Loxley, hereditary nobleman,at the request of his father to save their property from royal tax collectors. Secondly, they set the film after the death of Richard the Lionhearted, not during his lifetime. And then they laid the groundwork for a period of outlawry for Robin and his forces that would culminate as a ""legend"" in the writing of the Magna Charta forced upon Richard's successor King John by England's barons --nder the leadership of ""Robin of the Hood"" son of a father, a stonemason, who had died for trying to engineer this visionary charter of ""rights"" years before. Russell Crowe and his executive production team working with veteran director Ridley Scott deserve credit for many successes, I claim, not the least of which are the sets, major reimagnings of the Tower of London and entire castles, towns and villages, a Medieval siege, battles, troop landings from the Channel, court ceremonials, towns and forests. So many parts of this alternative history and reconstruction seem to me to work so realistically that there is much praise to distribute to the technical creators. First, there is the stirring but subtle music provided by Marc Streitenfeld, which I found by turns to be subtle and then noteworthy where majesty was implied. Then there was the clean color cinematography achieved by John Mathieson. More than a dozen art directors working together captured a Medieval English look that I suggest has never been surpassed on film, understating much but being as ""colorful"" as necessary as in the final meeting of barons with King John as the savvy could desire. Production Designer Arthur Max achieved an imitable yet original balance of light, nature, landscape and man- made buildings, as a setting for costumes, human forms, animals, etc. throughout. Set decorations by Sonja Klaus and the costumes created by Margarethe Schmoll and Sharon Long contributed mightily to the effect desired by the authors of transporting the viewer to the late 12th Century, but in making it a world where ideas, loyalties and the need for justice are not much different than our own 22nd Century needs for the same human en; this, I assert, was the formula by which Hollywood's filmmakers once circumvented the anti-conceptual bias, totalitarian bigotries and pseudo-puritanism of corporate studio moguls in the past to project an American--not U.S.--constitutional narrative onto past eras. Even more: the makeup, hairstyling, second-unit direction, lighting, sound and rerecording tasks met within the film were in most cases handled with distinction, seconding the believability of the main narrative's effect. Among the actors who helped to bring the story to enacted life on the screen, one must begin with Russell Crowe's sometimes understated commoner Robin played coolly against Cate Blanchett's worldly but noble Marian. Max Von Sydow seemed both noble and from a different, better era as Walter Loxley as did Eileen Atkins as Eleanor of Quitaine. Notable in the cast for their effectiveness were also Mark Strong as Godfrey, Matthew Macfadyen as the Sheriff of Nottingham, Kevin Durand as Little John, Danny Huston as Richard the Lionhearted, Mark Addy as Friar Tuck and Lea Seydoux as Isabella of Angouleme. As the cunning weakling John, Oscar Osaac is occasionally effective, and William Hurt underplays William Marshall with more than customary skill. No one else is given very much to do in this long attempt, but many smaller parts are by my standards well-done. In sum, I wrote at the time I first saw the film that its makers had single-handedly revived the color adventure genre, perhaps a most-welcome leaven to the bad concepts, neocon and altruist ideas, and fantasy-parody bent of film for over the past three decades as a demonstrably viable film choice. What was here expensively produced and used for dramatic effect can elsewhere be used as an antidote to brooding antiselfhoodism and postmodernistic reality- bashing on many occasions, hopefully in the form of westerns, adventures set in the human past and perhaps even idea-level films extending human hopes into a brighter, better future.",Robin Hood
97,DonFishies,"I wanted to give it a chance, but it still let me down",5,12 May 2010,"I did not really know what to expect going into Ridley Scott's rendition of Robin Hood. Outside of the film taking the Batman and James Bond route and creating a vague prequel/reimagining of the character, there was really nothing much going for it. The trailers were action-packed, but none of them really piqued my interest. It looked more like another Russell Crowe period piece ala Gladiator. But when offered advance passes to see the film, I figured it may be worth a look.Before Robin Hood (Crowe) became the courageous and generous outlaw Errol Flynn, Kevin Costner and an animated fox made famous, he was fighting as an archer for the British in a war against the French. Upon return to England, Robin ends up in Nottingham impersonating a dead soldier. As the new King John (Oscar Isaac) begins imposing heavy taxes across the country to pay for the war, the villainous Godfrey (Mark Strong) begins to conspire against his own country. And rather fittingly, Robin is stuck in the middle of it all.The trailers for Robin Hood give an early suggestion for how epic the movie wants to feel. But the epic aura during the film feels forced. There is a simple story at the heart of the film of a man becoming the legend we know him to be. But the film takes so many turns, throws so many characters at us, and becomes so distracted that this simple story is almost nowhere to be found. The first quarter of the film where we are introduced to Robin, his earliest followers and the conflict between the English and the French is handled fairly great and smooth. It goes by quickly, and has a great pacing to it. But as the film starts to give way to multiple story lines and characters, the entire fabric of anything it had going for it crumbles to pieces.The entire middle section of the film, leading up to the final battle scene, is almost agonizing to watch. The actors are attempting to make something of their characters, but what the film seems to think is character and plot development actually seem more like filler. There are easily twenty minutes that could have been chopped right out of this section of the film, and none of it would be missed. The film never puts nearly enough emphasis on anyone but Robin or the future Maid Marion (Cate Blanchett), and even then, it is not nearly enough. Instead, it just jumps from character to character, storyline to storyline, almost absentmindedly. I wanted to feel like I could follow the simplistic plotting and connect the pieces of who each character later becomes in the story, but I just had a hard time trying to comprehend the directions screenwriter Brian Helgeland wants to take the audience. The man knows how to write a movie, and I know Scott knows how to make a movie. So how can we explain how choppy it feels?As Robin Hood, Crowe seems to be offering a mere caricature of his Oscar-winning role as Maximus. His age is not a factor as much as he just does not seem able to really transcend and become the legendary character. While Christian Bale was able to play the confused and borderline psychotic Batman before he became the hero, and Daniel Craig was able to redefine James Bond for a generation, Crowe seems inept at even attempting to try and make us believe this could be Robin Hood. He just lacks the zest and the charisma to make this future outlaw believable. Much the same goes for Blanchett, who seems horribly miscast as a Marion much too close to Eowyn from The Lord of the Rings.The supporting cast, for what they are given, fare a bit better. I would have loved more of Isaac's John, William Hurt's William Marshall, Max von Sydow's Sir Walter Loxley and Matthew Macfadyen's Sheriff of Nottingham. All are excellent in their roles, but are used so sparingly it hurts. Strong is criminally underused as the primary villain in the film, and the focus on the humour involving Mark Addy's Friar Tuck seems a bit too overused. And while enjoyable, I think they could have written a little less humour for Robin's merry men of Kevin Durand, Scott Grimes and Alan Doyle.What I did love was the sound design and score for the film. While everything else seemed to be unraveling at the very seams, both elements of sound seemed to stay consistent and strong. The whizzing arrows, the galloping horses, the smacking swords – all of these sounds are recorded so well and so vividly. I rarely notice the sounds in films, but this one seemed to have a special attention given to them that drew me in right from the beginning. Much the same goes for the pounding score, which is not overly memorable, but is beautifully composed. It knows just the right tone and attitude to go for in every scene, and helped lend some form of reason for the film to be considered an epic.The battle scenes, while reminiscent of Gladiator, are also very well done. The film does not have enough of them, but the lack of blatantly noticeable CGI and amped up grittiness made them another easy highlight for the film. I just wish they were longer.There is some watchability to this mess entitled Robin Hood. It easily could have been much better with more focus and less filler. As it is, this epic is bloated to near disastrous proportions with very few shining elements. It pales in comparison to the massively overrated Gladiator, and in the end, feels like the filmmakers just had no idea what they wanted to do to properly reimagine the legend.5/10.(This review also appeared on http://www.geekspeakmagazine.com).",Robin Hood
98,moviesleuth2,Another Gritty Epic,6,28 May 2010,"""Robin Hood"" is a serviceable movie, but nothing more. It's a gritty, grungy and dark film, and that's okay, I guess. It's definitely not ""Disney-fied,"" although not as violent as the movie's tone suggests. It's sporadically entertaining, but there are plot holes and an extremely limited amount of character development that keep it from being anything more.The film is cobbled together from a lot of other films, most notably ""Rob Roy"" and ""Braveheart."" Robin Longstride (Russell Crowe) is an archer from the English army at the end of one of the many crusades. After the king is killed, he and three others (soon to become his ""Merry Men"") desert and pose as knights to get a quick ride home. Along the way, the hear of a plan by a man named Godfrey (Mark Strong), who plans to overthrow the new king, John (Oscar Isaac). Because of his adopted persona, Robin becomes the new hero that's supposed to rally the people against the traitor.There's nothing wrong with a dark and violent movie. Done well, they can pack a huge punch and be quite successful (""The Dark Knight"" being a prime example). However, ""Robin Hood"" is not among them for a number of reasons. First of all, there's no character development, and what there is, is borrowed from other films (Crowe's Robin Hood is just about the same person as Maximus from ""Gladiator,"" and Maid Marian is strikingly similar to Blanchett's star-making role in ""Elizabeth"").The film isn't a complete bust (it lasts far too long, however). There are some nice performances, including relative newcomer Oscar Isaac as Prince/King John, and especially Max von Sydow (who, if this film gets one of the 10 best picture nods at the Oscars next year, may get a Best Supporting Actor nod). And it's not every day that you see an actress of Cate Blanchett's stature and reputation doing a little sword fighting.Once again, the MPAA has barely skirted controversy. This isn't a wall-to-wall action movie. The violence is limited to avoid an R rating, which is understandable, because what is there is entirely worthy of an R rating. Some of it is pretty graphic.Okay, that's it. I've had it. The MPAA is so screwed up that I'm going to start giving my own ratings for movies if they are incorrect or misleading. The MPAA is so backward that they've become completely worthless. So I'm going to go back through all of my reviews and give them their own rating.My rating: Rated R for some graphic violence and intense battle scenes.",Robin Hood

I'm glad I got it from Netflix and didn't pay big money to sit through it in the theaters. I know what they were trying to do but the writing (which is the problem with most of the films made in Hollywood in the last ten several years) was just atrocious. I think sometimes writers don't read the stuff they write and see that it flows and makes sense. I can understand going for realism about the people and how they must have lived but for got sakes they really could have made poor Kate look less like a servant hag and more like a noble Lady.",Robin Hood
104,t_atzmueller,"""I am Robin Longstride. And I'll have my vengeance"", etc.",3,27 January 2014,"To discuss ""Robin Hood"" as a movie would be pointless. Newspaper-hacks compose 20 line reviews; give it a B- on account of the ticket sales and pass on to the next summer-flick. But I tend to see Robin Hood more as a symptom than a film: a symptom for lazy, hackneyed film-making. A symptom for an apathetic, uncaring audience; a symptom for a fat, lazy and essentially burned-out industry, that's hiding its cracks and wrinkles behind lots of make-up and CGI.Who is this film catering to? Certainly it's neither for fans of the Robin Hood lore, nor people who expect an accurate historic epic, short, those who generally tend to (at the latest by now) refuse to go see this type of blockbusters altogether.But those people are the minority. The majority doesn't think much about shelving out their seven Dollars for remakes like ""Clash of the Titans"", ""A Nightmare on Elmstreet"" or ""Robin Hood"". Generalizing, this audience tends to call their favorite film of all times the film which they saw in cinema last weekend, while probably already having forgotten which film they saw the week before that. ""Robin Hood"" is the cinematic equivalent of your average McDonald's product: The cheeseburger you're eating right now doesn't taste one iota different from the one you had in the past; or will the ones you'll eat in the future.And as I browse through my own, rather extensive DVD-library, I ask myself: Who's next?"" The ranks of classics that didn't get a more-or-less miserable remake are getting thinner. Looming their ugly heads on the horizon are remakes like 'Escape from New York', 'Logans Run' or 'Barbarella' – nothing official of course, but I'd put my money that it will happen eventually. Why bother coming up with something fresh if the audience don't seem to care anyhow? And even if ""Robin Hood"" (technically being a prequel) would have been the first adaptation of the matter ever – one could summarize it with one word: ""Yawn"".3/10",Robin Hood
105,diane-34,Says more about royalty than Robin Hood,10,14 June 2010,"I did something unusual today and actually watched, and even stranger, liked a Hollywood movie. Actually it had two Australian stars and a British director but it was a classic kill and pillage movie so loved by the genius movie makers of America (the worst part of the movie was watching the moronic previews of movies I now know to avoid at all cost).Scott is not my favourite director but when he is matched with actors of the quality of Crowe, von Sydow and Blanchett the movie is going to be memorable and this version of the oft told tale is no exception. I was reminded of the opening scene of The Gladiator where the Roman army had set up around Celtic positions and the area was muddy and the men where muddy and it was an extremely unappealing place from which, for any attackers, to draw there last breath. This Robin Hood started the same way, with an attack on a French castle after The Lion Heart returned from the Crusades (as you would do in those days to feed and pay your men).This is a male movie but if any person likes these three great actors it is well worth the effort to attend. Crowe's Robin Hood smoulders along delivering his lines and action with grace and great believability while Blanchett infuses her role with strength and again, great believability. The viewer will enjoy the 12th century politics with a singular supporting cast. Just do not expect a typical Hollywood product out of Disney Studios because you will be sorely disappointed by the realism with which Ridley Scott imbues this film about Robin Hood.",Robin Hood
106,chaswe-28402,"Better than Braveheart, worse than The Outlaw",3,1 September 2020,"Was this a joke ? Crowe and Ridley playing Monty Python ? The feeble French invasion turned to D Day in reverse. Same landing craft, however. The English arrows over the grey cliffs of Dungeness (cliffs? Dungeness is as flat as a pancake) didn't help the French to fight in the shade. Didn't King John actually sign Magna Carta at Runnymede ? But here it looked like he set it alight. Wasn't Marion a maid, not a missus ? I thought Robin robbed the rich to help the poor. Not here. So Richard didn't make it back to England to say hello to Errol ? Sorry Ridley. You've got it all wrong. The real Robin Hood always rode through the green and pleasant woodland, dressed in Lincoln Green, with his merry men, shooting deer and sheriffs, splitting arrows, fluently trouncing dastards, feared by the bad, loved by the good. Scouting ahead was nobody's fool, the well-employed Jester, with the brew that is true; and by his side was the glorious Maid Marion de Havilland, in brilliant sun-drenched colour. Wikipedia reveals this production to have been a stonking disaster, end to end. I didn't actually see the French king surrendering to Crowe, like somebody said, but there you go. How come von Sydow got a Beowulf-type Viking send-off ? Some good visuals, but not one of Ridley's best. I'd say his worst.",Robin Hood
107,pfgpowell-1,"Don't get het up about historical inaccuracies, just enjoy an entertaining film. Factual, it ain't",6,18 March 2016,"I'm rather puzzled why Ridley Scott's Robin Hood has attracted so much enmity, I really am. Just check out other reviews, and apart from the odd complimentary one, most are agin it. And that's odd.Yes, historically the film is in many ways cobblers: Richard the Lionheart, a scion of the Plantagenets and Angevins, didn't speak a word of English, didn't consider himself in the slightest bit English and, in total, spent very little time in England in his 43 years. Furthermore, he didn't even consider the kingdom of England his prime fiefdom and was more concerned with his possessions in what became France. His brother John who inherited the crown (Richard, although married, was reputedly gay and had no offspring except for, possibly, an illegitimate son) was most certainly a wastrel who eventually lost all the possessions in France and generally upset all his barons. The nicest thing historians have to say about him was that he was utterly incompetent.There's no evidence whatsoever that France landed 200 soldiers in the South Coast or that the king of France (or what remained of 'France' once you take away all the bits which belonged to Richard) ever considered invading England. For one thing, it would have made far more sense to do what the French eventually did do: take the French possessions from John.Then there's Hollywood England compared with English England: there is something faintly ridiculous about how utterly rural - and almost totally fake - the country seems in Scott's film. Granted many details, not least the mud and rough conditions of even a manor house, are good, but . . .But what is Scott doing? Well, he's most certainly not trying to give a history lesson. He's providing a 'prequel' to the story of Robin Hood, explaining how he might have become the figure of legend. And Robin Hood is pretty much a fictional character anyway, so Scott can more or less do what he likes. And what he does do isn't just not bad, it's very entertaining. And, dear friends, it's also intended as entertainment. Please remember that, and entertaining it is, too.So ignore the crabby naysayers and settle in for a romp done better than many another director might have achieved. Facts? This is fiction, and none the worse for that.",Robin Hood

109,socrates99,This remains an almost impossible movie to make,7,29 May 2010,"When I heard they were going to do another Robin Hood movie my first thought was, Who could be crazy enough to try? Ridley Scott, one of my favorite directors, was not my first guess. The result? It's not a waste of time, but it fails in some really important ways.The core problem, aside from imagining the period in detail, was always the depiction of historical England as being led by villains on occasion. The UK may have been the real birthplace of propaganda. They don't take their history lightly, or without heavy editing. And, for a couple of moments, I was enthralled to see the story go relatively dark. But ultimately it reverts to the old familiar story lines, and that just doesn't cut it anymore.Still I enjoyed what time Cate Blanchett and Max Von Sydow have on screen, and there are some scenes that deserve high praise for their ability to convince you that this may have been what things looked like back then. This is no small achievement as I understand there just isn't enough information out there to reconstruct a village or battle scene in this detail. My own imagination was set afire by what is on screen to the point that I couldn't help thinking more deeply about the period. But in the end the movie itself bogs down as it seems Ridley was not against resurrecting some of the more romantic folklore, which then sticks out as not really worth resurrecting.I continue to think, no one will ever succeed in making this storyline seem rooted in reality though I understand there's a documentary I haven't seen playing on cable about the origins of the real Robin Hood. There's just too much unknown or edited out from the historical record.",Robin Hood

111,Pro Jury,"Above MASTER & COMMANDER, below GLADIATOR",9,21 May 2010,"ROBIN HOOD has one wonderful thing going for it -- it is an epic summer action movie void of cartoon monsters and unreal computer effects. Poised to jump passed a ""9"" score to a ""10"" -- but only for an unremarkable music score.When ROBIN HOOD was over I walked out of the cinema humming the battle theme from GLADIATOR. Maybe this time Ridley skimped a bit too much on the composer department??? No sweeping greatness, breadth and complexity of the GLAIATOR score. No popular melody as in THE MASK OF ZORRO.MASTER & COMMANDER was an OK children's movie with, of all things, a Star Trek: The Next Generation feel.GLADIATOR was a movie masterpiece for grown up adults.ROBIN HOOD is someplace in between the two above films. A great family film aimed at junior high kids, but not a masterpiece. As ROBIN HOOD goes along, it offers more family appeal and walks away from GLADIATOR adultness. Yes, a family action film can be a perfect ""10"" masterpiece. But sadly, most people going to see this specific Robin Hood movie are expecting more to see a GLADIATOR than to see a DANTE'S PEAK.One of the most interesting things about watching ROBIN HOOD was seeing an almost easy going, almost jovial Russell Crowe. Even in the light hearted hockey movie MYSTERY ALASKA he was consistently more intense. Perhaps real life parenthood has given Russell greater acting range.In my cinema, the sound was not matched perfectly to the picture -- a slight delay. And, each arrow was louder than a thirty ought six. ROBIN HOOD receives a ""9"" harmed only by viewer expectations and a bland music score.",Robin Hood
112,rooee,Not very merry,4,15 May 2010,"Through a combination of endless film versions, the legend, the trailer, and the knowledge that Ridley Scott's lavish treatment of Nottingham's greatest communist is a prequel, you'll pretty much know the story. What the trailer doesn't bring across is the succession of ludicrous plot twists and unconvincing character motivations that fill the film's portly 140 minutes. Cutting a (very) long story short, the former problem sees Brian Helgeland's hero effectively single-handedly convincing England why democracy is such an awesome idea. As for those pesky character motivations – well, apart from Walter Loxley's (Max von Sydow) bonkers response to his son's death, and Prince John's bipolar last-minute about-face, Robin himself is an ungraspable hero (not to mention unplaceable, with that amorphous accent). By the time we 'meet' Robin's father, and learn of his fate, how much do we care? Cate Blanchett's Marian (a widow, not a maid) provides a spunky presence for the most part, although, like Return of the King's Eowyn, her character is undercut in the depressingly familiar final reel by being given little to do when the final scrap ensues.As an advert for the British countryside, this is a stunning achievement. But as a story, it would surely be preferable to see the forgotten, revisionist 'Nottingham' script filmed; or at the very least, for Mr Scott – still a world-class film-maker, and no mistake – to shrug off the spectres of his own historical epics: ditch the grit, the blue lenses, the reconstituted history, and thirty minutes of film, and deliver against the grain of his expectations.",Robin Hood

And whether thief or hero, one man from humble beginnings will become an eternal symbol of freedom for his people.Robin Hood chronicles the life of an expert archer, previously interested only in self-preservation, from his service in King Richard's army against the French. Upon Richard's death, Robin travels to Nottingham, a town suffering from the corruption of a despotic sheriff and crippling taxation, where he falls for the spirited widow Lady Marion (Cate Blanchett), a woman skeptical of the identity and motivations of this crusader from the forest. Hoping to earn the hand of Maid Marion and salvage the village, Robin assembles a gang whose lethal mercenary skills are matched only by its appetite for life. Together, they begin preying on the indulgent upper class to correct injustices under the sheriff.With their country weakened from decades of war, embattled from the ineffective rule of the new king and vulnerable to insurgencies from within and threats from afar, Robin and his men heed a call to ever greater adventure.

115,dvc5159,Robin Hood as you've never seen him before.,5,12 May 2010,"Like many great actor-director collaborations, Ridley Scott and Russell Crow once again deliver an action-packed adventure that is filled with lush scenery, epic battle sequences and strong characters wrapped neatly around quite the believable and solid origin story.What we have here, folks, is not the fabled and oh-so-beloved tale of Robin Hood defeating the evil Sheriff of Nottingham and rescuing Maid Marian from his evil clutches. Like some reviewers before me, forget everything you know about Robin Hood. This is a completely different version of the man, and it may very well be the most logical and closest representation of Robin Hood yet, with new characters we've rarely-to- never heard of and different events taking place instead of those commonly believed. No Moor sidekick or witch to be found. Kudos to Brian Helgeland for penning such a bold and unique take on the hero while keeping the original spirit (Robin's ""merry men"" and Friar Tuck are hilarious).Once again, Russell Crowe delivers a strong performance as the protagonist, righteous and heroic, but also a flawed man haunted by his past. Cate Blanchett is quite good and a bit spunky in her role as Marian. Both she and Crowe have good chemistry in the film. Mark Strong also proves himself to be Hollywood's go-to guy for villains for his devilishly menacing performance. If it were any more menacing he would wear a cowl. William Hurt, Mark Addy, Kevin Durand, Oscar Isaac and Max Von Sydow round up the fine supporting cast.And again, Ridley Scott is a masterful director. Even at the age of 72 he still manages to deliver the goods with his focused and gripping direction. ""Gladiator"" this isn't, but its spirit is present in the awesome, adrenaline-pumping action/battle sequences. Of course, the camera tends to get too shaky a little but that's a minor flaw.The cinematography is sweeping and gorgeous, accompanied by a memorable score by Marc Streitenfeld. Production and costume design are top notch - the royal family's castles are grand in design, instead of showing the poor living in grand fashion as in the past Robin Hood movies, here the poor's living condition are starkly realistic - complete with dirt and grit. And I would also like to point out that for about 98% of the whole movie, CGI was absent, meaning real extras, real fire, real horses, real buildings; it's just plain real. Absolutely refreshing; Cecil B. DeMille would be proud if he can see the number of extras employed for this film.In short, this take on the classic hero is a near-perfect summer blockbuster. It has action, adventure, comedy, romance, and drama all packed neatly into one spectacular ride. See it in the cinema because watching it later on the small screen would be a grave injustice.Kevin Costner, eat your heart out.Overall value: 7/10",Robin Hood
116,gary-444,Bold But Flawed,6,15 May 2010,"The title alone is pretty much all that connects this incarnation of Robin Hood with it's predecessors. A prequel, it could be described as the longest opening credits sequence in history, as it ends pretty much where the conventional story starts. This in itself is not a problem, yet despite much which is commendable ,somehow the end result fails to convince. With Ridley Scott in the Director's Chair, and Russell Crowe leading the line, quality is not in short supply, but this is no ""Gladiator"".It opens in France with Richard the Lion Heart besieging a castle and starts well. The action is terrific and Robin is introduced as a humble archer. Scott and Crowe are on firm territory. But once Richard is killed, and Robin assumes a Knight's identity the story starts to lose focus. Strangely, villain and traitor Sir Godfrey, assuredly played by mark Strong, gets back to London comfortably before Robin, Eurostar perhaps? We then have a strong dose of Court Intrigue as King John assumes power and Sir Godfrey plots a French coup. However, although well acted, the epic sweep which I suspect Scott was aiming for fails to convince.Up in Nottingham , Cate Blanchette is a feisty, if somewhat awkward Maid Marion. 41 in real life, when we first see her ,she appears to be more plausibly the wife of Sir Walter Loxley, rather than his son. And although she is a reasonable match for Crowe, the absence of a traditional youthful Marion lowers the glamour quotient considerably. Friar Tuck, Will Scarlett, the Sheriff of Nottingham and Little John all appear in very minor roles only, which is a pity, as the story would benefit from some more light and shade.The final act is rushed. Robin suddenly changes from unknown knight to a leader of Northern Earls and Barons in a scene which pretty much parodies Mel Gibson's ""Braveheart"" speech. They then appear to make a 250 mile dash, unsupported, to rout a French invasion, just as they are landing, in scenes which appear to parody the D- Day landings in ""Saving Private Ryan"". Bizarrely the English troops are augmented by half naked Nottinghamshire forest children and maid Marion in full face visor to avenge the death of both her father and first husband.All this is not to say that the film is without merit. The cinematography is superb and the creation of a new back story for Robin is no bad idea, complete with regret for a Christian massacre of Muslims. But ultimately the characters lack warmth and Scott tries too much in the 2hr 20 minute running time. Half that time neither does justice to Robin or King John.",Robin Hood
117,barrys82,Ridley's Robin Hood is worthy enough,7,28 July 2010,"Robin Hood latest movie by director Ridley Scott with Russell Crowe as Robin Hood. The movie focuses first on the battle of Robin to help the villagers that are being exploit by the king, and then on a ferocious war against the Spanish army. The movie is full of action, adventure, romance and maybe a little bit of humor. The rhythm is quite slow situation that makes the movie boring or tiresome at some moments besides that it is more than 2 hours long. The battle sequences are excellent there's not a single flaw in any of them. Ridley Scott manages the story to the perfection, he really knows how catch the viewer. The cast is very good. Russell Crowe delivers a good Robin Hood performance, although it sometimes reminds me his Gladiator role, Cate Blanchett is good as Lady Marion, William Hurt, Mark Strong, Max Von Sydow, Dany Huston and Mark Ady give a good support with their secondary roles.

That's what I wanted to do to the screen when I saw Robin Hood, an excessively boring and lamely made attempt to screw around with the classic tale of Robin Hood. Crowe is either screaming or sleeping throughout the film. I have never had this complaint about an action film before, but I would like less action. Although they over modernize this version, at least there's no dance breaking Johnny Depp like in Alice In Wonderland. The film finds its right tone 1 or 2 times for not more than a couple of seconds. The pacing is poor, and the running time too long, and it feels like they try to fit about 10 different movies into a ridiculous running time of 2 and 1/2 hours. I respect what they try to do with the steal from the rich to give to the poor thing and twist it around, but it feels too much like just another Ridley Scott action film, except more dull than usual. A great supporting cast like Mark Addy, Mark Strong, Cate Blanchett & Max Von Sydow are wasted, reading their lines in an either dull or laughable or dull and laughable way. Overall, you can definitely skip this Robin Hood because it's just here to steal from your wallet and give to the movie theater.",Robin Hood
119,bluesman-20,Rise and Rise again until Lambs became like Lions.,10,4 November 2010,Robin Hood is not the true story of Robin Hood and I doubt if we'll ever find that out. But in the meantime Ridley Scott and Russell Crowe give us a Robin Hood that is breath taking and tragic. It starts off with Robin and his men in France with King Richard The Crusades are over and done with and Richard failed. He wants to return home with his pockets full so he's resorting to plundering. At one point he meets Robin and Little John and asks Robin his opinion and the truth lands him in the stocks.the next day Richard is killed and robin and his men leave. The King's man Sir Robert of Locksley is taking the crown back home when he is ambushed Robin and his men arrive and save the crown but not Sir Robert he asks Robin to take his sword home to his father and to tell him he loves his father. Robin poses as Sir Robert to get aboard a ship and takes the crown and sword home. once home Robin sees the effects of the Crusades poverty is everywhere and The New King is power hungry and unleashing a new tax. Robin and his men arrive at Sir Robert's home and meets his father and Robert's wife Marion. Walter Locksley knows Robin's name and offers to clear up a few mysteries Robin has about his past if he will stay on and pose as Sir Robert in order to keep the king's men at bay. Robin is taken with Marion and agrees and soon he helps out but the poverty is so much that Robin and his men strike out at night and on their own to help the poor they call themselves the men of the Hood given that they wear long cloaks with Hoods. It is also apparent that there is something deceitful going on the kings's men are collecting taxes and burning towns and turning the dukes and Barons against the king. A Civil War is brewing and France is invading the country. Robin helps unite the Feuding parties and arrives at the invasion point to drive off the invaders and for his reward he is branded a outlaw because he dared to embarrass the King in suggesting that he write a charter of rights that would ensure Justice for all men. THat's the story more or less. Russell Crowe Excels as Robin Hood he bring a jaded outlook to Robin that no one has done before Sean Connery did it in Robin and Marion but Crowe Makes it all the more believable because he's come home and faced with all this poverty and injustice and the way he handles it makes you believe that if this is the true story then Robin Hood was a tired cynical man who got fed up and challenged the system by fighting the crown. All the other films have a laughing high spirited fun loving Robin but this one feels right.

120,Meven_Stoffat,Did the above 3/10 reviewers even see this movie?!?!?!,3,15 May 2010,"I give this two out of three stars for the gorgeous visuals, and the other star for Oscar Isaac's performance. Both managed to save this movie from getting a 0/10.But today I went to go see the movie, especially after months of hype; it was directed by Ridley Scott and had Russell Crowe, and it was the long awaited Robin Hood. When I saw the ad with on the Superbowl, I got all hyped up and excited. It looked like it was going to be an awesome reimagining of an epic.Instead... we got basically a very derivative and boring movie about some emo dude named Robin Hood. That's basically about it.First off, WHERE IS ROBIN HOOD??? Robin Hood should be fun, adventurous, he's basically the James Bond of the 12th century. Prince of Thieves did a way better job at portraying the character. Instead we get a whiny and angsty emo guy named Robin Hood who grumbles his way through the movie.Second, there's way too much going on. There's at least 30 different story lines, like... well, the king dies, the new King John has been appointed the throne, Robin has managed to flee back to England, the French are planning an invasion, etc. Yawn. There's so much going that it's hard to keep track of what goes on.Also, the movie is very derivative. Let's see: Where did the landing on the beach towards the end as well as the battle come from? Oh that's right! Saving Private Ryan. Where did all those pre-battle ""speeches"" come from? Oh that's right! Braveheart. Where did the so-called Robin come from? Oh that's right! Gladiator! Huzzah for recycling!!! Cause after all, movies are environmentally friendly The action scenes were very poorly done. It seems like Scott went to the team: ""Oh yeah, so ya know. Shake the camera, splash water everywhere, throw some fake blood everywhere, have people jump around clanging their swords, and stuff like that."" ""Cool, nobody can see what's going on!"" Most importantly, the movie was just plain... too long. I have indeed seen longer movies but seriously, this is just long. At least 30 minutes should be trimmed. There are tons of scenes that don't have anything to do with the plot and even more importantly, too many subplots and characters, half of which could be cut, and the end, the movie is just forgettable to the point where you won't even remember how the movie opens.In short, this movie was an utter disaster on Scott's part, and was in general, frustrating to watch. I still can't get over how frustrating it was.",Robin Hood
121,mnpollio,Fairly pointless rendition of the legend,5,28 November 2018,"Robin Hood is one of the most oft-filmed cinematic subjects on record. So if one plans to do it again, the end results better be either a load of fun or have a new approach. This somber entry into the pantheon by director Ridley Scott is decidedly NOT a load of fun, but it definitely does have a new view. One that renders it fairly pointless, as I will discuss below.The story centers on Russell Crowe's Robin Longstride, who with his compatriots stumbles across the dying Robin of Locksley (the real ""Robin Hood"" of legend). In an act of charity, he agrees to return the man's sword to his father (Max Von Sydow). Once there, he gets roped into pretending to be Robin of Locksley to aid Von Sydow and the dead man's widow Cate Blanchett due to political and economic issues. In the background, there is a lot of murky political maneuvering with a confidante (Mark Strong) of the callow Prince John (Oscar Isaac) acting as a double agent and provocateur to foment a French invasion. The ultimate goal seems to be whether Crowe's Robin can rally the citizens and his men to defend England and Prince John against the invasion, when they really do not serve defending.While the production is solid, the screenplay is obtuse and often times needlessly dense. There are a ton of supporting characters and the film does a poor job of differentiating them. Robin's band are immensely forgettable and the casting director should have been replaced, because too many of the political players sound alike and resemble each other to such a degree that they blend together. Except for William Hurt who, for some unknown reason, is cast as a British politician, but who never attempts a British accent and seems to be wandering through the film in search of his paycheck.Crowe is solid, if a bit dull as Robin. He is also a bit long in tooth for the part. Strong trots out his trademark scowl, but little else. Isaac seems more bratty than menacing as Prince John. Best performances come courtesy of Von Sydow, who is both appealing and convincing (and should have been in a better film), and Blanchett, who balances Marian's restraint with some wry wit. The final battle is noisy and confusing.What makes the film pointless is that it gives us no reason why it should even be part of the Robin Hood canon as opposed to just being about new characters. It keeps some of the names, but very little about the legend itself. This counterfeit Robin never gets into robbing from the rich and giving to the poor - the whole point of the character. Matthew MacFadyen's Sheriff of Nottingham is barely a cameo part with nothing to do. In fact, the film ends before any of the elements of the legend even come in to play. It is akin to going to see a film about ""James Bond"" only to find out that it is not really about ""James Bond"", but about a plumber going about his life doing things that have nothing to do with ""James Bond"", and then at the end we get a blurb telling us that after the conclusion the man went on to become ""James Bond"". It may be true that this fake Robin went on to become the Robin Hood of legend, but Scott and company give us no evidence to believe this and fail to tell that story at all.",Robin Hood
122,CountJonnie,"Starts interesting, but ends as a ripoff",6,22 August 2019,"This 2010 version of Robin Hood starts interesting and almost immediately it's obvious that this movie is part prequel and part reimagining. This is refreshing and it puts a new spark in the characters that are known,.Unfortunately, after the first half, the movie goes down the drain. The character who are reintroduced as new, suddenly become 2-dimensional and no effort is wasted in fleshing the characters out further. The rest just gets sloppier. The story becomes rushed, the action becomes messy and everything feels less interesting. Almost as if the director and actors stopped caring. Even Cate Blanchett who singlehandedly was the best thing in this movie, just.....gave up.The movie started as a solid 7, but became a 6 and maybe that's generous.",Robin Hood
123,eshwarmail,A rare but a complete misfire by Ridley Scott,3,9 December 2012,"Ridley Scott is a director I have always admired for his ability to direct different genres effortlessly, has a vision for spectacular visuals and known to get the best out of his actors. He fails in all of above in this movie. I am an equally ardent admirer of Russell Crowe as an actor who looked uninterested, overweight and not in one scene fit the character of Robin Hood the legend we had all heard about.Firstly, it is a bummer that this movie is about how a nobody archer became a legend - since it is still a legend where there is no historical evidence whether such a character ever existed, the point that the writers concocted a story like this already feels artificial. The essence of Robin Hood is all about adventure, daredevilry and chivalry - where you see none of it. Just a morose soldier who puts himself in extraordinary circumstances and does stuff that you expect any hero character would do.Robin Longstride (Russell Crowe), Little John (Kevin Durand) and a few other soldiers deserts the English army after the death of King Richard the Lionheart (Danny Huston) during his French conquests in the Third Crusade. They chance upon an ambushed English convoy of Knights that are taking the King's crown back. Robin and his gang impersonate the Knights for a ticket back home that is simmering with civil unrest due to heavy war taxes, looming drought and tyranny. Prince John (Oscar Isaac), next in line for English throne is betrayed by his trusted mercenary Godfrey (Mark Strong) who is a French double agent helping the enemy take advantage of this civil unrest. Robin's impersonation leads him to a small unknown town of Nottingham where he is obliged to carry forward his act as the Oxley heir and husband of Marion (Cate Blanchett) which becomes the center of unrest.There is not one special moment in this lengthy monotonous war epic that you have not seen before from an abundant collection of movies featuring this era. The first 30 minutes features a highly disconnected screenplay with questionable acting for a Ridley Scott's movie and the battle sequences though ambitiously produced were generic with not one scene producing a moment of awe. Though Cate Blanchett has more than required screen time, she hardly makes a case for it. The overall runtime does not help as well. The most entertaining and innovative stuff is reserved for ending credits with brilliant animation and exciting music.A rare but a complete misfire by Ridley Scott.",Robin Hood
124,Ryan_MYeah,Not quite Ridley Scott's finest film.,6,29 May 2010,"The film stars Russell Crowe as the infamous thief who stole from the rich, and gave to the poor. Robin has just come back to England after fighting in King Richard's war against the French. He journeys to Nottingham, and poses as the husband of Lady Marion (Played by Cate Blanchett), so that she may keep the property of her real husband who died in the war, part of a favor to her husband's father (Played by Max Von Sydow). Meanwhile, the newly appointed King John (Played by Oscar Isaac) is greedily taxing the land of all of it's funds, unaware that one of his closest subjects, Sir Godfrey (Played by Mark Strong) is secretly collaborating with the French on a massive invasion.So, this shot, kind of missed the target. But you know what, even though it was off center from hitting the bullseye, as an action/adventure film, it's not bad.This is all intended to be a prequel, and set up to the Robin Hood legend that WE all know. The gleeful prince of thieves ranging from The Adventures of Robin Hood from 1938, all the way into animation, such as Disney's animated retelling of the story. Well, that was the past. Even though they still retain some of it, Robin and his band of Merry Men have been deprived of some of the personality traits normally associated with them. But I can't really blame Ridley Scott for wanting to present this kind of version of Robin Hood, in fact I do applaud him a bit for it.Performances were fine. Russell Crowe and Cate Blanchett, both incredibly talented actors, are good in their roles as Robin Hood and Lady Marion respectively. But, I don't know, they didn't show much chemistry. Oscar Isaac is a real attention grabber, not really in a good way though, it just seems like he tries way too hard. William Hurt, and Max Von Sydow, great. Robin's Merry men, are kind of average to good (Special mention to Mark Addy). And now to finish off performances... WHAT THE HELL is with Mark Strong getting typecast as villains (not to mention getting cast in number 963 on the list of villains who are bald and/or scarred)? Can't he play a nice guy for a change, or something like Body of Lies? Looks evil, but isn't all that evil. Still, I can't deny that he does a good job at it.Now the action in the movie is great, even though I prefer Pietro Scalia's work in Kick-Ass, his work here with the battle scenes are great. There are some good scenes throughout this movie with good pacing, then there's other scenes which are draggy. It's a bit unbelievable how boring some scenes are, often bordering on a history lesson.Overall thoughts: The film benefits from good performances, and epic battle sequences, but suffers from a sometimes off screenplay, and uneven pacing.So that's **1/2 out of **** for Robin Hood.",Robin Hood
125,greene515,The Definitive version of Robin Hood,10,19 May 2010,"Ridley Scott's Robin Hood is a very welcome take on the old legend, Russell Crowe is tailor made for the part. 'Robin Hood' is a great collaboration between film director and star which now marks the third time 'Gladiator' Body of Lies' the two talents work. This new take on the familiar legend is refreshing it's as you can expect from Sir Ridley Scott beautifully shot. there's a few surprises to be had in this version we have Willaim Hurt, Eillen Atkins who was cast after Vannessa Redgrave was unable to follow through due to the tragic death of her daughter, and the legendary Max Von Sydow and not Christopher Plummer as some dolts in the cinema audience thought it was! one hopes that their maybe more films about the central character but Sir Ridley Scott has never made any sequels to any of his previous efforts one may only hope that he may continue to do so. on the other hand as the inevitable DVD & Blu-Ray's will be released one can expect to have an extended cut of this film after all i feel there should be much more to some of the scenes Cate & Russells love scenes perhaps? or Simon McBurney's extended demise after all we were only offered a glimpse of that in a montage. and perhaps more scenes with the villainous Mark Strong, All in all Robin Hood is a great film proof that 'they still make them like they used to.",Robin Hood

That happened with many movies before, like ""Snow White and the Huntsman"" for example. I liked the movie, it was well written, altho I feel like some things were missplaced and wrong. For example, you can't let kids go into war against professional knights of France, not alone make them the winning side. Also taking note of the 200+ million dollar budget, the movie should have done more that it did, but all in all, it is a solid movie with a decent runtime that doesn't get boring for a single second.",Robin Hood
127,badajoz-1,Typical Ridley Scott - good images but plot and rest derivative!,4,12 May 2010,"Ridley and Tony Scott and I grew up watching the same sort of dual feature movie down the local flea pit - only his was in Hartlepool and mine was in Cardiff. There was a genre that was set in medieval or Arthurian England where a secondary leading US actor like Robert Taylor or Alan Ladd came across to Britain to lead up a cast of local thesps like Robert Morley or Guy Rolfe or Michael Rennie, which were fairly successful - the best by far being 'Ivanhoe' which had a gorgeous young Elizabeth Taylor being burnt at the stake! This 'Robin Hood' is an expensive remake. The reason, I say that, is that they always had some plot about the lead role finding out his father was some great liberal lord or peasant who fell out with the establishment! Unfortunately this film is top heavy with superfluous plot, and the real identity of Robin Longstride (Russell Crowe) takes ages to come to fruition. Yes, Robin's father wrote the document before Magna Carta, being a sort of illiterate medieval version of Tom Paine and Thomas Jefferson - really!? The plot becomes so convoluted that Mark Strong is some sort of Benedict Arnold figure (got to make it comprehensible to US audiences), King John is a mad spoilt brat, and Marian a sword wielding warrior queen aka Xena (cue the joke when you first see her bending a long bow - a feat few men could achieve!), while the totally wasted Sheriff of Nottingham (Matthew McFadyean) takes the humorous relief award with the best line about his mother! A historical mish mash then with stock characters and plots from every source imaginable (plus plenty of slomo), eg the opening looks like a colour remake of 'Lord of the Flies!' and pre-final battle looks like Wendy leading the Lost Boys into action! The acting is okay, but mostly one note. The script soon to be seen in court with Steven Spielberg suing for plagiarism - would you believe that the French invaders come ashore in WW2 landing craft with scenes of dead bodies, arrows whizzing and blood shot underwater!? Knowing where the final battle was shot at Freshwater Bay, I shall be going to look soon for those CGI cliffs! And, by the end, if you are wondering how Robin becomes an outlaw, then don't blink, it all happens ludicrously in about 120 seconds flat! Four for brio and cheek and lots of action, but what a load of old blarney, sorry, horse manure!",Robin Hood
128,Jerique,"Not legendary great, not atrociously awful...",8,31 May 2010,"I'm not a huge fan of Ridley Scott nor of Russell Crowe, but he was entertaining in A Beautiful Mind and mesmerizing in Gladiator. Robin Hood is somewhat layered and told in the same dynamic as Gladiator and it's not really surprising since they both were helmed by Scott and anchored by Crowe.I felt that the movie drags on at times and got a vibe of too many endings or I felt that a few of the fade outs would amount to rolling credits. It was quite predictable but really...shouldn't it be? In the first viewing of the story, I enjoyed it. I've never seen any other version of Robin Hood before and this one was great.I was surprised at many points of the story and felt it was really captivating by some means. I enjoyed the love story as it unfolded. I really like the way Cate portrayed her character and the dialogue between Marion and Robin. Their chemistry was undeniably sound.I was impressed by the sword fights and I was impressed by the special effects and the costumes. It wasn't incredibly great and not at all close to being the best film of the year, but it's not terrible in the least and will make a good profit at the box office. I'd recommend it to anyone even considering it or was wondering what's worth to see.",Robin Hood
129,galahad58-1,Pure Fantasy With Not Once Ounce Of Historical Fact,6,15 May 2010,"I really wish that I was writing a summary with a better outcome, but alas Robin Hood was a very mediocre film--at best. When one decides to make a picture about the past, they should at least familiarize themselves with the era to get some aspects correct about that time frame. While it is fantasy and a movie, it is nice to have some reality to the project. Saving Private Ryan and Titanic were historical fiction---they had fictitious characters in real situations and that appealed to audiences. Braveheart took a real character and added some Hollywood elements, but it kept the spirit of the character alive and thus made a nice film. Gladiator and Robin Hood did not bother to find anything remotely real about the time frame and made nothing spectacular.Ridley Scott is so overrated. Scott's best days were his eye when he made Alien and Blade Runner---every film since then has been average to below average. Scott's best work was in his early years and it was in Science Fiction.Russell Crowe just plays Russell Crowe. Cinderella Man was the one film where he dominated the screen and took the script to heart, but every other film he is just the same--himself---a violent, arrogant, self important person.Robin Hood fails on many levels: -an arrow in those times was made with real feathers and could not fly when wet, yet Robin shoots a wet arrow through someone's neck who is hundreds of yards away -Robin is an archer. In those times the English archer was one of the most feared weapons and why England had so much power, but archers were not skilled swordsmen. So when Robin is charging the mounted knights it is absurd. Robin would have been on the ridge shooting his bow. Skilled knights and soldiers would have chopped him to bits in hand to hand combat.-Royalty never ever ever were in the fields plowing the land. Thus Marion in the fields with a tan would be an outrage--since royalty covered themselves to maintain a white complexion. Tan complexions meant low born.-There would be no way Marian would be able to lift a sword in battle. Swords were heavy and she would never have been able to go toe-to-toe with soldiers.-It is impossible for Marian to be donning armor and riding into battle. She would not have had the strength to support the armor, yet alone move with all the weight.Aside from all the Hollywood fantasies, the script was weak as can be--the acting was (Yawn) mediocre and the film was completely uninspiring.It is sad that I would have to say that Robin Hood: Prince of Thieves had a better story, a better feel, and better performances. Alan Rickman was a marvel in Prince of Thieves and even Kevin Costner was a better Robin Hood than Russell Crowe---and that is sad.",Robin Hood
130,Catharina_Sweden,"It is good, but it is not ""Robin Hood""",4,2 December 2010,"I do not like it, when they do this. That is: take the name of a famous character, and then make a movie that does not follow the original story at all. Or, as this picture is supposed to show Robin Hood's life _before_ he became the outlaw - that pictures events that no one knows anything about. (Providing that Robin Hood has existed at all, of course.) Just to make money out of the name.But if you forget that the movie is supposed to be about Robin Hood, it is really quite good. They have got the period exactly right, with lots of correct period pieces and the right atmosphere of the times.It is not a romantic movie though, as the traditional movies about Robin Hood - for example the most famous one with Errol Flynn. It is much more realistic.Also, I cannot understand this hype about Russel Crowe. I do not think he is handsome at all. He looks like Mr Average Jones, at least to me... And the woman playing Maid Marion is entirely wrong for the part, as is the part in itself. She is too old, too haggard and too hard. Maid Marion should be young and fair, innocent and well brought-up.",Robin Hood
131,Chalice_Of_Evil,"Robin Hood, Robin Hood, riding through the glen...",7,12 May 2010,"Acting: Without Russell Crowe and Cate Blanchett, I'd have probably deemed this film 'average'. It's their acting which brings the film up a level and keeps your attention when things slow down. Crowe certainly proves up to the role of Robin, making him serious enough but not so much that you become sick of him. He does have a lighter side to him, which is good. Blanchett, meanwhile, is excellent as Marion. She's strong, confident and can handle herself (though not in the lame sort of ""wannabe tough woman"" way). At the same time, she's elegant and smart, but not so serious that you find her unlikeable. The interaction between Robin and Marion is, in large part, what holds this film together. Both actors work extremely well with each other and I loved all the scenes that they shared. They both even managed to provide a couple of humorous moments.The three actors playing Robin's main band of Merry Men (Will Scarlet, Allan A'Dayle and Little John) are all good. Their characters are likable and have a good relationship with Robin. They also provide some humour, but never become ""silly"". Robin's interaction with his men was the other dynamic I really liked in the movie.As for the villains, Prince John is played by Oscar Isaac - who is a little bit over-the-top in his portrayal of the character. He tends to yell/over-react to things when it's really not needed, which kind of makes him come across as a petulant child (though if that's how the character is supposed to be played, then the actor did a fine job). His French Princess, Isabella (played by Léa Seydoux) is far more tolerable. Then there's Godfrey, played by Mark Strong (who has seemingly become the go-to guy for villains in recent films). While I found him more effective here than previous movies I'd seen him in, I still didn't find him to be overly great. He was evil enough, but didn't really leave much of a lasting impression (unlike an arrow to his face - which *did* leave a lasting impression. Speaking of Ol' Scar Face, he apparently finds arrows to the neck amusing for some reason, as you'll see near the end). The Sheriff of Nottingham (Matthew MacFadyen) isn't the 'main bad guy' in this film, as he's been portrayed in other films. He's more just a nuisance this time around.William Hurt is quite good as William Marshal and Max von Sydow is very good as Sir Walter Loxley. The relationship he develops with Robin makes for some nice moments on screen.Direction: As you'd expect from the director of Gladitor, the film is masterfully shot. Ridley Scott knows how to film things to their fullest potential. The scenery is very nice to look at, the atmosphere/mood adds a lot to the film and the action sequences are quite well-done also. Without his direction, the film would have been a snooze-fest, but he keeps things pretty lively.Writing: The script, I feel, is possibly the weakest part of the film. The story starts off rather slow and doesn't get interesting, in my personal opinion, until Robin meets Marion. Things thankfully don't get *too* confusing throughout, but if you do happen to miss something, you might get a bit lost. There's a few twists and turns, and perhaps a few too many cutaways to other things just when you're getting into watching a certain scene.Music: I enjoyed the score for the film, especially the (what I imagine to be) Robin Hood 'theme', which is played numerous times throughout. Whatever you do, make sure you stay to watch the end credits - they were visually stunning and really well-conceived, I thought. Quite memorable.To sum up, I think this will be regarded as one of the 'better' interpretations of Robin Hood, but perhaps not the ""definitive"" version. It achieves what it sets out to do (ie. give us a new interpretation of the legend), and if you're after no more than that, then you should be satisfied. However, those expecting endless action may well be disappointed. There's quite a bit of talking, but there's also a sh!tload of arrow-shooting and much merry-making to be had.",Robin Hood
132,fung0,A truly legendary new swashbuckler,9,4 June 2010,"If you like a flavorful, intelligent - and frankly revisionist - swashbuckler, do yourself a favor: ignore the CGI-addled nay-sayers, and go see Robin Hood on the biggest screen available. This is some of Ridley Scott's finest work, and an absolutely glorious film by any standard.Regarding some of the bizarre criticisms...First: no, this is NOT the tired old Douglas Fairbanks / Errol Flynn tale, with Robin fighting Friar Tuck on a log bridge, and foolishly coming out of hiding for an archery contest. This is a revisionist prequel. Think of it as the mirror image of the brilliant Robin & Marian. As the latter takes older versions of these characters to some new places, Scott's Robin Hood presents an alternative history of their earlier days, before Robin became an outlaw.This is a GOOD thing, all the way. The story is fresh, and allows for some novel character development. Both Robin and Marian are people we haven't met before, but they're rich, immensely likable characters.Second: is the story filled with anachronisms? Not really. There are certainly a few minor bloopers, but is anyone really going to see this film expecting a historical drama?? Robin Hood is a character of legend, not history. This film makes the legend more vivid than ever before. It's surely more credible than previous Hollywood versions of Robin Hood, and compares rather favorably to such lauded yet laughably inaccurate epics as Scott's own Gladiator.Third: the pacing. This is NOT an all-out CGI-filled action extravaganza. Rather, it's more reminiscent of great character-driven swashbucklers like The Wind & the Lion, or The Four Feathers. Scott takes his time building up the larger-than-life characters, then lets the action follow from their personalities. No, it's not heavy drama... it's great around-the-fire storytelling. More Homer than Shakespeare, and more Jung than Freud.Finally: on a technical level, this film leaves absolutely nothing to be desired. Ridley Scott has long been one of the screen's most dynamic directors, and here he absolutely rises to the occasion. The pastoral England of this film has a grit to it that you can almost smell, and the action scenes offer detail and sweep to rival Lord of the Rings. Acting, also, is spot-on. Russell Crowe doesn't break new ground, perhaps, but he nicely refines the world-weary warrior we've previously seen in films like Gladiator, or Master & Commander. Cate Blanchett is impeccable as the mature, earthy and infinitely appealing Marian. And Max von Sydow is perfection as the elder Locksley, a quirky old guy you immediately feel you've known forever.In short, this is another one of those minor masterpieces that seems doomed by audiences' low expectations. How can a moronic film like Star Trek get 10 out of 10, and this clever, thoughtful, atmospheric Robin Hood average only a 7, with many people rating it down in 'bomb' territory?? The only answer I can think of is: too much romance (in both senses), not enough actual bombs. Too bad... this is a film I look forward to owning on Blu-ray, and savoring over many viewings.",Robin Hood
133,virindra,"Too much talking, so little action.",3,9 August 2011,"When I saw the names Ridley Scott and Russel Crowe I had to see this movie. It did not get a high rating on IMDb, so I waited to rent this one on DVD.I must say this movie had a lot of potential to become a good action movie, but it wasn't. The movie is shot like it has been made in the past, when Robin was still alive. I could live with that. Then there are these actors and actresses who are trying so hard to tell their lines in such an ancient English with that boring accent. I got the idea the film maker was too much focused on the dialogs, which were quite boring), and the way the people had to speak like the real people would have spoken in these days. Not very interesting.The clothing did not match of the clothing in those days.Robin Hood is wearing a jacket when he rides a horse with Marian (terrible wannabe Alleta Jacob actress). That jacket has the style of todays clothing, only the zipper is taken off.When Robin is on a boat, a man says to him it takes only 20 minutes to come to the shore. Nobody is wearing watches. So what difference would it make to arrive at 20 minutes or ""we are just there...""? Like I said, there is too much boring talking, long conversations, stupid songs, little action.",Robin Hood
134,galensaysyes,A distant dream,7,19 December 2010,"Last night I had a dream of the Middle Ages: I dreamed I was seeing Sharpe's Rifles in The Return of Martin Guerre. Only Sharpe appeared to be on a drunk, his Rifles couldn't be told apart, and sometimes the story changed to The Lion in Winter (and once to Peter Pan). Some of it was quite violent, but it was all rather beautiful.I wasn't asleep, of course; the dream was this film. It's like a medieval tapestry brought to life, but as in a tapestry, or a dream, the characters, so near and so huge, remain unknown, and although they go about their business with seeming urgency, yet their actions seem formal and ritualized, as if they were doing a May Day pantomime (one almost expects to see The Wicker Man).Contributing to the enigmatic effect is the leading actor, who gives the barest outline of a performance, in the barest outline of a part. So here again, as with Kevin Costner, you have a Robin Hood story without a Robin Hood. But his absence makes surprisingly little difference; Robin Hood is more of an idea than a character anyhow. And although the film ends where one would expect a Robin Hood story to start, at the point where Robin is declared an outlaw, it has enough of the requisite elements to be doing with, especially the forest of Barnsdale, with its green, misty depths: it has true storybook allure.",Robin Hood

I liked Russell Crowe as Robin Hood but like comments before i was mystified by so much So Robin Hood is so called because he is a 'man of the hood' and goes around the Sherwood Forest robbing people and 'hooded up' in order not to be recognised. So said his 'merry men' So when King Richard died and Robin 'acqured' his white horse, how come King John didn't want it when Robin got to meet him in London and how come Robin got liberty to continue to ride it forever thereafter The Loxley love story with Marion and Robin 'smacked' a little of Richard Gere in Sommersby and the French militia arriving to English shores to do battle reminded me 'in reverse' of the D-day landing by the English in France in 'Saving Private Ryan' Most intriguing that Robin is portrayed as an aristocrat who is made out to be an outlaw by king John while also being a mouthpiece for the Baron and influencing King John for the creation of the Magna Carta. Interesting that Ridley Scott seeks to overlap history with both monarchs Richard the Lion Heart and King John.I watched in an Indonesian cinema where half of the audience had probably heard of Robin Hood but had no idea of its legendary significance in British history.Like Alice in Wonderland, this is not for a younger audience or may I say for an audience who know little of British history but on the other hand its a good watch for the action alone, unlike Iron Man 2.",Robin Hood

From the breathtaking cinematography to it's strong sense of realism, everything in this film shines perfectly. I would actually say this was better than Gladiator, which Scott and Crowe also collaborated together on. The sheer scale and epic feel to the film drifted me to a different world entirely. I was there, i was witnessing the events as they happened. One word to describe this film is magic, because after this roller-coaster ride you ask yourself, how the hell did they do all of that? Well Ridley Scott is an absolute master and auteur director for all things epic and large scale. For it's 2 hour 30 minute length, some viewers may be put off, but let me tell you not one second is boring or wasted, everything is put to good use.

138,krzysiektom,Upside down,6,15 May 2010,"It is not all bad but nevertheless it is disappointing for me, coming from Ridley and all. Funny thing, after reading the reviews before seeing it, I expected something different. Most people praise the look of the film and the ""invigorating"" action scenes, but criticize Cate B. and the script. I agree only on one thing: the script was a letdown. For me Cate was about the best thing in the film... while the action scenes disappointed me bitterly. I also did not love the look of the film - mostly grays and a lot of it shot in close ups, as if to avoid wider shots, because all these villages etc. were artificial. I think the films like Braveheart or Monty Python's Holy Grail showed what medieval England was about much better. Even the TV series Robin Hood from the 1980s did better in this respect. Now to the fighting scenes: before seeing it I expected another wonder, like the fighting scenes in Kingdom of Heaven. But none of it to be had here, it is too messy, too edited, too much in close ups, and too safe, as if to bland the effect in order to appease mums and their little offspring. Even the final battle was poorly done for me, in a too chaotic manner. (Of course Marion had to appear and fight, what else is Ridley Scott if not insanely politically correct? And where was the normal army, hundreds of soldiers that real King John surely had? The script naivety is amazing and irritating here). Again Braveheart blows this one out of the water. Shocking, considering that the initial battle in Gladiator is a viewing orgasm and the bloody skirmish in the woods in KoH, when crusaders fight Bishop's men, is a true gem of directing, editing, photography and musical score. Ridley also handled superbly bigger fighting scenes in KoH, they all had almost a musical flow and elegance to them. Something went wrong with Robin Hood, maybe Ridley was simply tired, after all he is above 70 now? Now add to this an overly serious and bombastic script (Magna Carta of Rights and ""give us liberty"" speeches, yack)... Common Ridley, find yourself another scribe, one that doesn't take himself for a serious, ""deep"" writer. I think of the 5 films made by Scott with Crowe I like this one least.",Robin Hood

At this point, considering that Ridley Scott in the gladiator did a 7-years spanned chronological diversion from real history, and nobody had problems with that, I don't see what's wrong with him playing around with history here.First of all, King Richard lionheart might spoke french (English kings since 1066 came from Normandy), but that doesn't mean he didn't feel English. The battle at the beginning of the film really took place, and king Richard really died in that battle.Then, King John's character is nicely depicted here. Oscar Isaac did an impressive and underrated job to deliver him. And he did sign the Magna Charta around 15 years after the movie's setting (we're in years 1199-1200). This film is simply showing the idea that this charter might have been proposed earlier, IF all the other things happened. The conceptual idea of how was it signed by the king is not that mistaken. Surely they knew they're not doing a historically accurate film from that point of view. Again, Ridley Scott's the gladiator is not 100% accurate (but I assume is preferred by audiences because it's got gore).What I felt as being accurate was the whole setting. It really was historically accurate. All of the medieval houses, the London of 1199, the way people felt (except for the 'freedom to all' idea, and the night dance) and so many other things. Also to praise is... everything in the film. Including music and acting. The director's cut adds scenes which make some details of the story understand better, and that's not bad at all. I really wish this movie was better considered.",Robin Hood
142,blacklist-1,"Not a true epic that it could have been, but still very enjoyable nonetheless.",7,12 May 2010,"Ridley Scott brings another new version of Robin Hood to the table with previous series and films. This I found was meant to be a much darker version of Hood and a new take. I was really looking forward to this and thought it would be as truly epic like Scott's other film with Crowe's Gladiator, but it falls short somewhat. The difficulty in doing this I thought particularly with Russel Crowe playing Robin was the fact that the character is British and Crowe was American. He tried to pull off the British accent and he did at the start quite well, but shortly and for the remainder of the film, he just fell back to his Amercian one. It's only a small gripe but it does take away a small part of the authenticity of the myth of Robin Hood. Saying that Crowe's performance is good and he settles into the roles gracefully with composure. Cate Blanchett as Maid Marion was okay. She had a good inner fiestiness but I found her to be a bit cold to be honest. I envisioned her to have more warmth, but that's just my interpretation.The others actors in this film and I'm surprised to say that Crowe wasn't the best actor in this but I found Mark Strong's acting as Godfrey to be very good. He was a menacing villain, but the person who stole the show for me was the unknown actor who I haven't heard of as Oscar Issac who played King John. His acting was excellent and he perfectly portrayed the King John I've seen in previous versions. He has a great future ahead of him.As to far as the romantic element in the film between Robin and Marion. There is little chemistry between Blanchett and Crowe. However I can't blame Ridley Scott too much as he never has been a director with a strength for the romantic elements. The script and dialogue was decent enough for an action film with some good laughs of comedy, but the script felt a bit dry and rusty and could have had more wit and inventiveness.The biggest strength I would say for Scott is the action sequences, which were co-ordinated well with plenty of excitement though I did think the action climax was a bit abrupt. What he has done perfectly is capture the essence of the story surrounding Hood, as there is plenty of exploration surrounding the story and the scenery and costumes of 13th century England is encapsulated beautifully. Overall this isn't the true epic it should have been and I was slightly disappointed even though all parts of film departments performed well in terms of acting and action etc. It could have been bigger as I was expecting more. However I'm not going to put this down too much as this is a terrific achievement by Scott and is still a very entertaining film to watch that hasn't made the story of Robin Hood tiresome. The way it ends suggests the possibility of a sequel. I look forward to it if they're is one and I recommend going to see this on the big screen. Ridley Scott's vision of Robin is different and refreshing in a way and worthy of viewing.",Robin Hood
143,budmassey,The Best Robin Hood Ever!,9,15 May 2010,"If you were expecting a prissy nancy boy prancing around in chartreuse tights like some demented elf, dangling from vines like an over stimulated chimpanzee, and spouting supercilious aphorisms like a drunken stand up comic, this is not your movie. Ridley Scott has re-imagined Robin Hood as, of all things, an action hero. Actually, it seems that whenever Ridley Scott thinks of an action hero, he thinks of his Oscar® winning muse, Russell Crowe, and, as director-actor pairings go, that's a good thing.It is ironic that Crowe, the oldest actor ever to play Robin Hood on the big screen, finds himself portraying the character in what is essentially a prequel to the story most people remember. This is, again, a good thing. To counter the objections to Crowe as Robin, he trimmed down for the role and, as can be seen in what I will refer to as ""the chain mail scene"", it worked beautifully. The back story of Robin Hood overlaps with one of the most storied periods in English history, and the appearance of characters like Eleanor of Aquitaine recalls the epic history of Henry II and the rest of the Plantagenet clan, giving the story sweep and arc, rather than allowing it to be subsumed in another campy remake of an already overly campy and worn out story.Crowe transforms Robin Hood into a smoldering warrior, but then, recall that his testosterone infused turn as Dr. John Nash made even a math geek macho. He also benefits, as he did in A Beautiful Mind, from a strong female lead, in this case Oscar® winner Cate Blanchett as Marion; clearly NOT a ""maid"" in this case, as a defiantly independent widow. Blanchett's Marion is a warrior in her own right, and she stands by her Robin in battle heroically.The merry men are all here, though, like Crowe as Robin, they are less absurdly merry than you might expect. The one exception is Mark Addy as the dipsomaniacal Friar Tuck. As for the rest of the merry men, they seem to have focused more on ""men"" and less on ""merry"", yet another good thing.This incarnation of the Robin Hood legend was a hotly sought after property. Every major role, including the leads and director, went through numerous changes or considered alternatives before being finalized and, while it's possible to envision a few other permutations, this one works just great. Brian Helgeland's story and script are superb, as one would expect. Co-writers Ethan Reiff and Cyrus Voris have collaborated successfully in the past, and the team seems to have worked well again.The most striking aspect of the movie, again as one would expect, is Ridley Scott's unmistakable direction. All the usual elements are here; rapid cut action shots, painterly compositions and dramatic lighting. But more than that, Scott's sense of the epic and heroic lift an otherwise tired story into a new and exciting realm.Most of the negative reviews I've read seem focused on the fact that this is not some tragic remake of a Douglas Fairbanks or Errol Flynn farce. I think this is its best point. This is not the best work of either Ridley Scott or Russell Crowe, but it is the best Robin Hood ever.",Robin Hood
144,dusan-22,Not that bad,6,25 December 2010,"From what I had read before I saw this movie I had negative expectations of this Robin Hood. However, I found the movie not that bad. I believe that Rusel Crow is made for such roles. Even though his acting from time to time was identical to parts he played in Gladiator, he was pretty good Robin Hood. A little bit strange turn in this movie takes you somewhere else as it develops the battle between England and France as between good and evil, instead of well known battle between saviors and tyrants of one country which was much closer to Robin Hood idea. This is why I assume that the one could have a small problem to praise Robin's character as he represented England in fight against France, after he came from the greatest sack and ravaging worldwide campaign in human history - ""Crusades"" led by these two countries. :) All in all, average entertainment.",Robin Hood

What happens thereafter forms the bulk of the movie.Analysis: The film is well made, but standard or average. This means like a safe, methodical driver, it pleasantly enough takes you from point A to point B, or from beginning to end, but with no big surprises or thrills along the way.You arrive safely, you appreciate it, and life goes on.

146,saarvardi,Better than Iron Man 2,9,12 May 2010,"I just came back from an early screening so I'll write this while the impression of the film is still fresh in my head.It's been many years since I've last watched any of the previous incarnations of the Robin Hood story, but I do remember the story has never been told in such a rich and detailed manner. In Ridley Scott's new film, the tale of Robin Hood is put into its historic perspective. However, this doesn't come at the expense of the old Robin Hood stories we all know and grew up on, and the plot puts much importance to classic characters such as Lady Marion (the always wonderful Cate Blanchett), Robin Hood's right hand Little John (TV's Kevin Durand from Lost fame) and others I'm not inclined to write down - seeing as I won't want to spoil the fun for anyone. Of course, Robin himself shines as the archer who seeks to return justice to old Britain circa 1199 AD, and the potent Russell Crowe portrays a worthy and fearless Robin.In many aspects, the story is more of an origins story for the character of Robin Hood - somewhat similar to what Batman Begins or Casino Royale did to the respective characters of Batman or James Bond. You only get to see how all the various stories in the film connect to the central Robin Hood arc - the one that follows the outlaw's war against King John's tyranny - towards the end of the film. However, how he got to be the protector of Nottingham's people, and how his relationships with the people surrounding him were formed and helped him become the noble victory fighter, is the where the heart of 2010's Robin Hood lies. Scott takes his time to establish this story, and leaves the door wide open for a sequel if he ever desires such.For its epic portrayal of an often forgotten time in history, for its depth in story and characters while creating magnificent action sequences as well - I give Ridley Scott's version of Robin Hood a strong 9 out of 10. This is how Hollywood entertainment should be like - smart and amusing both at once. And yes, it's miles better than Iron Man 2.Don't miss out on this one.",Robin Hood
147,deacon_blues-3,History takes a back seat to Gladiator in England,5,22 December 2010,"A beautifully filmed and acted film, Robin Hood is visually and dramatically impressive. But what are we to make of such an historically off-base film? Richard I did not die in France before returning from the third crusade. He died in England after receiving John's apology for trying to grab the throne. All the stuff about charters, Longstride, Locksley, yada-yada-yada, is either pure fiction or a hodge-podge of misplaced events. The film is a prequel to an intended sequel, I would assume. I know that chances are good that R.H. never actually existed (so say the modern historians for the nonce) but does that give us license to teach wrong history? If he did exist, he was a local figure who became legendary, not a legendary figure who changes from woodland outlaw into military juggernaut. The film is entertaining, but given the level of historical ignorance among moviegoers, this film does a disservice to the public. Gladiator was a fine fictional film, but I don't see why we have to use it as a template to rewrite another legend that was already entertaining, and do violence to history on the way.",Robin Hood

It looks magnificent, Ridley Scott's direction was stunning, much more exiting than Gladiator. Russell Crowe was heroic and I like him anyway, Cate Blanchett gets better and better with each film, and the supporting cast of top actors like William Hurt, Mark Strong, Max Von Sydow, Eileen Atkins, gave great weight to the whole production. Most frames look like old paintings, particularly the indoor scenes by firelight or candlelight. Wonderful cinematography I thought. Great script, great acting, great direction, great cinematography, what more can you ask. Loved it.",Robin Hood
149,C22Man,"Ah Robin, ya be a Right Eejit",2,2 March 2016,"When you really think about it every film based on the famous folklore of Robin Hood since Errol Flynn's swashbuckling classic in 1939 have been something of a let-down. Even the better takes on the story such as the enjoyably overblown Prince of Thieves and the more atmospheric Robin & Marian had their share of flaws. It's a story that allows for a number of different interpretations, yet deciding to do a grittier take on the character never really made much sense to me. In saying that on the surface you'd think the film could be great, Scott is a spectacular visual story-teller and Russell Crowe nearly always delivers the goods, but all the potential is ruined by a story that is too dour for its own good and some baffling decision making. The problem with the plot mostly revolves around how seriously it takes itself. The tale of Robin Hood succeeds when it is told as the folklore that it is and you can have a lot of fun in doing that, yet here there's an attempt to link it tightly to actual historical events and in doing so it sucks any of the pleasure straight out of the film. Everyone is very gloomy, all anyone ever talks about is the succession to the crown and the plot itself starts to get kind of convoluted as they try to hastily explain why anybody should care about what happens. Only the Merry Men are somewhat light-hearted, and even then they're more annoying that they are likable. Robin himself lacks absolutely any intrigue or wit that would make him an ideal lead character. He is simply boring which is exactly the thing the main character shouldn't be, his legend is never built up and he has little to offer beyond wanting to give a hand to those less fortune than him. Russell Crowe is simply serviceable as Robin, nothing more or less, and has the gruff look that works but his performance is crippled by an accent that seems to be on a walking tour of the British Isles. For the most part he sounds like he's taken a crash-course in Irish by watching Father Ted. At certain points (and this is no exaggeration) he sounded Scottish, Geordie and at one point he was just doing his normal voice. Where on Earth is he meant to be from? Cate Blanchett suffers in exactly the same area. Her Marian is a complete waste of the paper the script was written on, she does nothing of note and at times you forget she's even in the film. But her accent is mind bending. She does an RP English accent mostly, but then she'll say sentences that make her sound like she's from Somerset and at times she was going dangerously close to Eeh By Gum Yorkshire. She's from Nottingham for crying out loud. The Merry Men are just there for the sake of it and don't leave any impact beyond rather irritating. The likes of Mark Strong, Matthew Macfadyen and Max Von Sydow are completely wasted because of their dull as they come characters. Only Mark Addy as a reflective Friar Tuck and Oscar Issac as a slimy Prince John do anything with their characters.Visually it hard to knock the film. Scott is in his element when it comes to visuals and he delivers once again here, with a a real sense of Medieval England thanks to the majestic castles and the misty woodlands. The score by Marc Streitenfeld is just a typical, trying to be intense action film score and is entirely forgettable. The action scenes are actually impressively shot and are quite exciting the majority of the time, though the final beach battle is a farce. Not only was it like something from Saving Private Ryan with the landing crafts, but cliché lines are delivered to make you cringe and the editing is too frenzied for its own good. Scott only seems to success when he has a solid story or ideas to work (Ala Blade Runner and The Duellists) and fails when neither are all together there (Ala Hannibal and The Counselor). This is another effort where he simply hasn't got a gripping enough story or intelligent ideals for him to work with, as sadly his visual finesse can only go so far.Robin Hood once again proved that film-makers really seem to struggle at adapting the myth of the famed outlaw to the big screen. There needs to be a balance in order to make a story such as Hood's straight- faced without forgetting to make it legitimately enjoyable and that is where the films main failure comes from. Why try to attach it to history and then get your facts completely wrong, why not just have the tale exist in its own space. By making it downbeat and rough around the edges there is no entertainment to be had from watching Robin sulk or Marian do next to nothing or characters that we simply don't care about muttering away about the crown. Scott is an ambitious director, but even he can only do so much when the characters and plot are so dismally flat as they are here. In all honesty I think the accents alone are enough of a reason to avoid this very messy film.",Robin Hood
150,flapdoodle64,Robin as Revolutionary,8,4 October 2010,"While not a perfect film, Ridley Scott's Robin Hood is superior to most of the adventure and action films produced today, and is vastly better than the critics would have you think. Your feelings about Russell Crowe's personal life aside, he makes a fine, if somewhat mumbly, Robin Hood, and Kate Blanchet is is, as usual, marvelous as Lady Marion. The rest of the cast is also good, so that at the core, you have engaging and interesting characters, something in short supply with modern movies.While taking a few liberties with Medieval history, the director nonetheless is faithful to the spirit of the times and the early proletarian versions of the Robin Hood legends. At the same time, however, he weaves in enough of the Errol Flynn elements to satisfy fans of the romanticized Robin, all the while telling a rather new and different story than in previous incarnations.The pacing of this film is somewhat slower the ADHD hyper-kinetic tempo of most 'action' films currently in release, but IMO this is a good thing, as such films tend to be little more than non-interactive video games. Rather, what some incorrectly criticize as dull pacing is what used to be called plot and character development. Rest assured, there are plenty of fun, exciting, and suitably bloody, fight and action scenes, especially ones with medieval armies and horses.One failing is a bit of interesting but somewhat cryptic back-story inserted in Our Hero's life. The back-story is not the problem, but it is fit into the story in a rather awkward fashionsomething that could have been fixed with a bit more time in the editing room.While this film is fun and thrilling, it is also exciting to contemplate as political allegory. For this is the story of a nation led to ruin by the excesses and folly of the Ruling Class, bent on foreign military conquest and the acquisition of its own wealth. Within this setting, the focus is on Working Class heroes. Featured within this tapestry is a handsome and intelligent political leader who initially feeds the hopes of the proletariat, but then sells them out as soon his need for their support passes. Just as 1938 saw a Robin Hood for the Depression Era, the 2010 Robin Hood is clearly meant to evoke the circumstances of our own times.",Robin Hood

Nothing much happens in the movie for long stretches. The action scenes were standard fare, nothing very interesting. None of the characters stood out, except for the father of the Maid Marion character, and he wasn't around for that long. To be honest, I fell asleep during the movie a couple times, and only woke up when the action scenes returned. The movie is almost two and a half hours, and much of it is boring dialogs and dull characters and story line.

I will elaborate about some of the actors/characters.Russel Crowe/Robin Hood - Solid performance. At the beginning of the movie, I actually doubted his ability to deliver, because i felt that despite him being in the center of every shot, his personal charisma was significantly reduced. During filming he's got back to his old charismatic self, and delivered big. in general, it's very hard to believe that a simple archer could step up to be a born leader. something was missing.Mariann/Kate Blanshette - Great acting - absolutely not attractive.

155,jonnyfendi,"Another ""Gladiator"" in Sherwood Forest",6,13 May 2010,"Thiz movie is a new breed of Robin Hood from the father of ""Alien"" (1979), Ridley Scott. Robin Hood as we have known before is an honorable outlaw and great archer with tight pants, to rob the rich and give it to the poor. I know Scott wants his version of Robin Hood to be different. He is described with different haircut and beard. In fact, Russell Crowe performs the character in a similar way with his previous character in ""Gladiator"" (2000). You can see closely in his attitude and body language, the only thing that different is simply its outfit. On the other hand, Cate Blanchett provides a powerful performance as Marion. Blancett is one of a few Actresses who can always maintain her acting quality in each of her films. I think for her to involve in thiz epic is a completely waste of talent. The famous eternal villain of Robin Hood, Sheriff of Nottingham (Matthew MacFayden) is not in the focus of the story. But instead, the bad guy is a two-face traitor named Godfrey which is played by Mark Strong. In my opinion, he delivers the best performance for overall, along with William Hurt as King John's chancellor. Recently, Mark Strong has been successfully built a great image of bad guy figure. The movie is actually filled with unique and electrifying Score. For the final battle of thiz movie, I can describe it as ""Omaha Beach Attack"" in medieval version. It's just like what we have seen in the opening battle of ""Saving Private Ryan"" (1998), only thiz time with arrows and swords. The last four Ridley Scott's movies also appointed Russell Crowe as his main character. Substantively, Crowe never delivers a lame performance. But once again (Spoiler Alert!), thiz movie is really a copy-paste of Scott's ""Gladiator"", beside the same acting of Crowe, it's also about a warrior comes back to his hometown after patriotic battle and later he turns into a rebel to fight an evil King. Last time when we saw Kevin Costner's ""Robin Hood: Prince of Thieves"" (1991), we brought home some memorable moments and its Soundtrack still echoes until now. If audience can accept thiz movie as a decent movie, don't blame them (Scott and Crowe) if they are back again to offer you another typical ones with same Crowe's acting and same Scott's directing, maybe for the other time they will offer you with their version of Batman or James Bond or whatever.

157,jburtroald95,Clumsy but Fun,7,27 June 2010,"For the second time this year, after the wonderful Alice in Wonderland, a film has flamboyantly paraded into cinemas carrying the title of classic well-known fable, before quite unexpectedly presenting a darker side-story to the traditional tale instead of the original chronicle; although this time the result is considerably less satisfying.Sir Robin Longstride (Russel Crowe) and Prince John (Oscar Isaac) are to be transformed respectively into the familiar heroic bandit and his despicable adversary by a series of events that spring from the building bloodthirsty conflict between England and France. After King Richard the Lionheart (Danny Huston) is removed from the picture, the kingdom of England falls to ruin under John's rule, and the outlawed Robin has abandoned his now diminished station to rail against him. Impoverished peasants formerly viewed as pitiful scum now find themselves tied in with scores of other citizens from all manner of ranks, and the pervading turbulence could lead to an uprising at any moment.The film's purpose appears to be to build this familiar foundation that the main part of the original story is built upon. While the construction of this most extravagant prequel is at times quite intriguing, one is often made to ask the question ""Why take over two hours to do what has previously been done in fifteen minutes?"" It all feels rather pointless, especially during some of the duller patches conveying medieval warfare. Drawn out battle scenes dominate the screen time here, and if you've seen one you've seen them all, although when character relationships and political explorations take centre stage there are some true delights to be had.The villainy of Prince John is yet to full take shape, and for most of the film he is the childish substitute for his father who is overwhelmed by his throne and who closely mirror's Joaquin Phoenix's Commodus in 'Gladiator' (2000). Instead we are treated to a deliciously nasty and quietly dangerous Mark Strong villain: Sir Godfrey, a spy for the French who has cunningly wriggled his way into Prince John's select group of trustees. Cate Blanchett adds another noteworthy characterisation to the mix with her wonderful portrayal of the spirited Marion Loxley, who in this version is a feisty pauper rebellious from the beginning.Sadly Russel Crowe can not be considered among these cast members. At first he makes an admirable attempt with a believable English accent and a quirky nuance, but he quickly feels stupid and begins to don the stale Maximus persona, perhaps believing that another fluked Oscar will come his way. Director Ridley Scott has clearly miscast Crowe out of favouritism as it is impossible to see how this great sluggish hunk of muscle could ever be the whimsical Robin we've come to know, and that he is supposed to become by the end of the film.Among other dubious deviations leading to plot holes, and other inconsistencies, is the decision to have the King shot dead with an arrow, and not just have him captured. It has also been decided that he is a tyrannical brute instead of a legendary leader. His return at the end of the story is what resolves the complications, so his character cannot afford to be killed off or drastically changed.In summary, the premise here is teeming with creative concepts, but their dubious arrangement makes us unable to fully appreciate them; and it is a very good thing that the curtain closed after Robin was outlawed, or the scriptwriters would certainly have had their work cut out for them trying to repair the damages to the narrative.",Robin Hood

You know how the movies Henry V and Elizabeth felt more like a educational documentary than a moviewell this movie was kind of like that. First of all Robin Hood is a made up character from songs and legends that have only hints of applying to real people in history. So the main gripe I had about this movie is they complicated the heck out of the story line for some quasi-historical purpose that only makes it cumbersome and uninteresting. And sadly there were no grand battle scenes deserving of the Big Screen. Movie is OK for lets say 10 years and over.So in short, the story is overly complex and the action does not make up for it. If you want to watch Crowe in actionwatch Gladiator. If you want to watch Cate Blanchett rent Aviator or The Gift. If you want a action medieval moviewatch Brave Heart.

160,MovieZoo,Robin Hood: The best thing to come out of the forest ever!,10,14 May 2010,"I will begin by stating that I am NOT a history buff and I love a good movie. Knowing what I know of Robin Hood and knowing what I love about movies, I came out of this movie stunned. I was amazed by the story, the great acting, and the heart involved.This, in my opinion was a brilliant movie. With all that I already said, knowing this was a build-up to a sequel, I already am excited about what is to follow. Crowe and Blanchett were so perfect for the characters Robin and Maid Marian in this interpretation which was somewhat off from the books I read. He was beautiful as a deeply affected man who fell into his destiny and she was more than beautiful who accepted each and every challenge confronting this once privileged lady. I was moved by the old traditional romantic style used. How others were not moved is a puzzle to me. Anyway, both deserve Oscar mention for their efforts.Ridley Scott, you outdid yourself here. This was the best thing you ever did in my mind and heart. You definitely deserve Oscar mention. I was captivated by the beautiful scenery, the attention to details of the days of yore. The action was a little fast for me sometimes, but the effect was all I needed from what I saw. As the story moved on with all the action and tragedy surrounding everyone, there was plenty to keep me hungry and yet satisfied. Nothing felt forced or trivial.The casting really could not have been better. Von Sydow was magnificent and the actors playing Friar Tuck and Little John were great fun to watch and even added to the emotional aspect of the story. Godfrey, Prince John, the Sheriff of Nottingham, all of them were so well played, I could not believe my eyes. The Feral Children were odd and mysterious, but I have a feeling they will be a big part of the sequel as they aid Robin and the gang. The children who at first were a threat to citizens because of the starvation and curse of the period reminded me much of the lost boys in Peter Pan. I think that was intentional as there was always some correlation between Robin Hood and Peter Pan.Before I saw the movie, and I just got back from my second viewing, I was doubtful of romanticism. But there was no denying that romanticism was at the center of this story and movie. It was more than Robin and Marian findig each other. The romanticism was as much about the day and the night, evil and desire fill the hearts of many men and women. Damn, I love this movie!Thanks again for a beautiful movie and please hurry up with that sequel. I will see Robin Hood at least once more before the DVD.10/10",Robin Hood

My rating: 7
I planned to watch this movie since its original release 8 years ago. And each time I found something else to watch.
Finally all set up to enjoy the saga. And what can I say... It is a nice movie. You can have some laughs out of it, it has decent cinematography. Otherwise nothing special.
Also the duration is too long. The movie did not bore me but still I wished it would be half an hour shorter.

164,CherryBlossomBoy,"There won't be a sequel, people, get over it",7,23 March 2011,"It's clear that this ""Robin Hood"" is to the legend of the famous thief what ""King Arthur"" (2004) is to the legend of the famous Saxon monarch: an attempt to find the origins of the legend instead of retelling the legend itself and also to give it a more historical context. For those who may have looked somewhere else instead of at the screen for the last five minutes of the film, there was a proper conclusion given at the end. No need for sequels.Also a lot like ""King Arthur"", this take is only half good. What is good in it is what you always expect to be good when it comes to Ridley Scott and his team - the direction, the cinematography, strong and believable cast and art design. There are some impressive scenes to behold here and everyone should see this film at least because it's impeccably produced.The problem with ""Robin Hood"" is, as it usually is, the story. It handles the historical context part well. We get to see what the ""real Robin Hood"" might have been like and we witness the circumstances that might have contributed to the rise of a legend. It's intriguing, gritty and gripping for the first hour.Then suddenly the movie goes for the ""epicness"". Epic is what the tale of Robin Hood most certainly isn't. It can be a drama, it can be an action flick, it can be a comedy... but it cannot be an epic. No things on a grand scale ever happened in any Robin Hood story. He was a robber limited to Nottingham shire (or Sherwood Forest which, as I learned, is not in Nottingham shire) and his archenemy was the local ""shire reef"" (i.e. sheriff). No kings, no major geopolitics. He supposedly stole from the rich and gave to the poor and that's why folk loved him. He never ever was in charge of a grand army, an aide to the king or a champion of human liberties. In this rendition he becomes precisely all that and for no good reason.But today you obviously can't sell drama to large audiences and when you have Ridley Scott on board there are bound to be great battles and a higher purpose to everything. It worked marvelously in ""Kingdom of Heaven"" but it doesn't work here. A good comparison can be drawn with another Scott's epic, ""Gladiator"". People who love the story of ""Gladiator"" won't agree, but that story also failed because the main character was towards the end given a much larger purpose than the suspension of disbelief would allow.Having said all that, ""Robin Hood"" is still not a disappointment. It's well crafted and worth seeing, but bear in mind that the story is forced towards the end and crammed with characters, events and illogical plot devices. Even the precious direction of Ridley Scott fell apart here and there but one hardly noticed. Certainly not the sequel, but perhaps a longer, cleaner, ""directorial"" version is bound to see the light of day on DVD. Also worth a plus is not having a Bryan Adams song at the end credits.",Robin Hood
165,evan_harvey,It sucked,1,15 May 2010,"To begin with, it sucked. Now let me tell you why.Once upon a time, an archer named Rusty was the most noble and educated archer in King Richard's army. So noble and educated, in fact, that when he pretends to be a knight, no one can even tell the difference. So this noble and educated Archer ends up gaining the trust of all the barons in England, and leads them (and the King, mind you) in an heroic assault upon the French. In fact, when the French surrender, they do not surrender to the King of England, but to the noble archer named Rusty. That is the sum total of the film's plot. It has only a passing reference to the well-known story of Robin Hood. Oh, right. And at the end, the King is so incensed that the French surrendered to Rusty instead of him so he outlaws Rusty, and names him 'Robin Hood', and thus begins the legend.So what, I hear you ask, are the actual flaws in the film? Well, firstly, it is that Robin is clearly a noble and well-educated man, rather than a dirty Englishman who has been fighting for the last 10 years in Palestine. Given the storyline, it would have been so much better had Rusty been a common soldier, given that he then pretends to be a nobleman.Secondly, everyone listens to Rusty, as if only he really knows what he is talking about. No one else has any idea how to fight, and even the King of England listens to him.Thirdly, it appears that the main group who eventually become the merry men of Sherwood Forest are in fact a bunch of dirty English children who have run away from their mothers in Nottingham because all their fathers are away fighting in the Crusades, and now they pillage their own families and hide in the forest.Fourth, the French are so inept that this bunch of dirty English children ride into battle against the French army and _aren't_ completely slaughtered. Heck, anyone can grab a sword and kill a bunch of seasoned warriors - it's only the French for goodness sake!Fifth, anyone can pass for a knight, even an archer. After all, the only difference between a knight and a peasant is the clothes they wear.Sixth, it is only when an old man tells him about his heretofore unknown father, that Rusty remembers everything from when he was six! Like he'd never tried before! And how his father, a stone mason and accomplished philosopher, got all the Barons to sign a revolutionary and genius charter that challenges the feudal system in England!Now, the script wasn't poorly written, or the action scenes badly shot. It's just that there really wasn't much of a story, and certainly no theme at all. As such, there was nothing for the audience to connect with. I didn't care a whit that Robin Hood was banished as an outlaw. Russel Crowe can't act for spit, and he did a terrible, limp job. It seems that his default role is as a noble, yet betrayed quasi- aristocrat, allowing him to be heroic with almost no facial expression (except at the end when he's yelling). Cate Blanchett was unremarkable in every way. The other actors were passable.I was quite disappointed with Brian Helgeland's script. He's done better work, such as LA Confidential, which had both characters and plot. Robin Hood had almost neither of both. There were never any stakes involved, and only one brief moment when everything looked bad (Marion's abduction scene). The French were coming, so Rusty whipped everyone up and they went and fought and won. That's it. That's the movie. Nothing to care about, no characters to like, no danger and no point to the movie.A poor effort from all involved. 1 out of 10.EDIT: I have since discovered that the script for this film was originally a bizarre CSI style film set in medieval England where the Sheriff of Nottingham tries to apprehend Robin Hood. Then Ridley Scott decided that he wanted to direct a Robin Hood story, and who knows how it went bonkers from that point on. Apparently the original script was a bit crap too, but completely different from the end product.",Robin Hood
166,IcyTones,Rip-Off Britain,2,26 November 2020,"I spose this movie is a representation of how Robin Hood became an outlaw and how Robin Hood got started as a highwayman 'robbing the rich to give to the poor', but some of us don't care about the beginnings, we just wanna c a decent plot with loadsa action, battles, blood, gore & guts or at least a title that says what it is.When I see a title that says 'Robin Hood', I expect to see a movie that portrays what the legendary character is famous for, not the pathway leading up to the fame.At some point in our lives we will have at least one memorable & noteworthy cause that justifies letting our hearts rule our head, but, it's as if Robin Hood 'went 'soft' in the head' after swearing an oath to a dying man's request & taking the man's sword.

167,brettchatz-1,Crowe Fails Miserably,3,5 June 2010,"Russell Crowe stars as Robin Longstride, an archer in the army of King Richard the Lion Hearted. It's the year 1199 and all is not well in England. The monarchy is in tatters; the royal court is the subject of ill respect and the French King has nasty designs on the English Crown. Enter Robin Longstride aka Russell Crowe and his band of merry men.Firstly, this movie crawls along at a sluggish pace. Throughout its monotonous oozing, the audience was caught between trying to take it seriously and simply bursting out laughing with the comedic scenes and the faux set. Russell Crowe looks completely lost at sea. And this type of role sees him reprising a Gladiator-style presence that simply doesn't become him. The acting is poor, the action scenes are shoddy and this $200 million claptrap should be shelved in the B-movie archives.Kevin Costner nailed this role almost 2 decades ago. Russell Crowe has just proved that he is unsuited to these roles at his age. He does not look the part, he does not act the part and he certainly has little screen presence - which sadly is what Robin Hood needs a great deal of. This is the story of a legend, not some low-key character with no charisma. If you want to be entertained with a truly exciting version of Robin Hood, then Kevin Costner's version is the one you simply have to see.",Robin Hood
168,dudedazzreviews,Am I missing something here?,3,12 October 2010,"Robin Hood has been known to rob from the rich and give to the poor but there's one thing that Robin Hood can't give me and that is the two and a half hours I wasted on this movie. The story was average and gotten boring after the first ten minutes as all the characters did was nothing but talk (and unconvincingly at that). The characters weren't bad but you just couldn't care for them because they were boring, there wasn't much character development at all either so that didn't help. The acting is good, Russell Crowe does a good job playing Robin Hood but his performance strongly reminds you of when Crowe played Maximus in the movie Gladiator. Cate Blanchett does an average job as Maid Marion and Mark Strong does a great job as the bad guy Sir Godfrey. The action scenes were okay except for the end battle, which was brilliantly executed. However, the downside is they lasted about ten to twenty minutes each. The writing and direction weren't bad but I've seen Scott do much better.It was very hard for me not to walk out halfway through the movie. I started falling asleep (no, seriously, I actually started falling asleep) about forty-five minutes into the movie but luckily I stayed awake and endured the movie. The only exciting thing in the movie was the brilliantly done battle at the end but it's not worth money to see as it only lasts twenty minutes and the movie is two and a half hours. The acting weren't really too bad and Russell Crowe makes an okay Robin Hood but I just couldn't care for any of the characters in the movie at all. I didn't care for the story either, as it didn't grip you at all. It was surprisingly boring. Ridley Scott has definitely done better in the past. Robin Hood disappoints which is a shame because it had so much potential to be something better.

170,s_campanale,Invasion UK 1199AD,7,16 May 2010,"Went to see this film on Saturday night at the Empire in London not expecting too much given the overwhelmingly negative reviews, but in the end I was pleased to see what I had hoped to see, a good Summer blockbuster movie. The tone was light with a lot of humour, the battle lines very black and white and the politics wafer thin, romance OK and action great - Not burdened by pretentiousness or a misplaced sense of it's own importance (something that killed KINGDOM OF HEAVEN). I was glad that Ridley Scott and Russell Crowe decided quite unashamedly to go for a popcorn approach since that is what they are making here. If you set out to make a good hamburger then a good (or great..) hamburger should be the ideal end result, not a failed chicken chausseur Au Bordeaux! Many key summer movie elements were there - The Villain was very evil (and wore black) slaughtered several key characters (essential for last fight involvement) and even had a hideous scar after first encounter with hero! A rousing final confrontation - Yes everyone says is a rip off from Saving Private Ryan and totally unrealistic in mid medieval warfare...but it looked GREAT! Tough heroine -""warrior"" Maid Marion was good considering and not too unrealistic (actually there were many instances of women taking up arms in popular conflicts at the time) and a last 5 minutes nakedly setting up the next episode in the franchise a la BATMAN BEGINS. Hopefully that will come as I'd hate for this series to end after just one episode. One thing though that immediately struck us though was that the central plot line (Nowhere in any of the original versions of the script it seems) of a foreign undercover agent secretly unloading enemy troops in the middle of the night on a beach and then disguising them as natives to create havoc resentment and internal strife by violence in preparation for a pre-emptive attack was VERY similar to that of the great 80's opus ""INVASION USA"" (1985). It might just be coincidence, but it was very similar! I wonder if anyone else noticed this? If it was the case then it is a refreshing sign of popular culture happily quoting itself if Ridley Scott no less can now ape Chuck Norris and Canon Globus!",Robin Hood
171,tin-B,Alternative Acts,8,17 March 2017,"Thoroughly enjoyed this film from top to bottom. I have always had an open mind to different renditions and loved reading since I was 2 years old. I enjoyed the classic fairy tales and the lesser known tales and loved my book collection which featured all the various variations of those same fairy tales. Snow White varied greatly as did many others from one author/compilation to another. Thus, I am perfectly satisfied with a well done movie which does not follow the same path as the written version or prior film versions.People who didn't understand aspects of this film such as the children in the forest and other elements must not have actually watched it with both eyes open and ears cleaned of wax.Watch, listen, enjoy this version of Robin Hood which provides additional layers to the histories of the characters we love and hate in the legend of Robin Hood.",Robin Hood
172,GavWaskett,"Excuse me, where is that accent from exactly?",3,13 September 2020,"In fact I'll be happy if I never have to watch it again. There are many reasons for this, but I will list just three.
1. Robin Hood is an English Folklore Legend, he is famous for stealing from the rich and giving to the poor, he was a nobleman, who was cheated out of his land by the evil Sherriff of Nottingham and his henchmen Gus of Gisborne. All of this may have been nonsense, but a lot of folk tales are based on some historical facts. But this film, just ignored pretty much all of English folklore and created their own version, that's fine, but do a good job of it if you're going to rip up the stories I read as a child, teenager, man and teacher!
2. Russell Crowe and more specifically Russell Crowe's accent. Sometimes he is Scouse, sometimes Irish, sometimes Australian, never once is he from Nottingham. There were rumours of arguments between him and his voice coach, I wonder what accent they were in?
3. One beach scene has the French(I think, I really gave up after this) landing on the beaches, they landed in what were obviously the predecessors of World Ward II landing craft, back opening doors and everything,Don't watch this, watch Kevin Costner's Robin Hood Prince of Thieves, Disney's Robin Hood, Errol Flynn's The Adventures of Robin Hood or Mel Brooks, Robin Hood: Men in Tights or even if you can not get hold of any of these, Patrick Bergin's Robin Hood or even Taron Egerton's 2018 version, which has its own issues.

173,Minerva_Meybridge,Snooze Fest Sequel to Gladiator,5,20 May 2010,"Zzzzzzzz. Just saw it last night. Yes, Virginia, there is one dimensional film. With the exception of Max von Sydow (OMG, he was old in Three Days of the Condor and that was and that was in 1975!) the acting was about as flat as Twiggy's chest. Wake up, Russell! A little more vim in those sawed off words! Smile once, Cate! Sherwood Forest won't go up in flames. The version with Errol Flynn is still the most fun. The one with Uma the most enthralling. The one I saw last night, the best cure for insomnia! And JFC, he wasn't called Robin Hood because he was ""Robin of the hood."" RH isn't the frigging Green Arrow, and he didn't grow up in the hood. His name was Robert Hodd and Robin Hood was a nickname. I was just disappointed that Russell didn't crow out, ""I am Maximus Hood."" Now, that would have made a bland movie great.",Robin Hood
174,Marx_Bros_Fan86,Muddled,4,29 May 2010,"Ridley Scott set out to put his own unique stamp on the Robin Hood legend by changing many of its hallmark features. Robin is not a nobleman, but a commoner named Longstride posing as Robert Loxley, a nobleman. Maid Marion is not a rich, beautiful, respected woman, but a poor, widowed farmer. In essence, Scott's Robin Hood is more aware of the historical issues of the time, which does not make it historically accurate, but certainly less romantic. I liked the inclusion of the Magna Carta for its historical relevance if not for the clichéd way it is linked to Robin Hood. I believe this is the only Robin Hood movie to directly address it, which is certainly odd considering it is the most significant aspect of King John's reign. If another Robin Hood movie had to be made, this was certainly a promising direction to go in, but that is really the highest praise I can bestow upon this film.The movie was dismissed as ""Gladiator in England"" before it was even released, and while this criticism turned out to be partially true, it is not the central weakness of the film. Robin Hood simply has no direction from a plot or character perspective. Conceived as an origin story, Robin Hood could have been a character study, exhibiting Longstride's gradual conversion from law abiding citizen to outlaw. After creating such a strong, driven character such as Maximus, you would think character development would not be a problem for Scott. Yet this Robin Hood has no motivation. Crowe phones in his performance, drifting through the whole movie as if half asleep. But the script offers little help. We learn about Nottingham's poverty, and Robin decides to steal grain from the King's soldiers to help the town. But the character is not fully committed to anything until the last act of the film, which makes for a boring protagonist.The film had two plots, as far as I can tell. King Phillip of France was planning an attack on England. Unfortunately this conflict was developed at a lax pace, so it was not very involving, and Robin was not involved in it until the last third of the film. The other plot was King John's tyrannical taxation policies and the abject poverty the people face. This felt more like the central plot of the film, but it is left unresolved, probably for a sequel. Therefore, I am not even sure who the central antagonist of the film was supposed to be, King John or the French!Previous Robin Hood movies had simple but engaging plots and characters, whereas this version is just muddled. It has a poorly developed main character and the plot threads are not evenly divided into a main plot and a sub plot. Avoid this film like the plague.",Robin Hood
175,pepe4u22,Sucking the enjoyment out of a classic,1,15 May 2010,"Went to see the new movie of Robin Hood and I will just come out and say it the movie was a dreck and bored me to death..Problems are all over the place.. First problem the casting Russell Crowe is horrid he looks like he does not care and he seems to bring his thuggish off stage persona to the screen and i am not paying good money to see that crap..Second problem Cate Blanchett gosh she is has no charisma what so ever and the sight of her would send me to the woods for good for she comes off as a bitter and mean spirited person too great idea of casting two stars that have no intangibles that one would want to care about their characters..Third the direction is bland and the way I see it if it ain't broken why fix it the robin hood movie was always entertaining and fun and have a certain ""it"" quality best shown by Errol Flynn in 1938 yet Scott has basically put up a picture that is not entertaining not fun and a chore to watch..We go to movies to be entertained and not to be bored!!!!!!!!!!Fourth the backdrop was dreary and depressing and i know it is chic now for adding new spins on movies for realism but in this case it took the life out of the movie entirely! If you want to see a good movie about robin hood i noticed last week TCM had the definite Robin Hood movie with Errol Flynn watch that instead of this drivel and see what film making truly is and also what giving the paying customers what they want to see that is action and romance for this movie.

176,filmtravel101,Feels like Mini Series poorly written and meanders forever,4,21 September 2010,"Truly a good looking picture but so poorly written, convoluted and confusing that after the first hour one really wonders what the Producers and Writers were smoking and drinking. The story meanders across so many characters that there is no depth until finally at 1 hour plus Russell Crowe's character starts to develop with Cate Blanchett's.. but it is so trite one loses interest. It would have been better served as a mini series with so many plots and characters that could have been developed but it falls flat as a movie so be prepared to take notes and wonder why did the writers waste your first hour except perhaps to show more action battle scenes which by far are the most entertaining yet do not push the plot forward enough to merit a 200MM budget on this failure of a story. Great attempt by Ridley Scott and perhaps he will try a diff period piece to rival his wonderful Gladiator - perhaps Hanibal, Genghis Khan or ??Once again Hollywood fails to realize it is the Writer that creates the architecture for a story that flows to create a vision... and a myth.",Robin Hood
177,fred-houpt,Medium quality from top to bottom,6,2 June 2010,"I am a fan of Crowe and Scott so of course I was attracted to watch the film. My knowledge of the ""real"" Robin Hood was very little, but I had the notion that he, like King Arthur, was much mythologized. In both cases it appears that the clear identification of one particular person fixed in time still evades considerable investigation. Both play a large role in English folklore and have been covered numerous times in movies. The last and now sadly silly Robin Hood film I saw was Kevin Costner's attempt. The one single redeeming memory from that film was the terrific love song at the end of the film written and performed by Canada's Brian Adams. Otherwise a film completely stolen by Alan Rickman. What then of Ridley's portrayal? Given the opportunity to show that he had done his research he came back half done and then shot this sprawling epic. What we get is an action flick filled with clichés of the genre; this is just one of it's several unfortunate disappointments and misgivings. The film is crafted strictly along commercially viable lines that cater to the majority of film goers. No small art house purity shining here; this is big, expensive, boisterous and oh, so Hollywoodish. The sacrifice of authenticity while pandering to the masses is sad given how much energy is expended making a film this large look historically viable.There are laughable historical impossibilities that are worth making fun of. If Robin lived in 12'th century England, then having his fun loving friends enjoy a song and dance blast with music that is best placed in 20'th Century East Coast of Canada is foolish at best. The music of his era is known and it could have been reproduced. But, that would have robbed Alan Doyle, the lead singer from Newfoundland's Celtic folk group ""Great Big Sea"" from his rousing numbers. At this point in history, Scottish people were enraged at the very severe taxation he had heaped upon them to pay for his disastrous Crusade march to the Holy Land. So, to see a Scottish warrior tagging along with King Richard is just not going to happen. Probably the same would hold true for the Irish as well. The depiction of the French defending a small castle as slavishly devoted to their hungry stomach, abandoning their posts as soon as supper arrives is just too ridiculous and I just have to think that it is meant as a joke.Sadly there were zero kinetic sparks between Crowe and Blanchett, much to my surprise. Almost without exception Robin Hood is depicted as a glowering and somewhat distracted bloke who somehow survived 10 years of slaughter and deprivation without much to show for it. I think that Crowe might have subconsciously had in mind to portray a person deep in post traumatic syndrome and it's a shame he didn't do more with that idea. The fight scenes were all anti-climatic, anticipated many minutes before each one and after hundreds of others in the offing, this one was filled with typical gestures that were largely uninteresting. While it might be true that since we do not really know the true story of who Robin Hood was and therefore this lack gives greater artistic and interpretive freedom and space I found the direction that Ridley and the scriptwriter took was too middle ground. Lots of gnarling, smashing of huge swords, endless swishes of overly accurate arrows, lots of bodies being impaled. Ho hum...another epic. This version of the tale, with a terrific actor who could not make up his mind on what type of accent he was trying to work with, could have been more rewarding if more risks had been taken, a more gritty and honest approach, perhaps moving the classification into the adults only maturer audience....Instead we got a tepid version of Gladiator and that's disappointing.",Robin Hood
178,lopcar1993,The Rise of a legend....,9,22 May 2010,"For the last 588 years, a legendary story has been passed from generation to generation about a man, a man who stole from the rich and gave to the poor wit not thought to his own actions. This man is the most legendary of all folklore heroes in fact the most legendary of all heroes he is the man who inspire comic book like Batman, The Spirit and most notable of them all The Green Arrow. This man is called Robin Hood a fabled hero, a legendary archer who gave up his position in the high life to help the less fortunate. However, we do not know that for sure. Many people do believe that an archer who went by the name of Robin Hood did exist while others deny the fact that the man ever did exist and believed him to be nothing more than a folklore tale meant to scare the king's soldiers and the sheriff of Nottingham. Ridley Scott (director of Black Hawk Down, Gladiator, Kingdom of Heaven, Thelma and Louise and Blade Runner) takes the oft-told tale of one man and his band of merry men and how they took on the system, how they became legends. How they took the country of England by storm and made a lasting impression on the history books and time itself this film is the story of that man this film is the origin of ""Robin Hood."" Ridley Scott is a director know more for his epic adventure films such as ""Black Hawk Down(2001), Kingdom of Heaven(2005), Gladiator(2000) he is also know for dark films such as Thelma and Louise(1991), Alien(1979) and one of the most influential Science Fiction films of all time ""Blade Runner""(1982). Scott is a fantastic director he knows what he wants and he sets out to make it. With ""Robin Hood"" Scott returns to what truly made him famous epic adventure films ""Robin Hood"" is a classic medieval war movie wrapped in Scott's typical grit and violent style that has worked for him so many times before and has brought in allot of cash for him as well."" Robin Hood"" is so much more than just your typical adventure film; in fact, this picture is several type of films rolled into one. It is a love story, a revenge thriller and a war drama all of these different types of genres, or sub-genres as you would like to call them. Are combined effectively into one to create a daring new and original vision of the legendary figure that only the likes of Ridley Scott and Russell Crowe could deliver, ""Robin Hood"" proves that just because Scott is old doesn't mean he is out.I liked the atmosphere of this film it is soaked in grit, blood and grim and it gives the legend of Robin Hood a darker and more palpable feel than the previous incarnations in the past it's a rougher and more gritty Robin Hood adventure than a mainstream audience is use to but for fans of Scott and Crowe this is movie heaven(Much like it was for me) but even though I am massive, massive fan of both Scott and Crowe it did not affect my opinion of this film at all it just gave me a reason to see this film. It is not as silly as most Robin Hood adaptations have been in the past in fact Ridley Scott's interpretation cuts out the silly (which in most films can be called the intermediary) and takes it down a more serious path. This film is not without its lighthearted moments and to me that lift the mood form the dark and macabre feel of this adventure film giving it just the right touch of comedy mixed in with the action makes this new adaptation of Robin Hood a merry old time.Russell Crowe is an actor who is not afraid to try anything he has taken on almost all the tough roles from playing a volatile cop in "" L.A. Confidential"" to playing a Roman General turned Gladiator in ""Gladiator"", to playing a selfish stoke broker who finds love in ""A Good Year"". Crowe is fearless and that is why I love his movies he does not hold back on you and gives you his all that is why no matter what Crowe movie you are watching you know you are going to get far better than you would expect. With ""Robin Hood"" Crowe delivers a performance that is both powerful and commanding, he literally owns the screen. Moreover, if anyone else was in the title role say Orlando Bloom (Kingdom of Heaven, he was reasonably good in that one) this film would fall apart you need someone of Crowe's stature to play a role like this because only he can make it work. With Scott's sharp direction Russell Crowe and the rest of the cast including Max Von Sydow, Vanessa Redgrave, Gordon Pinsent, Cate Blanchett, William Hurt and a devious and cunning performance from Mark Strong as Sir Godfrey all deliver strong performance in a film that exceeds all expectations and puts a new, fresh, gritty and brutal spin on an old legend.This film is not perfect and it does not pretend to be instead Ridley Scott and his team aim for near-perfection without actually coming close to being perfect. ""Robin Hood"" is what you would expect from Scott a brutal, vicious and dark medieval war drama with a hint of inspirational meaning thrust into the midst of all the ensuing action. What you can take away form this film is that you came out entertained and enthralled b y this sprawling epic film that may have less heart that ""Gladiator"" but more soul than you could ever imagine.",Robin Hood
179,scheelj,"Medieval D-Day is not on Normandy, but plenty of Normans",6,24 July 2012,"See it - This epic movie follows the standard model of an opening action sequence, a bunch of smaller-scale skirmishes in the middle, and a long and climactic battle at the end. The opening battle is an intense castle siege, which would rival that of ""Lord of the Rings"" if not for its short duration. The ""meat"" of the story is full of quick, ""ho-hum"" battles. But the grand finale is worth the wait. The final battle is a unique beach assault, which is basically a medieval version of D-Day. It's not on Normandy but there are plenty of Normans. This Robin Hood origin story is completely different than any version you have seen. It focuses less on his archery skills and portrays him as simply a common soldier. I don't want to give too much awaybut regardless of how you feel about the unique storyline, you have to admit that Russell Crowe is a better Robin Hood than Kevin Costner. 3.5 out of 5 action rating",Robin Hood
180,Mr_PCM,"A good historical action film, but no historical 'epic'",7,8 January 2011,"There have been countless adaptations of the legend of Robin Hood over the years, and because the story is simply that – a legend – the facts of the time of the outlaw are vague at best. As a result, film-makers have been able to cherry-pick the bits of the story they liked and dispense those that they didn't, with little fear of the backlash from historical purists. For Ridley Scott's turn with the Robin Hood tale, he has made Robin an identity thief with a sense of honour, Marion a feisty widow, Richard Lionheart a somewhat bloodthirsty warrior with little care for his country (more than a smattering of accuracy there) and John a vain and foolish but more sympathetic and brave new monarch, while the Sheriff of Nottingham is relegated to a sleazy minor local enforcer and the majority of the Merry Men more resemble the Lost Boys. As a result of this, deviations from the accepted and well-known 'facts' of the story are both refreshing and often jarring.Scott has created an origin story that all but had 'part I' emblazoned on the posters, with well-formed characters that are slightly less caricatured than 'Prince of Thieves' from twenty years prior. His original premise envisioned a role reversal between the Sheriff and Hood, portraying the typical villain in a much more sympathetic light, which could have been fascinating. After extensive re-writing and actors' strikes, the resulting film is much more traditional. An interesting origin story, but it could have been so much more. This film tells of how Robin returned from fighting of the Holy Land and gained the identity first of Robert of Loxley and then of the famous outlaw. He quickly establishes a reputation as a hero who must fight to save his country and its people. Meanwhile John's closest friend Godfrey (Mark Strong) has secretly allied himself with the French and is covertly working to stir up trouble in England to aid an invasion from across the channel. The story is relatively simple, but easy to follow and effective for developing the character of Robin Hood.Russell Crowe's portrayal of the eponymous hero is everything audiences have come to expect from the former Maximus but with the added 'bonus' of an accent which is virtually a veritable grand tour of the British Isles – entertaining but inconsistent and thus difficult to take seriously, calling to mind as it does such efforts as Mel Gibson's Braveheart and even the now-legendary Dick van Dyke's Bert the Chimney Sweep. Even Kevin Costner had the sense to not even attempt and English accent! Meanwhile, Cate Blanchett as Lady Marion gives a typical strong performance that gained her such acclaim in 'Elizabeth' but somehow seems too old and worldly for the role. Mark Strong plays the villain of the piece by the numbers, and is acceptable but nothing more; a hissable villain who stays only a step or two above pantomime through keeping the typical bad guy theatrics to a minimum.The action scenes are everything we have come to expect from Ridley Scott; exciting, fast-paced and numerous, full of quick editing and some panoramic sweeps. However, in the depiction of the developing relationship between Crowe's Robin and Blanchett's Marion he is less sure-footed, and the chemistry between the pair is somewhat lacking and does not ring true. The most intriguing performances come from Oscar Isaac as an understated and more ambiguous King John, and Eileen Atkins as the underused Eleanor of Acquitaine. Meanwhile Robin's sidekicks are simply not given anything to do other than provide some comedy relief in the manner of the three stooges – hardly establishing them as a fearsome band of merry men - although the merry part is certainly emphasises through numerous singing, dancing and drinking scenes! Overall a satisfying film that nicely establishes how Robin Hood came into being, but the constant feeling of 'franchise starter' that might as well come in flashing neon subtitles, and the knowledge of what the film could have been leaves something of an empty, almost cheated feeling. Yet with Russell Crowe's presence, Robin Hood remains an enjoyable action film – but nothing more.",Robin Hood
181,petit76,quite a mediocre,3,17 May 2010,"I have been a confirmed RS fan since Blade Runner. His ability to depict alternate places and times, and make entertaining action films not devoid of intellectual content is refreshing. With Robin Hood something went terribly wrong. The movie appears at first be going into the backside of the legend. Recall Richard comes back to England, and then promptly goes on another Crusade from which he doesn't come back (with zany consequences....Magna Carta). From the point at which Richard is killed, the plot falls apart. The only thing I can think is that because of the high dollar talent something happened with the studio. The fact that the storyboard images shown during the credits contain content not contain in the film itself might be a clue. The whole film gives one the feel of having been painted into a corner.Evren Buyruk, Gold Coast Australia.",Robin Hood
182,imxo,Ludicrous,3,15 May 2010,"Ridley Scott's ROBIN HOOD is a horrible disappointment. The movie is dark and depressing, and every man in it seems to be a thug, including the hero himself.Scott has made every character in this film loathsome, irritating or ridiculous. Friar Tuck is a smarmy half-wit, Little John has the intelligence of a tree stump, and Russel Crowe's Robin Hood must be the most uncharismatic hero of all time. Maid Marian would have to be really hard up to have anything to do with the likes of this plebeian Robin Hood. Of all the characters in this movie, only the one played by Max Von Sydow generates any real empathy. This movie is so bad that in one of the final battles I actually found myself laughing. Frankly, Scott should stick to making movies about Avatars and leave Britain's legends, culture and traditions alone.The director almost seems to be attempting to destroy the legend of Robin Hood with this abysmal movie. What's really going to happen, of course, is that the legend of Robin Hood will survive, but this film will quickly find it's way into your local supermarket's DVD bargain bin.",Robin Hood
183,garyvanhorn,A great legend mangled beyond recognition.,4,10 January 2011,"Let's get a couple things out of the way: Robin Hood is not real, he is a legendary character and is, for all intents and purposes, wholly fictitious, yet set in 12th century England. Since the whole story is made-up, you can make the villains anyone you want, set it in any year you want, and have the plot go pretty much anywhere you feel like. That being said, the story of Robin Hood is so iconic that messing with any of the following will severely hurt the feel of the story: robs from the rich and gives to the poor, Sherwood Forest, Maid Marion, The Merry Men, Friar Tuck, Prince/King John, The Sheriff of Nottingham, archery, England, and King Richard. You can get by with a few tweaks here and there, combining villains, offing King Richard, and minor characters eliminated/added, but if you eliminate everything but the names you end up with the dreadful film directed by Ridley Scott.The movie really boils down to: Robin Hood comes back to England after the death of King Richard as he was returning from the third crusade and finds English traitors working with the French to destabilize and invade England. Robin helps lead an army to combat the invaders and saves England, then is branded an outlaw and slips away into the forest as the screen fades to ""So the legend begins"" and the credits roll.So what went wrong? In a nutshell, everything except the kitchen sink (and only because indoor plumbing hadn't been invented yet). Russell Crowe could have been a cadaver in chain mail and been more interesting and exciting. In this film Robin Hood has been stripped of everything that made the character worthy of legend. There are no merry men, Sherwood Forest is a footnote, The Sheriff of Nottingham is more like a prop than a character, King Richard is dead, Friar Tuck is a twit, the romance with Maid Marion is mostly left to your imagination, the villains keep waffling on their villainy, and robbing from the rich to give to the poor is still in the planning stage; all because the movie is a prequel that is set before Robin Hood became a legendary folk hero. Why on God's green earth would you want to take such a legendary story and turn it into a ""before they were famous"" piece. Nobody cares what Robin Hood did before he became the legendary outlaw because it's interminably boring, as this film clearly shows.Most of the characters are woefully underdeveloped and appear in the film only because they are ""supposed"" to be there. The action sequences aren't impressive in any way but they did make me wonder exactly when a peasant archer (Robin Hood) came across the skills of horseback riding, swordsmanship, and mounted combat. To be fair, all the other peasant archers had horses too, so why not I suppose? The battle sequences were less than spectacular and held precisely zero suspense. I noted English casualties were next to nothing during the final climactic encounter with the invading French army, so I guess there was a little suspense because I was wondering if any English soldiers would get killed at all.",Robin Hood
184,andro-dolic,Surprisingly good and effective,9,16 May 2010,"There are only few things which I can tell about Robin Hood . We all know his life and legend but through movies he was shown in many different visions . Looks like he is old story in movies and that he will enter in classic but then we got new and really different Robin Hood . This movies are one of the most adventurous movies in history . Maybe it was big risk to take this theme but Ridley Scott knows how to make spectacle of the movie . There are many exciting things about this movie . In waiting for movie premiere we could hear a lot of things like this Robin Hood is trash and it isn't following history of Robin Hood . But people were naive and before watching this movie they believed in this fake facts . I think that this movie deserved better critics . Actually,what happened to a critics ?Ridley Scott as director is known by Gladiator and his sense for this kind of movies and his fighting scenes really have sense . I think that his decision was very good and he wanted to show one really known story . As the result he could realize that people don't know how story really is . His smart directing made this movie . Maybe movie is missing a few adventurous parts and sometimes he desperately put some parts . I don't think that his showing of history was the best . Maybe Merry Men were sometimes without real spirit from other movies . Ridley showed that he knows how to show already seen theme on one modern,great and effective way . Russel Crowe as Robin Hood was great . Whole cast played very well . Russel Crowe really knows how to mix different roles and he is master for it . His sense for these fighting scenes and for love scenes is impressive . I don't think that he was bad . He was very disciplined during whole movie and I can't see some problems . He was very inspired and he was serious and his strong performance is really stunning . I couldn't believe when I saw him in fight scenes because his wildness and great action acting were great fact . I don't know why he was attacked because of this movie and accent . I think that he doesn't look like some British hero but he doesn't look ridiculous like former movies . Cate Blanchett as Lady Marion wasn't maybe the best because of her demanding role . Her role was maybe different and she wasn't like Audrey Hepburn but her appearance was really good . Maybe director wanted too much from her role but she showed how this difference can be positive . He improved vision of her role with one convincing role . I think that I am surprised because I didn't think that she will do this so well and that she could act one female hero or better to say one example of good female character . Max Von Sydow as Walter Loaxley was very good and he had great spirit during the acting . I think that he was very good and with his experience this movie got one new division . His great acting showed how he has got sense for this roles . Mark Strong as Godfrey was very good villain and I think that he has got great and provocative acting . Maybe he sometimes looked aloof but when we see how complicated is his role we can tell ""Nicely done !"" . William Hurt as William Marshall wasn't so good as others because his role was totally different . He didn't find himself so well as others so he sometimes was out of pace . Oscar Isaac was maybe bad because of his constantly aloof acting and sometimes he looked very childish . I think that he didn't have so strong performance for this role . Danny Houston was pretty good and he had very strong performance and his wise acting was damn good . When we look everything I think that Ridley Scott didn't miss theme . He showed how imagination can be powerful . Cast was great and fighting scenes absolutely stunning and great . All in one . Great movie .",Robin Hood
185,d_art,"'Robin Hood' is a mistitled, mixed bag",7,19 May 2010,"This Ridley Scott-directed version of the Robin Hood legend stars Russell Crowe as the title character. Robin Longstride (Crowe) is a common archer in the Third Crusade led by King Richard the Lionheart, who is killed in battle. Richard's arrogant brother, John, takes over Richard's throne as a result, and starts heavily taxing his people. Sir Godfrey (Mark Strong), an English Knight with French ancestry and an agent of the French King stirs up unrest in England so France can invade England. Meanwhile, Robin and his band of warriors try to unite England to defend itself from France.I have to admit that when I first saw the trailer, the whole gritty, grungy, yet perhaps realistic, look of the film didn't quite do it for me. I've now seen the movie, and I've realized I was still quite right about that. The Robin Hood tale has always been the more colorful, adventurous, and happier of the legends out there. Gone now is much of the witty dialogue and youthful fun I've come to appreciate in these adventures. This is a somber, grey and gritty take on the legend. The problem isn't that this film is grey and gritty—it's just that every period action film these days seem to have that quality. I loved Ridley Scott's Gladiator. This film feels like an English version of Gladiator. Likewise, it also stars Russell Crowe, playing a tough warrior-type, which admittedly have started to feel like a cliché after 10 years. The issue is that I've already seen Gladiator, and this film feels like a lesser version of it.When King Richard the Lionheart died, I could tell the film was going to be a downer. One of the big reasons why Robin Hood was heroic to many people, despite being an outlaw, was the fact that he was loyal to the true king—King Richard. Here, Robin is kind of a mercenary, and is mostly thrown into the action by chance. His romance with Maid Marion (with a fine performance from Cate Blanchett), who needs a new husband to keep her land since her husband's death (news that Robin was delivering to her), feels convenient and tacked on.Russell Crowe looks quite aged to be playing Robin Hood. His haircut and beard is reminiscent of Maximus (from Gladiator), except the whites in his beard is quite visible now. He also doesn't feel as quick, accurate, or athletic as he used to. He's certainly no Errol Flynn. His performance is fine as always, but his character isn't anything new, unique, or really that different from Maximus, except that character was more honor-bound. The script doesn't really make him all that interesting as he should be. His archery skills are de-emphasized. By the time Robin is riding his horse in full speed and someone throws him a sword in slow motion—a replicated scene with the same angle that was in Gladiator—it feels like self-parody. C'mon, Mr. Scott, did you expect this scene to feel just as dramatic the second time around? The side characters, such as Will Scarlet (Scott Grimes) and Little John (Kevin Durand) are fun to watch, but they don't really stand out in this film compared to the previous adaptations of the tale. Likewise, Sheriff of Nottingham (Matthew Macfadyen) is also underused, relegated to a few lines. Oscar Isaac is fun as the prideful King John and Mark Strong is noticeably memorable as Sir Godfrey.Supposedly, they tried to make this film closer to history. What is odd is that the whole plot didn't really have to involve Robin Hood at all. While he appears in much of the movie, the film's focus is really on the politics, King John, and his relationship with France. It all leads up to a huge war scene between France and England at the beach, intricately and dramatically done, eerily similar to the D-Day storming scene from Saving Private Ryan. After a while, having Robin Hood in the story felt more like the afterthought. Many other little things happen in the film (e.g. orphans who live in the forest and Robin's father's backstory), but they also feel crammed in there, blended into something familiar, mechanical, and bland.This film is actually more like a prequel to the legend of Robin Hood. By the time we get to know Robin Hood the way we've always known him, that outlaw from Sherwood Forest (which will perhaps be the focus in the sequel), Robin will be even older. Generally, in this case, things have been changed around so much that it has lost that familiar charm. I give Robin Hood ** 1/2 out of **** stars",Robin Hood
186,montera_iulian,Robin Hood or Robin Longstride?,6,16 May 2010,"Honestly, my expectations for this movie were not that big so I wasn't so enthusiastic about it. Other than that I was expecting only to like the movie but now I just don't know if I liked it or not. Yes, I enjoyed it but it was getting boring after a while because it just missed something. That something is the essence of the main character, or at least the character who should be the main one, Robin Hood. The main issue was that this movie is not based on Robin Hood's life but on Robin Longstride, the man before he became Robin Hood thing that didn't impressed me that much.The script is based on the popular story of Robin Hood, which was a brave supporter of king of England Richard ""Lion Heart"" and after king's death he was proscribed and made an outlaw by Richard's brother, King John. The story is well delivered though the dialogue has some lame moments. The English humor was present in the movie but some lines were just ridiculous like ""To Who? (question asked by King John to Marshall after the french gave up)"" which sounded real dumb and hilarious for a movie like this. The movie was pretty good but the way it was sold is just wrong. When you sell a ""Robin Hood"" movie to the general audience then give the audience a movie about Robin Hood and not about how Robin Hood became Robin Hood especially when the title of the movie is simply ""Robin Hood"". The movie despite it was 2 hours and half long, you get to see Robin Longstride for like 30-40 minutes and Robin Hood for only 5... I mean WTF were they thinking'? This movie is actually more based on the two brothers Richard and John. The character development was pretty good though I haven't felt a chemistry between Russell and Cate.The acting part was pretty good, Cate doing a great role by not over-use sentiments as a cover up and really show a strong woman, Mark Strong who is Godfrey, King John's traitor (obviously the bad guy in this movie along with King John) is no different than the guy in Sherlock Holmes, It's the same EFFIN acting. Max von Sydow's acting was like some old noble, sarcastic wise man drain out straight from Lord Of The Rings or Harry Potter, that accent and character was hilarious. Prince/King John, interpreted by Oscar Isaac got into his role pretty well though the script didn't actually helped him appear more than a douche and a real stupid young man... which I doubt out there, in the world, at that time, there lived a king who could be that dumb... I mean they made King John a simple joke. Russell Crower was good but I just can't say he had a real performance in this movie since most of the time you don't see him doing any Robin Hood stuff.The video editing was above mediocre because there was a lot of closed-captioned shots and all were cut very fast especially when there's fighting involved. Large captioned shots improve the visual aspect in a movie like this, we have so many examples from Lawrence of Arabia to Alexander or Troy. The cinematography was the same, above mediocre because it didn't offered any specific scene that you will remember after leaving the theater, I mean they could at least offered some emotions and pour them into those scenes but ... nothing. That's why it was really boring after a while. Many useless shots in a 2 hours and half long movie. They could have easily deleted some 20-30 minutes from the movie and it would have appeared to be a whole lot better.The score, the soundtrack for this movie was nothing new. It was good but nothing captivating. I honestly did not like the rock elements introduced in the music because they didn't fit that age. But hey, that's just me, I won't bash the soundtrack just for that.Overall the movies is entertaining but could get boring after like over one hour because it is not what many wanted to see... which is Robin Hood... it's just a story about this guy who became Robin Hood. And yeah, I forgot, after 2 hours and 20 minutes into the movie, you realize that all that fighting, all that bravery was for nothing. That was a big F*** OFF to the audience even though it was pretty accurate based on the cultural story about Robin Hood.It's a good movie but NOT a Robin Hood movie. And that my friends is where the big mistake was made. I gave it a 7 just for the illusion that I enjoyed it... but honestly it deserves a strong 6 (SIX).",Robin Hood

This movie tells the origin of Robin Hood. So, it tells the origin of Robin Hood.The story is amazing. There are so many links between the characters that sometimes, I might be confused. Basically, it's about the origin of Robin Hood. In his origin, there are a lot of unexpected events in the story. There are many characters that I thought wouldn't appear in the film. So, the story is good, very good.Now, to how well the movie was presented.The beginning of the movie starts with a battle. It was exciting and good. It built tension and a big amount of tension. Well, after the battle, the movie focused more on the drama. The drama sections introduced many other characters. The drama section also started building tension but slowly.The battle at the end was enjoyable. It was long enough to satisfy you and was pretty much exciting. There were maybe thousands of warriors fighting and it was awesome. That was the most exciting scene of the movie.Well, after the fight scene, I thought there were only going to be like five minutes until the end of the movie. But, there were still like three more scenes after the end. That made the film start to look boring. But anyways, the movie was good. 7 stars!",Robin Hood
188,jfcthejock,"An Alright Film, But Definitely Not Historically Accurate",6,29 November 2010,"The 2010 adaptation of the Robin Hood legend, by Ridley Scott is simply an alright film to me. It made an enjoyable film for the evening but thats about it and as I watched, it was indeed a different reworking of the legend to portray Robing Hood as a commoner and not the man of nobility, who took the identity of Robin of Loxley. That a single man defied a King, and became an outlaw you would think this would be in history books but no, its legend.As for the cast Russell Crowe would have not been my first choice to play Robin Hood, he continuously fell out of his English accent into a mix of Yorkshire, Irish and at one point Welsh. If that weren't bad his band of merry men including Little John played by Kevin Durand who's portrayal of a Scotsman is quite appalling being i'm Scottish myself, as he too slips between an Scottish accent to an Irish one quite poorly. However one actor kept me watching and that was American Scott Grimes playing Will Scarlet, with a Welsh accent. He is definitely on his way in the business, as he can pull off a Welsh accent for an entire film. However the poor performances did not finish there, they continued with many American actors portraying English characters, and at times it got quite annoying. Again however just like Scott Grimes, British talent Mark Strong stole the show for good British talent in the film. The battle scenes were strong but again followed the scenes in Gladiator, just in a more gritty environment. Robin Hood is an enjoyable film, however nothing revolutionary and certainly not without its problems, even with Ridley Scott directing it with a big budget.A film for an early evening as its quite a long film, especially the Director's Cut of the film which I saw.",Robin Hood
189,Red_Flag,...until lambs become lions.,9,12 May 2010,"Director: Ridley Scott Starring: Russell Crowe, Cate Blanchett, Mark Strong Running Time: 140 minutes Genre: Action | Adventure.I know what you're thinking! A sense of Déjà Vu has just come upon you right? I mean how many times must we hear the same story told countless time...to be perfectly honest, for Ridley Scott I'll be happy to hear it one more time. I'm not going to make it a secret that Scott is, for all extensive purposes, my favourite director. So much so that kingdom of Heaven (a film unfairly critically panned) stands as one of my favourite films of all time! His retelling of Robin Hood is a joy to watch striking a perfect balance between humour and tragedy. Though Scott's master stroke is in the films scope, the sheer beauty and authenticity make for what is most certainly the best version of Robin Hood to date.Director Ridley Scott and actor Russell Crowe reunite for their fifth big-screen outing, a retelling of the Robin Hood legend featuring the Gladiator star in the titular role. A bowman in the army of Richard Coeur de Lion, virtuous rogue Robin Hood rises from an unlikely background to become a hero to the impoverished people of Nottingham and lover to the beautiful Lady Marion (Cate Blanchett). Cyrus Voris, Ethan Reiff, and Brian Helgeland collaborate on the screenplay for a costume adventure produced by Brian Grazer (Frost/Nixon, American Gangster).Refreshingly, this Hood ends where most of the tales begin acting as a prelude to the story we've come to love. It works tremendously and silences the only gripe I had before seeing the movie. We asked ""does the world really need to see this story again?"" and Ridley Scott gave his answer in the form of a new tales that's both epic and emotionally resonating. Die hard's will scoff but I won't hesitate to say that the story being told here is better than the one told in previous iterations. One sub-plot overstays its welcome and at times the film's tone can turn from dark to downright silly but the genius lies in the pacing! Throughout the entire film, not once did I find myself distracted, even for a second. This is a perfect balance of action and story that never lets up until the final curtain falls.Ridley Scott is an astounding director; he doesn't need to prove that to anybody! So it's wonderful to see just how much effort he has added to the mix here. From stunning scenery to startling landscape, it's hard not to gaze slack jawed at just how phenomenal everything looks. The action sequences are filmed to perfection just as they should and everything falls into place beautifully! I love spending 2 hours immersed in Scott's world almost to the point where I don't enjoy leaving, this master director remains the greatest director working today and if for nothing else I urge you to see this film for the direction.The acting is also astonishing in its breath and acts as the films shining point. Standout roles form veterans Russell Crowe and Cate Blanchett are to be expected but it's when actors surprise you with their portrayal of historic characters that talent emerges. This man Oscar Isaac who is relatively new to the scene pulls out a tremendous performance as Prince John. There's little to say that's wrong with the acting, I can bet my bottom dollar that this will be up for some awards come Oscar time.The attention to detail is extraordinary, from the dialogue and the storyline to the myriad elements in production design, as the filmmakers create a convincing, raw, unjust and dangerous world - England as it might have been almost 1,000 years ago. Its staggering to watch these setting in action, its breathtaking. Scott's authenticity is what makes it so stunning to behold, to the point where I'd be surprised if they hadn't invented a time machine to capture such wonderful moments on film.Verdict: Scott's version of the classic Robin Hood tale is a joy to watch, from the staggering authenticity to just how entertaining the prelude to the well known story can be. He has created, as far as I'm concerned, the greatest adaptation of the tale to date. Scale, spectacle and heart make Ridley Scott's Robin Hood a heart-pumping and wonderful tale. I cannot stress enough the sheer amount of entertainment I get from Scott's world. Destined to takes its place besides Ridley Scott's other classic as one of his best films date.",Robin Hood

Cate Blanchett was amazing, Russel however did not perform to the best of his abilities and i'm sure he had some mild Irish accent when he is meant to be English...how does that work? anyways he had a funny accent, but still these two were great and without them this film would have been very boring! I like the fact Ridley Scott made Robin Hood more realistic than legend however it did mean that you are told politics etc. of England which i found boring. There wasn't much character development, the storyline of Marian and robin (the little that was shown) was the best because it was character focused, the rest was history focused. Also there were a few sexual references which i didn't expect from this film which i didn't approve of.

Although I'm usually a fan of Ridley Scott's work, this one is just an unfortunate misfire—I wonder whether he has forgotten how to tell a story. The numerous villains in this story are poorly developed (as are just about all of the supporting characters), the plot—which wanders aimlessly—is unnecessarily complicated by irrelevant subplots and revisions to the standard Robin Hood tale, and the whole thing devolves into a boring, pathetic mess.

Those Royal Marine LCPs (no vehicles of course –- except for horses) were more than marginally ahead of their time, and the battle tactics at the non-existent cliffs of Dungeness, which is pancake flat, and a godforsaken sort of place at the ends of the earth, were jaw-dropping. After the less than fluent traitor Godfrey took Crowe's arrow in the neck the plot went haywire. I didn't actually see the French king surrendering to Crowe, like somebody said, but there you go.There were a number of interesting parts, however, so a few comments: Max von Sydow. Since The Seventh Seal, 1957, where he played a Swedish Crusader knight returning home after ten years (standard service period), von Sydow, born 1929, has lent lustre to every film I've seen him in, although some of those films have been trashy. He certainly adds a touch of class here. Ridley seems to be acknowledging that Max is a Scanian, born in Lund, the original homeland, first of the Anglo-Saxons and then of the Vikings; in fact the womb of all nations of any virtue and merit. Indomitable salt of the earth, then and now. He comes across as a staunch and ruggedly noble Anglo-Saxon, and his traditionally pre-Christian funeral pyre is a nice touch.Cate Blanchett. Cate, born 1969, is just great as Lady Locksley (preferred spelling). She was born in Ivanhoe, Melbourne, Victoria, hence (perhaps) the Scott connection. Ebert has a point when he notes that ""Blanchett plays the role with great class and breeding"". Although he disapproves of this. Ridley certainly has an eye for the nuances of English class distinction, but it's arguable that there's something too mid-20th century in the tone of Cate's diction. So what, with those Moby DUKWs in the offing.Russell Crowe. Born 1964, he seemed older in this role. He looked tired much of the time, and sometimes overweight. Cate obviously thought he was dog-tired. At his excellent best in Master & Commander, and Cinderella Man, Crowe probably found those parts took a lot out of him. Soaking up all that punching; and it's a hard life at sea. Gladiator was not a good film, quite silly in fact, but it was very successful, and it looks as though Ridley and Russell were banking on repeating its sales figures. Not a wise objective, relying on the rotten bad taste of the fickle public.Sorry, Ridley, I've come to a decision. You've got it all back to front, mate: upside down! Your Robin Longstride is not the real Robin Hood at all, but a mythical and fictitious fake --- an impostor! You should have paid more attention to your kinsman, Sir Walter. The real Robin Hood was either Douglas Fairbanks or Errol Flynn --- most probably Flynn. All that podgy Longface has in common with the real, true, shaft-scorching Robin are his antipodean origins. The real Robin Hood always rode through the greenwood, dressed in Lincoln Green, with his merry band of men, shooting deer and sheriffs, splitting arrows, trouncing dastards with his trusty blade. Scouting ahead was nobody's fool, the well-employed Jester, with the brew that is true; and by his side was the glorious Maid Marian de Havilland, in brilliant sun-drenched colour.I've seen three timeless masterpieces by Ridley Scott: The Duellists, Black Hawk Down and Blade Runner. Robin Longstride is not in their league, but worth slightly more than 6.8. Much better than the ghastly Lion in Winter, of course.",Robin Hood
196,changmoh,Promising Start To New Robin Hood Adventure,7,9 May 2010,"Forget everything you know about Robin Hood and his Merry Men of Sherwood Forest. Wipe away images of those Men In Tights robbing the rich and helping the poor, the pretty damsel Maid Marion, Little John and the dastardly Sheriff of Nottingham. The legend of Robin the Hood gets an overhaul by Ridley Scott and writer Brian Helgeland - and you can hardly recognise the bones of the legend until you get to the end of the movie.Like ""The Dark Knight"", ""Iron Man"" and others, this is another origin movie that sees director Scott teaming up again with Russell Crowe 10 years after Gladiator! Helgeland's tale deals with the adventures of Robin Longstride (Crowe), an archer in the Crusading army of Richard the Lionheart, long before he is known to all and sundry as Robin Hood. During a battle against the French, Robin learns of the 'death' of King Richard and sees it as an opportunity to flee from the army. On his way back to England, he chances upon the critically injured Sir Robert of Loxley (Douglas Hodge) and promises the dying knight that he will take a sword back to his father, Sir Walter Loxley (Max Von Sydow).At Sir Walter's home near Nottingham, Robin meets Robert's faithful widow Marion (Cate Blanchett) and accepts Sir Walter's proposal to masquerade as Robert, his 'prodigal son'. This means getting involved with the Loxleys' problems like over-taxation by the town's sheriff (Matthew Macfadyen) and helping to protect them from pillaging attacks by King John's emissary Godfrey (Mark Strong.Early reports about the script suggested that Robin Hood was supposed to be a villain and the Sheriff of Nottingham the hero. This proved to be false because Scott seeks to be faithful to English history in this re-imagining of the folklore (mostly told in ballads). Indeed, Scott spends a lot of time on the political intrigues of King John's (Oscar Isaac) court involving Godfrey, William Marshall (William Hurt) and the Queen, painting a realistic and vibrant portrait of 12th Century England. In fact some of the scenes remind me of the TV series, ""The Tudors"", which had a handful of the same co-stars and extras. And that beach landing sequence is definitely reminiscent of the World War Two landings at Normandy!Anyway, with Crowe and Blanchett in the lead, we can always expect powerful performances and rousing scenes of battles and romance. Even though Blanchett's Marion is no maiden, it is easy to root for her because she is as feisty as she is attractive and very handy with a bow and arrow. As for Crowe, it is easy to dismiss his performance as Gladiator Maximus in tights but that may not be accurate. What I would have wished for was for more humour than those provided by Mark Addy's Frair Tuck and Scott Grimes' Will Scarlet. Still, we can look forward to more adventures of the famous archer in the sequels. - By LIM CHANG MOH (limchangmoh.blogspot.com)",Robin Hood

198,dschlatter,an easy 9,9,14 May 2010,"thank you, ridley scott, for making a movie that doesn't try to be bigger,better and more expensive than last years summer hits. i'm really getting tired of the whole fx-overkill (i'm so not going to watch 'prince of persia'), so again thanks!everything in this movie just comes naturally. the action appears violent, without ever really showing any blood. the funny moments just happen and not in a ha-ha-audience-please-laugh-now way. and the story flows from beginning to end, without ever dragging. yes, some elements remain underdeveloped (those kids in the forest. the leader with the mask on? what's going on there? we don't know)and the final battle is won before it even starts, so, no real suspense there.but guys, it exactly that quality that makes the movie great. it leaves the audience wanting more, instead giving them an overdose of action, drama or humor.perfect! i wish there were more movies like this, but the likes of clash of the titans, prince of persia, avatar (!!)proove that 'to much' is apparently the way to go.. pity!",Robin Hood
199,csrothwec,Errol Flynn's place as 'Number One movie Robin' still safe,7,7 June 2010,"The good news: great production values which make the film a visual feast (especially in the big set pieces, such as the castle siege at the beginning and the invasion at the end); Cate Blanchett's acting (superb as usual); Russell Crowe doing a sound job in the lead role and good support from other cast members as well. As for the rest, I think it suffers from Scott's search to be 'authentic' (which is a chase going nowhere as 'Hood' is an amalgam of myths, legends, folk tales etc. etc. with the 'King Richard' connection being no older than the early 19th century) and, in particular, to give Hood pretensions 'above his station'. The whole King John/Charter/'Let's try democracy' thing is just tiring and long-winded. (Errol Flynn's speech under the oak tree (lasting, what, two minutes?) said the whole thing much more effectively (and even convincingly!)) There is also some really cheesy dialog in there as well (King John: ""Shall we give every man a castle?"" / Robin: ""For an English man, his home is his castle!"" (Groan!))Conclusion: Good, solid fare, but I cannot imagine people wanting to re- run this one in the way one does even the Kevin Costner/Morgan Freeman version again and again and the envisaged sequel will need a different approach, not least with some real HUMOUR (and not just Tuck and his bees) mixed in to counter-act the po-faced memories this one leaves you with.",Robin Hood

Robin's ""Merry Men"" weren't very merry and I could never figure out if there was supposed to be chemistry between Crowe and Blanchette. There wasn't. I chose the director's cut from the DVD I rented. Each time I had to pause for some reason didn't matter much. The Eleanor of Acquataine character as well as King John were boring as well. I would not have enjoyed this in the theater as there was simply not enough to it. Sean Connery's version is a little better but not much. Stick with Braveheart.

201,rotildao,The Best Version Ever!!!,8,3 June 2010,"The human mind is something tricky. Without memory or at least some thinking we tend nowadays to shout our lungs out to be heard, seen, and touched in some way, however, effortless, we shout without listening to our own scream.This is the best version of Robin Hood. Taken away all the romanticism as much as possible we are left with the new age of revelation. To prove it, first, we can cite movies like Batman Begins and Dark Knight, which are psychologically charged in Maquiavellic ways such as works like V for Vendetta and Watchmen by Alan Moore. So I should correct myself stating that this is not just a new age of revelation, it is actually Alan Moore's Era. Whoever watched The Mindscape of Alan Moore will agree, this is the time where the ignorant can no longer survive unless he becomes aware of the real world and take it into his own hands, and hopefully not leave it adrift.In the film there are some points that could been explored differently, however, if one compares all the previous works adapted to screen of the tales of Robin Hood, or Batman, one could realize the similarities with the evolution of the ignorant, or the wanderer, I should say, which is the majority of the public, including myself in some ways.The bad things in the film are the dialogs between Robin and Marian. The best ones are done by Von Sidow. And Crowe, despite the Irish accent, does one single appearance in the screen when he recalls his Gladiator character and tells the King what a King really is, and coming from an Australian to an English King, I say: good job Russel! The camera work is superb, the editing is perfect, the script holds the film's balance, and it never jeopardizes the main result.The reason why this film is somewhat underrated here at IMDb is because the main audiences expected Gladiator 2, sorry, this is the same director, actor, etc, except it comes with an upgrade: Robin Hood is not Spartacus, nor Braveheart, somewhat it has a life of its own.My vote is 7.9 (8)",Robin Hood
202,Reel_starz,A satisfying yet uneven edition to the long history of Robin Hood,5,16 May 2010,"When Ridley Scott announced he would attempt a 'retelling' of the classic Robin Hood tale, he was met with a mixture of skepticism and hope. Ever since the black-and-white Douglas Fairbanks version in 1922, Robin Hood has been constantly remade, yielding few worthy results with the possible exception of Errol Flynn's frivolous, swashbuckling ""The Adventures of Robin Hood"" in 1938, which is commonly regarded as the classic version. However, all of these remakes treated the centuries-old story as light and comedic, whether intentionally or not, and by the beginning of the 2000s, Robin Hood had evolved into a sort of joke, as evidenced by Mel Brooks's 1993 spoof, ""Robin Hood: Men in Tights"". So it seemed fitting that this newest version, the first ever to put a truly serious spin on Robin Hood, would be from the duo who worked magic in 2000's Best Picture winner, ""Gladiator"". In the end, Scott's version has its merits, but given the lofty expectations, it is not entirely successful.Undeniably, the film's best element is the ingenious and long-delayed pairing of fellow Aussies Russell Crowe and Cate Blanchett, both almost universally acknowledged as two of the best actors of their, or of any, generation. Taking into account their lofty status in the film industry, it is a wonder that, if not for an unprecedented twist of events, this pairing might not have taken place (Sienna Miller was initially tapped to play Maid Marian but dropped out due to unspecified reasons); after viewing the film as it is, it is impossible to imagine anyone else in their roles. Their romantic chemistry does not so much sizzle as simmer, an intoxicating yet subtle tension that exudes from each glance and word exchanged, filling their scenes with spirit and energy. Separately, they imbue Robin Hood and Maid Marian, respectively, with depth and life, turning what could have been two-dimensional archetypes into fully believable individuals, but it is when they share the screen that they really shine.The rest of the cast is merely passable. As Prince John, Oscar Issac does his best, but he lacks the screen presence needed to make his character a truly menacing villain. In that department, Mark Strong, who plays the devious Godfrey, is more victorious, yet, like many of the other supporting actors, the script does not give him enough to work with and his character is only partially developed. Although the cast is made up of several well-known actors, including Danny Houston, William Hurt and Max von Sydow, they are mostly wasted in unimpressive roles, some of which feel superfluous. One of the reasons ""Robin Hood"" does not work as well as it should is that there are so many characters who have little purpose in the story and ultimately serve only to steal screen-time from the central characters. For the most part, when Russell Crowe and Cate Blanchett are not on screen, the movie sags.Similarly, the plot as a whole is interesting but needlessly convoluted and overly ambitious. In addition to the main story, which follows Robin Hood's journey to Nottingham and romance with Maid Marian, there are bits involving Prince John's mother, his wife, Eleanor of Aquitaine, a French invasion aided by Mark Strong's Godfrey, and Robin Hood's father, who died when Robin was a child. As a result, few of these subplots are adequately developed and the overall story becomes rather confusing. One gets the impression that vital scenes were cut out (though the movie still boasts a two-and-a-half hour-long running time) or that the film-makers were already preparing for a potential sequel. In addition, a few aspects of the plot, such as Prince John's burning of the Magna Carta-like document forced upon him by Robin Hood and other discontented peasants or Godfrey's destruction of multiple villages, threaten to stretch credibility.The movie's technical aspects are, naturally, awe-inspiring. There are numerous breathtaking shots of the sweeping English countryside or the tumultuous sea; in particular, there is a spectacular sequence showing the English army, led by King John, Robin Hood and Hurt's William Marshall, riding out to meet the French invaders in a set up for the film's climatic battle. The cinematography gives ""Robin Hood"" a genuinely epic aura and the costumes and sets are ridiculously detailed and authentic. Unlike many films, this one does not shy away from revealing the grittier, less appealing sides of medieval life, though at times, the stunning landscapes captured by Ridley Scott seem more akin to something from Middle Earth than Great Britain.Ultimately, ""Robin Hood"" is a noble effort that does not fully live up to its potential. Neither as engaging as ""Gladiator"" nor as historically fascinating as ""Kingdom of Heaven"", it represents a minor addition to Ridley Scott's impressive resume, and it does not lend its legendary subject the vivacity many might have hoped for. Nonetheless, ""Robin Hood"" is worth seeing, if only to gape at the magnificent visuals and to admire the fiery chemistry between the always-reliable Russell Crowe and Cate Blanchett.",Robin Hood

And this film is absolutely in the same style, but I didn't mind.I admit I was a bit sceptic to Russell Crowe as the title character, but he worked. I'm not a fan of Cate Blanchett but she didn't bother me here. The one who really stole the show was Oscar Isaac, great as king John. The action is great as expected but not quite so violent as Gladiator. The story is good, not very deep but neither predictable. It is a bit slow at times mostly in the middle but even if it is well over 2h I was always at attention.One should see this with a open mind and experience a entertaining and different take on a classic hero. 6/10For those who have seen it, will there be a sequel?

205,Targe,An otherwise solid medieval romp spoiled by muddled writing,7,4 October 2010,"This is a LONG (2 1/2 hours) ambitious medieval war movie with lots of great costumes, battles, characters, with very little resemblance to anything remotely accurate in history (most amusing are the French world war 2 landing craft made out of wood to make them 'medieval').When this movie succeeds, it does so brilliantly, with amusing scenes, witty dialogue, intense battle action sequences, gorgeous costumes.When this movie fails, it does so brilliantly as well, with a muddled plot I was squinting to follow, with Robin Hood somehow now responsible for the attempted introduction of the Magna Carta (forerunner of democracy) in England, foiling a French invasion while fighting beside the king, and playing with Peter Pan-esquire Lost Boys in the woods.Using Cate Blanchett as the fabled and gorgeous maid marion was a disappointment to me as well. I'm sorry but Cate just doesn't do it for me any more, and she plays such a stiff English woman it's difficult to sense any attraction at all between Crow and her in the movie. I suspect they hated each other on set, no chemistry WHATSOEVER.Also disappointing is the failure to develop the Robin Hood team to any great degree. They have 2 1/2 hours, and we don't even get to see Friar Tuck whip some ass with a quarterstaff?? When they do put the team together the movie suddenly becomes magic, as the clear friendship between Crow and Great Big Sea frontman Doyle is apparent. But listening to a medieval gang launch into a Great Big Sea dirge in the belly of a medieval sailing ship was - well, WEIRD... to say the least.The contrived evil villain of Mark Strong is also bizarre. He's working for an evil king, he get's made his right hand man... AND THAT'S NOT GOOD ENOUGH. Oh no, he'd rather work for the French king and try to pull off some crazy invasion of England instead... wtf??? I found his character very weak and unconvincing and illogical as all get out. Max Von Sydow saves some of the day with a solid and convincing run as the old blind land baron who likes his wine. It would have been nice to see him kick some better butt against Strong though. Just because your blind doesn't mean you flail around like a rag doll, the old warrior would have kept his balance and skill, so that part was poorly done.Finally, it was depressing to sit through 2 1/2 hours only to learn that the real story of Robin Hood was now only just beginning at the END OF THE MOVIE.

Scott and Crowe are back. 10 years fresh from the Oscar magnetised Gladiator, this time round they've gone 13th century and have given Hood a meaner, greener but not leaner look. Add a husky voice, occasionally funny followers and a evil-looking villain (played by Mark Strong - who was in Kick-Ass, therefore I respect him) and you have the 3 billionth interpretation of this legendary tale.After the death of King Richard, Robin sets off to England and unfortunately this is where things start to get a bit dull. Inglourious Basterds kept the high level of conversations at an impeccable level of brilliance, whereas here, well it doesn't succumb anything past mediocrity. Making you start to forget why such a memorable hero was such a big deal in the first place.Still Cate Blancett, Russell Crowe and the giggling people sitting behind me who even found three topless men funny, all made this move at a reasonable enough pace to still find watchable.But I still won't be buying the DVD unless I am suffering some major form of hyperactivity as it is the type of experience that will be enjoyed if you really feel patient enough to watch it again or have such low expectations that you actually quite enjoy it.",Robin Hood

It's drowning in a sea of characters, none of whom get enough screen time to be fleshed out, or even give one the ability to tell them apart.

210,puttputtk,Great re-imagining.,9,14 May 2010,"5 word summary Archer defends England from FranceThough it is in some aspects a prequel, at the same time it's a re-imagining of the legend of Robin Hood. It helps explain the known legend a little but there are some things that wouldn't line up. In my opinion that's a good thing. Many people, like Ebert, are attacking the movie for being original and not following the legend, but seriously, do we need the exact same story told over and over again? I don't think so, it is necessary sometimes to change up a story, to keep it interesting. I'm not saying anything bad about the original story, cause I really do enjoy it, just saying maybe this is the reason people are seemingly afraid to create new stories. It seems every movie now is the same as the last, remakes and sequels, and even though this one was a ""remake"" sort-a-speak it still had the balls to me original, and for that I applaud it. To the film itself now.Easily some of the best fight scenes in a long time. very well directed (though a little too heavy on the slow mo), and actually from some of the reviews (like eberts) I expected much more fight scenes, but it was actually pretty minimal and were needed for the story. Overall it was well written, as I said good balance in fight scenes, not too many, also the love story didn't take over as much as I thought it was going to, which is also a good thing. And the dialog was well written as well. Directing was very good, maybe not Oscar worthy but nomination worthy as of now. Russell Crowes performance was good, but nothing special for him. Same with Cate Blanchette, I could see her getting a nomination because she is always spectacular, but it wasn't outstanding for her. The true stand out performances come from William Hurt and Mark Strong, I could see either of them getting a best supporting actor nomination from one of the award shows. The best part of the film however is the cinematography, which is definitely Oscar worthy, or at least nomination worthy, very beautiful pictures.Overall definitely worth seeing, for most people. Id say the best way of gauging if you would like it is to watch Gladiator, if you like that you should like this, and if you are not a fan id stay away from robin hood, very similar with the drama with some action mixed in.",Robin Hood

212,MarcusJ13,Very enjoyable,8,30 May 2010,"The term remake or reboot or whatever it is its called is thrown around quite a lot. Its inevitable that ideas get recycled and new people come along to tackle something already been done. Sometimes it works sometimes it doesn't, but in Robin Hood I think it worked very well. It was probably inevitable that we'd get another version of Robin Hood but thankfully this one is very enjoyable. Onto the director now and Ridley Scott is an excellent director I mean Alien, Blade Runner, Gladiator all great films with a terrific epic (or creepy in the case of Alien) feel to them that some directors can't really fathom. In this we have Russell Crowe playing our bow and arrow hero who gives a really good portrayal in all honesty. I do think his accent went a bit off at times when he sort of swayed into generic the 'Gladiator' type voice. That said he was convincing for the most part and I can't imagine many actors who would have played it as well as him. The battle scenes were outstanding and a joy to behold on the big screen, all of them were well shot and executed superbly (I think this is attributed a great deal to the directing). I'd recommend it for the realistic battle scenes alone as I've said should be seen on the big screen or at least in HD on a big television. The film does get a tad slow towards the middle and tries to explain things a little too much in my view but it doesn't detract from the good acting on show. Another thing I have to mention is the cinematography, it was some of the best I've seen in a film and even for someone who may not like the film I still think they could appreciate it as it was one of the best looking films I've seen in a long time. All in all even if all you're looking for a good action film then you can't go wrong here as all the action is brilliant. If you're looking for something that is say as epic as Gladiator then you won't find it here but it is still well worth a look.",Robin Hood

While it may not be as bloody as Kingdom of Heaven, the action still remains exciting and brutal. People who have not seen that film will be disappointed by the lack of action and scenes that are too long.While I found the film to be exciting, I couldn't help but realise that this would have been great if it was a 15 (UK age certificate) rather than a 12a. The first action sequence is great as English soldiers attack a French castle but it felt restricted that you would never see any blood when someone is killed; a soldier is shot in the neck by an arrow but other than the arrow, they look completely fine. Early on a character dies but from the way it was edited, you would never have known. A film where the violence is as savage and as brutal as this, requires you to feel as if the characters are in great danger.A lot has been said about Russell Crowe and his acting in the film but I found little to complain about. He suited his role well. The supporting cast including Mark Strong, Cate Blanchett, Max von Sydow, William Hurt, Kevin Durand and Oscar Isaac are fantastic. They are all completely immersed into their roles. I never felt that someone else could have been casted instead. The cinematography is also really good but if only it was not let down by the editing. As a sword or axe is flung towards an enemies head, it cuts straight after the impact, loosing a sense of realism.

There were Arabic subtitles but I had to suffer through the movie not understanding quite a bit of the dialogue.When the movie ended absolutely everyone in the large cinema was very disappointed. Everyone! Since I was the only customer anyway my opinion ruled.What a mess this was. Now my strong feeling is the a tale like Robin Hood should be shown in a fairly constricted fashion so that it is true to the fantasy we have all heard and read about. Imagine what Lord of the Rings would have been like if Jackson had ignored the fantasy written by Tolkien? I shudder to think of that.The real movie about Robin Hood that agreed with our preconceptions began about 90 seconds from the end of this movie. I remember something Crowe had said about this movie in that he thought it should be reinterpreted, and he had mentioned the Errol Flynn 1938 movie as being formulaic, while this version would not be. Well, not only was it not so but it did not tell us anything about the Robin Hood we all know at all. The 1938 movie was way above this misery, and the English 1950s version was also miles ahead of this.I do not understand how a very accomplished director and good writer could fall into this mess. What were they thinking of? Probably not thinking at all I should not wonder. Other reviewers have pointed out all of the errors and nonsense in the film but I will repeat just one here. I recall thinking as I watched the French boats approaching the shore that, surely, even though they look like WWII landing craft they could not be and the front part just looks like it would fold down, but surely would not. But of course they did. Did a bunch of idiots miss this stupid story requirement? Well, at least I was in air-conditioned comfort in a very comfortable reclining seat when it was 109 degrees outside. It was so comfortable I almost feel asleep in the middle of the film. Why was this called Robin Hood anyway? I saw Friar Tuck but maybe I was asleep when he and Robin alternately carried each other across the stream. It should have been called something else entirely.My advice is not to waste your money either going to see this or renting it. Also, if there is a sequel don't bother with that.",Robin Hood
216,randreww,Robin WHO?,2,1 January 2015,"I was susceptible to this cast & to this remake. But the curse of post 2000 film making taints this film in every way you'd expect. The duration of this film is long yes, but that is not what protracts it. The dialog is what makes it drag, & the pace it sets. There seems to be some kind of fear amongst film makers now which ties them to a formula of 'how a film has to be directed'. And Ridley Scott is no exception. In fact, he is soon becoming the George Lucas of directors. The plot is overly complex, the script is convoluted, & the characters clandestine. One of them had to have a bald head because I suspect he wouldn't have been distinguished otherwise! It's impossible not to compare this to it's predecessor with Kevin Costner & Alan Rickman which was full of witty dialog, action which follows through; progressing the plot, & bright colours. Now? Now all the colour is sucked out of shots, heavily saturated, the frame rate is lowered, the edits are frantic, then you have the ""shaky camera syndrome"", the constant switch of shots (low-angle, upper, wide angle, Arial, static, moving, etc.) so all style & thus grip on the reality of the story is lost. The Battle sequences are more dull than the repore amongst the characters, which you'd think is impossible at first, considering you barely get any character development beyond the odd quip or platitude. But you soon begin to realise what is really wrong with this film. The story. Everyone knows the tale of Robin Hood, or at least the most fundamental parts. It is quintessential to protect this figure; people need heroes, villains & solutions to unbearable morasses. Everything about this film has you scratching your head as to why they would go against the principles & origins of the age-old tale. There is so much to like about it! But they seem to avoid it all. And what's more frustrating is that when an interesting event has to be addressed, it is done with élan & little to no enthusiasm. ""I could teach you how to tie knots. I could teach you which wood to get to make your bows stronger. I could teach you how to make arrows that fly more than 20 feet. And I can help Marion to teach you how to stay clean so you won't get sick."" Key word: ""Could"". This film could have been a classic. But instead, it's just another modern remake which shall age fast amongst an endless sea of failures. By the time you're watching the end battle sequence, you will have given up on this palsied parody of a beloved tale. It's shocking but not surprising that even the ITV series ""Robin of Sherwood"" echoes it's faint inimitable triumph with lines like ""If I say you're a serf then you're a serf"" after this painful watch. But if you remake a film avoiding all good ideas done before.. what can you expect?",Robin Hood
217,MosHr,Solid but nothing really special,6,11 May 2010,"This isn't the Robin Hood we know; it's Gladiator mixed with Bravehart kind of Robin Hood. Like every other British historical epic, it involves the royal family who do their throne heir thing, fighting against the French and the wonderful peasant life with a proper knight in charge. I'm sure they are important topics but the movie presents them in the same exact feel that has been done to death in other movies and on TV. This movie just feels like a TV episode rather than a movie.Well, the only way to really tell that it's a big budget movie is because of the battles. However, the battles looks like it was done by the same company that did Saving Private Ryan.Robin Hood is exactly like you'd expect a character in English history played by Russel Crowe to be; not the playful archer Robin Hood in green but a somber cerebral sword wielding, chain mail gray Robin WhatisHisName.

218,TourettesPersonal,A new Robin Hood,8,13 June 2010,"Robin Hood (2010) is a prequel. So this movie happens first before he steals money from the rich and give them to the poor. This is not the Robin Hood that we used to know but it's so entertaining and solid.This re-imagined version of Robin Hood is supposed to be realistic, and serious but there are some ridiculous moments in this movie that makes the movie less serious. Robin Hood is like Iron Man 2, The fun happens in the beginning and the end, and the middle is a little boring. The things that disappoints me are the action scenes and it doesn't feel like Robin Hood anymore.Ridley Scott's directing was great, The cinematography was good, the music score makes the action scenes more fun, Theaction scenes are entertaining. Russel Crowe is too old to play Robin Hood but his acting was good, So does Cate Blancette.

219,jjgooner,Never gets going,4,28 July 2013,"Robin Hood**(out of 4)140 mins/ 12Cast: Russell Crowe, Cate Blanchett, Max von Sydow, William Hurt, Mark Strong, Oscar Isaac, Danny Huston, Eileen Atkins, Mark Addy, Matthew Macfadyen, Kevin Durand, Scott Grimes, Alan Doyle, Douglas Hodge, Lea Seydoux, Mark Lewis Jones, Simon McBurneyDirector: Ridley ScottPlot: Robin Longstride, disguised as Sir Robert Loxley, leads a rebellion against bad King John. JJ's Verdict: As a massive fan of the story itself, the recent BBC TV series and all the film versions, I really wanted to like Ridley Scott's Robin Hood. With its superb cast and seriousness, I really thought we were finally going to get the definitive version of Robin Hood. However, the film tries to put the famous myth into actual British history, which is where this film ultimately fails (along with plenty of other stuff too).This adaptation of the 'Hood' is an origin story, telling us how he became the arrow-firing outlaw he is known as today. After returning from the Crusades with the crown of the dead King Richard, Robin Longstride travels to Nottingham under the name of Sir Robert of Loxley, a knight who died by Robin's side. Under heavy pursuit by the evil Sir Godfrey, who is in league with the French, Robin takes refuge at the house of Lady Marion Loxley and Sir Walter Loxley, an old friend of his father. Posing as Marion's late husband, he leads the local men of Nottingham and its surrounding towns in an uprising against King John and Sir Godfrey. What will aggravate so many viewers is the film's decision to present the old myth of Robin Hood (the truth of which has been heavily debated) as fact and pt it behind the making of the Magna Carta and other historic events during the 12th century. If this was a fun or tongue-in-cheek version like those before, you could forgive it, but this film is so deadly serious that you feel it must be trying to say this is the truth – which is just stupid!It does, however, look real. The sets are wonderfully designed, as are the costumes, and the few battle scenes there are feel very realistic and are well choreographed. All of the accents are British (compared to other adaptations), even if they're not the correct regions. The acting itself is mainly very good. Russell Crowe brings a silent charm and charisma to Robin, if still keeping his Gladiator grittiness. The supporting cast is tremendous and the likes of Max von Sydow, William Hurt and Danny Huston all give brilliant turns in small but significant roles. The modern Hollywood go-to guy for villains, Mark Strong, is pure evil and British television actor Mark Addy is very funny as Friar Tuck. Cate Blanchett is the film's definite miscast. She does her best in an underwritten role, but she comes across too bossy and masculine to come across as your typical Marion. Some may think it is a good twist, but I'm fed up with characters like hers being depicted as being more skilled in sword fighting than men, when in reality the chances are very slim. Not only does it have the no-nonsense heroine cliché, but every tired and overused action and war film cliché ever written with stuff like every single character getting involved in the finale, despite in reality, would never be able to hold a sword the right way round let alone kill people with it, and two people kissing in the middle of a battlefield while everyone beside you is still fighting for their lives. As if the cliché's weren't tiring enough, this film wins my awards for both 'slowest film of the year' and 'film that only gets going in the final ten minutes of the year.' And that sums up why this film, ultimately fails. Despite being historically bad, if Ridely Scott had made this a fun and entertaining swashbuckler I wouldn't be complaining. But every scene is so long and fails to hold your attention. The pacing is all over the place and when you think it is finally going to start to pick up the pace, it slows even further downIt does come in for a wonderful final battle scene, but Robin Hood is a clichéd and inaccurate bore. Robin Hood? More like Robin' you off two and a half hours of your life.",Robin Hood
220,picturetaker,The curse of Robin Hood,2,22 March 2013,"What is it with the story of Robin Hood that it can never be told right in film and that the lead actor can never seem to be the right actor for the part. This movie is another fine example of the on going curse of Robin Hood in cinema.I remember when I was a kid and Robin Hood: Prince of Thieves came out. Then a few years later Men in tights came out. Out of these three movies Men in tights was probably the best one as it was a satire and not meant to be taken serious. Yet this one, is supposed to be the best as Ridley Scott directed it! Yes that guy! The guy who did other movies such as Alien, Gladiator, Kingdom of Heaven and that crazy apple commercial from the 1980's. So how oh how did this one get so bad? First of all Russell Crowe was cast in this movie as Robin Hood. He just seemed too old for the part. I think that Orlando Bloom or Christian Bale (both Englishmen) would have been faaaaaaaaar better as Robin Hood in this movie. Russell Crowe would have been better as Godfrey because rarely do we see Russell Crowe play the bad guy. So the casting was simply way off.Then there is the story. Magna carta should have been left out. Besides that I don't know really what to say except I essentially felt as if I watched a counterfeit version of Gladiator and Braveheart. It's too bad because we'll have to wait another 20 years before some director attempts Robin Hood again.The movie is entertaining. But do yourself a favour and just watch Braveheart or Gladiator because when it's over you'll feel like you didn't waste your life doing so.",Robin Hood

222,Foux_du_Fafa,Boring and misses the point of the actual legend,2,18 January 2011,"When I saw ""Robin Hood"" in the cinema during the summer, I started eagerly scouting for the dots in the corner of the screen that signify the changing of film reels. That's how bored I was with the film.Now, I'll add that I'm a fan of the Robin Hood legend. Equally, I appreciate Ridley Scott greatly, and think that some of his films are fantastic. I also appreciated the visual beauty of the film itself, and the fact that it showed Robin's world as plague-ridden Medieval Europe was probably more engaging than the usual nostalgic vision as seen in, say, the Errol Flynn film. So I kept asking myself: how could this film end up being so bad? It's easily one of the dullest and most uninteresting films I have ever seen in my life.Part of me wants to give Russell Crowe the blame. I'm not exactly a fan of him to start, but here he gives Robin around ten different regional accents from across the British Isles over the course of the film, which is certainly distracting. I can't see how anyone would let that slip, especially in such a big budget production in this day and age, and it hardly does much to promote Crowe as an actor. But even then, a mishap with the main character's voice shouldn't excuse his overwhelmingly dull characterisation, a practical cypher with zero charisma.Nor should it excuse the boringness of the other characters or the lack of an engaging plot, which is a rambling story of royal intrigue and deception set around the time of the Magna Carta's signing and continued bad relations between the medieval kingdoms of France and England (in truth, the film is a sort of prequel, sort of loose adaptation). What makes the traditional Robin Hood story so great is that, like all the great legends, fairy tales and myths, it speaks to raw human emotions, and doesn't need to be made into a deep discourse on medieval politics. The original legend has always been undeniably simple, but it was an engaging story of human liberty and wealth, and of the sacrifices some make to help the less fortunate and to vanquish the oppressors.Call me a primal simpleton, but what made every other major production of the story so effective, from Errol Flynn's 1938 film to Disney's animated farce, was that it didn't deny itself as being much more than a simplistic story of the struggle between good and evil in a corrupt society. By letting it follow Hollywood's in-vogue trend of ""deconstructing, reconstructing and re-imagining"" classics without totally considering the spirit of the original, and by trying to make the characters ""grey"" (though ultimately not sharply developed), the film basically becomes not much more than a cold yarn of royal intrigue and confusion among nobility, undeniably missing the point of the original legend and what made it so winning, or any other traditional story for that matter. As such, the film is a complete disappointment.",Robin Hood
223,cpbadgeman,Many wrongs to be righted in the film of Robin Hood,6,24 May 2010,"This film was a big disappointment. It had the potential to be fantastic but falls to pieces well before the end. All the ingredients for greatness were present: a beloved legend for source material, Russell Crowe as the leading man (nuff said), director Ridley Scott (whose previous medieval epic ""Kingdom of Heaven"" was amazing), and the fact that when these two collaborated on ""Gladiator"" they created a modern classic.Things do get off to an excellent start. The first third of the film (set in France) is absolutely cracking, the siege of a French castle being particularly well-depicted. However, once the action switches to England the film gets bogged down by too many plot strands. In case you were wondering, there is NO time devoted to Robin and his Merry men slugging it out with the Sheriff of Nottingham in Sherwood Forest. That is what I had been expecting and it just doesn't happen at all. The film's biggest and most unforgivable failure is that the actual legend of Robin Hood is totally eclipsed by what ought to be side-plots. We do see how Robin gets from France to Nottingham, then there is a separate storyline about maid Marion, a third about intrigue at the court of King John, a fourth about the creation of an unnamed document that is obviously the Magna Carta, and a fifth about a full-scale French invasion. This overcomplicated narrative collapses under it's own weight and the later battle scenes (which are well done)seem curiously abbreviated in order to give enough screen time to each separate thread. On the plus side the battle scenes are rousing (though the ones earlier in the film are better-paced and staged), the acting is decent, and look of the film is knockout (particularly a depiction of 12th century London). The soundtrack is good too. What is most frustrating about ""Robin Hood"" is that there are several potentially excellent films contained in the script but a massive lack of narrative discipline results in a finished product that is a mediocre muddle. Wait for the DVD.",Robin Hood
224,maatmouse-1,Russell's medieval followup to Gladiator,7,16 June 2010,"Much has been made of Ridley Scott and Russell Crowe's third collaboration together. There have been high expectations, certainly after Gladiator was released and Crowe got his Oscar. This film has had a difficult birth.It is fair to say this film IS about Robin Hood. There is very little known historically about Britain's most famous archer. Some might say he was a nobleman turned outlaw due to circumstances beyond his control and others believe he was simply an outlaw. It doesn't really matter. It is always good material for a reasonable story.The film starts off interesting enough with action and establishes Robin's place in the story. We learn he is not a noble man but a jobbing archer, like so many men at war in these particular times. We also learn he is no relation to Robin or Robert of Loxley. That comes later. We also learn he fought with Richard the Lionheart, played commendably but short-lived by Danny Huston. Lionheart dies by arrow wound and Robin and his men decide to leave the army in search of spoils and pay. They quickly run into trouble in the form of an envoy taking Richard's crown back to England and cross paths with the real troublemaker of the film: Sir Godfrey. It is here that Robin, known as Longstride until now, discovers Sir Robert Loxley and vows to tell his father about his son's death and return his sword to him. To do, Robin and his men practise subterfuge and 'become' nobles with all the trappings they find. The group sail back to England and right into trouble. Robin, who has now taken the identity of Loxley, returns the crown to Eleanor of Aquitaine, played brilliantly by Eileen Atkins, who gives it to her sullen and sulky son and his french wife. En route, Robin meets William Marshall who has no inkling of who he really is and briefly glimpses Sir Godfrey. At this point, things become complicated.It is at the half way point in the film that the history goes to the wall and Robin heads off to Nottingham, sword in hand. Over the next hour or so, we find Robin gaining the entry into the household of Loxley and gaining the trust and friendship of both Sir Walter and his daughter in law Marion, the wife of Robert Loxley. He briefly spars with Marion and learns more about the family he's been brought into. A lot is taken on trust here, something which a suspicious nobleman wouldn't have probably done. Meanwhile Godfrey is trying to bring the French over and divide the northern lands of England by sending his troops around, collecting taxes. By setting the northern barons against the Crown, Godfrey hopes that they will fight against him and make it easy for a french king to gain control. In the process of defending his adopted territory and new love, Robin briefly fights against Godfrey but in the process, somehow manages to become the outlaw of legend.It is fair to say that this film's history is all over the place and would have been much better had most of the plot about Loxley and politics been dumped over the side and trimmed down. A film detailing the conflict between Robin and his adopted town and the Sheriff of Nottingham, without any of the politicking which was dubious anyway, would have been much tidier. The outlaw's life was sketchy at best, why complicate it? That said, Scott's film is not a total mess. It looks about right. A nice touch of Kingdom of Heaven combined with the less clean approach to shooting medieval England. Most of the cast do a sterling job. Cate Blanchett works and looks the part, even lumbered with the terrible accent; Crowe is good as ever and nearly all the British end of the cast look and sound right, even if some of them could have been given more to do. Max Von Syndow is good as ever as is Eileen Atkins and William Hurt. This is a nicely cast film, although I hope Mark Strong will stop being offered bad guy roles as he's done enough of them.All in all, a good film if you don't look too closely at the historical anomalies.",Robin Hood
225,TheUnseenMovieLover,"An Entertaining, But Imperfect, Summer Flick",7,23 May 2010,"When I think of Robin Hood, I visualise a cheeky, righteous man who has fun stealing from the rich to give to the poor. For his version of Robin Hood, Ridley Scott has opted for a dark, gritty origin tale of how the man becomes the legend. The decision to put such a potentially fun character through this grim, Batman Begins-like tale is courageous, and the result's a pretty good piece of adult summer entertainment.1199. When Richard the Lionheart (Danny Huston) is killed during his crusade of France, the task to deliver the crown to his brother Prince John (Oscar Isaac) falls to Richard's right-hand man Robert Loxley (Douglas Hodge). Whilst on his way to London, Loxley is killed in an ambush set by the traitorous Sir Godfrey (Mark Strong), a friend of the prince who is conspiring with the French. The ambush is stopped by archer Robin Longstride (Russell Crowe) and his companions. Robin promises the dying Loxley that he will deliver his sword to his father, Walter (Max von Sydow) in Nottingham. After delivering the crown to the prince, Robin fulfils his promise. Walter suggests that Robin takes the identity of his son in order to protect his land after he has died. Whilst this at first angers Robert's wife Marian (Cate Blanchett), she and Robin slowly develop an affectionate relationship. Meanwhile, Godfrey plots to weaken King John's relationship with his people to pave the way for a French invasion.The movie takes its time setting up the political and historical context, which is probably its biggest flaw. It all comes together nicely at the film's conclusion, making the reasons for Robin becoming an outlaw more complex than you may first think. However, it makes the film feel bloated in the process. The storyline involving Robin's father is yet another case of story overload, as it amounts to very little and could have been ejected without much harm to the film overall. Also, Scott and writer Brian Helgeland make some questionable links between Robin and English history. Robin pretty much tells King John to create the Magna Carta.That being said, Robin Hood is a blockbuster worth seeing. This is mainly down to the epic action. From a stunning siege on a French castle to an attack on Nottingham by Godfrey and the concluding attempted French invasion which plays out like a medieval Saving Private Ryan, Ridley Scott shows that he knows how to craft an engaging action scene. The battle sequences are bloodless, but under the restrictions of a 12A rating, what else can you expect? The action packs enough of a visual wallop to satisfy.It's also fortunate that Robin Hood is still a feast for the eyes, even in its dullest moments; the period production design is spot-on, and you never accept this world as anything but utterly rich and real. The cinematography is beautifully organic, and the score by Marc Streitenfeld is wonderful. As far as technical credits go, Robin Hood doesn't disappoint.This film's strongest asset is its terrific cast. Scott and Helgeland wisely spend time developing the relationship between Robin and Marion, and it pays off immensely thanks to the fiery, dignified yet cheeky performances of Crowe and Blanchett. Blanchett, in particular, crackles with electricity, bringing both strength and vulnerability to her role as Marian. Marian isn't your typical damsel in distress, and Blsanchett is superb. Crowe, whilst struggling with his accent, is an ideal choice for a rugged, world weary yet still charming Robin. He brings true charisma and presence to the role.Mark Strong sinks his teeth into yet another villain. To tell you the truth, Strong is starting to be typecast as the bad guy (see also Stardust, Sherlock Holmes and Kick-Ass), but he is still imposing. Robin's Merry Men are played by Kevin Durand (Little John), Scott Grimes (Will Scarlet), Alan Doyle (Allan-a-Dale) and Mark Addy (Friar Tuck), all of whom are solid. Addy, in particular, was born to be Friar Tuck, and Crowe's real-life friendship with Durand, Grimes and Doyle makes their on screen relationship all the more believable. Matthew Macfadyen makes a powerful impact on the memory as Robin's most well-known enemy, the sneering and cowardly yet potentially dangerous Sheriff of Nottingham. Macfadyen is only in the film for about five minutes, but he milks those five minutes for all they're worth. William Hurt and Eileen Atkins bring strength and compassion to the characters of chancellor William Marshall and King John's mother Eleanor of Aquitaine respectively. Max von Sydow gives the most human performance as Walter Loxley; he combines the experience of a man of his age with the youthful liveliness of a 12-year-old boy. Walter's fate packs the film's most potent emotional punch. However, the film is stolen by Oscar Isaac as the jealous and greedy King John. Isaac is immensely entertaining in the role. He is campy without going over the top (unlike, say, Alan Rickman in 1991's Prince of Thieves), and shows just enough humanity to show that the threat that John poses is very real (there is a brilliant scene where John's wife (the luminous Léa Seydoux) confronts him about Godfrey's allegiance). This is a fantastic performance.Robin Hood is an entertaining time at the cinema. It's better than Prince of Thieves. I'm going to give a criticism that is unusual for most summer blockbusters; it's too smart for its own good. The overly complex plot bogs down what should have been a slimmer narrative, and the historical links don't always work. However, Scott knows how to shoot period action scenes like nobody else's business, and the action here is thrilling enough to give Robin Hood the kick it needs to satisfy the action fans. The strength of the acting, the gorgeous technical credits and the occasionally clever screenplay lift it up another level, to the point where I recommend it for two and a bit hours of solid summer fun.",Robin Hood
226,lleeric,Fell Asleep in the Theatres,2,16 June 2010,"I'm surprised by the performance of Academy Award Winners Ridly Scott, Cate Blanchett, and Russell Crowe. This movie is a disgrace to them. I have 3 reasons why this movie is bad. 1. Very boring 2. Has stuff that the watcher doesn't need to know about 3. A Disgrace. I got so flicked off at the end of the movie i just wanted to go up on the screen and tear it down. This movie felt like it was 5 hours long!!! I wasn't the only one asleep. I heard someone snoring in the front seat of me. It about a person who fights and becomes a hero and later his name turns in to Robin Hood. Come on actors/actresses try again! I'll give this a 2/10",Robin Hood
227,phantopp,Movie trailers were misleading,4,12 May 2011,"From what I saw in the trailers for this film, I was expecting a fast-paced action flick. Sadly, the movie is far from it.Following the death of ""King Richard the Lionhearted"" (Danny Huston) during the Crusades, ""Robin Longstride"" (Russell Crowe) and four men come upon the aftermath of an ambush, and find a dying British knight who tells ""Longstride"" of a plot between France and a British collaborator -- a British knight.""Longstride"" promises the dying knight that he will return the knight's sword to his father. But, when he returns to his homeland, he poses as the knight, and helps those in need.Based on centuries old legends from Great Britian, Robin Hood is far from the typical depictions we have seen over the years in popular media. In other depictions, including a popular BBC television series in 2006, ""Hood"" is either arriving from his journey home from the Holy Land or he has been back for some time, and already declared an outlaw. This movie is focused more on the events leading to the title character becoming the legendary ""Robin Hood"". But, unlike other depictions I've seen, this one is not a strong representation of the legendary outlaw.The first 75% of the film is unbearably slow I thought, and I noticed I was paying more attention to my computer (I watched it on HBO this afternoon) than the television. To me, the scenes between any fight scenes just lagged and had poor development for the characters.It appears that those behind the scenes relied on the audience already knowing the characters, and gave them little to no development. They introduced some new twists with the characters, which worked fairly well, but they were just not presented in an interesting way I thought.I felt little to no chemistry between the characters, especially between ""Marion"" (Cate Blanchett) and ""Longstride"". All the main players are there, but they were one-dimensional in my opinion. None of them stood out.One thing I noticed is that non-British actors had a terrible time with the British accent. Sometimes they sounded British, while other times, their accents sounded Irish or even Scottish. It was very obvious that the dialect coach hired to help the non-British cast members failed in his or her job. It got quite confusing at times when I heard the wrong accent.Probably because they were working with a well known story, the movie is pretty predictable. The actors in this movie failed at attempting to make their lines believable, which didn't get them out of the one-dimensional feel I was getting from them. The worse of the characters had to be ""King John"" (Oscar Isaac), who was absolutely horrible. Isaac's performance was uneven, and came off as trying to be comical when he most likely wasn't trying to be that way.Cinematorgraphy wasn't that great either, but was slightly better during wide angle scenes during battles. There were no bright colors in the scenery, nor wardrobe. It was a pretty bland looking movie, which went along with the bland performances.One thing you need to know is that this movie is fairly violent. I would not suggest this for a young audience that the Disney version of this story targets. You will see a lot of gruesome wounds like an arrow through a hand or chest. It looked as if they did a fair job at focusing at main cast members in close-up shots during large battles, but those close-ups were rushed and just did not work out if you ask me.If you are a fan of the legend, this is going to disappoint you. If you are new to the legend, I would suggest the superior BBC television series that ended about a year before this movie came out, and all three seasons of that version would be a better addition to your Netflix queue or your personal DVD/Blu-Ray collection. The BBC series has more interesting depictions of the main cast of characters, and is more family-friendly.",Robin Hood
228,dejan8378,It is not Gladiator,8,2 October 2010,"Gladiator was as much a blessing and a curse for Ridley Scott I feel. Every movie He makes is compared to that one and fails to be that good, and is evident that He likes to make epic stories with swords. Also I think He tries to even escape from Gladiator, so maybe that is why Robin Hood is less bloody, and has a less fighting scenes. But don't worry it has enough blood and fights for every fun of the genre. The story is completely different, more romantic, more humorous, more political and those things are done successfully.I definitely think that the man behind legend is presented excellent, which makes me wonder how the professional critics didn't saw that.

231,Arcturus1980,Flawed but enjoyable,7,24 December 2010,"I put this film in with Errol Flynn's superior The Adventures of Robin Hood (8/10) in mind. The film can't help but try and fail to echo the spirit of Braveheart. The first quarter or so is weak, but it gets better. There are some marvelous aerial shots. It is commendable to see the legendary Max von Sydow still getting up and punching. I like Cate Blanchett's character, who nearly drowns while engaging herself in a battle, a well-taken departure from the norm. The script, though not exactly dazzling the mind, is reasonably coherent. For me, the film doesn't defeat itself as a prequel.Beyond being enjoyable, Robin Hood further solidifies my conception of Russell Crowe as a man of integrity in a business short on it. Even in the case of a film I don't like (American Gangster, 5/10), it is nice to have some assurance that he hasn't signed on merely to pile millions on top of millions and/or to assuage a neurotic inability to look himself in the mirror.",Robin Hood

I love how the signing of the Magna Carta, even though it wasn't done in this movie, got to eventually get done.King John will not win any awards for being a great leader, but according to this movie at least, he did have a very hot wife.

I thought there was good enough balance between the story and the action and like others I feel this is a nice prequel before the real movies comes out later. I think we would all like to see much more of Robin's Merry Men who were all a bit two-dimensional in the movie. Marion and Robin had plenty of space for their characters to develop, and at the end of the movie I was feeling quite passionate that some enemies get their just rewards. All in all, a great movie.

239,wolverinesforever,Slight letdown; a review from a Ridley Scott fan,6,18 May 2010,"I was very excited when I heard that Russel Crowe and Ridley Scott were teaming up for this film. Seeing as they had done so well together in ""Gladiator"" and ""American Gangster,"" I thought for sure they'd strike gold again here. I even avoided all early reviews before watching this. Unfortunately, after watching ""Robin Hood,"" I was a little less satisfied. Apparently, many others were too.It should be emphasized that this is an origin story; not the tale of Robin Hood the outlaw but rather how he came to be a respected soldier and leader before being outcast as an outlaw. That's fine, if you do it right. Unfortunately, the plot seems heavily cluttered at the beginning with too much exposition. Time and time again, I kept wondering what point would be a good beginning point. I think it was when Robin went to Nottingham that I felt the film was finally beginning. Unfortunately, that was forty minutes (or so) into the picture.Technically, this is a quite accomplished film. The production design is very convincing, and the cinematography gives an appropriate rustic look to the picture. Some of the performances work too. Mark Strong is starting to rack up the villains, and he gives us another memorable one in Sir Godfrey. Cate Blanchett is solid as always, playing the self sufficient Maid Marion. And the veteran Max Von Sydow is sometimes moving as her father. Crowe's alright as Robin Hood, but his English accent seems to go in and out and he's not the most memorable among the cast.Unfortunately, the weakness is within the plot. Sometimes, I was wondering to myself if there was a good 90-100 minute movie in this 140 minute feature. There's just too much clutter early on; lots of people, places, battles, and movements to remember, but a lot of it feels irrelevant by the end of the picture. Had the film focused itself on a select group of characters and events, we may have had an origin tale to remember (considering the talent involved).",Robin Hood
240,merdiolu,Robin Hood : How Magna Carta Charter was created,8,16 May 2010,"There are roughly three kinds of directors....Directors who made movies just for dumb fun , entertainment for ignorant masses and a quick buck in box office. ( mainstream Hollywood directors are usually like that ) 2) Directors who think their profession as an art forms and make productions like an art work with diligence 3) Directors who combine above both successfullyRidley Scott is a director who is in third category above. He entertains but he never loses focus , drama , serious air , character development , good scripting and plot line , editing , camera work etc...His movies are entertaining but also intelligent with characters , events , scenario development...Like a lot of directors he works with a group of established high quality actors and they do not disappoint....Russell Crowe who is professional actor worked Ridley with several other productions ( most notably ""Gladiator"" of course ) and this duo always gets some positive results...Cate Blanchett is quite admirable with her performance here as Marion. Other actors like another Scott favorite Mark Strong , William Hurt , Oscar Isaacs and Max Von Sydow ( hell he is 81 and he is still in his top form. His character was quite good and performed nicely. ) and other supporting cast also combine their talents and creating a very interesting version of Robin Hood.Interesting because this Robin Hood is devoid of most of the known/memorized myths and clichés about character itself. It tells the origin story of an ordinary archer in King ""Lion Heart"" Richard's British Army after Third Crusade before he became the legendary outlaw Robin Hood. Due to a series of events , misunderstandings , deceptions and conspiracies Robin Longstride chooses the path which will make him a myth figure in future. There are lots of conspiracies , plotting , historical events and background like French invasion attempt of British Isles in 1215 and origins of Magna Carta Charter.A little history lesson here : Magna Carta Charter ( Charter of Freedoms ) is the first official document and law which limited King's authority , order and crowns absolute grip on people/nobility. Charter made King below the law and made it clear that his will could be bound by law. It was written and originated in Britain in 1216 during King John's rule after King ""Lion Heart"" Richard died and French invasion attempt. Due to high taxes King John's ( or Price John before Richard's death ) rule was quite unpopular among common people and nobility , aristocrats. After a civil war between King John and nobles who rebelled his authority , John was forced to sign Magna Carta. Magna Carta was arguably the most significant early influence on the extensive historical process that led to the rule of constitutional law today in the modern world we live in. Magna Carta influenced the development of the common law and many constitutional documents...Only things I didn't like in the movie : First , Nazification of French. When I watched French soldiers got peasants together in a barn by force and then set it on fire I groaned ""No please not another ""THE PATRIOT"" ( a terrible movie about American Revolution made by Roland Emmerich in 2000 ) mess !"" Second is just we got real Robin Hood legend , how it was created movie ended just like that ! Maybe they are thinking a sequel. I don't know....Aside from that historical details and camera work is fine. You get a little sense of ""Saving Private Ryan"" nostalgia in French landing attempt and final battle. Director Ridley Scott must have watched Saving Private Ryan a few times....So if you like a movie about serious themes , issues , history with some fun combined together watch Robin Hood...",Robin Hood
241,EdwardCarter,The worst Robin Hood movie ever,1,28 May 2010,"This movie is so overlong and boring I almost fell asleep several times. Of course it was never going to be good anyway because all the actors are far too old. I just don't understand why they cast an ugly 46-year-old fat thug like Crowe with his huge beer gut and horrid gravel voice as Robin Hood. Errol Flynn will always be the best, at least he was only 28, athletic and actually sounded English. 41-year-old Cate Blanchett looks as ugly as sin, is far too old to play ""Maid"" Marian, and unsurprisingly has zero chemistry with Crowe. It would have been so much better if they had cast younger, British actors like Christian Bale and Robin and Keira Knightley as Marian instead of a far too old Crowe and Blanchett.0/10.

243,jgregg42,Robin Hood the Prequel,7,14 May 2010,"I questioned myself before viewing ""Robin Hood"" (directed by Ridley Scott) – do we really need another movie about Robin Hood? It seems to me that there is a retelling of this fictional character every 20 years, and each director and actor has their own take on how the legendary character should be portrayed (Errol Flynn, Sean Connery, Kevin Costner, Daffy Duck, etc). In the end I hope this isn't just another ploy for studios to make a buck but hopefully to introduce the legend to a new generation. The film begins with Marion Loxley's (Cate Blanchett) village of Nottingham being over run by thieves in the night. It was refreshing to see a strong woman role in this story that is set back in the 1200's. She doesn't need to be saved by a strong male character; she is doing fine on her own. The plot line is set up quite quickly and if you can adjust to the English and French accents in time you should be able to follow what is going on in England and France. King Richard the Lionheart (Danny Huston) is crusading his way back to England while his 'runt of the litter' brother Prince John (Oscar Isaac) is the interim king back home. Prince John is an immature, boy king who is making horrible, selfish decisions for his country. There is a lot of action in the first 30 minutes, in addition to the village being attacked; there is an attack on a castle and an ambush, which raises the death toll considerably. Over 800 years ago the archers must have been incredibly accurate or the arrows must have been incredibly sharp. The archers' victims seemed to die immediately no matter where they were hit; unless, the victim was crucial to carry on the story line, then that person would live just long enough to deliver his lines and then die. We are introduced to Robin Longstride (Russell Crowe) during the initial battle sequence and even though he helps his immediate friends in the English army, he is a more or less a jerk. Crowe was perfect for this character. Longstride soon becomes an army deserter and through some convenient identity theft, he hitches a free ride back to England with his crew of miscreants. There he delivers on a promise where he ends up in Nottingham and Marion grudgingly takes him in. All along Longstride is the reluctant hero. He doesn't really want to help, but hey, since he is there he might as well do something with his free time. England is about to go to war with itself because Prince John has trusted the wrong man and it is up to Robin to unify the country before the evil French invade. Why Robin? Why aren't any of the other thousands of Englishmen qualified to do the job? I am still not clear on why Robin is giving motivational speeches. There are a few scenes with undertones relevant to today and the United States' involvement in the conflicts in the Middle East. If this movie came out a few years ago while George W. was still in office, the commentary would have had a stronger impact. The grand finale battle is on a beach where the action has been seen several times before in similar movies. We have been overrun with these sword and shield movies (even Scott has contributed to this with ""Kingdom of Heaven"" and ""Gladiator"") that when a good medieval story comes along we compare it to ""Lord of the Rings"" or ""Braveheart"" or ""Gladiator."" Have you seen ""Kingdom of Heaven""? Great movie, but it is easily forgettable. So where does this lead the film industry when it wants to tell a story that takes place in the time frame of 1,000 A.D. – 1,600 A.D.? There has to be hundreds of stories that screenwriters can draw from in that era. The caveat is that they have to make it memorable. ""Robin Hood"" isn't giving us much new material. After all is done, we are introduced to how Robin Longstride became Robin of the Hood. And, when that happens, you might think to yourself ""yes, now it's pay back time, let's go Robin, kick some ass."" But, no. It ends. Ouch. Should you see this movie? Sure, go ahead. The acting was brilliant; Blanchett can't really deliver a bad performance. The action sequences were tolerable (the film has a PG-13 rating; it isn't dripping with too much blood). However, with our exposure to so many Middle Ages films out there, I feel that this is going to be one of those movies that you see once and forgot you saw it in three months.",Robin Hood

Following the death of Richard the Lionheart in battle, Robin and three other common soldiers attempt to return to their homeland, having spent a decade fighting abroad. Along the way, they came across an ambush of the King's guard; an English Knight with French lineage. The King of France had ordered Sir Godfrey to assassinate Richard. Having discovered the King is already slain Sir Godfrey is chased off by the arrival of Robin and his companions. Aiming to return to England safely and richer in pocket than they left it Robin and his men steal the armor of the slain Knights and head for the English ships on the coast under the guise of noblemen. Upon arrival in England, Robin is chosen to inform the Royal family of the King's death and witnesses the crowning of King John. The arrogant King John shows no remorse to his poor Kingdom and demands harsh taxes to be collected, sending Sir Godfrey off to the North with the task of raising revenue. Despite King John's jealousy, he asks Robin for his help in defeating the French and saving England. well, as for the rest of the movie, I kinda slept through it hehe... IT'S A SNOOZE FEST!The movie was just too long, too Boring and missed the whole point of a Robin Hood story. This felt like an idiot war film that just happened to have the character Robin Hood in it.

245,octagon88,"It ain't all good in ""The Hood.""",3,23 May 2010,"I would go into more detail about the plot, but frankly, I was so freaking confused by this absurdly complex story that I had enough trouble following it, let alone explaining it. The characters were one-dimensional enough that it was still relatively easy to figure out which one was Robin Hood, but beyond that, deciphering what the heck was going on was about as easy as playing Boggle in Mandarin. I can handle confusing plots - I loved Syriana, which is the king of complexity - but confusing and boring is a deadly combination, and Robin Hood has that in spades. The first hour of the film is incredibly dull, mostly because Robin isn't an interesting protagonist and John is a painfully static bad guy. After that, the battle scenes around which the film is built turn the story into a swamp of double-crossings and ""shocking"" revelations.The most depressing thing is this: the battle scenes are the worst part of the movie! I have never been a big fan of Ridley Scott. I think his films contain no style whatsoever and unlike his peers Martin Scorsese and Steven Spielberg, he is less of an artist than he is a butcher. But the work he does in Robin Hood may be his worst. The final battle scene is the only comprehensible one because Scott ignores everything going on except for one sword-fight. With as bloated a budget as this film is reported to have, you'd think that Ridley Scott would have put more of an effort into actually crafting a well-made film, but it seems like that wasn't a concern of his.Either way, I would not recommend this movie. Even the acting seemed abit off. I don't know, it just didn't focus on the audience feeling anything which was very disappointing. 3/10",Robin Hood

Amazing - I could forgive the poor direction, poor script, poor acting as well as the cliché-after-cliché-after-cliché plot but visually he's usually a master so I can't forgive the poor scenes, dull sets and poor cinematography. A slightly more interesting twist to the Robin Hood legend is the one plus I could find; there was nothing else. The dialogue and storyline could have come from some 1950s B-movie starring Robert Taylor or Randolph Scott. And, to put in my pennyworth on Crowe's accent, it's definitely mostly scouse; at least with von sydow you know he can only do a Nazi German accent and that is what you got in his role as an English lord. Little John's Protestant Northern Ireland accent is a bit too anachronistic though. I believe the writer was the same one who wrote L.A. Confidential, a superb film and easily Crowe's best performance too, and the cinematographer did Kingdom of Heaven.

So the particular style of filming and photographing fitted the mood of the film perfectly.Solid performances, no further comment. Crowe is good as always, Blanchett does it again and William Hurt, whom I haven't seen performing much in the past, was very good as well.

This movie just didn't do it for me.Nothing in the movie makes sense at all. All I knew is that in the beginning, Robin Hood and all those other guys were on a Crusade, and that's it. Everything else was cloudy and confusing. Why did they put Robin Hood in the stocks? Was it because he punched that guy for no reason? The movie moves on to that little town that gets raided by those kids with creepy masks on. What was that all about? I don't think they ever explained why they were wearing masks and what they wanted or what the point of their appearances were. There were a lot of battle scenes, which were exciting to some extent, but they were outweighed by long, boring scenes with people just talking. And what were they talking about?? The accents, I think were either over-exaggerated, or badly done, because I had no idea what any of the characters were saying half the time. And what was with Russel Crowe? His voice was like a British robot and his voice was never raised from a whisper, practically. On top of that, what was Robin Hood after? What were his motivations of fighting and whatever else he was doing? What was the king dude's problem? What was the whole thing with the bald guy and the French? What were they trying to do, invade England? Why did he declare Robin Hood an outlaw (in the funniest yelling voice possible)? What did Robin Hood do to be considered an outlaw? Didn't he win the battle and save England from the French invasion?? Wouldn't that make him a hero? Okay, this review is getting too long with my questions. On top of the many confusing moments and the boredom, the movie was two and a half hours!! I was so restless in the movie theater, that I could have screamed in frustration. For some reason, the rest of my family didn't want to leave the theater, and they didn't like it either! Bottom line is, that this movie was a waste of time. Maybe not AS big a waste as Avatar, but a waste nonetheless. I couldn't hear what the characters were saying, there were too many long talking scenes, the battles were confusing as to who was fighting who and why. The best moments in the movie where 1. when you can see the arrow leaving Robin Hood's bow in extreme slow motion, and 2. when the King screams in the weirdest way possible, ""I declare him to be an OUTLAAAAAW!!""

I can't believe I've actually purchased this movie on DVD and wasted my money on a boring piece of junk. OK, I have to admit that it was a purchase on impulse, I was looking for a good film to watch, I saw the cover and thought ...Russell Crow and Cate Blanchett in Robin Hood it can't be that Horrible right ? I was Wrong Wrong Wrong ! this movie is Horrible it's worse than horrible ! And it has no credibility to the Robin Hood legend what so ever !Robin Hood wore Green, he Wasn't a king follower he was an outlaw, he wasn't in his 40s he was a young man in his 20s which is why the casting of Russell Crow as Robin is horrible ! He lived in a forest with a group of outlaws like himself and they called them selves the merry men. There were other characters with him like Maid Marion who was a single woman not a widow ! and Big John who was a bishop, there weren't any blind father-in-laws, or dying first husbands or anything from that sort ! But most importantly Robin Hood stole from the rich and gave it to the poor that's why he is called the King of Thieves and that is not shown here at all ! In a matter of fact that idea is completely ignored by the director which makes it hard to believe that this is a Robin Hood story. The Cast choice is bad ! Russell Crow hardly delivers and Cate Blanchett falls out of place !, There is almost NO Plot, the movie is boring the action scenes ""blink"" and you miss them. The story is boring, the characters are all dull and flat I didn't care for any of them. Robin Hood fought the corrupt Lords of England (they were his enemies) he didn't fight for them !

I don't know why it is not highly rated because I really loved this one's unique take on the Robin Hood legend, giving him an origin story and a totally different love interest and merry band and taking place with Robin as an older man. It was refreshing, well acted and directed. I can watch it repeatedly and enjoy the varied emotions it evokes: the humor, the sadness, the pain and suffering, the lurking evil and the joy of getting back. I was intrigued by the many back stories introduced, such as the French intervention, the military influences, the royal intrigues and craziness. That last arrow shot by Robin was thrilling to watch.

252,mcampbelljh1,Before Robin Hood,8,30 April 2014,"I thought it was a pretty good movie, with an interesting story line. Not what I expected for something called Robin Hood. As it really was the story of how Robin became Robin Hood. The movie doesn't follow the classic tale we all know of Robin Hood and his band of outlaws, but instead concentrates on the events leading up to them being declared outlaws and how they had to go to the forest. I'm actually glad about that as it was quite an interesting movie. There was good acting by most of the cast. Russell Crowe good as usual in these types of action hero roles. Cate Blanchett dynamic and appealing as ever and always good in these classic tales. Matthew Macfadyen role as the sheriff of Nottingham was diminished by the script's story-line which was prior to the Sheriff becoming the evil hand of the king, but he played what was given to him well. William Hurt who I didn't even recognize at first, had a minor role. Max von Sydow as the elderly lord of Loxley gave the story the historical connection to how Robin became thought of as Sir Robert Loxley. I didn't much like Mark Strong as the evil Godfred but perhaps that because he played his role well.. I thought there was a bit too much in the way of wars and fighting, and perhaps the script could of spent more time in the classic Robin Hood tale rather than all the wars action scenes (The crusades, defending Loxley, the battle with the French Invasion). Perhaps a bit more of Sherwood Forest and story relating to that part of Robin's life would of enhanced this picture. But all in all it was a good watchable movie which kept my interest because I didn't know the script ahead of time.",Robin Hood

254,tanyatzatmary,Terrible and unbelievable casting choices.,1,27 May 2021,As always with modern media this movie chooses to cast people into roles that you just cannot possibly suspend your disbelief. It detracts from the entire thing and jerks you out of any attempt to believe this is a period piece and not just another schlocky action flick. This absolutely destroyed this movie for me. I really wanted to like it. But I couldn't.,Robin Hood
255,kdavidbushnell,7.2?! Ridley hit's the spot again,10,19 May 2010,"I would have gave this movie a 9/10 but I don't like the fact that its only 7.2 at only 10,000 votes. Everyone on IMDb acts like they are some great filmmakers themselves and act SOOOOO PRETENTIOUS towards any good movie Hollywood happens to put out. GET OVER YOURSELVES. I'm in filmschool buddies and I know cinematography, acting, lighting, directing, writing..... This movie was 100% WONDERFUL besides a couple cliché' moments.So IMDb fans, how does Avatar and Taken get like 8/9 ??? and this wonderful work of cinema gets like a 6 or 7. Go to filmschool before you talk out of your butts people. Don't READ THE DUMB PRETENTIOUS REVIEWS BY 19 YO think they Know-it-alls.Ridley's directing is just as good as it ever was if not better, the man can't be stopped. It's nearly a flawless movie besides a few cliché' lines; but hay, that might happen in an epic historical film. All performances were great, but I really think Oscar Isaac as Prince/King John and Danny Huston Killlls it as King RIchard. Crowe and Blanchett are wonderful together. I wish I could have saw more of King Richard, I really loved Huston's performance. Then King John is nothing less than spectacular. The story is very interesting. The movie starts off pretty fast paced and keeps it going for a good half hour, then it slows down a bit and involves Great character development. Then the intensity picks back up with the Nottingham scene and the final battle. And the ending is so proper and well thought-out that it really just tops it off with your favorite slice of fruit and makes it a great film. Of course in a Ridley Schott film the cinematography is going to be great. But seriously this film had the best cinematography in modern films! It was almost mind blowing cinematography... It was like Lord of the Rings mixed with Saving Private Ryan cinematography. It will surely win many awards for cinematography. The dialogue is well written and entertaining which is very necessary in a movie that takes place in the 12 century. It was so good and the characters were so fun I would love to see a sequel with the story we already know. O did I mention the action sequences were awesome!",Robin Hood
256,Ben_Horror,Robin Hood: the mullet-free edition,7,20 May 2010,"This movie had a somewhat strange development history. First it started off as a 'revisionist' take on the old Robin Hood myth. It was going to be called 'Nottingham' and would star Russell Crowe in the role of the Sheriff. It was meant to tell the story from the Sheriff's perspective with Robin Hood being the actual villain of the piece. That actually sounded like an intriguing premise, but then later on strange rumors started to leak that Crowe was actually going to play two roles: both the Sheriff and the Robin Hood role. It was meant to be a bold and unique retelling of an old story that would stun people's expectations. Whatever their initial intentions were, director Ridley Scott and Russell Crowe clearly lacked the courage of their convictions because the story they ended up settling for is a more or less traditional retelling, except it's set up as a kind of an odd 'prequel' of sorts. There is very little 'robbing from the rich and giving to the poor' going on here. Instead what we get is an 'origin' story. We see the Robin Hood in the days before he became an outlaw, fighting for King Richard in France, before going AWOL after the King's death (by a cook) with some of his fellow men. In a neat twist, he uses the identity of a dead soldier as a way of bringing the dead King crown back to England and in doing so, hopefully his own ticket out of France. There's some stuff about a sword, a romance with Cate Blanchett/Lady Marian and the 'Forest Charter' before attentions are turned to preventing an invasion by the French, spearheaded by a French/English spy, the identity of whom only Robin knows about. It's fair to say that there is a heck of a lot going on in this movie. The story is vast and there's a lot to cram into the still epic running time. There are also plenty of characters jostling for your attention on the screen. So much so in fact that Russell Crowe won't have to worry about anyone overshadowing him the way Alan Rickman did in the Kevin Costner version. This movie is trying to service too many characters for that to happen. Tone-wise, the movie is as far removed from Robin Hood: Prince of Thieves as you can possibly get. You won't find any fluffy blow-dried mullets in here. The mood is one of dirt and grime, and the medieval setting itself is very grim. All the cast seem to be over the age of 30 and this makes their characters seem even more authentic, haggard and lived in. But it still looks glorious and there's always something happening to please the eye. Overall the movie is produced on a very large and epic scale. There is a bit of CGI going on, but it's so subtle you wouldn't even notice it. It's refreshing to see things done 'in camera' for a change. Director Ridley Scott is an undisputed master at this sort of thing. If you've already seen Kingdom of Heaven, then you'll have a good idea what this looks like. He's one of the few directors – comparable to David Lean – who can effectively pull off epics such as these. But strangely it seems as though he has taken it upon himself to atone for crimes against the Muslim nation courtesy of Europe. Having already tackled Middle Eastern themes in both Kingdom of Heaven and Body of Lies, it stills gets a mention here: at one point Crowe lays out the unholy activities of the Crusades to a shocked King Richard. Crowe is always worth watching and makes for a very good Robin Hood. Even though he is in his mid forties, he really suits the role and is probably one of the most realistic Robin Hoods so far. But he seems afflicted with the same syndrome that affected Leonardo Dicaprio in Gangs of New York: his accent is all over the place. Crowe was in denial, but the fact is his accent is very patchy. At first it appears to be Irish before switching to another, possibly Welsh, during the course of the movie. This happens several times without explanation. A legacy of re-shoots, rushed ADR who knows. However, the always-reliable Mark Strong is on hand for charismatic bad guy duties. Honestly, it's about time somebody gave him a leading role for a change and not condemn him to a career playing supporting roles. There is one odd bit in the movie, though: during an attack by the aforementioned Mark Strong and his cronies, we see Lady Marian receive a sword blow to the neck. At first we think: what a bold move – they're going to kill off Lady Marian! Then in the very next shot, she appears totally uninjured and no reference is ever made to the incident again! What gives, Ridley? As mentioned above this movie is a prequel. But a prequel to what exactly? To all the Robin Hood movies that came before? Or is the Scott/Crowe duo setting this up with the plan on making more of these? It certainly seems so. And the viewer can't help but feel a little short changed at the end: certain aspects are left unresolved and characters go unpunished. Clearly this is meant to set up a sequel. The cynic in me would say that this movie was crafted out of nothing but the deep regret of not having allowed the Maximus character to live in Gladiator, thus killing off any possibility of a sequel. After all, the tone and look is quite similar. Crowe is even sporting an almost identical beard and haircut for God's sake. Still it is a good movie, and despite some occasional lulls in the story, it looks great and passes the time easily enough.",Robin Hood
257,Caribstu,No problem for the lawyers,3,11 September 2010,"ROBIN HOOD This review contains a spoiler.As I sat down to watch this film, my first thought was; 'why would anyone remake Robin Hood?, after all it's been done 100 times already, what is there you can possibly do that's different? If anyone can bring something new to the story then I guess Ridley Scott can"".In many ways I was right, Ridley Scott did indeed bring something new, and at the same time there is nothing you can do to the story of Robin Hood. Perplexing? The film itself is a good film. The set and costume design is fantastic carrying the audience back to the middle ages without being all 'middle earth'. The pace at first is quite slow but interesting as Scott reverts back to the long lost art of story telling, beginning in France at the tail end of a crusade he does pull you into a fabulously woven story. There's a wonderful scene where the lead character and his band of men are rowed down the Thames to an unknown palace to present the crown of King Richard the Lion Heart to Queen Eleanor. Then we are whisked away to rural Nottingham and introduced to it's citizens including the blind but deft Sir Walter Loxley. Adopted by the elder man as his son, Robin becomes part of the community and when the barons of Northern England are called together, Robin attends on behalf of Loxley. The film which had very much been a preamble through the open fields of England suddenly takes a turn. Robin, a lowly archer is now in command of an army, and speaking to Knights and Lords as their equal, even interrupting the King in public. As the French attempt to invade, an immense battle takes place on the beaches of southern England, hand to hand fighting, wielded axes cut through chainmail, arrows pierce the air, one man, possibly Harold, takes on in the eye, horses buck and their riders fall to the bloodied sand. The English occupy the high ground and despite charging onto the beach beneath their own archers arrows, battle is a slaughter, the French turn and retreat, England is saved.Finally when the dust has settled, the peasants and surf returned to their villages, the Barons and landed gentry meet with King John at .. (Runnymede possibly.. We're not told) to sign the Magna Carte, at the same time, the Sheriff of Nottingham pins a note upon an ancient oak tree, that Robin Longstride is an outlaw and abruptly the film ends. And so we are told, the legend begins.For the most part a well told story, and as expected from Ridley Scott a wonderfully shot film. However the story told is nothing to do with the actual legend of Robin Hood, whilst the main body of the film was good, until the rushed and ridiculous fight scenes at the end, you just spent the entire film thinking 'what does this have to do with Robin Hood?"" Then to end it with a closing shot of an old hand calligraphed parchment saying ..""And so the Legend begins"" is not just absurd, but insulting, yes 'The legend"" the 'real' legend of the real Robin Longstride, known as Robin of the Hood. Isn't that what we sat down to watch? Not some made up fictitious nonsensical film which serves only as a 'taster' for the inevitable sequel. Talk about a scam.. Getting ripped off. This film is the celluloid equivalent of being sold swamp land in Louisiana.I would expect a director to start with a 'fill in the background' story tracing Robin's steps from the Crusades back to Nottingham and explaining what drove him to become the outlaw he did as that is an integral part of the story, but Ridley Scott could have told that in 20 minutes, and should have told it with historical accuracy. What we didn't need was an entire film to be a fictitious background story.Clearly it's made for the US audience who in general can probably sit in large numbers and watch an epic tale of olde not noticing the inaccuracies. Nor are they likely to notice that Russell Crowe's accent is that of a relatively unknown regional dialect from midway between the Lancastrian town of Annoy and a small Northumbrian village called Distract. It is in fact a mix of an Annoying and Distracting accent, a masterful interpretation by Crowe.For us Brits though from the beginning to the end you can pick both historical and geographical faults with this film, and that wonderful scene of Robin rowing down the Thames to present the crown of the dead King Richard to his mother, do we really need to go into that? It is simply pointless mentioning any of the inaccuracies as the entire film is so outrageously far fetched that honestly Ridley Scott would have been much better off just inventing a lead character's name, 'Sir Ethelred Longshadow' and calling the film ""A Tale of Ye Olde Middle England"" perhaps. That way without preconceptions or any subconscious associations to factual history I probably would have enjoyed the film.At the end, 2hrs and 29mins, during the end credits it said 'The characters and events depicted in this photoplay are fictitious, any similarity to any persons, living or dead, is purely coincidental'  well luckily for the lawyers, even though Robin Hood, King John et al were real people, in this film there was no similarity.3/10",Robin Hood
258,paul51,Understated failure,3,18 May 2010,"The movie starts out with much more realistic leanings than any other iteration I've ever encountered and is quite refreshingly understated for much of it's duration, and *most* of the action is well within the boundaries of dramatic license and suspension of disbelief. The acting across the board is commendable.However, the movie is slow to build, and never at any point does the movie do a passable job of engendering care for any of the characters, Robin and Marion included. The sub plot of Robin's past is barely an afterthought. Nothing happens in the movie to truly stoke his memory. He simply closes his eyes on command and is given perfect clarity and total recall. What could have been a saving stroke of grace for this film---the recasting of the traditional antagonists in even a slightly different light---proves to be nothing more than a tease. They all return to traditional form without truly giving us a moment's wondering.All that having been said, it is the last few minutes of the movie, the ""reverse Normandy"" sequence, that completely and utterly sends this movie into the refuse bin.1) It shamelessly borrows its cinematography from Saving Private Ryan, complete with underwater shots of drowning soldiers and arrows piercing the water. And apparently, we're supposed to accept that the Medieval French had Higgins boats. Need more be said? Facepalm worthy when they're sailing in, worth raucous and derisive laughter when they slide ashore and drop their ramp.2) Sudden reversal of realistic leanings---Marion riding in wearing armor that is an obvious nod to the armor Mary Elizabeth Mastrantonio wore in Robin Hood: Prince of Thieves, followed by previously and heretofore unexplained Lord of the Flies children, now all astride Shetland Ponies and suddenly rather excellent cavalrymen.3) Obligatory 300 yard arrow shot through the neck of the principal antagonist. It even fails to be a properly ignominious death---the last time you see him, he's still alive and smiling.I didn't expect a great deal from this film. The understated beginning brought me slim hopes, but by the final act the only thing keeping me in my theater seat was my desire to be courteous to the other movie-goers.",Robin Hood
259,dracopticon,A much deeper weave of history. (This review contains spoilers!),8,19 September 2010,"I must say, this film has been and is being met very poorly in peoples views. Why is that? Well, one can easily see, it doesn't describe the story like any other Robin Hood movie. It is instead working hard to produce the tapestry that the happenings we all have heard of, could be happening! And when watching this great story unraveling you can understand that Mr. Scott is more interested in the w h o l e and overall story; that several great powers wanted the little island of Britain as their own.By starting from square one from every corner, Ridley Scott really does a great job. Instead of just describing this as a little private war within the surroundings of Nottingham, you get a good look at what is to be the background of the outcome: the aristocrat's outlawing of the people for taking a stand for ownership of their own lives.Hooray says I! Halfway through the film, I said to myself; ""Yes, of course! That's why the land is torn apart from greed, and that's the reason the noblemen are hating each other nation wide!"" Please watch this without prejudice and do not judge it by the standards of old Robin Hood stories.Just watch it and get lifted by the winds of history.",Robin Hood
260,Momcat_of_Lomita,It just didn't work for me.,6,23 March 2011,"I admire Russell Crowe as an actor. I love the ""Robin Hood"" legend. I think Ridley Scott is one of the great directors of our time.In short, I sat down wanting to like this movie. And in the end, I just couldn't like it.Part of the problem: when you sit down to view a movie, you only have a very short time to get to know and to ""buy into"" the characters. If the look of the movie keeps you from readily identifying the characters, you have a problem.In any kind of pre-Renaissance costume drama where the characters are all dressed much alike, you can really have a problem figuring out who the characters are, especially if many of the scenes are very dark, which makes it hard to see the characters, and if those scenes involve a lot of action, with quick cuts and a lot of confusion on screen. This was a problem for me early in the movie. Sure, I know Russell Crowe and I know he's the ""good guy,"" and that helps, but it wasn't enough. I had trouble in the first half-hour or so of the movie figuring out who was who and keeping track of everything that was going on. It helped to be able to TiVo the movie, so I could go back and look at things, or pause the action to sort it out. But if I had seen the movie in a theater, I wouldn't have been able to do that, and it would have been quite frustrating in some of the scenes.It was also difficult to understand what was going on with the historical context. FWIW, this movie involves some of the same historical characters as ""The Lion in Winter,"" the sons of Eleanor of Aquitaine who were vying for the throne of England while at the same time staving off challenges from other crowned heads of Europe. I'm thankful that I had some historical knowledge to give me context for this set-up, because if I hadn't had it, I would have been completely lost. As it was, it wasn't quite enough: I couldn't figure out what was going on until after the movie, when I sat down with my laptop and did some review, and then went back and re-played some of the scenes. Again, had I been in the theater when I saw this movie, I would have been lost.That's not to say the movie is a total loss. Russell Crowe is very watchable, and the interplay between Crowe and Cate Blanchett was good to watch. Also, Mark Strong makes a convincing bad guy, although I couldn't really figure out his motivations.But in the end, I'd have to say that for most people, this movie probably wouldn't work, and so I really wouldn't recommend it. If you're going to watch it, I highly recommend that you be prepared to go back and forth in some scenes. I also recommend that you read a little bit about Eleanor of Aquitaine and her sons King John, Henry Plantagenet, Richard III, and Geoffery Plantagenet.And if you're really not inclined to do that much preparation for a movie, then I recommend you give ""Robin Hood"" a miss and sit down to watch ""The Lion in Winter"" with Katherine Hepburn and Peter O' Toole instead. Same basic characters, sans Robin Hood, but a much better movie.",Robin Hood
261,alreadyseenbeentaken,A solid movie,7,26 September 2021,"This review my come 11 years late. But tbh, I wasn't a big fan of another Robin Hood movie back then. But now, after rewatching it, so many years later I must say:
Great cast, costumes, sets. Good music. A decent interpretation of Robin Hood. And a lot of humor. Maybe a bit weak in the last quarter.The movie is charming. Would recommend giving it another try.",Robin Hood
262,ungy357,Robin Hood Begins,9,13 May 2010,"Let's start by getting a few things out of the way: I actually enjoyed ""Robin Hood: Prince of Thieves"", the much maligned Kevin Costner/Kevin Reynolds 1991 version of the timeless tale. Yes, Costner's accent was atrocious (though more High School and community theater actors who trash it should consider how sure their British accent is good, because, guess what guys: most of you who have commented to me on it over the years really aren't any better at it than Kevin is), but I felt he made a better ""Indiana Jones"" style action hero than he was given credit for, and, for all the films many flaws (for me, the biggest was the all over the map portrayal of the bumbling Satanist Sheriff which was far from Alan Rickman's finest hour) it was fun in the same way the early ""Batman"" films were. So, you won't hear me make any references to how ""unlike other Robin Hoods"", Russell Crowe can speak with an English accent. I didn't find that all that clever when Cary Elwes first said it, and considering some of the dreadful accents Elwes has attempted in films like ""Twister"", you couldn't find a more outrageous example of the pot calling the kettle black.Second (I can't believe I'm saying that after such a long paragraph), the common expectation that this is a ""Gladiator"" rehash is, while understandable from some trailers, off the mark almost entirely. Other than Crowe's appearance and an element of dramatic political machination, the two films bare no real resemblance. Sure, this owes something to ""Gladiator"" and ""Braveheart"" because they're the current standard for this sort of epic. But unless you think ""Iron Man"" is just ""Spider-Man"" covered in metal, ""Robin Hood"" and ""Gladiator"" are not the same film, for better or worse. ""Robin Hood"" isn't as good a film as ""Gladiator"" was. But, for me, it was easily more enthralling than the more recent efforts at sword fight epic genre (i.e. ""300"" or ""Clash of the Titans"").What this is is ""Batman Begins"" to ""Prince of Thieves"" Tim Burton ""Batman"": a more real-world take on the material, and really very much a prequel. This doesn't become the Robin Hood tale as we know it until the very end. Your like or dislike of the film may well depend on how well you respond to that fact.Crowe plays Robin Longstride, an archer in Richard the Lionheart's army who has deserted the brutality of the crusades, joined by his friends Little John, Will Scarlet, and Alan A Dale. On returning to England, a complex (but easy to follow) series of events leads him to assume the idenity of Sir Robert Loxley, a nobleman whose widow, Marian (played by the incomparable Cate Blanchett), is unable to inherit her lands due to English law.Meanwhile, Richard's failure to return places his brother John on the throne. John, of course, is a bad King who overtaxes and brutalizes the people. John is also unaware that his trusted aid and friend Godfrey (Mark Strong, Hollywood's latest villain of choice) is conspiring with the King of France to invade England.Crowe, Blanchett and company all give strong performances, and Max Von Sydow and Eileen Atkins steal the film in supporting roles. Brian Helgeland's screenplay is a smart and literate sort of alternate history Robin Hood: the relationship between King John and his Chancellor (William hurt) echoes Henry VIII and Sir Thomas More. A proposed ""Charter of English Rights"" is essentially the Magna Carte. Helgeland has blended very different elements of British history into the most British of folk tales. It's a bold choice, and one that could easily become laughable. For some, it probably still will be. For me, it worked.It comes down most of all to Ridley Scott's ability to tell and pace a story, and to create stunning visuals. He may not be at the very top of his game here, but he's close. This is the most briskly entertaining film he's since ""Matchstick Men"".By no means is this the definitive cinematic ""Robin Hood"". If there is or can be such a thing, it's the Errol Flynn/Michael Curtiz classic, but even that version is hampered by the fact that Flynn was a better stuntman than actor. And certainly there are generations that argue the Disney animated film (the first ""Robin Hood"" I knew) or the Sean Conney/Audrey Hepburn vehicle ""Robin and Marian"" is the only true Robin Hood. For that matter, there are those who feel that way about ""Prince of Thieves"", ""Men in Tights"", or any of the various TV incarnations.For me, Robin Hood is the quintessential adventure story. I'm up for revisiting it any time someone has has a truly interesting or new take on the material, or just can tell it well. I believe that Ridley Scott and company have created a unique and interesting film that won't make anyone forget their previous favorite versions, but adds something to the history of Robin Hood on screen. And, most importantly, they've made a summer adventure blockbuster that's more satisfying than a lot of what has been out there lately.",Robin Hood
263,cribyn44,"""Null point"" for Ridley Scott's disastrous bore and mish mash of a film",1,16 May 2010,"As an admirer of Ridley Scott's work - especially ""Gladiator"" but above all the totally outstanding ""Kingdom of Heaven"" - my wife and I went to see this in the cinema with some ""good"" expectations. Unfortunately, I couldn't wait for the whole farrago to come to a painful conclusion. The film is a total mess because its screenplay is simply horrendous. It has no proper ""story"" or structural narrative, the whole thing being like a quilt made up of different strands of so-called ""story"", which are then stitched together at odd times [""stiched-up"" for the audience is a better description] in the forlorn hope that this will somehow make a ""whole"" thing emerge on the screen. The fault lies entirely with the scriptwriter, Brian Helgeland, for the most total rubbish screenplay I have ever seen - as well as with Ridley Scott for allowing himself to spend money and time filming this rubbish. Other commentators - especially ""justin 55839"": ""A Disaster of a Movie"" - have correctly picked up all the holes in the script and the film. This film really needs to be consigned to the rubbish bin. The only thing that kept me somehow half-interested was listening to the excellent soundtrack. Except there again, certain horrors of horror kept coming to the fore. I couldn't believe I was hearing 19th or 20th century Irish folk music as the background to the olde ye English folks people of the 12th century enjoying themselves around the village camp fires at night!

But it's also on paper the film collapses, because Brian Helgeland's script is ramshackle, wobbly and downright uninteresting. The result is like everyone concerned is making / acting in a film of their own!Russell Crowe is, well, his usual self and makes no attempt to conceal his phoned in performance. Cate Blanchett at least tries harder, but ends up portraying a woman from a completely different era, and where did she get that accent?Costumes, sets are as top notch as you would expect, but the battle scenes, especially the climatic one against the French invasion (D Day-style landing craft? C'mon!) are confused and lack drama. But by the time this procession of clichés has played out and we reach that stage, you won't be caring either way.",Robin Hood

266,jonjonat,Robin Hood,10,14 May 2010,The Best Movie I've ever seen and there's no doubt about it. It begins with long awaited legend that calls himself Robin and wears no hood. But him and his friends are on a quest to stop the evil king. Although the storyline may be too long the battle sequences were terrific and not even one drop of blood was shown during the battles. Robin's wife Marrilyn is his long awaited true love and is personal to say that it's about time he has found someone. The acting was brilliant for an olden day movie and of course the villains were awesome too especially the bold headed dude. I was awaiting nothing at the start but the final battle was excellent especially when Robin finished the man off with his bow and arrow. There were many funny points too especially when the man against robin hood got his finger chopped off by an arrow of Robin for trying to hang a wanted poster for Robin.

267,stefrance99,Why oh why........have I lived long enough to see such infamy?,2,23 May 2010,"When Kevin Costner made it to play Robin Hood I was worried for all the good reasons, and was not disappointed, when I heard that Ridley Scot was preparing Robin Hood I was looking forward to it, I was sure there would have been some fantasies like in Gladiator but not the point of turning the movie into a boring pile of crap that is not even speaking of Robin Hood but Robert of Luxley.Historicaly speaking it's full of non sense, Richard death happens indeed in Challus but after he had returned once to England following the crusades.Phillipe August the French King has never ever tried to invade England, even less in those ridiculous landing crafts, he focused in taking back English owned land (Normandy, Aquitaine etc..) that was belonging to the Richards Family.Richard speaks only French as all Nobles in England for this was the Plantagenest heritage (until the war of the Roses) How on earth can Robin Wood have been able to learn how to read? Being a low born he should not have had accessed this knowledge...Lady Marion by her rank would not have touched the earth or rode horse the way she did, even less learn how to fight, use a bow or wear and armour...Dover is the closest place between France and England, but it's also 250km away from Nottingham how did they managed to reach it in less than 48h What is it with Marion and her poney cavalry joining the fight? Walter's burial, England is a Christian country by that time and they bury their people, they don't burn them!!! To summarise this is a slow pace movie, the director is missing the point.

I thought movies were supposed to be entertaining, if it wasn't for Crowe's unbelievable accent(s) there would be little in this film to even bother writing about.I found myself looking at my watch and yawning 45 minutes into the film wondering when it would ever get going. I had zero empathy with the hero mostly because I couldn't understand what he was saying most of the time or why he was speaking like a conglomeration of a cartoon oirishman, an exponent of Ecky Thump and a toothless simpleton.The story was banal, the action sequences were OK if you like mindless excursions into medieval bloodletting ala Hollywood but mostly the acting is appallingly bad throughout with the one exception of Mark Strong who probably thought it was a good idea at the time.The story of Robin Hood is of course legendary and in reality he would have had to have lived to be 316 years old to have done all he is supposed to have done and there is so much that could have been set to film without Ridley Scott venting his filmic licence in such a bad way with this load of old tripe.I hope there is a follow up film that sticks more to the legend instead of trying to make it all shiny and new.

269,vinnieboards,Russell Crowe - man of bad dialects,4,27 September 2010,"To start I have to say that Ridley Scott was quite brave to try and re-invent the Robin Hood legend in this. But not at any point did this re-invention work.Russell Crowe gives a below par performance as the man, this time without tights. He may perform an impeccable English accent but in this film he obviously has issues with dialects. He starts off sounding Irish, then Scouser then Geordie, then general Northerner - its a real mish-mash which never settles down into any consistency.This film is Gladiator without spectacle, Master & Commander without detail. Crowe is competent and yet predictable and does not give the slightest impression that he is actually into this film in any way.The main problem in the film is that the Robin Hood tale is a legend - there is no evidence that he was a champion of the poor, there is little truth in which the film is based on. So whether he is fighting on the beach with Mark Strong or fighting for the affections Cate Blanchett it is difficult to engage with a grittier version of this legend because you still know it probably isn't true. Which is why the fantasy versions, with Errol Flynn and later, Kevin Costner, work better as a spectacle (although Alan Rickman saved the Prince of Thieves on his own). In respect of the these films, you don't need to care.The big and only plus for the film is the acting of Mark Strong who is surely destined for bigger and better things. A sinister baddie of real menace. And thank god Sienna Miller was swapped with Cate Blanchett or this really would have descended into turkey status. I sincerely hope that this is not Max Von Sydow's final film and he definitely deserves a better movie to be remembered by.So all in all, a competent try by Mr Scott and his faithful acting superstar, but hardly spectacular. Unfortunately it looks like Robin Hood films need to be ludicrous - just like the legend itself.",Robin Hood
270,anarresa,"Fun Action, Bit of Story, Touch of Robin Hood",6,29 May 2010,"I was a fan of Gladiator and wanted to see Russell Crowe as an action-leader-of-men again. I was hoping they wouldn't destroy the character of Robin Hood the way Sherlock Holmes was recently destroyed, but Robin Hood is a more flexible archetype rather than a straight character so I plunged in (drive-in double feature, can't beat it).It was a successful movie, a traditional version of Robin Hood, reasonable English history, though not accurate, if you are particular. I imagine Gladiator was similar but am less familiar with Roman history. There was more focus on Robin Hood's early brushes with injustice and political intrigue than his later traditional thieving activities. I was most appreciative of the inclusion of the side characters. Alan a'Dale (Alan Doyle from Great Big Sea, FANTASTIC surprise), Will Scarlet and Friar Tuck were present, though not major characters. What would have been their screen-time was split with Prince/King John, his family and advisors, along with some other noble figures. ""Maid"" Marian was very well designed (I was wondering how it would work with her being older) and Cate Blanchett made full use of her little time.Not a non-stop action fest like I expected, very much on par with Gladiator (if less interesting overall) and worth a viewing.",Robin Hood
271,spock-386-815174,Missed opportunity,3,25 June 2017,"Only recently saw this. This movie is as if it was directed by 2 persons. It starts OK , has a different view as to previous outcomes and wants to be a Braveheart 2 . However despite the good acting ( with exception of Crowe who does not fit here ) the movie falls flat as from the scene where Crowe dances with Blanchet. It becomes cheesy, mellow and in short Hollywood style. Now maybe , just maybe this is not at fault of Scott but rather the producers, but still , the last half destroys the movie completely. I found Oscar Isaac's performance very good and of course Von Sydow and Hurt. The battle scene at the end at the beach made it even worse . No-one can figure out who it fighting who ( something Kurosawa fortunate can due to clans who use different colors ). And the shot where Crow shoots his last arrow is good for the waste bag. One more thing : why do producers think that we need music all over the place ? Credit to the Coens who did an entire movie without any music.",Robin Hood
272,Pete-230,Beautiful cinematography,7,26 May 2010,"Overall quite enjoyable. Cate Blanchett is getting more beautiful as she gets older, and the performances, from Crowe, Blanchett, and Hurt on down are good. Regarding the plot holes and historical fudges, I didn't pay much attention to them - I was caught up in the story, and willingly suspended my disbelief. A little bit too long, but I'm not an editor.The quality of the art direction and photography were first-rate. I especially liked seeing the film grain - it's unusual in a big budget movie these days. So many modern films shoot for icy-cold clean images, but the choice made the pictures and story more palpable. Kudos to Scott and his DP for bucking the trends and making an old-style epic, both from the story and the photography.",Robin Hood
273,linamorenog,Laughable,3,11 November 2020,"I'm very aware this is fiction. But why is it such a tall order for the movie to be congruent? The battle at the end not only shows the very unlikely contemporary taste of having a woman go to battle at the dawn of the XIII century, but it also shows us Robin Hood giving up the tactical advantage of having his opponent fight a literal uphill battle, in favor of the more cinematic beach battle. Lol!!!",Robin Hood
274,tomas-344-902574,Ridley is losing his grip on decent movie making,2,30 September 2012,"Ridley Scott is a horrible director. He can't hack a script together for nothing, especially not when it tries (and fails) to connect to another story. Prometheus was another example of an abysmal story. It seems that instead of Ridley actually going with a half decent story, he finds several plot points or events he wants to happen that supposedly define a story, but then all the filler in between to connect the dots is far fetched. There is nothing heroic or mythological in these scripts. Just action, fighting, drama, etc and pretty awful at that. The Robin as a Crusade fighter almost seemed like a good backstory, but it really was forced with trying to mesh it with the Robin Hood storyline.I found the Robin of Longstride - Robert of Loxley dual identity thing confusing and unnecessary. And I'm sorry, but Russell Crowe was way too old to be Robin Hood, especially as a pre-outlaw. The disjointedness with the other Robin Hood stories just made my head spin.I really hate it when all major Hollywood movies pay the same overpaid big name actors to play parts they really are not good for. Nick Cage, Tom Cruise, Russell Crowe, etc. It's getting ridiculous. It almost seems like some lame attempt at getting more people to view the movie. Otherwise, who'd care about a half baked script with a no-name actor? That would mean the script would HAVE to be more than just junk. I guess getting bigshot actors is Hollywood's way of making up for not actually making decent movies/stories.And Russell Crowe is Australian. Not a good choice for an Englishman. It's been said his accent fluctuated way too much through the movie. But ignoring that, he has a small niche he's good for, and this wasn't it. I think someone like Clive Owen would have done a better job, not messed the accent up, and accomplished the drama/romance better. Crowe was decent as the cold Roman Army general who was betrayed by Caesar, and rose up from the trenches against him. But romance and jovialness is not Crowe's forte. But even with the right acting, the script was so hacked that the romance came from nowhere, just to add the happy ending Robin and Marion nonsense. They hardly spend any time bonding/alone together in the film and then suddenly Robin can say openly that he loves Marion. There was not enough time to show any believable romantic development. The Robin + Marion romance was just forced.I will say that this movie is slightly better than Prometheus. That movie had so much action-horror cliché nonsense that it was laughable and honestly very amateur. But this film has just as much forced plot points to get just enough of the familiar story in, and yet enough new material for us to get the illusion that it was worth creating a whole new movie for.In the end, the ridiculous King John, in some egotistic fit that I didn't believe for a second, decided to burn the governmental charter and declare Robin an outlaw. I can understand burning the charter, but what does declaring Robin an outlaw have to do with that? Where did that come from? What were his motivations? I don't quite know. Seemed like it came from left field. Unless somehow it was out of some momentary jealousy because somebody pointed out that Robin did more to win the war than King John did.The ending was preposterous. The French had to have at least 5,000 men land on shore and somehow a band of what I thought was maybe 500 Englishmen somehow ravaged them. And the sword scene between Mark Strong's character and Robin. Who in their right mind just swings a sword as hard as they can only to cling and clang and never actually stab the other person? I am so tired of seeing swordfights in movies where the swords are used more as sticks to overpower the other person rather than to stab them like a sword is meant to. The samurai have it right, using the least effort to make the kill. And what was the deal with the two boats crushing together (a radical improbability) so it looked like Robin was drowned/crushed, only for Strong's character to think he was killed so he decided to ride off in the sunset? Total nonsense. But something had to happen to get from point A to point 123, 2 minutes later. It sure wasn't a straight line though.But all in all, I think Crowe did the best he could given his forte and the script handed to him. Ridley Scott is just losing it. Shame on him for wasting millions of dollars and suckering in countless people to watch nothing but confusing and hacked movies. He really needs to learn what real storytelling is about, or retire until a decent script comes his way.",Robin Hood
275,Amonute-Matoaka,"Too many cooks, apparently.",6,3 November 2018,"So, it seems this film was a nightmare to make. I actually read the original script, titled ""Nottingham"", a story in no way recognisable in the finished film. An occurrence common enough in Hollywood, but perhaps not with such dramatic changes of writers, or so inconsiderate spendings.What surprised me is that the final script is actually much more mature, less cliche, had more potential than the original one, even though that was the one considered unconventional. Scott was right in persisting that the story had to be fixed. But, by the time they realised that, the production had already stretched, and so,having run out of time, they went with sloppiness which, of course, shows.This film starts strong, but sags and limps towards a tepid ending. It would have been saved if it's realism had persisted, or if it had something new to tell us. It did none of those things and thus, a 200 million dollars production turned into a sorry meh.",Robin Hood
276,pascaloetterli,I've rarely been face palming so often in the movies such as in this Robin Hood – still I liked it a bit,4,27 June 2010,"At the beginning I was stunned by a nice interpretation of a legendary king and I expected to see more of this ""truer"" medieval scenery and history. Yet things went downhill really fast. It is OK, to evoke images of ""The longest day"", ""The golden age"", ""Braveheart"" in one's mind. The problem is, you fight with those in your mind and you realize the stupidity of many aspects. I laughed, rolling my eyes a lot. There was no hint of irony, and by this complete disastrous interpretation of English history, irony would have been important. So there's a new Robin Hood, and his quest was not revenge – thankfully – but his new task is by no means better than the classic one(help the poor, fight the rich and the bad). The scenery is nice, there are fine displays of a medieval feeling, yet there is such a bad main plot, which no one is going to take seriously. Why would one write such a travesty of pseudo-historical events and still hope people would want to watch this? It is replacing of old fashioned (false) images with even worse new ones. The cast was OK, but having seen Maximus and Elizabeth already, I think it would have been better to bring other actors for those crucial parts. Prince John looked too Mediterranean and seemed so exaggerated like the Sheriff, Godfrey and all the displayed French. I also don't know why no one employs a genuine British cast. There must clearly be some kind of arrogance having English medieval ages always played by anyone but Brits, can't help it there. So, no complete disaster? No, for my behalf, I was just too eager to see swords, bows, armor and horses in a theatre again and so should you. Don't expect a Robin Hood movie, it isn't. Don't expect historical correctness, it is only found in some scenery and some equipment. There's clearly better work of Mr. Scott and his cast, and still there's a chance you may like that movie, it is just much smaller than most other medieval films of the last twenty or so years.",Robin Hood
277,AndrePhilidor,Skip this movie!,2,16 May 2010,"The only positive thing I can say about this film is the excellent production and filming. What a melange of near incomprehensible accents! Russell Crowe - Australian, Cate Blanchett - Australian, Max von Sydow - Scandinavian. Much of the dialogue is barely intelligible. The lines spoken in French had subtitles (the only lines I could understand with my high school French!). This is unlike any Robin Hood you may have seen before. Of course there was only ONE Robin Hood - Errol Flynn. All others are only feeble imitations. The battle scenes were impressive. But Robin fighting with a long handled hammer??? Admittedly it was effective against the helmeted French, but, as I said, unlike any other Robin Hood. And the landing craft for the French Fleet? Did they buy discarded WWII LST's used to land our Allied Forces on Normandy Beach? Overly long, overly talky, they could have talked the French to death. Definitely a disappointment and, in my book (and my wife's) not worth seeing. At least Mel Brooks' version ""Men in Tights"" gave us a few laughs.",Robin Hood
278,JeffersonCody,Rather disappointing.,6,17 May 2010,"""Robin Hood"" (2010): (Rating: An extremely generous 6 out of 10).""Robin Hood"" plays like a supposedly commercially cunning stylistic cross between ""Gladiator"", ""Saving Private Ryan"" and ""Batman Begins"". Okay, so it's a prequel, an origin story and Sir Ridley and Russell obviously hope it will be the first part of a trilogy. Shame on them. Do they need the money so badly? Ignoring the heart and soul of an enduring and inspiring romantic legend, these buggers have aimed their arrows squarely at the wallets of the mass market and gone for the lowest common denominator. One film pleases all, so to speak. And sadly, a lot of undiscriminating modern cinema-goers will enjoy what they have served up.The new ""Robin Hood"" was, for me, a bitterly disappointing film and, with a running length of nearly 150-minutes, a sometimes boring one too. It's big and sprawling, and, with Sir Ridley at the helm, it is certainly well made on a technical level. But does it have heart and soul and emotion and a stirring story? No ways. After about 120 long minutes we get the French invading Britain in an expensive, GGI-laden action sequence which seems to have been inspired by the Normandy landing scenes in ""Saving Private Ryan"". What it is this? Sir Ridley's homage to the Spielberg flick. Only, instead of machine gun bullets tracing through the water as soldiers stumble across the sand at the bottom of the sea trying to avoid a rain of death, it is arrows.Then, five minutes before the picture ends, the story I wanted to see finally arrives on the screen. But shorty after this, the words ""And so the legend begins"" appear, and the movie ends.I'm a fan of Russell Crowe and I thoroughly his performances in films such as ""Romper Stomper"", ""LA Confidential"", ""Gladiator"", ""Master and Commander: The Far Side of the World"", ""Cinderella Man"", ""The Insider"" and ""The Sum of Us"". Hell, i even enjoyed his work in ""State of Play"" and the remake of ""3.10 to Yuma"".But his surly Robin Longstride, the man who will perhaps - if this picture makes enough money to allow the sequel to be made - become the Robin Hood we know and love, is not one of his finest screen moments. The character is merely another figure in a sprawling cinematic landscape created by Sir Ridley. He never registers on an emotional level, and Crowe,IMO, despite looking fairly buff, is too old for the part. What a waste of a good actor.Blanchett, who I also enjoy, fares slightly better, but she is miscast in an underwritten role. Her Maid Marion is an interesting creation, but we never get to now her well enough. Even the Sheriff of Nottingham (an ineffectual Matthew Macfadyen - looking like a chubby version of Dermot Mulroney) is a minor character in the picture.In the supporting cast, Mark Strong - as the wicked Godfrey, and Max Von Sydow as the blind Sir Walter Loxley, have their moments, and Eileen Atkins is good in her few scenes. Then there are Mark Addey (Friar Tuck) and Kevin Durand ( Little John) who are, I presume, supposed to be the comic relief. Not that I laughed much. Danny Huston doesn't exactly shine as King Richard the Lionheart either. And William Hurt is wasted as William Marshal.I saw ""Robin Hood"" in South Africa. The cinema was surprisingly full and the multiplex mob seemed to enjoy the film. But I found it an utter disappointment, It didn't stir me, it didn't amuse me and it didn't thrill me. And I'm usually quite easily to please. ""Robin Hood"" is nothing more than an expensive attempt to steal from the poor and desperate (cinemagoers), who will go looking for spectacle and excitement in all the wrong places. Isn't a film like this supposed to bring joy to the poor and downtrodden.It seems as if they wanted to pull in the ""Gladiator"" crowd. But that was silly because this film suffers hugely by comparison, as does Crowe's performance.Watching this version of the tale, only made me ache for Errol Flynn and Olivia De Havilland in ""The Adventures of Robin Hood"", now that was a Robin Hood picture. ""Robin and Marion"", the Lester flick, was also more romantic than this current version. Hell, even the Costner version was more fun. Boo.While I didn't enjoy ""Robin Hood"", it still looks likely to pull in about $300 worldwide, so sequels could still be on the cards. In my heart of hearts, however - and it pains me to say this, I hope it does not do sufficient numbers to generate sequels.I saw ""Robin Hood"" a day after watching Miley Cyrus in ""The Last Song"". So I thought, how bad can it be?"" Sir Ridley, Cate, Russell in warrior mode. it can only be an improvement on The Last Song"". Sadly, it wasn't. At least ""The Last Song"" was shorter.If anybody with a passion for cinema lusts to see this film, I would suggest they wait for the DVD release, and then approach it with low expectations. Very low expectations! I suppose the upside is that I didn't have to pay to watch the film. But even that brings me little cheer.",Robin Hood

Stupid scenes with daft music forcing to dramatise really insignificant sub stories, such as the returning of the sword? Stupid scenes of Robin hood shouting NNNNNNNOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!!!!!!!!!! near the end of the film that had no place being there.

This is very annoying. They could have just called it 'A commoner nobly rallies the Barons and saves England from the French"", but, alas, they would've had problems with that too. A) They fictionalize most of the facts about King John and King Philip, and B) the audience for flicks about English squabbles between King and Barons, and even the French, don't sell well.Of course, Robin Hood is a fictional character. So, throw his name in there, re-write English history and add a woman doing something implausible and silly (really, showing up for battle against a French army and mounted knights leading a bunch of teens on Shetland ponies?) If they hadn't tried to tie it to Robin Hood and faked pivotal events of English history and a document vital to all western peoples, the Magna Carta, I might give if a 5 or 6 just on popcorn value and top actors. But, now all we will have is a generation of teens that are confused about both the myth of Robin Hood and a turning point in western democracy, the Magna Carta. Boo Hollywood. If you want to make a period piece from the time of King John and the Magna Carta, do it. Or Robin Hood. But both? A low even by money-is-king Hollywood biz standards.",Robin Hood

The movie drifts greatly from the tale of Robin hood whose character is take money from rich and distribute to the poor. This characteristic element was completely missing from the movie. Robin hood is portrayed as a knight rather than thief. It can compared to portraying James Bond as a basketball player rather than a spy.The movie reminds me of the movie gladiator, rather than that of Robin Hood. No wonder, it is by Ridley Scott and Russell Crowe. The movie becomes too slow in the middle and drags at snails pace. The scenes seems like fillers rather than anything to develop. The lead female character played by Cate Blanchette is completely undeveloped and is just there for sake of it. The plot seems like designed from the sequel point of view. It has few good action scenes and costumes. However the weak story line causes the movie to fail completely.",Robin Hood

I viewed the Blu Ray Director's cut,perhaps the theatrical version being shorter would have given the story more pace.At times it was hard to follow.The film had its moments with some good CGI but alas not enough to warrant the hype or the budget.Perhaps as I have read elsewhere this is merely laying the ground for a sequel 'Robin Hood The Legend begins' or some such.Like my old school reports,I would say to those involved 'Can do better'.",Robin Hood

The film starts with some good action in France and the first 15 minutes are well done.After that, with the return of Robin to England, the movie slows down a lot and basically nothing interesting happens for the next 90 minutes. Lots of talking, some plots unfold, but all in all only ho-hum. Nothing to write home about. I espected more action and especially more suspense in a film about Robin HoodThen the last 20 minutes the film picks up speed again and has a nice final battle on a beach. But what were the ""feral boys"" suddenly doing there with Maid Marian? That was silly and never explained.All in all, the film doesn't play in the same league as ""Gladiator"", although Crowe and Scott are involved again. Crowe shows a solid performance, but nothing memorable. The film shows some great locations and sets, but doesn't do much with it.The villain is well played by Marc Strong, but criminally underused, and the final showdown between him and Robin Hood is a huge letdown compared to ""Gladiator"".Personally, I rate this film 5/10.

The story in which Robin Hood in disguise participated in a Bow and Arrow shooting contest was completely left out. The majority of the movie production employed hundreds of extras in several battle scenes that I think were totally irrelevant to Robin Hood's folklore, and explains why did the production's initial cost was 200 Million Dollars. Once again, Hollywood writers and producers assumed that the movie viewing public are ignorant of history as they rewrote history and made a new story about Robin Hood that really did not show the true character of this legendary man and his Merry Men. Finally, the closing of the movie was yet another let down as the new King, whose Army beat a French invasion, was not credited with the victory but Robin Hood was, and for this the King declared him an outlaw!

WHY? why would they make the boats look like that? Someone else likened them to WWII carriers and I have to say I totally agree. That was the only thing I kept thinking during that scene. Normally something that trivial would not bother me, but in this case I felt like it was over-shadowing what was going on in the scene. I just kept thinking ""who designed those ridiculous-looking boats?"". A couple other things about that scene started bothering me after that but nothing worth mentioning. Honestly, it was a really good movie and I liked how it ended. I'm hoping they have already started making a second one (with a little more time-period accuracy).There isn't any sexually explicit material (no mention of it at all really, except for a couple of suggestive bar maids who don't even show any skin or anything).The language isn't bad, that I remember. Just a few mild curse words here and there (but these are men in battle after all).The violence is really not horrible. A ton of people getting killed with arrows and some sword fighting, etc. But probably a third to half of the movie is battle scenes so it's to be expected.Overall, I think it's an accurate PG-13.",Robin Hood

The preview looked fantastic but every review I'd read said essentially the same thing.... Gladiator was so much better.Shocking revelation.... this movie is not Gladiator. Forget gladiator. This is Robin Hood.Now upon it's own merit, I give this movie an eight or eight point five, not a ten. I voted ten because it has been trashed by people starring it at a one or two. Fact is the movie is really very good, there is a semi-complex intrigue mixed with a kind of wonder at how the man Robin Hood got his name, outlaw status, enemies, and allies. Crowe does a fantastic job acting along side a great cast of believable characters that really do seem like they could be the real life counterparts to the beloved characters we remember from previous films and books. The action is not non-stop, don't go to this movie expecting an array of massive battles, one after another and you should be fine.Bottom line: The movie is fun, entertaining, and made a great theater experience for me. No it's not set in a gladiatorial arena but if you're not looking for Roman soldiers you'll find an engaging, original take on an old character. If you don't see it in the theaters, at least rent it, this movie is very much worth it.",Robin Hood
289,hpipik,Opportunity Missed,5,29 October 2010,"The movie is beautiful: Russel Crowe swinging a sword (or shooting an arrow, or something) and, God knows, you could do much worse than watching Cate Blanchette for 2 hrs. But the story of Robin Hood is completely re-told, and not in a good way.There is no one story of Robin Hood, it is a collection of legends. The premise of all the legends, however, is Anglo-Saxon resistance to their Norman conquerors. The vision of the writers and director of this movie is fully revealed at the very end when Marian speaks approvingly of living in the forest as outlaws, saying, ""No tax, no tithe, nobody rich nobody poor, fair shares for all at nature's table."" In other words, the writers see Robin Hood as a socialist parable rather than the nationalist one everybody else took it for, all these long centuries.Indeed, you feel the socialist sensibility throughout the movie, beginning with its hard imitation of the miserable ""A Knight's Tale"", in which a commoner impersonates a knight, and gets away with it. In this movie, Robin Hood is a yeoman who impersonates a knight, then actually impersonates a son and husband. How so? Well, it seems his father was a visionary stone-mason who made a big impression on Sir Walter Loxley, the socman of Nottingham, and single-handedly rallies a divided nation against yet another French invasion...Really, I can't go on, it's just too preposterous.My first premonition of a movie that steps out of imagination into the absurd was very early on, when Robin tells his king, Richard, that God is not pleased with Richard's Crusade because of the massacre Richard committed at Acre. This is pretty good, until Robin explains that he knew it had all gone horribly wrong when, about to murder a young woman, the woman looks up at him and he sees pity in her eyes. Yes, you see, the woman who is about to be murdered pities her murderer---because he thereby becomes ""Godless"". Is this the kind of thought going through the mind of a person about to be murdered? Maybe, if that person is a saint. Otherwise, I don't think so.But wait, it gets worse. The point of this little episode is to reveal that Richard The Lion-Heart was, in his own way, as big a bastard as his notoriously bastard brother, John. And the point of that is to show that there can be no salvation, for the common man, in kings. According to Ridley Scott and his writers, a classless society, living on Nature's bounty, in the forest, is the only way. Where is George Orwell when you need him?Finally, I love Cate Blanchette so it pains me to say this, but she is a tad old to play Maid Marion. Although, in this telling of the story, Marion is no maiden. Bah! I should knock off another rating star just for that.",Robin Hood
290,gaiter88,A good start to what will hopefully be a great series!,9,20 May 2010,"Just come back from watching this at the cinema, and I was pleasantly surprised. For a child of the nineties who grew up on watching Prince of Thieves I was hoping for something completely different, and I was disappointed.Perhaps the most interesting thing about this film is it predecessors, because together with it they provide an interesting chronicle into the development of film over the last 70 odd years. Indeed Hollywood has come a long way within the last 20 years alone. This film may lack a lot of that nineties over sentimentality, an evil witch, half buttoned pristine white shirts, a cameo from the then god Sean Connery and a Canadian with and electric guitar in the credits, but that doesn't mean it is better or indeed worse.What this film provides for me is a more realistic and in many ways subtler feel to this very English legend. I think the casting of such an internationally flavoured cast with a sprinkling of some genuine English talent was a master stroke. I liked the cinematography, especially the battle scenes which seemed chaotic and rushed, which to me makes for a more realistic experience. The script was a script but did not drop the ball, and the sets and locations were all very convincing.Most importantly though I think that Crowe pulls of Robin. Unlike KC attempt he does and gets the English accent well. He brings just the right levels of drama and humour to the role and most important of all, and perhaps something the previous occupants of the metaphorical green tights did not have, he looks like the sort of chap who would have been on and survived the crusades, could command a group of unruly men, and doesn't mind slumming it in a forest for a bit. It is strange because I never use to rate him that highly, but I think that this and some of his other recent work is starting to really show how he is maturing into one of the bes actors of his generation.In summary then this is a good film, definitely warranting the price of the cinema ticket. I look forward to a sequel, if there is one which the end would suggest there might. But don't try and compare it to Prince of Thieves because they're two different genres of film. At its heart this film is an action drama, but a small sprinkling of romantic and comedy sub plots turns it away from a Gladiatoresk hard core mans man film into something that everyone (over 12) can enjoy.N.B. just as an aside he may have only had a small role but once again Douglas Hodge really shone out for me in this film, it amazes me why he does not get more film roles, perhaps he is too busy with theatre?",Robin Hood
291,momosity,Gladiator 2 It Ain't,2,7 August 2013,"Seriously--I know Ridley Scott and Russell Crowe have this big bromance thing, but this was a huge waste of time, and of course, there was a hint at a sequel towards the end. No need for that.Spare me! I only watched this because of the supporting cast: Max von Sydow, Mark Addy, Kevin Durant, etc. Russell Crow and Cate Blanchett made for a boring couple. Mark Strong is getting way too over-played as the annoying villain. I don't need to hear the venerable Max von Sydow make another dick joke, thank you very much.

293,urbanlegend23,"Visually handsome and not without some well-executed sequences, but overall one of Scott's lesser pictures.",6,17 September 2011,"""Robin Hood"" is a bit of a letdown for fans of Ridley Scott and Russell Crowe's previous collaborations, especially the great ""Gladiator"" which is its closest cousin. Crowe's performance never projects the same animalistic intensity he gave to Maximus in that film, and as a result his Robin Hood is somewhat bland. Not to mention his all-over-the-place Irish (?) accent seems to change by the scene. The love story he shares with Cate Blanchett feels very by-the-numbers and overall it's totally unconvincing. Both actors fail to create a spark of chemistry with the other, and the movie works better when they are apart. Blanchett, when she's given the opportunity to take centre stage away from her dull romantic story with Crowe, emerges as the best part of the film. It's odd that she steals the lion's share of the memorable scenes, given that the story revolves mostly around Crowe's titular hero. In a scene where her village is set upon by vicious pillagers and she is nearly raped, Blanchett is so good you'll almost want to cheer for her. This entire sequence is worth mentioning as it's the film's highlight. If the rest of the film had been this emotional, Scott might've been onto a winner.This is a Ridley Scott production, so the mise-en-scene is typically spot-on, and it's visually handsome throughout. The cinematography captures the vast landscapes of the period beautifully, and brings intensity to the multiple battle sequences.Scott clearly sets the stage for a sequel with his final scene, and if it ever emerges (which based on the so-so critical reaction, it won't) you'd hope he spends less time on the muddled plot and expositionary dialogue, which could take up probably 1/3 of this effort and bogs down the finished product considerably. If it had the sense of adventure the legend is known for, this might be a character I'd look forward to revisiting. Perhaps in this film Scott has chosen to take his source material far too seriously.It's one of Scott's least enjoyable films to date, though worthy of checking out for a couple of undeniably powerful moments and the beautiful visuals. Just don't expect ""Gladiator"".",Robin Hood
294,Palidan400,Robin Hood is Good,8,15 May 2010,"Ridley Scott and Russell Crowe team up again and prove another worthy combination. Robin Hood has story, action, and acting, and is an interesting and great movie to watch.I'll be comparing this to Iron Man 2 since I just watched both, but in general, the lower scores for this movie might come from the fact that this isn't like Iron Man. It's not exactly pure fun and enjoyment, but it's more serious and realistic, and the most realistic Robin Hood film in my opinion.The main protagonists Robin and Marion, played by Russell Crowe and Cate Blanchett respectively, both play their parts very well. They fit perfectly. Crowe already has experience in these types, and with Ridley Scott in the epic Gladiator, and he continues those roles. Blanchett I believe also has experience in these roles, such as in Lord of the Rings.The action was there, believe it or not, and it was done well. It didn't rely on blood or explosions (there were explosions though, heh), and the violence is shown through suspense and emotions. Some people are disappointed since there wasn't too much action, and that's true. But if you're expecting a war-movie, that's a wrong expectation. Robin Hood even in the past was never about all out fighting, but more about the characters, story, and theme. In my opinion, this film can be more of a drama, too. So, don't go in expecting a violent, action movie, and you will enjoy this prequel to the legend of Robin Hood.",Robin Hood
295,timsmith37,Nottingham-on-Sea,4,15 January 2017,"There is no one Robin Hood story, just an accretion of folk tales, antiquarian speculation and literary invention. The Saxons versus Norman theme was an anachronism that originated with Sir Walter Scott. The story can legitimately be set in the time of Richard and John, of Simon de Montfort or of any of the first three Edwards. Robin can be a yeoman, as in the ballads, or he can be an earl fallen on hard times, as the Elizabethan playwrights had it. He can inhabit the realm of history or, increasingly in modern retellings, that of fantasy. He can be a merry trickster or a grim guerrilla fighter. The only constant is that Robin Hood is an outlaw. Except in this version. Well not until the last five minutes, anyway. This it is claimed is an origin story: the story of how the Robin became an outlaw. The problem is that the actor playing Robin is too long in the tooth for a prequel, why he is outlawed is never really made clear and the plot, such as it is, has no particular connection to any story element associated with Robin Hood. Just a few characters with the same names. Not that Robin himself is ever actually called Robin Hood.So what is this film? An action adventure story, in which playing fast and loose with history can be excused because we are on a helter skelter ride of thrills? Nah, it is far too plodding for that. An historical drama then? Well in that case some grounding in real events seems to be a prerequisite. I don't really know where to start on the historical inaccuracies. But let's start right at the start. Richard did not die on his return from the crusades, he had already been back to England and was campaigning to secure his lands in France. The castle he invested at Chalus-Chabrol was defended by just forty men of whom only two had real any military training. But Ridley Scott needs to reassure the audience that this is going to be a full-blooded epic (because the next hour and a half is going to be really dull) so the siege becomes a major production number with Richard struck down in the thick of the frantic action. Rather than, as history records, being hit by a lucky potshot and lingering on to die of gangrene in his mother's arms. After that, well actually after that any resemblance to history flies out of the window, with vague, incoherent references to Magna Carta and the First Baron's War being tossed into a stew of anachronistic ingredients that barely bubbles to a simmer. For me the most precious moment was when the turncoat Godfrey begins speaking to Phillipe Augustus in French, and the King says, 'In English, please.' The King of England couldn't speak English let alone the King of France!Okay, you can rely on the average audience having a tenuous grasp on English history, English audiences not least, but this is the most geographically challenged Robin Hood film since Kevin Costner took the rolling English road to Nottingham by way Hadrian's Wall. Or perhaps the producers of this film had a different Nottingham in mind, since the Nottingham here appears to be a seaside Hampshire village rather than a heavily fortified midland stronghold.Some effort is made to get the material culture correct, but it always bemuses me when the producers of historical dramas lavish immense care and cost on authentic costumes and set dressing, and the script is then entrusted to a hack who can't be bothered to do even the most basic Ladybird book level research. Having the peasants playing Celtic folk rock at their celebration did in any case rather detract from the carefully constructed medieval ambiance.So we have a story not set in real time, not set in the real world and not grounded in myth. Just a jumble of badly integrated plot elements, topped and tailed with some tacked on action sequences.It is a film without point, without purpose, without soul.",Robin Hood
296,MikeNTxs,This Is Not The Myth You're Looking For,10,15 September 2019,"If this is the first thing you read, take my advice: until you have watched the movie, don't read the reviews (except maybe this one) and don't read the trivia. That will only spoil the movie for you.And there is a teeny tiny maybe-spoiler in the last sentence. I'll warn you.I rarely give less than a 5 (Meh. They tried and it could've been worse) or more than a 9 (Nothing is perfect), but I'm giving this film a 10.Why?Viewing time is precious, and I'm always in a state of triage on my DVR. After putting off this film for literally weeks, being attracted only by bits I'd glimpsed while scanning movie channels, I found it to be surprisingly gripping and a surprisingly speedy 140 minutes.It is a total re-imagining of the legend in which only characters may be familiar. I think this is the source of the most negative reviews. So, if you're looking for a traditional telling, gird your loins for something completely different.For me this was not a bad thing. It meant that every predictable turn of the tale was actually not. I found myself enjoying that frequent surprise.Many reviews talk about this actor's range being limited or that actor being under-utilized. I would ignore that.I'm my opinion, this movie does what a movie should do. It engages the viewer from the start, because it starts in unexpected ways. It tells a familiar myth in ways that are unexpected but not off-putting. It ends in a small surprise. (This is why many reviewers ravage the last 20-30 minutes).Is the movie flawed? Certainly. Some historical liberties taken? Sure.Is it fun in startling ways and an overall i regretted way to spend that140 Minutes? Absolutely. And that's why I'm giving it a 10.Suspend your disbelief and have a good time.The spoiler? Next line.It sets itself up for a potential sequel.",Robin Hood
297,airguitar57,"Shhh...you're so pretty, don't talk",7,19 June 2010,"Ridley Scott returns to familiar territory with Robin Hood. Obviously comfortable in the period setting of the film, Scott looks to reignite the flame of good old Mr. Hood. The story, more a reimagining than a retelling, is a weak point in a film that succeeds in taking the audience on an entertaining ride.Robin Hood takes a cue from Batman Begins and Casino Royale, and looks to provide an origin story. Starting on the field of battle, Robin Longstride (Russell Crowe) is an archer in King Richard the Lionheart's (Danny Huston) English army. Following a successful day of battle, Robin unwinds with his compatriots Will Scarlet (Scott Grimes), Allan A'Dayle (Alan Doyle) and Little John (Kevin Durand). After Robin reveals his true thoughts concerning the Crusade to the King himself, Robin, Will, Allan and John land in the stocks and are forced to sit out the next day's battle. During the battle, the King catches an arrow in the throat and before dying entrusts the return of his crown to Sir Robert Loxley (Douglas Hodge). Robin and his men are freed from the stocks by a young boy and set out to return home. At the same time, the King of France plots to conquer England by enlisting the help of Sir Godfrey (Mark Strong). Godfrey, an Englishman with French allegiance, along with a horde of French soldiers ambush the Royal Guard. Robin and his men happen upon the ambush as it occurs and fight back, killing many while Godfrey escapes. Robin goes to Sir Robert Loxley whose last dying wish is for his sword to be returned to his father. The film then follows Robin as he returns to Loxley's home of Nottingham with the impending French onslaught looming over England's shoulder.The story of Robin Hood can be complicated, and unnecessarily so. To rewrite such a classic story is a daunting task, one that should only be done with good reason, something the film fumbles in trying to present. The beginning of the film sets itself up to craft a different story, giving the audience hope, but becomes tired of the task and takes an easier and more predictable path. Characters are quickly introduced and rarely given depth. I imagined at one point that the writers had a Robin Hood checklist that they were going down during their process; Little John, check, Friar Tuck, check, Sheriff of Nottingham, check. In the way of story, the film brings nothing new to the table.There are few who can do a period piece as well as Ridley Scott. Having already proved himself with Gladiator and Kingdom of Heaven, Scott continues to show his cinematic eye for this genre. With the help of cinematographer, and frequent Scott collaborator, John Mathieson, the film is shot to make you feel the landscape. Each shot has such an authenticity that the audience can nearly smell the earthiness of old England. Then Scott stages action scenes amongst this terrain. If I could ask one thing of the film, it would be for more action scenes. Almost balletic in their presentation, both swords and arrows grab you by the throat and refuse to let go until the battle is over. This may not be your favorite Robin Hood, but it is without a doubt the most exciting.Although it suffers from a lackluster story and nearly non-existent character development, Robin Hood is no waste. Shot in such a way that suggests a true love of the period, the film will consistently keep your eyes interested. Scott shows artistry in his composure of action, if only there were more of it. Robin Hood has its faults but never fails to entertain.",Robin Hood
298,RamblerReb,A strong start gives way to an unmitigated mess.,3,19 April 2011,"First, the good: the costumes, the set design, the locations, Max Von Sydow, and Cate Blanchett.The bad: virtually everything after Russell Crowe invades Merry Olde England.I didn't finish the film (I watched an old Dean Martin western instead, right after the scene where Crowe starts haranguing King John and the barons about signing the Constitution-- er, the Magna Carta), so maybe it got better, but the wretched heavy-handedness was making my gorge rise.If you stick to the bits with Blanchett and Von Sydow (not counting the awful childhood flashback scene he seemed embarrassed to be in), it's passable. Otherwise, it's a waste of time and the power it takes to run the video system to watch it.",Robin Hood
299,b_clerkin,Throw Out Your Books,8,14 May 2010,"If you want to see the new version of ""Robin Hood"" directed by Ridley Scott and produced by Imagine Entertainment, with Brian Grazer leading, take the advice Cate Blanchett (Marian) implied during interviews at Cannes and do not look at this film an historic record. Any actual resemblance to recorded fact, or even legend, is accidental. So if you want to enjoy this old time movie, then forget everything you've ever learned about the legend of Robin Hood, British or European history during the late 12th and early 13th centuries, because it will make you nuts. Fortunately, forewarned by Ms. Blanchett (reviewers seem less critical of the gross failings at historic accuracy)I expected fantasy, and I got it, from the very first scene, where the death of Richard is accurate only in the circumstances of the wound that caused it.The story twists time, placing the activities of Hood after the death of Richard, with the first attempts at the Magna Carta (who knew Robin played so significant a role?) and a fictitious invasion of Dover by King Philip of France thrown in for entertainment purposes - and it works because the battle scenes at the legendary White Cliffs are thrilling. Ignoring the fact that Richard, John and most of the Norman nobility spoke French rather than English, the film has subtitles only where actual French people speak - they simply should not have bothered with the French at all, as it was kind of jarring. Rather than have Robin Hood as the outlawed Earl of Huntingdon, Robert Loxley, the writers made him an archer(the son of a stone mason cum philosopher) who fought in Acre with Richard, and who assumes the dying Loxley's identity after that knight is ambushed in France while taking Richard's crown back to London. Hood's prowess as an archer is ignored as he plays at being a mounted knight, but pops up for significant incidents. His pals are there, Marian, Little John, Tuck, Alan a Dale, Will Scarlet and the Sheriff of Nottingham, but only Tuck and Little John are recognizable from legend. The Sheriff, is a bit of a joke and the talented Matthew MacFadyen is wasted - one wonders what he could have done with a more traditional characterization of the role. The final scene with Prince John must have been designed by a fan of the Disney cartoon version of the legend, because his crown is identical to that worn by the lion Prince John in that film.Now that I have whined about the egregious errors, I can tell you that the acting is uniformly excellent, with Blanchett's Marian and Crowe's Robin generating actual chemistry. Other actors are almost perfectly cast, particularly Mark Addy as Tuck, Kevin Durand as Little John and Oscar Isaac as King John. Mark Strong keeps the villainous Godfrey just this side of Snidely Whiplash. Gerard McSorely, who portrays a northern lord angry at the King, played a similar role in Showtime's series ""The Tudors"" which is not quite as historically inaccurate. The pacing is brisk - the two and a half hours zipped by. The special effects and scenery are wonderful (note, do not wear chain mail while at sea) and the action sequences robust and exciting without being excessively gory.The story - ah, the story - is one that any elected official or person in a position of power should watch. The Democrats in this country should pray that the Tea Partiers ignore it as more Hollywood liberal polemic, because its theme reads like a Tea Party manifesto. It might have started out as the typical Left Coast narrative - with mention being made by King John about fortunes having been spent on wars engaged in by his predecessor - but times have changed and its larger message of rulers oppressively taxing subjects who eventually must surrender everything to the state resonates like a massive gong in Grand Canyon, up to and including the portrayal of the arrogant ruler demanding loyalty and obedience from his subjects, alluding to the divinity of his position, and enraged at those who dare to disagree with his lofty opinion of himself and his ideology.",Robin Hood
300,dancemacabre,Simple Excellent and Beyond Expectation,9,30 November 2010,"New clip of the famous Ridley Scott looked after media pomp of this film and that was not excessive, at least not in a climate where I live. When it comes to adaptations of famous stories that have been previously recorded, then I rarely get a look at the motivation recycled adaptation. The motivation for the new Robin Hood is the main actor, Russell Crowe, who has always been dear to his acting and his approach to the heroic roles.And then, after watching each film, which is pretty epic two and a half hours I can say that my impression of the film far above expectations, no matter what is behind the camera as a proved and talented director. The movie is very authentic, well-acted, professionally recorded, and appears to cast Cate Blanchett, and William Hurt. Cate has already seen many times in similar films and hardly anyone can replace her in these types of films and so it is hard to imagine someone else. His role was expecting did well, but without the innovation standard.This film is not me at all really reminded me of past extensions of Robin Hood adventurer containing and comic elements. In this film, Russell Crowe is very much like William Wallace from Brave Heart, played by Mel Gibson and the film itself is visually very similar to the film.So, certainly I did not regretted two and half hours spent on this movie and have no serious objections because I did not expect too much. It is much better than similar films lately, such as Centurion and the Black Death with Sean Benn in a leading role. Do not miss the war scenes which are abundant, do not miss any romance or singing crazy songs of British and there are many brutal scenes that were not deprived of blood.Certainly recommend that you look at the film without too much thinking and compare.",Robin Hood

While not always historically truthful, he instead reaches to entertain and always has a unique vision of the myth or legend he attempts to portray.As an expert archer Robin Hood would not have been a knight but rather a yeoman and this insight set the flavor for Scott's version. And while the battles might not have been historically correct it IS true that France suffered it's greatest defeat to England due to the use of the longbow decimating the flower of French knighthood. All in all an interesting take on an old legend. Some will like it....some will prefer the traditional version.

If Little John, Will Scarlet and co are in the movie, please give them something meaningful to say. * Editing - I think the movie fell down in this area and the narrative seemed stunted and disjointed at times. Perhaps the material was not just there in the first place? * A lack of passion – Russell Crowe in particular was too low key in his role but was not the only one. And Russell, I did get confused at times as to what part of old England you came from. But there were some that put much more into it such as Cate Blanchett and Max Von Sydow (good to see this great old actor can still perform) and the movie did have many good points.

305,j1stoner,Making It Real,8,15 May 2010,"I see Ridley Scott's ""Robin Hood"" as continuing the project he started with ""Kingdom of Heaven"" in 2005; the attempt to de-mystify the legends of the medieval age, putting the naked brutality, injustice, and cruelty of period in clear view.Film allows total fancy and whimsy (for example the classic Errol Flynn version of ""Robin Hood""), but it can also make things concrete. Scott makes every effort to put us into that bygone world and see what it was like. It was ugly and savage, but it was also a world in which people had aspirations for justice and liberty. Scott places Robin Hood into a historical context which, if not factually accurate, at least gives a picture of the political realities of the times. So, it's serious, but also (much more than ""Kingdom of Heaven"") entertainment, with some good dialogue and more than a fair share of action.Some of the casting was very good, I think, especially Max von Sydow as Lady Marian's old, blind father, Danny Huston as King Richard the Lion-Hearted, and Kevin Durand as a very different kind of Little John, the warrior. Also, writer Brian Helgeland invented some good anecdotes of Robin's early associations with those who became his Merry Men, and came up with some straight-outta-modern dialogue between Robin and his lady as they initially battle, court (but not in the old-fashioned style), and love.As for the leads, Cate Blanchett's portrayal reminds me of many other feisty, down-to-earth Englishwomen, and I think it will be very popular.

I'm pretty sure that if Scott had the traditional vision of Robin Hood (see above), the critics would've criticized him because of his traditional vision of the main character, of the legend.

310,pcongleton-1,How do you make a Robin Hood who is less likable than the Sheriff of Nottingham?,6,23 May 2010,"From what research I did for this review it looks like Robin Hood was always a fictional character. That he arose from folklore and that every depiction of him since then has been different from the last one. So, there is no reason to worry about historical accuracy. With this film we take an approach that makes it almost seem like he wasn't even the guy we always thought he was. Without giving anything away, we are handed a guy, who depending on who you talk to, could appear to be a real jerk. He is an untrustworthy man. He is a character who is unlikeable and not really a hero. Fortunately for Robin, none of the characters in this film turn out to be likable characters. How do you manage to make a Robin Hood movie where Robin is more unlikeable than the Sheriff of Nottingham? The Sheriff was, at least, funny. But, it doesn't end there. I think Ridley Scott, in this being his 5th joint effort with Russell Crowe, tried to recapture the magic of Gladiator (2000), and I think that was the first problem. By trying to recapture that spark I think they made Russell Crowe's character too complex, they tried to human-ize him too much and it totally kills the character. At least his interactions with Marion (Cate Blanchett), are enjoyable, cute, humorous and poignant. Aside from that, I have always had problems with Ridley Scott films. I think his stuff looks great and sounds great, but is boring as hell. It never fails. They are tedious and way too long, in fact I thought Gladiator was good, but not Oscar material – no way, but then again, everybody can find movies on their list that shouldn't have won an Oscar. What we have here is the same old Ridley Scott venture where you see jaw-dropping scenes, but a film that is a snore-o-rama. We are handed a script that is disjointed, has some continuity issues and also makes no sense in some parts. The tediousness is inflated by the severe length. This film is by-lined as a prequel to the Robin Hood legend and when we get to the end we feel cheated, because you than say to yourself, ""that's the beginning""? Give me Kevin Cosner and The Prince of Thieves (1991), any day, which is one of my top 100 favorite movies of all time. Even Christian Slater's catapult-one-liner is better than some of the lines I heard in this one. I can't give it a ""D"" because it looks so good, but this should suffice.",Robin Hood
311,cortlahman,A Robbery in Itself,4,15 May 2010,"Can you blame a movie for trying to do so much but succeed at very little? Absolutely and Robin Hood deserves much negative criticism.Almost everything about Robin Hood was not very good. Battle scenes were so poorly portrayed as to leave you wondering why in god's name they opted to make this movie PG? Nothing was done right and the absence of gore in action scenes that had all the brutal elements for it was very annoying. Acting was nothing of noteworthiness and Russell Crowe and Cate Blanchett were sorely miscast for their roles.Robin Hood starts off easy with a good introduction to the main character, Robin Longstride. Sorry folks, he's only ever actually called something like Robin Hood once in the whole movie. However, the plot quickly starts to chug along and nothing really happens for about two hours. So many of the lore's important characters are stuffed into the fray that many don't get their dues. Where was the Sheriff of Nottingham for 98% of the film? Isn't he supposed to be the main antagonist? Spoilers Robin Hood has the worst end battle since Return of the Jedi's ewok catastrophe. We are seriously supposed to not think that Lady Marion and a bunch of young boys riding in on horseback and fighting a bunch of French invaders is anything but insanely moronic? In this day and age to show something like that to the viewer is just insulting.No level of sycophant could say this film was a good ""Robin Hood"" movie. It should have been called Robin Longstride. That would at least have given the viewer a hint he was watching a prequel and to start saving up for the inevitable next film.4/10, baby.",Robin Hood
312,KateC49,Very entertaining!,10,23 May 2010,"I want to say firstly that I hated 'Gladiator', so if I make any comparisons at all with this film it is against the other ""RH"" films & TV series that have gone before. Having read & seen some of the Plantagenet 12th/13th century history I found this story to be close enough to the historical mark to be very believable.One reviewer asked why we didn't know what happened to King John's first wife? The answer was in the film! John's stated intention of having that marriage annulled so he could marry Isabella was in fact what happened. It actually paid to have a few clues about this part of English history. The English baron's did finally force John to sign the Great Charter in 1215, which he then went back on his word (with the Popes agreement). Could Maid Marion have worn armour- well Joan of Arc did 200 years later..I found this to be a very entertaining, a well spun yarn, well cast & great acting by all, and at times some stunning locations/photography. Did this look like early 13th century England? Yes more so that in any other films I have seen in the past. I think it stands as the best Robin Hood film to date & Im ready for the next one. 10/10",Robin Hood
313,phoenix0879-1,"A nice idea, terribly executed",3,21 November 2015,"If one had to sum up Robin Hood in a single sentence, it would be ""failed to meet expectations"".A fresh retelling of the Robin Hood legend is always welcome, it's a timeless tale of heroics, love and standing up for what is right. But it needs to keep those three key elements - the dressing around it can change and be moulded to the needs of the story teller, but the three core principles have to be there. Without them, there is no Robin Hood.And that is the first of many errors here - the film doesn't feature love or much in the way of heroics. It does maintain the ""standing up for what is right"" ethos, after a fashion. But even then it's a stretch. Pretending to be a dead man so that his wife won't lose her home when her father in law dies, although kind of ""doing what is right"", loses it's nobility when you remember he cynically pretended to be this man half an hour earlier to save his own skin. Stripping dead soldiers to pass as them is hardly the heroic Robin Hood we all know from legend.The film makes the same error that King Arthur (2004) did - it tries to make a ""real"" story out of a myth and legend. Although nowhere near as utterly dreadful as King Arthur, the Robin Hood legend is one of larger than life heroics, selflessly doing the right thing and love and as such is one that is ill suited to a ""real world"" portrayal.Then there are the moments that make you go ""what?!"", such as 13th century France using landing vessels that would have been more at home in Saving Private Ryan or Marian randomly joining The Battle at the end (lets not even mention how the south coast is more than a few minutes ride from London, let alone Nottingham).A fresh retelling of a timeless legend, as I said before, is always a welcome prospect. However, this film does it so badly that you have to wonder why they bothered. 3 out 10, mainly for the locations - it is a visually impressive film - and an enjoyable opening battle.",Robin Hood

315,musings-morsels,Robin Hood - Fail!,4,19 May 2010,"Robin Hood; The untold story of the man behind the legend... A friend of mine came up with a much better tagline. Robin Hood: Gladiator with bows and arrows. The same prologue, director and actor were used but nowhere near the same quality. The piecemeal scenes of Robin Hood that tied the storyline together were confusing and disappointing. A lot of the dialogue that contributed to the overall plot line were unnecessary making the pace of the film appear choppy and condensed. So many ideas were brought into the story such as Robin's paternal origins and the significance of certain characters were never developed or explained. The angle the director took to move the plot along were to make all the characters seemed partial and easily swayed, a king's crucial decision for the future of this country made on a whim based on his mistress' word. There was no debate or friction intensity but a quick and easy dialogue delivery, like a bowl of uncooked instant noodles.In addition to the long winding war scenes, a large portion of the film danced around the romance between Marion (Blanchett) and Robin (Crowe), which was utterly excruciating to watch. The development of their growing love for each other was attempted through short awkward dialogue banter, only worsen by the lack of chemistry between the two actors. The fact that their mutual feelings were never addressed throughout the film made the declaration of love scene; come as a sudden shock. They were excellent apart but skin-crawling in the scenes they filmed together.Blanchett convincingly portrayed Marion as a strong, independent, hard headed woman throughout the film, however the useless addition of her running into the final battle with sword in hand & full body armour leading her small legion of the lost boys was completely unnecessary! Ridley Scott, you've been pounding it in our faces that Marion is a heroine from the start. We get it! She's tough! There was no need for her to join the battle and fail miserably. It completely undid her tough act and made the crucial farewell scene between Robin & herself obsolete. Although I have to give two thumbs up for the director of photography who made many of the sceneries appear absolutely breathtaking. The film overall, didn't bring anything new to the table of the already over-done Robin Hood legend.My favourite scene from this 2010 rendition of Robin Hood was when Marion and Robin decide to share some intimate and dramatic lip-locking action... amidst a raging battle! Marion who's fallen off her horse with heavy armour & is drowning/choking on the shore & Robin who's bleeding from the head comes to her rescue with blood dripping onto his lover's face; I ask this question. DO YOU REALLY THINK THIS IS THE BEST TIME TO BE MAKING-OUT?!? I don't know if this ""romantic"" scene trumps Elizabeth and Will's impromptu wedding ceremony/battle seen in Pirates of the Caribbean: At World's End. *gag*http://musingsandmorsels.weebly.com/",Robin Hood
316,ajfdomingo,Commendable on a Grand Scale,9,2 September 2010,"Ridley Scott stamps his trademark style of telling stories of larger than life heroes on a grand scale in the latest film on Robin Hood. Much attention is paid to convey the scale and ferocity of battle scenes that there is more than enough gore to make one flinch. The commendable trait of Scott is that he takes pains to develop the personal story of his lead character. It is as if he is doing a character study and inviting the audience to join him. Robin Hood clocks in at a relatively lengthy two hours and twenty minutes yet there are no scenes that can be called extraneous and that shows one more strength of a Ridley Scott film, good editing. The cast do a believable job of portraying life in medieval England and France, a feat that owes very much to the competence of the set and costume designers. I think this film is well worth the audience' time and money. It makes me hope that there will be a sequel soon.",Robin Hood

He stumbles into a quest to return the Sword of a fallen knight to it's rightful owner and also a Crown. the movie does not disappoint though the ending is a little bit too corny. A very strong cast of characters make a flawed script believable. And of course Marion and the Merry men come along for the ride. With a touch of the lost boys from Peter Pan.

The movie gives a sense of deja vu at best.We have seen it all.The ambushes in the forests, the medieval ships through the rough seas, the fights on the beaches, English countrysides and castles in all their glory and countryfolk working in the day and frolicking at night with no need to bathe. And then there's the fight.Add to all this bits of debatable history with a hint of crusades and some dollops of French to add authenticity and you get Robin all ready to fight for the downtrodden.If you are looking for your favourite Robin Hood characters and their exploits which you have read as a kid, the movie does'nt have much in store.Friar Tuck, Little John, the Sheriff of Nottingham all are there but not as you might have known them or wanted to see them.It's a Robin Hood prequel,this movie.Some of the scenes are spectacular no doubt, but it all seems so familiar.Anyways,no worries.We're all seeing too much of movies these days.",Robin Hood

What were they thinking about? Come on guys, a little historical research (even for a fantasy film like this) wouldn't have done any harm.This movie was a collection of nonsense from start to finish. OK, Robin Hood is a character from fiction and story tellers are at liberty to use this character as they wish but surely some historical context or realism are necessary to allow the suspension of belief? The French landing did not happen.Magna Carta is an important part of our history and should not be messed around like this.Don't get me started on the geographical screw-ups. Do the film makers have any idea how far it is from Nottingham to the South Coast? Or where the White Horse is? Idiots.But it is only a movie and I have been happy to sit through other films that have mangled history to a worse extent than this, so what was wrong? EVERYTHING! The script, the absence of plot, ludicrous casting, bizarre accents, poor lighting and cinematography, inaudible dialogue (thanks), unexplained background characters and hours and hours and hours of nothing happening all add up to a momentous car crash of a movie.Did I mention it was derivative? It stole the best parts of the Robin Hood legend, Saving Private Ryan, the Disney animated classic and Braveheart and wasted them.Do not waste your time on this or the inevitable sequel.",Robin Hood
321,zakfar2000,Is this a Robin Hood Movie?,1,20 September 2010,"I really surprised after watching this movie. I had not checked the reviews here before, and now when I do, especially the negative ones, I agree with most of them. It's just a waste! It indeed started good. With such a high-class casting and direction team, I was indeed expecting too much, may be. I got disappointed. Many flaws in the storyline, and worse characterization I have seen in high budget movies. The most important problem with the movie is that, the Robin Hood does not even prove to be the 'Robin Hood' that we know. He is supposed to be a great Archer. But more than his bow-capabilities, his fighting skills are dominated with other means. He is supposed to be a sneak fighter, mastered in Guerrilla tactics, rather than military actions. This is indeed not a Robin Hood Movie.OK! Some might say that as it's a prequel to the Robin Hood Character that we commonly refer to, it is like that. But when someone picks up a movie with the title, the closeness to the character in the mind of the viewer has to be taken at least little consideration. It can happen to many others, as it happened to me. Throughout the movie, I was waiting for the Robin Hood to become the Robin Hood, but he did not, and the movie ended. Alas! Such a good opportunity was wasted.I won't discuss all the movie flaws that have already been discussed here. Plenty of reviewers have made good lists. Check those. If you want to still watch the movie, do it at your own risk. After watching the movie, you might feel bad for Russell Crowe & Ridley Scott, who have presented this disappointing performance here.I wanted to give it 1/10.

""The Story Behind the Legend."" Robin Hood is truly epic in every way.The acting was perfect. I couldn't have asked for a better performance for any of the actors/actresses. You will love some characters and hate some and your opinion will change throughout the movie about some of the characters. However, very few of the characters were introduced in a way that I understood them, they were just fleshed out as the movie went on.The battle scenes were epic, but they were lacking the brutality that made Gladiator's battles so much more epic. Sometimes I felt that the exact sword slashes were used multiple times, but overall the battles felt intense and exciting.I would highly recommend this to anyone, especially Ridley Scott fans.

It doesn't take away from the story unless you know this and then you start wondering what else they took license with.
Anyway. Russell Crowe is always brooding and does these sword fight movies well. And I would watch Cate Blanchett paint a wall. Sigh. And Oscar Isaac is a good Prince John.

We all have loved Robin for being the outlaw who is the quintessential underdog, the one who loves to rob the rich and give to the poor, for his band of brothers and their camaraderie.. However this back to the future is set against the backdrop of 12th century politics of England and the struggle for power between Richard the Lion heart and his brother John with the French powers thrown into the mix.. So for those reasons this does not give you the tale that we have grown to love and so you end up being exposed to a watered down Braveheart, or a kingdom of heaven.. Ridely Scott does deliver the goods when it comes to production values of authentic props, extracting solid yet uninspiring performance from the actors.. However there are hardly moments that you take away from the movie hall, very few goosebumps from arrows hitting the mark, and no anticipation as you watch frame after frame.. Possibly the script needed to have lot more intensity, be more taut if one were to focus on Robin before he became an outlaw as this is virgin territory..

Before I nodded off all I remember was this: They try a total new story on the legend, which leaves out all the clichés like the bow and arrow competition in disguise. But hello, this wants to be a summer blockbuster, so some clichés are welcome! It has a multi-million dollar budget so don't Dostojewski me!But while the story of Robin Hood was successfully extended with a pre story in the 1991 Costner flick, this time everything is out of place. You're wondering when he's finally gonna set up his den in the woods but instead Robin gets ""married"" to Lady Marion after twenty minute while the sheriff of Nottingham is on the margin.It tries not to tell the same story again, OK, but it's so out of place that you must start searching for the main villain which kills the excitement. In the end (I woke up again due to the noise of what seemed like the climatic battle) it turns out to be a massive pre-story of how Robin Longstride becomes Robin Hood aiming for a sequel.

Good film but not the best of R. Scott, as my favourite director.

If, however, you go to the movies to see something exciting and your definition of exciting is not something you've seen 100 times before, then you will be extremely disappointed.Robin Hood has a fairly interesting premise: How did Robin Longstride become the infamous hero of the poor? Unfortunately this film is plagued by several problems. Robin Hood doesn't do anything new, nor particularly well. Instead of focusing on being one type of film it tries to be several, and fails at all in my opinion. It has action, but is isn't groundbreaking or even very exciting except that the film does put a notable emphasis on the deadliness of archery in battles of the time especially during the finale. The film has a love story, but it is so forced that I almost laughed out loud a few times. It is ""cute"", and Robin Hood would probably be a good date movie, but my God is it lame and childish.Where this film fails the most, in my opinion, is in some of the small things that can make an otherwise decent movie terrible...as the familiar saying goes, ""the devil is in the details."" There were several moments where I was baffled by what I was seeing on the screen. I can't really go into these without possibly giving away some of the film, but if you are the type of person who has an active mind and notices small nuances or details of films then you should stay away. Very very far away.All of that said, this film does have at least one interesting battle scene and although I thought the love story was ""trite,"" Crowe and Blanchett do at least play love interests who are believable in their interest for one another by the end of the film.So to sum up: Well made film featuring mediocre plot, comedy, and action with pretty poor and forced romance. I felt like this film would appeal to older folks, people who like the historical time period, and people who don't like to think too much while watching a film.If you have a significant female other that is also interested in this film and you feel like watching an overly long movie, then I certainly condone cozy-ing up with her for 2+ hours.I think this film deserves a low 6 to mid 6, at best.",Robin Hood

But then I noticed that it got some fairly bad criticism and bad marks, and I really couldn't understand why.I think most people were expecting to see the classic tale of Robin Hood and his Merry Men, trying to undermine the bad King John and were disappointed when the movie went another way. However, I really liked the story behind the movie, it manages to put the Robin Hood legend into context, creating a well defined and believable story. The screenplay was, in my opinion, really well written, most importantly because of the fact that it defines characters really well. It's not just another war movie with lots of blood and dramatic duels and deaths. It focuses a lot on history and backgrounds, setting the stage for what will probably be a pretty successful trilogy. Another thing people seem to criticize, is the length of the movie. Well, I'm not the most patient person, and I hate it when a movie drags you on and on for an hour before you see anything remotely interesting. But this wasn't the case. I sat through the whole movie, watching every scene with interest, without getting bored by the dialogue (which tends to happen a lot with most movies lately). It managed to get me interested in the story, rather than just the action. Most of it has to do with the good writing and directing that i already mentioned.I cannot give the movie a 10, or a 9, mostly because I reserve those marks for movies that really ""get to me"". Movies that, in some way, manage to leave a mark on you when you watch them. This movie, even though it's a good one, it's not one of those.

The second half on the other hand had a lot going on, maybe a little too much. Honestly speaking, it was a relief from the first half and I started enjoying the film to a certain degree but the story was drifting from one end to the other and there were parts that didn't appeal to me at all. It could have done with a few more comic dialogues to make it more livelier for the audience. The French were shown to be clever enough to plot against the English in the start but all their smartness couldn't make them prepared for any sort of resistance even though they seemed to be in greater numbers than the English army who despite all their prior issues managed to gather everyone just at the very brink of time to defend their lands.

This movie tells the story of Robin Hood as Batman Begins told the story of Batman. We get to know his background and see how he became the famous outlaw. It starts just as Gladiator, with a great battle. After that it gets a little slow, only to get pumping awesome towards the end. The acting was great. Russell Crowe felt really stable and secure in the lead, Cate Blanchett was convincing and fascinating as Mais Marion and Mark Strong was of course great as the villain Godfrey. The one who steals the show, however, is Max Von Sydow. He is amazing as Marion's father-in-law and is both funny and moving. He really glows, and as a proud swede, it makes my heart warm. William Hurt doesn't do much and is easily forgotten and I was kind of disappointed they didn't show more of the Sheriff of Nottingham(played by Angus Macfadyen). However, the scenery, the cinematography and the music was just amazing and gave me lots of goosebumps, and the action-scenes were really well made. Just what you'd expect from Scott. A really enjoyable and entertaining epic, that makes your heart pound and your eyes glow. Screw Kevin Costner, this is the real Robin Hood.",Robin Hood
338,mj_jernigan,Where did the Lost Boys come from?,6,24 July 2019,"I thought the historical mashup was working fairly well... until it hit the battle with the French on the beach. The film lost two stars in that scene alone. Where did Marion come from? She suddenly rode nilly across England (and Wales?) with the Lost Boys on ponies in an afternoon? Ponies? And what is she doing in armor? Must we turn every female hero into an action hero as well these days? Nikita was great, but I've become bored with nearly every implementation of the concept since.",Robin Hood
339,jpmyers15-104-234102,Acceptable New Version,7,16 September 2014,"When I first saw the previews for this movie when it came out, I was excited. Russell Crowe generally does not disappoint. He seems to play the same rugged, war general, tough guy roles except for when he played in A Beautiful Mind. The movie as a whole wasn't bad at all. It wasn't as great as I thought it would be, but it gives you the impression like there's more to come. Will we get a sequel? I don't know, but that seems to be their goal based on the way the movie ended. I would have liked to see Robin Hood fight more, but I understand it was more of an origins type of movie. Interesting take on the Robin Hood character. I think Russell Crowe playing in this role was a good idea. The Sheriff of Nottingham was a clown, in my opinion. He's traditionally a tough, jerk of a man but he seemed weak and passive in this movie. I loved the old man, Robin's new dad. He was good. Sad to see him die but I'm glad he made Godfrey bleed.",Robin Hood
340,hejsamester,From great to mediocre to terrible,6,16 May 2010,"I loved the first half, enjoyed the next fourth and shook my head in disbelief the last fourth of the movie.The story of an England in peril, the portray of the northern barons who both feel alienated and abused by the king is really well made. It's a great and interesting take on how England (and most of Europe) was around 1200. The beginning siege of the small, French castle supports this with it's feel of everyday life as fighting, eating and drinking. The story of Robin hustling himself to knighthood and a handful of riches is great too, it gives the tale a new, interesting spin. The character of Lady Marian fits the new tale very well, and I like her older portray as well as her blind father. Basically most of the actors are doing a great job, and where they aren't, I would more likely blame the writers and Ridley Scott.A general mistake of the movie in my opinion is that the scenes are simply too small to be believable. In Nottingham we never really see anything else than Marian's home and the town center. At the castle siege at the beginning, it seems like a very small setup too, and we never really see a huge, English army. Just as the beach battle at the end seems very small compared to it being the epic clash of the movie. We don't really see any huge scenes of proper proportions of London, which could have been great. We mostly see the inside of Tower, the courtyard and Robin delivering the crown to the queen.The movie starts taking a bad turn when Godfried - the new evil servant of John - starts harassing northern England with his 200 Frenchmen. The character Godfried would fit better in a Jean Claude van Damme type of movie and the whole happening of him tossing about northern England in ten minutes of film makes it a bit hastened. England was covered in woods and northern England wasn't easy to get around in. All in a days work, aye? This haste of story line seems to go on for most of the rest of the movie and destroys the interesting political plot and serious portray of an England in ruins. References to the original story have also been forced in so they seem a bit out of place (i.e. the Sheriff of Nottingham has no role other than being nasty to Marian and get beaten by the French).A last mention would be the long list of history inaccurate things. To mention a few: The costumes Robin and Marian wears when inspecting the town is more like 1600+ outfits. Prince (king) John claims to be appointed by God in the end of the movie, but the Diving Rights of Kings weren't introduced in the 1200. The beach battle; rascals on ponies using sticks to fight down veteran French soldiers, Robin wielding an anti-plate armor hammer while no one bothered to bring any plate armor, the French vessels (!!!), the tactics of charing down to the beach instead of shooting down the French, the French not scouting the area first (what happened to the guys lighting fires on the beach?) and so forth...My guess is that Ridley Scott were cutting the movie together and saw that the only really good part was the beginning and desperately chose to stretch it to the first half of the movie. In my humble opinion, the movie went from a 10 in the first half to a 6 when the story started rushing and to a solid 2 during the beach battle.Too bad, the movie had potential.",Robin Hood
341,fe_scolfaro,Watchable,5,1 December 2013,"There's not much to say about this title, except that this is a perfect example of a movie MURDERED by its soundtrack. This has to be -the- worst soundtrack of every major studio productions in the last decade, every scoring mistake possible is made. For instance, a repeating motive for over 2 hours that makes me want to mute the whole thing and shuts my brain down to what's being said.Add to that the ever pervasive string stabs on the mix, louder than explosions and dialogs alike, and you're in for an unnerving experience. That's very unfortunate, 'cause the story is carefully woven (except for a goof here and there, as usual), and the acting is a lot better than, say, Kevin Costner's Robin Hood.My conclusion is that with a better soundtrack this movie wouldn't have flopped so bad.",Robin Hood
342,eli-ass,Epitome of mediocrity,4,8 August 2010,"This new Robin Hood should be a new approach to the legend. I thought this wouldn't be a great but solid new version ... but this wasn't even that.The story is indeed not the usual thing we already know. It tells us about the time before Robin Hood becomes an outlaw showing him fighting as a ordinary soldier in war against France. After the king dies on the battlefield and the knights who shall return his crown to England are murdered Robin Longstride(his real name here)rather coincidentally comes along and finds his (nearly) dead buddies. Now it's up to him to return not only the crown but also a sword from one of the dying knights. Robins group masquerade as the dead knights to ship over to England. Assuming the identity of the dead knight who gave him the sword Robin gets the target of the evil guys - and the King's son. While France is preparing an invasion Robin with his new identity is the one to reunite the Englishmen and bring freedom and peace.When I first read about this I thought this is gonna be a more serious and darker version of the Robin Hood tale. But no. At times this movie was so ridiculously stupid that I cringed. There are tons of ""jokes"" in here that are so flat and unfunny and out of place it made me sick ... especially when parts of the audience start out laughing for no reason. This movie is the epitome of mediocrity and cheesy Hollywood ""action"". I also was surprised how little story there actually was. It is really Robin rushing from one incident to the other. Everything feels kind of forced. For example a scene where the king is debating with some noblemen about the rights of the poor and how he - the king - could easily gain the respect of his people they fairly disagree. Then Robin comes along and within a few sentences he convinced the king and reunites the army. The relationship between Robin and Marion doesn't really work either. All the characters stay super superficial.As director Ridley Scott is well known for his feel for grand scale action blockbusters the battle sequences in Robin Hood are certainly well made. But we also have seen these kind of battles thousands of times before now.The movie is definitely not something to see on the big screen for my money, and I would not even say you need to see this picture any time.4.5/10",Robin Hood
343,jnr83,Absolute Rubbish,1,13 October 2010,"Okay stay away from this rubbish. It seems that Ridley Scott has really lost his knack and delivered this piece of amateurish rubbish. It seems that the script writers were like five year old children writing a movie for adults. If I were five years old I may indeed like this but I think mature minds need mature material. The plot if ridiculous. Why would Robin Hood spend most of his time in the movie playing the part of a dead husband? Would not someone in the village have seen through the charade? Further why is Marion a widow and not a virgin? I think after the success of Braveheart, perhaps Mel Gibson should have been entrusted to direct this movie. The ending where Marion rides into battle with little boys is rubbish and the french with their D-Day style landing is absurd. Most of the movie is quite boring and even though Russell Crowe was outstanding in Gladiator, his acting was not up to scratch. If you want watch a good movie, watch Braveheart or Troy and pass this one up. Anyway guys and girls this one belongs in the B movie category.JNR",Robin Hood
344,Ytadel,A mythical figure minus the myth is just some guy,5,2 December 2010,"Ridley Scott aimed to bring Robin Hood down to earth and in that straightforward respect he was successful. The problem is that he arguably brought Robin Hood CRASHING down to earth, jammed like a square peg in a round hole into a generic semi-epic of medieval warfare and political intrigue. Change the names of Robin, Little John, Marian, and the village of Nottingham and I'd pretty much have no idea that this screenplay was ever written with the intention of being a Robin Hood movie — even the villain, a French spy and marauder named Godfrey, is a brand new creation, with the Sheriff reduced to a piddling, zero-impact supporting character. It ends up feeling like a little bit of Robin Hood mythos accidentally leaked onto a print of Braveheart or Gladiator so they said to hell with it and decided to release it in theaters, albeit with the bloodshed dialed back to PG-13 levels.That's not to imply that the movie is boring or devoid of action; there's plenty of battles, hundreds dead, and even a spot of comic relief in Little John and Friar Tuck. But when I think of Robin Hood the giant neon sign in my mind flashes the word ADVENTURE, and I would in no way, shape, or form ever describe Scott's Robin Hood as an adventure movie. A medieval war movie perhaps, but not an adventure movie. There's a little bit of travel, sure, but Robin spends at least half if not more of the runtime just chilling in Nottingham, flirting with Marian and tilling the soil. And, sorry to be unimaginative, but I wanna see Robin Hood getting chased, sneaking under the enemy's nose in disguise, picking up new companions on his journey, swashbuckling, and in general feeling like a rogue, none of which this Robin Hood does. It's a bizarrely dry interpretation of one of popular fiction's most infamous scoundrels.Part of the problem is the badly miscast leads. There's fun to be had in Kevin Durand's Little John, Max von Sydow's Sir Walter Loxley, Sherlock Holmes and Kick-Ass's Mark Strong further cementing his villainous typecasting as Godfrey, and even a bit of scenery-chewing in Oscar Isaac's King John, but however many Academy Awards they may have between them I don't think that Russell Crowe and Cate Blanchett were right for Robin and Marian. Fine actors, especially Blanchett, but they have virtually no personalities in this movie and no romantic chemistry whatsoever. Dryness emanates from them; I was worried they would near a spark and catch flame.It's also kind of bizarre how the film purports to be the beginning of the legend, yet Robin Hood is played by an actor nearing fifty. Don't get me wrong; I'm not one of those morons who needs all my film leads to be whippersnappers — I'm the world's biggest enthusiast of 58-year-old Liam Neeson's newfound career as a pulpy action star — but both Crowe and Blanchett just look too damn old for these parts. I would have rather seen someone like, I don't know, Stardust's Charlie Cox as Robin Hood. Not as good an actor, no, but better for this role. I never thought I'd say this, but even Orlando Bloom would have been better.As for what the film gets right, if you've seen Gladiator and Kingdom of Heaven (which, by the way, in its director's cut form ties with Alien as the best film Scott's ever done) you know that Ridley Scott has a real talent for making these medieval epics look and feel just right. The sets, the costumes, the castles, the villages, the weaponry, the layer of Middle Ages dirt and grime on everything, it all looks great, especially bolstered by beautiful cinematography. I won't go so far as to say it makes you want to be there, but it's authentic and drawn with painterly skill, simply a nice movie to look at whatever near-fatal weaknesses may be found in the storytelling.Still, I'd only recommend seeing this Robin Hood if you're really, really into medieval warfare and conflict. If not and you want some adventure then just watch Robin Hood: Prince of Thieves again. That's right, you big baby, you know you like it.",Robin Hood

346,Jigsaw_At_The_Disco,Wants to be Gladiator,4,2 June 2010,"It's too bad, Ridley Scott really messed things up this time. I read a lot of bad reviews, but I still came in with fairly high expectations, after all GLADIATOR was one of the best movies of the decade. Sadly, ROBIN HOOD failed to impress me. At some points, I felt like I was watching a little show put on by a bunch of guys at a medieval fair. Most of the time, I felt like I was watching a movie produced by Jerry Bruckheimer.(Overdone, unfunny quips thrown in here and there to lighten the mood, overacting, huge, distracting scores, etc.) I'm not trying to slam Bruckheimer, he's made some very good movies but lately this is the kind of stuff he's been involved in. Take PRINCE OF PERSIA and NATIONAL TREASURE for example, two movies unworthy of a review if you ask me. Sadly, PRINCE OF PERSIA is only a little worse then ROBIN HOOD. Surprisingly, I was less bored during that then this. I just felt that ROBIN HOOD had a little more texture to it. But don't forget I'm comparing it to a movie with absolutely zero texture in it at all whatsoever. I guess Russel Crowe delivers a good performance, but he doesn't put nearly as much power in it as he did with Gladiator. I'd say that the only real upside with this film was the cinematography.Very Disappointing.3.0/10.0F",Robin Hood
347,smithr1223,Beautiful but no cigar,3,28 May 2012,"There's a wealth of information from which to write an amazing script but it just didn't materialize. Beautiful production values and some great actors but, because there was little or no time spent developing the characters, I wasn't drawn in by the film and so I just felt like a bored spectator. It seemed more like the first ""episode"", with one or more to come, so in the end I felt cheated because I had to sit through endless, sometimes even comical, battle scenes. Russell Crowe missed the mark for me, in major part because his accent was so fluid (where's he from again? What did he say? Wait? Robin's from Australia now? No, wait, he's from Wales now! Crikey). So glad I didn't pay to see the film or buy the DVD - got it for free from my local library. I can't recommend the film unless you're a huge fan of ""Robin Hood' and can overlook much of the anachronistic flubs in this film. Other reviewers have outlined them so clearly I needed repeat them here. I got so bored I just kept looking for Baron pins, the giant gold ones, because I'd bought a set from the film at a charity auction. Yes, really, that's how bored I was and that's saying a lot because I generally love anything ""Robin Hood"".",Robin Hood
348,Naughtyb,Lost it on the beach I'm afraid,7,27 May 2010,"I thought that this film was quite refreshing with a new look at an old tale. That is up until the beach ""Saving Private Ryan"" invasion of the French armada. Hollywood is famous for re-writing history and much of the time it doesn't bother me as I go to be entertained.I was expecting so much from this film but at the end was left disappointed. Medieval landing craft, a French invasion fleet, come on Ridley Scott, what were you thinking of? From that point in the film was lost and seemed to scramble to a quick ending, as if the script writers just wanted to wash their hands of it.Ridley Scott can do much better than this. It was like they had a change of director a third of the way through? Or maybe Ridley was just trying to hard. Either way he ruined what was looking to be one of the years best movies, shame.I am still a big fan though and will attend the sequel if they make one as I know he will make amends.",Robin Hood

I've heard Russell Crowe , the new Robin Hood, referring to Errol Flynn's version as crap. Crap? Can you imagine! Errol Flynn made that movie ""The Adventures Of Robin Hood"" in 1939 and people still watch it today, 77 years later, with utter delight. Russell Crowe's ""Robin Hood"" was made only 7 years ago and it's already forgotten. I was appalled by his comment and realized that Oscar winner or not, wisdom or knowledge is not part of the equation. I've heard Russell Crowe in a different interview saying he never trained as an actor. He claims he doesn't know anything about Stanislavski and more importantly, he doesn't care to know.

Which is really this film's biggest failing, you don't believe you're there, you don't get engrossed in the story and in the end you don't really care about the ending.Yes it does have some interesting neo-twists on the old fable, but they still only help lift the film from being rather poor to very average.It's not dreadful, in fact some of it is shot very beautifully. These moments however were all too fleeting and often segmented by tired unbelievable scenes that served little or no purpose and really didn't act as any sort of conduit for forthcoming events. As with a lot of Mr Scott's more recent efforts, bits of it work and bits of it don't.It's just a shame that Ridley tore apart a classic and couldn't reassemble something better with the doubtless wealth of talents at his disposal.",Robin Hood
351,archravenstorm,"Fresh, rich and intelligent - a big surprise that I loved it",8,17 May 2010,"Reading earlier ""meh"" type reviews had me not expecting too much when I went with two other adults to see this on Saturday. Figured I'd see a few good fights. Having seen it, I'm glad I decided to check it out for myself, as the varied details that seemed to be picked on by other people were no issue for us whatsoever. To quote one of my companions, who wasn't even interested and was just humoring us by going with us, she was ""mesmerized from the first screen, and loved it."" For me, who was dubious about the supposed treatment (the older Robin Hood who isn't a laughing young nobleman, the various plot lines that needed to be pulled together, the older and tougher Marion), Scott and Crowe made this thing WORK. It's not a ""traditional"" Errol Flynn hero, but a believable, realistic set of characters and a credible interpretation, even with some historical twists. It was fresh and interesting to see a Robin Hood that was just kind of fed up, with the kind of boots-on-the-ground friends you'd expect him to have (quite a difference from the immediately charismatic Mel Gibson in Braveheart). It's what is, before an ""ordinary"" person is made into a legend. King John as depicted isn't wholly a weak, silly, weasel. And Marion - Cate Blanchett is simply superb. Even the depicted ""forest boys"" would be accurate - as in today when a generation is abandoned without parents, as in some places in Mexico and Africa.Nor was the atmosphere as complained by some, all dreary and gritty. It looked like what I thought England looks like (I've never been). And accurate portrayals of the villages and buildings of the time.Afterwards, an episode of on the History Channel featuring Scott and Crowe helped me understand more of the incredible turbulence of the times, and the context of what Scott was attempting to do with a depiction of the rise of the ""yeoman"" class and the strain of the feudal system, and how the well-traveled Robin Hood in this film is bringing new ideas of government to the rigid feudal system.So, this isn't what we were all expecting, but I saw two movies this weekend, Iron Man 2 and Robin Hood. And while I loved Iron Man 2, hardly thought about it afterward (until the next installment) while my mind has drifted back now and again to think about Robin Hood, and if they don't make a follow-up so we can see what happens next I'll be pretty upset.May not be a younger audiences' kind of Robin Hood, but to me it is a well-crafted, rich story for adults, especially adults who love a satisfying book that they can sink into. Unfortunately, and I hope it's not the case, that that is why this movie may do better in Europe, sometimes it seems Americans don't have a lot of patience and want it simple, with some color and flash (yes, I'm American). I just don't get why this isn't more appreciated - some flaws, yes, but well worthy of place in the video collection. I hope to see it again, before it leaves theaters. Other people must have liked it too, as our packed mall theater applauded when it was over, and no walk-outs at all.",Robin Hood
352,paulimiles,What a waste of talent,4,1 August 2010,"I was born in Nottingham but have lived my life in Australia. I've always found the The Robin Hood legend interesting but largely unbelievable in it's traditional telling. So when this release was touted, promising a retelling of the legend, I keenly looked forward to it. Especially with a couple of Aussies as the two main leads and legendary director, Ridley Scott at the helm.Wow, what a let down. A boring, slow paced telling of the tale that should more accurately have been titled ""Robin Hood - The Early Years."" OK, I wasn't looking for ""Robin Hood and his merry men, riding through the glen"" but where was the excitement and the character development between Robin and Marion. None existent.The battle scenes were lame, inferior to better offerings on show 20 years ago. And don't start me on the dialogue. I'm sure it was scripted by John Cleese, Michael Palin and the Python crew. When they threw in the line ""None shall pass"" and started asking riddles I was looking about for an attack by a ""killer rabbit"". Apologies to those who aren't acquainted with MP and the Holy Grail.Some of King John's lines were amusing at first but did he have to keep it up for the whole movie ? As for the actors, Russell Crowe seemed largely disinterested except for a few late opportunities to kiss Cate Blanchett. She gave her usually strong performance despite looking decidedly unglamorous (don't know why they chose to make her look so manly). Max Von Sydow was a standout and deserves credit for putting his heart into his role. William Hurt was solid, if miscast. Sorry, but I'm over Mark Strong playing the bad guy. And as for Oscar Isaac as King John, well I suggest he contacts Terry Gilliam for his next gig. He seemed as suitable to the role as Mr.Bean.Oh, did I mention the cross channel invasion. OK, no Saving Private Ryan jokes but it did kinda look like DDay in reverse, complete with wooden landing craft.All in all it was a total flop considering the talent available in front of the camera and behind it. Its without doubt the worst Ridley Scott movie I've seen to date. They said the movie had a lot of problems pre production. Boy does it show.Finally, like many others I consider Kate Winslet and Cate Blanchett two of the best female leads going around. It's surprising to many people that Winslet seems to always pip Blanchett come Award time. I noticed that Winslet turned down the role of Marion and Blanchett snapped it up. Maybe their decision making when choosing their movies has something to do with it.Sorry, two stars.",Robin Hood

356,logans_place,Straight to Blue Ray,6,13 May 2010,"I trust this director to produce a quality and enjoyable film and this is the impulse that took me to the cinema yesterday. Alas, what an error. In short, acting is very good quality, I thought Crow was a good Robin Hood and his face fits as well as Gibson did to Mad Max and Crow's supporting cast was excellent (William Hurt is back to form). I liked the fact that the castles had straw covered floors and there had been a serious attempt at historical accuracy. The negative points are lots. Although the script was good and the plot not that bad it was poorly executed on film. It did not make that much sense and silly mechanisms were used to get the viewer from one scene to the next. I also hold the opinion that other location directors did an awful lot of the work on the film as Scott's flourishes were few and far between. A lot of the issues are the result of a low budget. Frankly it felt like the BBC had a hand in the production as the film quality and the type of actors brought in are regularly on the small, British only, screen. One answer to this problem is that as a prequel this is nothing more than the bland concrete foundation to a serial and the next one (which no doubt stole a vast amount of the budget from this) will be absolutely tremendous. The final battle at the end was so lame that it looked like a reenactment for the History Channel and had none of the majesty we expect from Scott and Co. Overall, I agree with some of the other reviews - this is solid but has nothing more to add to the genre. With Crow on board for the sequel it could be stunning and I fully expect it to be what I thought this was. Get it on video just before the next one comes out but don't actually waste your cash.",Robin Hood
357,ManofClay64,Better on the small screen,8,3 February 2019,"Saw this at the cinema having enjoyed Gladiator. Was disappointed as the story seemed to ramble and I didn't have much sympathy with the characters. There was a lot of hype too, which isn't always a good thing...
When it came in on Film 4 I thought I'd give it another go and actually it's grown on me to the extent I've seen and enjoyed it several times since. The problem at the cinema I think was that the characters need more time to come to life - they're fairly simply depicted, in some ways too subtly for a 'blockbuster' and the characters are well played by all the main actors especially good I think are Kate Blanchet, Max Von Sydow and Mark Addy, though Mr Crowe is good too.",Robin Hood
358,dazworthy,Could have been so much more,6,2 November 2010,"There seems to be a lot of negativity flying around about this movie, and I after seeing it I think some if it is warranted. But the bottom line is it's not bad. It's just not fantastic, and I think many were reasonably expecting it to be. With Russell Crowe starring, and Ridley Scott directing a period action adventure, you'd be forgiven for expecting this movie be as compelling as Gladiator. It is not. However some of the things that we all liked about Gladiator are again on show here – the battle scenes have the same masterful direction and magnitude, and Russell Crowe again commands the screen with his considerable presence. But Robin Hood lacks the great characters, and doesn't really develop them as the movie goes on, which makes the movie seem a bit slow and uninteresting in parts (especially given its 140 min. running time). Whereas you could feel the anger and betrayal of Maximus in Gladiator, you don't especially sympathize with Robin Hood other than vaguely recognizing him as a ""good man"". The supporting cast is impressive: Cate Blanchett (Maid Marion), Max Von Sydow, and William Hurt all do a great job with what they have to work with. But I can't help feeling like all this Oscar-talent is wasted here without some meaty characters to sink their teeth into. Oscar Isaac has gone from playing Jose Ramos-Horta in Balibo to Prince John in Robin Hood, which you've got to admit is pretty impressive versatility, and I did like Mark Strong as the villainous traitor Godfrey. There is also some deviations from the original Robin Hood story, but rather than being a hindrance, I think they actually make it more interesting. So if you don't especially like Russell Crowe or battles scenes on a grand scale, or if (like me) you just can't fathom Cate Blanchett as a primary love interest, then Robin Hood may not be for you. But it does have enough thrills, action and star-power to be entertaining enough for a quiet night on DVD.",Robin Hood

I had no idea that there were so many ""professionals reviewers"" on these boards !! All nit picking just for the sake of it. It was a well done story which as others have pointed out may be a prequel but give great promise of what may be coming. Good new slant on the story, well worth watching. May be some spoilers!! look away NOW !Cate Blanchett's performance is just perfect.

Russell Crowe' Robin is also very different from the usual character. He brings a compassion to the character, rather than the usual brash slapstick type that is often portrayed. Look forward to the next one !",Robin Hood
360,yoyo_hamblen,A must watch Robin Hood,10,17 May 2010,"Initially I thought, ""What again"" when I hear this movie was coming out. I mean we have all seen Kevin Costners version which was cute, and THAT soundtrack which is still played on radio stations throughout the night. However, driving around London as I was, and taking an opportunity to see the billboard advertisements I became interested in the expression on Russel Crowe's face. So with good mate who is also keen movie buff I went to see it.I was gripped from the beginning, despite the odd accents here and there, of which my German friend said to me, ""Which accent is this?"" I had no answer, but hey, it's the only downside in my view. Crowe did sound Irish on a couple of occasions.Crowe is just good at this, this role was made for him. I have wanted to see him in something like this since Gladiator, and who can match that performance? Cate Blanchet is just perfect in everything, and their chemistry was awesome to partake in. One scene in particular where we get to see Crowe's upper body naked, drew in many a gasp from the audience, and not just my own! Very refreshing whilst at the same time thinking, he looks good for his age, and all my girlfriends have said he is still on their list. I agree, he is a manly man, and quite uniquely placed in Hollywood right now. The battle scenes were awesome, and it's an allround pleaser hitting both war/fight scenes, good winning over evil, great performances also from the supporting cast so well cast that you find yourself unable to put your finger on where you know them from! Loved Hurt, believable, likable, moral, it had all the kicks if anything it's a tiny bit predictable, but I think if we are honest, we have to have the happy ending, it just completes our night of entertainment! Have fun!",Robin Hood
361,leejross1972,"Wow, what a Line Up!",9,3 August 2019,"As I'm guessing Sir Scott would have the last say on the Actors he wishes to work with on his projects, I cant recall the last time I was so excited to see such a fantastic cast on one project. It's no surprise considering, however Robin Hood is heavy on Actors who've already made their mark in Hollywood and those up in comers who now, decades later are heavyweights themselves. Absolutely not only worthy a watch but to sit in my personal collection.",Robin Hood
362,Nestor_Sanchez,Entertaining and visually splendid... but pretty stupid at times.,6,7 November 2010,"Asides from cinematography, production and music score, there's not much in this one. Entertaining enough for a rental once you lower your expectations.There are many things that are almost idiotic. To have these amateurish mistakes in a RS film was quite a surprise for me:19th century folk music player by 12th century villagers. - Lady Mariam, a NOBLE working the land and behaving like a 20th century liberated woman? - The final battle scene with D-day landing crafts and orphans kids riding ponies fighting French invaders. - So Robin Hood is called like that why exactly? Because he mentioned ONCE the word ""hood"" while they stole the grain? And he gets ostracized for what reason? Because someone told King John that the French surrendered to him? - No on notices that Robin is 10 years younger and has dark hair when he passes as Locksley.Im going to stop there..",Robin Hood
363,dirikan,One hell of a good movie,9,8 June 2010,"While I was walking into the theater, I was honestly not expecting to watch such a pretty movie. It was way better than I expect it to be.First of all, the cast was awesome. Cate, Russel & the old -father- including the 3 friends of Robin acted quite well. The bad guys also did a good job in acting.The musics were also OK. Not very much emphasized tough but still it was OK. At least we heard some!The story was to explain how he became Robin Hood. And we did learn it. I think the king got what he deserved in the movie Kevin C. played in.I must admit it's not a masterpiece, but it fulfills my expectations and I was glad to spend 2.5 hours sitting in the cinema and watching this movie.@Russel Crowe, you should play in more ""battle"" movies dude!",Robin Hood
364,helboy,Clearly intended for sequels...,5,29 October 2010,"Not much of a ""Robin Hood"" movie.Almost like another medieval knights tale.Screenplay and elaborate sets are a treat.But imagining the wily,quick as a deer Robin Hood in the shape of a WWF wrestler is a little hard.Either the director did not fully get the gist of the character or else this is made into a career refresh for Crowe.How is a 200 pound hero expected to climb up trees or run without even a small sound??? Hard to believe.And no,Robin Hood was never a swordsman,AFAIK.Battle scenes are all OK,though doesn't compare to LOTR trilogy or even the Orlando Bloom starrer ""Kingdom of Heaven"".The scene where Blanchets character rides out to full battle with some..what??? some kids on puny horses to meet a battle hardened French army??!!! Wasn't that a little bit over the top even by dramatic? All in all if you want to have a prequel to the coming sequels of Robin Hood this is not a very bad movie to spend your time on.",Robin Hood
365,zopop119,Pretty Good Version of a Worn Out Story,7,10 October 2010,"I wasn't sure what to expect from this version of Robin Hood and I was pleasantly surprised. I like the twist on the usual versions although i must admit I was waiting for the other shoe to drop on Robin's alliance with King John.... For where this film wanted to go, the casting was pretty good. They sort of take the Sheriff of Nottingham out of the plot for the most part and as things developed it seemed more likely that it was setting up for a sequel for sure. However, this film could stand on it's own just because of the many versions before it where King Richard returns at the end as the big hero.(that is sort of left hanging as well since the last time we saw Richard in this movie he was alive) I like the multitude of characters in this and that several plot lines were developed to all coincide near the conclusion. Russel Crowe and Cate Blanchett did a fine job, but Max Von Sydow is such a classic and really great in the role of the elder Loxley. It was good to see his ""Merry Men"" and the boys of the forest presented in a more realistic way than the simplistic fairy tale versions of this story. It all addressed the real nature of England during that time period as opposed to simply the struggle between the rich and the poor. I am glad they put King John back in his rightful place as the ultimate horrible tyrant, because I was beginning to buy into his reformation for a few minutes... Of course nothing will ever replace ""Men In Tights""... but I give this one a whole hearted thumbs up that will keep you in it til the end.",Robin Hood
366,MovieManPat,Robin Hood was just okay,6,25 May 2010,"I've always loved the story of Robin Hood. I remember being a kid and fantasizing about living in Sherwood Forest, leading my band of merry men as we stole for the corrupt wealthy overlords and gave it all to the poor. I watched Rocket Robin Hood. Even that damn Disney movie holds a special place in my heart.So when I heard that Ridley Scott was doing a new Robin Hood movie, I was thrilled. Ridley Scott has made some of my favourite movies (Alien, Blade Runner), so who better to try their hand at telling a tale of the gallant thief of the Middle Ages. Then I heard that Russell Crowe had been cast as Robin Hood. Suddenly, I had misgivings. Scott and Crowe have made some great movies together (American Gangster) but they've made some real crap (A Good Year). Plus, at 45, Crowe seemed a little old for the part. Sean Connery played an older Robin Hood in Robin and Marian, but that was sort of the point.However, my love of Robin Hood was greater than my trepidation and I ventured out to see the movie. What did I think? It was okay. The movie is essentially a long origin tale (kinda like Batman Begins but not as good), giving us the background on Robin Hood and how he came to live in Sherwood Forest, robbing the rich and giving to the poor. Screenwriter Brian Helgeland apparently tried to base the story in fact, making Robin Hood a common archer on King Richard the Lionheart's crusade. King Richard dies, his arrogant, incompetent younger brother John ascends to the throne, and hijinks ensue. In this tale, John is betrayed by a friend, Godfrey (played by Mark Strong), who attempts to aid King Philippe of France in invading England.There are two grave problem with this movie. One, it is far too flabby. Clocking in a two hours and twenty-eight minutes, there is not much action and far too much exposition. Indeed, when the film really starts to move, during the climatic battle with the French, the film is pretty much over. What's more, not all that much happens. The romance with Marion is woefully underdeveloped. Yes, Robin is a noble man and his gallantry wins her over, but there is no spark between the two actors (Crowe and Cate Blanchett as Marion).The other problem is the lack of a good villain. In the Robin Hood tales, there are two great villains, the Sheriff of Nottingham and Prince John. In this movie, the Sheriff of Nottingham is a far more conflicted character, bound by duty to pursue Robin Hood rather than any personal desire. I was unimpressed with Prince John. He comes off as a petty and jealous boy, rather than a crafty duplicitous conniver. He is played with almost comical overacting by Oscar Isaac. That leaves Mark Strong, who seems to specialize in being the bad guy. However, unlike his performance in Sherlock Holmes or Kick-Ass, he is severely lacking here. His reasons for betraying his country are never explicitly stated, so the audience is left wondering just why this guy is going around, slaughtering his own countrymen. Ambiguity aside, it's good to know the motivations of the villain. Seriously, I was longing for Alan Rickman to come sneering on to the screen while I was watching. Say what you will about Robin Hood: Prince of Thieves, but Rickman owned the role as the Sheriff of Nottingham. He was almost pure evil personified in that movie.That said, I did enjoy other parts of the film. Crowe was excellent as Robin Hood, despite his wandering accent (he's Scottish, no, he's Irish, maybe he's Welsh?). In the scenes where he must command his men and lead them into battle, I believed he was Robin Hood. The actors playing his merry men, Little John (Kevin Durand), Will Scarlett (Scott Grimes) and Allan A'Dayle (Alan Doyle) were great. Watching the four men on screen, you got the sense that they had been in battle together and trusted each other implicitly. They three also provided some great comic relief. I also particularly enjoyed Max Von Sydow as Sir Walter Locksley, the man who takes in Robin Hood. The premise of the movie hinges on the fact that Robin Hood has assumed Locksley's son's identity as part of a ruse to return home from the crusade. Sydow plays the part perfectly, showing us a tired old man who still has some fight left in him.It would've been interesting to see the film that they could have made, had they cut out some of the fat. If you're a big fan of the legend of Robin Hood, I suggest you check it out. Otherwise, wait for the DVD. At least it didn't include another power ballad from Bryan Adams.",Robin Hood
367,provenelk,Exciting and original take on Robin Hood,7,12 May 2010,"First off, i want to say how refreshing it is for a big summer movie not to be on the band wagon of CGI or 3-D. At last a straight up movie not relying on any gimmicks!Robin Hood delivers what it promises. Solid action, good narrative, and the inclusion of a bit of history with action between England and France gives the movie an added meat and almost realistic feel to it. The dialogue is a bit ropey at times, and Robin's ""merry men"" could have had a bit more screen time, but otherwise i see no major fault with this movie.All in all a refreshing, exciting, fun, entertaining, nothing that you wouldn't expect from the pairing of Russel Crowe and Ridley Scott.7/10",Robin Hood
368,rid-diego,Amazing!!!,9,1 July 2010,"I really don't know what movie previous reviewers saw to say this movie is terrible. It was amazing! It was a goof at the opening charts, yes, but... it doesn't take anything to the movie's overall quality. Another reviewers said that there is no Robin Hood here... that was the point! This was stated since the beginning as a origins story... is really that hard to get? The climatic battle was criticized a lot too but without any kind of logic. I mean, how armies landed on shores since the Roman Empire? I love Ridley Scott's films. Yes, this not one of his bests but it's still a pretty damn good flick. The acting was pretty good with special mention to Mark Strong (amazing) and the veteran Max Von Sydow: with all his years he's still one of the best on the business. The battle sequences were beautifully shot and greatly choreographed (a Ridley Scott's constant, I think). Every penny spent on the making of this film worth it. The story, though not really historically accurate, is compelling and very well constructed, reflecting in a great way the living of that time. But again, that a Scott's constant. He really knows how to make great films.",Robin Hood
369,the_weedy_seadragon,Excellent movie...,9,16 May 2010,"Russell Crowe and Cate Blanchett. Who wouldn't want to see two of the best Aussie actors in a lip lock? And then there's Max Von Sydow. He was old when I was a kid! Just amazing. The charming, obsequious, conniving Oscar Issac as Prince John is a scene stealer of the first order in this picture. It was funny and terrible, exciting and plot developing, a character driven story of heroes and villains. A grown-up movie. I can't see taking the kids to this one. I like that. They have their family pics and teen pics, this one is for me!",Robin Hood
370,joebloggz,A great movie of the legend likely truer to real life...,9,16 May 2010,"I saw this film with a friend last night & we both thoroughly enjoyed it - a very different twist to the Robin Hood legend - this I believed was likely far more closer to the real story (if true) and to reality. Who wouldn't assume the identity of a dead knight in order to gain quicker passage back to their homeland they longed to return to? I did like the little touches in the storyline, the bored chef by chance shooting the King from the battlements, the men noticing how many women were single in England as most were away fighting and the Loxley castle was probably in condition far truer to the time - dirty stone with straw underfoot. Lovely cinematography, solid acting, great sets, huge fight sequences, a believable hero & nasty bad guys & yes I'd watch it again at home - Well done Ridley.",Robin Hood
371,Movie_Reviewer_from_LA,Surprisingly Good,7,21 January 2011,"As an alternative vision of the Robin Hood story, I thoroughly enjoyed the movie. It isn't perfect but is great entertainment. The writers and directors have done an excellent job of reproducing a thirteenth century world. The barons live under conditions not far removed from their serfs. Everybody is unwashed and filthy and the floors of the liege halls are covered in old straw. A bath is a splash of water and people sleep with their hunting dogs.I especially enjoyed 'Maid' Marion as an older woman who, like Penelope of Ithaca, has remained faithful to her war-lost husband for 10 long years. She is one of the true heroes of the story, strong and noble at the same time. Still, the writers tried to get it right. Despite the fact that she lives a life not far removed from her 'subjects', she is still a noble. Relations with a commoner--even a brave, attractive and noble commoner--approaches social and personal impossibility.Warfare is brutal and even our 'Robin Hood' character admits to an act of incredible evil. Three thousand Muslims were slaughtered at Acre and our hero followed his King's orders and slaughtered a young woman at his feet. Our man detests both himself and his King for what was done, tells him about it and....I also enjoyed the way the writers and directors developed the character of the initially juvenile and spoiled Prince John. He matures but the film goes back on itself and ends rather weakly. I understand this, because the producers hope for a sequel, but it doesn't help the quality of the present film.Politically, the film is fascinating. The Robin Hood story has always had heavy political and egalitarian overtones. This film emphasizes it more than most Robin Hood stories. Not once do we hear reference to the old Saxon-Norman rift. It is a story of the power of the king against lesser men. As such--despite the fact that the writers may not have intended it--there is much for worried constitutionalists to celebrate about this film. Central governmental power is shown in a negative--even evil--light. Yeah.....",Robin Hood
372,AlxP-64,Extended setup for a sequel featuring the real Robin Hood,4,7 September 2010,"He does not live in a forest, he does not rob the rich, and he does not wear green; but he leads the English army against a French invasion and he almost makes King John sign the Magna Carta. And the film has no character is named Robin Hood: there is a Robin Longstride; there is a Sir Robin Loxley (with an x); the two merge into one -- but still there is no Robin Hood.The historical background is weird. There is a King Richard in the movie, but he dies in France and does not get to return to England. The movie's King Philip of France tries to invade England using Landing Craft Assault ships ripped from a WW2 documentary (you have to see this to believe it). Maid Marian is a 30 years old widow. Robin's main opponent is a high-ranking official with of mixed English and French ethnicity. The Anglo-Norman noblemen prefer to speak English, as does the King of France (who actually makes a point of asking the official mentioned above to speak English).Cate Blanchett is a great actress. Russell Crowe has great presence. Max von Sydow is a legend. But the script is hard to follow, especially given that the title promises a movie about Robin Hood, whereas the movie is a combination of ""Sommersby"" with the struggle of the English barons to limit the powers of royalty. And the movie is slow! It takes two hours until Robin is made an outlaw, and then the film ends. The only way to understand this is as an extended setup for one or two sequels featuring the real Robin Hood.",Robin Hood
373,justinconboy,Braveheart meets Private Ryan,6,14 May 2010,"This movie is like Braveheart meets Private Ryan. Not a great movie but one that will keep the box office ticking over for another few weeks. This is the first installment of about 2 more Robin Hood movies, I think!!! So it's like a prequel to what we might know Robin Hood as, from the Kevin Costner ear. It's a bit like Batman Begins, in the scene that we are brought back before the Robin Hood V The Sheriff of Nottingham story's. It's good, but not great, but worth watching. Itwon't win any Oscars or even get nominated for any... But still a good reason to get stuck into a Large Popcorn and Cola. The acting is very good by the entire main cast and even the support cast; the graphics are also quite good too (But, again, not Oscars good). I just felt I had seen it all before! There is nothing original in this movie. It's your ""Bog Standard"", Love Interest/ ""Epic"" Fight Scene/ Bad English King...... so on and so on. The writers do try and make this movie original by mixing it up with a French subplot, but all that does is actually MIX things up to a point of confusion!! The humor is few and far between here also. In the story of Robin Hood, he had a band of Merry Men. The opportunity to put some humor through the movie was lost here (5 Laughs at most). It's not like other movies where they have to stick in a comedy duo (Transformers 2!!) just to raise a few laughs! This movie already had a band of Merry Men to work with. Also, Little John should have been a bit taller. I know they are stupid points from a film making perspective... but they are still valid from an entertainment perspective.I've rated this movie 6/10, normally I would have given a movie, of this quality, a higher mark (maybe a 7 at a push); but it had a massive budget and should have done better. It just didn't grasp me at all. J",Robin Hood

This is certainly NOT the Robin Hood we are used to. It could have been called Walter Smith or something... I mean, they somewhat twisted the story into something new. If you like Russell Crowe, you should go and see this movie, but if you liked the Kevin Costner Robin Hood... well, maybe you are going to be a bit disappointed. Where are all those ""merry men"" that Robin Hood used to have? Robin don't steal the rich to feed the poor here, it's a completely new story!

377,rhodesmartin,140 minute montage of legend ruining storyline,2,6 June 2010,"So I was thinking how best to describe this film? The best I can come up with is this: Consider the top big budget films of the last few decades - now from each of these note their most ludicrous slow motion action scene, splice these into a 140 minute montage of legend ruining storyline & 'Bob's you uncle'.Don't believe me? Let me give you a few examples: A Knights Tale - a peasant masquerading as a Noble with the occasional flashback to childhood? Oh and an old blind man that feels you face. Kate Blanchet was the best thing in Robin Hood but to be fair I'd rather Sossaman & If fate meant that we had to lose an Australian actor I'd rather it had been Russel Crowe.Saving Private Ryan - a military beach landing with dead bodies floating in a red stained sea. Was it just me or did the landing craft in Robin Hood actually look like the flat bottomed front opening WWII craft that were used in Normandy? Temple of Doom/Star Wars - both have walls (one at least spike covered) that close in on the hero, only for them to escape in the nick of time! Kudos for coming up with a new 'two boats colliding with broken spiky oars' concept - only thing is boats float & there is water underneath making the escape far less exciting.Mask of Zorro - the heroine rescues women & children that have been locked in a burning structure whilst the 'men' battle it out with swords. At least the Mask of Zorro made me laugh for the right reasons, one liners and cheeky banter, not the plot.Braveheart - Speeches of freedom to the masses without a PA system, everyone cheers but very few people probably heard what was said, let alone agree with him.I hope you've found my examples sufficient to support my for-mentioned description.I can allow for geographical/logistical errors in film (such as why they attacked Darlington then Peterborough & then York, very long way round if your traveling by horse) but the lack of anything original is unforgivable.As you may have gathered I didn't like this film - I payed one whole English pound for the experience and felt that I myself had been taxed heavily by the King to fund a ridiculous campaign.If I had to describe this film in one word Woeful.",Robin Hood
378,finn-palm,Interesting take with historical ties,8,13 May 2010,"I just came back from the theater and I must say I was pleasantly surprised. This new take has great actors, nice costume, great camera direction and a solid story.The acting is very good and especially Cate Blanchet shines. Max von Sydow's English is getting better with every movie and he can finally portray someone without a Swedish accent.The costume is well done and almost as historically accurate as one can ask from a movie that tells a mostly fictional story.There are a few issues of course, that makes me lower the score.Comical relief is avoided mostly, but could have been left out altogether in my opinion. Luckily the people used for comic relief are not the ones you'd expect.And the final battle which is a big part of the movie annoys me greatly in it's composition, and you will see why when you watch the movie.And what in the world *is* that weapon that Little John is wielding? Could they not come up with something more appropriate?",Robin Hood
379,Brorim,Not a Robin Hood movie..,2,15 May 2010,"I really was enjoying the movie except that I had to constantly distance my mind from the fact that this movie in NO way is like the Robin Hood I read.The story is COMPLETELY rewritten and is so far of from the original that it is embarrassing. What on earth are the FRENCH doing in it ?? To me this movie completely falls to the ground because of the changes they have done to it. As an action movie with amazing settings and scenery it is really well done but as a Robin Hood movie it completely disappoints .You CAN NOT reinvent the story of Robin Hood and suddenly make the lords and barons the good guys and Prince John KING .. WHAT ???? What exactly motivated the writers to so bluntly move away from the original story boggles me.It is a shameless thing to force a redo of an already iconic character into something ""politically"" correct. If this movie had been named anything else and called something like ""What politics in England would be like if USA had been there in the 1200's"" I could have understood it. then the movie would have gotten a solid 8 for entertainment value but because of this story change it is now only worth a 4.If it is not broken do not try to fix it .that sums it up nicely .",Robin Hood
380,caesarjd,Horrible,1,29 May 2010,"Robin Hood is apparently Russell Crowe's ""Water World"". The movie, by Ridley Scott, is designed to be a historical production of Robin Hood, or that's my understanding based on the cinematography. The movie is so poorly constructed however, and the tactics so ridiculous, the audience actually broke out in laughter at several, serious, parts. The culminating battle at the end was terrible. In fact, Maid Marrian storming the beach with the 'lost boys' of Sherwood Forest at the end had us almost rolling. Of course the landing craft and the D-Day re-enactment scenes captured by Mr. Scott only added to our mirth... Seriously don't pay to see this movie.",Robin Hood

I am usually a fan of Russell Crowe but was surprised to see him sleepwalking his role.Inspite of this the movie works beautifully.this says volumes about the strength of character development and depth of story as Scott pulls off another good movie.My girlfriend who usually does not like such movies thoroughly enjoyed it too.It is a 140minute movie and I was worried it may be too long,but I was so entertained that it felt more like 90 minutes.",Robin Hood

With an all star cast led by Academy Award winners Russel Crowe and Cate Blanclett, they all did an amazing job portraying their characters. The one actor that blew me away was Oscar Isaac who played the arrogant and snobby King John.He put so much enthusiasm in his part that his character looked really believable! Some people say that the film looked somewhat like Gladiator, but that's because Russel Crowe's in it and Ridley Scott directed it. And in case you haven't noticed: All of Ridley Scott's films look the same! However his films never disappointed the audience and the critics.This film takes you back to what Robin Hood was like before he was declared an outlaw, just in case you get confused.Filled with fun action, romance, and humor, Robin Hood's the kind of film that I do recommend others to see and it's worth seeing again in theaters (if you truly loved it for the first time)!",Robin Hood
383,BwSwim,"Not what I was expecting, but not disappointing",7,17 May 2010,"Let me start this review off by letting my bias be known. I love Russel Crowe as an actor, and when Russel Crowe and Ridley Scott teamed up for Gladiator they made one of my favorite movies of all time.With that being said I expected quite a lot from this movie. I also thought I knew the story because of all the other Robin Hood movies that I have seen over the years. This movie was different from any of the other renditions that I have seen. It focuses much more on how Robin Longstride (Crowe) becomes the outlaw Robin Hood, rather than on his life in the forest.In focusing on the formation of Robin Hood Ridley Scott was able to show a new look to an old story. He was also able to create the epic battle scenes that he had used previously in Gladiator.The best part of this movie to me though, was Cate Blanchett. She plays Marian Locksley, the recently widowed wife. She is so good that she takes the focus away and steals the thunder from Russel Crowe.The things that tripped the movie up for me were that the story was a little convoluted and more time could have been spent on developing it. We learn of Robin's past and his father for a short time, and than the idea of that becomes a central factor in the movie. The story develops slowly and than at the end everything happened too fast for my taste.Overall, I think the movie was a decent effort. I enjoyed the new take on an old story. I loved watching Russel Crowe own people on a battlefield again. I liked Cate Blanchett, as Marian, playing an active role not a damsel. I just wish that the story would have been developed more... 7 out of 10",Robin Hood

It's much more cohesive as well as having more 'Robin Hood' stuff. It's just a shame we never got a sequel as the theatrical cut was butchered (as so many under performing movies are) by execs wanting a quicker movie to get more showings in cinemas. Russell Crowe also makes a fantastic battle hardened and weary Robin, Cate Blanchett is a wonderful Marian and the rest of the cast are fantastic, especially his Merry men. Peppered throughout with phrases like 'the more the merrier' this is a more realistic take on the legend, and if you watch the proper version, one of its finest.

Some great actors,great action scenes, great scenery.

But it was unintentionally very very funny.One bit which annoyed me throughout the movie was the bizarre accent Russell Crowe had, it was mixed up combination of Yorkshire, Scouse and I don't know what, many times it sounded like a slurred John Lennon impersonation.Apart from that and the fact it is about as far away from actual history as you can get and the comic Middle Ages military beach landing crafts / boats and lastly the ""Lord of the flies"" children-of-the-forest-army-on-Shetland-pony bits thrown in for an extra giggle...... as I say good for a night out if there is nothing on the tele.Don't know where all the money went in the production. I assume the salary for the cast and not on the movie. More funny than Kevin Kostner version.",Robin Hood

Ridley Scott should be thoroughly ashamed of himself for peddling this trash.",Robin Hood
389,Fennris,I liked all Robin Hood movies until now,5,22 September 2010,"I didn't think that there was any Robin Hood movie that I couldn't like but...The leads were past their prime. This could have been worked around but Cate had unflattering costumes and Russell was too bulky to play a spry character.The score - I keep thinking that it's me and my lack of musical appreciation but every bar felt like it was ""off"". I couldn't recognize any recurring melodies in it. It was frustrating as hell because I really can like this genre and tried to like this.The direction/camera - It was very undisciplined, unfocused (I mean not sticking to the right action from the correct angles, nothing was blurry) and sometimes seemingly random. This didn't seem like a Ridley Scott movie at all.The story - long, complex and humorless. And the narration jumped around with gaps; as long as the movie is, the viewer is expected to fill in numerous blanks and add subtexts from their knowledge of other Robin Hood stories.Inconsistent characters - as an example, sometimes Prince John was channeling Phoenix's role from Gladiator, sometimes he was channeling Prince Humperdink from The Princess Bride... despite a bit of exposition/screen-time in the middle of the movie focusing on him, there was nothing explaining the last 45 min or so. His actions seemed arbitrary; one minute he's comically inept and sympathetic, the next minute he's not. Most of the characters were introduced and then they popped up for some action sequences and disappeared again.Some of the battle sequences were pretty good but there were almost no good fights around/with Robin/Crowe. The Robin - vs - Little John was not a good fight. The action in Robin's final sword-fight/confrontation made no sense to me at all - I think I would need medication to try to explain what happened in that sequence. The only reason this could be called a Robin Hood movie is because of the names of the characters/settings and because they gave Crowe a bow to use in a few scenes, but otherwise there's virtually nothing recognizable about this incarnation. Flipping around some character/place names and a couple minor subplots, they could have called it a King Arthur movie almost as easily as a Robin Hood movie.",Robin Hood

Even the much criticised Crowes accent wasn't a problem; I found it to be just standard Crowe-neutral with a hint of English spin on it.The only problem is that there is nothing that really wow's or surprises the viewer, there's is a feeling that we've seen all this before and that's where it falls short of the other Ridley Scott epics like Gladiator or Alien, these movies showed the viewer something original, exciting, and different. Compounding this issues, it seems as though all the characters seem to be split into two sides - good & evil, with no room for development, this makes their actions predictable for much of the movie.On the Fruit-Meter, Robin Hood gets the 'Apple' – Solid & crisp all the way through, but you know what each bite will taste like, and as a result not so exciting.",Robin Hood
392,floppypig_16,The beginning of a trilogy?,4,10 August 2010,"Forget everything you might know about the original Robin Hood. There are no men prancing merrily around in a forest sporting tights to match the trees or stealing gold from the rich and giving it to the poor. Robin Hood no longer looks like a grown-up Peter Pan and Marion is about as far away from a damsel in distress as you can get. No, Ridley Scott's newest epic is dark, gritty and a whole new take on the old tale. Russell Crowe plays Robin Longstride, an archer in Richard the Lionheart's army who, upon the King's death, sees an opportunity to escape fighting for a cause he does not believe in. By chance, he comes across Sir Robert Loxley, a dying knight who makes him promise to take his sword back to his father, Sir Walter Loxley of Nottingham. On his arrival, Robin becomes involved in Nottingham's over-taxation issues and pillaging attacks by England's new tyrannical King and is forced to take a stand against him and, in the process, become the legendary Robin Hood. Like Batman Begins, 'Robin Hood' it is an origin movie, focused on providing a back story to the fabled ranger. The title is thus quite misleading, as it isn't as much about Robin Hood as it is about how Robin Longstride becomes Robin Hood. The film is, therefore, quite dialogue-heavy and relies on only a few action scenes to keep the story flowing. This works for the most part, providing a solid and entertaining introduction to the legendary hero. What doesn't work is the film's uneven direction. Seemingly, in an attempt to get through as much of the story as possible, certain scenes weren't given enough screen-time. This culminated in characters who, not given the time to generate any real depth, would be left under-developed and shallow. Alternatively, other scenes were drawn out into lengthy discussions that, to be frank, got boring. Put simply, Scott's Robin Hood is a dark and twisted look at the heroic ranger. Despite some issues with direction and moments in the film that are outright boring, the film is fun and entertaining for its lengthy duration. Expect a sequel.",Robin Hood

Well, you expect some smart humor from Robin Hood, don't you? Only the faithful Robin Hood fans would know what I' am talking about. This Robin Hood is single dimensional, boring and irritating at times.And to make the matters worse, the screenplay makes you think if it was still stuck up at the first draft! You really do have time for an easy nap and a coffee(Only if you are willing to spend more cash, as you have already wasted some for the ticket).This film is no where near Gladiator, and is just a piece of visual opalescence. The exhilarating camera work, and war scenes sadly doesn't save the film's plight! Now what do you expect? If you are just that idiotic movie goer, who gets satisfied with those gimmicks they show you, then this is the right choice. Go for this 3 hours of payed torture. Others, please keep out, because there are better films out there, with sleeker running time and most importantly a better screenplay.Now I have a question to ask.

394,ishjtar,A missed chance,6,15 May 2010,"I went to see this movie in the hope to be immerged in the medieval atmosphere for a few hours and to see a story combining intrigue and epic battle in a historical setting. Alas, I was to be disappointed. (1) The battle scenes failed to satisfy my hunger for blood. The siege of the castle was well portrayed by alas too short. The final battle did not come across very epic and missed a tension bow. (2) I do not oppose to humor in a historical movie but here the writers made true caricatures of the sheriff and king John. (3) Lady Marion was clearly inspired by LOTR. A strong woman okay, but actively participating in battle ? Come on, that's just not believable. (4) The philosophical intermezzo with father stonemason being the mind behind the magna charta was just not believable and plain boring. It should not have made the final cut. (5) Some scenes are not believable. Child warriors riding ponies ? All nobles immediately agree to have an unknown man lead their army ? A bowman who wields the sword as good as a trained knight ? (6) The ending of the movie is too Hollywood perfect and therefore lacks dramatic strength. (7) Lastly, because for most readers probably least important : Historical flaws : King Richard took an arrow in the shoulder, not in the throat, and he died several days after, not immediately. In middle ages by superstition people slept sitting instead of lying down. Therefore Marion's bed was too long. Etc. In conclusion : With the same budget but a more intelligent script a far better movie could have been made. A missed chance.",Robin Hood
395,redvers,Now go away or I shall taunt you a second time!,4,28 June 2010,"I really wanted to enjoy this film. Ridley Scott has directed some of my favourite films of all time including Alien, Bladerunner and The Duellists. I love historical epics and quite liked Gladiator - although I must admit that Kingdom of Heaven left me cold. I'm also sadly a stickler for historical accuracy, finding for instance Mel Gibsons efforts in Braveheart and The Patriot just laughable. However, it's not the many historical inconsistencies that dismayed me about this film - I was prepared to cut it a lot of slack given it's a legend. The film started out promisingly enough with the siege of the french castle and I was even entertained by the scenes in which Robin returns the crown and eventually meets Marian. It was in the latter stages of the film that it all started getting a bit too silly. Who on earth made the farcical decision that Marian and the Lost Boys should take part in the final clash of arms? The image of them riding into battle on their ponies would have been better suited to Narnia. Then onto the french in their 'landing craft'. They were just terrible caricatures along the lines of the soldiers taunting King Arthur in Monty Pythons The Holy Grail. I half expected them to catapult a cow onto the beach. Finally, the last bow shot by Robin was lifted straight out of Tom & Jerry and should have been accompanied by a 'wheeeeee...ponk' sound effect. It's as if the script writer just gave in and threw everything but the kitchen sink into the end of the film. I so wanted to like it, but unfortunately it's another GI Jane in Ridley Scotts body of work. I'll stick with Errol Flynns version for pure entertainment.",Robin Hood
396,r1msky,Nice and funny,6,27 October 2015,"That's not how i usually headline reviews to historical movies, especially Ridley Scott's movies with Russell Crowe starring. But this is the exception. This is a historical tale, well filmed, quite fascinating, but just one-time tale. IMHO there is not enough action and character development here. Some parts of the film are just dull and passive, you wouldn't understand why they added it.But, fortunately, there is a bright side too. I can say one will find a very unusual, nonstandard approach in showing the story of Robin Hood here. You will realize it in the very end. That's perhaps the best thing about the movie. Overall it is worth watching, but don't expect to see something outstanding and spectacular. It is rather nice and funny",Robin Hood
397,jen5en,"Confused, amused... but mostly entertained.",8,13 May 2010,"Robin Hood. I usually associate him with a bare-assed Kevin Costner and Bryan Adams, a forest, lots of arrows flying and typical 90's clichés. However, on the poster it seemed none of this would be present. Instructed by Ridley Scott and starring Russell Crowe? Frankly, I didn't know what the hell to expect going in. A mix between Robin Hood and Gladiator maybe?First off, I would say that it was a weird experience that I haven't fully recovered from. It's a 140 min. movie and yet it felt short. Despite being quite slow in it's narrative, with only two major battle scenes, I never felt bored in any way. It's quite gory from time to time, yet indulges in goofy comedy and penis jokes occasionally.It is beautiful though and the performances are memorable. It just feels... bland and yet exceptional. Dull and yet intriguing. I didn't really care much for what was going on, yet I was glued to the screen and didn't check my watch. A bit like watching Alexander. Or Kingdom of Heaven. It feels like watching a bunch of LARP'ers in a forest essentially, but cool, good-looking LARP'ers with expensive costumes.But Robin Hood you say? Frankly, calling it ""Longstride"" wouldn't have made any difference to me. It's about a man coming home to England to deliver the message of the king's demise, then things go haywire.If you feel confused about my ramblings I don't blame you. I'm as confused as you are. Because I don't really know what to say, so I'll be blunt. It felt like just another 'epic' movie. Posh British accents? Check. Cheesy speeches about liberty and freedom, with bombastic music? Check. Questionable CGI castles? Check. BUT, I managed to be engaging and intriguing. Hell, I couldn't remember one damn scene from Alexander and yet I remember whole dialogs from Robin Hood - which is quite an achievement.So all in all, a typical epic movie with Robin Hood slapped on top of it. Great cinema to be sure and an experience to be remembered. I can't really give anything other than 8/10. Nice one Mr. Scott. I think.",Robin Hood

Ridley Scott directing a great adventure with a very solid cast and a high budget.The movie didn't really start the way I thought it would. The pace was quite slow but very interesting, and I was gripped. The interaction between Robin and his fellow soldiers was quite believable and entertaining, and the story about the English crown succession was also nicely done.The entire chapter about Nottingham and its citizens is also at a nice and slow pace, but its never dull. Von sydow is a pleasure to see as usual, and both Crowe and Cate Blanchett delivers. You just sit and smile, when things suddenly goes very very wrong...It starts when Walter Loxley explains Robins past to him. The scene is rushed and it seems a bit far-fetched. Also the following scene when robin goes to the meeting of the barons. Ridley must at this time peeked at his watch and noticed that he let most of the movie pass without telling much, and start to massacre the script.The Nottingham action scene is where it's starting to go seriously wrong. You can't really get to understand how Robin suddenly is in command of an army, and speaking to lords as their equal. Especially when they call him by his common name in a scene later. The pace is really off here too... Action scene-Action scene-Short grief scene- Love scene- And on horseback against the French again in a 5min gap. Set in contrast to the feelgood mode you were in this is a very rude awakening.After this you are handed a fighting scene that is absurd in every way. The landing craft is from WW2 (what possible use does the landing bridge have on these boats?). The battle is a slaughter, the French never stand a chance(not very interesting). When suddenly Marion appears on the beach with the local teenage runaways on ponies I just shake my head... why?! It's just stupid?! Also they seem to be trained by ninjas and easily takes on trained French soldiers.There is an ending after, but its thrown together in five minutes.In one line.This movie had a lot of potential, but it's thrown away on hasted parts and plain stupid scenes.",Robin Hood
400,robthompson,Excellent reinvention of an old story,9,5 September 2010,"I was dreading watching this film since I was worried it was going to be another rehash of an already tired story. This version was a refreshing reinvention of that legend. Every character has been created anew so the tale never falls into well-worn territory. As well the film actually sought to tell a story as opposed to rely on wall-to-wall action sequences. Ridley Scott is adept at using visuals to pull you into the world he is creating and this film does not disappoint in that department. The acting is strong across the board and Crowe and Blanchett were in top form. As long as you're not looking for that same old Robin Hood story, then you will probably enjoy this rather loose historical fiction with a dash of swashbuckler thrown in.",Robin Hood
401,Cole_Thornton,An archer who became a general. A general who became an outlaw. A outlaw who defied an king.,6,23 September 2010,"Russell Crowe (Robin Longstride) garners the affection of an elder fatherly figure of nobility (a la Richard Harris in Gladiator) and rises to command an army that wins a battle for king and country, but is then betrayed by the newly appointed King (who suddenly decides to put himself before country). C'mon, have you seen this Ridley Scott/Russell Crowe movie before? The only thing missing was Joaquin Phoenix in the role of Commodus...errrKing John.How about this for a similar tagline: An archer who became a general. A general who became an outlaw. A outlaw who defied an king.Max Van Sydow was great as the Marcus Aurelius type character and there really were no bad performances. This was a well-photographed, high production value, sweeping epic much like Gladiator for three quarters of the film. The lead up and development of Robin Longstride was interesting to a point and there are many films that take a story that worked once and rework it into a different period of time or add a new twist.But what was really different here, and because of an apparent lack of a better ending, a medieval version of the beach-landing from Saving Private Ryan was shoved in as the token final action scene – filmed complete with Higgins Boats and bloody underwater scenes (with arrows this time, instead of bullets). Then it was almost like the production staff had an epiphany and realized that the name of the movie was ""Robin Hood"" and that they were running out of time - because it wasn't until about the last minute that something about ""Robin of the Hood"" was mentioned. Also, there was no explanation for King John's sudden falling-out with General Maximus Longstride or why he was not present (or captured) at the signing of what was assumed to be the Magna Carta.There were plenty of shots that could have been edited for time to allow for a better ending and hopefully there will not be any sequel to this poorly butchered movie.If you liked Gladiator and the beach-landing scene in Saving Private Ryan, you will probably like the director's cut of this movie on rental.",Robin Hood

This is another hoax and we are all tired of seeing a re-invented story specially that there's no context to support it.1.

404,salmasboy,"""Zero Star""? This is all about criteria...",5,8 September 2010,"OK I get it. I've read several (dozens) reviews for Robin Hood and there is a theme to most of them. Historical and geographical inaccuracies, bad accents, slow pace, too many plot lines, lack of character development, dislike of Russell Crowe, and my favorite; the lack of a ""zero star"" IMDb rating. I, like all of us on here like movies and the opportunity to rate and review them. I also like the opportunity to read others' reviews to decide if a movie is watchable. Usually the masses are correct and prove to be after I see a film. I almost never find myself in the position to submit a review. This time I thought I'd throw in my two cents. I'm from America. I don't know how long it takes to get from France to England by sail boat and I don't know what the boats looked like ca. 1200 ad. I don't know what weapons were commonly used at that time either. I can't tell the difference between British accents any more than I can deduce Northern and Southern Vietnamese. I do know some things. I know that this is obviously a prequel. I know that many of the straying plot lines and character development will be tied up in the second (if there's a go to be one) and/or third movie of the series. I know some people just don't like Russell Crowe. I tend to like his roles and I liked him in this film. Not every Robin has to be flirty and fancy. The one thing I know for absolutely certain is that Robin Hood does not deserve the ""zero star"". The Happening deserves the zero star, but Robin Hood does not. Look, I know it's long, it's inaccurate and the accents are bad. The same can be said for Braveheart which is in everyones top 20. I'm just saying that my criteria for a movie is if I was entertained. That's why I watch movies. My life doesn't have to be changed by every flick I watch. If historical accuracy is your main goal then watch documentaries. I don't need the earth to tremble every time the credits roll. Was Robin Hood the greatest movie since Ted Case put sound to film??

I'm sure you'll understand my review anyways.I had high hopes for this movie. I love the Robin Hood story and like most of the actors in this movie. The good thing about the movie is that it brings a more realistic perspective to the legend of Robin Hood, his life and the life of his contemporaries in England. The bad thing however is the length of the movie and incredible lack of action. The plot is good, until you notice all the leaks in it. Like when they started calling him Robin instead of Robert and King John must have had some other reasons for his outrage at Robin except for some hurt feelings.The ""epic"" war scenes are not epic at all and make very little sense, and you only see Robin wield a bow on two occasions ... which is really saddening considering that he is famous for his incredible skill with the bow. The character building is only decent but the acting is good enough, after all these are actors of the highest caliber. You can just see it in the movie, there is something lacking. I had the same expectations for Robin Hood as I did for Sherlock Holmes. Sherlock Holmes didn't disappoint me at all, but Robin Hood disappointed mainly because of the unexplained things in the plot, lack of action, silliness, unrealistic war scenes and weird heroic moments with Russel Crowe in slow motion.

If you want great ancient battles you would be better off watching Troy or Lord of The Rings. The problem is: this version of Robin Hood doesn't have good dramatic scenes or a great romance in it to compensate the lack of action, which makes it a pretty boring movie to watch at times. It is definitely not a movie about an outlaw who fights against the rich for the poor, like the trailer makes you think. Robin Hood is portrayed as a boring man who simply fights alongside the rich to defend his country.So where was the passion, the action, the romance, the drama, the blood, like Gladiator could deliver?

409,themoviemavens,Left me nostalgic for Gladiator,7,19 June 2010,"I'll start out by saying that I'm only anecdotally familiar with the story of Robin Hood. Although the Kevin Costner version came out when I was a teenager, and I loved the Bryan Adams theme like every other teenage girl, I never actually got around to seeing that version of the story. And even though I'm a huge classic film buff, I've never seen the Errol Flynn film either.So, I came into this experience with fresh eyes. Now, you don't approach a Ridley Scott/Russel Crowe collaboration expecting it to be bad. I knew I was in for a quality piece of film making. And I knew there would be inevitable comparisons to Gladiator, the first (and career-making) collaboration between the two. And I'll say right off, if were making the comparison, Robin Hood left me a little nostalgic for Gladiator.Since the plot was a bit, shall we say, involved, I'll share some insights rather than providing a blow-by-blow synopsis of the movie. This film plays heavily on themes of mistaken identity, lost identity, co-opted identity, etc. We learn about how and why Robin Hood became the man he is. Although, I don't believe we're ever told exactly how he, in his heart, would come to provide the premise for this twisted moral tale. I guess I was looking for a concrete reason why he would begin stealing from the rich to give to the poor. If you're going to bother giving us the man's back story, why not include something about the state in which he grew up? Did he come from poverty? When we meet Robin Hood, he's a hired hand – a mercenary fighting in the rebellion against then Prince John. Through a series of sometimes confusing events, he eventually ends up impersonating the dead husband of Maid Marion, Robert of Loxley, who has been killed by the nefarious Godfrey, a double agent who's actually working with Prince Phillip of France to invade England.I have to say, I was a little troubled that many of the villainous characters in this film had a strangely Middle Eastern look about them. I found it quite odd that King John vaguely resembled Uday Hussein, when in fact, he would have been about as WASPy as they come. Now, I realize that actor Oscar Isaac is actually Guatemalan, but I don't think the casting was any accident. Neither, in my opinion, was the casting of his erstwhile cohort, Godfrey, played by British actor Mark Strong. Although he is Italian and Austrian, he could also play ""Terrorist #2"" in any given shoot-em-up, America Kicks Foreign Butt, patriot-fest.This, to me, is the glaring failing of this film. It's something I would expect out of the 1938 version, but if you're going to bother to tear apart and reassemble the story, and all of its characters to suit moder-day sensibilities and expectations, why play into such rote stereotypes? And speaking of reinterpreting characters, Maid Marion has been transformed into something of a modern-day feminist hero. Played by the terribly underrated Cate Blanchett, she doesn't sulk and swoon and wait for the hero to come to her rescue.

410,Optimus_,A great director+two great actors+a classic story to start from => COMPLETE CRAP,5,16 May 2010,"Someone here said that the last 30 minutes turned a strong 9+ movie into a poor 6- movie. I'd say he was extremely generous with the first two hours of this film!First, this Robin Hood isn't the classic story (as it can be found in Ivanhoe and in the 1938 movie). This shouldn't necessarly be something bad, but the movie's new Robin Hood plot also fails miserably in being historically accurate. And, in the end, the plot also makes little to no sense from start to finish.I don't mind someone reinventing a Robin Hood, I can even deal with it being so historically inaccurate, but I really don't want to watch movies with logical goofs all over the place.Add to this the fact that Russell Crowe looks extremely bored trough most of the movie, and you'll get the full picture of this failure called Robin Hood. Sure, Cate Blanchett gives it a try, but is far from shining at her best, and Max von Sydow's part is way too small to make his formidable acting really count. Mark Strong tries hard but his role is so unidimensional and dull that it gives him no chance.Overall the movie is a 5+ or 6- but nothing more.",Robin Hood

An outstanding film adaptation that spends little time in being unrealistically happy and digs deep into the realistically portrayed wartime England. Unfortunately, the emotional response was not as strong as I feel it should have been given it's outstanding soundtrack. A great war epic no doubt but drags on a bit too long than comfortable. Russel Crowe is perfect(as always) as the legendary hero. Cate Blanchette brings a pretty good performance as Lady Marion but is a bit too independent to be a British woman.

Instead of being the man who steals from the rich and gives to the poor, he was the man who has a deep forgotten past and decides to pretend to be someone else.Second the Sheriff of Nottingham was a wimpy loser. The original sheriff was a dangerous dictator who everyone feared. This guy would not be able to make me give up a dollar if he threatened me.Third the two kings who are in the movie. Richard the lion heart is supposed to be this honourable, valiant leader. He was supposed to be loved and respected by all in his kingdom. In the movie he was rude, angry and unfair. He put Robin in the stockade for telling him his true feelings. Also, he does not die in the original story. King John is supposed to be the unfair, terrible cruel ruler, but in this version he essentially does what his wife wants.This movie was completely terrible. It was slow, long, and boring.

What a steaming pile of rotting fish.,2,20 May 2010,"It's a shame to see so much acting talent (and I don't mean Crowe) wasted on this story.The script turns both history and all the familiar elements of the story on their heads, and pointlessly so -- nothing is gained.The only thing in common with the Robin Hood stories you know are the settings, the names, and the costumes.First, Robin isn't Robin -- he's a lowly archer who assumes the role of a dead person.The ""merry men"" don't live in Sherwood Forest.Maid Marian isn't a ""maiden.""The Sheriff is a big sleaze but not a real factor in the film.King Richard is dead before the Crusades end.""Robin"" meets ""Little John"" over a shell game, rather than on a bridge.The fight scenes are unoriginal, uninspired, and uninteresting.The plot line is disjointed, at best.The film is more about ""French treachery"" than tyranny (maybe it's not OK to talk about tyranny is U.S. theaters these days?) -- especially funny since, historically, King Richard I was more ""French"" than ""English"" and exploited England exactly as the French in this film planned to do.Phththth.

415,alex-ogden,"Well done, not perfect, but under-appreciated",7,3 December 2012,"Ridley Scott's Robin Hood, is a different look and spin on the Robing Hood story/legacy. INSTEAD of taking you on a wild ride, following the Robin Hood story, mythology you know he takes a different approach. He gives you with a darker, gritter, realistic Robin Hood before he was the infamous thief and outlaw we know to day. I think this is were people start to dislike it. Many will go into this movie with expectations of a generic and formulaic traditional Robin Hood story. With Robin and his band of Merry Men stealing from the rich giving to the poor and wearing leotards. But that is not what we get, far from it. We start of with, what is now an aging Russel Crowe, who almost seems to be perfect personification. While his dialogue may seem cheese at times, or his voice hard to understand, Crowe (Robin) delivers his lines with believability, you could believe and envision him as the craft archer himself. Cate Blanchett provides a sassy, smart, strong willed and independent Marion Loxely. While her relationship with Crowe maybe a bit of a stretch to believe, the Director's Cut adds a few scenes making the stretch lessen, but quite a bit. The rest of the is well picked, Oscar Issac does a fantastic job as Prince John, probably the best acted part in the whole movie. he score when really heard is quite good. The story is well written, mostly solid with a few minor gaps. Over all, to truly appreciate it you should go in open minded, not expecting a traditional Robin Hood tale, and let Ridley Scott unfold the untold story of Robin Hood.7.5/10 PS. the best way to watch it is to see the Director's Cut, it adds to the story filling some gaps, and making the experience more enjoyable.",Robin Hood

418,scvkiowa,"Gritty, Dirty Vision of a Legend's Genesis",4,12 March 2015,"The prospect of an acclaimed director like Ridley Scott taking on such a revered, popular story like Robin Hood was an intriguing one, and, I'll admit, I was excited to see this movie before it hit theaters. For whatever reason, I never did get around to seeing this one in the years since it fell into Cineplexes with a fart. I don't know why I never got around to it, but I suspect I caught wind of its, um, quality and stayed away.I do have to commend the filmmakers for choosing something different in telling Robin Hood's origins as an outlaw over the same ""rob from the rich, give the poor"" song and dance. We've seen that covered in a variety of films ranging from Erroll Flynn, Disney and even Mel Brooks, so a fresh take on the legend is much appreciated. Sadly, for all its good points, the film is a mostly joyless, bloated experience that delivers very little of the fun that Robin Hood is noted for.There aren't many exciting bits in this movie and the middle portion, which gets caught up in the socio-political struggles of England's royalty are practically soul-draining in its length and turgidity. Russell Crowe plays Robin Hood in his usual grousing manner, and he comes off well when not asked to give monologues or show any emotion that isn't bitter annoyance. One of the biggest problems here is that Crowe's Robin is a cantankerous, joyless man, and the movie follows suit with the character.Scott does a superb job bringing the medieval setting to life with plenty of dirty battle scenes, squalid villages and dingy castles, giving the story a more realistic tone than one normally associated with the character. The problem is that there's nothing to alleviate the constant drab scenery and oppressively dreary mood. I guess I've always assumed that people would go to a Robin Hood movie to have fun... Scott apparently doesn't think so! He even works in the crusades even though he firmly beat that horse to death in ""Kingdom of Heaven"". If you study poetry, you learn that you can be both sentimentally sweet or sentimentally bitter and neither is a good thing; sweet and bitter need each other for balance in order to properly reflect that tone of life. ""Robin Hood"" is practically off the scale in bitterness. There is no fun to be had here; there are only miserable people doing miserable things to each other.What really stinks is that this thing is over two hours long! Yep, two hours of absolute pessimism and crankiness. When looking at the various iterations the Robin Hood character has gone through in Hollywood, he's been treated fairly well in comparison to many other myth figures; however, this version is a big-budget yawn that starts off with a lot of intriguing ideas and then proceeds to bludgeon the audience over the head with the notion that everything in their world is horrible and there is no hope beyond a grizzled jerk that scowls through his hopeful soliloquy.So, I hope you can understand why I'm not recommending this well-made, technically proficient film.1.5 out of 4",Robin Hood
419,ChessLeveller,Atrocious and predictable - predictably atrocious,3,1 June 2010,"This version of Robin Hood is one of the worst examples of the current trend in epic film-making. It is absurdly overblown, massively un-historical and fails utterly to offer any new perspective on the Robin Hood legend or the England of the late twelfth century, which it totally misrepresents in both its social and political aspects. I feared the worst and my expectations were not disappointed. The story makes little sense and bears no relationship to the actual events of the period - there was no French invasion and the foreshadowing of Magna Carta is preposterously anachronistic in its portrayal of the political arguments. King John is ridiculously caricatured and doesn't convince for one second as the real John. The attempts at humour fall flat, Russell Crowe's accent is indeed all over the place, but mainly in Ireland as has been said, and people's accents generally seem diverse to say the least. Cinematically it is a complete mish-mash of styles, but there is far to much CGI and the whole thing has an inappropriately metallic look to it, like a contemporary thriller set in the USA not an historical epic set in the English countryside of the 1190s. SPOILER ALERT The climactic scene of the French invasion looks like 'Braveheart' meets 'Saving Private Ryan' - taking the brilliantly conceived and executed scenes from those movies and bastardising them to fit into this vastly inferior one. How can as fine a director as Ridley Scotrt perpetrate this abomination!",Robin Hood
420,jdmu7,Saints preserve us...,3,18 May 2010,"First let me state the good aspects of the film.And now that we've dealt with that, here's what went wrong. The cardinal sin of this production was the acting (or lack thereof) from every principal member of the cast. Two Australians were handed the main roles, one (Blanchett) doing a solid impression of an English accent while Crowe's imitation hovered in quality between downright awful and Dick Van Dyke. Also, the Welshman looked and sounded Scots/Irish/Klingon while the fourth ""merry man,"" who's name I can't recall ever being mentioned, was decidedly American. Expanding our critique of the acting from just the accents, I have rarely seen a character with less depth than Crowe's take on Robin Hood. No affectation, no plausible back story and simply no distinction whatsoever. A character such as Robin Hood would have charisma and personality. Crowe was the inverse. Second on the hit list, the story-line (without dropping in any spoilers). This is a film that had one of the greatest folk legends to draw upon, a depth of material and detail not commonly found. Instead, Ridley Scott decided to deviate and invent his own version which shared almost none of the common elements of the standard version(s). This sudden outburst of originality would've been excused if there was some phenomenal acting but sadly its absence just compounded by already negative view of the film. I have never seen a great film adaptation of Robin Hood. Or rather, a dramatic rendition. Men in Tights was dynamite. This is because a legend like that of Robin Hood requires an extraordinary amount of detail and time to do justice in its retelling. And yet, 2hrs 40min was far too long for this film. Anyone wishing to see a truly great adaptation of Robin Hood, one that has such broad depth of acting and scripting, beautifully shot, faithful to much of the old tales but successfully modernized, you must turn to the television. Namely, the BBC series from 2006-09. Great actors are capable of defining roles for a generation. For example, Basil Rathbone's Sherlock Holmes and Jeremy Brett's version some 50 years later. Jonas Armstrong is very much the modern Robin Hood. I would go so far as to say he is the best ever, better even than Flynn, Richard Greene, or the aforementioned Rathbone. Likewise Keith Allen is the supreme portrayer of the Sheriff, genuinely one of the most evil yet darkly hilarious performances I've ever seen. The series has charm as well as tragedy. In fact, every part of the series, from its music to its costumes has the beating of its counterpart in this massive-budget squib. Andy Price's score alone does more for exposition than any of Russell Crowe's wooden clichés. Best of all, the TV version has no dodgy accents.",Robin Hood
421,violet_raven,Biased review by a lifelong Robin Hood fangirl,9,22 May 2021,"So, I'm never not going to like a Robin Hood movie (except that 2018 travesty I deleted from my brain). This one comes with plenty of flaws, but I forgive it much because of the way the classic tale is spun in this iteration.I rated it a 10 by default at the title screen and then deducted points as I went along. The artwork and music go a long way to setting up for the epic scope, in much the same way as Gladiator. We must remember this is a film designed for the masses, so if it's going to bother you that you end up enjoying something popular, keep your inherent bias in mind as you trash it. I'd love to think of myself as someone who appreciates artistry and rejects popular culture, but at heart I'm an incorrigible romantic, and it doesn't get more romantic than this age old story of rich vs poor, underdog vs establishment, thief vs the law.One point immediately deducted for the historically inaccurate flaming arrows. However, it's rescued from being a total write-off in the opening scene by Cate Blanchett's portrayal of a strong, defiant Marion. No damsel in distress here (and later we'll see Robin isn't exactly the hero, or rather is the precise type of hero she deserves).If you've ever tried to draw a longbow, or rescue a stuck sheep, you immediately get the flavour for her strength and character, which she carries consistently throughout. This is a no-nonsense woman in an impossible situation, carrying the weight of responsibility to an estate she married into, with very little payoff in terms of romance, but who has a personal investment in the people and the land. She invests herself in fully, instead of taking the wilting maiden role of pining wife for absent husband. In fact, her reaction to bad news is one of the main reasons I rate this film so highly. I saw it in the cinema and it stuck with me for years as one of the most accurate portrayals of heart-deep wounding I've ever seen on screen. She doesn't cry, she doesn't throw herself to the ground. She does what many of us have done in the face of heartbreak. She keeps going.The scriptwriting deserves a mention, I love the little witticisms between Marion and Robin; their playful antagonism, as well as their awkwardness. There's a sort of innocence to their romance I feel is very human, after all they are both people who have had leadership roles thrust upon them restricting their lives and removing the possibility of poetic and youthful courtship, instead they've each risen to their challenges with their native charisma and dedication to their respective cause, while having little time for the poetic notions of ballad and saga. I personally fall for this every time, to the degree I'm giving an extra star back, in spite of the other major flaw; Russell Crowe's accent(s), I didn't count them all but he included as many as possible. It was almost as bad as watching Highlander or Braveheart but I can overlook it in this film more easily since I'm Scottish. It may severely irritate English audiences though. There were also a few fun lines I'd have missed without subtitles, so worth checking those if you're not a native English speaker.More on why this is one of my favourite romances, since this is already a personal review, and having warned you of my biases already. Robin says those 3 words precisely once, in the most relatable of circumstances; right when he's leaving so he doesn't have to stick around for a response, and with a fair chance he might be dead before he has to find out what she thinks. Mortal peril aside, since this is no longer Medieval England, I feel like this scene evokes a sense of true-to-life love, because it's clearly harder for him to speak his heart-even as someone who's already faced the stocks for his brutal honesty to his king-than it is for him to face any number of physically dangerous situations. It's one of the few movies with a relatable, complex, admirable female lead, and a man I'd actually want to fall in love with. You'd be surprised how few of those are out there.I particularly like the dynamic in their next meeting which sets the tone for entire partnership ""For gods' sake Marion!"" with a heavy implication of ""wtf are you doing?!"" which is exactly the type of romantic dialogue I paid good money to hear. I get a laugh out of this every time, but maybe this is because I'm a hotheaded archer with a tendency towards impulsive descisions.Also, let's have a moment of appreciation for the hair stylist who actually seems to understand how long hair works and what's practical for someone who has to work every day instead of being dressed and styled by an army of maids. We again deduct that one point for Russell Crowe having short hair, but again this is personal bias because I'm a sucker for long hair.I'm sold on their team effort and the relationship that forms (however unlikely given the historical context) of equals on their particular battlefield. He realised pretty quickly that he can't lord it over her, so he treats her as a comrade. This is not just shown in his relationship to Marion, but a personality trait consistent with his, and her, interactions with the lost boys/band of merry men in the greenwood.It's total fantasy of course, I've never met a man with all these qualities at once, plus being a hell of a shot with a longbow, but maybe that's why I'm watching it by myself at 4am contemplating a second watching and/or secondary tankard of mead. It's not meant to be a history, or any kind of profound philosophical treatise, but it's got charm, wit, entertainment and romance of the sort I can palate.It also gets massive points for not having a wedding scene and no implications of children in the future, but rather a found-family dynamic. I feel this to be a significant, often overlooked, archetype that most films won't use because the traditional happy ending requires a ceremony and family. For those of us who can't or won't, this is important to see in mainstream film.In summary, I've always been in love with the concept of Robin Hood I'm glad they finally gave him a Marion he deserves.Side note, I watched the extended cut and the deleted scenes, which are well worth it especially for deepening the appreciation for the relationship with Marion and her father-figure. Again it goes to illustrate family by choice, not by blood.There was a lot else to say about this film but most other reviews covered its legitimate downfalls, and I'm in a sappy mood so you're only getting an essay on the romance. If any of my stalkers ever traces me here, I'd prefer a bouquet of arrows and a pack of wolfhounds than whatever else you're offering. For anyone else who read this far and is taken with the idea of Marion having dimension as a character-as does Eleanor it must be noted-I recommend The Forest Wife by Theresa Tomlinson for a good literary portrayal.",Robin Hood
422,deeppak,The making of the Outlaw,3,24 May 2010,"I went to watch this movie hoping to see a 21st century version of Kevin Costner's ""Robin Hood: Prince of Thieves"". Was hoping to see the superhero type outlaw Roin Hood. And above all, it was directed by Ridley Scott and starred Russel Crowe, obviously making me expect a Gladiator like quality in the movie. Yes, the quality of filming and story telling are good. But the movie was not interesting.The character of the evil King was not framed well. He didn't convince me about the degree of evilness in him and I had to force myself to hate him. Little John wasn't a well portrayed character and I thought Kevin Durand was hired for the role taking into account that his character would be rendered unimportant. And, sadly, Robin Hood didn't appear to be a great character. This movie is about the outlaw's life before he became an outlaw. It is about the time Robin Hood was on the King's side and how he turned into an outlaw. But what disappointed me most was that I went to watch this movie in 2010 and felt that if the screenplay for this movie was written in 1980 and made into a movie in the same year, it would still look exactly like how Mr. Scott made it in 2010. Nothing out of the ordinary, nothing spectacular, nothing much to keep the audience interested. Even though the story is not about the usual outlaw Robin Hood that most of us have read growing up, it could have been made more interesting if the film makers decided not to try to make an actual historical account of what made the soldier an outlaw. I can watch the History Channel if I wanted historical information. When I go to a movie theater to watch Robin Hood, I want to be pushed to the edge of my seat and occasionally crack into laughter at some ancient British humor. This one however was a complete waste of my time and money. I will give it 3 stars only because Ridley Scott directed it.",Robin Hood

Although movie could last a bit shorter, as some scenes tend to last too long i enjoyed whole movie, despite it slow pace at times.Now, story. I see Robin Hood as a tale, fantasy, not a history movie, and so i can enjoy it. I can understand why some people can dislike it as some things are rather unrealistic for that history set up and it especially goes for the last battle scene when a bunch of runaway boys led by lady Marion kick some French soldiers which is against any common sense.Action scenes aren't badly filmed, although there's a notable absence of blood, probably due to rating. Still, i've enjoyed them, with that last battle on the beach maybe being the most unrealistic thing in whole movie. Cast is solid, but nothing special, with Cate Blanchett being one or several levels above the others.I couldn't decide to give it 6 or 7, but eventually went with 7. That is, if you look at it as an action tale, if you think about it as a historic movie, you probably won't like it, as Robin does some pretty unrealistic things (like very good sword battle for an archer, acting as a noble etc.). I've expected such things as Robin Hood is just a tale with some fantastic elements and didn't get disappointed in the end.This is actually some mix between the prequel and ""regular"" story, i liked the way story was told, i liked the action scenes, and it's light film to watch when you have time and want relaxation.",Robin Hood

427,med4526,Robin Hood...begins,9,28 July 2011,"Pretty much this is an origin hero movie following the positive vibes of Batman Begins.First of all, the storyline and the background of the heroes are significantly changed compared to the previous versions of Robin Hood. Ridley Scott approached the legend in a more complicated, deep and meaningful way. Robin Lonstride has a story to tell, he went through a lot of situations and events in order to become the legend we know of.Russel Crowe, a superb actor in my opinion, is the most capable guy to bring this story to the audience and unveil the character. The rest of the cast is quite good. Cate Blanchett performs well without exaggerations and leaves you with a calm and warm feeling of the loving wife. Mark Strong is exceptional as the bad guy, mostly because of his cold look in his face and the tone of his voice. The costumes, landscapes and music were good but nothing special. The same old historical movie theme. Directing was really nice with emphasis on important events and, thankfully, not tiring everlasting battles that confuses the audience. Duration of the movie was spot-on although 2 and a half hours, enough to unveil the characters and in my opinion it never felt to linger at any part.Overall, continuing the succession of ""...begins""-type of hero movies Robin Hood is an excellent choice if you want a hero movie that digs into the character and explains a lot about how he ended up being the legend. 9/10",Robin Hood
428,cjgarrett-1,I Hate to do This,5,16 April 2020,"I saw this film in theaters when I was a teenager. Being a huge fan of Ridley Scott at the time, I thoroughly enjoyed the movie. After rewatching the movie ten years later, it unfortunately does not hold up. It lacks the emotional weight of Gladiator, with Russell Crowe going through the motions of being a righteous hero. A solid, but standard performance. The action scenes are also rather tame; due to the hefty $200 million budget, the studio was clearly aiming for a PG-13 rating, hence why I was able to go see it with my friends. While the score and cinematography is solid, the movie lacks the stylish flare and beauty of Scott's other epics: Kingdom of Heaven and the at-times cheesy 1492: Conquest of Paradise. Cate Blanchett and Russell Crowe have very little chemistry, and very little is known about Robin Hood's merry men even after they're introduced. Max von Sydow and Mark Strong are terrific, and I wish Mark Strong was able to do more in his role. Oscar Isaac is perfect as a rather annoying prince in the vain of Joaquin Phoenix in Gladiator. Unfortunately the script struggles due to the need to set up a franchise rather than tell a great epic story: the movie was caught up in the beginnings of the franchise/sequel/reboot trend set by Batman Begins, Casino Royale and Iron Man.

A few points - ignoring any historical inaccuracies (of which there are plenty).1) There appeared to be only one character (Godfrey) who could speak English intelligibly, accents of Robin Hood and Little John were quite laughable (Crowe darted between North Yorkshire, Liverpool and Ireland) and I have no idea which part of the world Little John was supposed to come from. 2) Maid Marion – a very hammy performance and legend does not ever mention her super-human strength; have you ever tried to bend a modern longbow replica? Very hard even for a large bloke and they have about half the draw weight of the real thing, and I had no idea that Wendy and the lost boys were involved in the legend of Robin Hood. 3) The final battle scene was taken more or less directly from Saving Private Ryan and included replica landing craft, one of the daftest scenes in cinema for quite some time. 4) There is so much information about concerning archer's other weapons of that era there was no need to invent a long sledge hammer 5) Why call the film Robin Hood?

430,BarrisDarkly,A genre best,10,13 June 2010,"Braveheart, Gladiator, Troy, Alexander, King Arthur. What do they all have in common? They're sword and sandals that don't hold a candle to Robin Hood. At least in my book. Since everyone has a different opinion on movies, I believe we can all agree this review will be limited to my OPINION. And my opinion is this the best sword and sandal epic.It has its flaws and clichés, as foes every single sword and sandal, a genre of which I am not a fan. There is the immaculate hero, the pure evil villain, and the script has about as much depth as the characters in it. HOWEVER: what Robin Hood does have is excellent directing, fantastic cinematogrpahy, all-around good acting, and a score that had better win the damned Oscar.I frequently see changes I would make, directing-wise, writing-wise, or casting-wise, when watching sword and sandals. But the only thing I would change about Robin Hood are the male and female leads. I understand that this is a revisioning of Robin Hood, but I still feel that Jude Law (who has played Errol Flynn, the man whose 1930's portrayal of Robin Hood set the standard) would have been an infinitely better choice. Which is not to say Russell Crowe does bad - on the contrary, this is my favorite of his performances. It's just, for a character like Robin Hood, Jude Law actually fits the part, physically. For most of the film I found myself envisioning Jude Law starring instead of Crowe. And for most of the film I imagined various actresses as Marion, Cate Blanchett's character. Keira Knightley and Emily Blunt mostly. Yes, Cate Blanchett is a fantastic actress. She is also very plain, looks-wise. And her character is not one of depth, but rather merely eye candy. And like Maggie Gyllenhaal as Rachel Dawes in The Dark Knight, you don't need a good actress for an eye candy character. As Katie Holmes proved, playing Rachel Dawes in Batman Begins, you simply need someone attractive.Also, there is an actor that I could not only not imagine any other actor playing his part, but I also plan to follow this actor's career now. That is Oscar Isaac as Prince John. In Isaac we see what Jaoquin Phoenix could have been in Gladiator. And if Robin Hood is an Oscar-favorite like Gladiator was, then by all means Oscar Isaac deserves a Best Supporting Actor nomination.Other actors were a delight to see: Mark Strong, The Guy from A Knight's Tale, the man who plays the French farmer at the start of Inglourious Basterds.All in all, Robin Hood is the best movie of the summer so far, and if you see only one sword and sandal epic in your life, I suggest it be Robin Hood.",Robin Hood
431,Sinan_Ozel,Big disappointment,3,13 May 2010,"Wonderful and rationalized version of Robin Hood with bad music and awful cameras and above average art direction....Ridley Scott tries to follow in the footsteps of the last Batman movies, and trying to repeat their success formula: RATIONALIZATION of an irrational story. Remember; suddenly Batman is not that unreal anymore, even his weapons and his talents seem to make reason. And here we have the same formula applied to Robin Hood. In this movie we are explained the reasons why Robin has suddenly so many followers, we are provided with a rational explanation of his proximity to the folk and the authority. And the story of Magna Carta incorporated to the legend of Robin Hood strengthens this rationalization even more. So far so good...However I was disappointed because of the following reasons: 1. The positioning of the cameras and art direction was a total disaster. The camera angels and the speed of the cuts would have fit a high-tech 21 Century action story, but not a 12th Century movie with heavy swords and tired horses and of course exhausted men.2. Whereas the costumes were fantastic the music was constantly reminding me that this was just a movie. What a contrast to the fantastic costumes, and fabulous locations/ decors. In a historical action movie these two factors are enough for me to call the movie a big disappointment.",Robin Hood

I didn't have high expectations, but i was expecting to enjoy the movie.Instead i wished i'd stayed at home with a good book.If you know the story of Robin Hood, and you're looking for a modern version then you'll be sorely disappointed. Scott has *completely* gutted the original story and instead served up a weak, flat, disappointing 'reimagining'.If, however, you have no idea about Robin Hood, then this movie will probably pass as a 5/10 action movie.Russel Crowe prances around the movie, never smiling, with the same voice and acting style (if you can call it that) that he used in Gladiator. all that was missing was 'Truth and honor', which i expected him to utter every time he open his mouth.All in all a very, very, poor film.",Robin Hood

John Cleese surely could write more historically (and hysterically) accurate and poetic lines.Russell Crowe seems to fat, too old, and too uninteresting to present a romantic or convincing Robin Hook to the screen. He tries to pull it off like an athletic shot-putter in what should be a ballet. Robin Hood should not be played like a gladiator. Gee, Sly Stallone could do same ( just as bad a job) as Crowe did for 10% of Russell's pay!The producers should have signed someone 20 years younger. I like Cate Blanchett, but she was wrong for the part of Marian.The only actor that almost pulled this downing movie's head above water was William Hurt. He needed more lines and a more developed part.

I can't tell what's the worse, the poor acting (I didn't know Mark Strong but he is the only one acting in the film)or the historical background. I won't come back to the Saving Private Ryan reference at the end but all the historical elements are completely wrong.In many versions of Robin Hood, Robin is fighting the evil Prince John while the good Richard Lionheart has been put in jail. Here Lionheart dies after 10 minutes killed by a random bloke and Robin gives the crown to John who becomes King right in front of Robin. Godfrey's betrayal leads to a French invasion and John (who is really poorly played) begs the guys he has been taking money from to help him. Robin who is around once again accepts only if John signs Magna Carta which was written (wait for it) by Robin's father !!!!!!!!! I could go on like that for hours but it's not worth my time.I think you should really watch this film to see how bad it is but don't pay for it watch it on TV one day, possibly with a couple of friends in order to laugh.",Robin Hood

The whole movie is full of crap, which shows us how men in tights originated (which I find absurd). Robin hood was just a thief , a legendary thief. They could have made tyranny of the king as the theme rather than invasion of France. How can common man become commander of archers in the later part of the movie when the king even does not know him.At the end of movie the king convicts robin hood as an outlaw, I don't know why ...cuz robin hood helped king to win the war.There are a lot of flaws in the movie.This movie could have been made like the gladiator, but fails completely due to poor plot, script and screenplay. The movie fails to attach the characters with the audience. I am pretty sure even if robin hood had died at the start of movie it would have made very little difference to the plot.To sum up they just wanted to make prequel of Robin Hood .... so here it is .Definitely not worth watching....(2/10)",Robin Hood

It was amazing how every soldier was at least in his mid-30s to make Mel Gibson look like he fit in with the rest of the cast.That being said, the movie was quite dull and uninteresting. I spend the second half texting on my phone, would have left the theater if I wasn't there with a friend.The entire movie takes place before Robin Hood becomes an outlaw, not after.

442,eugene_pustoshkin,Terrible movie attempting to earn money,3,18 May 2010,"I like Ridley Scott's movies. But in this case, I think, what might have gone wrong was the financial crisis that pressured Ridley Scott to oversimplify complex structure of the movie's narrative and make it a Frankensteinian monster that falls apart in the sake of business. Other reviews emphasized different aspects of why this movie is almost a disaster for any one who loves good-quality blockbuster cinema. Here's my take that is complementary to other mainly negative reviews.In my opinion, the Robin Hood movie started at a very good pace. First half of the movie went into a solid direction. Then the second half of it ruined it all, with the last 15 minutes making it look more like an ad flier for a forest life rather than a realistic and thorough historic work of fiction. It is that dissonance between the strict realism of the war scenes in the first part of the movie (or even the first one-third of it) and the pure madness of the concluding war scene and the last 15 minutes (with unreasonable ""plot"" and crazy dialogues in between those two) that makes me think that Ridley Scott probably wanted to make a very realistic movie but then the business issues intruded and ruined everything.I see the last part of the movie as an incoherent attempt to play on the romantic values of the primary (and the largest) target audience for the film (who sincerely think that peace and lost Eden is something that is reached through talking, naive love, friendship, and life in the forest). This idealistic homage to the naive views of this target audience departs from the promising beginning in which Ridley Scott tried to realistically portray cruel medieval life where people had to sleep on the floor, had bad teeth and disgusting odor and were ready to kill each other for money (which is in the human nature, isn't it?). I believe that the necessity for film makers to earn money doesn't contradict profound artist's creativity and that a better solution to the problem of movie making can be found that takes into account both the depth of the idea for the work of art and the span of the financial/materialistic factors (as many cult directors such as Scorcese, Wachowski, Tarantino, and others proved).Ridley, you can do it better!",Robin Hood
443,M_R_G,"Dreadful, truly dreadful.",1,2 September 2010,"There is a South Park episode where an Alien asks the boys what form he should take to be more pleasing. Inevitably, the boys get him to transform into a giant taco that sh*ts ice-cream. Throughout the entire 2 hours and 30 odd minutes of this Robin Hood movie, I was willing such a transformation on the script... not for the movie to turn into a Giant ice-cream excreting taco (although that would have been an improvement) but into a proper Robin Hood movie. Errol Flynn did it way back in 1938, Kevin Costner did it reasonably well, and even Mel Brooks managed to get a cast of B & C movie stars to pull off a half decent comedy version... So why not Ridley Scott with a truck full of money and a cast of A-listers? It simply beggars belief how badly this movie fails at being a Robin Hood movie... It blows so hard, that if it were to transform into anything, it would be a giant French horn with extra blowy bits attached.One could be forgiven for thinking a 2½ hour movie should, by definition, be a bit slow in getting started, but this movie managed to turn slow-starting into a laborious uphill struggle that dragged-on to the end credits. When I say that nothing of note happens in this movie, I don't just mean it as a flippant exaggeration to make a point; I really mean, nothing happens. Rideley Scott must surely have been paid up front by the producers, because the movie simply drifts from one dull scene to the next without much direction and little in the way of interest or entertainment to fill the scenes.Much has been made of the epic failure of Crowe's accent, with him even accusing critics of having dead ears. Well, I'm here to tell you (as someone from the North of England) that his accent truly is awful. It drifts from Manc to a hint of Scouse, sometimes wondering into Irish or even back to his native Kiwi, but rarely hitting the proper South Yorkshire or Nottinghamshire sound. As off-putting as this dire attempt at the local accent was (and it truly was off-putting) one is left wondering why he even bothered when the head of the Sherwood Forest feral kids, someone supposedly born and raised in Nottinghamshire, spoke with a broad Northern Irish accent. Crowe didn't spurt away his credibility in Gladiator by trying to fake a Latin Accent, so I'm wondering what sort of brain wave inspired this effort.The movie attempts a climax of sorts with World War II landing craft (replete with flat bottoms and front opening ramps) and a hail of arrows rather than machine guns. The only thing missing was Tom Hanks, Vin Diesel and a load of medieval gliders and flame throwers. In summation: Dire.",Robin Hood

446,lizafaro,disapointing,4,8 April 2018,"With a high class cast, a good director this movie is entertaining until two-third of its running time. Until the last part the movie is entertaining enough, then plunges in a lot of fighting scenes, I could no longer endure, and I left the movie, disapointed. why nowadays there is so much explicit violence included into the stories told ?
Is it because it reflects our times ? But why audiences like to see so much blood and gore as they can see that on our daily news ? A mystery to me. Where are the simple, well told stories, about human condition like for instance Cria Cuervos? why movies are nowadays so full of special effects, are moviemakers nowadays afraid of pure storytelling and for the big money they add so much unnecessary violence ? Gladiotor contained some grafic violence, but it added to the storytelling and not as a means to simply show blood and gore.
Perhaps the reason that more and more people like to watch animated stories, who sometimes still has a story to tell. (Spirited away, When Marnie was there, The red Turtle). I would wish the European Cinema would become more in focus, many films made in Europe still tells interesting stories , not filled with continious battles, swordswaying etc.
I really miss storytelling in present movies, especially from Hollywood. I like to see less sequals only made to exploit earlier boxoffice succes, and more original stories. (how many times story of Robin Hood already has been told?

447,serennishiyama,Under-Rated Gem! Cleverly written and cleverly wrought.,10,19 September 2010,"First off, to address those so-called ""critics"" who take issue with Ridley Scott for taking literary license with history, what else could he do when dealing with a FICTIONAL CHARACTER? I mean really! Robin Hood is fanciful mythology that is set in a real, historical context. ANY interaction the character has with any historical figure or event is going to be taking liberties with real history. So complaints of the Magna Carta being alluded to or specific battles, places, or interactions with persons can be nothing BUT literary license which any sensible and fair person must excuse when watching a film about a fictional character. Films require the willing suspension of disbelief from intelligent audience members. Viewers incapable of that should never watch fiction, and stick only to documentaries. That said, Ridley Scott does an excellent job weaving the fiction which is Robin Hood into real situations, and this origin story sets the stage politically and on a personal level the events to come in any sequels (One hopes)that will result. None of the other films or portrayals has even bothered to do so. Robin Hood shows an attention to detail on the matters of medieval life, even so far as to show the hardships that even Nobles had to face. To that end, Marion Loxley's character is shown as a great example of noble womanhood. Robin and Marion's romance is slow in blossoming and therefore much more believable than the typical Hollywood drivel that passes for romance. Finally, the true gems that shine in this film are the Merry Men, wonderfully played by Scott Grimes, Kevin Durand, and newcomer to film Alan Doyle. Each brings life and vibrant believability to their characters. And on a personal note, Alan Doyle was a wonderful choice as Alan A'Dayle. Ridley Scott and Russell Crowe could not have made a better choice. I highly recommend this film.",Robin Hood

For $200 million they should have hired a better period person, the Higgens boats design, to obvious,also I agree the Merry Men roles could have been developed better and Crowe himself could have put more of himself into the role. The directors cut definitely filled out the picture better and was not to long for me, cleared up some confusions. Over all the movies plot, Richards death and the subsequent story was a interesting and different one from the old same old same old, refreshing, and the subsequent story line was believable in a way as much as the fable of Robin Hood is really known, however, with a little more effort and some better writing and plot interest which would not have cost any more , I believe the film could have been much better. I would look forward to a sequel but don't expect one unless they could cut down on the costs, possible if they did less large battle scenes , and made up for it with better story line and writing. It doesn't look like it was a commercial success vs the actual cost of the film unless foreign and DVD sales make up the difference.",Robin Hood

As far the acting, you have solid actors in the name of Russell crow and Cate. Both of them stuck to their reputation of great actors.The war sequences are not up-to the mark of standard set by gladiator.

450,j_coache,A Massive Disappointment for what held so much potential,2,23 May 2010,"Being a big fan of both Russell Crowe and Ridley Scott, I can safely say they should both be hanging their heads in shame for this dire, boring and utterly pathetic attempt at recreating what should have been another epic film.That maybe sounds a bit harsh, but Ridley Scott did set the bar pretty high for himself with Gladiator and so teaming up once again with Crowe had me and I'm sure many other movie lovers drooling at the prospect of seeing something equally as exiting and brilliant, and how very let down I was.Don't get me wrong here, the movie is shot very professionally and very much in the gladiatoresque way that Scott is renowned for, there is little wrong with how this movie looks. It is also a prequel for the Robin Hood story we all know but in making such a movie the director should have the imagination and creativity to create something brilliant as realistically there is nothing stopping him from making the story up as he goes along, giving a pioneering director like Scott all the freedom to come up with something outstanding. It seems that making it up as he went along is very much what happened here, only Ridley seems to have only managed to have the ideas for two types of scenes for the first two hours of this movie, battles and drunken celebrations as other than 5 minutes or so of plot development aside, thats all there is. The characters are not likable or believable, in fact perhaps the only believable character in this story is the French Villain, who in true French fashion tries to flee from every battle when the going gets tough. My main gripe with this movie is simply that its just not good enough coming from a director of Ridley Scott's calibre. Perhaps the familiarity of seeing Russell Crowe as the warmongering hero killing everyone in his path in dramatically shot battle scenes is just all too familiar, but really its not that which disappoints in this film. It is simply the poor execution of character building and lack of ideas in the storyline that make the build up to what should be exciting action scenes somewhat underwhelming. A case of what might have been and a forgettable effort as opposed to what I'd hoped would be another classic from a great director.",Robin Hood

A huge war scene and we don't know who robin hood is fighting or why. all we know is they are fighting and Scott is apparently sticking to a PG rating cause all the action is close up, cant really tell what is going on and they cut away from everything. POintless and stupid. then there are some kids stealing seeds and one of them is in a deerskin mask, they never really tell who these kids are. Then we meet Little John, who i deeply enjoyed watching even though h maybe has a total of 10 minutes screen time. other than that the rest of the movie is a waste, a desert dry middle and yet another long and pointless war scene in the end. The last 5 minutes are really great, too bad you have to sit through 2 hrs and 25 minutes to get to it. overall this movie is pointless, long, and not well put together.

I do feel that is the best Robin Hood film that they have ever done.Ridley Scott, who was coming off the disastrous Body of Lies, has returned to form with this film. He drives the story with great ease and no ruff spots or parts that seem to drag and be boring. I was pleasantly surprised that this film wasn't Gladiator 2 like everybody thought it was going to be. It was interesting to see the removal of all the b.s. that has hindered Robin Hood films of the past. The score, cinematography, and art direction are fantastic as usual in a Ridley Scott film. Russell Crowe was very good at playing a role that has seen the likes of Errol Flynn, Sean Connery, and Kevin Costner. He continues to prove his great ear for accents. Cate Blanchett gives a solid performance as Maid Marion. Mark Strong, Oscar Issac, and William Hurt are all very good.Then we come to the real scene stealer and truly the most memorable performance of the film. Max von Sydow truly was perfect in this film. Giving a great and masterful performance and making Oscar winners like Cate Blanchett and Russell Crowe look like high school actors.

456,cjwillemse,Solid but a bit stupid,5,14 May 2010,"Robin Hood is a very professionally made film. Great actors, great production design, great images. It is nice to watch because you feel you are in the capable hands of Ridley Scott. But do not expect to be amazed by the story or the acting. Apart from dame Marion, the characters are two dimensional and predictable. The film pretends to be historically correct, but is of course a well dressed fantasy. There are a few battle scenes, filmed in the Gladiator way. They are exciting, but not very convincing. In fact, they are completely ridiculous when you think you are watching a historically correct film. The worst for me were the boats in the final battle, apparently trying to induce a D-Day feeling. Overall, the story is off balance. Some scenes have a very slow pace, while other scenes, often key elements that explain how Robin Hood came into existence, are reduced to a few shots and proclamations. The end of the film tells it all: it reminds us that we were supposed to see the story of how the legend of Robin Hood started. The makers just forgot to tell it.",Robin Hood
457,cecodere,"Bad bad, inaccurate movie...",4,19 May 2010,"This movie is not about Robin Hood at all, and it contains all typical Hollywood movie criteria that make it a bad movie: A simple soldier, who by chance becomes a hero, who saves a knight who's father knew the hero's father that created the first draft of the Magna Carta (what a coincidence!), a hero that is more adored by soldiers than the king himself, a hero who thinks that everyone is made equal, and that there is no difference between a knight and a squire (nobody thought like that at that time), a heroin who, has never fought a battle before, who, all of a sudden, is able to take a 30 lbs sword and kill enemy soldiers, a final battle where the heroin is almost slain and where the battle surrounding her and the hero suddenly stops, some folk of the village dancing on the tune of a music which has a decidedly pop music theme!... No this is definitely a bad movie, no historical accuracy, at best a fun movie to rent when it is raining outside and nothing better is out on DVD, otherwise stay away from it!! The acting was good though, within the limits of this bad plot.",Robin Hood
458,gbeneker,A definite must see!,10,12 May 2010,Won pre-screening tickets to see this in downtown San Francisco.Me and my girlfriend were so excited to see this and it did not let us down one bit.Russel's acting was excellent-as expected- and the rest of the actors did a great job. The plot was well thought out and actually surprised us with some nice twists and turns.The chirography for the action scenes were perfectly shot and just downright epic for the most part. The score of the movie was well placed and well paced. Definitely led up to the action sequences and died down where it needed to.10/10 GO SEE IT! :D,Robin Hood
459,ibalog,Bad but not tiresome,4,30 December 2010,"This movie is bad, but I do not regret watching it because it is not tiresome at any point. It starts off great, with interesting plot development and good action scenes. The creators had an interesting idea of how to ""put a new spin"" on the story of Robin Hood.As the story progresses some plot points are introduced trough a back door, which turn out to be relevant towards the end of the movie. In my opinion the entire story changes its flavor in this way. Robin is forced into a role of deliverer of the entire nation, something like William Wallace in the movie ""Braveheart"". But this only seems slightly out of place and the movie does well until the last half an hour.The way in which the movie culminates is terrible in my opinion. The movie is transformed into a sort of an unintentional comedy. The makers of the film, completely awkwardly and obviously mix motives from different films. The way in which this was done can only be regarded as a comedy relief! Everything culminates in a final showdown and a big battle, because nothing less could sell probably. Needles to say that Robin plays the central role and everybody else bows to his might. Only so that the storyline twists once again at the very end, bringing us to ""how Robin Hood came to be"".To sum up: movie starts very good as an action pass-time but as it progresses, the story is totally forced and even comical. As if the creators had an idea of how to start the movie, but not how to finish it.",Robin Hood
460,iantc39,Best Robin Hood? Not by far......,5,9 June 2010,"Don't get me wrong I love Russel Crowe, and Ridley Scott is a great director. Gladiator was a truly great movie that I enjoy every time I watch it. I found that same chemistry not very pleasant with Robin Hood. I remember watching the old Robin Hood with Errol Flynn with my father when I was young and pretty much understood what was going on even at my early age. My 12 year old son had no idea what was happening in this new film, only liking the bloody battle sequences. I missed the humor and almost a little tongue in cheek of the original story as I think it should have been. Russel Crowe, while a great actor, was way too old for this part and has the personality of a brick in this movie. Cate Blanchette who plays Marian is WAY too old! Maid Marian was supposed to be a young beauty. Not that I'm saying Cate Blanchette isn't beautiful, but shes 41! come on! The story was slow and the aspects many of us remember from the stories were just replaced with this new alternate version. I like seeing Robin and Little John meet with the staff fight sequence. That is part of the classic tale and goes a long way to make the characters seem vulnerable and light hearted even in a dramatic setting. I thought the movie was all together little too dark and a little too epic. Was there ever a Sunny day in Nottingham? Anyways I did find the movie interesting and is definitely worth a watch, but I think they missed the bullseye with this one, no pun intended.",Robin Hood

464,ct021976-986-657692,The idiotic adventures of grumpy Robin Hood (who hates the French),1,25 February 2011,"Well  this movie force me to register at IMDb because the scoring in 24-02-2011 was 6.9 in popularity. Such scoring is unfair, to say the least This movie is a 3.5 highest. Sorry for the cast, crew and other people involved in making it, but I must be honest. This movie was written probably on c*caine ore something similar because is just insane, OK you want a new legend so you invent one, but this is beyond inventing a new story, is totally and utterly rubbish, and is unbelievable in every way. After the starting (which is normal) the movie jumps from pseudo historic into the SF genre and stays there in a weird way. And is NOT a proper SF either (I mean the Aliens are not the Merry Men from the Wood, but close!) The cast does not shine at all, the special effects are misplaced or off context, the story is boring and idiotic at the same time and I can continue It is obvious now that LA Confidential was an exception and in fact Brian Helgeland can not write a proper screenplay. I am quite amazed by Ridley Scott,because THIS is a FLOP and not a blockbuster. So 1 out of 10 to lower that high score",Robin Hood
465,clarkpark24,Watch it again,10,5 August 2012,"I watched Ridley Scott's 2010 version of Robin Hood about a month ago, and thought ""Not bad – a 7 or an 8 – but certainly no match for the 1938 Errol Flynn / Olivia Dehaviland epic."" It was definitely better than Prince of Thieves, and I was trying to decide if it was as good as the Patrick Bergen / Uma Thurman British TV movie.But some parts of it stuck in my mind, so I watched it again a week later. It was better than I remembered. I just watched it for the fourth time. It's not only the best Robin Hood ever made, it may be the best movie.Current historians believe that, if there was a real person who's the basis for the Robin Hood legend, he was likely a yeoman and not a dispossessed feudal lord. This version makes Robin Longstride a yeoman archer, posing as Robert Locksley, a landed knight.It also presents Richard the Lionheart with more historically accuracy – as a glory seeking perpetual warrior who bled England dry to finance his wars and crusades. Yet still not completely accurate: this Richard speaks English and is on his way home to England when he dies; the real Richard ruled from Aquitaine and spoke only French. It shows John Lackland more as he was as well: the needy youngest son, grasping, but utterly inept.Also for the first time, the story includes the defining event of its century, a document whose goals it alludes to without ever mentioning: the Magna Carta.This isn't the Robin Hood story you grew up with. All the main characters are there, but they meet and become attached in more realistic and intricate ways. Which is as it should be, since this isn't the legend, it's the prequel.Helgeland & Co's story and script are brilliant, and Ridley Scott's direction is, as usual, beyond excellent. Russell Crowe and Cate Blanchett are real and compelling as Robin and Marian, and the supporting cast, particularly William Hurt and Max von Sydow, is first rate.Another nice touch is folk-rocker Alan Doyle as Alan A'Dale, hugging the mandolin to his chest while crooning delicate ballads, and bouncing with it at his waist while shouting bawdy ballads – Robin Hood's minstrel as the 13th century Bob Seger.I can't recommend this movie highly enough. While more accurate than its predecessors, it isn't the history that's true, but the history we wish was true.",Robin Hood

I have watched so many movies, even Gladiator had an oomph factor.. but at the end of Robinhood ..... I CLAPPED... It is such an inspiring movie.

467,floyd-russel,Solid effort all-around,8,31 March 2012,"Although my favorite Robin will always be Errol Flynn, this modern version of ""Robin Hood"" starring Russell Crowe as the infamous thief who stole from the rich, and gave to the poor is quite good. Much better than Kevin Costner's, I grant you that.Robin has just come back to England after fighting in King Richard's war against the French. He journeys to Nottingham, and poses as the husband of Lady Marion (Played by Cate Blanchett), so that she may keep the property of her real husband who died in the war, part of a favor to her husband's father (Played by Max Von Sydow). Meanwhile, the newly appointed King John (Played by Oscar Isaac) is greedily taxing the land of all of it's funds, unaware that one of his closest subjects, Sir Godfrey (Played by Mark Strong) is secretly collaborating with the French on a massive invasion.So, this shot, kind of missed the target. But you know what, even though it was off center from hitting the bullseye, as an action/adventure film, it's not bad.This is all intended to be a prequel, and set up to the Robin Hood legend that WE all know. The gleeful prince of thieves ranging from The Adventures of Robin Hood from 1938, all the way into animation, such as Disney's animated retelling of the story. Well, that was the past. Even though they still retain some of it, Robin and his band of Merry Men have been deprived of some of the personality traits normally associated with them. But I can't really blame Ridley Scott for wanting to present this kind of version of Robin Hood, in fact I do applaud him a bit for it.Performances were fine. Russell Crowe and Cate Blanchett, both incredibly talented actors, are good in their roles as Robin Hood and Lady Marion respectively. But, I don't know, they didn't show much chemistry. Oscar Isaac is a real attention grabber, not really in a good way though, it just seems like he tries way too hard. William Hurt, and Max Von Sydow, great. Robin's Merry men, are kind of average to good (Special mention to Mark Addy). And now to finish off performances... WHAT THE HELL is with Mark Strong getting typecast as villains (not to mention getting cast in number 963 on the list of villains who are bald and/or scarred)? Can't he play a nice guy for a change, or something like Body of Lies? Looks evil, but isn't all that evil. Still, I can't deny that he does a good job at it.All in all, a great movie, and I recommend you see it if you haven't already.",Robin Hood
468,monzy-656-616812,A great prequel to the Robin Hood story,9,14 August 2021,"I really enjoyed this a great prequel to the Robin Hood Story.So many have commented on Crowes voice, but really does it matter? Sorry to let others know but it is just a story and there is no truth to it. No one complains about Sean Connery sounding Scottish in every movie he has acted in. Directors shouldn't even ask actors with strong accents to try to sound like anything but themselves. Braveheart was a huge hit, Gibsons' accent was really iffy and I am allowed to say that as I am Scottish, despite his accent and the artistic licence liberties, Braveheart was a hit with us Scots and we enjoyed Gibsons' portrayal of Wallace despite his accent and him being Australian. So I feel that people are being unfair to Crowe. Judging the movie as bad because of this is nonsense. It was all filmed in England and shows some of England's beautiful scenery.All the actors did a great job and Blanchett and Crowe work well together. I really enjoyed this movie and feel it is a shame that they did not go ahead with the sequel, as I definitely would have watched it. I feel people were too quick to judge and possibly compared it to Gladiator. (Please remember it is Russell Crowe with short hair so he is going to look like Maximus, it is a shame he cut his hair short at the last minute for this movie as maybe many would not have been as judgemental about Crowe). Let's be honest no film compares to Gladiator, it is one of those great movies that will live on for ever.If you haven't watched Robin Hood, give it a chance and go into it without judgement.

469,maxinbxl,"Good film, let down by 'Merrye England' inclusion",7,31 March 2014,"First off, I liked the film, and it came in above the expectations I had after reading the reviews - though below that I had initially hoped for from the Ridley Scott/Russell Crowe combination of fictionalised historical action (aka Gladiator).As Robin Hood, Russell Crowe was good when being an ordinary man, aside from an accent that veered wildly between regions, but was unconvincing when in declamatory mode. This is especially compared with his superb performances of this kind in Gladiator and Master and Commander. His men at arms/henchmen are fine as lightweight support in humorous or action roles, though lack substance in anything other than a 'yes Robin' act. Excellent performance by Cate Blanchett and in supporting roles William Hurt (as Marshall), Max von Sydow (Loxley) and (especially) Eileen Atkins (Eleanor of Acquitaine). Matthew MacFadyen works well as Sheriff of Nottingham, although condemned to a rather effete and un-menacing persona by the script, as does Mark Strong as a textbook villain.The film was let down by irritating and completely unnecessary 'humour' - one dreadful but mercifully brief pun ('a good knight'), a spot of innuendo, and the ridiculously implemented waggon-jacking. Some mawkishness should also have been ditched - leave Feed the Children to UNESCO, and don't have a ragamuffin band of kids on ponies charge from Nottingham to the south coast for romantic effect.The beach landing let down a reputation for passable reality for action scenes; wrong craft, utterly inappropriate beach (though suspiciously convenient for an ambush).",Robin Hood
470,KieranCoughlan,Awful Mess,3,14 June 2010,"No doubt there are some people who will manage to squeeze some enjoyment of of this leaden, confused and boring mess of a film, but I'm not one of them.The film starts very slowly and is a little dull, but apart from the many dreadful accents, not all awful. It is after Robin reaches Nottingham that the story becomes increasingly ridiculous. Anyone with an ounce of knowledge of English history should avoid this film like the plague, because it will probably drive you crazy.Many people have pointed out the anachronisms and plot holes but there is one that I haven't seen mentioned: in the climatic battle scene, Marion spots her father's killer and goes to seek her revenge. I'd love someone to tell me how she recognized him, since she's in the village when her father's killed and barely sees the back of his killer when he rides past on horseback. Perhaps Mark Strong was the only bald actor in the production? Would be nice to find a few positives here; the film is well shot and I enjoyed Mark Strong's and Oscar Isaac's performances, they both give good villain, although the Kind John character was confused at best.I really enjoyed Gladiator, but it was probably the worst thing to ever happen to Ridely Scott. Kingdom of Heaven was another clunker. I sincerely hope the clearly signposted sequels to this film never get made.",Robin Hood

In the middle I was about to give it a score of 8 or even 9, However the second part in my opinion was quite disappointing due to some terrible war tactics used in the movie. What were those explosives in the beginning of the movie, when the brits used catapults? Why, the hell, the French would make a descent at such a rocky beach and would allow them to be shot to dead by the British archers? Why would they make their way from France in so many little boats, very similar to the Normandy attack in the Second World War? How is that after Philippe gives the retreat order the boats immediately turned around... There were plenty of details that did not match. Final score: 7",Robin Hood

473,oephyx,"Solid, but not great",7,12 May 2010,"Solid is the keyword. From the screenplay, to the cinematography and the performance, the film is based on solid grounding. Indeed, we couldn't imagine less from the people assembled on the project. And the first signs are indeed good, starting as an origin story that traces Robin's steps returning from the Crusades and arriving in Nottingham. The plot is immediately both compelling and fresh with regards to the well known tale.The first problem we run into is that the film never allows itself to linger. This creates two problems: the sense of purpose it reaches for through urgency has a tendency to be lost to aimlessness, and the characters never have the space to generate real depth of emotion.Imagine only this: Russel Crowe, Cate Blanchett and William Hurt together have collected three Oscars, and an additional nine nominations. Yet it it's hard to lavish praise on their performances, because they never manage to inspire empathy as well as we might wish. The sense of urgency - of imminent physical danger to their person, of the crucial importance of their quest - never quite strikes home.The screenplay doesn't always help them. It attempts to give the tale a strong moral foundation, by associating it with burgeoning democratic ideals in feudal Britain, unconvincingly: suspension of disbelief failed this reviewer.For both these reasons, the epic sense of greatness that saturates Mr. Scott's similar works never works in this one. Indeed, in the anticipated climax of the battle, slow motion shots fall flat, and emotion never reaches an expected high, in spite of the film's competence in the action scenes.This is a work that strangely echoes others, as well. People will be drawn to comparisons with Gladiator; these aren't particularly relevant beyond Russell Crow's similar (yet less engaging) performance. Rather, Robin's journey from the crusades and through England, in which he prospers on fateful luck and earned respect, copies Ridley Scott's own Kingdom of Heaven. In their themes and ambition these three films are alike, but Robin Hood doesn't thrive from the comparison. Where flaws are shared, what made the other two great is oddly lacking in this latest historical epic from the director.",Robin Hood

Sure-almost every movie has at least a few, get used to it-but that doesn't mean the film is bad at all.

481,Fledrinnian,"It's a good thing there were a lot of left overs weapons, costumes and props from ""Kingdom of Heaven""",4,14 May 2010,"I saw it today and I have to say that I am somewhat disappointed.First, I have to say that Crowe and Blanchett are too old to be portraying characters at a ""young"" stage of their lives. This tale is intended to be a ""prequel"" to all the regular stories of Robin Hood, and Crowe's face is now far too creased to be believable as a young man.With this sort of semi-historical movie, you have to be willing to suspend reality in the distortions of history. For example, while ""Braveheart"" was a fantastic film in all respects, the liberties taken with historical accuracy are legion. This film takes liberties as well (it has must since Robin Hood is considered fiction), but it lacks the quality and luster of is predecessors. The plot seems vague and disconnected, and is clouded by too many characters. While the story line is the common good vs. evil, the portrayed loyalties of the players left me rather apathetic.The actions sequences are typical Ridley Scott, but after so many of his films, the quick-action, close-up shots are growing tiresome. It has reached the point were the quick-cut photography now makes it too hard to determine exactly what is happening on the battlefield. While I am a fan of Crowe, this was, by far, not his best performance. Blanchett is lovely and handles her strong character well, but as a women who is willing to wear armor and fight in battle, it is far too trite for Crowe to have to rescue her at the end. I groaned when she had to recite the line ""Walter, this one's for you"". I think the writers could have done far better. Von Sydow is a joy to watch as his performance is the best in the film. Friar Tuck is obviously intended to be comedy relief, but this falls flat. Robin's battle companions seem present only to give tie-ins to the common Robin Hood tales. They remain on the fringes of the film, are uninteresting, and it is difficult to care much about them.The weapons are clearly ""Kingdom of Heaven"" leftovers. The shields are so poorly repainted that you can see large areas of chipping around he edges.By far, biggest disappointment with the movie was the appearance of the invading French soldiers in wooden ""LSTs"". In the year 1199 troop transports were seldom more than commandeered trade ships. No Navy in the history of the world ever built such a thing out of lumber. My suspension of reality reached breaking point, and I was no longer buying in to the story. What were the writers thinking??I can not fault the actors in this film. I think they did the best with what was given to them. The major problem here was the screenplay. A mediocre storyline coupled with forgettable characters makes this movie fall far short of its potential. In the end I found it hard to believe that anyone involved with the film really cared about it. Scott has repeatedly proved himself capable of much better.",Robin Hood

I still cannot believe how awesome this movie was. The scenery and cinematography was jaw droppingly gorgeous. It was so realistically filmed....you really felt like you were there in the 12th century. The cast was great and the acting superb. Russell Crowe is my new favorite Robin Hood and his chemistry with Cate Blanchett was natural and did not seem forced whatsoever. Mark Strong as the villain was wonderful as always. (I really don't think that he has been in a movie that I haven't enjoyed or loved him in) I have to commend the director on the action sequences. One of my main disappointments of newer movies is the action. Much of the time nowadays these sections of the movie are overdone, confusing, and overwhelming. Robin Hood, thankfully, did not fall in this category. All of the action sequences were extremely well shot. They were exciting and fast-paced without being overwhelming, and were not overloaded with blood and gore. The beach scene at the end between the English and French soldiers was one of the best battle scenes I've seen. The only objections I have, which are very few in number, is the back story of Robin's past and the screen time of his ""merry men"". The story surrounding Robin's father's death was a little confusing and didn't do much for the overall story. In regards to his merry men, I would have loved for them to have more screen time. They were the source of many of the humorous moments in the movie and I loved seeing them on screen. In short, GO SEE THIS MOVIE!!!!! It is a well-made historical action thriller, with a charming love story. Definitely a worthwhile film experience...and most definitely worth owning.",Robin Hood
483,nuordr34,One of the worst takes on Robin Hood yet!,3,1 September 2010,"Ridley Scott has been known for delivering action packed movies, however, Robin Hood is not one of them. Robin Hood has always been about how a villain/hero giving to the wealthy and in this movie you saw glimpses of that, but not the true Robin Hood until the last three minutes of the movie. Russell Crowe played a great part as Robin Hood even though his character never really took off. While Cate Blanchett tried to play a good Marion Loxley, she just never truly seemed like a Marion to me. She is a great actress that happened to play the wrong part. The Sheriff of Nottingham was a coward in this film, he never truly played the part he is known for, a villain with a badge. Furthermore, the parts of Little John, Will Scarlet, Allan A'Dayle, and Friar Tuck seemed small compared to Robin Hood movies of the past. Finally, if you are wanting to see a true Robin Hood movie/TV show, then check out the television series that the BBC created. It was a wonderful series and a great take on what a true Robin Hood film is all about.",Robin Hood

I thought ""Wind"" was bad. And, it's not like I can't enjoy a bad movie. 2012 was a movie about the world coming to an end. It was horrible, but extremely entertaining. THIS version of ""Robin Hood"" had me wishing the world would end so I wouldn't have to finish it. It was like slow death.I've never seen a version of Robin Hood I haven't liked....until now. Even Kevin Costner's lackluster performance was surrounded by fine performances from his supporting cast and a decent story.No story. No character development. No hook. No suspense.

The movie tells us the different story of robin hood,the script is wonderful, all the actors did a great job. the Cinematography was unique, and the director took us to a robin hood world by his good job. there is a lot of scenes that I cant forget, and I liked robin hood relationship with the lady marione,I didn't like one thing about the movie, that it didn't focus on robin friends, I think they desserve a movie talking about them!

I mean.. this Hood is OK, no doubt, but it could well have been filmed in the 90s..nothing new.. symphonic ost, clothing consistent with the historical period, faces with the correct characters.. it all too obvious...perhaps a new vision, like... Zack Snyder, Paul Thomas Anderson, could give new life to this character.The dear Ridley, has not gone too far the possibility that the story could offer.Russel, not bad, but maybe under the slightly rhetoric Scott's direction, failed to achieve the top.",Robin Hood
487,si-baker,disappointing,4,13 May 2010,"Upon entering this cinema to see this film I was full of excitement, a classic story I was told as a child and seen on the screen, first in the form of a fox and then in the form of a youngish Kevin Coaster. I was expecting a new, exciting twist on this man, this legends life..... boy was I wrong.The film is centred around Richard 'The Lion Hearts' crusades and Frances desire to invade and conquer England after his death. Strangely, this IS the main story line which no real purpose or need for Robin himself who just blends in. Whilst this is not the greatest problem, the great detail and vast array of characters and sub-plots the story needs to be told becomes one. A new story requires screen time, further pushing Robin away from the centre of this picture. New characters, the key change being Sir Godfrey who replaces the Sheriff of Nottingham as the main villain. This further pushes the story away from the classic tale we love. The Sheriff does feature in the film for a total of 4 scenes, each lasting a minuet long. After watching them your just simply baffled as to why he was included at all. The same goes for all the old classic characters such as little John and Friar Tuck who are merely background noise and token gestures. Annoyingly the film focuses a lot of Robin Hoods screen time on the relationship between Marion and Robin. There are long winded scenes of them merely talking or dancing or comically flirting which warrants a smirk whilst inevitably thinking'Please let something happen SOON'. But nothing, I cant think of a moment where I believed Robin or anyone else was actually in some danger, they where just untouchable throughout. Excluding a small attack on Nottingham where the conclusion was obvious and boringly played out.The film continues to plod along with pockets of action and deceit from other story lines finally ending with a mediocre battle and a 'set up' for another film along the more classic story. I felt myself thinking at the end of the film 'That's what I want to see a spin on the classic story, I wanted to see the film you haven't even made yet!!'So basically this film is nothing more than a long winded introduction that could have been summed up in about 30mins. Yes you do find out the 'real' history about Robin Hood, yes you do begin to understand more about the state of English society in the 12th Century, yes you do begin to understand why robin hood did what he did... is this entertaining? ........no.",Robin Hood
488,christophestammet,"Entertaining pre-legend, but fell short of being an epic",7,13 May 2010,"The new film by Ridley Scott had already much to carry on his shoulders before its release: ""Gladiator Version 2.0"",""Maximus in tights"", etc. On the other side, expectations were also quite high, as it was a new film of the director who gave us many classics, many brilliant films.Let's start with the script: It is convincingly packing the pre-legend of the all-known outlaw into a 140 minutes long film with enough time for its characters ( only the Sheriff of Nottingham felt surprisingly unnecessary in the 3 scenes he had considering the importance he has in the original legend ). Some light and funny scenes involving Father Tuck and the three ""fellows"" of Robin save the middle part of the film from drifting into a slow, boringish story development.The actors are all pretty convincing. The main characters, Crowe and Blanchett don't give away too memorable performances, it all felt it has been there before ( yeah, I know: Maximus version 2 or the stoic acceptance of every emotional break by Lady Marion ). On the other side, the supporting cast was brilliantly chosen and every role was played with a lot of energy, lead by a brilliant Oscar Isaac as the naive, weak King John, and by a brilliant Max von Sydow, who won my heart as the most lovable character in the film. Mark Strong is again top-notch as the films main villain ( overall a very menacing guy, AND he speaks French ^^ ).The cinematography is as you'd expect from Ridley Scott. Some really breathtaking landscape shots ( Arrival of Robin in London ;) ), the action scenes are also good, although I expected a little bit more brilliance in these. Sound is very good, nice sword-clashing, horse-clapping, etc and a very memorable thing is the score. The third work between Scott and Marc Streitenfeld ( after American Gangster and Body of Lies ) is also their best one, it really captures the epicness the film was slightly missing. Streitenfeld really delivered a score that shouldn't hide before the other epic soundtrack ( although I preferred both Zimmerscores for Gladiator and King Arthur ).Overall, the film is enjoyable, entertaining but it won't be the film we remember from 2010. Some pacing problems and a pretty abrupt and short climax make the spectator wish there could've been a little more brightness in it. It can although be recommended, don't judge it to much by the trailers, which deliver an image of action battle for two hours, which it isn't.",Robin Hood
489,gavshed,Historically accurate they said :-S,1,24 May 2010,"During the Gallipoli campaign of 1915 rowing boats were used to reach the shores of Anzac beach, it was concluded that a better solution needed to be found. During the August offensive purpose built landing craft were used for the first time.You may ask why I have chosen to bring this up, in answer if ridley scot got his history right why 800 years after the French use such craft to invade England did we use rowing boats to invade Gallipoli.Unfortunately the care taken in historical research was mirrored in several other areas such as lack of plot, continuity, accent choice and ofc not to forget the king died in his mother's arms.Would like to know how I go about getting the £20 and 2 hours of my life back.",Robin Hood
490,suzanne-maeker,Don't miss it!,10,20 May 2010,"Thought it was excellent. Am not so picky about accents and Russell Crowe was a gladiator again! Went to see it with others who also thought it was a really good movie. All the characters were wonderful, especially a sad and funny Sir Walter Locksley and a feisty Maid Marian. This movie was more historically correct and did not romanticize the lives of the people of the time. This story was the same in some ways (with all the familiar characters)but very different in other ways. Thought it had just the right balance of battle and plot scenes. Liked the way it started and also the way it ended. So much better than Iron Man 2....ugh!",Robin Hood
491,J-rod31,A Brilliant Film Worth Seeing Twice,10,14 July 2010,"The new Robin Hood is a brilliantly made film with a fantastic actor and a great director. The Robin Hood we are used to seeing is no where near as cool as the one Russell Crowe plays. He shows Robin Hood as a tough, prepare for the fight, don't mess with me type of guy instead of the Kevin Costner version that shows Robin Hood as a get-in-get-out, sissy. I enjoyed the film. I will say that it is similar to Gladiator. Robin Hood is portrayed as I thought he should be. The film was much more realistic than the cartoonish versions of the past. It brings great battle scenes and great historical references from the crusades. I can't wait for the second film to come into theaters and I also can't wait for this to come out on DVD and BluRay. Ridley Scott and Russel Crowe again impress me in the film industry.",Robin Hood
492,luzian-friedrich,Great - but only the DIRECTORS CUT,9,24 March 2017,"Can 15min make such a huge difference? YES - THEY CANAfter Blade Runner, Kingdom of Heaven and now Robin Hood you can say, that you have to wait for the DC of Scott-film just to enjoy is capabilities in film-making. After seven years (!) I decided to watch Robin Hood again and for free by amazon prime. For me the movie was more entertaining then in cinema in 2010, but I just thought: ""Hmmm... Kingdom of Heaven was so great in the DC-Version - just give Robin Hood another chance.""So I watched the 15min longer DC yesterday night and I was really blown away!!! I was just watching the new scenes and by every single take i've thought: ""Why - for god's sake - took they these scenes out? NOW the story makes much much much more sense!"" It's IMHO a much more smarter story then Gladiator had - I think, the greatest benefit of Gladiator (besides acting and the visual thing) was the music. Zimmer's Score is really great and the Robin Hood Score by Streitenfeld is also good and fit's into the movie, but it's not that impressive. Therefor you will have IMHO a much more political story. It feels sometimes like a history lesson, but so unbelievable entertaining because of the Robin Hood-elements, the action and so on... Here the facts, which increases the movie for me from a solid 7/10 to a really good 9/10 (SPOILER): the children of the forest get now more screen time and you will now understand AND accept there action in the final battle - many small and gritty scenes are integrated and you will sit in Front of the screen thinking: ""aaaaahhh - now I've got it - that makes sense now..."" and so on - the relationship between Robin and Marian get's more depth and intense: it's amazing to see Blanchet and Crowe act so fine, funny and lovely, that you really think, that they are in love - great and very well done - the merry men get's also more screen time, even so Mark Strong, the french and William Hurt - the inner-political conflict and why it is focused by Godfrey will be now seen in a much more clearer way - the action sequences are now more brutal (not as explicit like in Braveheart or Gladiator, but brutal and bloody enough that you will be great entertained) - King John's hate against Robin Hood and his reaction after the won battle (where he not signed the Charata) is now much more clearer - the final battle at the beach is now much more epic and is the key scene in the movie (because now all English parties (the poor people, the King and the barones fight together (UNITED KINGDOM) against the french invasion); overall it seems to me, that the last battle is ""greater"" and much more impressive as the in the cinema version The cinema version just feels like Scott made the movie with a Robin Hood-Checklist: - Merry Men in - check - King John in - check - Maid Marian in - check - robbing rich people and give it to the poor - check - Kids + forest-something in - check - Bow and Arrow in - checkand so one... The cinema-version felt ""unfinished"". But the DC finishes the story to a funny, entertaining and fully-action medieval history lesson with great actors and great cinematography. I think you will recognize, that Scott puts his heart into this Dicretor's CutI really, really, really don't understand, why they didn't bring this version into cinemas. It takes all the great things of the 70's comic and the Costner-Version together with the historical elements of Kingdom of Heaven and the humor of The Martian (that kind of humor plays now a bigger role in the DC) and the better title would have been: ""Robin Hood Begins"". It's a very cool mix out of pieces you've seen in ""Lord of the Rings"", ""Kingdom of Heaven"", ""Gladiator"" but despite this it's kind of funny and NOW in the DC-Version it's to fast over. At the end I've hoped to see a sequel, in which Robin fights again the King and rob's much more rich people to give it to the poor.If I should compare the Robin Hood DC with any other movie according to his level of entertaining then I would say: ""If you loved ""Batman Beginns"" than you will also love ""Robin Hood"", but only the Director's Cut"" Really unbelievable, how 15min can improve a movie that much. For me it's the best Robin Hood Version I've ever seen. It's not ridiculous, it's serious in the right moments, it's not to brutal, but gritty enough. Now you will get in touch with the actors, you will understand there motivation and the story is now much more better developed. Every sentence makes sense, every scene has a certain meaning and fits into the ""great picture"". Like ""Gladiator"" or ""Kingdom of Heaven"" you will feel now a kind of Shakespeare-spirit in this movie. You have differente levels which are now and finally combined in a very smooth and intelligent way: the love story, the political background and Robin Hood as political outlaw, who fights for the poor and ""left behind"". Thank you Mr. Scott for this great re-invention of one of the most popular historical persons (and first socialist in the western world ;-))",Robin Hood
493,gurvinder62,Far Below Expectations !!!,5,1 September 2010,"Just finished watching. I expected to see the story of an outlaw hero who rebel against bad and was friend of good and poor ! where the hell was that robin hood !!! after 20-25 minutes i realized i was watching the ""making of the outlaw robin hood"" instead of ""the outlaw robin hood"" ! i wanted to leave...! then i thought that it is a 2:30 hr movie and he might be declared outlaw somewhere near the intermission and i waited for it but it came just before the end !!! the excitement i was waiting for never came ! Talking of storyline...its poorly written ...and even poorer were the writing of roles of king john and Godfrey that could have provided much to the otherwise boring storyline ! direction was average and the action scenes were poor.comparisons are bound to happen specially in the case of period movies. Robin Hood was no where near the gladiator or troy! i missed the grandeur of period movies! my advice to those who haven't seen it yet is to let is pass by quietly and wait for the sequel!",Robin Hood
494,EthanEdwards1,major disappointment,4,16 May 2010,"So looking forward to this. Love the genre and really rate the director, writer and cast. This is simply not their best work. Script and editing are the biggest faults. Costumes are great, William Hurt gives the best performance as an historically accurate William Marshall - the best King England never had]. There must be loads of unused footage that better explains the feral boys - but I doubt that it could credibly justify their role in the very historically inaccurate climatic battle. The geography blooper is not as grievous as the Costner howler relating to the Dover Nottingham journey but there is no way that an army would travel from South Yorkshire to the South East coast via the White Horse hill carving.It's a mystery that earlier posters give 10 scores, one adopts it as their favourite movie of all time and another compares it favourably to Lawrence of Arabia !!! surely grounds for banning from IMDb. Not as entertaining as the Curtiz/Flynn masterpiece nor as clever/quirky/different as the terrific Robin & Marian.Maybe the sequel will be better.",Robin Hood
495,jamesmatt15,Very good film!,9,17 May 2010,This film strives away from the story we all know about robin hood and is set before the time of the merry men and stealing of the rich to give to the poor!This time around I think history played a bigger part in the film as the film is set in England in a time leading up to the signing of the Magna Carta charter and Ridley Scott has successful adapted his portrayal of Robin hood around this.This film was great fun to watch and Robin's friends Will and Little John gave this film a bit of comedy. The action is fantastic and keeps you on the edge of your seat wondering what is going to happen next.I think that the people that didn't like this film compare it too much to gladiator and because of this it gets slated by some critics.In conclusion I would highly recommend this filmDefinitely a must watch...,Robin Hood
496,charlesfoche,Brave Old World,4,17 May 2010,Ridley Scott is going towards his old form again. This is better than his Jerusalem epic which sank in to the sands it was showing. I've been waiting for this movie as it was canceled for nearly a year. And a year later and $200 million has resulted in this Crowe/ Scott epic.The pair have said they wanted to work together again since 'Gladiator' and it would be too easy for Scott to retread the Errol Flynne and tights style of Robin Hood.Like the Sean Connery version of the story the movie goes to a French and Crusader backdrop and introduces a Richard I looking rather past his best. The initial battle scene has been part of th e trailers and TV previews and lives up to th hype. Mark Strong playing 'Sir Godfrey' is the villain of the film and appears shortly after; he;s the best thing in the movie and only Max Von Sydow's Sir Walter Loxley matches him. Cate Blanchett's Marion was described in a newspaper as 'more wooden than Sherwood Forest'!A lot of the audience were enjoying this movie but for $200 million there's a lot of sitting on horses in fields.... a lot.The battle scenes are standout but a comparison with 'Saving PRivate Ryan' is fair and so seem unimaginative of rt eh director to recreate.Another disappointment was how little there was of the stage actor Steve Armourae. I've seen him in the movie 'Third Testament' which was in some cinemas last Septemeber and is still not listed on IMDb. Having seen him in a couple of medieval plays he's perfect for this genre. Upsinde was he acted with Mark Strong and then was gone again.Also Armourae does a better Irish accent than Crowe whose voice went through many accents.,Robin Hood
497,sassi775,Loved It!,9,17 May 2010,"Loved it!! Sorry to all those people who don't like it but I really liked this movie- plus another great & real performance by Russell Crowe. Russell does seem to have the ability to seem very ""real"" in his performances, I can only imagine the type of talent this takes. Yeah sure there are 1000's of critics out there, but honestly- you try it for just one day & let's compare the results. Put your ego down & be real enough to say great work! It is probably the most authentic Robin Hood movie yet to be screened. Maybe all the Brits are annoyed that it took an Aussie to do justice to the story & legend of Robin Hood. Come on, enjoy a movie for what it is, entertainment for sure. History channel is for those who want documentaries... for me as I said I loved it & can't wait for the next one, I say bring it on!!!",Robin Hood
498,cwhite1090,Will ride again?,8,17 May 2010,"""They have burnt Peterborough!"" Living near this city the remark raised a chuckle. There are not many laughs in this film as compared to previous versions. The director of Alien has not directed a comedy to my recollection? His 'Robin Hood' or 'Nottingham' as I understood it was titled for a long time has a new version of history that will teachers with their heads in their hands dreading students relying on this as a factual account. French invasion in the twelfth century?Intriguing novelties that were suggested prior to release was that Rusell Crowe would play Robin and The Sheriff. Ultimately a new idea with the relationship to the elder Loxley in the form of Max Von Sydow is welcome and well performed. Indeed Crowe's performance with Sydow was his best acting in the whole film. This and his 'Magna Carta' speech were the 2 occasions where he hit the Midlands accent. The writer Helgeland mixed medieval life with a rewarding political situation. Clearly working closely with Ridley's Nortyhern roots. The casting of King John had a better accent than Crowe despite Isaac being an American actor. His performance was also superior.",Robin Hood
499,mitsimaru,Good movie,9,17 May 2010,"I find go into films like this (title is the same but is a story variant) with a very open mind. I'm glad I did.It was very Ridley Scott. I knew what to expect of the film the King Richard was killed in battle and Crowe's character was named Robin Longstride instead of Locksley. It reminded me of Gladiator in some points, maybe a bit too much. The fight scene's were not as violent, very little blood, as Gladiator but were gripping enough.I would like to note that I have not been disappointed by a friar Tuck ever. This friar delivered like all the others.I was surprised at Alan Doyle(Great Big Sea). He performed very well and his music added a nice touch to the film.The first half of the final fight was taken right out of Saving Private Ryan though. Even the French boats resembled that of the American ones.all in all a good movie worth going to see.",Robin Hood
500,oshahos99,Summer Blockbuster that's high on historical inaccuracies.,3,19 May 2010,"Ridley Scott is back doing what he does best: taking a pseudo-historical figure (in this case Robin Hood, or Robin Longstride as he is called in this film), the documents (Magna Carta) -stroke- facts (Crusades, King John and Richard) -stroke- dates (early 13th century) that are most associated with them, then jumbling all that information into meaningless nonsense, adding a few Gladiator-style battle scenes, sprinkling on CGI, and stitching it together into a two and a half hour film. Robin Hood is an English legend that has been portrayed numerous times in the past, on many media, from Flynn to Costner. Ridley Scott claims that his portrayal is the best yet. Is he right?Straight from the opening minute, the film makes its first mistake in the opening narration, where Scott mistakes the year 1199 for the turn of the 12th century (ie. 1099 AD). Not a good start for what is supposed to be the best portrayal yet. Unfortunately, it sets the tone for the rest of the movie, plagued by historical inaccuracies.King Richard dying of his arrow wounds in the battlefield in minutes (he took several days to die), John only plundering England after Richard's death and only during the Angevin conflict (he was plundering England well before either event), an Eleanor of Aquitaine opposing the marriage of John to Isabella (she was in favour of it), a King John who apparently supports the Magna Carta (he was vehemently opposed to it and was forced to sign it), Robin Hood siding with King John, a Battle of Bouvines that takes place in Dover (Bouvines is in France), Maid Marian as an active participant of that battle (despite being female), the French using anachronistic D-Day boats, a French army so stupid they choose to fight on a cliffside where they know they'll be skirmished to death (Hollywood spits at Sun Tzu again), and the English winning the battle (it was actually the French)--just some of the historical inaccuracies which I'm willing to overlook.What I cannot overlook, is that this film contains almost no material from the ballads of Robin Hood. These are the stories that give the characters in Robin Hood their charm and entertainment. No mention of how the merry men met, the Sheriff of Nottingham being relegated to a cameo, and no robbing of the rich nor giving to the poor. Replacing it is another Ridley Scott romp which spends more time shuttling people between different towns or the battle of the day rather than character development.On the plus side, the film does contain some strong performances by the entire cast. The scenes with Crowe and von Sydow are charming, Strong makes for a thrillingly well-rounded villain, the chemistry between Blanchett and Crowe solid(albeit slightly on the old side). The battles are very entertaining and the weaponry well researched. The storyboarding is quite effective as is the music. However, Scott has made a mistake by discarding the tried and tested-for-centuries Robin Hood ballads and replacing it with a never tried, never tested script of his own making.The odd production fault (such as the film's tagline, ""rise and rise again, until lambs become lions"" is unreadable on the stone slabs / swords it was carved on, and Cate's noticeable trip up in one of the scenes) doesn't help matters. Robin Hood: Prince of Thieves is more faithful to the original Ballads, and more entertaining. Scott's version is definitely not the best ever version of Robin Hood.In short, a quite entertaining summer blockbuster hampered by its faithlessness to the legend and with more historical inaccuracies than a vandalised Wikipedia page.",Robin Hood
501,greg_m-778-729055,Its a good watch,7,30 June 2010,"A good film to watch, and well presented, though a little hurried. I never felt very close to any of the characters, which sort of took a lot away from the atmosphere for me, so I've marked down on that.Many reviewers note the ""WWII"" landing craft. In fact, in the crusades, they did have landing equipment with ramps to allow the men and horses to quickly charge onto the beach, and ship based slings to load horses. Remember, people in the 12th century built enormous castles and battle machines without the aid of a crane or an electric screwdriver, so a boat with a folding down side is not too difficult!! Is the design accurate in this film? Well, probably not.Of course, there are many moments of pure folly, for example, would it be likely that Marrion could have strung a longbow so easily? I doubt it. But this is a film of course, so just go with it, and it's not a bad film.",Robin Hood
502,anton_svantesson,Great film!!!,7,10 September 2010,"I saw Ridley Scott's ""Robin Hood"" when it had it's premiere. My expectations weren't sky high, because ""Robin Hood"" has been filmed so many times. So what more is there to squeeze from the story? When the film was over I was largely impressed. The tone, environments, the fight scenes, the directing, the great cast. etc.SPOILER ALERT!!! Robin Longstride (Russell Crowe) is an archer for Richard Lionheart. He is fed up with battles and the crusades. Then suddenly Lionheart dies in battle and his friend Robert Loxley. Robin vows that he will return the sword to Walter Loxley (Max Von Sydow). In Nottingham Prince John has taken over the crown and begins his tyranny. Robin returns to Nottingham and meets the lovely Marion (Cate Blanchett). Loxley takes him on as his own son. But after a while Robin is discarded from Nottingham. He begins his life as an outlaw. With his mates Little John, Will Scarlett, and Alan.This was truly a great film. Ridley Scott is one of the major directors of his time. His movies are more or less great. Of course there are some flaws in his resume. A Good Year was just god awful and G.I Jane was also a terrible movie. But one can not forget Alien, Blade Runner, Gladiator, Black Rain, American Gangster, Body of Lies and Robin Hood. I loved the action in the movie. The time-period is very authentically depicted. Russell Crowe is a much more better Robin Hood than Kevin Costner's lousy version of the brave outlaw. Cate Blanchett is very good as Marion. Mark Strong is great as Sir Godfrey. A nasty villain. Even though he'll never match Alan Rickman's unforgettable sheriff of Nottingham. This by far the best Robin Hood movie! Great entertainment",Robin Hood
503,artnsews,Not worth watching,1,19 September 2010,The plot was very confusing and disjointed and was not easy to follow. I did not read anything or watch previews before seeing the film. But I did think I would be seeing an expanded and updated classic story of Robin Hood. Russel Crowe's slight verbal parts did not add to his character instead he had no personality at all. The characters were not well defined so it was confusing who was who. The movie did not establish the plot leaving you wondering what and where it was taking you. There was nothing fun and adventurous about this film and there was no comedy relief that we have come to expect from Robin Hood and his Merry Men. It was seriously bland and boring effectively putting people to sleep!!! If you are looking for action and fight scenes you will not be disappointed but that is all this film has to offer.,Robin Hood

Let's hope the sequel is better:) Cuz it will come sooner or later, Australian Robin Hood or not :)That being said, I really loved the action in this film. Much more than the "" prince of thieves"" which many regard as THE Robin Hood film of this century. This film had tons of action and therefore,in my opinion, is a better one.

505,mbenweston,Horrendous. 2 1/2hrs of my life I can't get back.,1,26 September 2010,"Seeing the average score of this film on IMDb and loving the Scott/Crowe partnership I thought this film was looking like a winner despite the dubious Robin Hood story.However, I was unpleasantly surprised with one of the worst films I have ever had the misfortune to watch. I am a huge movie fan and can usually watch even the most unpopular of films to end, however, this film had me very bored very quickly.It's not just the historical inaccuracies (of which there are many), or even the physical and geographical errors (Kate Blanchett swinging a longsword and tugging on a longbow? and white cliffs at Dungeness?), it was the appalling storyline and script. Why Americans are so fascinated with the whole concept of Robin Hood is beyond me, but why make up another story around the same person? I still don't understand why there was a forest full of urchins living in Sherwood or where Richard the Lionheart's conquering army vanished to after he was killed in France. How did 300 Frenchmen convince the whole of England that the King was robbing and killing them instead? Crossing the English channel in beach landing craft with oars? Who was the historian working with this production? Just pure madness and I've not even started on Russell Crowe's accent, which was a cross between Irish/Scottish/Australian and Liverpudlian.Steer clear, Robin Hood ""men in tights"" was a more realistic storyline.",Robin Hood
506,RoyScheider,The worst film in years.....,1,4 December 2010,"This is truly the worst film of the year by far..Cate Blancett could be the worst actor on the planet. and i used to be a Russell fan. This was truly crap.....Boring from start to finish, thank god we will always have Kevin and the Prince of thief's, is not good it's beyond me why they went with this cast and story very sad. I never watched it in the cinama i got it on DVD and i will never watch it again. But this is my veiw not other peoples so it is always good to read what other people think. There was some other films that came out 2009 ----2010 that have been terrible as well so thats life and we go on.......Ps i might review Sherlock Holmes as well not a fan...........",Robin Hood
507,Cruixer,Awful,1,27 March 2011,"I went into this with a completely open mind, expecting a good Saturday night type blockbuster movie. I was not expecting a serious historical film at all but this was bordering on the ridiculous. Russel Crowes English accents seemed to be Liverpool one minute and Yorkshire the next, and on occasion even an Irish accent drifting in. The attempt to align Robin Hood with Magna Carta was a bit flimsy, and I wondered if the bizarre involvement of the French as plotting invaders was an attempt to exploit racism in some English/American audiences - if so this would seem quite vile as I have never heard of a Robin Hood story before this had any involvement of French as bad guys.At this stage Robin Hood has been done to death and I think this is the worst of them so far. It shows the lack of imagination in Holloywood that they have to keep remaking Robin Hood and the 3 musketeers every 10 years.",Robin Hood
508,talktosus,Historically meticulous and AWESOME!,10,18 September 2021,I'm a Robin Hood aficionado and this is one of my favorite renditions because it's accurate to the times it was set in and tells a plausible story. I hope Mr. Scott makes a sequel that explores the myth more!,Robin Hood
509,bdevilder,Really liked it,10,7 January 2015,"I really liked it. OK, not the same old Robin Hood Ledgend, But a great twist and the start of the legend. Great acting from Crowe and Blanchett. Made me laugh and cry. Great, Great, Great.What people seem to be beefing about is because it's not the old same storyof Robin Hood. Great that someone had the brains of makinga film that has not got hr same boring story. I liked the acting. I liked the story, I liked the fight scenes. You could say I liked everything about the film. Go on, give it a try.I think Russell Crowe is perfect for this type of film.Cate Blanchet is an outstanding Actress and can play any part she wants to.",Robin Hood
510,rayevans-1,Oh dear,3,4 September 2010,"Oh dear,what a disappointment! I watched this film with an open mind, despite the rumours of funny accents and whatnot. I am a (female) fan of Russell Crowe, and when I saw the rest of the cast list I had great expectations. Unfortunately, the screen play was just plain awful, soulless, and frankly, completely lacked emotion, as well as having some odd modern things thrown in from time to time. There were some incredibly bizarre accents - Cate Blanchett seemed to do OK, but there seemed to be a bit of Scottish, Irish, and in Rusell Crowe's case, Yorkshire, Liverpool and yes, a hint of Irish from time to time. Strangely there was also some urchin boy who had a Belfast accent. I am sorry to say, that this was actually quite distracting at times, and with the combined poor dialogue to start with, left the main characters completely flat and lacking in any emotional passion, pain or anything else.I am extremely fond of Gladiator, and whilst it is unfair to compare two films, there was some pure Gladiator shots (I know this as I have seen Gladiator 27 times!), which just felt like a Ridley rip-off of the punters, and as if Ridley himself simply couldn't be bothered to do something new - it almost felt like it was a ""formulaic"" film using many Gladiator bits and stealing others bits from other films. I would really like to say, that at the very least, Russell Crowe was the best thing in a bad film, but alas, I cannot even say that.Ultimately, I think Ridley tried to put too much stuff into one film, and as a result, every aspect of it was thin, lacking, plot less, unrealistic, and completely without passion.You are better off watching Gladiator - it wasn't perfect, but it was darn good, and about 500% better than Robin Hood. So disappointed!",Robin Hood
511,randyshahan,awesome story! loved it,10,10 January 2019,I completely dont understand why this movie has such bad reviews? the acting and storyline are great! its set up for a sequel. i know it will most likely not get created but a sequel is absolutely due!,Robin Hood
512,bubadr,Big Stars...Low Entertainment,5,15 May 2010,"To start with, i'm a big fan of Kevin Reynold's Robin Hood: Prince of Thieves back in 1993. Not to mention that it features my favorite song ever ""Everything I do"" for Brian Adams. However, I cannot really compare the two stories as for 1993 it tells the story of the outlaw who became the prince of thieves, but in Ridley Scott's version it tells the story the archer who became an outlaw...or as it says, the beginning of the legend.Having said that, it's just not convincing enough to have Russell Crowe as Robin Hood. Size and age did not really help. Cate Balnchet was also not as what Marion is expected to be. The performance was not really what's been expected from academy award winners!! I really didn't enjoy the movie. The suspense was not there. The war action wasn't up to the level of the previous Ridley Scott's movies. The love story between Robin and Marion was not even clear. So many plots within the movie ,that i really don't want to mention here so I don't spoil the movie, that don 't make sense or don't really make the movie much enjoyed.I had great expectations about the movie before seeing it, though i was a bit skeptical about Russell being Robin Hood, but i was surprised that such an ordinary movie that can be better watched on DVD comes from three of Hollywood's biggest stars.Bottom line, I was really disappointed!",Robin Hood
513,garrvanorden,The best movie of the year.,10,18 October 2010,"I was both shocked and excited when we found out that Robin Hood was going to be rated PG-13. From the previews it looked like a Robin Hood version of Gladiator because both were directed by Ridley Scott and the main star of both is Russel Crow. It wasn't exactly what I was expecting. It's more of an origin story of Robin Hood, whereas the previews make it look like the typical robbing from the rich to give to the poor. There were so many good things about this movie. The score is spectacular. I already bought the soundtrack. The acting is fantastic. The action is phenomenal, and it's a really good story. It did get a lot of negative reviews from critics, but I think that was mostly because the story wasn't what they were expecting and it's not as gay and marry as previous versions of Robin Hood. It is fairly violent, but if you can take that then I highly recommend it. I saw it twice in the 1st 2 weeks, and now I own it on Blu-ray. This new Robin Hood movie is serious and dark and gritty and awesome. The following is a comparison of the different Robin Hood movies to the various Batman incarnations: The Adventures of Robin Hood (1938 ) is as to The 60s Adam West Batman as Robin Hood (Disney 1973) is as The Batman Animated Series as Robin Hood: Prince of Thieves (1991) is as Tim Burton's Batman as Robin Hood (2010) is as Batman Begins as The sequel to Robin Hood (2010) will be as The Dark Knight.",Robin Hood

515,laughingjkings,Truly awful film,1,3 October 2010,"A truly awful film - the dialogue was clunky and almost GCSE level, the acting was turgid and cliché, the bad guys were stereotypically bad and clumsy in their badness, racism in gallons, and don't even get me started on historical inaccuracies (which I can forgive as it is ultimately a fantasy). The best part of the film was Max von Sydow who was brilliant, and a nod must go to the tree in scene 5 for it's astounding ability to out act Russell Crowe. I can't believe this director also made Gladiator and Alien. If you accept that this is a revisionist attempt on the Robin Hood myth, then you also have to accept that revision should also attempt to present a more interesting angle on the character. Bring back Alan Rickman, all is forgiven, even Kevin's dubious accent",Robin Hood
516,houkka-1,Is it legal?,2,31 October 2010,"It should not be legal to make a movie like this, short and simple. Just don't watch it, it would be better to spend the same amount of time watching ants go by than to see this movie.I do not even dare to start to tell you what is wrong with this movie, there are so many things so so terribly wrong that even to try to remember them makes my insides turn upside down.I have been a IMDb user for many many years and I have seen my share of bad movies, but this one, oh for hood's sake, this is just too much.This movie was so bad, that I just had to make my first review of a movie ever.If you are thinking of watching this movie, just don't.

The action scenes are shite nothing new or exciting The acting is pretty dull the actors seemed like they were just going through the motions Take my advice give it a miss waste of 2+ hours I cant believe it leaves it open for a sequel i hope they don't make it.,Robin Hood

519,pokopoom,Another unappreciated film.,9,5 December 2019,"I LOVE this movie. I've always loved Robin Hood and this movie satisfied that love and gave more. I strongly urge people to only watch the directors cut because it really fleshes the movie out. The editing in the theatrical version can be a bit stunted in some parts.
I adore Russel Crowe in this role. I know so many people complained about him but I have absolutely no complaints. I loved his voice, his solemn but powerful approach to the character of Robin. What I loved most was watching his expressions in scenes where he isn't the focus. Very much in character and he successfully managed to portray a variety of emotions without speaking in those scenes which was a treat to watch.
The story has only one moment where I notice it loses people usually but I really enjoyed it because it really sets the stage for who Robin will become in later stories. I was never bored, although that might have been helped by the fact that I LIVE for medieval stories. I also fell in love with the entire supporting staff and Marion.
Which brings me to the romance. IT'S SO GOOD. Without ever feeling as if it's shoving it in your face or forcing it, the romance is one of my favorite parts of the movie because it's so well paced. The chemistry between Robin and Marion is exactly what I wanted from a medieval setting and I actually swooned at one point. I loved how well Cate and Russel played their roles. A beautiful and believable courtship.
I really feel strongly about this movie because it has everything I want in a medieval piece and I think it was well done. Inspires me everytime I see it.",Robin Hood
520,axexisinb,this is not Robin Hood,1,17 September 2010,"1. This is not a movie about Robin Hood the legend, but about Robin Longstride. So instead of a green, lean rogue we get a dark, boring know-it all (Crowe).2. This is not about compelling storytelling. It's a mish mash of muddled stories, none of them interesting.3. This is not about believable fighting scenes. Kids on ponies (!!!!!) and old maid Marion (Blanchett) are equal to trained soldiers with shield, sword and chainmail. 4. This is not about believable archery. To master an English longbow one needed to train daily and develop lots of muscles to shoot it (670– 900 N (150–200 pounds)). But old maid superCate could draw and shoot the bow with no problem at all.5. This movie seems to be about World war II. The bad French king wants to invade good old England, so he uses an evil agent (Isaac) to destabilize the country. King John, portrayed as a raving idiot, sends him out to forcibly collect taxes. Instead of just doing that his black-clad troops act like bloodthirsty Waffen SS, killing everyone indiscriminately.Then more French troops land on a beach with WWII landing craft just to run around foolishly. Arrows are shot at them like machinegun-bullets causing the same kind of losses and despair as in Saving Private Ryan. After some really ridiculous fighting Crowe delivers a miracle shot with a wet bow, brings the drowned maid back to life and gets, as an after thought, banned.6. This movie is not about bright colours. It's dark and depressing.",Robin Hood
521,davie-cooperfan,A slow moving film that bears no resemblance to any real Robin Hood story,1,12 May 2010,"The accents are all over the place, a cross between Irish, Scottish, Yorkshire, and probably many others. The story is slow moving with nowhere near enough action. Many around me complained too. The characters, particularly the Sheriff of Nottigham, are weak. Little John, Alan A-Dale, and Will Scarlett bear little resemblance to their storybook characters. Friar Tuck is not as bad. Maid Marion is ...well, not a maid. In fact she is Lady Marion and married to Robin of Loxley.Nottingham Castle and Sherwood Forest could do with a bit more exposure in the movie too.A big thumbs down from Nottigham.",Robin Hood
522,kleinjoeng,strange experience,1,20 June 2010,"What an abomination. This was the greatest disappointment in 5 years I got from a movie I was eager to see. Some critics I respect said nice things about it, I guess this makes it kinda weird. It was terrible. Gruesome even. Can't understand how so much money was obtained to make this film. The beginning, is quite alright. But as the films grows longer, you're staring to wonder how the people in this movie are feeling. There are no characters. None. Even robin stays as shallow as an ashtray. The biggest disappointment is that there are only two parts where robin actually shows any bow-skills. The ending reminded me of warmovies representing d-day, but it didn't make any sense. There is also a particular scene where a french soldier holds a torch against a wooden column supporting a house and it lights up in flames like if it was drenched in gasoline. It does make you realize how hard it is to make a good movie tough. Which is why I gave it one star.",Robin Hood
523,ariel_seas,Not as good as I hoped,4,13 August 2014,"I enjoyed Friar Tuck and his bees.Otherwise it was hard to follow, with countless locations that include France, the river Thames, Nottingham, and Sherwood Forest. It also includes a twisted back story about Robin, unexplained children of the forest who wear voodoo masks, and a pro-French cause Englishman who is bald and never existed and Robin Hood's name is Robin Longstride..who never existed (to my knowledge)honestly i stopped watching it when I got to the maps because it was well past an hour and nothing interesting you would expect of Robin Hood happened (with the exception of stealing grain from the church of York.",Robin Hood
524,alan-peabody,A darned good romp,8,13 May 2010,"As everyone else says forget about the stories you have heard about Robin Hood. This is a prequel. Actually you might as well forget everything you ever learned about medieval history as well. In fact just suspend all belief in reality. It starts in a fairly unlikely fashion with King Richard the Lionheart storming a castle in France (he did do a bit of that it must be admitted although probably not in the way depicted here) and ends in a huge set piece battle with an invading French army equipped with the wooden equivalent of the kind of landing craft used on the D Day Normandy landings, soldiers storming the beach and dying in the water with arrows ripping through the surface like bullets. Marion can match any hulking swordsman and does on occasion, except for the magnificently evil Godfrey, but that's another thing and although I've warned for spoilers I don't intend to spoil the movie, just set the scene.And that's the point. Suspend normality, ignore that Robin and his mates all appear to have Irish accents (probably the best RC could do), sit back and enjoy the totally preposterous ride. It's terrific fun and I can't wait for the sequel(s).",Robin Hood
525,jeremyrowe,If you liked Costner in The Postman and Waterworld.... this is for you,1,20 May 2010,"I am staggeringly disappointed by this film. Great cast, phenomenal director and a solid hero story to build upon or reinvent. Ignoring the plethora of historical inaccuracies I just found the implicit request to entirely suspend belief a request too far. Robin Longstride, common archer, becomes a seemingly fully trained medieval knight more than capable with bow, sword, hammer both on horseback or on foot simply by putting on a suit of armour (medieval Ironman anyone). French soldiers that row 20 miles across the English channel before heading in to battle is equally ridiculous as is the impoverished Marion having a ladies suit of chain mail just hanging around (armour wasn't cheap!). Even if I had managed to overcome such oversights, the bottom line is I just didn't care about any of the characters.My greatest fear now is the inevitable sequel",Robin Hood
526,bradvincent,Quite possibly one of the worst films of the last 10 years,1,18 May 2010,"Ahh... where to begin. The movie starts harmlessly enough. Mideval action sequence with the ever present ultra violence with every modern action director pulling out his cock and proving that he can show war up close with all of the reality and chaos war entails. It started really with ""Saving Private Ryan"" and has now been copied ad nauseum. From the that point on it was steadily downhill. Sitting through the movie, I was constantly reminded of just why I dislike Russel Crowe. The furrowed brow and sidelong glance with slacked jaw can only carry you so far. Much akin to the clenched jaw of Tom Cruise or spitting invective of John Malkovich. Tired methods that work once or twice and convert them to one trick ponies. I digress... Plot sequence was poorly constructed. The film editing was absolutely atrocious and the whole ""shaky camera"" with weird angles that make you feel like you are constantly looking up through the slat-boards of a cellar to see what's going on in the house feel grows weary. Never mind the ridiculous construct that keeps Robert aka ""Robin"" in Nottingham in the first place, the plot was poorly cohesive throughout. Take the bad parts of ""Joan of Arc"", ""A Knight's Tale"", ""Braveheart"" and throw them together, you will have the basic parts of this movie. Much too long, much too boring and not worth the money.",Robin Hood
527,Gwenhwyfar28,Awful!,2,8 September 2010,"Considering that this was another Russell Crowe/Ridley Scott partnership I was semi expecting this rendition of Robin Hood to be something similar to Gladiator. I usually trust Ridley Scott to artistically glide over some of his negligible historical blunders and to be fair, the film started quite well, I liked the idea a tough/ weary Maid Marian with what I could have SWORN was a Yorkshire accent??Prince John was in a word hilarious and I was pleased to see William Marshall who was the Earl of Pembroke, good friend to Eleanor Of Aquitaine and a member of a council that ran the country while King Richard was crusading. As heir apparent John would have had power but at this point the country was run by Queen Eleanor and the council, at that point he couldn't have fired Marshall...ah, never mind. 40minutes into the film and I honestly have no idea what kind of accent Crowe is trying to affect, one minute it sounds Welsh, then Yorkshire then his fall back generic accent he used in Gladiator with the odd Irish sounding word *sigh* The plot so far was making sense, it made perfect sense for Robin and his troop to pretend to be Sir Robert Loxley in order to get home. And then for them to settle themselves in Nottingham. Von Sydow was a true pleasure to watch! As were the general high jinx of the Merry Men. I also liked Mark Addy's Friar Tuck! Yay Bees and Mead!!Matthew MacFayden's Sheriff seems to me to be both a bit blah and insipid; at his most comical he seems like a poor imitation of the Sheriff of Nottingham from BBC's Robin Hood TV series ...a clue..no! Mark Strong is another actor I really rate, but in this his motivation here seems to have been generic bad guy, with a scar and everything! As he's laying siege to Northern England we notice Peterborough named as a place attacked....oh dear! Mr. Scott should really shoot his English researchers! Peterborough is not in the North! Of course all of this doesn't really bother me until we discover Crowe's father was actually Stone Mason Longstride who thought up the original content of the Magna Carta??!! (WTF?) Of course this gives Crowe the right to bomb around giving orders to everyone including William Marshall and Earl FitzRobert? (the only two actual Barons/Earls mentioned in this absolute travesty of the Baron's War) oh sorry, I forgot the fictional Baron Baldwin...*sigh* The fight on the beach was the crowning balls up of this entire film! I can hardly bear to watch as Crowe organises the King and Earls to face the French in their Saving Private Ryan landing boats but then when Marion gallops onto the beach in full mail with her 'army' of small children on stunted ponies taking on fully armed French soldiers with handmade weapons I started to feel as if Ridley Scott was actually taking the mickey!But as to the French, haven't they got the wrong King? It was Prince Louis who launched the invasion of England, not his father Phillip, but then again, if Phillip could have got his hands on WW2 landing craft he probably would have invaded! The rest of the film is summed up in about five minutes, oh look, everyones outlaws now! Pah! This film could have been quite good if they'd actually stuck to fact!!",Robin Hood
528,Teraplane5,Ridley Scott's rich textured take on 13th Century England,4,19 May 2010,"The movie gets off to a bad start with a sub-title saying ""On the eve of the 12th Century,"" and then has a sub-title ""1199"". Excuse me, who is in charge here? 1199 is the eve of the 13th Century. So from that point on, historical anomalies compound and unmotivated story elements materialize out of the blue and it all conspires to break the suspension of disbelief necessary to lose one's self in the story.It is full of action and battles for the guys and a really lame love story for the women. A love story that is more fitting for a movie made back in the days of the puritanical Hayes Code than it is for today's audience. Since the dialogue can be sparse, I suspect that the above elements are designed to make the film easy to sub-title, dub and market for foreign distribution.I enjoyed it more than Iron Man Deuce for the simple reason that it is a story where the action figures are people and not machines. If you can suspend your ability to question character motivation and buy into the sweep of events unquestionably, it's worth the price of admission. If you prefer movies that move the audience by honest emotions not connected to an adrenaline rush, skip this one.",Robin Hood
529,anubis814,A definite must-see!!!,8,10 May 2010,"O yeah i can sense a lot of people out there are having negative feelings towards this movie but all I have to say is that JUST SEE IT!! I thought the acting was flawless and epic settings take control of you from the get-go. Russell Crowe's near ""Maximus"" reprisal is seen throughout the movie more often than none but he still nails. This version blows Kevin Costner's out of the water. I though mark strong also gave an awesome performance as the sheriff of nottingham and as so Oscar Issac who plays the bratty King John. Now in a sense it is Gladiator set in Medieval England but taking that Gladiator was a bad ass movie anyways its pretty reassuring that they put the same if not more, effort into making this as best as they could.

530,WisdomplusKnowlege,Where this movie went wrong.,5,18 May 2010,"I went to see Robin Hood, a story I very much enjoy, who would be acted out by Russel Crowe, who in my opinion made gladiator into the brilliant film it is. What I saw was not Robin Hood, it was a long film portraying the events of what seemed to be the week before he became an outlaw, the week in which he returned to England.We have all come to know Robin Hood as the noble who sacrificed his title to help the poor, to stand up for whats right. In this movie ""Robin Hood"" was a stone mason's son turned orphan, who deserted the Kings Army after the King died, and then took up a title which wasn't his... a complete contradiction.We all know Marrion to be a Lady with Royal blood. Here she was portrayed as a nobody married by a noble. Why? Who knows, the actress neither has a sweet voice nor is especially easy on the eyes.The Legendary Robin Hood was about an outlaw who was the best of the best with a bow and arrow, yet what we saw in this movie portrayed a so called archer who killed more men with his sword than with an arrow... make sense? I think not.This movie had the potential to be great- but in this one story we had 3 legendary people each with their own story, two of whom were given far too much time- King Richard and Prince John, and Robin Hood himself not given enough.Russel Crowe is a great actor, he has a presence of authority surpassed by none. He was perfect in Gladiator, he would do better as maybe King David, or Julios Ceasar... maybe even as King Richard himself- a film about the crusades when as shown in this film, King Richard lead from the front? Russel Crowe can't portray the gentleness that the legendary Robin Hood had, the compassion...he cannot be ""Robin Hood and his merry men"".",Robin Hood

(should i say more?!) 4) the love emotion in the movie are out of context and seems unreal or some may say pathetic.5)the kings both English and France one come out as pathetic or just horribly stupid..i could go on and on.. to make it short this movie was a totally waste of time.. made me unhappy.. and well after the 10 first second which weren't bad it just got worst in each moment.. till may only wish was that it will end..some may say it like king Arthur in which they tall the story of the ""real"" story and not the tale.. but i say if the ""real"" thing is that bad (not like king Arthur movie which was far..) i rater not know the ""real"" story..so just don't go.. please don't..

532,eline-editor,See this film if you want real cinema as opposed to just video game special effects.,10,30 May 2010,"An absolutely brilliant film. Superb dialog, beautiful cinematography. Sensual with breathtaking action, and a plot that doesn't quit. The chemistry between Robin and Marianne is great. And what's the point of making a new movie if you're not going to give it a new twist. For all of you who want the same old narrative -- go back to the same old movies. I think Ridley Scott has given us a new perspective that gives depth and meaning to the story which I'd never encountered. It also leaves lots of options for Robin Hood Part II.As for this film -- you get lost in the story from the beginning and hope it never ends. What a treat to see an adventure story with some real actors instead of just ex-models and splashy special effects that act as a substitute for real story telling.The set up is a little long -- we could do with more Friar Tuck and less of Richard The Lion Heart who is the blandest character in the film. King John is archetypal as the villain, and his little French mistress smolders on the screen.Please Ridley -- keep making films like this!!!",Robin Hood
533,outcinema,Good Matter. Bad Matter.,5,13 May 2010,"Some month ago i read a review about this movie and i learned that this movie was not so good as I hoped. In this review, was considered a work-print copy. So many things could have been changed until the final cut. 2 days ago finally i watched it: very very sad. OK! Robin Hood is always Robin Hood....but in this movie, where is Robin Hood? Ridley Scott examines a long war period between France and England. OK. The matter is not so bad and pheraps it was in the director academic intentions to talk about the war. Like the confused and boring plot of 'Kingdom of Heaven', this Robin Hood makes the same mistakes: bad writing and wrong characters. Like a boring school professor, a boring school lesson: bad way of telling interesting characters and historical period. A waste of time. And the first problem is the MAIN character: Robin Hood. As Stephen Sommers did for his Van Helsing, Scott does the same thing for Robin Hood: he could be anyone. This character is not so interesting, he looks too William Wallace and many other 'historical heroes', but he has not appeal or grace. And if in a movie called 'Robin Hood', Robin Hood is the only and useless element of the movie, this is a real problem. Ridley Scott said the best Robin Hood ever for him is 'Mel Brook's Robin Hood - Men in Tights'...he's right. Ridley Scott - Director in Tights.At the end, the last 3 comments: 1) Why turn everything into fake academic? 2) Why a movie about Robin Hood must be so staid? Some irony is not so bad... 3) Of 150 mins, i would cut at least over an hour. Redundant hour.",Robin Hood
534,vscdeveloper,Boring Tail of Sleepiness and Cliché's,1,21 May 2010,"If you want to watch boring shots of horses running back and forth, useless shots of European landscape; then this movie is for you. Honestly the 2.5 hour movie could have been cut down to just an hour if all the B roll was left on the editing room floor. The first 60 seconds of the movie gives away how bad the rest of it will be when it starts out with an explanation of the story which you have to read and it is written on what looks like parchment as non-dramatic music plays in the background. Actually all of the soundtrack is incredibly non-dramatic and out right boring. A few action scenes keep you awake during the film, but are filled with overly cliché shots like Russell Crowe emerging from the water with his water pouring down his face... yawn.",Robin Hood
535,sixtyDotNine,Incomplete Combustion,6,14 May 2010,"With an elite name such as Russell Crowe, and a title such as Robin Hood, you expect something along the lines of a decent action movie; if not spectacular, pretty darn close. But with so much potential, the movie ends up as an entertaining pile of wasted potential and hence, incomplete combustion. Robin Hood is no gladiator-calibre movie. With predecessors such as Errol Flynn's 1938 masterpiece behind you it's not doubt difficult to come close, but you at least try, and hope that (at least) it will be better than Kevin Costner's prince of thieves take. But no.Russell Crowe once again is fantastic and shines along with the rest of the acting, making the movie enjoyable, at best. However the writing was absolutely over-the-top predictable. I left the theatre feeling that the movie's entire purpose was to set up a sequel, and boy, although the sequel has just as much (if not more potential) how many people are going to see it after a disappointment like this? 3/5 stars because of Crowe, who saves the movie from becoming a complete disaster. The best part of the film was 10 minutes before it concluded, when good ol' John declared Robin Hood an outlaw. This created the suspense and hope that there would be a twist, perhaps after a predictable movie, Robin would struggle and not utterly (and overly luckily...) dominate his opponents. Without conflict or suspense the movie delivered, with 10 minutes left. As the thought of leaning forward, anticipating something more, I strained my neck just as the credits began to roll and the amusing animated credits started to play as all hope diminished. Robin Hood (the animated one!) was my favourite movie as a child, and I was truly disappointed (hence my first in-depth analytical review-turned-rant).There was only one scene of ""robbing the rich to feed the poor"" in the entire movie, perhaps the sequel will deliver more to the poor people who just wasted their 2 hours and 20 minutes to have left the theatre robbed.",Robin Hood
536,pete-fol,Ridley Scott completes his fall from grace.,1,12 May 2010,"This film opens with a lacklustre action scene and goes downhill from there. The whole feel is one of a poorly made film, the action scenes have no real sense of scale, acting is poor and the screenplay is worse. This film is littered with cringe-worthy Hollywood clichés and loses any semblance of authenticity with the smattering of unusual 'British' accents that pervade throughout. What regional accent was Russel Crowe actually going for? Sometimes he sounds like a scouser, other times a Scot and other times a Yorkshire man. Mostly however he sounds like an Australian who has lived in America for a while and is now trying to sound British.Whether the viewing public has got dumber or the film studios have got smarter I do not know, but it seems too often these days that film quality has zero effect on box office profits. Why put any effort in when success is guaranteed? Why even think of an original idea? Take a well known story, a has-been director and enough dollars as big names can buy with enough left over for a more than adequate advertising campaign and you'll have instant profit. When was the last time a disappointment by the likes of Burton, Mann, Fincher etc. was unsuccessful?Anyway, after an hour and s half of frustration I finally had enough. With no interest to any of the characters and no curiosities regarding the plot, I out-weighed my stubborn will to get what I paid for. Needless to say I left. Awful.",Robin Hood
537,caddeville,A terrible disappointment...,3,19 October 2010,"I watched this coming from an angle of liking Russell Crowe's other performances, and bowing to his suitability in the genre of ""epic films"". I also have somewhat of an appreciation for the historical period depicted. This flick so wants to be an epic film, but falls way short. I found it campy and predictable. The script was very loose and two-dimensional, especially considering it's predecessors in Robin Hoodlum were well-made, epic films, indeed.The plot is constantly grasping at straws. It wants to be accepted in some historical context that is completely fallacious. The characters are terribly miscast, most notably that of Cate Blanchett, whose inflexible, typical dead-pan fear-and-wonder style of acting was gravely misplaced. The film really has no effective climax, unless that pathetic battle scene at the end could be called so.I really kept wanting this movie to be good. It was really hard to not turn the movie off after a few minutes of agony. It's only saving grace was the beautiful scenery. I hope the filmmakers go back to film school before attempting to waste more of my time with like garbage.",Robin Hood
538,shalumalaka,A thoroughly good watch!!!,8,25 May 2010,"After reading some of the comments left on here before actually going to watch Robin Hood, I thought I wouldn't like the film very much but on the contrary, I absolutely loved it!!! First of all, this is not another Gladiator-type movie and I think a lot of people were expecting it to be just that, given the reunion of Ridley Scott and Russell Crowe after a 10-year gap.This is more of a film with a storyline which precedes the familiar story we're all accustomed to, kind of like the story in Batman Begins. In other words, the story of the character (and others) before they became the legend(s) that we're all familiar with now.I won't spoil the film by mentioning anything at all that happens in it as I would rather recommend that anyone reading this should go and see it for themselves in the theatres before it's taken off. It's definitely a film not to be missed at the cinema.I thought the acting was brilliant. The scenery was awesome, the action (fight scenes) were well-captured, the plot could be deemed as complicated yet also cohesive and entertaining. There were a few hilarious moments too, especially with the immature and inexperienced King John as well as Little John. The music was the only main thing which had a reminiscent feel to that of Gladiator but that did not detract from the film in anyway.The only thing I agree with in the negative reviews is where someone said they'd stolen a similar scene to that of Steven Spielberg's 'Saving Private Ryan' but to me that could simply just be a tribute to history.All I'd say is go check it out for yourself and enjoy!!!",Robin Hood
539,zitkalapi,This is a damn good movie!,9,13 March 2011,"It's not your grandfather's Robin Hood. It's a new take on an old tale. It's not the legendary predictable Robin Hood and Maid Marian and the rest, it simply uses those names to hang a bloody good story on. It plays with legend, and/or history, in the same way that Gladiator and Braveheart and Troy played with it. For openers, Robin Hood is a character of folklore, with no real historical foundation. Why not take a different approach? I find it delightfully refreshing. The acting fits perfectly, low key, not over the top, but thoughtful and precise, not just Crowe and Blanchett, but all the rest. There is not a weak or wooden performance in the whole film, and Ridley Scott did a fine job presenting that, and a fine job making another great flick that, in my humble opinion, stands tall alongside other outstanding Scott works like Alien and Gladiator. A lot of people diss this movie. I think they're a bunch of narrow minded stodgy jerks that can't abide anything that strays from the path, which in this case had already been beaten to death. Fresh, creative, well done. I'm glad I bought it, and I will watch it again, and again. Thank you, Ridly and Russell and Cate and the rest, for a most enjoyable and entertaining movie.",Robin Hood
540,ali_paras,How he started his journey to be a Legend,7,13 May 2010,"Ridley Scott has done a good job directing robin hood as far as the action sequences go, The movie lacked the bonding with the audience. The fight scenes were very well crafted. The movie fails to touch the audience both inspirationally and emotionally.I also thought that the beard look did not suit the character. Don't expect anything like Gladiator or Kingdom of heaven, you will be disappointed. The performances of both Russel and Cate are good, I liked the performance of Max as Sir Walter Loxley the most. Keeping aside all the negative points, this is a good entertainer, go and watch this movie on the big screen, its worth it.",Robin Hood
541,roninwanderers,Not nearly so bad.....,10,20 May 2010,"First off, this is written by a massive Robin Hood fan (as no doubt most of us are) who undertook a study of the real outlaw as his A-Level history project... so yes, I am biased into loving all things RH....I have to say two things struck me on leaving the movie..... it was probably the best Robin Hood adaptation I have ever seen; and the most boring..... but the boring is just because I want the typical romp that fills most Robin Hood films, so something to actually pay attention to other than an arrow splitting another arrow is quite welcome...But I would just like to comment on a few issues, and leave it at that, else I could match my 30 page effort from when I was 18....So many complaints about the fact Crowe's Robin was so proficient with sword/axe/hammer/whatever, when he was meant to be an archer and only any good with a longbow.... maybe, but what of all the other versions, where Robin is rarely bettered with a sword (apart from the classic Praed, my favourite Robin, who in the early episodes looked terrified of his sword in every combat scene)? Who cares, I like my Robins to be awesome with whatever they pick up.Complaints again about beach landings being inaccurate and more reminiscent of D-Day.... well, yes they were similar, but flat-hulled craft did exist to transport horses, etc in those days, so again, it's possible....He wasn't called Robin Hood.... well, no, but this was about his life (or part of it) before he became an outlaw... so yes, it would have been much better if it had been named something different, like ""Loxley"" perhaps? Crowe is too old..... well, he is indeed older that Sean, but again, a youthful Robin wouldn't have been accurate as a Crusader, generally that was a 10 to 15 years tour of duty.....And all the people saying how disappointed they were after ""Gladiator"" and ""Kingdom of Heaven""..... don't forget how panned ""Kingdom"" was, until the Director's Cut emerged and we all suddenly became huge fans.... I suspect ""Hood"" will be the same once the DVD gets clearance for a 15 certificate....So watch, allow for some dull moments unless you're a history buff (and apologies to all history buffs for that comment), and enjoy the action without criticising historical inaccuracies....",Robin Hood
542,under8,Entertaining...,7,7 September 2010,"This is my first review for IMDb inspired by the long dissertation on how disappointing this Robin turned out to be.I, on the other hand believe that all the buggers did a fine & entertaining job. It certainly is no Citizen Kaine & if this Robin Hood does become a trilogy, I do not think it will fair as well as The Lord of the Rings trilogy. One can hope that this Robin Hood will only improve as did TLOTR. Time will tell...As stated, the movie was entertaining. As a prequel it set the story to come rather well. It did run a bit long but it is after all, a large tale. As anyone who has ever had a favorite book turned into a film knows, that film rendition is simply not going to have the nuance that one gets from reading a book at your on pace & with your own vision. So many are so disappointed by the lack of that nuance that they simply cant relax & enjoy the vision of a master director such as Ridley Scott.It is your loss if you go into this movie with unreasonable expectations that will keep you from enjoying this film.I give this movie a 7 of 10. There were, IMO a few CGI flaws & a few slow moments. If the tale continues I hope to see more development among the minor characters.A last thought, if this is the only segment of any proposed trilogy, then this movie is able stand alone.",Robin Hood
543,hyjinkz,It's not Robin Hood,3,7 September 2010,"The film is entertaining but the story is a mess. Too many disparate elements compete for a place forced into a beloved legend that neither needs or has room for the author's ""new take"".The ""re-imagining"" liberties taken with the story stumble into some truly weird territory toward the end of the film when the French try to invade England. Robin allies with King John (yup, King John, no Prince here) to defend the beachhead from the evil French. Naturally, in keeping with today's empowered female sensibilities, Marianne shows up, out of nowhere, dressed in full armor and fights alongside her country-folk. It all became seriously surreal when, lo and behold, the French hit the beaches using medieval versions of WWII Higgins boats. It's as though the film makers wanted to not only remake ""Robin Hood"" but also ""Saving Private Ryan"" all in one film, right down to scenes of soldiers drowning after jumping over the sides of the boats with archery fire hitting them under water.It's a silly and pointless movie that limbs along purely on the strength of a mostly excellent cast.",Robin Hood
544,jeptulia,Waste Of Money,4,21 June 2010,"I won't pretend to be an expert on the original myth of Robin Hood, but regardless this movie was just plain trash. It was so obvious that they were trying so desperately to sell this as another Gladiator movie but it was nowhere near that quality by comparison.The story itself was boring and it was entirely too long. I would have walked out in the first 40 minutes if not for the fact that I was with family friends. There was limited chemistry between Russell Crowe and Cate Blanchet which surprised me. I think they both just showed up for the pay check. The only actor who I think gave a damn about his performance was the unknown actor who played the young king.It's just sad because I think it's quite clear that Russell Crowe and Ridley Scott are in the twilight of their careers. They continue to collaborate but have no reason to as The Gladiator was the only worthwhile film ever to come from that relationship.",Robin Hood
545,ghostnovass,Kevin Costner where are you?,4,19 May 2010,"Let's start with the good... This movie was beautifully shot. Cudo's to the camera crew. And that's about the only positive thing I can say about this ""Cut N paste"" flick. Cut n paste? I will explain...I swear Ridley Scott was running out of time shooting this disaster piece and cheated by cutting and pasting scenes from other movies such as...1.)""SAVING PRIVATE RYAN"". The scene where the french dock their mid-evil PT-109 soldier boats on the beach. This made me giggle like a fat man in a candy store! 2.)""PEARL HARBOR"" Appx 5 mins after Pvt. Ryan I MEAN the French docked on the beach the camera is submerged 10 feet under water looking up at the soldiers swimming above when the jap planes I MEAN arrows pierce through their bodies bloodying the water. Which is funny because just seconds before this shot, all of the soldiers were running around in knee deep water. If you look closely I'm certain you will see a WW2 helmet floating in the water that the CGI crew missed. Come on man! It's the SAME Pearl harbor scene as when all of the American soldiers were swimming to shore after falling off the USS Arizona! 3.)""BEOWOLF"". The pub scene when Robin and his mates make it to Nottingham. I swear I was going to see a animated Angelina Jolie somewhere.And the list goes on and on! If you ever watch this movie again and I have no idea why you would... Pay close attention you will see how a good 40 percent of this flick is blatantly hi-jacked from other GOOD movies.Further more, the entire time Robin and Lady Marian spent together as Characters in this movie they never really established and type of REAL bond. Yet when Robin leaves to fight the French at the end he say's ""I love you"" Seriously? No wonder kids these days ""fall in love"" So easily! Because of poorly written, poorly scripted fecal matter such as this! If Kevin Coaster was dead he would be turning in his grave!

546,g_loring22,Robin Hood Has Never Been Better,10,16 May 2010,"I thought this was an excellent film. Well written, acted directed. I can see why this movie won't appeal to most of the mindless idiots in America because it doesn't have car chases, sex and racial jokes (yeah...this isn't Transformers 2). This is a thoughtful mature movie that reminds me very much of a Rosemary Sutcliff novel. It takes it's time to let the characters develop, and guess what! That makes you actually care about them. Russell Crowe is amazing as usual as the ruggedly attractive and appealing hero. Cate Blanchett the beautiful, strong, yet feminine heroine, played the role perfectly. This is a movie that I will be going back to the theater to see again. If you're not a complete moron who only listens to the ""critics"" and never has an original thought or opinion of his own then go see this movie...you won't be disappointed. And if you are a moron wait until this weekend and go see MacGruber.P.S. Seriously! I don't understand what the critics want in a movie anymore!! (And if anybody says Avatar I will puke). They criticize the fun action movies (ie Iron Man 2) for not having substance. And yet they turn around and criticize the mature action drama (ie Robin Hood) for not being a fun Disney movie in tights. The critics need to get over themselves and stop being such pompous asses...that's right they couldn't find anything real to say about the movie so they criticized Russell Crowe's accent.",Robin Hood
547,diane-macneil-736-399356,What fun!,9,12 May 2010,"What a fun way to spend a couple hours! Forget ""Russell Crowe wearing tights"" as some folks have warned, it's ""Russell Crowe, Cate Blanchett, and all the others having a ROUSING good time""! Russell, of course, is all male, all the time, and can twist just about any character to fit his style. Since in this case it meant Russell picking fights with the villains, it worked really well. Cate is terrific as a reluctant participant in the ""dupe the village"" scheme thought up by her father-in-law, and rousing cheers were heard at the battle scene at the end when she appeared. Somehow you knew it was going to happen, but it still made you feel good.The supporting cast is terrific as well, especially the actors playing Godfrey and King John. Mark Addy's part is way too small - he could get lots more laughs and lighten some of the heavy scenes (like the villagers being herded into the central building for retribution).All in all, I'd say it was well worth the ticket price, for the production values and scenery presented were outstanding. And by the way, did I mention Russell Crowe??",Robin Hood
548,enquiries-737-460052,"Disappointing, could have been so much better!",6,13 May 2010,"I went into this movie with an open mind, I find often that if you enter with anything more you are in for a fall!Although not entirely awful the film wasn't particularly inspiring and as previous reviews have stated you shouldn't expect the bog standard tale of robin hood and his merry men!The most irritating part of this film was perhaps the accent of crowe as hood. By the end of the movie I believe he is meant to have a broad Yorkshire style accent, however in parts he phases between Ringo Starr and a generic irish accent, later on he finds his feet and is able to give a more believable portrayal. I don't normally get too hung up on accents as they make no difference to the story. However when a characters accent changes during the movie it is difficult to focus on much else. I went with 3 other people who also were uninspired by the whole production. There were great part having the whole audience laughing, however it seemed to struggle when striking the balance between action drama and comedy.SUMMARY: I would maybe benefit from another watching, I enjoyed the action and the drama. The construction of the story was very good, however I simply could not get past the accent and this spoiled my movie experience!",Robin Hood
549,capt_chazmo19,quite average,3,13 May 2010,"Gosh this movie was terrible. It starts off fairly well but absolutely nose-dives after about the first 15 minutes, then he plot becomes really flighty and a tad hard to follow at times. You only ever get a superficial knowledge of the main characters. However, most of the scenery was great, it was interesting to see a 12th century version of London. I didn't really notice the score/ music.But the real problem with this version of Robin Hood was the title character. Russell Crowe was a pathetic, washed out version of Robin Hood. His accent was inconsistent and I didn't believe a word he said. The film may have be redeemable without him.I thought Cate Blanchett(Maid Marion) was particularly good. But I cringed every time poor Cate had an 'intimate' scene with Russell, there was no chemistry between them. I secretly hoped she would ditch him for Matthew MacFadyen(Sheriff of Nottingham), who had the only memorable line in the entire movie. Mark Strong(Godfrey) always makes a splendid villain and did not disappoint this time. Oscar Isaac was also good as the weedy King John.This movie inspired me to write my first review, its the only good thing that came of it. Don't waste your money.",Robin Hood
550,allattention,Horrible,1,14 May 2010,"This movie was worse than even Twilight! The trailer contains ALL of the action scenes from the movie, not the highlights; everything else is just slow, tedious buildup that makes me want to send the producers and script writers to a firing squad. The story and lines were as convincing as a Greek government budget report. I loved Gladiator which is why I thought this is worth the money, but now i regret the 2 hours of my life I'm never getting back. This movie is top pick for the razzies this year, they have my vote! I have no idea how the studio managed to fake all of the positive ratings here, but i bet as soon as more people see this the average will go south... Russel Crow and Ridley Scott are apparently in the business of milking previous success for a few lousy dollars. i would much rather see the porn version - Robin Wood, here i come.",Robin Hood
551,ckelstrup,Don't go,3,15 May 2010,"So you're wondering if you should go see this movie? I would recommend to go and watch Gladiator, Braveheart, Jean d'Arc, Saving Private Ryan or even another Robin Hood instead. The lack of originality in the scenery (landing crafts with ores anyone?) is appalling, although you will probably not care too much as the coherence in both the acting and storytelling is even worse. It is original in the storyline. Robin Hood is portrayed as a common son of a brick-maker, who is honest in games yet does not have a problem impersonate as a knight. Richard the Lionheart is a derailed military leader who is the reason for England's financial problems not the savior although he is still seen as such. Prince/King John is not only traditionally evil yet also modern and ""good"". Lady Marion is old and already married. Lots of changes of the original saga of Robin Hood and it could perhaps have been an interesting experience if it made sense, was believable or in any other way audience-involving. I was really bored by a movie that will quickly be forgotten.",Robin Hood

There were only 2 good things about this film and they were Cate Blanchet's acting and Scott Grimes' attempt at a welsh accent. The rest of the film was pretty poor. It was far too lengthly, took ages to get going and then when you finally thought well here we go - nothing happened. Don't get me wrong the scenery and costumes were excellent (being welsh it's always nice to see your own coastline!!!) but the script, storyline and the majority of the acting was just wrong.... I'm sure you could find something more productive to do in the 2hrs 30mins - feels more like 3 days - than to waste your money going to see this tripe.",Robin Hood

His ability to depict alternate places and times, and make entertaining action films not devoid of intellectual content is refreshing. With Robin Hood something went terribly wrong. The movie appears at first be going into the backside of the legend. Recall Richard comes back to England, and then promptly goes on another Crusade from which he doesn't come back (with zany consequences....Magna Carta). From the point at which Richard is killed, the plot falls apart. The only thing I can think is that because of the high dollar talent something happened with the studio. The fact that the storyboard images shown during the credits contain content not contain in the film itself might be a clue. The whole film gives one the feel of having been painted into a corner.",Robin Hood

I have to admit that I was not aware that this version of Robin Hood was an intro to the legend (didn't see any previews), I was waiting for the well known storyline to unfold, in frustration. Maybe if I watched it knowing that the arrow was not going to be splitting an arrow (a scene I was looking forward to in Ridley's interpretation), I might have enjoyed the novelty of it.I am trying to say something positive about RH, I truly am.

All trees were hand hewed and would have left sizable and irregular stumps.War Hammers like the one used by Robin in the beach battle were not introduced until the 14th and 15th centuries to defeat plate armor. They would not have been used in the 11th, when mail and helm were the apex of protection.Minor things but they undercut the otherwise good historical authenticity.",Robin Hood

Been reading A lot of these very lengthy reviews about this film..wow they're long and dull.. This film is without a doubt one of the best I've seen in a long time and as a HUGE Russell Crowe fan it was wonderful to see him in the role of Robin Hood, being all manly and sexy again...sigh. Love the scene where lady Marion has to help him off with his chain mail and we ladies get that much needed look at Russell bare chested..sigh and Cate Blanchett was the perfect choice for Lady Marion, what chemistry between them as well.. Overall I thought this film was a breath of fresh air, finally a more or less historically correct tale of events in England during very hard times in the 12th century. It stars a brilliant Kiwi born actor who can do the accent properly alongside a cast of extremely talented people... bar Prince John..did not convince me in that role and I kept thinking of Edmund Blackadder.. Rowan Atkinson would have been a better choice for the role.Fantastic film, can't wait to own it on DVD and watch it numerous times!! Well done Ridley/Russell!!",Robin Hood

I was expecting another Gladiator epic film, but this was not the case. The plot jumped around quite a bit and story lines were dragged out way too long. I was ready for the movie to end at anytime in the last 30 minutes. The battle scenes are great, but the Lady Merian story line does not fit well into the story, and who can forget about the Sheriff of Nottingham, Ridley Scott can! Don't expect to see a classic Robin Hood tale of helping the poor and stealing from the rich. This movie would be a classic ""renter"", don't waste your money seeing it in the theaters.",Robin Hood
558,deedeevolpe,The Legend rewritten to fit Star's Ego,1,18 May 2010,"Robin Hood was an Outlaw in England. The idea that Robin Hood followed King Richard in the Crusades is from the Sean Connery movie ""Robin and Marion"". Robin and Marion was made in the cynical 1970's. Robin and Marion is not a movie that gets watched a lot (I wouldn't sit through it again) and it's theme didn't need to get expanded in to a two hour epic. The traditional Robin Hood takes place in England for it is the story of the British People Saxon's vs the Norman occupiers. Green is the symbolic color of the native people of Briton (e.g. Gawain and the Green Knight). The traditional Robin Hood of legend wore green for he is part of the pagan history of Briton, not some cynical inner city trendy who wears black. There is this idea that people in the past wore depressing clothing and were dirty all the time. Yet if you look at the paintings from the time of King Richard the first you will find that people wore bright colors. Only bums dress badly in any age.If Christian Bale, Cary Elwes, Jeremy Irons, Johnny Depp, Robert Downey Jr. or Kevin Kline had played the part of Robin Hood we could have expected a more extensive range of emotions and with a better English accent. But Crowe has a limited range of emotions. Emotionally Crowe only does the self-serving stuff very well, you know; angry, self pity, prolonged contempt etc. Crowe is also very good at being ""intense"" which accounts for his screen presents and is often mistaken for acting ability. But the emotions required to do ""The Merry Adventures of Robin Hood"" are way, way beyond him. Being jovial, generous, good natured, romantic or even nice are outside his ability.In the Errol Flynn version, Robin Hood is bested by Little John and comes up laughing at himself at having been beaten by another man. This sort of self-demeaning humor and good will are way off the chart for Crowe. Crowe doesn't do humble. The character of Robin Hood had to be retooled to be more like the Gladiator so that Crowe could play the part. So Robin Hood the cunning fox had to be changed to become Robin Longstrides the bossy grumpy bear.Crowe can't do love or Romance very well. In Gladiator they had to cut love scenes out of the script. Crowe can only really do 'intense needy love' or 'self-pity mercy love' but not Romantic Love. To make matters worse Crowe hasn't held onto his youthful good looks in the ten years he's been a star he's really aged badly. Tom Cruse has been a star for almost 30 years still has his looks. As does Brad Pitt. Kevin Beacon who has been in the business for almost 35 years still has his looks. But because Crowe has let himself go so badly the part of Maid Marion had to be drastically retooled as well. The first Maid Marion Sienna Miller was fired from the movie because she looked too young and thin next to the aging and hefty Crowe.The movie was shut down for two months and the part of Maid Marion was changed and rewritten to that of an older woman. Maid Marion became the Widow Marion (Cate Blanchett) and the romance became a marriage of convenience. Crowe can't do romance. Gone are the scenes where Errol Flynn and Olivia De Havillandand flirted playfully on screen. The unromantic Crowe doesn't flirt well and can't woo. His on screen romances have always been rewritten around this so that the woman does most of the work while he looks angry, confused and full of self-pity. In this case Crowe's Robin Hood doesn't really like Marion (anger) he's just doing a friend a favor by sharing her bed. It's hard to believe that Robin Hood spent 10 years in the army with surrounded by men and isn't attacked to Marion. But Crowe can't play ""attracted"" there's no self pity in it.",Robin Hood
559,haroldgarlick,The director and writer owe an apology for insulting our intelligence,2,18 May 2010,"SPOILER ALERT FOR THE MOVIE ROBIN HOOD!!! We saw Robin Hood yesterday. The History teacher in me cringed at the drastic rewrite of History, My wife fumed at the mixing of stories and legends, the WW2 LST landing craft used by the 12th century french invading army 900 years off, 16 years off on the Magna Carta, The military tactics were all wrong for the era My costume designer daughter informed me that the dresses worn by Maid Marian varied mostly by 300 to 700 years off.

560,willems-mick,"Robin Hood differently, but better?",6,20 May 2010,"Probably like 90% of the readers I have seen Gladiator, Robin hood - prince of thieves, or even older series like ""Robin of Sherwood"", from 1984, which I used to admire like a kid in a candy store.I adore Gladiator and the series above; prince of thieves is a great popcorn movie.This Robin Hood gives a different view on this character, which is fine. I believe however it could have been a better movie if they wouldn't have chosen Russel Crowe, or even Ridley Scott. In this case it's like : you can't put Al Bundy and Peggy together in a different TV series and try to convince the audience they are not watching 'Married with Children'. Thats the best way I think to explain disappointed of people. When Crowe was 'leading an army' in the movie, being directed by Scott , you would see gladiator-alike scenes all the time...damn...The film is long, but not boring. Professional directorship, but with serious content flaws (see other reviewers). It balances between trying to be historically correct, and following the myth and comic books. They could have changed the content of 30 minutes, without anyone who was watching really bothering (dont pull that trick in gladiator)I missed humor in it, the little winks that are in all 8/10 movies, and make you occasionally laugh in your lazy seat. I try to conclude for most people: OK movie, gladiator fans will be pleased, robin hood fans will be slightly disappointed, Scott/Crowe adepts will like it. Not good enough to end up in my DVD collection, and I guess the word of mouth (""hey, watch this good movie"") will not be very loud.Guess it will be a good 6,5 on average. Sure better than a 6, not good enough for a steady 7. Robin hood will more likely remembered as Kevin Costner than Russel Crowe will. Hope it helps people.",Robin Hood

What's the group those guys are fighting with?"" Ridely Scott must have watched ""Bourne Supremacy"" and got the idea that shaking the camera while zooming in 2 inches from the actors nose was a great filming technique. Oh MAN, that was so ANNOYING.And what was with that terrible digital editing software???

But it wasn't. Why? Because it wasn't Robin Hood and thats what we went to go and watch. Yes it was Robin but it was Robin Longstride, it is a prequel and its only in the last few moments of the film that you see the classic film come together. Predictable in parts and slow it could've been better. It is not the worst film, with some great performances by Cate Blanchett and Russell Crowe and some gladiator style fight scenes it was overall an average film, but worth a watch.Please note that this Robin Hood movie is different to the other Robin Hood movies so don't walk in expecting that as you will be upset.

563,massaf1,Crowe and Scott do it again!,10,24 May 2010,"""On my way to see Ridley Scott's ""Robin Hood"", I couldn't help but wonder if I had set my expectations so high that it would be impossible for the movie to reach them. After all, this is Ridley Scott and Russell Crowe, the same team who brought us ""Gladiator"" which happens to be one of my all-time favorite films. Could they even come close to matching the strength of their previous Oscar winning period film. The answer is yes, they did come close.While overall ""Robin Hood"" isn't as accomplished as ""Gladiator"", it still does well in the same areas that made ""Gladiator"" such a strong film. When it comes to making an epic period film few can do it better than Ridley Scott. His amazing attention to detail, extravagant set pieces, and gorgeous cinematography create a believable and immersive 13th century England. From the film's opening sequences to it's incredible finish, the realistic feel and old English atmosphere is done to perfection. Scott also creates some fast-paced, frenzied action sequences. The frantic, gritty camera work and well executed CGI makes the small battles and huge epic scale war sequences feel real and intense.The film also is strenghtened by the incredible performance of Russell Crowe. Few actors can command the screen like Crowe. He has a presence on film that not only brings strength to his characters but also a genuine humanity. Crowe's Robin Hood is possibly the most human of any of the previous portrayals showing a sad but strong man in the dark about his past and uncertain about his future. Mark Strong gives another great ""bad guy"" performance and is truly menacing and despicable. Cate Blanchett creates a very different and intriguing Marion while Max von Sydow and William Hurt also give great supporting performances.""Robin Hood"" is an entirely different look at the classic character. It's a prequel that sets itself up for possibly more films. It's incredibly well made with high production value. It's a well written story that may start off slow for some but is actually smart and intelligent and builds itself up to an exciting climax. A great film that shows why Crowe and Scott are one of Hollywood's best combinations.""",Robin Hood
564,mrcamiller,Solid but Lacking,7,25 May 2010,"There is a generation of young men and women for whom Robin Hood is synonymous with a cartoon fox and Little John who looks suspiciously like Baloo the Bear. That image of Robin Hood was corrupted in the early '90s with the unfortunate Kevin Costner film, but the story remained the same: Robin Hood was the leader of a band of outlaws fighting against the tyranny and oppression of a corrupt government on behalf of those who could not fight for themselves.I just returned from seeing Ridley Scott's Robin Hood and I must say that it did not deliver the goods. On a purely cinematic level, the film was quite enjoyable. Beautifully filmed and well acted, I found myself engaged in the movie and enjoying the experience. The film, however, left little impression other than aesthetics.Robin Hood begins with a few lines written in an old manuscript, presumably to set up the story: in times of oppression and tyranny, men rise up to fight for justice and are called ""outlaws"". Fair enough and straight forwardly revealing that the power and meaning of the film will be found in the plot, how men rise up from obscurity and weakness to fight for justice. But then, the film doesn't do that, it doesn't do what the first 10 seconds established it would do. Instead of telling the story of Robin Hood, it tells the back-story of Robin Hood, how Robin Longstrides becomes Robin Hood. And in that telling, rather than fight against the oppression and tyranny of the petulant King John, Robin actually finds himself fighting with King John against the French and Godfrey, the English traitor. Really, I found the film to be a better portrayal of unity against common enemies than of the weak rising up against the strong. Ultimately, it is only at the end of the film, after King John backpedaled from an agreement, that Robin is proclaimed an outlaw.I have to say that Ridley Scott seems to be getting a bit cliché with his period pieces. ""Gladiator"", ""Kingdom of Heaven"", and ""Robin Hood"" all deal with the various themes fatherhood, justice, oppression, and heroes found in obscure places to stand up against the powerful. As much as I enjoy Scott's films, I have to say that they are beginning to get a little predictable, with the ""hero"" often simply repeated: insert Maximus for Balian for Robin Hood and you would have much the same film.The parts are acted well, but few of the characters are given any real depth. Max Von Sydow as Sir Walter Loxley and Mark Addy as Friar Tuck are the high points; admittedly, they seem to have been given the best bits by the screen-writer. Cate Blanchett does well as Marian, and Russell Crowe seemed to be uninspired. He seems to have carved out a niche of portraying the hero, victimized and yet willing to right the wrongs. For any Robin Hood film to ""work"", Robin Hood's inner drive for justice and freedom must come through in the writing and in the performance. In this most recent version, this inner drive was absent. In the end, it's not the acting or directing so much as it is the writing that hampers this film.Enough with the critique, I just realized I need to say something good. The action scenes were well done, plenty of medieval violence and yet, realistic without being over the top. The chemistry between Blanchett and Crowe seemed natural and honest. All in all, I would have to say that this was an enjoyable film, but is hampered by the simple fact that too many of us know too much about Robin Hood. Crowe's version won't make me forget the cartoon, but he just might make me forget Kevin Costner.",Robin Hood
565,jubith85,totally disappointed,4,25 May 2010,"When directing a movie about Robin Hood, they should understand the expectations from the people on such a massive character. Here I don't mean that I wanted a load of fight sequences.They should have avoided such a lag in the movie. Midway down the movie I see no aim in character neither any anticipation in the audience. There were a bunch of unimportant scenes. They could have been better utilized for creating a depth in the character. Neither a heavy load of fight scenes nor a drag in movie is ever going to be in the heart of any audience anymore.Such a long movie with a heavy drag over the subject. The director just gave enough content for a new spoof movie to be launched! The crew and acting is outstanding. Just that the screen play simply sucked.",Robin Hood

Anyway, he must have read my mind cos in a following scene he exposed his torso. Well, I can understand that the director must've convinced him to get into shape for fear that audiences may confuse his character with that of Frair Tuck.Now that I've got all the bitchiness out of my system, down to the serious stuff. I have to disagree with the previous reviewer cos I thoroughly enjoyed the movie. Kudos for screenplay, production design and cinematography. There was a sense of authenticity that I found lacking in the Kevin Costner project in the '90s. There was a lot of small important details that was refreshing. Outdoor shots especially the battle scenes were impressive.Found the whole cast were wonderful especially Ms Blancett.Some of the dialog was really witty for example Marian's response to Robin's comment of 'good knight'.",Robin Hood

And it is Ridley Scott, – who created ""Gladiator"", ""Kingdom, of Heaven"" and ""Robin Hood"" – who leads this group. It is exactly the ""Gladiator"" that is considered to be the movie that brought the sympathies of the mass audience to the historical movie genre – the one that lost it since the times of ""Ben-Hur"" and ""Cleopatra"". Not the least of the factors is that in the 80s Ridley Scott with his ""Blade-Runner"" and ""Alien"" quadrilogy also headed the group of directors who were the best at shooting the films about the future.

568,jingram05,Much better than most critical reviews,9,30 May 2010,"I saw this movie in a sold-out theater two weeks after the movie opened, which says something about the stock people are taking of the reviews. Indeed, this picture is way better than I expected, based on the underwhelming reviews I had seen prior to the showing.It is a little dark, yes, but there are moments of levity. But I think the mood captured in this film pretty much sums up 12th century England and France as the third crusade winds down. Let's see, England's King Richard the Lion Heart is killed, his younger putz of a brother John takes the helm, and France's Philip attempts to exploit the vacuous state of affairs following King Richard's demise.I also like the cast, and the script. Again, yes, liberties were taken with the historical context, but is that not Hollywood? And with the re-telling of the Robbin Hood story following the classic Errol Flynn and the appallingly bad Kevin Costner numbers, can we not appreciate a different approach? I think it has a wonderful Ridley Scott look and feel, just like it should, and I for one came away entertained. The older gentleman and his wife to my left at the showing appeared to be every bit as enthralled as I was. I couldn't help but ask at the end if they thought it was lousy, just as our reviewers have almost categorically stated. They looked at me as if I were from another planet, and both said they loved it.Why would you go to a film if you know beforehand you are not going to like it? Why would you expect a serious remake to be ""Men In Tights""? I loved this film, and can't wait for both the DVD and the sequel that ought to be forthcoming.

570,faysky,What a miserable load of critics you all are,10,31 May 2010,"I have seen just about every film ever made of Robin Hood and this one was by far the best ever. Not only was it far more realistic of the time, it had reasons and ongoing themes that hopefully will lead to at least two more. The fore-runner of the Magna Carta was brilliant...It has always puzzled me how a little scroat like John Landless (King John)ever got involved in something honourable but this could be played out well. The 'French Pastry' in his bed was actually a 13 year old at the time! In our local there is a church that was re-built in the 12th century and it's not hard to imagine the community at that time being very similar to the Nottingham created in this movie. In fact there are one or two buildings that are still in use of the same structure...all rural and bucolic...as to Marion being a wimp unable to hurl a sword some townies need to get out more...our local women mend tractors and trailers and herd great beasts into barns with a whistle. This was for me a real English film with guts...I don't care about the accuracies of the French invasion...there are many things in this film that are correct historically and with far more interesting bits of history than most of the other films. As to the complaint that the White Horse is in the wrong place again who cares...there were loads of pagan carvings in chalk back then.The main thing to remember about Robin Hood is that he was in fact a real person...albeit a composite of many who stood up to the scoundrels who pillaged every hard working household in the land, turning the English into slaves killing themselves to pay taxes to keep the rich in luxury....things don't change much and this country is full of such slaves still...Hopefully the Robin Hood spirit is still alive somewhere and the idyllic life in the greenwood with plenty to eat and drink and to sing about, without the worry of taxes and mortgages and bailiffs and stuff is not yet totally dead.Com'on guys its a MOVIE! and a bloody good one. Thanks Russel and Ridley and Cate and everyone involved...I will be watching the DVD regularly so I can see all the little nuances I missed.Chris",Robin Hood

572,rutgerbgm,So much potential but a complete failure,4,31 May 2010,"I had high expectations of this movie but after one hour I wandered to myself, what just happened? A friend asked me what the hell was going on and the answer was actually nothing, kings dead, french spy trying to stir things up and robin is of delivering a sword... one and a half hour of movie and this is what happened! Things just kepped getting worse and it was a downhill ride from the moment the movie started ( seriously, richard lionheart riding in front off the gates of a castle under siege? no wonder he got shot ) The love story concerning marion is terrible... no build up just an easy ride in from the moment they meet. The jokes are terrible but that is probably because I was already annoyed of the terrible story and horrible character development. The most terrible thing is the final act of the movie, our great hero rides off with the words to his beloved Marian, I love you! and then he rides away. I could not prevent a gasp of disbelieve escaping my mouth and according to the reaction of the other theater visitors, they felt my pain. So the north and south needed to unite in order to defeat the french who were about to set foot on English soil. With a great speech the English ride united to the beach to fight the English that are arriving in row boats? big ass row boats? so they rowed all the way from France? anyway the archers start shooting down arrows from the cliff and the most horrific strategic decision is made to attack the french straight on. Why? the french are getting peppered by arrows, why attack them melee style? anyhow, the united English army consists of probable 200 horsemen, thats it.... so the battle of the south and north would have been a battle of 100 vs 100 men. Terrible!!!! Then marion shows up and robin ( russel ) says that she should take care of her own part of the army, which are 10 KIDS on PONY'S. The battle is terrible, for example; robin starts frenching with marion in the water... I litterly thought to myself I have to get my money back...Terrible story and an unreal feel of the final battle, you probably should watch this and make your own conclusions, but seriously rent the movie and save the money from the theater....",Robin Hood
573,Jonbiriani,Disappointing,3,2 June 2010,"I must admit, I was encouraged at the start of this film by the interpretation of Richard the Lionheart as a tired and brutal warlord who had ruined his country, and thought for a moment that Ridley Scott was going to pull off a triumph in being able to set a great action film in an interesting and reliable historical context. Alas, he managed to do neither.The pace of the film is generally slow, and key parts of the plot seem rushed and cobbled together. Mark Strong does his best as the film's villain 'Godfrey', but the script does nothing to explore his character or motives for his treason. Russell Crow is similarly one dimensional as Robin Longstride, partly due to the limitations of the script, although I couldn't help thinking that Sean Bean was made for the role of 'Barnsdale lad turned noble hero' and would have done a far better job. The development of the central love story between Marion and Robin is unconvincing, as is the development of the bond between Robin and his associates. The lack of a coherent plot at any level is summed up in the final battle scene in which the entire cast converge together with little explanation of how and why they got there. Its almost as if the writers got bored halfway through writing the script and wrote the entire second half of the film on the back of a fag packet.One of the great advantages of using the Robin Hood legends as a film setting is that the stories themselves are timeless, and have changed and developed over many centuries. Action can be set loosely around the events of the 12-14th century, without paying too much heed to what really happened. As such, Robin Hood Prince of Thieves is a great romantic action film set loosely in medieval England, and the result was a great success, despite Kevin Costner's American accent. In this version of the story Ridley Scott seems to attempt a confusing History lesson, inserting characters like William Marshall, Isobella de Angeouleme and Eleanor of Aquitane, and giving the Barons Revolt and Magna Carta a central role, but never really explaining who or what these people and events were. This disrupts the potential for a decent story and become confusing as the film gets bogged down in pseudo historical narrative, which in the end is mostly hugely distorted to try to forge some of a plot. Worse still the attempts at factual accuracy are not supported by convincing detail, and the setting of the late 12th century never quite seems plausible. A example of this is the presentation of Nottingham as a 'hobbit village' and the arrival of French invaders (who in reality never materialised) in what appear to be Second World War landing craft. This would matter far less if the film did not aspire to be Historically accurate from the outset, but by alluding to so many real events and personalities it quickly gets diverted by having to present some kind of Historical narrative. Far more successful was John Irvin's 1991 film 'Robin Hood' which uses subtle allusions to the time, such as the French accents of the noblemen, to convincing effect whilst not being weighed down by the need to portray specific historical events.Sadly the final result of this particular telling of the Robin Hood legend is a slow moving and disjointed film that will please neither the purists nor the regular movie goers, largely because it tries to do both.",Robin Hood

Just watch one of the many other Robin Hood related movies or TV shows instead of this trash.I've been a fan of Robin Hood since I was a kid and I've seen most if not all of the movies and TV shows and been too many of the Robin Hood attractions such as Sherwood Forest etc, so you can probably say that I know a bit about R.H and I've never heard of Robin Longstride (Note: The name ""Robin Longstride"" appears to be unique to the 2010 Robin Hood film starring Russell Crowe. However, Robin Hood has been depicted as a former Crusader in several versions, perhaps most notably in the 1976 film Robin and Marian. *from the bold outlaw website*) it's pretty bad that they just made up some random family friendly R.H story for a movie when there are plenty of great ones already that are a million times better than this, go and check out Robin Hood Prince of Thieves before you rate this more than 5. It's so bad that it looks like they had a smaller budget than the BBC TV show of the same name.The acting in this isn't really that convincing as none of the characters playing English folk came across as very English apart from Mark Addy who played Friar Tuck whom is British; plus some of the actors weren't very well cast, Russel Crow as Robin Hood is a joke. The music wasn't very accurate for the time period although I'm not sure when Celtic folk music began, but what I do know was 700 years ago here in England Robin Hood and his merry men weren't playing it.

However, this movie's original story and message displays a strong moral compass that is relevant for our time.From the beginning it is a story about human rights and the equality of all mankind. Roles are examined from the King of England to the lowliest peasant, and the issues discussed hint at the origins of the Magna Carta and the Bill of Rights in the U.S. Constitution.Russel Crowe's Robin Hood is an admirable character with a strong sense of justice and duty.

I am a big Ridley Scott fan but I felt like he just kicked me in the privates. Here's the play by play of the ""Okay I am going to leave ... no I give it another chance."" I said it about 8 times during the film.When the opening words flashed on parchment ""In times like these (or something) the outlaw becomes the hero (or something)"" I thought Zoro...it's a Zoro movie. I whispered to my wife ""oh my God I hope this is going to be good."" I had an aching feeling.Interesting historical references were the only thing that kept me in the seat for 2.5+ hours. The opening scenes of Richard's Army in France, the reference to that Massacre at Acre, the arrow through Richard's neck (though this did not happen on the way back from the Crusades), the references to the Magna Carta were places where my mind went okay what the heck are they doing with all this!! The ""oh hell, let's go"" scenes: - Robin steps in the road in front of the Corn column and says ""None shall pass..."" Thought it was going to be a Monty Python scene with Arthur hacking up the black knight.The first Marion scene, my wife said: ""What is this supposed to be. The Lost Boys?!"" - Dancing to modern Irish Music.The removal of the chain mail. Come on!

577,schroederben-758-760102,Get a grip folks---this was a fantastic film about a LEGEND,10,6 June 2010,"It strikes me as odd that a film about a mythical hero during medieval England is being lambasted for failing in the historical accuracy department. The fact is, Robin Hood is a legend, and all legends thrive on both re-interpretation of the story as well as taking liberties with actual history. If you are disappointed because Robin Hood didn't have a feather in his cap, or didn't shoot his bow enough, or prance around the forest in tights, then you are most likely proceeding from the erroneous presumption that the tale of Robin Hood is either a static, fixed story or actual history itself when it is neither. Like the Arthurian Legend, it is a tale that is told and retold, reflecting the prevailing social, political, or religious thought of contemporary times.Historical inaccuracies? Of course! That's what makes it a movie and not a History Channel documentary. But nonetheless, the film does do justice to the spirit of the times. The antagonism between the Barons and King John ultimately leading up to Magna Carta, which we will presumably see in future sequels, is quite well done. (And no, the Magna Carta was not a bill of rights for all Englishman, but an attempted codification of the existing feudal contract between the lords and the king, but WHO CARES?) The film brilliantly places Robin Hood in the middle of the multi-layered political conflict that characterized 12th century England, and this is its true genius, along with Scott's fantastic directing. Names and dates wrong? Some costumes inappropriate for the time period? A few accents out of place? Certainly. If this bothers you to the point of seeing red, I advise you to read the Oxford Medieval History, though don't expect to be thrilled enough to want to scarf down popcorn, soda, and candy in the process.Perhaps the failure to suspend disbelief or immerse ourselves in historical-based fantasy is a product of the increased production values of modern films, the (overly heavy) reliance of special effects, CGI, and attempts to portray a grittier version of history and historical legend. These things may lead us to expect more in the department of realism than films should rightfully offer. For myself, I am thankful that Scott and company have not lost sight of film as a medium to explore, to inspire, and to generate interest in history.",Robin Hood
578,ajakubow,Robin Hood fizzes,3,9 June 2010,"I went to Robin Hood with great expectations - two of my favourite actors, a great director and a lot of buzz. Something went very wrong with this movie, somewhere between the idea and the script. The double persona of Robert Loxley/Robin Hood, two different people gradually merging into a composite fantasy, is a great idea, but it is hard to realise on the screen, as the director Ridley Scott demonstrated. Our Robin Hood, the son of a stonemason ""thrown into the world of men"" at the age of six when his father is murdered as a Marxist agitator, emerges as a literate and sophisticated ideologue (something genetic no doubt) with a penchant for erudite rhetoric and political philosophy. Maid Marian rapidly turns out not be a maid at all, having been enjoying short but sweet (k)nights with Loxley for the week between their wedding and his departure for the wars/crusades. She's also apparently capable of bending, stringing and loosing a longbow while barely raising a sweat. The film is full of anachronisms, with early Saxon churches suddenly being praised as Norman innovations, and a landing at Dover looking more like an out-take from D-Day. The pacing is discordant, and the acting generally woeful,a s though the actors cannot believe anyone could write such lines - most of the time they camp it up with little regard for anything but their splendid armoured appearances. When Von Sydow, the blind earl of Loxley, complains that Robin smells and should have a bath, I thought we were in cloud cuckoo land; everyone smelt and no one washed regularly, with the upper classes dousing themselves with scents or pomades. All in all, a waste of talent, capacity and film stock.",Robin Hood

This was quite surprising, so I continued to watch, expecting it to be introduced soon, but sadly it wasn't. Leaving me until the end of the film disappointed as the story that has kept us hooked through out the years faded to the words ""And now the story begins"" and the film ended. The acting in the film was great, showing the loyalty yet wildness of Robin and he so called ""Merry Men"". A Favorite of mine was the role of Marion Loxley, played by Cate Blanchett, as The rest of the movie, the character was not the stereotypical beautiful and elegant woman we see all the time, but a rough survivor who would protect her family and the villagers at all times. Overall a disappointing film That I score a 2 and that I wouldn't really recommend..",Robin Hood
580,tim_ramage,A bit of a dogs dinner,3,21 June 2010,"Very rarely do I walk out of films but I did with this one - at about 2 hours. I really gave up. What the hell was going on? Was it an editing problem, was the script just too complex/convoluted/poor, was it an action film or a 12C political thriller or Dickensian drama, where the hell was Robin Hood (that we all know and love)? This was an overly complex, disjointed, poorly edited, unbelievable, often laughably ridiculous plot & storyline,(or jumping) mi sh mash. Totally not what I was expecting from this director and lead actor. It had all the right ingredients - great scenery, good acting, good cinematography. Just a terrible storyline, bad take on the Robin Hood thing and 40 mins too long.",Robin Hood

Upon reading some of the most critical comments regarding the movies historical ""facts"" being incorrect I have to chuckle. IF anyone wanted or was expecting an accurate, factual historical, they should have bought a a book or watched a PBS documentary.This movie is strictly about entertainment and IMHO it succeeded beyond my expectations. Especially the message - which MANY seemed to have missed the point of....about terrible hardships people endured be it onerous taxation, horrific mass scale torture, lack of civil and social rights, starvation, etc. People seemed to be more preoccupied with critique of picking apart the minutia - the small incorrect details about archers bows, boat configurations and accents. And yet, they sit daily in front of their TV mesmerized and tolerate the most ABSURD unrealistic, bizarre TV commercials depicting geckos selling insurance, housewives dancing with vacuum cleaners, really really dumb reality TV shows, and adult cartoons...thinking how...cute and entertaining?Russell Crowe as usual - delivers. Leaving this movie I was reminded of how absolutely lucky I am to be alive today to enjoy what prosperity and freedoms people who lived in England back when...could not even imagine possible. Now back to regular TV programing and factual reality. lol",Robin Hood
582,ollietheth,Crowe and Scott combination? Was expecting so much more...,4,28 January 2012,"Why does Crowe think he's gods gift to acting when he can't even hold a correct accent for more than 40 minutes at a time. Why did Scott agree to produce a film that had Maid Marion lead an army of children against the French on a beach?? I find it easier to believe that Morgan Freeman was Kevin Costners side kick in the 90's than Cate Blanchett's woolly attempts to chum up with Crowe. I've loved every Robin Hood film to come before this, even the Disney version with the fox and merry animals, so I paid good money to see this in the cinema, but the overall effect was somewhat diluted when I consider the value of this film in terms of the story it attempted to depict.Disappointed.",Robin Hood
583,cogito_ergo_cogitum,It was not Robin Hood.,3,12 May 2010,"This film was an ignorant and arrogant waste of my time. I'll admit, I was excited. I thought that the Scott/Crowe team could have been ideal for the classic human and heroic epic. They were not. Every aspect that has made Robin Hood and enduring and popular tale was ignored. Gone was any of the struggle, morality and humanity present in both Robin Hood and Gladiator. Gone were the relationships with supporting roles, replaced by cookie cutter sidekicks, pantomime bad guys and a shallow, badly portrayed love interest. From a rich seam of material they could have used, they picked out some names, shoved them into a tale that had nothing to do with them and called it a movie. It would be like a gold miner pointing to a dung heap and calling it gold to cash in on the word 'gold'. As a generic fantasy action flick it had two times where I thought ""Bob"" (I shall not call the movie Robin Hood) was either well acted or well choreographed. As a retelling of an enduring legend it was mediocre and has inspired me to write my first IMDb review. As soon as it started to tell the tale of Robin Hood it faded to black.",Robin Hood
584,massafelipe2,Great Narration !!,8,7 September 2010,This Movie is very intelligently made.Ridley Scott has time and again proved himself a great narrator.This movie is fast paced and action is very engrossing.Romance is subtle enough to make you wait for the sequences between Robin and Marion. One character that i found really strong is that of Walter loxley.It is really well acted and with a touch of serenity that an old man radiates. Story has good twists and war sequences. Screenplay and locations are awesome.You can remember the film long after watching it and you come out satisfied with your time well spent. Obviously there are cynics of this genre of timepieces so the reviews might vary slightly depending upon the personal interests.,Robin Hood

First off, Eleanor of Aquitaine (The Queen mother) was French and her family owned a very large portion of France (which is why the King of England wanted to marry her). Second, it wasn't a matter of a few days for coming back from the Holy Land/Crusades but rather years. So, within the first 15 minutes of this film starting, I just stopped caring. Numerous other issues with the Magna Carta, which have been pointed out before.If you want to watch a movie that is long, slightly drawn out with casting done for big names and a big action scene at the end, this is your film.",Robin Hood

TERRIBLE.Outside of Russel Crowe being completely full of himself, there are only two things that redeem this movie.1) The social commentary of the time - though that's portrayed correctly in every version of the movie.2) Cate Blanchett.King Richard the Lion Heart did NOT die in battle.Robin did NOT get his name from some random knight who was dying.Robin did NOT create the band of merry men and did NOT know little John right off the bat.Maid Marion was NOT married to Robin of Loxley.I could go on and on about this ...",Robin Hood

Over half of the movie we are led to believe we are watching ""plot"" but it has no bearing on the final outcome of the movie.The fighting scenes were decent, except for the disaster of the finale.

What I didn't realize, and I don't think it was pushed as such, is that it is the story of how Robin Hood came to be.If you are looking for a movie showing Robin Hood robbing the rich, giving to the poor, all the while confounding the sheriff, then this is going to disappoint you. Watch the Disney cartoon instead.This movie is a pleasure for the medieval movie lovers. Great sets, great costumes and a great story.

589,erog001,Not enough kilts.,7,2 October 2010,"Robin Hood (2010), a film about a mythical English rebel filmed in Wales, directed by a Yorkshireman, acted by Australians, Americans, French, a Swede and one or two local actors has something missing in it's concoction. Mel Gibson in a kilt. I do not wish to criticize unfairly, this movie hits all the action-adventure buttons, is immensely enjoyable to watch, but it has a sizable flaw in an absence of authentic English character. The English are an immensely funny, fun loving and volatile people, independent thinkers who delight in naughtiness and who enjoy each other's company. Mel in a kilt would have made a far better Robin Hood than Russell Crowe in historically accurate chain mail. Mel drunk with a kilt worn on his head and his knees painted blue screaming insensible gibberish at a Russian would have been a far more convincing Robin Hood. It was like watching Belgians pretending to be Frenchmen, you know they're not French before they've even opened their mouths. That is how I felt about this film. People who do not like the English should not make movies about their history, mythical or otherwise.",Robin Hood
590,grahamjv-860-772884,Robin the Who?,1,2 October 2010,"Just seen 'Robin Hood'.... did the writers actually research the story and legend of Robin Hood? Is this just another American version of an English legend? Why does Russel Crowe keep changing his accent? Is it because he is a terrible actor, or because the writer really had no idea about England and where about Nottingham is? One of THE worst films i've ever seen; slow, boring and NOTHING to the legend. Marian was known as Maid Marian because she wasn't married, she was a maid, which means an un-married woman! Robin didn't steal the identity of someone else and live happily next door to the sheriff of Nottingham, who had a little mud house in the middle of a village. He lived in a castle and Nottingham was the town built up around it. Richard Lion Heart was not killed by a french chef who's just served up soup during a battle, and the French certainly did not battle Robin Hood, apparently now the leader of the English army, after landing in modern landing craft invented and used in World War 2!!! Who the hell write this rubbish!! Go back to directing Alien Films Mr Scott, because you are cr.... rubbish at historic English folklore.",Robin Hood
591,eljezovic,Scott's choice of great leading roles and his mix of quality intertextuality play a great part in making this movie an enjoyable one.,7,7 October 2010,"Director Scott Ridley almost never disappoints with his successful genre mix of war-drama-action-romance movies like Gladiator, Tristan & Isolde, Kingdom of Heaven and now Robin Hood. Unlike the classic Robin Hood tale, Scott's version tells a story of Robin Hood's beginnings. The success of this movie lies in part on the great acting of Gladiator's Oscar wining star, Russell Crowe.Scott's Robin Hood follows the life of a skilled archer from his early days in the army of King Richard, in which he fought against the French, through falling in love with Marian (Oscar winner Cate Blanchett), to standing up to the King, to the gathering of his gang who will take from greedy rich and donate to the poor.Given the great success of Scott's movies staring Russell Crowe, it is hard not to notice the similarities not only of movie genre but also intertextuality of some scene details from their previous work. This is especially evident when compared with Gladiator. For example, in both movies emphasis is shown on Crowe's receiving of a better sword. The better sword symbolises Crowe's transition into higher leadership roles. Also, both movies show how the bravery of Crowe's characters can bring an ordinary person to stand up to someone at the highest of positions (the King in Robin Hood and Cesar in Gladiator) and obtain necessary support from the people. No matter what you perceive Robin Hood to be, a thief or a hero, there is no doubt that he will be viewed as the eternal symbol of the struggle for freedom for all people.Scott's choice of great leading roles and his mix of quality intertextuality play a great part in making this movie an enjoyable one.",Robin Hood
592,derek-ehrns,"Solid ""B"" Film",6,13 December 2010,"The anticipation was high when ""Best Picture"" Gladiator's makers decided to collaborate once again for Robin Hood.Director Ridley Scott and lead writer Brian Helgeland set up the movie as an explanation of how Robin ""Longstrides"" became the ""Sherwood Forest's favorite outlaw"" character depicted in other stories, and the result is similar to Christopher Nolan's Batman Begins.The plot, however, is made sticky with complex politics between various government figures, and the viewer is left wondering how Robin Hood will ever fit into the big picture. He does in the end, but in a sort of slapdash way, and perhaps his involvement could be more solid with a simpler storyline.Russell Crowe, despite depicting a far more somber Robin Hood than is typical of the character, does not disappoint, and the casting jobs (particularly for Robin's three Merry Men) are solid.Robin Hood is certainly not at the same caliber as Gladiator, but still can stand on its own as a decent ""B"" movie.",Robin Hood

No thank you. Robin Hood's plot was just a big massacre with horrible lighting. I didn't expect much but this was worst even worse than I expected.

I love the myth of Robin Hood and ""the rob from the rich to give to the poor"" bases it is themed on, but this film never produces that it goes more into politics and war than Robin Hood the brave hero himself.Russell Crowe puts on about 8-10 different accents that are very recognisable and starts to make you withdraw from his character straight away and I basically think should not have been cast for this role it should have been a British actor so it stays one accent. But we could have all allowed the accent if the film would have had the thrill and spark it needed.There was no ""Rob from the rich give to the poor"" theme which basically killed this movie form the outset.I could go on forever and list all the things that let this movie down for me but I wont.

The movie vaguely explains what happened to robin hood as a child and how he becomes an outlaw later in life. Battle scenes are few and far between, however they are well directed and have some fantastic POV (point of view)arrow shots to look out for. Acting from Crowe/Blanchett etc is adequate, however bad accents are a letdown, frequently changing; one minute Irish,then English and back again. I found the story well written, with powerful scenes throughout, it really has set the foundations for a further couple of movies. I look forward to see, if and when the next instalment arrives and have high expectations of what it may bring.",Robin Hood
596,drisbr01,Total Insult to Moviegoers,1,6 September 2015,"This movie disregards any pretense to historicity or even believability, and instead chooses to wallow in bad special effects, shaky cam, phoned in ""acting"", and confusing and unsatisfying plot threads that were cliché when they were first used, yet somehow, never seem to go anywhere. The movie has no pacing--the action sequences come out of nowhere, they're so poorly edited that it's impossible to actually follow any of the action, and then they resolve and move on without any reason or motivation. The entire experience is like watching someone's high-school history report, if they had smoked weed and fallen asleep while watching the history channel; only that might actually be fun. This is just a train wreck--and not the good kind either, because it's just plain boring. Even the actors seem bored to death by the experience and none of them even tries to seem engaged. I would've hoped for more from the director of Kingdom of Heaven, but it felt like he just checked out and didn't care. This movie is a waste of your time. It's a waste of your mind. It's just a waste. And it's an insult to even offer it to an audience. Anyone involved with this offense should be ashamed.",Robin Hood
597,MeganFrankie,A Robbin' Hood That Could Have Been Worse,6,2 March 2011,"I have never liked Robin Hood movies. Robin Hood is just too slick and smug for his own good and the annoying thing is, he always wins. Methinks the much put-upon and hated Sheriff of Nottingham is a far more sexually attractive beast, though alas, directors never seem interested in harvesting such rich potential. This movie, though as barely credible as any of the others has nevertheless a strong cast right down to William Hurt as the kings military commander William Marshall and Max Von Sydow as Maid Marion's father in law. And truly, it is absolutely amazing how some reasonably good acting can salvage a rotten script, a melodramatic plot worn so thin that it's a wonder the actors keep a straight face, totally corny characterisation and military action that for all its faithful historical rendering seems to drag on inexplicably.The film echoes Gladiator - also a melodramatic farrago saved by the skin of its teeth by Russell Crowe's guttural, sub-woofing tiger growls. However this time Russell Crowe is up against a remarkably similar thoroughly bad evil psychopath - King John, who actually can spit quite a long way and looks suitably effete and deranged. Crowe is also most ably supported by Cate Blanchett's lovely, strong, reasonant contralto tones although the sexual chemistry seems a somewhat perfunctory adjunct to the main game, which is of course upholding the noble tradition of democracy for all decent normal non-psychopaths who are not in power. To this end even William Marshall and queen dowager Eleanor of Aquitaine are old pals colluding with Robin Hood - the only man with any mojo in the kingdom - to get the job done, which apparently towards the end includes fending off an invasion led by the King of France. Even the doughty Cate Blanchett's Maid Marion/Lady Loxley joins the fray for this one (as if she isn't busy enough tending to runaway orphan boys and defending her property from the sheriff), putting in a rousing few flails at Robin's arch enemy before languishing helpless in the surf while the hero and the bad guy thresh grunting about together in the shallows. Mind you, Robin Hood's real forte is his skill with a bow and arrow, as we soon see in a rousing finale which promises to be only the beginning...On the whole, this Robin Hood film takes itself too seriously which tends to make it more of a farce than the concept of Robin Hood inherently is. This earnest back-to-basics grittiness take seems to sap the film of its attempts at zest and high-spirited humour, which one would think would be the main point of watching Robin Hood at all. Still, some solidly good acting and able costuming saves a rather wan and worn out day.",Robin Hood

And because of the length you get the feel that the entire story has been told. This left me with a satisfying feeling that you don't get after watching some other movies.I gave it a 9/10.

It plods along with no direction or purpose at all. It could have been about any knight coming back from the crusades and adds nothing to the mythology of the story. I find it hard to understand Ridley Scott at times as he has created real classic films such as blade runner and alien. He has also made some other movies which I love- legend, American gangster, a good year and white squall. He has then made the totally overrated gladiator, GI Jane, body of lies and this. Seriously if you want an entertaining robin hood story then watch the Costner version or if you want a serious telling of the tale, seek out the never bettered robin of Sherwood TV series. Connery's robin and Marion is also a far better addition to the robin hood film canon than this boring, uninvolving tale. Very disappointing indeed.",Robin Hood

This one seems to be a more realistic take on the era and times of the legendary Robin Hood. Perhaps the people who did not like it did so because they have gotten used to the almost magical-surreal Middle Ages the previous Robin Hood movies portray in them, movies which often show a very romanticized setting, with less dirt and grind, when in reality the Middle Ages were brutal, dirty and hard. Russell and the cast did a great job in the film, and transported us into the story, making us forget we were looking at actors. The scenes had a good flow to them, and the story was well paced.

If this movie came out with a different title, it would've gained much more ratings. But many expect to see the Robin they know in this and end up in disappointment. From the start of the movie to the end, it was perfect. Well directed and well acted out. From the wasted king to the hero with a bow, everyone acted perfectly.

Mark Strong gives a reasonable performance as the villain I suppose, but his character is never given any chance of nuance, so remains an fairly generic ""badguy"". There are some big, sweeping battle scenes but nothing much to get excited about.

If it must be done, shed light on the darkest sight. Even though the storyline's correlate with each other. They both acknowledge the cultural mural of hope. That conveys a message to present day. That Men & women are stronger as one. The fear that still pauses a revision of the world is MAN profiled in a deductive fashion showing the decisions men make are more likely than not to be at the end of a gun barrel. Were if man was to swallow his pride and insecurities to join forces with the powerful women in our country. Maybe, just maybe world round peace though smirked upon; could be a reality.

The film starts off well enough and it never drags but as another critic noted it is all to predictable.It played out like a James Bond film. You knew more or less what was going to happen. At times the film appeared to have been edited rather sloppily. Characters are not given time to develop - and you sort of wonder why they were given any screen time what so ever, as their point was unnecessary given you rarely or don't see them again. I would reckon that the extended edition would clear a lot of this up? I would imagine the end battle looks quite impressive to most viewers but its actually not done very well and at a couple of points i thought was rather silly. A few decisions here were rather questionable.I seemed to get the impression that the film wanted to win over a younger audience. Yes there is blood, but there are no limbs flying anywhere and no real close ups. You don't really empathise with any of the characters as you did with Maximus when his wife and son were brutally murdered.So to sum up - no surprises. Your never on the edge of your seat.

613,justin55839,A disaster of a movie,3,15 May 2010,"I went to see Robin Hood with an open mind. I didn't read any of the reviews, I didn't watch any of the previews, and early on I thought that it was a pretty good film with a few loose ends that would surely be wrapped up by the ending. I was wrong. Nothing got wrapped up and there were so many plot holes and loose ends that left this movie a disaster of a film. Here are just a few examples:1) Who are the kids in the forest with The Strangers masks on their faces? 2) What happened to Prince John's first wife? We see her looking through a keyhole at her husband in bed with another woman but that's it. John tells his mother that he has written to the pope seeking an annulment but his mother tells him that it will never be granted. So happened to her? 3) Early on, the priest who is leaving Nottingham to deliver the grain tells Marion Loxley that she can't have the grain because ""she reaps what she sows."" What did Marion Loxley, other than conveniently leaving all her grain in a storage shed outside the main walls, do to deserve this ""reap what you sow"" punishment? 4) Robin comes to Nottingham and schemes with the Loxley's to pretend to be Robert Loxley who has been gone for 10 years. No one in the village catches on so we are to believe that EVERYONE in Nottingham either a) are new to Nottingham and didn't know Robert Loxley before he left or b) conveniently forgot what Robert Loxley looked like? 5) Robin tells us that his motivation for returning to England is to seek land and fortune. He's there to take advantage of the situation. Marion Loxley has him sleeping on the floor with dogs and they have no apparent relationship other than keeping up with the scheme that Robin is Robert Loxley. Why then does Robin go out of his way and risk life and fortune to help Marion get her grain back?6) Robin gets the grain back and we see a small group of them casually tossing the grain around on the ground. When Marion Loxley wakes from her afternoon nap Robin tells her that her fields have been planted all 5,000 acres?? 7) If you want to remember forgotten things from your childhood all you have to do is close your eyes and vivid flashbacks will suddenly appear. 8) The French had landing craft Saving Private Ryan style in the 12th century? 9) We see an army of horsemen riding fast through the mountains to get to the beach to meet the French landing craft. Before they go down to the beach they decide the horsemen will ride to the beach and foot archers will fire from the cliff side. What archers? In the battle scene we see thousands of arrows striking down the French on the beach? Where did they come from because they obviously didn't ride in with the horsemen? Did they fly in on helicopters? 10) Before the battle on the beach against the French I thought, ""This is going to be a slaughter."" It was. That is supposed to be interesting how? 11) Where is England's standing army? You know the tens of thousands of men in red uniforms with swords, bows and arrows, cavalry, pikes, and all that shiny equipment like we saw in the movie Braveheart? 12) We see Prince John an arrogant young man with a mistress in his bed early in the movie, then he confidently fires William Marshal and sets Godfrey off to the north with an army to collect taxes. Then when civil war ""unexpectedly"" sets off Godfrey is suddenly ""not the friend that he thought he was"" and John seeks to unify the angry mob because England conveniently doesn't have a standing army. Robin interrupts the meeting, gives a little speech, and they all ride off to war together. Then before the beach battle scene we see that John is useless because although he is suppose to be leading the army he doesn't know how to place the troops and instead relies on William Marshal to make a battle plan. In the battle we see that John is just a bumbling idiot, swinging his sword around randomly even after the battle is over. But in the VERY next scene we see that John is confident again, going against his word to sign the charter and declaring Robin to be an outlaw. Will the real King John please stand up? 13) Somehow on the battle on the beach, even though they were just fighting victoriously along side one another, we are supposed to believe that King John is jealous of Robin because the French surrendered to him? King John asks William Marshal, ""Who did the French surrender to?"" and William Marshal points to Robin. The thing is, it seemed to me that the French didn't surrender to anyone. The King of France ordered his boat to turn around so they could ""fight another day"". Was the whole ""they surrendered to Robin"" just thrown in to move the plot along? 14) How did King John determine that Robin was lying about his identity?15) What is the motivation for the kids with The Strangers masks on their faces? Early on they are evil looking thieves who steal the grain from Marion Loxley but by the end of the movie they are little ninja warriors on ponies fighting not just alongside Marion, but being led by her.",Robin Hood
614,d-givemeaname,What happens when a filmmaker has no passion for his subject?,5,13 May 2010,"This.All of the greatest films you have ever seen may be vastly different, but they share one thing. The people involved in making the film have passion. After seeing this overly long film, it becomes clear that no one involved in the project really cared about the film they were making, save for the production designer. The 49 year old Russel Crowe is sadly miscast as a pre-legend Robin Hood. Kate Blanchett does quite a good job salvaging her role, but her involvement in the climatic battle scene is just plain ridiculous. Speaking of battle scenes, the choreography is quite excellent, and Scott still knows how to create a large scale battle scene- he keeps things clear, establishes the geography, and keeps the audience involved.The problem however is that no one cares- the film is just too dull, Crowe just puts on an angry face and hits stuff, Scott and Co. seem to be more interested in the politics of the time than telling the story of a legend. Scott has absolutely no interest in doing anything for the character of Robin Hood, and the result is a flat, dull, film that just feels tired. It's visual pallet sums up the film, dull muted colours. Visually it is underwhelming, a wash of brown and grey will have you snoring in the aisles. No one making the film seemed to care, and neither will the audience.",Robin Hood
