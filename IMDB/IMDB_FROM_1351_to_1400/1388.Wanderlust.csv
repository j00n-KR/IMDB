0,SnoopyStyle,Jennifer Aniston should stop making rom-coms,5,8 February 2014,"George (Paul Rudd) and Linda (Jennifer Aniston) Gergenblatt are NY yuppies moving into their tiny expensive loft. Then George's workplace gets shut down by the Feds. Linda is thrown out of HBO for her ridiculous film. They have no choice but to sell their place and move to Atlanta to work for George's annoying brother Rick (Ken Marino). On the way, they stop off at Elysium where the place is filled with lefties weirdos.There is something wrong with Aniston as a rom-com lead. She's too mean unlikeably high maintenance. She has never come off as America's sweetheart. IMO she needs to do something different. Her best performance remains her lead role in 'The Good Girl'. This movie has a few odd performances with all the weirdos at the compound. It's meant to be funny but it just struck me as simply weird. The only comedy comes from Paul Rudd reacting to it all. There are just too many unlikeable elements in this. I don't like Ken Marino. I don't like the cheating storyline. I don't like Justin Theroux. And mostly I don't like Jennifer Aniston.",Wanderlust
1,Prismark10,Wanderful life,6,26 April 2014,"Paul Rudd is a financial executive who has been fired just a few weeks after he purchased micro loft in New York. Jennifer Aniston plays his wife who wants to make a documentary on the sex lives of penguins.They head out down south to work for Rudd's obnoxious brother but cannot stand being with him and end up in a hippie commune called Elysium whose figurehead is Alan Alda.As the tile implies in the commune which has a lot of nudity both male and female, no doors and talk of free love the couple decide to find themselves, away from the rat race. Justin Theroux has designs on Aniston and may also have designs on money offered by developers who want Elysium.Rudd has the hotels for Malin Akerman and also wants to get back on his financial feet leading to a clash between him and Aniston.The film is not laugh out funny but is edgy enough, some nice characters in the commune although some are eccentric and Theroux is obviously a shifty one. Some of the plot is rather predictable and it is unashamedly aimed at an adult audience.Its also good to see Alda playing a nice guy for a change after a run of oily unlikeable characters.",Wanderlust

Linda expects to sell a documentary about penguins to HBO to help the payment of the installments and George expects a promotion. However, HBO rejects the documentary and George's company has folded and he is fired. With the American crisis, they lose a large amount selling the apartment and George does not find a new job.

However, they decide to go to Atlanta but soon George has an argument with his arrogant brother. George returns to Elysium with Linda and they decide to stay for a two-week trial. A couple of days later, Linda feels well with her new friends but George has difficulties to adapt himself to the rules of Elysium.""Wanderlust"" is a terrible and unfunny comedy with a silly story. Jennifer Aniston is a great actress but his agent or she should be more careful with the screenplays they select. The cast has other good names, such as Paul Rudd, Alan Alda, Lauren Ambrose and Malin Akerman, but the moronic plot is too stupid and does not make laugh. My vote is three.Title (Brazil): ""Viajar É Preciso"" (""Triping Is Necessary"")",Wanderlust
3,nogodnomasters,STICKS GLUED TO ORANGE PEELS,4,14 September 2018,"George (Paul Rudd) and Linda (Jennifer Aniston) are a pretentious NY couple. When their jobs go south, so do they, to live with Paul's uncouth brother (Ken Marino) in Atlanta. Unable to live with him, they opt to go live in a hippy commune. As it turns out the members are not as likable as George originally thought and one has designs on his wife.I kept waiting for the film to become funny and break out of its predictable mold. It never did. Perhaps the funniest thing was Aniston ranting about Penguins being killed by global warming and living with the seals and polar bears in the Arctic. I didn't know if it was intended to show Aniston's character was stupid or the writer of the script was stupid. Penguins don't live in the Arctic. And since no one at HBO caught the goof while watching her film, I bet it was a stupid mistake made by writers who are not smarter than a fifth grader.I was bored for most of the film.Parental Guide: F-bombs, sex talk, full frontal nudity (male/female). No sex scenes.",Wanderlust
4,kosmasp,Comedy is a funny thing,8,16 August 2012,"Although this always play out in the eye of the beholder. I could imagine that some people could not relate or find anything funny in this, but I also read it in another guys review here. Just because this is R-rated, doesn't mean you're going to see a lot of the two main actresses (you will see a ""bit"" from one of the male leads though, even if it's not really his bit).I on the other hand as you can tell by my rating did really like it. I know the story has more than its fair share of flaws, but it's a lot of fun to watch. If you can laugh at the jokes at hand that is of course. Paul Rudd is playing his usual sch-tick, but his ""brother"" is the real revelation. He's really funny and awkward! The morality of the whole thing is one dimensional, but you can overlook that, if you can laugh about the movie.",Wanderlust
5,jboothmillard,Wanderlust,4,9 June 2016,"I had to search what the title meant, the dictionary definition of ""wanderlust"" is ""a strong, innate desire to rove or travel about"", I was just interested to try it having seen the colourful poster, directed by David Wain (Role Models). Basically in New York, aspiring filmmaker Linda Gergenblatt (Jennifer Aniston) convinces her husband George (Paul Rudd, also producing) to buy an expensive micro- apartment in Manhattan, Linda hopes to sell a documentary about penguins to HBO to help pay for instalments, and George is expecting to get a promotion. However HBO rejects the documentary from Linda, George is fired when the company folds, they are both forced to sell the apartment, but they lose money selling due to the financial crisis, and George is unable to find a new job. George's brother Rick (Ken Marino) in Atlanta, Georgia offers George a job position at his company, so he and Linda drive from New York to head for Atlanta, deciding to stop for the night at the bed and breakfast hotel Elysium. However a naked man runs towards them, George tries to drive away backwards to head back for the highway, but ends up accidentally turning the car on its side. Linda and George soon learn that the Elysium is in fact a community, many residents with various hobbies are allowed to express themselves, and they remain hippies and vegans, they are invited by the dwellers to stay with them. They plan to continue to drive on to Atlanta, but George has an argument with his arrogant brother, they return to Elysium, because of a great night they spent with the community Linda suggests they stay for a while until they figure out what to do next, George agrees that they will stay for two weeks. A few days later, Linda really allows herself to become part of the commune, making friends, not having to worry about money, and even embracing an option of free love, but George has difficulty adapting to the rules of Elysium. There is the point when George finds out that Linda has sex with resident Seth (American Psycho's Justin Theroux), and Elysium's owner Carvin (M*A*S*H's Alan Alda) is forced to fight for the right for the commune to remain, but in the end the married couple reconcile and start a publishing company, and Elysium is saved with a copy of a deed. Also starring The Heartbreak Kid's Malin Akerman as Eva, Kathryn Hahn as Karen, Lauren Ambrose as Almond, Kerri Kenney as Kathy and Joe Lo Truglio as Wayne. Anistin and Rudd, having been in Friends and another film together, are attractive leads and have good chemistry, producer Judd Apatow has made hits like Anchorman and Bridesmaids, this has nowhere near the same calibre, I may have giggled at a little of the obvious slapstick and explicit material, and the story of a married couple escaping modern society and entering a commune is alright in parts, but it is certainly not funny enough overall, a fairly disappointing comedy. Okay!",Wanderlust
6,moonspinner55,City couple gets stuck in the sticks with the Bohemian hicks...the pits!,2,4 March 2012,"Unemployed New York couple lose the mortgage on their 'microloft' and travel by car to Atlanta (to work in the Porta-Potty industry with the husband's obnoxious brother); on their way, a car accident leaves the marrieds stranded at a hippie commune in the woods where, initially, the free-living, free-loving lifestyle appeals to the emotionally-stressed and financially-strapped twosome. An alleged comedy, co-written, directed, and produced by David Wain--who apparently had help, though it doesn't show. Full of loathsome, offensive characters and jokes, edited in a sledgehammer fashion. Paul Rudd and Jennifer Aniston do have some appealing moments in the film's opening, but it's a long road downhill from there, what with an abundance of in-your-face toilet humor which may have been somewhat more successful had the rest of this disaster not been covered in flop sweat. * from ****",Wanderlust
7,paul_haakonsen,Welcome to Elysium...,6,19 December 2015,"What initially made me pick up this movie, aside from the price of $2, was the fact that Paul Rudd starred in it.The story is about George (played by Paul Rudd) and Linda (played by Jennifer Aniston) who live stressful Manhattan lives. When their World comes crashing down they decide to go to Atlanta, but they stumble upon a free-spirited community named Elysium along the way, and their eyes are opened up to a whole different way of living.While listed as a comedy, it is not the kind of comedy that will have you in tears from laughing. Instead it is a comedy that will put a great sensation in you and make you feel good.The characters in the movie are detailed, colorful and memorable, and they are well-portrayed by the actors and actresses. Especially Paul Rudd performance quite well in this movie. And the Elysium community had a very realistic and believable vibe to it.""Wanderlust"" might very well be an overlooked and underrated movie. I was genuinely entertained by it, and i was pleasantly surprised with the wholeness of the movie. ""Wanderlust"" is well-worth watching, so take a seat at the Elysium community and get comfortable. Don't worry about the door, because there isn't any.",Wanderlust

9,Boba_Fett1138,It just never really gets any good.,5,28 June 2012,"This is an offensively bad movie or one that constantly annoyed me but there is just absolutely nothing about it that stands out or ever works out as anything truly great or hilarious.No, I really didn't get any laughs out of this movie, expect for the very random Ray Liotta cameo. For some reason Ray Liotta cameo's always make me laugh. But other than that, the movie is offering far too little laughs. It's all quite predictable and besides its moments often go on for far too long.Same goes for the entire movie. It just goes on and on, without making a clear point about anything. Seriously, the movie for the longest time is going absolutely nowhere and I still don't understand why this movie exists. It's one you can very easily do without.It's also definitely because of its premise that I just see this as a very pointless and a not all that great comedy. I just couldn't buy into its premise of city folks suddenly trying to live in a rural commune. For me there was no good reason why they even tried this and it really doesn't work out as anything convincing. I wish the movie would had done more with its story and characters, to at least make the movie a bit more amusing to watch.I honestly really like Paul Rudd but if he like him or any of the other actors in this movie, this is still not a good reason to go and see this movie. The material they all had to work what was just too weak and not all of the jokes seem to have been thought through thoroughly enough, probably because most of the movie its jokes came from the actor's improvising on the spot.Definitely not worth seeing, though it remains far from the worst stuff the genre has to offer.5/10http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/",Wanderlust

Frequently hilarious fish-out-of water, high-concept comedy: dissatisfied NYC Yuppie couple Rudd and Aniston find themselves out-of-luck in The Big Apple and wind up in a hippie-dippy commune in this highly engaging comedy of errors with a fantastic comedic ensemble including Theroux as the group's defacto touchie-feelie ringleader and Marino as Rudd's a-hole bro.

11,neil-476,Not good. Don't see it.,4,9 March 2012,"George and Linda (Paul Rudd and Jennifer Aniston) buy an apartment in New York and immediately find themselves out of work. After a brief sojourn with George's brother Rich who offers George a job, they end up at a commune where the free-spirited life begins to have differing effects on the two of them.When I go and see a film which the critics say is awful, I always go in hoping that, for me, I will find them wrong. The critics said this was awful. I say they were right.If I go and see a Spider-Man movie, it is important that the movie sells me the idea that a radioactive spider bite can give someone the ability to stick to a wall. If I go and see a Die Hard movie, it is important that the movie sells me the notion that John Maclane can out-think and out-gun hordes of bad guys. The first and worst (but by no means only) flaw in this film is that, with the arguable exceptions of George and Linda, the movie parades before us a cast of characters each of which is no more than a container for a specific ""amusing"" schtick: none of them convinces us that they are a real person at all. They might as well be wearing labels - ""Funny obnoxious brother"", ""funny spaced out sister in law"", ""funny nudist man who doesn't listen to you"", ""funny weird hippy lady"", ""funny pregnant lady"" etc. Because the characters are contrived and unbelievable, what might have otherwise worked as far as story is concerned fails to do so. The fact that what is supposed to be funny actually isn't doesn't help either.I hated hated hated the bad language. It was crass and gratuitously unpleasant. It was one of the factors, but not the only one, why I hated the scene where Paul Rudd was stuck in front of a mirror gurning ""hilarious"" obscenities in a squirmingly embarrassing sequence where he is trying to work himself up for a sexual encounter. Simply awful.There was moderate nudity: not from the young people with attractive bodies (which Hollywood seems scared of), but from older performers. I don't have anything against this, but I would rather such a sequence included younger people.Jennifer Aniston gave yet another lazy performance.This was a bad film. Avoid it.",Wanderlust
12,anaconda-40658,Aniston Non Nude Tripe.,6,13 May 2015,"Wanderlust (2012): Dir: David Wain / Cast: Paul Rudd, Jennifer Aniston, Justin Theroux, Malin Akerman, Lauren Ambrose: Director David Wain seems willing to dabble in forbidden vulgarity, as seen in the wretched Role Models. Now he has dived into a project of equal depravity but the difference is the concept is much more curious. It regards the forbidden fruit within a hippie community that a financially struggling city couple happens upon one evening after several hours of driving. Paul Rudd and Jennifer Aniston are jobless yet find certain freedom with these people. They are nudists who live off the land and do not believe in closed doors. They also do not believe in the sacredness of marriage because they encourage sexual freedom. This troubles Rudd whose interest in the place is tainted after he learns that his wife had sex with the doped out leader. After the initial concept passes, the film becomes bent on shocking viewers with constant nudity including a slow motion shot of several overweight and elderly folks running towards the camera. It is strange that when Aniston pulls her top off, viewers are greeted with a fuzzy censor. It is rather insulting that she is censored yet any scene that is off putting is exploited. Rudd and Aniston survive the pornographic charade but Justin Theroux as the hippie leader is way too obvious in his intentions. Malin Akerman steals scenes as a sexually loose female who offers herself to Rudd without hesitation. Other characters are about as plain as the clothing they strip off. Strangely enough these communities do exist and are a great subject for comedy despite its willingness to tease our lust. Score: 6 ½ / 10",Wanderlust
13,HotToastyRag,Funniest movie ever!,10,12 June 2017,"Wanderlust is one of the funniest comedies I've ever seen. I've probably seen it close to 50 times, and each time I laugh just as much.A New York career couple suddenly lose their jobs, apartment, and lives as they've known them. While driving south for a potential job opportunity, they stop at a bed and breakfast, Elysium. Elysium, as it turns out, is a commune full of an incredibly colorful and hilarious bunch of hippies! This film, although on the surface is just a raunchy comedy, is incredibly realistic. Anyone who grew up in the 60s or 70s will point to characters on the screen and say, ""I know him!"" This is not a movie that makes fun of hippies. It depicts an accurate lifestyle at a commune. There are no doors in the house, natural foods and remedies are commonplace, and drugs are often used during bonding exercises. Yes, you'll be laughing, but because it's so realistic, not because it's over-the-top offensive.I love this movie, so obviously I'm going to recommend it. Jennifer Aniston and Paul Rudd reunite to play the married couple, which is an adorable perk for those who loved their pairing in The Object of my Affection. And Justin Theroux plays one of the men of the commune; you can see the sparks flying when Aniston acts with her offscreen squeeze and now-husband! DLM Warning: If you suffer from vertigo or dizzy spells, like my mom does, there's one scene in this movie that will make you sick. When the group drinks payote tea, you might want to take a bathroom break. In other words, ""Don't Look, Mom!"" Kiddy Warning: Obviously, you have control over your own children. However, due to graphic nudity, drug use, and some sexual humor, I wouldn't let my kids watch it.",Wanderlust

Him from his job at a financial firm and her (in one of the films more absurd moments) getting her ultra-liberal documentary passed on by HBO. They find themselves at a hippie commune run by Seth, which they initially fall in love with.This film started off OK, but the relatively few laughs at the beginning tapered off pretty rapidly leaving a rather sour taste in my mouth. I wanted to like this film, it just didn't seem to be in the cards. This made the marginally good ""Role Models"" seem like a comedy classic by comparison. My grade: D",Wanderlust
15,phd_travel,Funny parts throughout,7,8 August 2012,This movie has funny moments especially in the beginning (the scenes with Linda Lavin are priceless). When they move to the commune there are some painful parts like the mirror monologue but the laughs more or less continue till the end.The acting is good with a likable cast. Jennifer Aniston delivers a typical competent performance. Paul Rudd looks younger than her. He's good with the material he is given. Justin Theroux is quite versatile and almost unrecognizable.It didn't perform very well at the box office. It didn't find it's own special niche like the Hangover or Bridesmaids but I think it had about as many good laughs.,Wanderlust
16,zetes,"Really funny. I have no idea what film critics and audiences saw, but it wasn't this one.",8,30 July 2012,"The most undervalued film of 2012? I think so, anyway. Critics and audiences alike have decided that this comedy is lame, but I laughed at pretty much every gag and found the writing to be top notch. I'm a long-time fan of David Wain, who first appeared in the classic 90s sketch show The State and has done many things since, most recently the hilarious Children's Hospital, which shares many of the same actors as Wanderlust. Paul Rudd and Jennifer Aniston star as a married couple from New York who are forced to flee the city when they become unemployed. On their way to Atlanta to stay with Rudd's brother (Ken Marino, who co-wrote), they stay at a bed and breakfast which turns out to be a hippie commune, which they decide is a better place for them than Marino's house. There's conflict when she loves it but he doesn't. The best thing about the film is the care that went into the creation of the hippie characters. They could have easily been two-dimensional stereotypes, but the filmmakers and actors have fleshed them all out nicely. Justin Theroux plays their apparent leader, a charismatic, bearded man who has lived away from normal society a bit too long (""Why don't you just leave behind your VCRs and Nintendo Power Gloves?""). Among the others are Alan Alda, one of the original founders, Joe Lo Truglio, a nudist novelist, Kerri Kenney-Silver, kind of a soul mother, Kathryn Hahn, a judgmental ex-porn star, Jordan Peele and Lauren Ambrose, an interracial couple with a baby on the way, and Malin Akerman, a hot gal who believes in free love. Marino is also hilarious as Rudd's a-hole brother and Michaela Watkins is great as his alcoholic wife. Stand-up Todd Barry and Broadway star Linda Lavin also have great cameos as Rudd's co-worker and a real-estate agent respectively. Director Wain along with Michael Ian Black and Michael Showalter, who were all together in The State (along with Kerri Kenney-Silver, Joe Lo Truglio and Ken Marino) and were also the comedy troupe Stella, appear as banal Atlanta news anchors. The story isn't anything too special, but the lovingly created characters and their interactions carry the movie perfectly well. I suspect that, much like David Wain's Wet Hot American Summer, this will become something of a cult classic in the coming years.",Wanderlust
17,Sylviastel,I drink the nourishment that Gaia is feeding me through her cloud teats.,7,7 July 2019,"Paul Rudd and Jennifer Aniston are New Yorkers who lose their jobs and go south to Atlanta, Georgia where they stumble upon a commune. At first, they are taken aback by their lifestyle and commune living. When they venture to suburban Atlanta, they run back to the commune world. The film is laughable at some moments. It's profane and vulgar at times. There is nudity although needless though at times. Alan Alda and a great supporting cast make the film worthwhile.",Wanderlust
18,deloudelouvain,Warning: Wanderlust contains some hilarious moments,8,12 November 2017,"After reading some bad reviews I come to the conclusion there are a lot of bitter people. People that I would not like to be around. Humorless people with only one goal in their life and that is bitching and complaining. Wanderlust is one of those movies that will always bring a smile on my face. Not a shy smile like with some other comedies, but big laughter, certainly with some hilarious scenes. Especially the one where Paul Rudd is getting ready to get late in front of a mirror. Sometimes with my wife we actually play that scene over. It's one of those scenes you will never forget and that says enough about this comedy. Wanderlust has a good cast, an original story, but most of all it has a lot of funny moments. And that's what it is all about when you watch a lighthearted comedy.",Wanderlust
19,KineticSeoul,Obnoxious but not all that funny,5,14 January 2013,"This movie wasn't all that funny and just has crude jokes all around that just seem random. Which is fine but it's just not funny. Just about everyone in this movie is just obnoxious and annoying to watch. It's okay if there are few of these characters but everyone in this movie just acts like handicapped people. Nothing against handicapped people, but the characters in this movie aren't handicapped but act like they are. The plot is about these couple that end up losing their apartment in New York cause they can't afford it after the husband loses his job. So the husband decides to work for his brother who is a complete obnoxious prick. But they get into a accident because of a naked guy that lives with communes. And ends up spending the night there. Than they leave for the brother's job but ends up coming back to the commune because his brother is a self-obsessed prick. This movie really does show communes as crazy and obnoxious people that are bunch of hypocrites that act like they have single digit IQ. I don't know if communes are really like that because I never been to one but that is how it's portrayed in this movie. The obnoxious jokes gets stale after a while and it just become crazier and crazier but it isn't really all that funny. This isn't a bad movie but didn't leave much good impression after it was finished.5.8/10",Wanderlust
20,Hellmant,"Justin Theroux, in my opinion, steals the show!",7,21 June 2012,"'WANDERLUST': Three and a Half Stars (Out of Five) Filmmaker David Wain and actor Paul Rudd reteam (after working together on the 2001 cult classic comedy 'WET HOT American SUMMER' and the 2008 comedy hit 'ROLE MODELS') for this 'Free Love' culture clash comedy. It co-stars Jennifer Aniston (which is also a reteaming with Rudd, after working together on 'FRIENDS' for several episodes as well as the 1998 comedy 'OBJECT OF MY AFFECTION') as well as a large ensemble cast including Justin Theroux, Malin Akerman, Alan Alda and Ken Marino (who also co-wrote the film with the director, Wain). The story focuses on a married couple hit with hard times because of the economy who decides to try living at a rural 'hippy' commune. The movie is funny, thanks to great efforts from the entire cast and Wain's directing, but the script could have used a little more work.Rudd plays George, a recently unemployed financial firm executive, and Aniston plays his wife Linda, who had been working on a documentary about the shocking truth of penguin sexual habits (a real documentary with similar subject matter recently made headlines) which was rejected by HBO. They decide to move in with George's brother Rick (Marino) and his wife Marisa (Michaela Watkins) in Georgia, where Rick offered George a job, but after his brother drives them insane they decide to pack up and move again. They return to the bed and breakfast they stopped at on the way because they had such a good time with the 'free love' residents there and decide to throw their conventional lifestyle away for a new experimental life at the commune. Once they've stayed there for a little while though life there begins to drive them crazy as well.The movie is quite funny at times and not so funny at others but it's never dull. The characters, for the most part, are all enjoyable and or likable and the performances are all more than adequate as well. Rudd is in his usual top form and it's nice to see Aniston trying something a little different, which is what she's always best at. Alda is hilarious and Justin Theroux, in my opinion, steals the show; he has some of the best line delivery I've seen in a comedy this year. The movie does leave you wanting a little more, there was potential for the filmmakers to deliver something really good here, but it's still a decent enough comedy that's definitely worth a watch in my opinion.Watch our movie review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVtbIzK8ZjQ",Wanderlust
21,thesar-2,No One Would Lust Over This,1,3 March 2013,"This is what I thought: I really like Paul Rudd, I'm finally accepting Jennifer ""Forever Rachel"" Aniston is in two-thirds of every year's comedies and the trailer of Wanderlust looked like a funny and original film.This is what I got: a migraine of mass destruction, a horribly put-together mess of absent laughs and long list of cameos that have to be ashamed to have had said yes in the first place.Wanderlust is an abomination of wasted space and talent. I hated every minute of this movie and kept waiting for it to redeem itself. Instead, I witnessed Paul Rudd unconvincingly channeling Jim Carrey later in the picture and in front of a mirror talking about his little Rudd below. I think Mr. Carrey should sue for defamation of character.After getting an apartment the size of the west wing of Karen Walker's closet, the zero-chemistry couple, George (Rudd) and Linda (Aniston) are jobless and homeless (overnight, no less.) Giving up within seconds of losing his job and solving their problem, they venture onto George's even less funny and dick of a brother, but along the route south, they happen along a hippie commune.This happens to brighten up their last night before they reach George's sad brother and his wacked wife's house. When living with family goes south, they head back to fake ""become one with nature"" home. From there, they plan on a two-week trial to see if they like living with a wheelchair-bound Hawkeye Pierce and a butt-naked wine-maker. While you'll know exactly where each scene is headed, you'll expect laughs along the way but only to be disappointed with each missed opportunity. I mean, Paul's a funny guyuntil now.Maybe it's not his fault. Actually, I don't blame him for the aimless direction, poor editing, script problems and list of uninterested actors. It's supposed to make you feel good about life and nature, but I'd just as well take advice from Eric Cartman on going green than what they're trying to teach me.Avoid this mess at all costs. Even if I was a vegan, I would rather sprint over to McDonald's for a Big Mac in protesteven though, I doubt that's real meat – but it's the effort that counts.",Wanderlust

23,MLDinTN,are hippies funny...,5,9 December 2012,"that is the question this movie tries to answer. The film is about married couple, George and Linda, whom must leave New York City after George loses his job. My favorite part wasn't the hippies, it was when George and Linda go to George's brother's house. The brother says the most inappropriate things and his wife is a lonely, depressed woman and they have a foul mouthed kid. Needless to say, they can't stand to be there long and go back to the hippie place in which they had spent the night at before arriving at the brother's. There they live without doors, smoke pot, have free love. Some of it was funny, but there are much better comedies out there. And of course George and Linda must find each other at the end.FINAL VERDICT: It was OK; worth a view if you want some raunchy humor",Wanderlust
24,g-bodyl,"Funny, But Could Have Been Funnier!",8,5 August 2013,"Wanderlust is a funny, silly movie that features good acting. But I must warn general viewers that this is not a film for everybody. In fact, if you're an Aniston or Rudd fan, you'll be let down. This film is for a niche audience and I think ex-hippies would mostly appreciate this. However, I liked this film and found to be pretty funny. However, some jokes fall flat and they makes things somewhat awkward.David Wain's film is about a couple from New York, George and Linda who are both suddenly unemployed. They leave the city and head to Georgia. There, they encounter a community of hippie-like people and slowly but surely, they begin to learn the ways of their life.The acting is pretty good. This is a film that both Rudd and Aniston are usually not doing, but they really did a good job. The film has great supporting cast too. Malin Akerman, Justin Theroux, and Alan Alda all really had funny parts.Overall, this is a decent comedy that has some great jokes, but others were....not so good. But, the direction from David Wain is more mature than this previous film, Role Models. That actually may of hindered the film a little bit since I really loved that childish film.

They find more then the expected there. This is a very funny movie but it is not for everyone. This is the type of comedy where if you offend easy I would avoid it. Like most movies by Apatow or Rudd the dialog is so great that you find it hard not to laugh at the lines or the delivery of them. The cast is great in this and everyone adds their own brand of comedy but at the same time no one really gets in the way of the others. Just as a heads up though there is a lot of full frontal male nudity in this, but its really funny when it happens. I laughed threw the entire movie and there are a ton of quotable lines in this, but this is not a movie I would buy. Overall, a very funny movie that fans of Apatow will love. I give it a B+.",Wanderlust

A low point in the film was a scene with Paul Rudd talking to himself in the mirror vulgarly describing how he was planning on wedding with another female. It went on for a while and wasn't funny in the least.Some funny characters (the nudist and Alan Alda's character in particular) but mainly annoying and comedy forced characters that weren't funny (the older brother, the female hippie).

28,Movie_Muse_Reviews,'Wanderlust' overcomes meandering plot with quirky characters and organic humor,7,25 February 2012,"The humor of ""Wanderlust"" and hippie communes share a similar mantra: embrace it or get the heck out. ""Role Models"" director David Wain and comedian Ken Marino have written a genuinely funny movie, only one that's kind of pasted together like a spontaneous collage of humorous characters and moments rather than strung together with any notion of a compelling story.In that sense, it's almost a miracle ""Wanderlust"" works at all. A chance encounter with a hippie bed and breakfast and an impulsive decision to live free of social constructs hardly qualifies for conflict-resolution storytelling, but several colorful characters and a pair of likable leads maintain our curiosity as to what might happen next.George (Paul Rudd) and Linda (Jennifer Aniston) have just purchased an apartment in New York City. Days later, George finds himself jobless thanks to an FBI investigation shutting down his company and Linda fails to successfully pitch her hard-hitting penguin documentary to HBO. They then head for Georgia to stay with George's successful brother (Ken Marino) and his family, but after a night's stay in ""Elysium,"" they determine that a little detachment could be a good thing.Although rarely the source of humor, Aniston reminds us she's an effortless leading lady that can roll with any kind of comedy. Rudd offers the usual charms and some dynamite improv. A scene where he psychs himself up in the mirror could be considered one of his best ever. It certainly ranks as the film's most hysterical moment.As for the ensemble at large, Elysium teems with curious characters, including a nudist winemaker/aspiring author (Joe Lo Truglio), a spiritually virile classical guitar player that everyone adores (Justin Theroux) and a free-love yoga teacher (Malin Ackerman) among others. Rather than being pure stereotypes of hippies and eccentrics, the actors genuinely embody their characters. Not every bit is funny, but few lapse into unfunny territory—that is so long as Wain's mix of deadpan and obscene humor works for you.George and Linda's two-week trial run puts their marriage to the test of course, but little of that matters. In a way it works, because inserting straight scenes with the intent of drumming up the marital conflict would have marred the pacing, not to mention been remarkably unoriginal. On the other hand, it's tough to feel anything when the couple is at odds over whether they should have a sexually liberated marriage. So long as their attempt to do so yields comic results (and it sure does), who cares?Oddly enough, ""Wanderlust"" warrants numerous comparisons to the free-spirited lifestyle it both celebrates and pokes fun at. Although contemporary R-rated comedy techniques abound, (At what point will comedies decide to stop barraging audiences with flopping penises?) they seem less contrived in this movie. Everything feels more organic and care-free. Maybe it's as simple as the fact that nudists and hallucinogenics make more sense in a movie about hippies, but either way it works.But more than that, it's the choice to avoid the obvious contemporary jokes that sit right in front of our noses that earns ""Wanderlust"" kudos. Not one scene deals with either George or Linda getting frustrated over bad cell phone reception or saying or doing anything to debase or devalue the commune or the lifestyle there for the sake of humor. That fact will go under- appreciated by most viewers.""Wanderlust"" essentially lives and dies with its purposelessness. So many comedies self-inflict their wounds by trying to create and maintain too much of a logical plot, whereas this one spares us the trouble. At the same time, a noteworthy premise—executed well or not—seizes the necessary attention for audiences to feel invested in a comedy.Like its title implies, this movie meanders spontaneously in search of only laughs. It's the kind of strategy that will likely divide audiences, but those like myself who feel Wain and company pulled it off will develop a sizable soft spot for this simple but quirky comedy.~Steven CThanks for reading!

George's brother laughs at his brother's failure and says that George mooched off of him as kids and now he still does so as adults.George gets frustrated and leaves. The couple head down the road but Linda is tired so they pull up to an odd hotel. We see a nude man in the headlights with his penis completely shown.They have no choice and end up staying at the strange hotel that has given them a decent room. They find out it is a commune.

She tells him about the norm of sex outside the relationship in the commune. She tells him to imagine being inside of her in the meantime. A man comments saying humans were not made to be monogamous and you shouldn't suppress your desires. George and Linda agree on open sex with anybody outside their relationship. George gets upset to hear she slept with Seth immediately. Linda wants him to sleep with someone so they are even.George attempts to go up to dancing Eva who looks pretty as she dances in the spot. She wears a skirt and top, pink and beige colours. Later they go to the bedroom but George is way too nervous turning off Eva.

While on there travel they come across a hippie commune led by Cavin(Alan Alda). They quickly start to enjoy that lifestyle, has they really begin to settle in. But will this change be good for both them? The problem here in the beginning for me, is that Paul Rudd and Jennifer Aniston where not established enough, I felt they where just through in at random. Paul Rudd and Jennifer Aniston are just doing there thing like they do in comedies. But the jokes just overdue itself to the point where it's not funny anymore. Alan Alda does alright with the dialog he's giving. Malin Ackerman should have been giving more to do here. All in all, not an all terrible film, but not great either.",Wanderlust
31,dfranzen70,"Steady comedy fare, and nothing more",6,8 January 2013,"If you're looking for an adequate comedy that doesn't push any envelopes too far, that is warm and friendly but still contains plenty of adult content, then Wanderlust is just right for you. It's about two uptight New Yorkers who, on the way to relocation in Georgia, spend a night at a bed and breakfast that doubles as a commune - and find out they like it. A lot. The movie features playful performances by Jennifer Aniston and Paul Rudd and is harmless fun.The movie is written and directed by David Wain, he of Wet Hot American Summer, Children's Hospital, and The State fame, so you should know what you're getting - some gross-out stuff, some over-the-top stuff, and some stuff that doesn't quite work. Assisting him in his mayhem are former State-mates Ken Marino, Kerri Kenney, Joe Lo Truglio, Michael Ian Black, and Michael Showalter. Justin Theroux plays the ad hoc leader of the pack, a mellow man who believes it's still 1985 (apparently); Alan Alda is along as the last remaining founding member; Jordan Peele and Malin Akerman have small parts as well. On screen, that is.The basic gist is this: George (Rudd) has just lost his job when the CEO is arrested for something or other, just as Linda (Aniston) fails to sell a documentary to HBO about penguins. They've just bought an apartment in the Upper West side of Manhattan. Now they have no income. Tails between legs, they drive from New York down to the hinterlands of Atlanta to stay with George's brother Rick (Marino). Along the way - thankfully, in montage form - they bicker and make up, bicker and make up. Finally, Linda says she just has to stop; they've driven enough. The nearest place to spend the night is Elysium, and yes, it's as hippie- like as its name implies. There's a nudist who's writing a book. They don't clap, they snap their fingers. Guitar is played. Games like ""truth telling"" are played. Weird roots are eaten. There are no doors inside the house, not even for the bathrooms. It's a quintessential commune, as far as I know. I think the motivation of a character is the key to a movie, and here motivation is what (no pun intended) drives the plot. First they leave, then they come back. How could they not? Oh, here's something else - the denizens of the group practice free love. I assume the communes of the sixties were exactly like this one. That's what literature's told me. Anyway, let's look at our characters. Both George and Linda vacillate, as you might expect them to, and not at the same time, as you'd also expect. What do they want out of life, anyway? They're not young. Sometimes staying with the oddballs sounds like fun and sensible; other times, returning to Life makes a heck of a better argument. Meanwhile, Theroux's Seth has the hots for Linda, and Akerman's Eva has the same for George. Awkward. Kenney is a laugh riot as a dotty matriarch who's about as offbeat and, frankly, crazed as her character on Reno 911!. Alda is grizzled and constantly seems to be reciting the names of the other, long-lost cofounders of the place. It's trippy.To use a horrible cliché, Wanderlust is what it is - and nothing more. It doesn't pretend to be either an all-out slapstick or intelligent comedy. It's lighthearted, lacking in any serious mean streak (there's some obnoxious teasing on the part of brother Rick). It's an amiable, if slightly aimless, film. There are no twists to be wary of, no plot intricacies to keep track of. It's straightforward humor. You either go with it or don't, which is why it just misses the mark; the better comedies carry you along with them, either through rapid witty lines or pratfalls galore.",Wanderlust
32,PWNYCNY,"Before you go to a nudist colony, watch this movie first.",9,10 March 2012,"Sometimes things have a strange way of working out. Like when your life seems to be sliding down hill and then all of a sudden things start going your way, all because of some chance encounter, or was it chance? That is the theme of this movie. The movie contains some very amusing scenes, and Jennifer Aniston once again proves that she is one of the best comic actresses in Hollywood today. Her performance in this movie is endearing; she is thoroughly likable and carries the movie. The plot is shallow with no surprises, but so what? It is a comedy and it is is entertaining. The movie is a satire on family, materialism, work, and the whole back-to-earth movement. Some scenes are hilarious. Paul Rudd gives another strong performance as Ms. Aniston's harried husband. The movie contains some full frontal nudity but it's not gratuitous and actually adds to the humor.",Wanderlust
33,MBunge,Julia Roberts doesn't take roles like this,6,27 February 2012,"For one of the most famous actresses in her day, Jennifer Aniston has played second banana to a hell of a lot of less famous actors. I mean, pretty much all women in Hollywood have to play that wife/girlfriend role. However, it's one thing to play the wife of Jim Carey, or even the wife of Owen Wilson and the girlfriend of Ben Stiller. But Aniston has now played the lesser part opposite Paul Rudd, Aaron Eckhart, Jason Bateman and Steve Zahn. Steve motherbleepin' Zahn?!? And we're not talking about films she did at the start of her career. These were roles she decided to take after becoming a global celebrity on Friends. Curious careers choices aside, Wanderlust is probably the best and funniest yet of Aniston's ""Wait, isn't she a much bigger star than him?"" movies. It does crumble at the end into a pile of cheap, easy and hackneyed rubble, but it starts very strong and has a lot of humor of both the crude and clever varieties.George and Linda (Paul Rudd and Jennifer Aniston) are a New York City couple who just bought their first apartment, one that's a combination of extremely small and quite expensive. Then George loses his job and Linda's latest flight of fancy as a documentarian goes down in flames and they're forced to sell their micro-home and move to Atlanta so George can take a job with his psychotically obnoxious brother (Ken Marino). On the way down, they're forced to spend the night at Elysium, an ""intended community"" full of free spirited hippies and they're confidently out-of-touch guru Seth (Justin Theroux). They have the night of their lives and after experiencing the horror of living with George's brother, they flee back to Elysium where the exciting George persuades the reluctant Linda to try living there for two weeks. Well, Linda completely blossoms in the chaotic environment while George comes to loath it, driving a wedge between the two when George challenges Linda about Elysium's embrace of free love, thinking she won't go along with it but she, of course, immediately does. There's also a subplot about developers looking to build a casino on the site of the commune, but that and everything else gets wrapped up in the abrupt, arbitrary and pulled-out-of-thin-air conclusion.Now, a lot of the comedy in Wanderlust is broad, obvious and in the vein of ""Look how wacky these hippies are!"" It's still pretty damn funny and some of it's a good deal smarter than that. The opening scenes, which are almost like an extended montage, of George and Linda's life in New York do a great job of elevating, mocking and then crushing their dreams. And the gamut of emotions the couple run through on their regretful drive down to Atlanta quickly builds a level of depth into their relationship and makes their audience more invested in what happens to them. Nothing after that is as well written, but there are plenty of good jokes and absurd moments.It does seem like they got 3/4ths of the way through Wanderlust and only then realized they didn't have ending to story, so the Almighty Plot Hammer is brought to bear and an avalanche of nudity is used to cover for the character development that's skipped over. By that point, though, you'll probably have enjoyed the movie enough not to care and everything will get wrapped up fast enough not to bother you.Aniston, Rudd and Theroux are splendid and the rest of the cast, especially Alan Alda, are charming enough in their one-note roles. Co-writer/director David Wain also shows a fine hand. There's plenty of comedy in Wanderlust and from the briefest lines to more extended gags, he gives it all the right amount of time, space and rhythm.This isn't a great film but it's pretty good, even if you think you've had your fill of R-rated comedies. I do hope Aniston stops this pattern before she winds up playing Mrs. Robinson in a remake of The Graduate starring one of the guys from The Jersey Shore.",Wanderlust
34,dierregi,"Occasionally funny, never intentionally so",4,17 April 2016,"I despise pretty much everything with the Apatow stamp on, so I watched this movie only because it was a lazy Saturday evening, nothing much to do and no idea Apatow had any part in it. It started almost OK, with likable couple Aniston- Rudd going broke in New York.Forced to move to Atlanta and share the house of the Rudd's character obnoxious brother, our couple stumble into a hippie community, with more or less hilarious developments. Should be a pretty innocuous comedy, but it is ruined by the following:both Rudd and Aniston are way too old to play a ""young couple"". In 2012 they were both 43 but in the movie they are playing at least 10 years younger. Indecision and confusion may be appealing in youth, but are sort of pathetic in characters over 40.the brother character. I totally hated him and his performance, although it seemed to have been appreciated by many. Perhaps that sort of humour does not translate in other cultures, perhaps ""obnoxious"" is just not funny in my bookthe crass vulgarity of modern society. This is not an Apatow fault ""per se"", but he is certainly very good when it comes to show the worst of the American middle-upper class. In fact, he is so good that he carries things too far - just watch the uncomfortable scene of Paul Rudd shouting obscenities at the mirror. It drags on for what seems forever, it is excessive, it stupid, but most of all, it is not funny at all.This pretty much summaries every Apatow endeavor: filled with crass obscenities, vulgar, repetitive, unfunny and a sad reminder of modern American society.P.S. Apatow is the producer",Wanderlust
35,brando647,"A Lazy, Disappointing Comedy of Hippie Clichés",5,2 October 2012,"There wasn't a whole lot of advertising for WANDERLUST when it was making it's way to theaters and it sort of snuck in under the radar. This confused me at the time because Paul Rudd is a bankable leading comic actor, Jennifer Aniston has a baffling audience appeal, and director David Wain was responsible for the well-received ROLE MODELS (again, with Rudd) in 2008. So why was this movie receiving so little media attention? I was determined to see it regardless because the premise was something that struck a chord with me and I had faith in the filmmakers. So when I finally saw the movie, I understood it all: the movie was overlooked because it fails. It's not a horrible movie. It has a handful of chuckles somewhere in there but, as a whole, it's almost painful to watch. The movie follows George and Linda Gergenblatt (Rudd and Aniston), a Manhattan couple who are forced from their big city life when George loses his job. En route to Atlanta to receive help from George's obnoxious brother Rick, George and Linda stop for a night at the Elysium Bed & Breakfast, an intentional community of hippies living together on a farm under the guidance of Seth (Justin Theroux). George and Linda are smitten with their freedom and the overwhelming sense of peace emanating from these open-minded, loving people and opt to give commune life a chance. But when Elysium's free-wheeling ways begin to weigh on George, it might become the final death blow for his marriage.There are just so many misfires in this movie that I didn't anticipate. I had a lot of hope for the cast of the movie, as Elysium was populated with talented comedians, both improv and tradition: Joe Lo Truglio, Jordan Peele, Kerri Kenney, and even Alan Alda. I still consider Paul Rudd one of the funniest straight-men in modern comedies (despite WANDERLUST) and I was even willing to give Jennifer Aniston the benefit of the doubt after her turn in last year's HORRIBLE BOSSES. Justin Theroux was a big selling point for me, as I know he had a hand in writing one of my favorite comedies (TROPIC THUNDER) and he was one of the few high points in an otherwise disappointing YOUR HIGHNESS. I can tell everyone on set was giving their role everything they had, and I feel like a lot of the blame for why this movie flopped so bad lies with the writers and director. It looks to me as if David Wain relies a little too heavily on improvising on set and doesn't know when to cut a camera. I've seen him in behind the scenes footage and he obviously has a very awkward sense of humor that can work but maybe in smaller doses. And then there's Ken Marino. Marino wrote the screenplay with Wain, and he also has a role in the movie as George's brother Rick. I'm hoping Marino is no where near as obnoxious a person as his character, but if his improvised bits are any indication he has a harder time knowing when to reel it in than Wain.This leads to my biggest complaint with the movie: it just doesn't know when to end a joke. There are too many moments in the movie where the humor from a scene comes and goes but the movie refuses to move on. The biggest example (and the one you'll see most hated on in the forums for this movie) is when George is trying to hype himself up to seduce Eva (Malin Akerman). He stands in front of a bathroom mirror trying out his dirty talk in all manner of voices and facial contortions. What first starts as a chuckle (because it was never too funny to begin with) quickly turns to groans and then pleading for the story to move on. Which it does. To a scene where he is in Eva's bedroom doing the whole thing over again, except now Eva is present to share in the awkward disgust. This was the sequence in the movie where I officially gave up trying to care. It was hard enough from the start because so many of the characters are just so abrasive and unlikable with the exception of poor George. George is the only ""normal"" person here. It's as if he's fallen into some bizarre alternate universe where people have forgotten how to act likeI don't knowpeople. His wife Linda is an ungrateful shrew from the beginning, giving George a hard time when he loses his job (which wasn't his fault) while pursuing her own umpteenth failed career attempt. The residents of Elysium, for the most part, are just horrible people. Judgmental, rude, and unforgivingand these are supposed to be hippies. Some of their shtick is funny, particularly Peele and Lo Truglio's characters.On top of everything, the script is lazy. It relies on clichés for most of the laughs: the average man's reaction to casual nudity, pot smoking and guitar playing hippies, a bizarre, over-the-top connection to nature and human emotion. There is no real characterization to most of the inhabitants. It's just a bunch of surface jokes about the common perception of hippies with some naked old people thrown in for good measure. The final result is a movie that might elicit a few laughs out of you, but more than likely will have you wishing the 98 minute run-time didn't feel twice as long and feeling sorry for poor George Gergenblatt.",Wanderlust

Anyways it wouldn't have made any difference but still at least it would have made sense to the story.

37,napierslogs,Good people living with hippies with no intelligent thoughts or humour,5,4 March 2012,"George (Paul Rudd) and Linda (Jennifer Aniston) are practical and realistic people in love. They can't afford to live in New York City anymore so they are off to Atlanta. On the way they run into some hippies, their first instinct is to run away. Unfortunately, George's brother-in-law is an inappropriate asshole so they are back to the hippie commune, even though first instincts are always right.The first of many problems is the title. Wanderlust means an innate desire to live on the road, to be always travelling, never staying, and for no real reason. Hence, lusting for wandering – wanderlust. George and Linda leave New York City out of necessity and travel (basically straight) to the hippie commune. They are not wanderers. The hippies live in a home that they own. They never leave and they never want to. They are not wanderers. The producers just wanted a catchy title and money. I do not like that.I do like Paul Rudd and Jennifer Aniston. A lot. I did laugh at Rudd's occasional moments of physical comedy, but that was it. The rest of the movie was lame sex jokes. Remember this was produced by Judd Apatow but it was not written or directed by him. It was missing a touch of sophistication and consistency to the characters and a level of human understanding and empathy. This was movie was brought to you by some guys who watched a Judd Apatow movie and then while smoking pot liked the idea of free love, man.I don't like hippies, although I can tolerate the harmless kind. These hippies weren't real hippies, they were all just a conglomeration of all the various stereotypes. Which is too bad because I like Kathryn Hahn and she can play a hippie (see Our Idiot Brother). This hippie commune is populated with a leader who says it's not a commune but an ""intentional community"" because when we say commune it makes people think of hippies sitting around smoking pot and playing guitar. Don't worry Rudd just looks at him with his sarcastic smirk (as I said, he was the good part). The other good part, which proves how poorly this was made, was Alan Alda's character. He bought the place in 1971 with 9 other people all with the false hippie ideals of nature, sharing and free love. What we don't see enough of is how he is no longer a hippie. If they wanted to add an intelligent thought to the movie, or some good acting, they could have done it there.I guess I'm going to have to settle for Rudd and Aniston's previous collaboration ""The Object of My Affection"" which even after countless of viewings is funnier than ""Wanderlust"".",Wanderlust

Plenty of male nudity and language got this an R rating.

He doesn't do much, but he used to have a short-lived sitcom called Stella, which I thought was hilarious, and he also directed Role Models and A Wet Hot American Summer. his latest film, Wanderlust, was in and out of theatres very quickly, which is a shame, because it's the funniest movie since Bridesmaids.Paul Rudd and Jennifer Aniston play a New york couple who basically lose everything. So on their way to visit Rudd's brother, they end up staying at a camp called Elysium, which is a strange hippie inn that believes in free love, and basically doing nothing and being worry free. Once the couple decides to stay there, they both are put in a position that could tear them apart.The film has a weird cast of characters that include Alan Alda as the owner of Elysium, Justin Theroux as the bizarre leader, Malin Ackerman as his girlfriend, sort of, and Ken Marino, who co-wrote the script, as Rudd's bizarre brother, but I would hate to give any more away, because everyone is just too funny here.There is probably a joke every thirty seconds, whether funny, hilarious, or just plain disgusting, and everyone who is given the joke nails it. I was really hoping that its premise wouldn't grow tired, but thank goodness it doesn't. There is no hit-or-miss jokes here, all simply funny.There are also plenty of unforgettable moments to, such as when Rudd's character is trying to get jazzed up for sex... the actors know it's funny, and it's amazing they can pull straight faces.There is no single great performance here, everyone is hilarious, and it's not fair that The Hangover Part II can make millions and millions of dollars over something that is genuinely funny.

Things become even more predictable once they drop into Elysium, a free love commune. The writers did not like their Elysium characters. They sneer at them. I would have enjoyed the movie much more if the writers enjoyed and loved their creations, and just celebrated their dippy eccentricity. The writers seem to spit on anyone who does not eat meat, or drinks smoothies. To them, the vegan life style is not just an odd choice, but something deeply evil. It is almost as though they hired George W. Bush as a script-writing consultant.There is one scene when Paul Rudd has what could be called be an attack of Tourette's syndrome. It is so gross, I had to turn away. It goes on and on and on. I could not believe anyone would write such revolting lines for Paul Rudd. It is the most disgusting monologue I have ever heard in movies.The movie has a ridiculous happy fairy tale ending, which is rather fun, helping to take away the bitter flavour of the comedy.",Wanderlust

The first drop and return is thrilling but thereafter, unless in the hands of an expert, it peters out. The drops become deeper and slower, the returns never quite making it until finally, either it gives up or you do. And so it is with Wanderlust.Directed by David Wain, it teams Jennifer Aniston and Paul Rudd as a couple for the third time after a stint in Friends and The Object of My Affection. I hope this is their last film together as, on the evidence to hand, with each teaming their relationships and the quality of their work together diminish. I'd like to say it isn't their fault but they both read the script and took the pay cheque so, yes, they have to take some blame. Maybe they were struggling to pay the rent.At greater fault, and possibly beyond forgiveness, are the producers who green-lit Wanderlust and David Wain who also co-wrote it. It's a fun idea for a light rom-com (professional couple George and Linda leave New York with nothing to show for their life's work but a car filled with boxes, a job offer with George's obnoxious brother is too much to bear so they join a hippy-ish commune on a trial basis) and has enough potential for a light, easy, pleasant waste of an evening. Unfortunately the potential is barely realized and it serves to pass only twenty minutes or so before hope of more laughter fades.Yes, there are a few laugh-out-loud moments and some genuinely funny one-liners but far too many of the gags take so long to set up and reach the punchline that you've started counting the ceiling tiles before the film remembers to entertain again. Too many jokes are repeated, and not just once or twice, that they become tedious. It worked for Reggie Perrin, it doesn't for Wanderlust. Several jokes worked superbly in the trailer because they were tightly edited but in the full feature they bomb. Some of the alleged humour is so cringe worthy I actually hid behind my hand and had to stifle audible groans of embarrassment.I wanted to like it. Rudd is generally a good comedic foil and Aniston has produced some fun variations of Rachel and a couple in complete contrast, not least in the superior Horrible Bosses last year. But the occasional laugh, some attractive nudity (and some not so pleasurable) and a few star names cannot compensate for the wafer-thin plot, the stereotypes, the 'damn, we've got five minutes to finish this film' attitude to the end and stodgy, lazy scripting.Like the prosthetic penis on frequent display, you'll notice it and laugh at first but in hindsight you'll realize it was always limp.",Wanderlust
42,cultfilmfreaksdotcom,Grief Or Madness,6,25 February 2012,"How many things can weird, overly-openly-honest hippies do to make an average, city-bred couple feel uncomfortable? Well, about as many things as make the audience uncomfortable – and that's not such a terrible thing if Judd Apatow's producing. This has his signature over-the-top bodily function humor written, drawn and painted all over it. Story centers on Paul Rudd and Jennifer Aniston who, after both losing their jobs and driving to Rudd's obnoxious money-loving brother's house, happen upon a bed and breakfast harboring the oddest lot of hippies you'll ever experience.Going far beyond the clichés of pot smoking and artsy-fartsy naval-gazing, these people watch you go to the bathroom, exchange partners, and give birth right on the porch. The residents are too silly to be real, especially Justin Theroux as the picture-perfect bearded leader: a cross between Charles Manson and a game show host.But this is really about Rudd's constantly shocked reactions to the craziness occurring around him. With an old-school vulnerable nice guy humor the likes of Richard Benjamin, Albert Brooks, and Alan Alda (the latter playing the commune's dazed owner), Rudd has enough charm to rise above a somewhat (if not deliberately) banal script. And while Aniston is, once again, playing herself, she and Rudd make a good couple who happen upon a gratuitous Twilight Zone episode that, while not being very funny, sure isn't boring.For More Reviews: www.cultfilmfreaks.com",Wanderlust
43,lagudafuad,Go see another movie,3,7 June 2012,"Wanderlust tries and tries to make you laugh, but with the level of profanity and the weird nudity sessions, all I felt was disgusted and I left with a bad after taste.Wanderlust is a certified box office bomb just making 21 out of the 35 million spent on production. Filming took place mostly in Georgia, the director David Wain who is also the writer kept fans update on the production progress on his blog, but failed to tell them that they will be wasting their time if they go see the movie.I'm not a fan of listening to critics thoroughly, although I enjoy reading their comments but I have to admit with them this movie is crap.The movie did boast of many jokes thrown here and there, problem is none quite hit home for me, having a movie showcasing nudist and hippies and free thinking may be a good thing on paper but mix that with Jennifer Aniston and Paul Rudd pairing up is a bad idea, even on paper. The on-screen chemistry was not there, they looked more like cousins than a couple (arguable siblings).The plot show cases a couple who stay together George (Paul Rudd) and Linda (Jennifer Aniston), George loses his job and Aniston who is unemployed find themselves with only one option; move in with George's egotistic brother in Atlanta.On their way there, they had an accident and stumbled upon Elysium, a community filled with characters who don't believe in Money, Careers or Clothes. The couple found a home in this community and decides to give it a twirl.The actors in this movie must have failed a course in acting class or either missed the class called, ""How to act"", all the cast except from the two leads were either over-acting or either not interested in what was going on. The directing and the get together looks like someone must have been high on cheap drugs to put it all together, as David both wrote and directed it he must have thought (while high) that using swear words and nudity will be better than using proper lines.This is not Paul Rudd and Jennifer Aniston's first time of working together, they both co-starred together in 18 episodes of the sitcom ""Friends"" where Paul played Phoebe's love interest turned husband. Aniston has done some pretty good movies over the years before this movie was the hit ""HorribleBosses"" but this like ""Just Go With It"" (which also starred Adam Sandler) is not it at all.Save you money save your time, go see another movie.",Wanderlust

There isn't a moment that isn't predictable with only a couple of modest laughs. Rudd is quickly turning into the Everyman of ca-ca jokes (not a good thing) while Aniston still would rather take roles that highlight her beauty rather than the more demanding ones (such as ""The Good Girl"") that she attempted shortly after her film career began in earnest. Director Wain offers no indication that his style of humor (wacky, awkward moments) has the heft that is needed to distinguish it from anyone else; it's unfortunately evident he belongs here in the stable of Judd Apatow's bland filmmakers.",Wanderlust

They buy a small apartment that is still out of their league which is when George gets fired. George decides to go to his brother to cool off a bit, have a place to live and a job to work at. But they make an unexpected pit stop into a hippy locale and fall in love with their lifestyle and decide to stay there. How they adapt with the people, lifestyle and how they learn about themselves in this experience forms the rest of the story.Paul Rudd and Jennifer Aniston are in auto-pilot mode sleepwalking through their respective roles.

Jennifer Aniston was wonderful, proved she can act (for the doubters), maintained her super sex-appeal throughout, fitted in perfectly with all the other characters in the flick. No one was a disappointment. Paul Rudd was ideally cast opposite her, and had many chances to shine. all of which he took advantage of. Alan Alda was priceless ~ whatta cool part he played!! 
The author guy with the minimal loin cloth was marvellously understated, a real gem in this whiz of a piece of entertainment. I feel like seeing this again right away, probably missed a few bits of business. 
A terrific movie to watch in a group or on your own. It had lots of twists & turns, took me by surprise often. This flick is a rare treat, not ofetn I rate anything over a 6.

48,blrnani,What a waste of a talented cast!,4,4 March 2018,"The humour seems to be aimed at the pre-teen market, while the frequent flashing of male and female 'naughty bits' is evidently an attempt to drag in curious adolescents who don't have access to proper porn.
The comedic context was adequately established, with a (youngish) middle-aged couple pushed out of NY by the burden of an economic malaise that always falls on the most vulnerable and reluctant to submit to the insufferable arrogance of his nouveau-riche brother. They return to the commune they'd spent a night at on the journey down.
The leads were played by probably the USA's most likeable couple, JA and PR. And they are supported by a cast that includes Alan Alda and JA's husband to be, Justin Theroux. So what could possibly go wrong?
Well, as audiences are increasingly discovering, it's all in the script and this one, apart from isolated moments, does not come close to doing the film justice. Indeed PR's rehearsal in the mirror to get himself in the mood for infidelity is possibly the most pathetic movie scene I have ever witnessed, so far short is it of either being sexy or funny.

50,Twins65,"A 2nd rate attempt at a ""Lost In America"" update, minus the consistent humor",3,5 October 2012,"WANDERLUST had potential, as I laughed several times in the beginning until they got to the commune. Rudd and Aniston make a believable husband and wife team as an upwardly mobile Manhattan couple that ultimately wasn't really on the way up. And the scenes driving south and at his brother's place sure aped the Albert Brooks' mid-80's masterpiece I referenced in my title line, up to and including a version of the ""My legs are tired, let's live here"" line which caused them to pull over.Unfortunately, they pulled over at the Elysium commune, where the movie vibe was just way more weird than funny. I still laughed a few more times thanks to Rudd, as he's probably one of my favorite actors these days, both when he's playing the straight man off comedy or slinging zingers off the absurd (like a giant prosthetic dick in his face or taking a dump with company). But there just wasn't enough ""comedy"" to sustain WANDERLUST, and I can see why it ultimately failed to find an audience at the multiplexes. I really doubt it will find one on DVD either.I guess what I'm really saying is to go ahead and watch ""Lost In America"" again, and take a pass on this one.",Wanderlust
51,Bravesfan17,This was hilarious,8,25 February 2012,"Wanderlust is a hilarious film with some interesting characters and a funny story. The film stars Paul Rudd and Jennifer Aniston as George and Linda, a happily married couple who just bought a new studio apartment in New York. After George loses his job and Linda gets passed on by HBO, they reluctantly move to Atlanta to live with George's brother.On the way there, they stop at what they think is a bed and breakfast place, only to find out that they have stumbled upon a hippie community. After being annoyed about how his brother is treating, George suggests that they go back to the community, where they decide that is where they should be.The story is a fun one and is well worth the time. Director David Wain, whose previous film was the Paul Rudd/Seann William Scott vehicle Role Models, does a great job of keeping a consistent pace and letting the actors make creative and funny characters.Out of the supporting the cast, the standout is Justin Theroux as Seth. Alan Alda is a riot as one of the co-founders of the commune. Joe Lo Truglio gets some laughs as a nudist wine maker/novelist. Malin Akerman, Kerri Kenney-Silver, Lauren Ambrose, and Kathryn Hahn all do fine in their roles, but none of them stand out.",Wanderlust
52,jaxbubba,"Eh, another Judd Apatow Rom-Com!!!!!!",6,12 June 2012,"Another ""cute"" little rom-com for the Judd Apatow Production studios. However, this little film does not possess any of the punch of its predecessors. In this go around, Paul Ruud (George) and Jennifer Anniston (Linda) star was New York Yuppies that have recently lost everything that they own. Forced to depart NYC for financial reasons, George must coward down and accept employment with is older brother (played wonderfully by Ken Marino). En route from NYC to Atlanta, George and Linda stumble upon a hippie run Bed and Breakfast called Elysium, which many would consider a ""commune""; however, these inhabitants call an ""intentional community"". After a fight with his brother, George and Linda flee the confines of modern civilization, and elect to spend a two (2) week trial as commune inhabitants.The movie is very ""cute"", it's your typical rom-com layout. Boy has girl, boy loses girl, boy needs to get girl back. However, this film is neither overly funny, nor diabolical in plot. You basically know everything that's going to happen in this film within the first fifteen (15) of the film.I love the casting, and I will note that the chemistry between Ruud and Anniston up on screen really did work!!!! I really enjoyed the commune leader, Seth (Justin Theroux's character) for ¾ of the film; however, I no way believe that HIS CHARACTER, would ever do what the script called for him to do in this film. And its this last ¼ of the film, that is the most disturbing to watch.All in all, the film is everything that you have come to expect in your typical rom-com movie. Save your money, and wait for the DVD; and I would recommend watching this film in the comfort of your home. The perfect Saturday Night Chick Flick Movie Date film!!!!

Then when I see the naked man and the overturned car, I suddenly lost interest.For the rest of the movie, I watched it at 10 to 60x speed, stopping only when something looked interesting, which turned out to be very few stops.The movie seems pointless. They must be banking on Jennifer Aniston to make a pointless movie interesting, but it doesn't work for me.

54,patsworld,Tacky Is As Tacky Does,5,1 March 2012,"Wanderlust.is this a test to see how gross and raunchy a movie can be before people just say enough already? Because if it is, I'm saying enough already. I adore Paul Rudd and Jennifer Aniston is always fun to watch. But this movie could have been so much better, so much funnier without all the gratuitous sleaze. Rudd standing in front of a mirror spouting five minutes of pure trashy, tacky talk almost made that sweet, lovable guy disgusting. If this is the best sort of film that can be made and boy, there's been a lot of them latelyperhaps people need to be avoiding going to the theater altogether until things change. If pictures like Hugo, Descendants, Midnight in Paris, to name only a few, can be made, why is it necessary for money, time and talent to be wasted on stuff like this? There have been so many good movies made.50/50, Sherlock Holmes, The Green LanternI could go on for pagesbut there have been so many ugly, trashy films made in the meantime. too. And I could easily name them, but why bother? Doesn't anyone look at those tacky things, or stop and really listen to them while they're being filmed, and wonder why? Who's money is being spent on them? And again, why? Perhaps if a whole lot of money was being thrown at me, I'd allow myself to sink to the level of some actors and actresses of late and be in one of these lower class picturesbut then again, maybe not. Maybe I'd think, do I want my family, the world, to remember me in something like this, and I'd be smart enough to turn down the big bucks. Some of these stars should have done that very thing. Like I said, this could have been a really cool movieit had some funny momentsbut for the most part, I'd say this was gross.",Wanderlust
55,rawiri42,Not great - but not rubbish either.,6,30 July 2014,"Wanderlust is certainly not a great movie that will go into the annals of Hollywood movie-making for eternity. But then, how many are?Maybe I'm getting Alzheimer's but an interesting thing happened for me with Wanderlust. My neighbour rented it and, before returning it, knowing my liking for comedies, asked if I would like to borrow it so I naturally accepted. After watching it from beginning to end (and laughing occasionally), as I always do, I entered it into a database I have set up on my computer of all the movies I have seen along with a personal rating out of 100. However, when I told the database to sort it into alphabetical order, I noticed that I already had Wanderlust listed - with (would you believe) the same score! According to the existing record, I had watched the movie just under two years ago and yet, this time around, absolutely nothing reminded me that I had seen it before. My suggestion about Alzheimer's was, by the way, in jest because I have watched other movies subsequent times and, after just a few moments, realised that I had already seen them and even remembered the next lines. So what does this say about Wanderlust? No doubt, some psychologist would have all sorts of theories about that and, to be honest, I would love to know what they are. Unfortunately, the chances of me ever finding out are remote, to say the least.Lots of reviewers seem compelled to include a synopsis of the movies they review even though IMDb already does that very adequately. I will not waste readers' time by doing that. However, I will repeat a comment I have made more than once on IMDb that they should add another genre - that being farce - because Wanderlust is just that. The reason I say this is because, for those who check out IMDb before watching movies, when seeing a movie listed as both a comedy and a farce, they would be better mentally prepared for what is to come. (After all, why do they check in the first place?)Never having even visited a hippie commune, I am totally unqualified to say how true or otherwise the portrayal of one in Wanderlust is but, if it IS true to life, then I sure as hell don't want to go there! sure, it's hilarious to watch someone else sitting on the toilet trying to have a crap with all and sundry surrounding him and offering advice but I wouldn't want to BE him! But then I wouldn't want to ever live in a puny little box like that George (Paul Rudd) and Linda (Jennifer Aniston) had in New York either. I guess the whole point of the movie is a comparison between the two - which is somewhat polarised. But then it IS a comedy and I DID watch it twice and enjoyed it both times so take that how you will.",Wanderlust
56,bdgill12,Not a Whole Lot Worth Noting,5,25 February 2012,"Whether good or bad, love or hate, movies should always elicit a reaction; the stronger the better in my book. When I come out of a theater, I want to have an opinion of the film I just saw and I want to be bubbling over with comments to process and compile into a review. As such, one of the worst traits a film can have is a lack of noteworthy content. If I cannot muster up a few hundred words on a given film, then I can't exactly give a hearty recommendation. Such is the case with Wanderlust. Life isn't going well for George (Paul Rudd) and Linda (Jennifer Aniston). Just days after paying too much for a small New York apartment, George's company goes under and Linda's new business idea is wrecked. Jobless and penniless, the couple heads to Atlanta where George has a job waiting for him, courtesy of his obnoxious older brother (Ken Marino). On the way down, however, they stop in at a remote bed and breakfast which turns out to be a commune. Led by a charismatic free spirit named Seth (Justin Theroux), this group of hippies have embraced a simpler way of life that comes complete with all the amenities and ideals you might expect of such a community. Intrigued by the happiness the group exudes, George and Linda decide to move into the commune for a two-week trial run. Shenanigans ensue.Most of what I liked about Wanderlust boiled down to my affection for the leads, Rudd and Aniston. Rudd is one of the most likable, perpetually enjoyable comedic actors in the field today and he always manages to come across as a bright spot even in a bad movie. I think Rudd's charm comes as a result of his ability to bridge the gap between nerd and cool guy; he doesn't exactly belong in either camp and yet can walk in both. As always, Rudd gives an endearing and appealing performance here and exudes a natural, everyman charisma. I'm pretty sure several of the funnier scenes within Wanderlust are the product of Rudd's improvised banter and as such, this film owes a great deal to its star. Aniston, too, is a favorite of mine (despite some of truly terrible films) who has proved to possess a comedic touch when given something to work with. Her chemistry with Rudd is solid and while her role isn't as well developed as Rudd's, she does her job well and the pair makes for a solid combination. The other elements of Wanderlust, however, are lackluster. The narrative contains a few promising story lines but they aren't fleshed out with much pizazz. There are plenty of laughs but most of them come from easy, ""low hanging fruit""-type jokes that get old as the film progresses. And most of the supporting characters are as one-note as they come; each brings a few laughs here and there when they're in their respective elements but then run out of gas and become tiresome. Theroux, Malin Ackerman, Kathryn Hahn, and several others have their moments but none of them ever really get moving or show any signs of development. This lack of depth and development results in the feeling that Wanderlust is not so much a film as it is a bundle of individual scenes, vignettes if you will, tied together by George and Linda in loose, unsatisfying fashion.There's nothing inherently or irrevocably wrong with Wanderlust but outside of a few laughs and the appeal of the leads, there's nothing truly right about it, either. It simply is and that lack of significance makes for an overly ho-hum experience.Please see my reviews at thesoapboxoffice.blogspot.com",Wanderlust

OK, she has never been as gorgeous as Angelina Jolie, but she used to be somewhat averagely pretty. Now her face is made of rubber making her look like Gary Busey, yet another Hollywood transvestite, hurray...As about the movie, it's cheesier than cheddar.

His humor is directed at a young audience. It also helps to be stoned. I am the right age for a movie like this, but I failed to realize I was supposed to be stoned. As a result, the drawn-out humor of this movie— although funny at first—usually went dry far too quickly.Wanderlust is not what I expected it to be. The trailer is pretty much the first fifteen minutes of the movie. The actual plot of Wanderlust revolves around a commune that pulls in two city-folk—Jennifer Aniston and Paul Rudd. Paul Rudd has already proved himself to be a great actor is Wain's over-the-top movie with Role Models. Aniston has not. Her lacking acting ability has thrown many a movie into the crap pile. Unfortunately, Wanderlust is her next victim.There are plenty of good aspects to Wanderlust. I found myself laughing several times. The problem was that the joke would continue on for several more minutes—long past its expiration. I can't help but recall a scene where Paul Rudd stands in front of a mirror talking to himself for almost five minutes. It just kept goingand goingand going.Alan Alda was the redemptive role that brought this movie to life. As the original founder of the commune back in the 1960's, Alda plays the role of a senile man who lost a good majority of his sanity to acid. His role allows for the rest of the over-the-top script to plant its feet in reality. Where most of this movie is bland humor, Alda's character allows for a storyline to develop.If you are stoned, this is the movie for you. If you aren't, but enjoy the humor of Adult Swim, this movie will be somewhat enjoyable (still not better than any episode of Futurama). If you aren't stoned and don't know what Adult Swim is, this is not the movie for you. 2012 has been an extremely lacking year for comedy. Hopefully we can see that change next week with Project X.reillyreviews.wordpress.com",Wanderlust
66,songbirdmc,"I absolutely hate ""Wanderlust""",3,28 May 2018,"I love Jennifer Aniston and Paul Rudd, but even they couldn't make this film enjoyable. I hate sounding like an old fart (I'm 37) but comedies are just not what they used to be! I remember laughing so hard at ""The Money Pit"" that I could barely catch my breath and my stomach hurt. Comedies used to be amazing. I don't think ""Wanderlust"" even got a chuckle out of me. It seems like comedies for some time now try to use shock tactics, and rambling ridiculous dialogue, strange facial expressions, and pure raunch to get laughs from the audience. I don't find it the least bit amusing. In fact it's so disappointing to think that the best of comedies are behind us and never to be seen again. I thought with ""Bridesmaids"" old school comedy would be making a comeback but unfortunately there were a lot of modern tactics mentioned above in that film as well. It had good moments of comedy, but it was also dredged in absurdity. I'll just keep hoping that real comedy finds its way back to the audiences that love it. In the mean time based on many of these reviews many veiwers seem happy enough with the crap they spew out to us.",Wanderlust
67,MC1-Bjornson,Wander Where?,6,22 April 2012,"""Wanderlust"", Rated ""R"" for Adult Situations, Profanity, Adult Humor, Sexual Dialog, Graphic Nudity & Mild Violence. Running Time: 1hr&38mns.My Take: ** (Out of ****) -or- 6/10 on the IMDb scale I love my friend Lisa. She's a sweet girl who's always been searching for herself. She's spent a lot of time traveling and studying other cultures and philosophies. I remember corresponding with her when she lived in the woods at a commune in Florida. That's been quite awhile back. Last I knew, she wants to conceive a ""shaman baby"" that will grow up to be a great spiritual leader and teacher.I couldn't help but think of Lisa as I watched ""Wanderlust,"" the latest Paul Rudd and Jennifer Aniston date comedy. In addition to Lisa, there were many characters in the movie that I could totally relate to. That is what struck me the most: all the people in the movie that reminded me of many souls I've met over the years and still hold friendships with to this very day. ""Wanderlust"" overflows with ""Lisas."" In the opposite end of the spectrum, is a materialistic character of great independent wealth with his dissatisfied trophy wife. Wow, do I know my fair share of these guys in real life too. These self-employed businessmen may have it made financially though they might not be happy. I am also sure many do not know what they really want.The film opens with the forty-something yuppie-wannabe couple George (Rudd, ""I Love You Man"") and Linda (Aniston, ""The Bounty Hunter""), who are trying to make it in New York City. They purchased an overpriced micro-sized apartment believing, no, hoping this is the world for them. They want to be self-sustaining and successful. After George's employer goes bankrupt, he finds himself out of work. Linda's documentary pitch to HBO also didn't pan out. Down and out in today's economy, things look really grim.George's self-serving brother Rick (Ken Marino, ""Californication"") offers to take George and Linda into his over-sized Georgia home and give George a job. On their way, George and Linda take lodging at Elysium, a free-spirited commune off the beaten path. It is here, George and Linda encounter a variety of kind, yet eccentrically open souls. George and Linda enjoyed their Elysium stay. They are welcomed by those who dwell there to live with them, but they decide to continue on their way to George's brother's place.When the couple finally makes it to Rick's enormous home, they see firsthand what a miserable life Rick leads. He's arrogant, condescending and adulterous. His bored wife Marissa (Michaela Watkins, ""Enlightened"") is perpetually boozed-up to help her cope with loneliness and a virtual non-existence. Deciding to leave it all behind, George and Linda elect to move into the Elysium commune.What we get here is the ""fish out of water"" story. There are some funny bits about George and Linda trying to grasp the concepts of ""free-spiritedness."" Alan Alda (""Tower Heist"") is great as the former hippie Carvin who helped to buy this property in 1971. A lifetime of being free of society's materialism and regular ""overindulgences"" have helped Calvin to remain as the gentle being that he is.Probably one of the most memorable characters in the movie is Wayne (Joe Lo Truglio, ""Role Models""). He is a nudist vintner who likes to write novels and screenplays. It doesn't matter if the material he writes is boring and mundane. He's a happy camper no matter what. His first on-screen appearance is what will stand out for most people.The sultry Eva (Malin Akerman, ""Watchmen"") is all-about a free-love encounter with the married George. Meanwhile the maniacal Seth (Justin Theroux, ""Your Highness"") has designs of his own in store for Linda and the fate of the commune.There is an earnest sappiness about those living at Elysium. Each character exhibits a strong dislike and mistrust of the world outside. They are perfectly content with themselves and their spiritual journeys. For them, there is no other way to live. These characters are rather chipper and, unfortunately, contrived. Maybe that's why I'm giving this movie a mediocre review.I felt the subject of a yuppie couple moving to a rural commune was ripe for a comedic ribbing. After all, the stories I've heard about what goes on in these places, including how genuine and dear the people who reside in them are, would lend to a very interesting and very humorous movie. However, in the case of ""Wanderlust,"" I couldn't help but feel that the characters on the screen are fairly stereotypical ones. They were one-dimensional ""cookie-cutter"" weirdos, so to speak. Sure, there were some funny bits in this picture, but not enough for me to recommend it. Where were the big laughs? This kind of ""fish out of water"" story should have been ""off the hook"" with side-splitting laughs. Why weren't they there? ""Wanderlust"" was directed by David Wain, who also did the much funnier film ""Role Models"" (2008). The cast features some of the usual actors that appear in the Judd Apatow (""The 40 Year Old Virgin"" and ""Superbad"") ""potty-mouth"" comedies of the last decade. All the makings for a great over-the-top comedy seemed to be in place for ""Wanderlust,"" but the film ultimately feels a little tame to me. With this much talent involved, there's no excuse for ""Wanderlust"" to be as pedestrian as it is.""Wanderlust"" is an okay film with likable folks. It aspires to be more than what it is and it shows. I hope the topic of communal free-spirited living will be revisited someday by filmmakers willing to do something daring and outrageously funny with the material. Hopefully those filmmakers would have enough sense to talk to Lisa. Man, does she have some great stories. Now any one of those tales would be ""infinitely"" funnier than what this movie was.",Wanderlust
68,guyau-399-68372,"Flawed but funny, edgy comedy",7,17 June 2012,"Not the usual rom-com formula you'd expect from the leads, which might explain the poor reviews here. This starts with great promise as a satire of American society - epitomized by the wonderfully crass, materialistic brother - with some great laugh-out loud moments as the American dream goes wrong for Judd and Aniston. The humour is often off-beat and at times anarchic, such as when the horse appears in the couple's doorless room at the commune. Ultimately though, it just wants to poke fun at everyone and loses the plot, ending up as the formulaic rom-com it promised not to be. You really get the feeling this is an intelligent script put through the studio wringer. Judd's mirror scene is a weird low point, proving that improvisational riffing is often just a self-indulgent waste of screen time. If full-frontal male nudity (one of the commune's main characters is a perpetual nudist) and off-beat attempts at satire offend, you won't like this, but there are good laughs to outweigh the flaws.",Wanderlust
69,ecodrynv,I thought it was pretty damn funny,8,1 May 2021,There are a lot of scenes in this movie that I laughed out loud at. Paul Rudd is incredible at creating very uncomfortably funny moments with his awkwardness. Key and Peele are also in this movie and both have some pretty funny roles. I don't understand the bad ratings for this because I found it to be a fun film to watch. They have some reoccurring jokes that hit just enough to not be overdone as well. Everyone did a good job acting as well.,Wanderlust
70,DoctorRabbit,Never Lives Up To It's Full Potential,6,26 June 2012,"Wanderlust has a few good moments, but it is just not that good or funny of a movie. Most of the movies problems seem to be from the product of a weak script. The film has a few very funny moments, but a lot of other moments come off as not very funny or are dragged out way too long and just become awkward or annoying. The movie also suffers from another problem that i've noticed in comedies lately which is awkward cuts right after a joke hits a punchline, which is an issue that is present a lot in the first half of the film. By the end of the film, I couldn't help but think why did this movie even need to be made because it doesn't seem like anyone behind it had any interest or passion in really making it. Overall, Wanderlust isn't terrible, but you could never see it your whole life and you wouldn't miss out on anything. If you really feel like you need to see it then rent it. Otherwise, i'd just save your time and skip it.",Wanderlust

The comedy is great but selective . Not everyone would enjoy the movie.

73,reneemsm,"One big ""meh""",4,20 June 2012,"I definitely did laugh a few times during this. But what's really sad is that the most my husband and I laughed was at the outtakes in the credits (and of course, the bathroom mirror scene). I found myself so IRRITATED at all of the characters through the whole movie. There were times that I just wanted reach through the screen and smack someone. And there are a few scenes that are just so awkward that they make you want to shut it off. I mean, there's awkward-funny and then there's awkward-annoying. This was awkward-annoying. I really like Paul Rudd and sometimes Jennifer Aniston. And I like about 75% of Judd Appatows movies (generally the ones where he doesn't cast his wife who can't act worth a sh*t). I wanted to like this and I really do feel like the idea was good and it could have gone a different way and been a really good film. But unfortunately the script just doesn't work.

74,silverpinkcity,"I don't care, I liked it!",9,12 August 2021,"I was so surprised to come here and find this low score for Wanderlust. I just watched this 2012 movie and totally enjoyed it!Is it silly? Yes. Is it farfetched? Perhaps. Is there crudeness? Definitely. But so what? This is a COMEDY, people! It's supposed to be silly. It's not a drama or a documentary. Besides that...it's rated ""R,"" so it's an ADULT comedy. Not for kids. Obviously.In the movie, the two stars (Jen Anniston and Paul Rudd, who play George and Linda) run into financial, along with employment trouble in the city and need to find a new place to live and make a ""fresh start."" So they head to Atlanta to crash with George's brother (a total jerk) and his wife.On the way, they wander accidently into a hippie commune, thinking it's a hotel. That's where the craziness begins. Although, if you ask me...the movie starts off being funny right from the get-go! The whole relationship aspect of this couple; their grievances and squabbles, will probably be relatable in some way to most people...portrayed in a light humorous way, of course.Yes, some of the characters are cliché and two dimensional. It doesn't matter. The movie works overall, since it has a very unique feel about it. And then there's Paul Rudd. No matter how you might feel about this guy in other movies, he definitely makes THIS movie work! He's engaging and funny, while Jennifer Anniston plays off him perfectly as his wife.There are many issues the couple face at the commune...where they ultimately decide to stay, since being there (initially) makes them feel so joyous and free.They have the ""lack of privacy"" issue for one (no bathroom door)?Then there's going ""vegan""...and the guy who traipses around nude all the time...and let's not forget the free love; the sharing of everything, including partners.Oh. And then there's Seth...the sexy leader of the commune. It seems that George's wife definitely has a ""thing"" for him. And let's not forget Alan Alda...he's in the movie too, playing the likable old guy who owns the place.There's a plot to this movie....a relationship you route for....and a very interesting ending. There's laughter and silliness along the way. What more could you ask for? Do I recommend this movie? I think the answer is obvious.",Wanderlust
75,jcsuperjake,Wanderlust,7,27 February 2012,"So, I saw Wanderlust the day it opened. The trailers, as everyone knows, just looks stupid. But, the movie, being Judd Apatow and all, is not that stupid. George and Linda move to Atlanta for a better opportunity, until they stumble upon a love commune. Note: Love communes are not nudists communes. Though, there is a nudist. This movie has a good cast. I thought Justin Theroux was really good as a hippy-ish guy, trying to make Jennifer Aniston love him. And lets face it, this will be the closest we will ever get to see Jennifer Aniston boobs, okay? So, stop complaining, it will NEVER happen. Best comedy ever? Hell no.

Paul Rudd(George) and Jennifer(Linda) work well together. The heavy lifting is done mostly by the supporting cast. Ken Marino as George's successful brother was a riot. George's wife played by Michaela Watkins, was killing me with her one liners. If you want to laugh hard then this film is it. Justin Theroux as Seth was priceless.

80,callist,A mixed pleasure,5,29 March 2013,"This movie had both strong points and weak points. The strength lay mainly in the comedy aspect - there were definitely funny jokes (maybe not laughing-out-loud funny, but then again, that's not my favorite form of comedy). It has a pretty unique tone, though this was intercepted by the weaker points. As far as strength goes, acting was fine too.Weak points lay mostly in the clichés - regarding everything from plot to character types to dialogue. There were a lot of them and sometimes that really detracted from the enjoyment of this movie. There was just too much and not done well enough. It could have been a unique take on a tired genre, but it sticks to being safe and that detracts from the experience.Still: 5/10 - I'll probably never watch it again but I don't regret spending my time on it (coming from someone who isn't really into rom-coms to begin with).",Wanderlust

Some great actors too, surely they wouldn't have signed up to a turd of a movie - that speaks volumes for me. Sure the characters are a bit pantomime at times especially the brother of the main character but still, it's so well written such a crime is entirely forgivable. I'm surprised too that in the 4 years we've been in recession there hasn't really been a lot of content has been released concerning the recession itself, and this also sets the film apart.

83,seagem,Sophomoric Softie,3,23 August 2014,"Back in the 70's this would have been classified as soft porn - flaccid, bouncing body parts make you want to look away, dialogue so laden with sexual content only those registering as mental pre-teen are going to snicker and enjoy this kind of fare. Keep moving folks, nothing to see here: isn't that what they say at the scene of an accident? Well, this movie certainly is one in so many ways.It was fun to see Alan Alda and Linda Lavin in their supporting roles - if you are going back to the '70's who better than these two stalwarts of the period - problem is they have limited time on the screen and don't really have a chance to show their chops.Paul Rudd is very talented but mostly in the length of a SNL television skit. Painful to watch the scene where he is psyching himself up in the bathroom to stray into infidelity - talking to himself to build his courage. Way too long and most of the scene should have been edited out.Jennifer Aniston is very likable and is much better in Horrible Bosses and We're the Millers which isn't saying a lot but gives perspective that she is wasted here. I could have gone a long time without seeing her simulate using a leaf on herself while she squats in the commune front yard.The supporting cast especially the women did a good job in each of their roles. Justin Theroux as Seth did not help his film career. An age peer of Alan Alda would have been much better than Theroux. Someone against type who could be over the top as the commune leader. I would loved to have seen Al Pacino in the role or even Tom Selleck (another TV throwback to go along with Alda and Lavin) as the out of touch emotional cannonball/still horny-for-strange women-leader of the pack. Now that could have made this watchable. Plus a better script. Plus better editing. Plus abandon the stream of consciousness trash mouth scenes.

There were one or two scenes that did the ""family guy"" thing, ie, going on far too long and just being uncomfortable. The mirror scene I laughed at the first minute, cringed the next, and felt sick towards the end lol... Although because of this set up I found the credits out-take scene of this hilarious.

Watching this, I thought to myself - this movie was obviously funny only to the people on the set, while it was being made. Maybe I would have laughed too if I was there with them. It's either that or none of the actors have any sense of humor. Which I don't believe is the case, because some of these actors are generally good, I guess they just fell victims to a devastatingly bad script.In other words, this movie sucks big time. I mean, I didn't expect much, since it's a romantic comedy, and such movies are practically supposed to be uninventive and predictable. But this one is almost unbearable to watch. There is no plot whatsoever, the characters are mostly idiotic (not funny kind, just plainly idiotic); I think personally the only positive thing about this movie would be Jennifer Aniston, but her performance wasn't quite admirable as well. I guess that's because the movie didn't require any performance to begin with. Just a bunch of aimless characters, with moronic lines that don't make any sense most of the time.There is a mild improvement in general perspective of the movie while it gets closer to the end, when it gradually blends into ""the romantic-comedy cliché"" (I can't believe that I actually said that a cliché is an improvement, but in this case this is true). Unfortunately, it's not remotely enough to make it worth while.Want my advice? Skip this one!",Wanderlust

We new it would be a good one from the same guys who wrote Role Models.Paul Rudd played his usual character. Middle aged, laid back white guy. They gave him some REALLY dirty lines to say. Jennifer Aniston was suited for this Rated R comedy much better than Horrible Bosses. I thought Malin Akerman could have had a bigger part. Alan Alda had a somewhat big part, which I was surprised.The negatives were that it simply didn't need to be as dirty as it was. Their was some grotesque male nudity that just didn't need to be there, but at the same time, you know what you are signing up for. Ultimately, this is going to do horribly at the box office.

This movie is filled with failed attempts at humor, don't get me wrong, some parts are genuinely funny, but most of it seems like they tried too hard to get a laugh.

92,themoviecouch,My face hurts!,9,19 August 2012,"What a laugh riot! I can't believe this movie slipped by me in theaters, but I'm glad we put it on our Netflix queue. ""Wanderlust"" brings together some of my favorite people in comedy. Written and directed by alums of the MTV comedy show ""The State"" (David Wain and Ken Marino), the movie features several of the old ""The State"" actors as well as Paul Rudd and Jennifer Aniston. On top of all that, Judd Apatow produces. With a pedigree like that, you may expect something hilarious, and you would be right!Rudd and Aniston play George and Linda, an attractive pair of New Yorkers who have just purchased a tiny, expensive West Village apartment when their economic world collapses. Unemployed and facing homelessness, they head to Georgia so George can work for his hilariously boorish brother (Ken Marino). Along the way they accidentally spend the night at a hippie commune and find the experience surprisingly liberating. Working and living with George's brother turns out to be so unbearable that the pair flee back to the commune to give ""intentional community"" a try. Someone needs to come up with some kind of facial yoga I can do before watching a movie like this, because ""Wanderlust"" made me smile and laugh until my face hurt. From the very first scene, Rudd and Aniston knock the ball right out of the park, and every new character who walks across the screen lights it up. Everyone is so good that I really can't mention all the great comedic performances, although Justin Theroux does deserve mention for his over-the-top portrayal of hippie alpha-male Seth. They also brought in Alan Alda to play the senile commune founder and add a touch of class. I suppose if I had any criticism it would be that most of the hippie jokes are pretty well- worn. The movie is fairly predictable, but big deal, they are all predictable once you've seen enough of them. When the story is this funny and told this joyously, it doesn't matter.Just. Watch.

Other than that, we were sorry that we bothered to attend the screening. And there was no reason for having Alan Alda in the movie at all.

When I watched that part, I thought ""What great directing!"" But then, when I read on IMDb that Rudd improvised that scene, I thought ""What a great comic acting genius he is"". So although there are a few hokey scenes (the psychedelic trip, the 2 cars in the pond) in all, the film is entertaining at least, and hilarious at best, especially due to Rudd's great improvisation. With something this light, it's best not to over-analyze its elements. (and by the way, I thought that Jennifer Anniston was very good, despite other reviewers comments).

The scene where the Jennifer Anniston character pitches her save-the-penguins film to HBO satirizes both her and the network. And the montage of the auto trip, showing the various changes of mood they go through over several hours, is both realistic and hilarious. But I didn't laugh much after that.The real problem with this film is that it is essentially a satire directed at the hippie movement. There might have been a point to this thirty years ago, but now??? I don't know if there even are any hippie communes left, but they are hardly significant enough in our culture to rate a full-length satire. And are we surprised that the most outspoken proponent of free love and spirituality turns out to be a hypocritical jerk? And how about the attack on the heartless developers? Are we supposed to take that seriously? This theme was developed more effectively, tongue-in-cheek, in ""The Muppets"" where at least we knew it was intended as a cliché.I usually like Paul Rudd, but I found his attempt to come off as macho to get into bed with a gorgeous blonde totally unconvincing and unfunny. He is such a cool guy that I could not believe he would not know how to approach a woman for sex.For me the one bright spot in the film was Alan Alda's portrayal of an aging hippie, possibly in the early stages of Alzheimers. He was the one character who came across as genuine. In fact, in a better film he might have gotten some Oscar buzz for best supporting actor.Overall, a pointless film.",Wanderlust

This film doesn't deserve a seven, but it's not quite so low as a six either. It's a meandering film at times, and while Rudd is always great when he's in the role of the middle class and dependable husband/boyfriend put into an unexpected situation, he does have a great deal of comedic talent, and even when he's in a supporting or ensemble cast he generally winds up carrying and being the best thing about most of the movies he's in, Aniston on the other hand is still trying to play the young ingénue she played on ""Friends"" a decade ago (though she appears to be a sweet woman no matter what role she's playing, and I think that's because she really is a sweet woman who unfortunately isn't a great actress; I think most of her roles to date are basically Aniston playing Aniston). Yes, ""Horrible Bosses"" WAS a step away from her comfort zone, but her success in that film seemed more based on the character having been created for her than what I can only say was obviously the little and forced effort she put into creating the character. With that movie she could have gone a lot further; despite her supposed sex/power addiction she still seemed like Rachel dressed up like a dominatrix for Halloween, more interested in how she might still look pretty in the nightclub light than how to wield the power her character so desperately needs to make her believable. In ""Wanderlust"" Aniston's performance is woody, she just can't get into playing a middle aged woman (and c'mon, despite the lighting and the makeup and the botox that's what she is!) who just might want to explore and find out that she is or can be more than the shallow, hungry to succeed city girl that she plays so well in movies and in Hollywood. I'm a middle aged woman myself, and while Rudd's journey is funny and at times touching in his innocent exploration of his societally defined identity, Aniston doesn't bring to the role a sense of identity that a woman her age should have acquired by now. She has a lot of money in real life, so maybe she can stay virtually young forever on the outside, but her acting tells me she's also stayed young, far too young, on the inside. Maybe she'll find that depth as she grows older; if not then she's a TV star past her prime who should stick to the small screen, maybe there she'll again find a niche by playing yet another version of herself. I just hope she learns to play closer to her age -- perhaps a daily job to remind her she's not a twenty something anymore will help her grow up and stop it with the coy little gestures and the wide eye surprise that are cute with the Twilight set but not at all so in a menopausal (or close to it) woman in her mid-forties.",Wanderlust

Wanderlust features George (Paul Rudd) and Linda (Jennifer Aniston) who are hit with sudden unemployment. This couple looks for life elsewhere, when they stumble across Elysium, an alternative rural commune where free love rules, yeah. After being invited to live with the community they begin to experience their lifestyle, which leads to some funny encounters.Wanderlust has received a lot of hate for not being that good, and yeah its not the best movie in the world but it doesn't mean its the worst. Wanderlust is a strange movie, its funny at points, largely finding humour in awkward experiences and the scene with Paul Rudd and the mirror is probably its most recognisable scene, as it is hilarious. As far as being a great movie, id say its a pretty average film, you'll get some laughs, but in comparison to some of Paul Rudd's other movies its not as good, not forgetting the large amount of inappropriateness. The cast of this movie is packed full of hilarious actors and i think the reason we don't find it as good as we expect to be so because there are so many funny actors in it.

I was surprised and increasingly confused as I read one negative review after another. My confusion grew to frustration as I read comments like ""the only nudity is old, unattractive people"" and ""the characters aren't believable"". I feel these people have completely missed the point! First of all, if you want to see attractive people naked then may I politely suggest that romantic comedy is the wrong genre for you, I believe you'd get what you want in the 'adult' category - it's certainly bizarre and irrelevant to give this film a negative review because you don't get to see Jennifer Aniston in the buff! Secondly,regarding the characters and all the oh-so-serious reviewers commenting on the silliness and irreverence of the plot and the character development, this is the sort of film that doesn't need to develop the characters or have a deep plot, it wouldn't work as well if it did actually. It's a light-hearted, fun movie. And it works. In my opinion it actually works beautifully, the whole film has a great vibe to it and certainly had me thinking that I might enjoy a brief dalliance on a commune!

115,headstocki,Surprisingly Disappointing,5,16 June 2012,"WANDERLUST - 5/10.Being as I am more than fond of both Judd Apatow (Producer) and Paul Rudd (Lead Actor/Co. Producer) I was extremely eager to watch Wanderlust but came out of it disappointed and honestly quite shocked by the fact that Apatow had produced something so mediocre!That being said I did laugh in this film on quite a few occasions actually, in particular the mirror scene which was to say the least hilarious. In my opinion it was these rare moments of overstated humour and light satire which made the film bearable. Another strong point is the running time; thankfully this film doesn't drag on too much to the point where it becomes tedious.Rudd is consistently brilliant in nearly every release he has been in and Wanderlust is certainly no exception, but the person that stole the show for me personally was Joe Lo Truglio as Wayne the nudist novelist. I feel that in previous films Truglio has shined, never having a large part but still managing to have a huge impact on the overall humour of a film, notable examples are Kuzzick in Role Models (also alongside Rudd and director David Wain) and my personal favourite Lonnie in I Love You, Man (again, alongside Rudd). I feel that Truglio has this same effect in Wanderlust and that he played one of the more likable and overall interesting characters amongst a cast that is generally dull.Jennifer Aniston tries. Everything she does in this film comes off as a bit too eccentric, for example the weird acid trip she has just felt awkward and kind of unnecessary. The only thing that the does to a truly good standard is playing the 'un-employed go-getter living in the midst of a bustling Manhattan' but to be fair this sort of role has got to be second nature for her. Frankly the more in-your-face kind of comedy is a little out of Aniston's comfort zone and this does show a bit in Wanderlust.A lot of other reviews are advising you not to watch it but I disagree based on the fact that you could definitely do a lot worse. You should especially watch this if you enjoyed Wain's Wet Hot American Summer being as both films share a light form of satire. Wanderlust does not match Wet Hot American Summer in terms of overall comedy but I feel that the two are still comparable. Sure, nothing in Wanderlust is worth writing home about (apart from maybe the mirror scene which truly is, hilarious) and it is fairly forgettable but if you are ever in the mood for something light-hearted not to be taken too seriously kind of film then you can't go wrong with Wanderlust.",Wanderlust

122,waldo621,I understand if people don't like this movie but I really enjoyed it.,8,8 July 2013,"First off, the movie stars Paul Rudd and Jennifer Aniston. What's not to love there?! Both funny and lovable actors. Now, the reason why this movie has the rating that it does is because the humor in it is nothing like you've ever seen or heard before. It's a very different and unique style of humor that no one is accustomed to and so, people don't like it because it's not mainstream. As for me, it was relieving to see something original and something that actually made me laugh constantly throughout the movie. The humor thrived on its awkwardness and offbeat nature, two components I love to see in comedies but apparently not for others- hence the low rating. For instance, I lost it when Paul Rudd is trying to prep himself for sex in front of the blonde chick. I was laughing harder and harder as he kept rambling on how he was gonna do what he was gonna do that by the end, I was out of breath. The scene was so drawn out and excessively awkward but that's exactly the reason why I thought it was the funniest scene in the movie. It kind of defines the brand of humor that the movie has to offer and it's a brand that the majority doesn't appreciate. I also loved how genuine and smart the movie was too; it actually offered sophisticated insight into love, life, friendship and all those other good things. Maybe people didn't see that or they just didn't care but I like it when a movie has heart to it. Anyway, if you want to see something different, you should definitely check this movie out.

What a horribly written waste of time. How many times exactly do Paul Rudd and Jennifer Aniston plan on playing the same characters? I cannot accurately put into words how disappointed I am that I was talked into enduring this movie. Please save yourselves the misery of watching the careers of the cast slowly drown before your very eyes. Somehow its a stand-alone movie with all the quality of a straight-to-DVD sequel, and it left me full of remorse for the hour and a half I lost.",Wanderlust

This is a lousy movie, pointless, offensive to brain owners! Dialogues are creepy surreal, people shown are a bunch of fools and not a laugh is produced. The peak of gross is the birth of a kid on the porch I cannot believe I wasted my time on this crap!Final scene is predictable an hour before it happens, and final fight between main characters is so nonsense and followed by excuses so fast that you cannot believe how lame that is! Aniston reaches her lowest point, She can only rise from this!

This movie could have easily been much much better. With the nudity, it is interesting that they only showed the one middle aged man and a bunch of much older people, nude and running - very bad and unneeded) and did not show the younger women much at all.To top it off, when I saw one of the scenes (where the nudist is caring in the bags) from the trailer and noticed they actually changed the words in the trailer so they could air it at any time during the day. Cheap and again another unneeded change. If they can't show the actual wording, do 'fake' it.Redoing the wording and removing the unneeded nudity would have been very easy taken this movie into a highly rated comedy that could have easily been given a PG 17 rating rather than R. About the R, when did full frontal (and lots of it) nudity move into being an R rating. While there were no scenes where you saw people actually having sex, it should have been rated higher than an R in some way.",Wanderlust

I relate this movie to Pineapple Express or Your Highness because of it's random twists within the movie--acid trips, open sex relationships, a horse in one scene. The plot is very straightforward: marriage going down hill due to unemployment/financial issues and they go through a phase to rekindle their love. I think the humor bests fits to those who have done a commune or experienced what they experienced. I can see how viewers may not think it's funny or think its idiotic. There are some scenes that make you think ""what the heck!?. BUT because of it's edgy it-goes-there scenes, it makes the viewer stay for more. I live in San Francisco so this movie definitely can fit into some of the San Franciscans here in the city. I see it everyday. I love it! They have no worries and they're full of love.

I think I laughed once or twice and it couldn't of been that funny because I can't remember the joke and I only watched it a couple of hours ago. It is criminal that Paul Rudd is doing stuff like this he deserves a whole lot better.

Of course there is the occasional stretch for Hollywood's sake, but all in all, I don't see it as outlandish and utterly impossible to believe throughout. I could practically name hippies of Elysium after college friends and although the brother's family in Atlanta are also painted as the end-of- spectrum for their tight-ass ways, they could just be a funnier version of people I've know.",Wanderlust

There is no raunchy or even 'sexy' sex scenes, certainly less sexually-explicit images than any prime-time TV show in your own living room. Of course there is a lot of conversation about the topic, but again, there is far more explicit information on TV... Michaela Watkins is a RIOT!

Jennifer is awesome, and you can tell they had fun making this movie. There were twists and turn that totally surprised me. I pay attention to the audience as well, every where, spontaneous laughter, the nudity shocking but not offensive.

Often, this type of humor can be missed if you take the movie too seriously.Rudd and Aniston work well together with plenty of other talent in the cast you'll likely recognize.

I remember, now, why I gave up my car and house for a tent and bicycle and headed out in search of a more sustainable way of life! The sense of connection, freedom and fun that the two main characters experienced at the commune often felt like a dream life come true. From the nude grape stomping to the huge fruit and vegetable stand to the sense of vulnerability and transparency (though sometimes too much...no doors on the bathrooms? that's a little much!), Elysium Bed and Breakfast seemed like a place I would surely want to visit and would likewise find a lot of inner transformation.Though the stereotypes got a little old after awhile, as did some of the forced humorous moments, I left the theater feeling refreshed knowing that each of us can do what we love and create the life we have dreamed of.

I was the last one to walk out.. I didn't laugh once... pretty corny actually..I'm not sure what the purpose of Jennifer Anniston doing this movie was.. I think that once she sits down and watches it she will see that there really is nothing funny about this movie... even the premise is flawed.. who lives in a commune nowadays.. do the producers really expect us to believe that two city slickers from New York would pack everything up and drive down to Atlanta after losing a job?? and who in their right mind would go to a place like this anyway??This movie will go down as one of the worst of the year and the ones that reviewed it favorably and thought it was funny,well I'm not sure about them",Wanderlust
141,george2015,Below Belt Flop,5,5 March 2012,"In its earliest frames Wanderlust rips along, precision-aimed at the credit crunch generation, nervous of the future and all-too-familiar with the kind of real estate shyster who'll claim your prospective purchase is not studio but micro-loft, but once you try to sell, says it is not micro-loft, more unshiftable studio apartment.But then things meander. The leading couple George and Linda (Paul Rudd and Jennifer Aniston) end up implausibly comfortable, their days of free love and tripping at the Elysium commune concluded. Elsewhere the movie is a blur of bouncing body parts (you have to admire a production that de-clothes its entire cast, the sole exceptions allowed to stay covered being the hot young women), hippie idiocies and flecks of hypocrisy within idealism. There is sporadic laugh-out-loud brilliance of observation: the guy back in New York texting George about a (non-existent) prospective high-paying job for a prank; the new money older brother (Ken Marino) only sheltering George and Linda in order to humiliate them, and the reinvigorated attitude of the TV folks to the casino development news story once the protesters on camera have removed their bras. Is Wanderlust actually any good? Or is it just a morass of disparate comic sketches and flopping appendages? Anyone offended by nudity should steer clear, as should anyone, indeed, seeking anything either sharply meaningful or full-on searingly amusing. For Wanderlust is neither of these. It never could be: it's too comfortable in its own skin, as useless at being purposeful as a cab driver who gabbles fascinatingly but will also make you miss your plane. But yes, it is for anyone up for a chortle at hippiedom, who'll be fine with vast expanses of naked flesh, and who'll forgive the plot's unflinching lack of earnestness. Possibly the making of this flick carried overtones of something of a jokey commune - sorry, intentional community - in itself.

I especially liked the fact that everything was fair game for its brazen satire. It didn't just make a mockery of a particular lifestyle, but found humor in every setting and lifestyle in the movie. The best part about it was that it pushed boundaries in a gentle way. Yeah there was nudity, but who cares? It wasn't crass for the most part, and if you're old enough to watch an R-rated movie, you should be comfortable enough to see naked bodies of all sorts without being offended.As expected, the ending tied the story up in a nice little bow and left me feeling satisfied for the most part.

151,kspeis,"A couple is forced to choose between living under the rules of the open community they love, and forgo their materialistic ways, or, resort back to their normal lives.",7,7 September 2012,"Wanderlust is a comedic suspense film with a star-studded cast. Jennifer Aniston and Paul Rudd play a married couple in New York City, George and Linda, who are searching for happiness in all the wrong places. George is a cynical businessman at a large company who hates his job but works hard to provide for his frivolous wife. Linda is a fun-loving woman who changes her occupation more than her clothes. She describes herself as an entrepreneur who has yet to find her niche. When he gets laid off from his well-paying job and HBO declines her depressing penguin documentary, they are forced to move out of their newly purchased ""micro loft"" to go live with his wealthy, crude, brother in Georgia. A chain of events leads them to a hippy-commune-in-denial, Elysium. After the couple spends some time in the confinements of his tormenting brothers house, and then in the warm community Elysium provided they come to a hard decision. They are forced to choose between living under the rules of the open community they love, and forgo their materialistic ways, or, resort back to their normal lives. I haven't seen anything like Wanderlust. To me, the plot and levity does not match any other comedy in the past decade. However, the director, David Wain, has written and directed a plethora of movies that are similar such as The Ten and Role Models which both have similar humor and each feature Paul Rudd. I appreciate the comedy brought to light through Elysium. They light-heartedly made fun of how hippies or commies act in certain situations. They also added in all the working parts of a stereotypical commune such as: nudity, marijuana, hallucinogens, free love, and peace to animals and nature. These elements added to the humor, and surprised the audience in every scene, taking each joke to the edge of being too far. Paul Rudd does improve throughout the movie, which brought out even more laughs from the audience. At the same time they made fun of the typical hot-headed rich guy through George's extremely crude brother, Rick, played by Ken Marino, who made his fortune in the port-a-potty business. I could relate to the way materialistic wants pulls us away from what is truly important in life. After watching this movie it made me want to be a part of a commune because of the way everyone got along and how caring everyone is for each other. The other underlying theme in this film is that the sense of community can easily be destroyed when everyone is competing to have the nicer house, clothes, car, and etcetera. When Wanderlust came out in February I was convinced that Jennifer Aniston's relationship with co-star, Justin Theroux, was a publicity stunt. Now that the two are engaged it is amusing to watch their chemistry in this film and see why his brilliant comedic acting grabbed her attention.",Wanderlust

It has a lot of my favorite comic actors in it. I am pretty picky really and did find some of it rather predictable but did not mind that but I found some things to be not predictable too. Full frontal male nudity (spoiler perhaps not sure) is a bit jarring at first but it makes the movie. I guess if you have ever lived with or been around a group of people like this it makes it a little more funny. I say watch but don't expect too much and maybe you will be pleasantly surprised. Not for everyone. Lots of subtle humor that I found great. It think the characters in this movie make you uncomfortable in a lot of scenes on purpose.

153,sandyb0802,Hilarious!,10,20 January 2013,"This is more of an independent quirky film so I get why some people just don't get the humor. I would describe the humor as tongue in cheek and absurd (which is great for me and tickles my funny bone to no end). Basically it is a great cast poking fun at the hippie dippy community. I think you have to already think that kind of lifestyle is a joke in order to laugh. Personally I know people who are like those they are portraying and they are really laying it on thick. They take being all open and free and take it up a like 5 notches. I feel like if you enjoy subtle humor then this is good. Actually, to disagree with another viewer I didn't think they were trying too hard at all. I like Saturday Night Live and I think it is a little bit like that kind of humor. Poking fun at certain personalities. If you like The Big Lebowski you will probably like this. I think it was a different movie for Aniston to do and that is a good thing. I mean, Alan Alda was in it. He was also in Woody Allen movies. It's a little bit of cerebral humor because you have to be able to laugh at the stupidity. If you like Larry David you will probably like this. So for me it totally hit the spot. The humor was detailed, subtle and just perfect. Smart, well-paced and just a fun ride. Very good timing! An instant favorite for me (and that is rare!) I couldn't stop laughing. If I throw my head back, that is a good thing. And I am glad Aniston is trying different character roles. Good idea. People will get used to that eventually. Can't see her and then go ""alright! this is going to be like Friends!"" (I hated Friends, loved Seinfeld).

To find a really funny, intelligent comedy is rare and very welcome.There are some intense and somewhat ""uncomfortable"" moments but, to me, they were believable and gave the film some depth. I loved the way the characters dropped their facades in the final scenes - now that's a real ""truth-telling circle"".The juxtaposition of different cultures and personalities was written brilliantly.
