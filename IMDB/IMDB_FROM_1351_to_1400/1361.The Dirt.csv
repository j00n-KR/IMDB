0,nogodnomasters,Have a bump with me.,8,19 April 2019,"This is a biopic of rock band Motley Crue who failed to conform to the pop music of the eighties. It follows the life of all four of the members allowing them all to have their monologue and asides. The film looks head on at the sex and drugs. The band sums it up at the end by saying it was amazing that they were all still alive and not in jail. Very entertaining and well done.F-word, sex, nudity.",The Dirt
1,paul_haakonsen,This definitely is The Dirt...,8,27 March 2019,"Sure, I have been listening to metal for the better part of 30 years, and of course Mötley Crüe has been among the bands that I listened to. And sure, I knew that there has been controversy around the band, just never bothered to catch up on what the controversy was.Then I found ""The Dirt"" on Netflix, and decided to watch it immediately. There was no hesitation, this was definitely a movie that needed to be watched. Sure, I had a little bit of worry about what it would be like - I mean, a movie based on a metal band.I am very glad that I sat down to watch ""The Dirt"", because not only does it offer an amazing insight into the story behind the glam rock band, in terms of their career, their individual ambitions, their lifestyles, and how becoming rock stars affected them, but it also turns out that ""The Dirt"" is a very entertaining movie.The movie has a very interesting ensemble of cast for the lead rockers; Colson Baker playing Tommy Lee, Douglas Booth playing Nicki Sixx, Daniel Webber playing Vince Neil and Iwan Rheon playing Mick Mars. These four really carried the movie so well individually and together on the screen. I think a lot of research has gone into the individual characters prior to shooting the movie, because it really seemed like they nailed the performances of the real band members.""The Dirt"" was entertaining from the very beginning and up to the end. And it definitely was a rollercoaster of emotions, ranging from hardcore party to sadness, loss and heartache. I was thoroughly entertained by this movie, and was initially settling on a 7 out of 10 rating, but I am upping it to 8, because this movie is a MUST watch for fans of Mötley Crüe.",The Dirt
2,Calicodreamin,Good Docudrama,8,21 April 2019,"Very interesting movie!
Enjoyed the cinema style, with the narration by each character and the look into the camera moments.
Music was awesome. Would recommend.",The Dirt
3,Wuchakk,One of the most entertaining music biopics ever made (but also nastiest),9,23 March 2019,"RELEASED IN 2019, ""The Dirt"" is a biography of Mötley Crüe from their inception in the early 80s to the mid-90s. Along with GnR, the band was the cream of the crop of 80's hair metal. They were notorious for their childish, debauched antics and the movie depicts this from the get-go with an off-putting bit o' raunch at a party. There's also an amusing pool sequence that gets pretty repellent with Ozzy pathetically trying to prove how ""crazy"" he was (I heard the curious story long ago so I was prepared for it).If you can handle that, this is one of the best band biopics in cinema; and more so if you favor Crüe's music. The movie has a sense of humor and includes a little parody; it's fun, dynamic, stirring and sometimes vile, but also dramatic and even moving, especially in the last act. A plus is that most of the characters have a story arc wherein they learn from their misdeeds and mature.The flick was based on drummer Tommy Lee's autobiography ""The Dirt: Confessions of the World's Most Notorious Rock Band,"" as well as the biographies of other band members & Co. So, while there's an over-the-top feel here and there, the events really happened with minor alterations for dramatic effect.The best way to rate a biopic is to compare it to others, including fictional ones loosely based on real-life characters, like ""Rock Star"" (2001) and ""The Rose"" (1979). As decent as those two are, ""The Dirt"" is all-around more entertaining. It's also superior to ""Walk the Line"" (2005), the slanderous ""The Doors"" (1991), the underrated ""The Perfect Age of Rock 'n' Roll"" (2009), ""Eddie and the Cruisers"" (1983) and ""The Runaways"" (2010). I'd put it on par with ""Coal Miner's Daughter"" (1980), but it's very different because the style of music and subculture is so radically different. Content-wise, it's closest to ""Rock Star,"" ""The Runaways"" and ""The Perfect Age of Rock 'n' Roll,"" but funner than the brooding latter.Douglas Booth is convincing as Nikki Sixx, the band leader/bassist/composer and so is Machine Gun Kelly as the hyperactive, but genial Tommy Lee. Iwan Rheon is also effective as the more mature and subdued guitarist Mick Mars. Daniel Webber unfortunately lacks the looks of singer Vince Neil, but is otherwise effective.THE MOVIE RUNS 1 hour, 47 minutes and was shot in Los Angeles and New Orleans.GRADE: A",The Dirt
4,trashgang,a must see,10,28 March 2019,"Growing up in the heydays of Motley Crew of course I was aware of all their shocking things they did in hotels and on tour, I knew their use of alcohol and drugs and even as I wasn't into their genre when I saw th etrailer for The Dirt on Netflix I wanted to see it immediately.Must say, some things I didn't knew (Skylar) and even watching it with the knowledge I still had a WTF or a laugh on my face. It even goes over the top, and based on true events you just can't believe it, the blowjob girl for example.The way the story is told with statements told towards the camera it makes it easy to swallow. Here and there you will here some music but the way the acting was done is top notch. And at the end you will see clips of the movie compared with the real Motley Crew and yes, they did look the same or did the same moves.Just sit back, grap your Daniels with you and enjoy, drugs, freedom, a lot of nudity and some sadness here and there. I liked it.

5,jack_o_hasanov_imdb,4th Wall and Mötley Crüe,7,28 August 2021,"Mötley Crüe is one of the bands I listen to.I wasn't expecting such a movie, it was fun.As funny as it may seem, it is actually their tragicomic story.The casting wasn't good, a better cast could have made the movie better.But it was still interesting to listen to the Mötley Crüe music while watching their life, even if it was terrible. The fall of the 4th wall made the movie even more fun.P. S : Ozzy was great ;)",The Dirt
6,capone666,The Vidiot Reviews...,6,4 April 2019,"The DirtEighties hair bands never had to worry about the Me Too movement because everyone thought they were women.Fortunately, any relationships the band in this biography had with their groupies appeared consensual.When drummer Tommy Lee (Colson Baker) gets word his favourite band has disbanded, he propositions the bass player, Nikki Six (Douglas Booth), to form a new group with him. After securing guitarist Mick Mars (Iwan Rheon) and cover band singer Vince Neil (Daniel Webber) the foursome become Mötley Crüe. Eventually landing a record deal and garnering a few hits, the glam rockers implode due to drugs.Focusing mainly on the sex and debauchery, this montage filled adaptation of the band's notorious memoirs never goes beyond their sorted tales. Meanwhile, the acting is pitiable, the dialogue laughable and the lessons learned are contrived.And while groupies still exist, nowadays they have to sleep with the dead lead singer's hologram. Red Lightvidiotreviews.blogspot.ca",The Dirt
7,digitalbeachbum,OK but a partial truth,4,26 March 2019,"Having followed the band for many years since my high school days, this short biopic is a diluted pile of poop. There is too many moments, people, events and stories skipped or dropped because of either legal or personal reasons. The death of Hanoi Rocks' Razzle was an example of being watered down and the lack of Pamela Anderson shows that the director or the band wanted to hide certain things. I thought it was amusing but given their lack of memories, lost brain cells and the need to hide the truth I had to downgrade my rating. I found the production OK, but it isn't exactly The Dirt.",The Dirt
8,arfdawg-1,Horrible and Stoopid,1,4 May 2019,"This movie is just horrible and the good reviews are phonyThis makes Bohenian Rapsody look like Citizen Kane.Acting sucks.
Writing is atrocious and the direction is non-existent.",The Dirt
9,gwnightscream,Good Rock Bio-Drama!,7,31 March 2019,"This 2019 drama is based on the life of notorious, rock band, ""Motley Crue"" through the eyes of Nikki Sixx and his experiences with band members, Vince Neil, Mick Mars and Tommy Lee from the band's forming to semi-departure, wild tour moments, drug & alcohol addictions and tragic/complicated relationships. This is a good bio-drama featuring a decent cast and the film has some shocking, humorous and heartfelt moments. I recommend this, even if you're not really a fan of the group.",The Dirt
10,subxerogravity,Sex drugs and Crue!,8,26 March 2019,"It was outstanding as far as I'm concern. Hard to say which is better Bohemian Rhapsody or the Dirt.Not really, actually. Rhapsody focuses on how epic the music of Queen is while the Dirt focus on how epic the band is, which I think is a better concept. I already am aware of the music that the Crue does so I wanted to know them.
It was high octane and full of energy from beginning to end and it Pulls no punches on what what the Crue is.Telling the story of the band as a narrative, I'm a little surprise how much the movie shares stories and info from their episode of Behind the Music. As surprising as I was of how amazing a Tommy Lee Machine Gun Kelly was.In comparison some of the events seem out of place, but the timeline they used help to cram all of the stories into a two hour film, and they have a lot of stores.It's a very MTV fast pace music video like film. Perfect for the Crue. Although this met that the actual music suffered.I feel like if you liked Queen, Boheman Rhapsody made you love the music. The Dirt made me love Crue more but thank god I already love the music cause it did little to make me love the music more.What the Dirt has over Rhapsody is that the Dirt does treat the Crue as a complete band. Each member has a bigger than life personality. Even Mick Mars who is portrayed as a grumpy old timer compared to the others. Boheman only saught to make Freddie Mercury's portail by Remi Malick Oscar worthy.So, I give it to the Dirt. It's not going to make any new fans for Motley Crue's music but it captures more of what the entire band was than bohemian Rhapsody did for Queen. Too bad, Crue's no longer acceptable behavior means it's dobutful this film is going to get an Oscar.",The Dirt
11,truemythmedia,"Good, not Great",6,8 August 2019,"The Dirt doesn't quite live up to its name, but it's definitely the better of the two rock biopics we've gotten in the past year. The story has heart even though it's an uneven mess, often finding itself funnier than it actually is, but that's not to say that their isn't some genuine laughs. Strong performances are what this movie heavily relies on and it was safe to do so, each one internally becoming a member of Motley Crue. The concert scenes are fun and energetic, giving a solid salute to the rockers. The drama is there and unfolds in a predictable manner, but it's still refreshing to see a band embracing their young idiocy and telling their story of debauchery to the world, even if it doesn't have nearly enough grit as its title would suggest. I give The Dirt 3 out of 5 stars.",The Dirt
12,AudioFileZ,Feeling Dirty Just For Watching,7,22 March 2019,"This movie answered a question I never thought to ask: can you feel dirty, and riddled with guilt along with embarrassment, by watching something? I'd have to say yes after seeing ""The Dirt"". First, the positive. The actors cast as the members of Motley Crue do more than an admirable job playing their parts. They really seem like they could be the actual band never missing in scenes requiring playing their instruments and being over the edge in each member's unique personality. There's constant use of humor to soften the, well, dirt. Wisely the director knew this kind of depravity couldn't be shown without it. Then there's that part that hovers and it is an attempt to not candy coat the totally out of control way the band existed for over a decade. It's often vile. I am no prude yet it made me uncomfortable just watching often prompting a FFW in attempt not to be a sick voyeur.Simply put this story, and film, isn't for general consumption. It's a version of Spinal Tap that is all too graphically real - with terrible tragedy because of being real. If there was a band that was worse in behavior it's impossible to imagine. And that, I guess, is where this film sits. I don't particularly like their music, but that wasn't the point. It's just what it is and the title certainly fits.",The Dirt
13,michaeltrivedi,Just Keep Reading,7,24 September 2019,"The Dirt. Oh what oh what could I say about The Dirt.When I watched it for the first time, I thought this could be the greatest movie ever made. And that's really saying a lot in my book. The second time I watched it, I thought it is a mediocre movie at best.I really enjoy rock star movies. There are far too many of them, but this one is really fun. I guess Motley Crue was a crazy party band back in the day, and this film builds on that and goes in all directions. It's an unpredictable movie. And Machine Gun Kelly is EXCELLENT as Tommy Lee.I would HIGHLY RECOMMEND you watching this movie. Go watch it. Now. Stop reading. GO. NOW!7 stars",The Dirt
14,joebloggscity,Glam metal hell-raising - Somehow Motley Crue survived to tell the tale!,6,17 May 2021,"Motley Crue are an old favourite of people from a certain generation, but from the off I'll say they weren't my cup of tea. However, they were a wild band from the old hair metal days, a period of style that is likely to never come back. So what we have here is a paen to those old days, of riotous debauchery and hell-raising with some crazy tunes throw in.This homage to Motely Crue is a warts & all biopic of the band, and there's a hell of a lot of warts. The band never tries to make any apologies for their behaviour, and they were amongst the worst behaved in a time long before the woke movement. Sexist, mysogynistic, drug taking, myopic, selfish and drunk - these guys lived life to the max, and the hotels took the brunt of the damage as much as their bodies. The film takes us from the beginning thru the worst excesses and dramas to the inevitable turning point where they had to stop the excesses.Surprisingly fascinating even though I'd never wish to ever be in their company to be honest.The style of the film is a bit Spinal Tap and cartoonish, which makes sense as the band were never ones to take themselves too seriously. A rough and ready act with an explosive stage performance, they just laughed and partied through their heyday, and there were no shortage of fans (esp women) along for the ride.Just think of it like this. Take the most hedonistic lifestyle possible in rock n roll, and you're getting the idea of what these guys were like. Doesn't shy from the worst parts (e.g. Heroin addiction), but at least is honest. I found it fun to watch although uncomfortable for that too, as I'd never follow suit with them.For a fun retrospective on the old 1980s glam metal days, you'll find little which is more fun to watch. Not a lifestyle for me, but I'm happy that these guys somehow survived the journey.",The Dirt
15,Rob-O-Cop,write your own history,3,28 March 2019,"A not very good band writes their own history and still manages to make themselves look bad.
A band known for their bad hair look ridiculous with the ill-fitting wigs and straight off the costume departments racks wardrobe to make a not particularly sympathetic story even more unrelatable.
They tried to paint out the obviously dodgy behaviour toward women but they still came off as creeps. I don't know if there really was a good story here to tell of if this is just more of America painting it's trash on screen and pretending it's something to celebrate. Fails on 2 levels, the story and the execution.",The Dirt
16,kjproulx,"The Title Says it All, in a Good Way",7,22 March 2019,"Biopics revolving around classic bands have definitely become a fad these days, even though they have been around for decades. The Dirt is the latest in the long line of musical biopics and this time it's hitting Netflix. As Mötley Crüe isn't exactly one of the greatest bands of all time to many people, their music has absolutely resonated with many listeners. Not knowing anything about the lives of these four men before going in, I'm pleasantly surprised that this story had a lot more to offer than the average biopic. Still, it does follow the tired formula, but that's okay, because it's done quite well here.Following Nikki Sixx, Vince Neil, Tommy Lee, and Mick Mars as they form an unlikely group of misfits, this band quickly shoots to superstardom, which ultimately leads to a life of sex, drugs, and rock n' roll. This premise has been done to death through the years, so the only thing to truly keep you interested in movies like this is the content itself. From car accidents to overdosing, this is a film that keeps you engaged from start to finish. Sadly, the material presented throughout the majority of the film is quite unlikeable, to say the least.You can't help but be disgusted by the actions of most of these men, but the music and shocking turn of events is why you watch movies like this, so for that reason, it all blends together quite well. Still, many viewers will be turned off by this film in the first five minutes, guaranteed. If you're in for a wild ride with sometimes disturbing imagery, bordering on pornography or actual footage of heroin overdosing, then I think you'll enjoy the movie for what it is. When watching this film, it became clear to me why this film never hit theatres, but that's not because it was bad by any means.Although Vince (the lead singer) is played up as the most unlikeable character throughout the majority of the film, Daniel Webber gave a terrific performance. I would love to see his career explode more than it already has, because I believe he has some real dramatic talent, just waiting to be showcased. On top of that, Iran Rheon is the most likeable actor here and Douglas Booth as Nikki Sixx was great as well. Surprisingly, the breakout performance here is actually from Machine Gun Kelly (Colson Baker). I never would have expected that, but his devotion to this character was a joy to watch.In the end, The Dirt is absolutely defined by its title, because this is a film that showcases the grit and griminess of the rock n' roll underworld. That aspect alone will turn viewers off, but it's a very well-made movie nonetheless. This is by no means one of the better biopics out there, but it's an enjoy film and better than a lot of the content Netflix has been making, in terms of feature films. To fans of Mötley Crüe or fans of a good biopic in general, I would recommend checking this one out. It's fairly standard fare with some surprisingly elements throughout.",The Dirt
17,maccas-56367,The wait was worth it!,9,22 March 2019,"""The Dirt"" Drinking Game: take a shot of Jack Daniels whenever you hear the words ""dude"", ""man"" or ""chicks"". Take a shot for each bare breast you see. Check yourself into rehab 1.5 hours later.I had been waiting to see this film for 12 years - ever since 17-year-old-me first read ""The Dirt"". It doesn't disappoint. In fact, it was way more enjoyable and fun than I thought it would be. It's cringeworthy, cheesy as hell and over-the-top - but then so is 80s rock. ""The Dirt"" seems self-aware of this though and doesn't take itself too seriously. It regularly breaks that fourth wall to hilarious effect.It's basically a comedy with a side of debauchery, partying and drug addiction. Oh and there's occasionally some awesome music thrown in too. It follows the four band member narratives just like in the book - and it works. I came away with Mick Mars having become my new favourite member of Mötley Crüe. I feel they got the personalities dead-on.Given the length of the book, this rollercoaster felt like it was over all too soon. Still, it was fun while it lasted - much like the career of Motley itself. Go into this with an open mind, don't take it too seriously and just enjoy the ride.Most fun I've had watching a movie in ages. I'm off to go spin my copy of ""Dr Feelgood"" now!",The Dirt
18,cardsrock,I wish they went further with it,6,14 April 2019,"For a film depicting some of the craziest people and moments in the history of rock and roll, it sure does play it safe. The Dirt is a pretty formulaic rock biopic about the notorious Motley Crue. As a fan of the band, I was definitely interested in seeing their debauchery detailed on film. While there is some fun to be had enjoying the music and craziness, the movie just doesn't go far enough in covering their absurd exploits. There's too much condensed into too small of a window. Machine Gun Kelly is perfectly cast as Tommy Lee and the rest of the cast is decent. I wish that the filmmakers put a little more effort into realistically showcasing the story of such an infamous band.",The Dirt
19,Beejerman,JEER - (4 stars out of 10),4,7 April 2019,"The stage curtains open ...It pains me to have to write this review as I've followed Mötley Crüe since the very beginning. I had all their albums, starting with cassette tapes - knew all the band members names, followed them individually over the years and have seen them live in concert too many times to count. I was a Crüe fan.The film's story begins in the early 80's as the newly formed band was just getting started in L.A. It takes us through some of their growing pains, hedonistic lifestyle, drug and alcohol abuse, relationships they've had, and the songs that they recorded and performed over the years. Culminating with the departure of Vince Neil along with the death of his little girl, Skylar - and his eventual return.As I was watching this movie, I was so disappointed in it - and that's why it pains me. I desperately wanted to come in here and leave a glowing review, but I just couldn't. This is NOT the Mötley Crüe story. It acknowledges certain things that happened to them over the years, but it in no way gives us the true story behind the band. The film felt cursory and serviceable to me. There is no depth to it, giving us shallow acting and therefore, generic characterizations of these 4 very high profile and colorful individuals.The film about the most decadent of all metal bands (like EVER) actually seemed tame to me. The whole how-they-meet aspect is skewed as well as how they tried to push their cheesy, ""we love you, Vince"", reunion scene on us makes them like every other band out there. No. We're talking about Mötley Crüe - and that is not how it went.I cannot and do not recommend this film. So much about what defined this band was left completely out of the picture: Tommy Lee & Pamela Anderson, the whole Axl Rose & Vince Neil altercation, their struggles after their reunion and ensuing albums ... just to name a few. It gets 4 stars for the music, including the new tracks recorded for this movie. But, this is not a film to remember this awesome band by.(Oh yes, and I DO remember Ratt. LOL - Are you kidding me? Who doesn't? There was a time when Ratt was much bigger than Mötley Crüe was).",The Dirt

22,bgar-80932,Entertaining,8,7 April 2019,I know the major hits from Motley Crue but never really cared about them. For this movie that doesn't matter at all. This was a fun movie. It's got a good cast that resembles the actual band and is well acted all around. This didn't feel like two hours at all and I wasn't once tempted to check my phone which is a big deal these days. It does a good job showing the party lifestyle of rockers with all the ups and downs. Enjoyable flick. Not going to win any Oscars or be a big replay candidate but I def recommend it.,The Dirt
23,danielmanson,Review from a neutral and not a huge fan of the band,7,27 March 2019,"I watched this film simply because I liked the look of it on Netflix. I knew about Motley Crue, but that's about it. Vast majority of these reviews are from die hard fans and fans of the book (didn't even know there was a book)I thought it was pretty good, it isn't on Bohemian Rhapsody level whatsoever, but it's definitely worth a watch.Although I do feel as though certain parts felt rushed, I overall gained an appreciation of the band and their music. The narration and talking to the camera here and there is different but I personally felt it worked well with the storytelling. The comparisons between the ""characters"" and the real life band members was really cool to see as well.So yeah, I think it's worth watching from a neutral point of view. If you are a huge fan and didn't like the film, please don't crucify me.",The Dirt
24,funtasticfour,Am I becoming addicted to band stories now?,8,22 March 2019,"Bohemian Rhapsody was good, but I've never really been a big fan of Queen. Same goes for Motley Crue, who I feel closer to because I lived in the 80's. Both have some great music, that I've listened to casually and enjoyed. And both of these movies tell peoples stories very well. I didn't know a lot, but I'd heard about how crazy and chaotic Motley were, and this is pretty much how I imagined it. Insanely drunk, tons of drugs and women, plus trashing stuff just because they can. Some of it is hard to watch, but there are a lot of real moments in there too. Everyone has a story to tell, and I'd like to see similar movies for groups I was more into.",The Dirt

The problem with the Dirt is it feels like Spinal Tap like its making fun of itself.The slick editing and face pace didn't save it. It was all f this girl and f that girl etc. This was not a glamorous look at a band. Far from it. It was almost made by someone who hated the band or wanted to make fun of them.They were portrayed as crude idiots. Half the stuff wasn't believable, it was so over the top and in an unnecessary way. Ozzy snorting ants, licking his own pee? Really? Even if any of this actually happened, which seemed suspect, it made them look like losers. Reckless idiots thatDid we need every scene to be a snorting coke scene? No. It was like they wrote three scenes and repeated them for 2 hours.There was ZERO interesting character layers that made me connected to any of them.Tommy Lee was miscast and came off as a total moron.Get the facts right.

28,Marynewcomb2013,Nope!!!,1,22 March 2019,"I have been a Cure fan since the beginning & this movie stinks!!! Don't listen to the positive reviews because those people are not true fans and they surly have not read the book!!
The narration was completely uncalled for but the actors!! If you are going to do that, get the real band members to do it!! The actors pulled off the antics but as being a preforming band, SUCK!! They couldn't even pretend to play right!! During Shout, the actor playing Mick was not even moving his fingers on the strings during the solo!!
When they were first forming, Kelly is wearing a Hulkamaina shirt & that did not hit until about three years later!! Vince's car wreak was not in a Vette!! When the wreak first happens in the film, the right rear gets hit but when you see the car from the right side, the whole side is destroyed!! They couldn't even make that tragic moment look right!!
Not just the wreak they messed up but when Nikki overdosed they messed up!! He checks out of the hospital, goes back to his hotel room & shoots up in the bathroom, NOT THE CLOSET!!!
The one thing they did get right was Skyler in the hospital & that was one of the only two parts that were good and accurate!! That did bring tears to my eyes like the book did. The only other good part in the movie was the end credits when you saw the REAL band!!
One last thing, they couldn't even get the Ozzy part right!! None of that happened at the pool, it was on SIDEWALKS!!!
I know people will not like my review and I don't really care!! It just shows those are not actual fans of this once great band!! This film has killed what the legacy of this band hand!!",The Dirt

32,ferdmalenfant,Surprisingly Good,8,28 May 2019,I wasn't expecting much at all from this docu-drama but was amazed at just how good the actors were and the story was extremely endearing. As a teenager of the 80's I was aware of the Crue but had no idea just how bad things got. Very much worth watching.,The Dirt
33,bryangary65,Honest memories,7,5 April 2019,"Must admit did not know a lot about Motley Crue before watching this film.Got to say though their music was pretty good. As for the movie it appears to be a all warts and no filter description of the bands journey togetherSome of it is a bit distasteful, but a lot of it is how you would expect a young rock and roll band to behave when they reach the top",The Dirt
34,Donatien3,Full on and Fun Debauchery,9,25 March 2019,"Most music biopics follow a familiar formula: famous frontman joins band, said band becomes giant success, are lured by the perks of fame which eventually cause their downfall (insert problem with drugs/sex/alcohol/ego power plays) and a quick rehab trip before a triumphant reunion.While ""The Dirt"" follows those beats, it's still entertaining. Based on the book of the same name (and featuring Vince Neil, Tommy Lee, Mick Mars and Nikki Six as co-producers), this film feels authentic, with enough drug use (which can get a bit explicit, so be warned), sex (lots of nudity here - both male and female), alcoholism, hotel room trashings and general debauchery to do eighties Hair Metal proud.As a Netflix special, ""The Dirt"" has more freedom than a 'mainstream' biopic (like ""Bohemian Rhapsody""), mixing its explicitness with a few fourth-wall-breaking nods to the audience; though it does get dramatic towards the end when the debauchery (and a family tragedy) finally takes its toll, it feels natural.The soundtrack is great, a combination of Crue studio recordings and in-film versions.Even if you've never been a Crue fan, you'll still enjoy this movie.",The Dirt
35,Emerenciano,"Great band, great movie",8,31 March 2019,"I have always liked Mötley Crüe and that was great to see this film. The plot may be shocking for many people, but i see it as a real pictire of what happened in the scene in the 80's. Another ting to note is the soundtrack. Great!!!",The Dirt
36,dk77dk,The Dirt : On With The Show,9,3 November 2021,"It is almost unbelievable that this film has been made nowadays. A film that refrains from nothing, excessive, loud, obscene, offensive and completely entertaining.The film follows the band and its somewhat bizarre members and their lives, ups and downs. The film does not lack explicit scenes, but anything less than that would be a complete failure, because this is a story about the eighties and the band that left a mark in that decade, they simply slowly became a legend.The casting is perfect, the actors not only look like Motley Crue, but they managed to evoke the personality of those characters.When such a good casting is done, the film immediately gets great potential if the director knows how to use it. And the director Jeff Tremaine made great use of this acting potential and made an interesting and entertaining film.Motley Crue is a fun band, you don't have to be a fan of theirs to enjoy the movie, because the movie is really fun, and that's the first rule of the movie, that it has to entertain the viewer. It's something many filmmakers today forget and make boring and tedious movies instead of giving us good fun.The costume design is excellent and shows us a window into the look and feel of the eighties, it can be seen that a lot of effort has been put into it. We follow the development of events from the very beginning, the ups and downs through good music and excellent cinematography.A fun and interesting film work with an excellent cast.",The Dirt
37,patriciogl10,"More rock biopics like this, please.",8,16 May 2019,"I was excited to see this, and it did not disappoint. It's such a fun movie, you get to see the beginnings of Mötley Crüe and their rise to the top. It's their story told through the visual representation of their autobiography by the band themselves and Neil Strauss; and they did a pretty good job. The actors were fantastic in their roles, it was like watching them fool around back in the 80s. Douglas Booth, Iwan Rheon, Daniel Webber and Machine Gun Kelly portray their roles pretty well, they had great chemistry together and it truly felt like they were the actual band in their heyday. They probably took some artistic license regarding some particular facts, which doesn't really bother me.I thoroughly enjoyed The Dirt, and it seems like a lot of people did. I hope Hollywood continues to make more rock band biopics. This had its cliché moments and whatnots, but it totally worked. Several dramatic moments are on-point, such as the ones Vince Neil and Nikki Sixx went through. I believe that the movie has to do the music justice, because people who already knew about Crüe already love the awesome music, so it's only fair that the film corresponds with that awesomeness. Which it does.",The Dirt
38,jamesjustice-92,Dirt under make-up,7,7 April 2019,"The Dirt suffers from the same syndrom as Bohemian Rhapsody did: inconsistency. The movie looks rough around the ages, one event flows into another and it feels like this big story that Motley Crue really had to say was more of a summary of those events. He did that - that led to this - we had that done - we realized that - so this is who we are now thanks: maybe I don't know anything about making biopics but that's not how a good movie works; you have to put the movie through the lens of self-perception and empathy and I just couldn't do it. Not because a life of a rock star is alien to me but because the characters - who are supposed to be real people - are not developed enough to show a clear picture (except for Nikki Sixx who has more than two lines of background story and more screen time, as was with Bohemian Rhapsody). But overall I enjoyed the movie very much and all those crazy things they'd done too. Needless to say that the soundtrack is great and new songs from it kickass as always; the camera work is remarkable, especially the scenes shot in the first-person perspective. The actors are giving their best to be Motley Crue and they succeed. But the whole movie is nearly a recollection of main events played against the music by one of the greatest bands of all time so it's better to leave it to ears to perceive.",The Dirt
39,tfminfl,In the Beginning...,10,27 March 2019,"321. The Dirt. A fantastic movie about the best fu**ing band to grace the Earth... Motley Crue. From their crazy start way back in '81, to snorting ants with Ozzy, to vehicular manslaughter, and even back from death. Kick ass music and a lots of naked boobies. Machine Gun Kelly became Tommy Lee, it was crazy! Thanks to my brother Bill for introducing me to the Crue, for my say 9th or 10th birthday, he gave me a duo of relics called cassette tapes, one Quiet Riots 'Condition Critical' and the other Motley Crue's 'Shout at the Devil'. A fan was born that day!! Nikki, Tommy, Vince and Mick... you guys rock!! Filmbufftim on FB",The Dirt
40,Eddie_weinbauer,Needed more decadence & debauchery,5,23 March 2019,"It's not completely true to the book,but scratches the surface.
It manage to be entertaining but, sadly it moves too fast trough what was the peak of motleys career=The 80s.
They should've have lingered way longer on the sunset strip scene, with all the bands struggling for record deal and their big break through.
They also completely leave out the part were Nikki,steals a guitar. Guess they were afraid of future lawsuits. I really felt that should've been in there, along with Rock for peace,in Moscow. They could have showed some of the old footage from it at least.
Which brings me to part of the problem
They completely leave out Rock for Peace in Moscow, which was a huge deal both in history and music. They leave out that they got kicked of the tour with kiss,cause of their behavior. The fight between Vince & Axle
There is just so much material left out, that it end up feeling like a lifetime/hallmark movie instead of the rock'n roll lifestyle movie it should've been.
Mick Mars is made into a bitter old caricature, that sleeps with his arms across his chest in vampire style(each palm touches the other shoulder)They way it is now, it comes off like a cross between Netflix and hallmark.
They also forget to age the band. They change their look a bit ,to symbolize they are older, that is all. Yet their record label guy,keep looking like a school boy, all through the movie.Even though several years gone by.But it still manage to be entertaining enough, for the most part of the duration of the movie.
The actors look the part, just good enough, that you'll let it slide that it's not the real crue. But I still feel they should've included a lot more stuff. It feels like a race to show em as the mellow people they are today,more than a movie about Crue's history & how they got thereAlso it seemed to revolve a lot! around Sixx, an scarse little the rest of the band.
Sure you get the obligatory thrashing hotel rooms, naked groupies,sex in the bathroom. Etc. but they have let out a lot that would make it better and more solid. Like Crue being the one who gave GNR their first concert tour,by letting em be the warm up band for them( I seem to recall from the book)
They should've made it into a tv series instead. Case this feels way too rushed
But I still give em 5 stars.",The Dirt
41,RhapsodyReviews,Interesting and Entertaining.,8,11 November 2019,"Review:
'The Dirt' is a biographical-drama film directed by Jeff Tremaine.
I would put this movie on the list with Bohemian Rhapsody. I say that is a way that Bohemian Rhapsody may be a better movie, especially the on-stage music scenes Bohemian definitely excels. However, that movie was made for the theatres and this movie wasn't, I think they made a really good choice making this a Netflix movie. It works so well.
This movie is exactly what the title and synopsis say. It's the story of how Mötley Crüe came to be and what followed once they were. I watched this last night and I was very surprised with what I was watching. I don't know much about Mötley Crüe having grown up in the 90s, but I certainly want to read The Dirt now I've seen the film.
The performances all around were great. Douglas Booth as Nikki Sixx, Iwan Rheon as Mick Mars, Daniel Webber as Vince Neil and even Machine Gun Kelly as Tommy Lee. Although Vince is played up as the most unlikeable character throughout the film, Daniel Webber gave a terrific performance. On top of that, Iwan Rheon is the most likeable actor here and Douglas Booth as Nikki Sixx was great as well. Surprisingly, the breakout performance here is actually from Machine Gun Kelly. I never would have expected that, but his devotion to this character was a joy to watch.
You can't help but be disgusted by the actions of most of these men, but the music and shocking turn of events is why you watch movies like this, so for that reason, it all blends together quite well. Still, many viewers will be turned off by this film in the first five minutes, guaranteed. If you're in for a wild ride with sometimes disturbing imagery, bordering on pornography or actual footage of heroin overdosing, then I think you'll enjoy the movie for what it is.
Overall, this movie shocked me in many ways and made me want to learn more about the band Mötley Crüe. I was entertained the whole time and can recommend highly.

42,PCT1970,Tremaine Is The Perfect Fit To Showcase The Crue,8,16 May 2019,"When I found out Jeff Tremaine was going to helm this film, I thought to myself there couldn't be a better fit due to his sensibility and his involvement with 'Big Brother Magazine' as well as the ""Jackass"" franchise. He does not disappoint. This is one of the very best docudramas / biopics in recent memory adapted from the book, ""The Dirt: Confessions Of The World's Most Notorious Rock Band"". The film covers the book closely and captures as much of the material that is possible, in a film less than two hours long. This viewer has seen the band live twice in my lifetime and is a life long fan. Setting that biased information aside this film includes excellent direction, cinematography, screenplay, soundtrack, costume and settings. The acting is not superb, but the actors do their very best to portray four of the most diabolical bandmates in rock history. However I will say MGK does portray a spot on Tommy Lee. The plot is set in 1980's Los Angeles and initially takes the viewer on the journey of how the band was formed including the naming of the most notorious rock band ever Motley Crue. From there we see the band make their way through all the clubs on the strip including such venues as the Whiskey a Go Go. After conquering the strip the band is offered it's first record deal and then sign on a manager. From there the madness of the Crue begins. Having more money in life than they know what to do with and the fame that comes with it, the outrageous debauchery that follows is sometimes hilarious, maddening, despicable, raunchy and sad. Reaching worldwide stardom the band goes through the highs and lows of the music industry which includes regretful behavior, addiction, egotism, love, friendships, death and much much more. One of the main themes learned is that these four men were not diabolical after all. They are just human beings, like them or not. They are four men that saw their opportunity, seized it by the proverbial b*lls and made their dream come true. The plot is crisp, clever, witty, loving, graphic, heart wrenching and captivating. Given there is dramatization in the film and having read the book, this viewer can believe most of the events are accurate and some of the live footage at the end leans towards confirming it. Although it's been over four years since the Crue's last performances their legend rocks on. This is a memorable film, a work of art and one of the very best in it's genre.",The Dirt
43,welhof1,Faced paced entertainment!,8,21 March 2020,This really rocked. Long time Crue fan and this did not disappoint. Every scene was interesting and awesome. There were literally no slow parts in the movie. I would check the time left and get sad when I knew it was close to being over.The bad. It was just too darn fast. They sped through or skipped so many parts of the bands history. It should have been a 5 part mini series with different eras in the bands history. They just left so much out it had me wanting more.Definite watch if you're a rock fan and most definitely if you're a Crue fan.,The Dirt
44,howboutthisone_huh,surprise package,8,23 March 2019,"I wasn't going to watch this movie. I'm not a fan, didn't read the book and every time I watch one of these self-obsessed biopics about aging celebrities I feel a bit envious but mostly uncomfortable about wanting to know something about somebody who is not family or friend, never met, and maybe never want to know. In recent years there's been a string of biopics, mostly about musicians, and they're almost always the same. Difficult or unusual childhood, unusual talent, struggle, almost instant fame and then difficulties being a celebrity and with having a long successful career. And this movie is a cliche but it's not. It's over the top, it's funny, not too serious and I don't see these guys portrayed as either villains or heroes. Great writing, casting, production and everything. I don't get some of the reviews here. 'depravity?' In my view, depravity is persecuting people of your own kind and then trying to exterminate them. Doing weird things to get attention and stand apart within a family is not depravity in my opinion. And either is doing things so you can mate; it's the biological order of the planet. Okay, getting your friend killed while driving drunk is a serious issue but how many of us voted for people in political office that were convicted of drunk driving (or should have been)? The only thing that bothers me about motley crue is that celebrities like this tend to influence others while ironically portraying characters that are supposed to be non-conformists. So pay attention kids and don't drive if you've been drinking or using drugs. And try not to hurt yourself or others. And remember, they're only rock n roll stars.",The Dirt
45,highmarksreviews,"Sex, Drugs and Rock N' Roll",6,30 March 2019,"To be completely honest, I have never heard one Mötley Crüe song or followed their apparently controversial tours. Understandably, heading into Netflix's latest biopic about an unknown band to me was tough, but I so wanted to like this film because of the significance it had. Having said that, I can only critique this feature from a filmmaking standpoint. ""The Dirt"" shocked, disgusted, touched and entertained me during its bumpy ride. It was as wild and out of control as the band it brought to life.Let's start with what I liked. The cast was absolutely astounding. Douglas Booth, Machine Gun Kelly, Daniel Webber and Iwan Rheon all turned in excellent performances as the respective members of Mötley Crüe. The best part was that I got to know each member just enough, without the film ever choosing to focus on one singular member. Sure, Nikki Sixx's story arc was the dominant one in the end, but the proper care was given to each and every character for me to care. The supporting cast may have failed to make a lasting impression, but I appreciated David Costabile tackling such a limited role as band manager. He left a good mark here. Perhaps the best moment that almost brought me to tears was Daniel Webber's Vince Neil sharing a brief conversation with his daughter in the hospital. I won't forget that scene.The music was great too, having heard all these songs for the first time, I will definitely be checking them out in the future. For the few times the movie showed the band performing for more than two minutes, the flashy colours and roaring audience added decent atmosphere. Tommy Lee (Machine Gun Kelly) also had a memorable drug and alcohol infused trip through a typical touring day of his. The camera movements and cinematography stood out, adding another fun scene to the overall experience.The story to me felt like an insane juggling act. The odd fourth-wall breaking moments didn't really go anywhere, I found those out of place at times. The narrative skipped and skimmed a time too often, cutting out key moments and choosing to focus heavily on sex and drugs. I realise that is what made the band infamous and some extremely mature content is necessary to accurately convey a situation, but when it's obvious that a grotesque scene is only there for shock value and not to imply something a little more meaningful, it's just plain distasteful. The film thankfully chooses to go a tad more personal in its last half hour, wisely shaking off all that unnecessarily crude content. That's not to say that there aren't any funny moments, the jokes land pretty well despite all the distasteful material.""The Dirt"", if it would have focused just a little more on a cohesive story and less shock-value gross-out moments, could have been genuinely great. It was a bumpy ride, yet the performances stuck with me and the experience was definitely there. The unforgiving, sad, zany ride that was this movie is worth a watch though.",The Dirt
46,labng,Possibly the worst Rock biopic ever,1,25 March 2019,"This would have been better presented in animation. Just truly awful. I read the book. It would be difficult to effectively address in a movie and remain palatable, but ham handed would be a false compliment here.",The Dirt
47,torrascotia,Everything Bohemian Rhapsody Aint.,8,30 May 2019,"There seems to be a number of rock biography movies around at the moment, the most hyped of course was the Queen Bohemian Rhapsody movie. At the other end of the scale was the death metal movie Lords of Chaos. Neither of which are anywhere near as good as The Dirt.
Bohemian was basically a polished shiny fluff piece in which the world of rock and rock doesn't have sex or drugs. Not to mention rock n roll. That is what happens when those involved want to protect ""the legacy"", it looks like an afternoon TV movie.
Lords was basically a nihilistic look at a bunch of losers who ruined their own lives and the lives of others for dumb ideas, it wasn't a fun watch and will likely sink without trace.
The Dirt is warts and all and that is where the fun is obviously. The whole point of being in a rock and roll band is access to the sex and drugs and to have a great time.
This movie reflects that attitude and why not as thats the truth?
The story is far more realistic as there is a balance between the highs and the lows, it reflects the sometimes strained relationships between the band members and lets you see when each member is at fault. Its a far more honest movie than Bohemian.
Strangely enough the people who are more likely to enjoy the thrill ride of the story are people like me, who don't even know about Motley Crue or even like the music. I haven't read the book but if you know whats coming there will not be any shocks or surprises.
There is more enjoyment in ten mins of this movie than there is in the three or four hours of Bohemian Rhapsody and Lords of Chaos combined.
Sex, drugs and rock n roll, as its supposed to be.",The Dirt
48,iamtherobotman,I'm notley a crue member...,9,25 March 2019,"I was never a fan of Motley Crue. Rightly or wrongly I always took them as one of those 'hair bands' or as I refer to them 'Poodle Bands', their image just never appealed to me.
When I saw this film was coming to Netflix I was nonplussed but when it came up as one of my 'recommended' I thought i'd take a punt at it and how please I am that I done so. The pacing is bang on, the structure of the film is brilliant and having each member of the band take up the narrative keeps it entertaining.Many events throughout the film i'd heard about over the years but being honest, never paid much attention to as I had no interest in the band or their music. Seeing them played out on screen however in such a captivating manner helps me to appreciate just how mad these guys were. For the record, i'm still not a fan of the band, but this is one brilliantly made film. I have no doubt fans of them will pick up on inaccuracies and no doubt notice some glaring omissions but name one film ever made which sticks exactly to the real life narrative!! This is an entertaining film, well paced( as mentioned previously) well acted, well scripted and well directed and produced.For me this is a must see film whether you're a fan or not, get this on your 'to watch' list now.

I was born in the 80s and although i remember motley crew to look at i hadnt ever followed or listened to their mysic when young but wish i had from the sountrack to this film its Great really gets your pymping while watching. The film itself is quite fast paced. Its heavy on drugs and sex from the opening scene. Its great to watch the individual band members meet each other and grow and develop together. The actings great and you feel for each character. I have no idea why critics in other places have give this film such bad reviee. My advice is ignore them as ling as yoyr not sensitive to such scenes as stated,The Dirt

51,svhot,"""The Dirt"" is an enjoyable mini-biopic, so enjoy it.",8,10 April 2019,"""The Dirt"" is based on the real story of Motley Crue - a rock and roll band. Yes, it is a bit cheesy and over-the-top, but that is the most lovable element about the 80s rock. The movie uses the four band member narratives style (just like in the book). The movie does not take itself too seriously, and that's good because every movie does not require the ""serious"" rule.Critics should not do a detailed comparison between the book and this movie, because there is no need to do so. Come on critics, the book was detailed and quite long - I know that fact already. This movie ""The Dirt"" is almost close to two hours in length. You cannot expect each and every detail and all the incidents regarding the Motley Crue being thrown in the movie within its limited running time.""The Dirt"" definitely lives up to its title because it shows the negative sides and mistakes of the four band members. The movie does manage to convince the viewers to sympathize with the rock and roll group in a few scenes. However, the makers of ""The Dirt"" know very well what they have made - an entertaining and darkly fun look movie about the Motley Crue. Therefore, watch it and just enjoy the roller coaster ride while it lasts.",The Dirt
52,mungflesh,"Dirty, amusing decadence",7,10 April 2019,"The Dirt is very entertaining.It's pretty wild, as it should be, with an undercurrent of Wayne's World in the first half and, as per the story of the band, gets gradually darker as the movie progresses and also a bit less interesting.There's an air of Spinal Tap about it, which is unavoidable, since the story of the Crue is not exactly real life - as most of us know it. It would be ironic to suggest the characters are not believable.Overall, I think the movie makes the band quite cool and likeable; they never took themselves too seriously, so neither should the movie.The finesse of Bohemian Rhapsody and Straight Outa Compton is missing from The Dirt but it's enjoyable nonetheless.",The Dirt

ANY movie about a superhero is supported - and that is why the quality suffers. This movie doesn't even try. It trots out one cliiche after another. The dialogue is so painfully bad and contrived.

It doesn't contain everything in the book of course, but it covers the necessities: the formation of the band, the background of the band members, the dark history of drug abuse, the hilarious over-the-top shenanigans the band was responsible for, and much more. It's not a disappointment to any fan of the book, and for anyone unfamiliar to it, it's a great depiction of how it all went down. Fans of the book shouldn't be displeased, as they do act out some of the scenes and facts from the book. Some events in the film actually happened, some didn't, some truths were stretched for effect, but that's a typical for book-to-film adaptations. All in all, it's accurate, and wild.The movie plays from a narrative point of view, and doesn't take itself seriously, while occasionally breaking the fourth wall. It's a wild ride, from start to finish, that shows how absolutely bonkers the whole band is, especially when they're together. It's fun, offensive, deep, cheesy, sad, powerful, overall a great portrayal of a classic, 80's, up-and-coming, American metal band.It's not for all, and it's not perfect, but it's a good story, and scary how accurate it is.",The Dirt

It's a biography, drama, and comedy about the history of rock'n'roll band Motley Crue, something everyone already knows beforehand. Rock band movies already presuppose the old stereotype of content revolving around sex, drugs and rock'n roll. And around that is that basically and intensely lived the members of this band, accompanied by the consequences of this lifestyle: fame, money, confusion; vanities, fights; follies; irresponsibility, promiscuity; lust; avarice; etc. The title ""dirty"" sums it up. Regardless of whether you're a Motley Crue fan, it's worth watching the movie. It's a portrait of the lifestyle of an 80s rock star. It's good entertainment. I recommend.",The Dirt
61,cyifly-2,"Good Show, Raunchy Fun, But Too Condensed",8,23 March 2019,"The long anticipated movie 'The Dirt' was finally released. Being a huge fan, I had to watch it the second it was available and was not disappointed. Good acting, decent story telling, and great music. A hard R rating is deserved -- Lots of sex, drugs, and Rock N Roll - The way a Crue story should be. I only had 3 real complaints about the movie:1. It was a bit too condensed. Lots of parts were rushed, some left out and some didn't even follow the book in order to fit the movie into a neat, short package. I would rather have had a mini-series, told the stories in their entirety and not rushed the story.2. They left out some of the great things about the 80's. The movie starts off talking about it, but then leaves the 80's out. The big hair, the clothes, the set. It all seemed like they were trying to be nostalgic but not too dated. It was the Strip in the 80's... Get nostalgic. Girls had big hair. Mick had hair down to his elbows. All the Crue guys had HUGE hair. Those short, ugly mullets were not how they looked in the 80's . Everything just seemed very tamed down.3. Where was the music in this? It played here and there, but how did they come up with ideas for the songs. How did they write them? This came across like Nikki wrote everything and just handed out notes on what to sing and play. That's not exactly how it happened. Some of these songs took lots of time, emotion and effort. We saw none of that. One song after another was just ready to go. There was an opportunity to put some heart into it, and it was missed.But -- I can get past that and I really enjoyed it. I understand that they wanted to make a simple movie and not as many people would sit through a 3-hour Motley Crue film. It was good raunchy fun and hard not to like. I will definitely watch it again.",The Dirt

63,umimelectric,Cool Movie- even if you're not a big fan,7,28 May 2019,"I was born in the eighties, so I was a kid pooping my pants while these guys were famously trashing hotel rooms, ingesting drugs off of the bodies of groupies, overdosing at parties, and well, probably also pooping their pants. As a teen in the late 90's I was exposed to cassette tapes of their 80's work like Girls Girls Girls & Theatre of Pain and I became somewhat of a fan. Ever since, I've been pretty mild in my feelings towards the band but always liked a good bit of their music, and watched all the documentaries of their exploits. As a casual fan who is familiar with their history, I can say this was a very fun movie to watch. A job well done, and probably entertaining for most viewers who aren't easily fatigued by sex, drugs, and rock 'n roll.",The Dirt
64,pcampionz,Entertaining,9,23 May 2020,I remember seeing these guys in Detroit when they were first getting AirPlay back in the early 80s they really hadn't had any hits out yet but they were starting to be the rave back in about 1984-1985. I was not impressed. But over the years Motley grew on me and I have seen the several times after that. Always a great show! The Dirt was entertaining and it was great to see how the band met and How they all became friends. Worth the watch!!!!,The Dirt

The ONLY thing one can say about this flick is that it's ONLY cute for big hair band lovers -- specifically Mothley Crue fans. Beyond that, it's exactly what you'd expect but much worse.

I've seen everything new come along since the Doors played the Whiskey. Yes, there were some great metal bands come through town. GnR's is one! They were just phenomenal! Early LA Metallica were the shjt!!! But Motley? Poison? Ratt? Stupid chicks and moronic boys were their audience. It's real simple, there is substance and there is shjt. But wait!!!!

I also admit my mates loved them and I was dragged into the big hair orbit on more than one occasion.
This is a well told story about regrets,love, hedonism and music. About lost souls searching. about lost souls finding.

Every actor does an excellent job at acting the outrageously excessive scenes with the quiet emotional ones, the stand out for me has to be Daniel Webber who plays Vince Neil, the lead singer of Motley Crue. His performance is versatile to the extreme having to portray some of the most emotional as well as the extravagant.The director Jeff Tremaine does a brilliant job of showing us the excessiveness in interesting ways, one section in particular where the drummer Tommy Lee tells the audience about how his days usually play out and Tremaine shows the audience by using mostly a first person camera perspective mixed with medium close-ups which creates a jarring feel making the audience feel dizzy, like Tommy Lee in the scene in question.Its one major down fall is the writing, as I said I got my cliched music biopic with slow motion band shots and other music biopic conventions. I did not know anything about the bands story going into the film and I still knew how the story would go. The fourth wall breaking adds to the experience but it can't shake its clichés.7/10",The Dirt

It start with parties, drugs rock'n roll and all. We see how the band was made, then how it can died at any time. We saw the sad thing, the car accident of Vince Neil, the drugs overdose of Nikki Syxx. Mick Mars numerous body problems. The lover of the band Tommy Lee wedding while he slept with other girls before and after... but it's really the actors who shine. Many will compare with Queen - Bohemian Rhapsody. I loved it, but this film feels even more bigger. We even have cameos (made by actors) from Ozzy Osbourne (Gross scene) and Van Halen's David Lee Roth.I recommend this film without spoiling you the story if you have not seen the book, but it's truly a performance film, even Machine Gun Kelly made me forger he is MGK with a great portray of Tommy Lee.",The Dirt

I will say my most pleasant surprise about this movie was the acting.

I really felt that this movie was, from what I've read, and from VH1 behind the music, fairly accurate portrayal of Mötley Crüe. They're drugged up, over sexed, rocknroll in their veins 24/7 (They actually do a really cool moment in the movie when they break the fourth wall and say ""do you want to know what it's like to be us on tour?"")

They go way overboard trying to prove how shocking these guys are. Running through the hotels, acting like maniacs, etc. Yeah, ok - we get it - Motley Crue were a wild bunch back in the day. But like all good stories - the stories get exaggerated as time goes on. If you can get past the fake wigs and all the overboard, wild action - you may get some enjoyment out of this flick. But if it's all too embarrassing with the crappy acting, bad wigs, etc., just do what I did - and put on a good album like Tool's ""10,000 Days"".I got second hand embarrassment from watching these bad actors & directors trying to use ""shock & awe"" to dazzle everybody.

I also never read the book. Given all of that, it was a pretty fun movie overall, even if it was too comical at times. Lots of fun nostalgia points and the craziness you imagined happened to them over the years. The movie doesn't take itself seriously at all, which is both good and bad. They've got a couple top quality actors that get hidden behind the whole 80s and 90s hair band costume joke. And then they throw in some of the tragedy details that don't really evoke a lot beyond just telling you that it happened - I cried just from reading a quick article about Vince's daughter passing but the movie simply treated it as a five minute break from a bender. Overall, it's a good glossover of the band and some personal things that happened to them, but as mentioned elsewhere they didn't have time to include everything.",The Dirt
120,bdan35,Everything you would want and expect,9,25 March 2019,"The Dirt wasn't made for everybody, but if you embrace the ""sex, drugs and rock n roll"" on steroids angle, it's as fun as anything I've seen in recent years. Of note is how the Netflix platform likely allowed for more creative liberties and boundary-pushing, which is exactly what the film needed to do it right. Disregarding the factual inaccuracies and twisted timeline, the heavier moments land at times while MGK and Weber's performances are fun and visceral, respectively. There are a lot of detractors that can be found in The Dirt, but it's ultimately a sensationalized and adrenalized perspective of 80's american popculture.",The Dirt
121,jenaycarter,Best Heavy Metal Movie Ever!!~ Jenay Carter,10,22 April 2019,"I absolutely love this band!! I love the story line behind it! And ever since I've watched it, i just can't stop listening to Mötley Crüe. Say what you want, but this movie is bad ass!I mean it I could literally watch this movie every day and it wouldn't bother me one bit. For starters the cast was amazing! Every actor that I examined, portrayed their characters in their own way, and it's what made the characters come to life. It's what made Nikki Sixx, Tommy Lee, Vince Neil, and Mick Mars relive their youth again. Down to the costumes, the hair, and the music! It was all just so wonderful!I only wish that the movie was two hours. I say that because, I feel they could have had a chance to include songs such as ""Smokin in the Boys room"", and my all time favorite ""Too Young To Fall In Love"". I would have really loved to hear those songs. And I would have loved to see all characters dressed for each music video. I would have also liked to have seen the movie explore each member's past and what it was like for them to go into rehab in and out.Bottom line, I love this movie, and if it doesn't get an award I will cry tremendously!!",The Dirt
122,boogbarton,Entertaining movie! Crazy story!,9,23 March 2019,"Motley Crue is a great rock band. Partial to them since growing up in the 80s listening to them. Their story is good and very entraining but the movie lacked that big movie presents. Realizing we just got Bohemia Rhapsody and it's block buster, award winning status. Hard to put a rock band movie out after such a great Queens movie. Another reviewer wrote about it being like a lifetime movie, this totally describes it. Love the band, incredible story, worth a watch for any die hard rock fan. Just make sure the kids aren't around...",The Dirt
123,dtnmusic,Bad execution,5,24 January 2020,"Acting and production is awful. I LOVE the Crue. This should have been done properly. Go watch The Doors to fully understand what a big budget, director, and actors can do for a band movie.",The Dirt
124,hallmitchell,Rushed and Unfocused.,4,22 March 2019,"I've been looking forward to this movie for such a long time and I finally got to see it. The movie is rushed. Tommy Lee is terribly underwritten and miscast. Where he' s just this guy who hangs around and says ""Dude"" a lot.Nikki Sixx the mastermind of the band is just shooting up all the time or doing blow and has minimal lines or impact on the movie.Vince Neil - good casting and this Aussie actor gives it a red hot go.Mick Mars - Again very underwritten.The worst type of biopic is one that just rushes through life events. Which is what The Dirt does. I wanted something more than the McDonald's of biopics especially for this band.If David Fincher was in the mix at some point they should of thrown everything at him or done everything they could of done to get his services.It's a bad script and does not bring out the chemistry or the figures that made Motley Crue.",The Dirt
125,bournejackal,Head banging fun,8,23 March 2019,"I have been a fan of Motley Crue since the 80's and I've aeem them twice in concert. I've always wanted to know how they lived there rock and roll life. Well there book The Dirt didn't hold anything back. Now this movie didn't hold anything back either.
I really loved how they became a band and how there first concert went. That I as crazy.
Throughout the movie, you will see how a hard rock life they lived. So much drugs and so many women. Each guy would probably have sex with each other's girlfriend at that time.
The music is so iconic and great. I wish they would have told us how those songs came to be.
This film holds nothing back.
This is a fun, entertaining ride. The 80's were the best.",The Dirt

These guys were serious bad boys and im sure if you asked them ""The Dirt"" is the ""Disney"" version of what really happened. Amazing Nikki Sixx(aka Frankie Feranna) or any of them for that matter are still around. So weird the critics hated it because I couldn't even get myself to get up and go to bathroom.",The Dirt
129,timhartland,Ordinary,3,22 March 2019,This is so ordinary compared to a movie like Bohemian Rhapsody. There were about 20 foul words in first 5-10 minutes and went downhill from there. Just a yuk feel movie.,The Dirt
130,orgrabbit,Meh.,6,24 March 2019,If 'Bohemian Rhapsody' had an illegitimate child it would be 'The Dirt'. It's an enjoyable movie although lacking any sense of drama in the dramatic sequences. It was the equivalent of one of those bad TV movies about behind the scenes of a popular sitcom. Fans may recall the events and escapades of the band during their heyday and hopefully the music will gain the band a new following.,The Dirt
131,rjw999,Accurate portrayal of 80s LA rock scene,7,24 March 2019,"I lived this era and this all looked so familiar. Right down to the KLOS tee-shirt. I wasn't a big fan of hard rocking hair bands. I was into alt-Rock playing on KROQ. Still I frequented the very bars and music venues featured in this film - Whiskey a go-go, troubadour, rainbow room. Just watching this film took me back to those days. Very cool. I feel like driving up to LA now. The crazy things this band did was always in the news. The music is iconic. Makes me appreciate it more now than I did while living through it. I miss that LA. It was crazy fun.",The Dirt
132,buccola13,Hits a wall,6,31 March 2019,"The Dirt started out great. It was raw from frame one. The 4th wall gets broken quickly and there's not really a reason for it. 2/3 of the way through the movie, the band hits their peak, and in the next scene hits bottom. It's confusing why the movie had it happen so quickly. It seems as if everyone involved kind of gave up. Make up and hair effects drop dramatically in quality, and suddenly the movie is over. It's an enjoyable watch because of the music and telling of some wild Motley Crue stories. It's a good watch, but not a great movie all the way through.",The Dirt
133,carlvan1977,I wasn't a fan of the band before the movie,7,23 March 2019,"I never liked Motley Crew and after seeing the movie I'm still not a fan.The movie though was not bad.Simple,predictable and it seemed to me that it was trying to be something like the The wolf of Wall Street but it came of as Over-exaggerated.I definitely recommend watching it.As long as you don't take it to seriously it's good fun.",The Dirt
134,moonz1972,Dirty and all the better for it.,10,22 March 2019,"Don't believe what they said about the hair metal scene in the 80's? Well here it is in all it's glory from the band who went there, did that and set the T-shirt on fire. Sex, drugs and Rock n Roll set against a very human story with a soundtrack that contains the some of the best Crue tracks recorded. Also a great cast.",The Dirt
135,kennywheeler-84081,It's pretty bad,4,27 March 2019,"It goes one of two ways for the actors in this movie: either they overact so hard it's painful, or they just don't bother acting at all. MGK is terrible, but you can tell he can play the drums. And the way it's presented is somehow different from other ""bad boy rock n roll guys"" biopics I've seen before. It just feels like a collection of stuff that happened to some guys in the 80's. I got the feeling you could mix up most of the scenes and put them wherever you wanted and it would work out about the same. Would have given it about two stars, but the early rehearsal and show scenes seemed pretty real. A lot of times in these kinds of movies the guys all meet each other and play together and it sounds perfect right away. They tried to make it sound and feel like a real band just getting their music together. Overall, I'd rather watch the VH1 behind the music.",The Dirt

139,cindyrellaexists,Not even close to the 'charisma' these guys have,2,23 March 2019,"Just no. It wasn't as dark and seductive the guys have always seemed to be. It was too silly and the narrator/actor came off as if he was pushed into sounding like a game show host from the 70's. I missed the heart pounding rage music. I think their story as a band deserved bigger, better, and louder. It just fell flat. I'm sorry but can we get a do-over?",The Dirt
140,tabachoi,From a non-fan,7,24 March 2019,"If you're into backstage debauchery, it's a fun waste of 2 hours. If you're curious about what made them great musically, you won't get anything from this movie. Entertaining, but felt empty afterwards.",The Dirt
141,sjsufan-4,too tame to actually say anything of worth,3,14 April 2019,"I may not know much about the band outside of their notoriety as deviants and what few songs were in Guitar Hero or Rock Band, but i have always been interested in cultures surrounding subgenres of music as well as the 80's as a whole so this film had everything going for it as far as i was concerned. getting the director of the Jack@$$ films to make a biopic about one of the gnarliest party bands in rock n roll? sign me up. little did i know, my optimisim would be tarnished by the time i finished this film.The Dirt is supposedly a tell-all tale of debauchery, hijinks, and the inevitable fallout from it all but it omits the truly debaucherous parts of their lives, has enough scenes of hijinks to count on one hand, and inevitable fallout that has no depth or purpose to it. this is as sterile as a film about highly unsterile people can get.the main issue with this film is that its so clearly trying to be the Wolf of Wall Street for the music world without having the guts to follow through with it. the film flirts with stylized storytelling but only ever breaks it out for two or three sequences. it wants to portray the guys as being @$$holes but keeps justifying their actions (google what actually happened in the bus scene and you'll be pretty shocked at just how they manipulated the truth) and what dark moments are shown (drug addiction) are relegated to a mere montage instead of actually exploring what brought them to that place on anything other than a surface level.the film also seems to be at a loss with what to do with these characters. Nikki Sixx is toted as the main character but has no discernible characteristics to speak of other than mommy issues and drug addiction and as mentioned above, none of these things are explored deeply enough for us to sink our teeth into. MGK as Tommy Lee absolutely shines but the parts of his life worth exploring (his penchant for abusing women) and dissecting are relegated to a two minute scene of his wife leaving him. Its clear that he was the only one able to make something interesting of a doubtlessly poorly written character. the actor portraying Vince Neil only shows a semblance of greatness when he needs to access extreme emotions but even still gets acted under the table by a four year old playing his daughter. The rest of the time his line deliveries are so awkward and stilted he almost seems like a non-actor. But the biggest dissapointment here is how criminally underutilized Ramsay Bolton (idk how to spell his actual name) is as Mick Mars. Other than MGK, he's the most famous actor in the cast and yet he's just a background character at best. the truly unfortunate thing is that the writing is clearly too awful for him to take the PSH approach to character acting and make something incredible of a small role. the film totes Mars as an ""alien"" but he doesnt act strange enough to really sell that.but i think worst of all is the direction. Jeff Tremaine is known as the mastermind behind Jack@$$ and this is his first TRUE film. it seems as if instead of tapping into what makes him unique as an artist, he made a cookie cutter biopic. there are only two sequences in the film where his style is felt and they are both too brief. they seem to imply a frantic energy that the rest of the film just doesnt have.i'm not saying the film should have been just about the chaos of being a partying rockstar, but i think it could have benefited from a more chaotic feel. instead what we get is an extremely tame by-the-numbers biopic that doesnt really want to get down and dirty, it just wants to use that as a marketing scheme.in the right hands this could have been a visceral whirlwind of a film about the pros and pitfalls of being a rockstar while also using the past to explore the kinds of behavior that led to the MeToo movement, but instead we get another by-the-books biopic thats too concerned with protecting its subject's egos to say anything of note.skip it unless you're a film student. if you're a film student, i highly recommend using this film in an essay. there are so many issues to unpack that i guarantee you'll get a good grade, given you have a healthy idea of film criticism.",The Dirt
142,zigurusejin,"Like ""Spinal Tap"" but without any funny jokes",3,11 November 2019,"I'm surprised that anyone would want to make this type of film after ""This is Spinal Tap"". This one occasionally tries to be funny but in a crass and vulgar, not subtle or intelligent way. It has its moments but the music is so atrociously bad that I had to stop half-way through. Strictly for the exceptionally unsophisticated.",The Dirt

144,Jaggermaster,A disappointment yet entertaining,5,12 March 2020,"I love Mötley Crüe, I love The Dirt (book), how many times I've read it I dunno. It's simply THE best biography ever, it's funny, sad, sick and disgusting. When I first heard they're making a movie, I got hyped. Then I saw the running time, the whole book just in two hours, no f-n way! And that's what disappointed me. Maybe if u haven't read the book, then u probably enjoy this movie but cuz I remember every single detail from book, I got little nervous when they left so many important thing out. For example, John Corabi was there for about 2 mins maybe(?), Vince's departure, Mick's illness and financial problems, Tommy and his prison time. Yeah these are all band members personal problems but they are what made them THE Mötley Crüe. Instead of this they should've had release two two hour movies.Actors, setting and script were/is good. Like I said, I was disappointed but it's still fun and entertaining movie and would love to watch it again.",The Dirt
145,roodlemania,Good for what it was,8,23 March 2019,"This movie is derived from the book, The Dirt, so there is going to be an element of clownishness about it, since it's derived from the stories each of the band members told. So there's no comparison to say, Bohemian Rhapsody which was a serious biopic. I was fully satisfied by it, as a reader of the book they pretty much covered all the territory. Fun, and enjoyable if you're not expecting a brooding serious movie about Motley Crue.",The Dirt
146,chloe-webb-01,Insert comedy and tragedy masks,7,24 March 2019,"If you've read the book, it's basically every detail that stands out in that. The highs and the lows, the partying, the girls, the adrenaline to the heart, the car crash, Vince losing his daughter, Tommy's marriage, Mick's illness. I feel that the film had a very new age feel, rather than a proper nostalgic time setting. The costumes for some of them seem fresh off the rack, and not really true to what was worn in the time period. Yes the band members attention to detail was great, but not so much on the extras. The setting for the Rainbow was spot on! I felt as though as I was in the real place. Maybe it was? It did feel very rushed, I realise there was a lot to tell, but it didn't hang on long enough to important things to make you truly FEEL emotions. It needed some camera filters and more darkness in some parts. It was fun for the viewer and plays some classics from the band's catalogue. The settings were great, and the actors did a good job imitating the members. But it was very crisp. It needed a bit more rawness, and music to evoke emotion. Overall, good film and I don't regret watching it as it refreshed my memory on the book.",The Dirt
147,sara-caroline,Who?,1,26 March 2019,"I'm sorry to put it out there, but I know music. The movie is probably a good story about a rock band, but they most certainly are not one of the worlds biggest in the genre.",The Dirt

Do I wish they included 'Wildside"" on the soundtrack? Yes. Will I buy this on blue ray when released?? Absolutely!!! - if you've read the book it will of course make the movie better (as they left many parts of the book out for better or worse) but I watched with some friends who didn't read the book (n aren't Crüe fans to the extent that I am) and they loved it. People will likely nip pick it to shreds but it was so fun and dark and sad and heavy - a little music lite for me in that I wish they featured so many more of their songs but the movie was really great and I'm glad they did this movie with reverence as it could have so easily been campy and cheesy and it's wasn't at all to me - I LOVED IT!!",The Dirt

We have watched it 3 times and I want to watch it over and over and over! It is very interesting to see how Motley Crue began, their backgrounds, and their rise to fame. The movie is fast paced and never gets bogged down in details. I love the sex, drugs and rock and roll and it's really so refreshing in this day of political correctness gone awry!

I love it!It was all started out with finding a right singer and built it all the way to Hollywood's famous style of late 70's to mid-80's.Of course, it had a dark side with drugs, sex, affairs, wildly violent, and losing friends in between, but as for the rest, it was all their point of views on choices and path they've created.It was worth to watch, and this show should've been 10/10.",The Dirt

176,jhowington32,Enjoyable,8,17 April 2019,"I feel like there could've been A LOT more told about the band. I'm not a big fan of MGK, but he surprisingly did a good job as Tommy Lee. The music is great, the pacing is pretty good. The worst part of this film hands down is Pete Davidson. This dude has no screen presence, and just looks awkward and out of place throughout this entire film. He was horribly miscast.

But you're never going to fit everything in to a film that's nearly two hours.
What you get is a basic story through Nikki's eyes. It fun, you get lots of the early music And all the later hits and the actors do a really great job. Definitely worth a watch if your a Crue fan or not. Completely different to the Queen film but in a good way. I enjoyed both. Go see it!!",The Dirt
179,jefe1973,Good way to kill some time!,8,22 March 2019,Good movie and a good story. I thought it was going to be a little corny after a few minutes in but it picks up pretty quick. Nikki and Tommy's characters are well played. The other two aren't bad either but not as strong. I'm a fan of the band (especially their first two albums) but it touches on a little of everything. They jump through a couple albums pretty quic but there's only so much time to tell a 30 year story.,The Dirt

The humor keeps it from getting too dark and I actually enjoyed the music, even though I've never owned any Crue music. I was born the same month and year as Tommy Lee, so I remember those years before AIDS and political correctness brought the party to screeching halt. Just sit back and enjoy the ride!",The Dirt

I'm a big hair metal fan and was looking forward to this movie, but the hair and makeup didn't look realistic, especially the wigs. The movie tells a great story and has great music, and these factors keep the movie entertaining which saves it from being a bad movie.

This movie was pure garbage and made the band look like idiots more than rock stars. I can't believe the band was involved in making this mess. The movie seemed to be directed by a high school kid it was so bad. I get sex, drugs, and rock n roll but according to this movie Motley Crue members as people were completely void of any true human traits.

The main point being, this is a small glimpse into the overly insane adventures of the band. It is by no means a complete substitute for reading the book. However, having read the book 1st I found the film an enjoyable montage of reenactments and better than I expected it to be.",The Dirt
195,Slavic,"The Legends of Sex, Drugs and Rock N' Roll",10,22 March 2019,"This movie tells the story of the glam rock band Motley Crue. From its humble beginnings of small venues and clubs to the world tours of sold-out arenas. The story is told primarily by its bass player member Nikki Sixx and ocasionnaly by Tommy Lee, Mick Mars and Vince Neil breaking the 4th wall.This is by far the most entertaining biopic film of any rock band in recent memory striking a good balance between comedy and drama. It's a wild ride and it's not afraid to show it. It shows a lot of partying, debauchery, drugs and sex, but also ups and downs of each band member fighting his own demons. Noone comes off here unscathed by some battle or own personal tragedy. The band's music is represented well here, showcasing their many hit songs like ""Live Wire"", ""Shout At The Devil"", ""Kickstart My Heat"", ""Same Ol' Situation"" and ""Home Sweet Home"". I enjoyed particularly one scene where the band was auditioning Vince Niel and in process discovered their unique sound.This movie is what Rock Of Ages is not. It takes no holds barred, unappologetic and candid approach to tell the story of perhaps one of the greatest glam rock band in the American rock history.",The Dirt
196,icuruok,Underwhelmed,1,24 March 2019,"Why didn't they just call it ""The Nikki Sixx Story""? Hardly any of Mick's back story is included. The actor portraying Vince is phenomenally atrocious. The only part worth mentioning is the closing credits.",The Dirt

You really get to see the perspectives from the members, and the story is pretty much perfect all though Nikki Sixx in the movie doesent have the right bass and isnt holding the bass as the real Sixx holds it.

198,xtopheles-1,I heen listening to more crue since this movie,9,13 April 2019,If you were a motley crue fan you wil love it i gave 9 star beuse they dint focus on mike Mars who i find to be the more interesting band member of the crue is mostly tommy and niki sixx also vince Neil i felt mick mars was lef out since he was the moral compass of the crue i think he had the most interesting story he had a lot of obstacles in the time of the crue. He was not a crazy party monter just like th rest. Also he is a excellent guitar pleter who had the mos awesome rips in the crue life span while rest of the band menbers were .acting . Mars was obseibg from the corner over all i think mars is a hell of lead guitarist he is on the top 50 of best guitars players. Just keep in mind when you hear crue that awesome riff is mars sixx dint know how to play he was just a pretty faceand mostly a song writer,The Dirt
199,jessiejpb,More about their hedonistic lifestyles than the music,5,19 July 2019,"I get that Motley Crue was known for their antics and wild lifestyle offstage, so the movie definitely stays true to that and doesn't shy away from showing how insane they were, but this is really not my kind of biopic. I'm not even going to compare it to Bohemian Rhapsody, which I absolutely love, because they are biopics that exist in different stratospheres and focus on completely different aspects of their musicians lives. However, I found that The Dirt's hedonistic elements drowned out the rest of the movie and made some of the more emotional, ""human"" moments such as the death of Vince's daughter and the addiction and near death experience of Nikki Sixx less impacting. It's hard to take adult men seriously when they run around creating havoc like uncaged animals all the time and take no accountability for their actions.. until tragedy strikes. Also, I am by no means a prude or even a feminist, but the scene near the beginning where the girl is sq*****g at the party was unnecessary and flat out gratuitous. Honestly, it was shocking and gross to see. It put a bad taste in my mouth for the rest of the movie. I get it...this band was all about shock value...but where's the music in all of this?? Dirt is an appropriate name for the movie because you finish it feeling like a sinner by association and desperately needing to wash all the grime away. It's good that Netflix picked it up because it is nowhere near movie theatre level quality and probably would've tanked at the box office, even just based on the R-rating alone. It's not a biopic that is going to change your life, and actually makes me wonder why Motley Crue are being celebrated for their bad behaviour... It just feels like an excuse to objectify women, and throw tons of drugs and F words around.I gave it a 5 because there were moments I enjoyed, but it's a shame that they were too few and far between for me.",The Dirt
200,libee84,No,3,10 June 2019,"Not good enough. The people they cast were not great choices in my opinion, especially for Nikki and Tommy. Vince wasn't too bad in certain scenes.

201,davvanolsson,Cliché version of the book,1,31 March 2019,"This book was not converted good at all. It felt like a bad BBC comedy show.
The actors felt like they had no depth in their acting. Casting was terrible. Characters were shallow. It did not feel believable. Too MTV-ish in the cutting/directing when they should have gone more of a darker/noir route.",The Dirt
202,slobinchair,Its like Disney does Dirt and makes Theatre Of Pain,5,27 March 2019,"After finally making it through The Netflix made Motley Crue film THE DIRT I have decided to reassess my initial glib, off-the-cuff attack on the film and talk about it as a whole. Previously unable to watch more than 10 minutes of THE DIRT before having to shut down the visual assault to my intelligence, I persisted in order to pass comment on a show that I was so much looking forward to watching.Admittedly I have a different take on this film to most, the first Crue album TOO FAST FOR LOVE changed my life, as a young British lad still fairly new to guitar playing and songwriting, TFFL pushed open a new musical door, where my first love which was Punk Rock was tied to more complex Heavy Rock styles but still had melody and BIG CHORUSES which I gained from loving Bowie, Slade, Sweet and TREX.THE DIRT is entertaining when on a base, ""isn't this a funny story about boys going wild and yet surviving the craziness"" level, which is what it was surely designed to be.Mistakes in wrongly used instruments and technical stuff aside, I simply found it bland! The film didn't seem to capture what must have been unbelievable highs and ecstatic moments of madness nor did it convey the deep sadness of the two notable deaths in the Motley Crue story, it even stumbled with ridiculousness through the near-death episode that Sixx stupidly suffered. Can anyone imagine an ambulance crew member really saying, ""this is Nikki Sixx I cannot let him die""?I consider THE DIRT BOOK to be a veritable mine of opportunity for someone to capture and convey the excess of 80's Metal, how the Punk element filtered into the mix and utter chaos ensued, here was a way of enhancing the music of the time with passion and excitement to match BUT it failed to do so. It limped its way through stereotypical one-liners, fawning leggy blondes and flash bombs with no depth, no real feeling or expression, portraying the scene as nothing more than a world of plastic, hedonistic morons often portrayed as they were on stage but not necessarily representative of folk who could play and write good music.Whether readers of this like or hate Motley Crue the reality is that their first album TOO FAST FOR LOVE was a game changer, it opened the door for so many bands to fuse outside elements into metal and it happened at the start of a new decade, one that saw so much greed and excess. THE DIRT is not a game-changer, it doesn't even try to be and for that single reason alone I can only rate it 5/10",The Dirt
203,cantbesuperman2010,Pros and cons,7,22 March 2019,"Pros: it's a Motley Crüe movie. And let's be real we are all Crüeheads in our own right. I think the movie was pretty well done, Jeff Tremain did an excellent job. Mick was hilarious, while still being very Mars.Cons: if you read the book, half the content is gone, no Japan arests, no Tommy drama with Pam, no real Vince drama. The end of the movie felt very rushed. Especially the meeting, there was NO DRAMA with getting Vince back in the band. And basically skipped over the entire time Corabi was in the band.
Overall, I really liked the movie, I'd recommend it to anyone.",The Dirt

I could point out several ""mistakes"" but what would be the point, right? The guy who plays Vince Neil looks more like Dana Strum from Slaughter and the guy who plays Mick Mars is nowhere menacing enough. Can I call this movie good or bad? Nope. I'm no Gene Ebert. But, it's worth a look.",The Dirt
205,larisa-hadden,No. Just no.,5,25 March 2019,The acting is really terrible. It was as if Machine Gun Kelly and Pete Davidson went to classes on how not to act well. The opening scene was gross and not necessary. I think the director was still stuck in the Jackass mentality.,The Dirt

I might now after reading these reviews because it sounds like a great read. I do love their music and this movie could have been fantastic.My expectations weren't very high from the beginning as it was a straight to Netflix film and none of the actors are well known but I figured it would be a fun watch and I wasnt wrong about that. It's pretty entertaining and there were quite a few funny moments throughout.I thought Machine Gun Kelly did pretty well as Tommy but the rest of them kinda fell short. The movie felt super rushed and I was pretty lost in the timeline. Yes it is very cheesy but I'm fine with that for a movie about an 80s hair band.My biggest complaint above all for sure was the production value in general. They cut corners on a lot of things and I found myself cringing through the entire film. Everyone wore wigs and I mean come on, you couldn't have grown out and dyed your hair for a movie role? At the very least have great wigs if you're gonna do it that way. Towards the end they had the guy who played Vince Neil wearing the most ridiculous fake goatee and it drove me nuts. It reminded me of the jackass movie where they glued pubes to that dudes face. So bad lol. There were other things too but wed be here all day.Bottom line, the movie was nothing special but for a Friday night at home with nothing to do, It was alright.",The Dirt

This is a biopic based on events that actually happened so toning it down to fit in with our very recent socially acceptable standards would be doing it a great injustice. This movie is sex, drugs and rock n roll at its debauched best. The movie is both heartfelt and funny and gives a brief glimpse into the life of an 80s rock band.

213,StephenHarker,Over the Top in a Great Way!,9,5 August 2020,"I recently rewatched this movie after I watched it for the first time the day it came out and even though I liked it then, I have to admit I like it more upon rewatch than I did initially, now I even think it's underrated. At first viewing it seemed a bit disjointed in some places and too over the top but upon rewatch I think some scenes and sequence of events feeling disjointed is part of the idea and the over the top scenes and acting in some places is part of the movie's tone. The movie takes place in the 1980s and it plays out as over the top as most 80s movies so it makes sense for the tone. The movie is the story about the hair metal band Mötley Crüe and shows their highs and lows during the height of their popularity in the 1980s and early 1990s. The acting in the movie is really good and I think it's great that they got some unknown actors to play most memebers of the band. Colson Baker (Machine Gun Kelly) especially surprised me, I didn't know he was a good actor but this movie proved me wrong. The dialogue in the movie and the interactions between the characters felt very real and human which is welcomed in a movie filled with so many crazy moments. I also think the movie does a great job balancing comedy with drama. There are some funny moments but also some really dark scenes that deal with very heavy themes that I'm glad the movie didn't shy away from showing since those events did happen in real life. That's another point in the movie's favor, it doesn't play it safe with what it shows and what it doesn't, this movie is a hard 'R' rated movie and it's definitely not for kids but that's good because Mötley Crüe did lead 'R rated' lives. In the end, without giving too much away this movie can be enjoyed by fans of the band and newcomers alike. It has laughs, great music and some really hard-hitting emotional scenes. Give it a watch and see if it kickstarts your heart.",The Dirt

217,jordanf451,Disappointing,6,23 March 2019,"Entertaining and fun to watch, but shallow, cheesy and uninteresting for the most part. Just 4 young American rock stars getting high, getting laid and getting in trouble, with a little bit of drama in between.The problem is that in a couple of hours you can not tell the story of a group of people through the years. In that limited amount of time you can only focus on a specific situation or a specific character. If you try to cover so much you dont get past shallow waters. Compare this movie to Last Days, The Doors or even Bohemian Rhapsody and you will see how much potential was missing.Here stuffs just happen. Very linear story, like a chronicle full of ordinary situations, considering the context. Who can be impressed nowadays with rock stars doing drugs, drinking, having sex, cheating on their partners, getting married, fighting and crashing their cars while intoxicated? Give me a break...I respect the band and I like the band. So it was good to see a recreation of their early years. But the movie could have been much better, not just these chain of cliches, one after another. I'm sure there's a lot of material in the life of these guys that could have been exploited and presented in a very interesting way. I never read any biography about them before, and I was really surprised to see, for instance, that that crazy drummer was probably the most ingenuous and nicest and sane person in the band, with such a beautiful and kind parents... Isn't that interesting? Too bad the movie did not showed any of these nuances and contrasting elements in an interesting way.On a positive side the acting was good, as well as the production and maybe other technical elements.

Notably produced by the band themselves, perhaps this is simply their fantasized recollection of the good old days.Considering Tremaine's sensibilities and style, its not at all suprising this ""movie"" is a dumpster fire that likely only appeals to men of a certain age whom even in their 50s, never grew up nor gave up on the idea of being a rockstar.This worthless entry into the Netflix library does nothing to expand upon the already well documented history of the band.",The Dirt

They seem to have no problem making the women's hair look good(even though those fashions did not exist then). But the men all look like their wearing a pelt. Go back to cosmetology class.Too little time spent on the formative era of the band, and they were not that cocky or accomplished early on. They basically glossed over the entire ""Strip struggle"" that these guys, and other bands went through just to get a time slot at the Whiskey. you either knew someone or blew someone. That was the only way you got on that stage in the 80's.I could go on about all of the errors in this movie, but why bother?

You really better know what your doing or you're going to wind up with a colossal mess.That is exactly what happened here.I was a teenage metal fan in the 80s. I saw some of the shows and actually got to meet some of the members of the band. Vince Neil included. As such, I can tell you that whatever else they may be, the people depicted in 'The Dirt' are not Motley Crue. If anything, they are bad copies.Much like the movie itself.It would be easy to nitpick the whole piece to death but the core problem with 'The Dirt' is that it is a film written and made by people who do not know their subject matter . . . but think they do. Visually, the world of the 1980s is recreated in exacting detail and looks great. But neither the writer nor the director make any attempt to understand the music culture of the time or the musicians who formed the band beyond the cliff notes version.The result is a caricature movie. Well costumed actors pretending to be Motley Crue without really knowing who these people are and why their fans care about them and their music. The portrayals are over-the-top and often completely inaccurate, with Tommy Lee coming off like a jittery millennial fanboy and Vince Neil sounding like a cross between Jeff Spicoli and C.C. Deville.The reality is that Nikki Sixx, Tommy Lee, Vince Neil and Mick Mars were products of the 1970s culture who happened to appear on the Sunset Strip at a time when that culture was undergoing a dramatic shift. They, along with slate of other young musicians, launched a new style of music for the next decade.This is the point of the story and what ultimately makes Motley Crue unique. The partying and drug use are interesting but the music is what we, the fans cared about, what launched them to stardom and what kept us coming to the shows and buying the albums. And this is what we want to know about and is barely touched on in the movie.With a few notable exceptions, (Iwan Rheon's interpretation of Mick Mars, is a bit uneven but believable and Tony Cavalero's Ozzy Osbourne is dead on) this is one you want to miss if you were there.",The Dirt

229,maxtrep,Crühead since the movie,10,21 May 2019,"The only songs of Mötley Crüe I ever heard before this movie were Home sweet home, Kickstart my heart, Girls girls girls and Dr. Feelgood, because thats all the radios are allowed to play it seems. So I wanted to watch this movie I knew it was going to be good and boy is it good, it made me realize how cool the 80's were and specially these guys! Pure rock n roll, after watching the movie I've been listening to Too fast for love, Shout at the devil, Theatre of Pain, Girls girls girls and Dr. Feelgood back to back. Its all I listen to, these guys are geniuses and Mick Mars is a beast. Just watch this movie and nevermind those lame critics ou critics for the sale of criticizing. Thank me later !!!",The Dirt

It seemed very hard for them to overcome the hardships but all around great movie would definitely watch it again. Just the whole screenplay of it was amazing they really showed me what the 80's was really about.,The Dirt

Terrible writing is combined with even worse acting and direction to provide what can only be described as a joke of a film.

240,robbit-5,Trashy fun for when you have nothing better to do with your time,6,23 March 2019,"Deciding whether or not me and my wife both wanted to watched a Motley Crue related video was something of a Déjà vu moment. It transported us back to 1995 when that leaked sex tape of Tommy and Pam (who isn't mentioned once in this pseudo-documentary) was released. Should we watch this or not? Both times, we decided it should be at least good a laugh or two, given that their IQ's combined were that of an average sand flea. But we also experienced that same feeling that's akin to post meal indigestion where one questions why they ate at the Varsity (if you live in Atlanta), Checkers or McDonald's in the first place. You knew what you were going to get, so don't complain too loudly afterwards, right?It wasn't all bad and there was just enough nostalgia value to keep me from turning it off. One funny moment has Vince Neil briefly acknowledging what a piece of trash THEATRE OF PAIN was. Oh, I'm sorry. I shouldn't be giving all of the best parts away here, since there aren't all that many moments that will impress their hardcore fans (or detractors).Still, there were also few actual surprises for those who'd already the book or already knew the Motley Crue story. For me, it was more an exercise in seeing how awkwardly they navigated each key piece of their mythology. The simple fact that Jeff Tremaine (JACKASS) directed this tells you pretty much what you're going to get. All of the juicy, sordid bits get tossed together to make them look like Hair Metal superheroes. They got light on the accuracy and supporting details, just so no one with severe ADHD (their target audience) might get bored. I've seen worse, but I'd recommend spending your Friday night doing something else. Save this for when you truly are bored. 6 out of 10 (at best).",The Dirt

However, in this case, if one hadn't already read the book it would be hard to really piece it together. A lot of context is missing and too many times did the movie deviate from the biography and really made it horrible. This could have easily made a really great movie.

Am i forgetting The Crue history?How the hell are you going to jump from the 94 album straight to the Red White and Crue tour to show nothing from that tour, past Crue Fest straight to their final show in 2015?Are we just gonna flat out skip and ignore the fact that Nikki tried to copy Nine Inch Nails? Or even touch on Pam and Tommy (I mean that was pretty big), hell even Vinces racing? Golfing? Or stint on surreal life?Not gonna dig a bit deeper into how ""mysterious"" Mick Mars was/is?Give zero acknowledgement to any Corabi songs? Despite the fact he even had parts in the book?This movie is a trainwreck from the 10 minute mark until the end, despite being documented, the movie lacks cohesiveness. One story bleeds into the next.After waiting for the better part of a decade for this film to be picked up, filmed and released. I would much rather have seen it stay in preproduction for eternity.",The Dirt

The acting was beyond lousy, I think the SNL guy playing the label manager was probably the worst of the bunch. Lots of shock value scenes that were just so laughable.

Machine Gun Kelly knocked it out of the park as Tommy Lee. Being a huge Crue fan in the 80's none of the material in this film is new to me and yes I was very aware of inconsistencies that were presumably done for theatrical and story telling purposes. None of that bothers me. To me, this is the right kind of awesomely cheesy. I'm impressed with the actors in this film. They inhabited the personas of Vince, Mick, Nikki, and Tommy really well. And I think that was the idea. Lastly, I've always resonated most with Nikki and seeing his childhood trauma depicted on the big screen was deeply moving.

They got actors who look very close to the original people its scary. Lol. Only problem i have with the movie is with the actor who played the lead guitar player was to emotional down if he had been more up beat he would have been perfect.

I pretty much know all their main hits but couldn't rattle off the names of all the albums and songs like I probably could with Pink Floyd.I felt the movie did a great job of going into depth with each character so you can learn more about their story and see their development. Which is something I felt Bohemian Rhapsody did not do.From start to finish - it was a good mix of comedy, debauchery, crudeness and hilarity which is basically characterized Motley Crue in the 80s. Seeing characters break the 4th wall added another layer of humor.I am curious to find out how accurate the movie was with real life and what was exaggerated / kept out of the movie.My only complaint of the movie is that it was too short. Another 20 minutes would have been great. At the end, the movie left me wanting more so I guess maybe the duration was right.I'll go out on a limb and say I got more out of this movie character development wise than i did with Bohemian Rhapsody.",The Dirt

If you're seeking a mindless time kill you'll likely enjoy it. I would've preferred it if the movie had more depth and feeling to possibly draw the viewer to like the guys.Sadly, coming from ""Netflix"" it's probably one of their best movies.

It's hilarious, wild, funny, sad, gritty, dark and a really great throwback to the 80's and the wild ride that is, always has been and forever will be Mötley Crüe. Out of all their peers, they are the only band that has stood the test of time and can still sell out arenas. And, for a reason! The movie's based on their NY Times bestselling biography by the same name and considering how jam-packed that book is with sheer unbelievable debauchery and incredible tales, the movie covers A LOT of ground, and -best of all- stays really true to the book. This is definitely not a sterilized version of the book but it portrays a specific era and the way things were back then - good, bad, ugly and most importantly, real.
The casting is spot on as well. It's also a cautionary tale of what can happen to yourself, your families and friends when you take the lifestyle of sex, drugs and rock 'n' roll over the top the way these guys did.

300,mattparsonsiom,Read the book first....,6,24 March 2019,"Wasn't a Motley Crue fan and didn't really know much about them. Someone recommended the book and I gave it a go - it was absolutely phenomenal. It got me in to their music and their story as a whole. As an accompaniment to the book, this film is ok. It adds more colour to my already colourful mental image of them. If I hadn't read the book and bought in to the characters already however, it'd be a bit weak/thin. Quite entertaining and worth watching if you have time, but if you can, please read the book first.",The Dirt
301,fmathsson,"Very, very bad",1,7 April 2019,The movie itself is just terrible. Badly made and all the acting is below mediocre. It's very stereotypical and you can pretty much predict every line in the film because its been done before. I try my best to judge the film fairly. Hopefully my sheer hatred for mötley crüe isn't strong enough to taint my view of this motion picture.,The Dirt
302,kellyanneberg,I'm a huge Motley Crue fan and I loved it!,10,22 March 2019,I think the four actors that played them did a fantastic job getting down their mannerisms their walk and even the way they talk. I thought it was very well done and loved every minute of it !,The Dirt

306,gtillustrations,A breath of fresh air,8,23 March 2019,"Read a lot of critic reviews that say, more or less, ""it's 2019 and there's lots of strong women and this band is sexist and misogynistic.""This is a fun film. Many people seem to have forgotten what fun is. Fun is something that you can have when you're not weighed down by politics, gender craziness and being a miserable human being. Having sex can be fun. Being a man can be fun. Having sex when dressed up in tight jeans and killer long hair is...what for it...can be fun!The film takes a pretty decent and humorous look at the band, how they formed and features the groupies that apparently they took 'advantage of'. Because the groupies always, always had sex with high profile rockstars for completely selfless reasons...clearly.This 100% felt like a throwback to when films just cares about being interesting, enjoyable and light hearted. Sure there are some heavy moments, hitting women (or anyone for that matter) is never okay and the tone of the film does shift during a particular scene, but overall this was a huge break from the usual grimness of Hollywood and the serious musical biopics that feel like a chore to digest after awhile.It doesn't pander, not even slightly, to the SJW and probably the best line of the film is 'muzzle that'. A perfect quote that needs to be used more frequently in this day and age. Sometimes life is about getting drunk, having sex and being part of something more than just terrified all the time.This is a band that dressed up in tight leather, had hair like their mothers and still got laid every single night. The film does a great job of picking out the highs and sometimes cringe worthy lows of the band but it also speaks of a simpler time where being different was rewarded in its on way and the grind to the top was literally that, a grind. No YouTube sensations here!The music is captured brilliantly throughout and definitely stands the test of time, still enjoyable many years later. The carefree gig scene really shines even if every club is a dingy, sticky mess. Which is a perfect analogy for this film. It's messy, it's grungy, it's rock. There's blow jobs under the table and drugs on top. But it's all good because why shouldn't it be?The acting is fitting of almost a Bill and Ted adventure which is absolutely better than it sounds. The costume design is awful and the make up is over the top so the whole thing is captured perfectly. Each member is represented in their own way, Vinny the lead is constantly having sex with multiple women, Nikki Six is the lynch pin and even the supporting cast add their own weight to the film. ""Do not leave your girlfriend with Motley Crue...""
Ultimately I thoroughly enjoyed this film and it stands out especially in the current climate surrounding 'toxic masculintiy'. In fact I couldn't believe this made it to Netflix but was so glad it did. I still find it funny reading the negative reviews but honestly, this is one film where the audience score matters the most. Nothing wrong with rock stars, they were legends that no one in 2019 can come close to...probably because they couldn't get away with it.",The Dirt
307,nickshowmelater,What a ride,10,23 March 2019,"Been a fan since the happy 80's when I was 10 years old Mötley Crue has always been a part of my life. So now that I'm 45 and can see my idols behind the scene and everything private they went through made me sit here with tears rolling down the cheeks, but even with happines. I can understand if the movie isn't for everyone but for me it was epic. The characters live into their roles so they become one with Tommy, Vince, Mick and Nikki.

309,stuart-42348,Great escapism and nostalgic movie 🎥,8,22 March 2019,"Great movie that takes you back in time and if you lived through that time then its a nostalgic trip.
It's rude, loud and crude, but that's the Crue, so if you're offended then why the hell are you watching it.
Sure some timelines are a little all over the place and there are a number of key Crue moments that are left out or glossed over. However at 1hr and 48mins it's to be expected.
This is a movie that should have ran for a full 3 hours and really dragged you in, but instead it was nearly 2 hours of fast paced fun, debouchous, alcohol (and drug) fueled escapism, which is what the Crue are and were all about for many growing up.
Throw in there the tissue moments as well as the self reflection and you've a movie that could easily see a sequel.",The Dirt
310,brooksbeebe,Had I just not read the book...,6,22 March 2019,"I would've enjoyed the movie a lot more. On its own merit, the movie is extremely watchable. The casting choices were astonishing and the movie is very easy to watch pacing wise with no dragging at all. Unfortunately, that's my only issue with it because of how much had to be trimmed down and glossed over. Despite that, the finished product was well worth the wait.",The Dirt

If you want historic accuracy, read a book. The Dirt was an ENTERTAINING two hours and hell, I enjoyed it even though I'm not the biggest fan of the Crüe. And would watch it again.",The Dirt
312,fatistuta-19688,"10 of you're a fan, 7 for the neutral",10,22 March 2019,"If you've read the book then you know you can't fit it all in to 1hour 47mins of film. This so easily could have been a series or three, but it's a film and within that frame a lot of story has been covered.
A lot of the real dirt is missing but there's plenty there to keep everyone entertained.
The film moves at a really fast pace and if I'm totally honest plays out like a really long trailer because it has to cram so much in. The downside of this is that you don't have time to digest some of what you've seen before you are distracted with the next scene.
If I had to pick a fault with the film then the end is a bit rushed and could have done with another 30mins to go over details that were missed out.
If you've read the book then like me just accept the limitations of time constraints and enjoy the film for what it is.
If you haven't read the book, watch the film, don't take it too seriously, and then GO AND READ THE BOOK!
I've given it a ten on entertainment value for fun and nostalgia, but nothing can compare to the book and that should be kept in mind before viewing.",The Dirt

Tommy seemed a little subdued compared to what I think of him and Nikki can't really be that much of a whiner. I'm a HUGE fan of the early music and couldn't wait to watch tonight...

314,bicknelltodd,Definitely true to the book!,8,23 March 2019,"I was really happy with the way this movie was done. I'm glad they went with a narrative style.
If you read the book, you will understand and appreciate the movie allot more.
If you are looking for a movie about an 80s hair metal band and their crazy escapades, then this movie is not for you.
It's more to appreciate their historical story, which could only sadly be depicted in a short 107min. I think an 8 is fair. They could have went 120min.
Motley Crue is truly a band that will stay alive in music history!",The Dirt
315,simeonbrown-57433,A bit disappointing.,5,23 March 2019,"I got the book several years ago (the 10th anniversary edition) and loved it. While I was never a massive Motley Crue fan I grew up listening to metal in that era and was well aware of their notoriety. The book is a warts and all expose of the bands antics and off them as people. It's a fantastic read.And there's the first problem. The film is 1 hour 40minutes long. Three hours probably wouldn't be enough to do the story justice. It feels rushed and the timelines of certain events become jumbled. And that leads to the second problem.Certain key things in the book are glossed over. The recording of one entire album is ommited (Girl's, Girl's Girl's). The subsequent tour in the film is covered by a brief look at the band on a flight. This is the tour where the wheels really fell off. The Japanese part of the tour was completely ommited and shouldn't have been as by this point Tommy and Nikki were totally out of control. It was shortly after this part of the tour that Nikki overdosed but that wasn't the first time. His fall into an absolutely chronic heroin addiction feels rushed.The film doesn't really show how they changed as people enough either. Reading the book to go from liking Nikki to disliking him to kind of liking him again. Vince comes across as a self obsessed dick most of the time up until a personal tragedy. The film doesn't do enough to capture this but then doesn't have time to.Lastly This is a film about one of the most debauched bands ever. Yes the film shows sex, groupies and drug taking, but it still felt sanitised. They left a lot of stuff out. Definitely a missed opportunity.Overall it feels rushed. Credit for the portrayals of Sixx and Tommy though. If you know nothing of the band or very little then you'd probably like it. If you've read the book you might like me be a bit disappointed. It would have been better if it was twice as long. A shame I had been really looking forward to this.",The Dirt

It reminds me of an era that's long gone when we all had a really good time. You didn't have to worry about the cops. Drugs were good & so was the music. Yes, Motley is the Poster Child of the 80's ""Decade of Decadence"". Look & listen to the crap music of today. I'd go back in a second. I think the casting was superb. The actors definitely got the mannerisms correct. The choice in choosing relatively unknowns was also very smart. To those of you that don't like the movie, why did you watch it? You know curiosity killed the cat. I also don't care what they got wrong. It's not a PBS documentary. World has become so judgmental & negative all the time complaining.

322,tracyannjonestwo,A fun rock 'n' roll movie,9,24 March 2019,"Okay, so first up, I haven't read the book, but I am a fan of the band and heavy metal in general.The movie is well made, with good performances from the actors, especially the portrayals of Nikki Sixx and Tommy Lee. Of course, it contains all the stereotypical elements associated with bands (groupies, sex, drugs, questionable decisions during drug-and-alcohol-fueled benders), with the music being given its due importance. I personally felt it was a good mix.A lot of reviews have complained it doesn't do the book justice, and I get it. 9 times out of 10, it's disappointing to see a film falling short of the book's potential. But from someone who hasn't read the book, this definitely feels like it has a good flow to it.Anyone who is a fan of the band or even music of a similar genre should give it a watch. Good performances, good flow, good music. There's not much different from the regular rock band biopic, but this definately is a fun one to watch. Not a boring moment.",The Dirt

I am a Crue fan for sure and a big Nikki Sixx fan. I know they skipped the whole Girls Girls Girls erea.
That's when Nikki Sixx really started abusing Herion. Would have been a little better if they told more detail.
Wah The Dirt was longer. Was a really Good Movie. Enjoyed every minute of it. Now I am going to read the book.
Another Great read is Nikki Sixx's Herion Diaries Book. He should make a movie based on that book if you want a real look into his life.

327,saz-65208,Watched it 7 times already,10,29 March 2019,"So i was born in '87 so i missed the whole Mötley Crüe era. Found them at 15 and been hooked ever since (32 now). Read the book & Nikki's as well. Both amazing reads. As many fans know this movie has been talked about for YEARS some myslef included where maybe wondering if we would ever see it.
When the cast was released i only knew of Douglas Booth and Iwan Rheon. I started with the mind set of 'i wont judge anything until i see the trailer.' The trailer blew me away i watched it so many times. The casting for me was perfect, they all nailed the band espec MGK & Douglas Booth. You can tell from how they acted on screen they studied Nikki and Tommy. The opening of the movie sets the tone, if you read the book you know that same thing happens. Now it is a movie so some of the timeline is slightly off, and even though everything happened some of the acutal events happened differently. It had me laughing and crying. There are some heartbreaking moments. I know a lot of people have said it seems to be very Nikki centred....well yeh he was in the thick of it all the time. He wrote the songs and Mötley Crüe was his vision well before they ever existed as a band. Anyone who loves a band has a favourite member and mine is Nikki always has been so for me even though i have read his book the OD scene was a tough watch.
I think what people have to realise is the band where heavily involved in everything to do with it. I will keep watching it because i really enjoy the movie, waited so long for it and i am going to enjoy it over and over!🤘🏻

Should have been a mini series to fit 20+ years instead of an hour and half
The car accident scene was a glaring omission to why could have been a dark moment but was played off lightly, as was Nikki's drug abuse. Sure the band was carefree at the time but at absolutely no point did the ramifications of what was happening ever come
Across the screen as anything more than just a cheesy laugh.

331,endoftherepublic,Guilty Pleasure,7,28 March 2019,"I love this kind of movie and had a lot of fun watching this. Motley Crue (i am not going to take the time to figure out how to make those nifty dots that go over some of the letters of their name but you can pretend they are there if you like) is one of those bands i have always enjoyed but never really got into on an official basis. this seemed like, overall, an honest depiction of these people and seeing as they also produced it, i give them bonus points for keeping it real and omg - what absurdly crazy things these blokes did in their hayday. dude, can you imagine a band these days getting away with even a small fraction of this mayhem? no, today everyone (well, with the exception of our comander in chief) has to act like a proper, buttoned up employee of whatever the f-ck corporation is propping them up. this is not to say that i support any of the actions these dudes took that put other people's lives in danger (to put it lightly) but i do miss the freedom of the old, pre-smartphone days. Anyway, this movie was pretty good. Strong performances, espcially the blonde dude (who i knew i recognized from somewhere... PUNISHER!) who has a really good look in my opinion and i hope to see more of him on the big and small screens. the directing was a little bit mediocre and the script did not do anything to pump life or originality into this well trodden genre. that shot towards the end, that i keep seeing in trailers and posters, of the band approaching the stage lights and nickie six (sorry if i got the spelling wrong... i am not a fan as you know) looking back at the camera was super cliche and was probably the last factor that pushed this review from an 8 to a 7. with all that said, this was worth the watch and a savy business move on the part of the Crue (okay now i'm really curious about how to make those those cool double dots). their songs are all stuck in my head now. oh and i can't get that part where a certain someone (also a standout performance fyi) enhales something through his nose that is, let's just say, not coccain.",The Dirt
332,bmabee-90157,The Dirt,10,17 April 2019,"Docudramas already have an impossible task at hand: condense 15-20 years into 1.5 hours. This biopic got put on the backburner for nearly a decade because the original studio wasn't willing to stick their necks out in a PC world. I grew up an only child with no other choice than late 70s, all-80s and very early 90s rock everywhere I turned, and I'll admit, although Motley's Shout At the Devil cover beamed at me amongst all of my parents' cassette tapes, I never got turned onto them like I did GnR, Scorpions, Van Halen, etc. It was only when I was 18 and working my first bar job that the chef lent me The Heroin Diaries by Nikki Sixx, which quickly fuelled my spiral into Tommyland and The Dirt. The Dirt was a hefty read even for an addicted reader like myself, but I got through it in less than 36 hours. As I mentioned, Motley wasn't really on my radar musically, but after those three books, I was a diehard fan. A decade later, I maintain my fandom for the crue and all that goes along with it. The Dirt (the book) barely scratches the surface (google Chronological Crue by Paul Miles) and so of course, how could the Netflix biopic. There are so many details that only diehard Crueheads would notice, and I don't see a problem with that. They packed it all in, and the actors did an incredible job emulating their muses.

334,qzadravec,Great movie,8,31 March 2019,I personally haven't listened to to much Motley Crue in my lifetime but this movie opened my eyes to some of there music and I deffinetely got more in to the making of the movie and the background of why they did certain things I even watched a interview with Steveo from jackass who talked about his expirence with the band as a young adult would have liked to seen something like that incorporated into the movie but that's okay. The acting was pretty good for the most part one in particular that stood out to me was the role of tommy lee played by aspiring actor mgk (also known for his rap career) his perferomance in the dirt was much more complex then some of his more recent movie such as the bird box and I believe he handled the role he took very well. Nikki siggs played by Douglas booth was also very convincing as his role as Nikki siggs especially during the low points in his life it showed a lot about who Nikki was as a person. Daniel Webber played a very convincing performance as Vince neil his story really tugged at the heart strings.

I read book and there was so much that was left out and so much that could have been added. There is no connection with the characters and this movie played out like a cheaply made Lifetime special. The way they portrayed the dark events in the Motley Crue timeline was like there were no lasting effects. This could have been so much better and ended up being such a disappointment.

Through all their highs and extreme lows they managed to still rise in the end and be one of the truly greatest bands of all time.

Gives you that 80's vibe with a modern production spin (Stranger Things style). Some people say it's hard to empathize with the characters when tragedy hits them since the movie presents them as reckless kind of one-dimensional characters during the first part of the movie... I understand where they're coming from, but this wasn't my case! I ended up liking their music and their story a lot. Not all of it is told in the movie and it's not 100% accurate timeline-wise, but unless you already know the story you won't even notice (Coming from someone who knew very little about The Crüe before The Dirt). Btw, Colson Baker's depiction of Tommy Lee is UNCANNY! And the ""Day in the life"" scene is just great.",The Dirt
349,rachelgeller-10572,obsessed w/ this movie,10,21 May 2019,This movie has changed my life!!! Haha never was a huge fan of Mötley crue until this movie and now I love their music and have watched this movie about 15 times. Great work to all parts involved.,The Dirt

353,lilyymadden,BEST MOVIE I'VE WATCHED IN TIMES,10,21 May 2019,"We can't expect the entire life of the Crüe, line by line in less than 2 hours, ITS A FILM! The cast was excellent, that's good even for not fans, people can kill me but for me, The movie was better than Bohemian Rhapsody. I've seen in an unhealthy amount of times.",The Dirt
354,gregagorjan,"Great band, great story, great movie",10,21 May 2019,"I've read the book of course, it surely contains much more details than the movie has showed us.. but I understand, it's really hard to put 20 years of mayhem into a 2 hour movie. The movie is still very much on point and it shows us all the most important events from the band's life. It's a proper mixture of comedy, drama, serious issues and awesome music. The actors lived up to expectations and did a really good job impersonating each of their respected characters (I would like to point out MGK, who did the best job imo). My favourite scene was definitely Tommy telling us ""how life on the road is really like"". I've seen the movie 8 times already and I still can't get enough of it. Really worth the watch!
Thank you Mötley Crüe!",The Dirt

I always wish I had grown up in the 80's, especially in the rock/heavy metal era and this movie showed exactly what I would've imagined. All the actors did great, and now I can't stop learning more and more on Mötley Crüe.",The Dirt

I have read the books but to see this movie is next level. The casting was spot on. Just make sure the kids are not around when you watch it, guilty pleasure. Enjoy Crue Heads!",The Dirt

I encourage anyone who is and who is not a Crue fan to watch this movie...IT ROCKS!!",The Dirt
364,hshaw-31830,Almost Perfect,9,21 May 2019,"What can I say? Read the book, almost devouring it, now saw the film. Now granted this was not a ""Theatrical"" release, it was very close in following the book. The cast was great and the performance was nearly spot on. All in all I must say that was one of the best biopic films that I have seen in a while. I would strongly recommend it if you are a fan of bio pics. Even if you are not a fan of bio pics I would strongly recommend it",The Dirt
365,dennisvelarde-32965,No words to describe this movie,10,21 May 2019,This is something that many Motley fans were expecting to watch. The film tries to describe the crazy experiencies of our heroes during their time of success and decadence. It's just a fantastic movie.,The Dirt
366,randich-68178,The best rock movie,10,21 May 2019,"The best rock movie of recent times I've seen! Very good cinematographic production, the music enters the perfect moment, the adaptation and characterization are spectacular. More than satisfied!",The Dirt

368,avabaskerville,How are there bad reviews???,10,21 May 2019,"This movie is an absolute master piece. Even if you dont like the band or the music it was nostalgic and great from start to finish. They had to fit a lot into an almost 2 hour time frame I'd say they did a superb job. Highly recommended, dont listen to the bad press.",The Dirt
369,rockthehair,All Time Favorite Movie!!,10,21 May 2019,"If you lived the 80's Rock era, Best Era Ever!!! You will relate on so many levels! The actors were spot on, from the clothes, The walk, Talk, mannerisms. From the Crue to Razzle to the MTV VJ Kennedy!!! Their Apartment Parties were so 80's, Reminded me of our after work parties except we weren't rockstars :) Well Done Boys!! Well done!!!",The Dirt
370,jackipoo,I love it.,10,23 May 2019,Amazing movie. I fell in love with the Crüe after watching this. They produced amazing music and they also had the most insane lives. HIGHLY RECCOMEND!!,The Dirt
371,beckyann-44001,Not disappointed,10,21 May 2019,I read the book twice and not disappointed in the movie. It stayed true to the story even if it left out stuff and rewrote stuff in the process.,The Dirt

373,tlhales,Amazing!!,10,21 May 2019,I have watched this film at least a dozen times now and I absolutely love it! I have been a long time Motley Crue fan and I was so excited to see The Dirt. I've read the book and I think although there is quite a bit missing in the movie that they still did a great job putting the film together. The actors are great too! It's definitely worth watching!,The Dirt
374,rkavanaugh-60074,I lived my dream through them,9,21 May 2019,"I was a teenager growing up on the other side of North America in a small town in Nova Scotia. They spoke to me in their music and I was on board from the beginning. This movie is everything i wanted to be doing, other than the tragedy and heartbreak. If you love the rock/metal music of the 80's, this movie is GREAT. Captured the times perfectly and brought me back to when life was simple. The Crue made music matter to me. Thank you!",The Dirt
375,kmack-71675,Wild&Crazy!!!,10,21 May 2019,"Ok, so I've been a crue head since I 1st heard that garage sound of Live Wire!! Still one of my favorite Crüe songs! I've been waiting for this movie since I read the book when it 1st came out! It did not disappoint!! Truly wish it was longer, I've watched it 3 times, and my only negative of it was having to see Vince go thru losing his daughter. Didnt remember that part, hard to watch. But over all it was a necessity for the movie. All the guys did a great job portraying there character! So Hey Sixx, when does Heroin diaries gonna be put on the big screen!?",The Dirt
376,manrward,Brings back memories!,10,21 May 2019,Absolutely love Motley Crue! So much I named my first born Nikki 😂. The Dirt was way better than I expected with it being a Netflix movie!! It just made me want more!!! Go back on tour guys!!!,The Dirt
377,kbug-62066,Awesome,10,21 May 2019,"I love this movie 27 times so far! It highlights the lives of the infamous rockers and their addictions as well as the ups and downs of the band as a whole. It outlines their notorious, infamous and outrageous lifestyles! A must see!!!",The Dirt

379,nygiantsfan-58566,Addicted to this movie...,10,22 May 2019,"Can't stop watching this. The addiction is real. The cast, directing, acting, writing, costumes...ALL are just a triumph. Iwan, Daniel, Douglas, and MGK have their respective characters down cold. There is magic that they all have. They create this burning nostalgia in you and you just can't get enough! As a life long Crüe fan, I fell in love all over again! It is a whole extra level experience if you are a Motley fan. The ONLY movie we watch over and over all the way through the credits. Better than Bohemian! It of course took some liberties from the book but it's pretty spot on, too. The new tracks are awesome! #TheDirt will make you dust off the deep tracks and your leathers. #GimmeTheDirt",The Dirt
380,mrzeigler-97918,Absolutely worth the wait!,10,22 May 2019,"I have read the book, I've read all of Nikki's books. I was and have been beyond excited to know that ""The Dirt"" was going to be a movie. The wait for the movie was excruciating but well worth the conflicting excitement and agony of having to wait. Any Crue fan I know has been referred to watch it, and I will forever rate this movie 10/10.",The Dirt
381,rcorsaw,Love Love Love,10,22 May 2019,Wait did I mention I love it. I lost count around the 20th time I watched it or was that after something happened in Seattle. The bottom line is the movie brings you back to the 80's and time you may have forgotten or for the younger generation are learning about. The portrayal of all the band members was spot on. Can't stop watching it!,The Dirt
382,stevepalexander,Awesome movie,10,22 May 2019,Any cruehead loves this movie I found it very entertaining and the cast was picked well. The remix of live wire in the climax was very well done,The Dirt

384,cwbyfan,Don't waste your time!,1,22 May 2019,"Horrible movie badly done!
I want the time I wasted on it back.
Biggest problem to me is it focuses on the the sensational while failing to benchmark their epic success.
The Crue blazed an epic path through rock but this Rockumentary focuses on the idiotic moments.",The Dirt

387,nikkicork,WATCH IT,10,22 May 2019,I watched this movie on a whim (my husband & I really enjoy music bio-pics) not knowing anything about Motley Crue. Then we watched again the next night and I watched AGAIN the following week. This movie is so fun to watch! Great story. Great script. Great acting. Solid movie all around.

This movie helped me discover other motley crue songs other than girls girls girls, doctor feel goos, shout at the devil and smoking in the boys room. I watched Amercan Satan and this movie right after each other I felt that American Satan slightly ripped off the Dirt. But that's just me.",The Dirt

Looking forward to watching it again!",The Dirt
396,jovimikejon,As good as it gets,9,23 May 2019,Well watched this movie not so long ago. It was one of the greatest movies I have ever watched. The cast gave their best and was so similar to the band members. And of course the production helped a lot. Congratulations!!!!,The Dirt
397,facebookjunk-61927,Amazing!,10,23 May 2019,I have seen this movie about 7 times and I can not get enough! It inspired me to read the book of the same name and let me tell you well worth the read. I laughed and cried reading the book and watching the movie. It made me respect them and rediscover their wonderful music. I'm 27 so I never lived though any of the 1980's but I have grown up with the music.,The Dirt

399,kuroishix,Don't mistake this for documentary,5,24 May 2019,"I wasn't expecting much from this movie, hell, it's a movie based on a book written by Mötley Crüe about Mötley Crüe, and this is more or less what I imagined in my head after seeing the promotional material.I don't mind that it is a bit disjointed, quite stylistically messy at times and that it takes a bunch of liberties telling a more compact story. However, it does kinda bother me that they made all the people involved a lot less horrible than they actually were in real life, it would make for a more serious and a lot more depressing story, but drama with a touch of psychological on the side would probably make for one objectively better movie.It does have its moments, I even laughed a few times and showed some parts to my girlfriend so it surely isn't all bad. I enjoyed my time with it and it was a nice movie to throw on Netflix just to pass some time. Also, it looks like Machine Gun Kelly had a lot of fun being in this and that must count for something.",The Dirt
400,fabrizio_amanda,I binge this over and over,10,25 May 2019,"I saw the trailer for this, and it was on my watch list. I was freakin hooked after the first main scene.

After reading the books i do wish the movie portrayed the band a little more accurately, especially nikki.

i was definitely born in the wrong era!!
i have a new love for rock music now",The Dirt

408,cskmom-99281,Wowza!,10,15 June 2019,"If you were around in the 80's, you'll like seeing all the nostalgic nods, from t-shirts to restaurants, cars to hairstyles. If you were a fan of Motley music, it will resonate deep into your veins. As a huge fan from their very first album & throughout all these years, I'd have to say that the only way this film could have been more detailed is if it had been made into a miniseries. There's just no way more life experiences could have been packed into an hour and a half! The movie gives you no downtime to go get yourself a bowl of popcorn or a bathroom break. Something exciting or important to their story is happening every minute!",The Dirt
409,apauliesgirl,This movie is not just for Crüe fans,10,15 June 2019,This movie is only a brief glimpse into the making of this iconic band.

It's a true story about a group of brothers banded together, stuck together through lifes worst and still pulled out on top. That is what family means, blood or not.

But, if you are ready so sit down, remove your brain and just be entertained with a great soundtrack and a glimpse into 80's rock n roll excess then you will absolutely love it.
I thought they got the band members bang on. Especially Tommy Lee. He was superb.And if you haven't read the book then this should hopefully be an incentive to go and get it. You won't be disappointed.",The Dirt

Then I bought the book, I'm in the middle and this movie has left out so much detail and story already. But you know as usual Netflix isn't the best when it comes to movies.

It was a treat to see lives that were lived without a single rule. This was so fun to watch. I really recommend it. It's not something you'd see every day. I'm now a huge fan of Mötley crüe. Love them! It's raw and absolutely shocking and different.,The Dirt
431,lydiaohmanwolf,Waste of time,1,8 May 2021,"Despite fans giving this movie good reviews trust me, this movie was a waste of time. A bands attempt to make their repellent behavior look flattering and rebellious. Kinda pathetic. Very disappointed.",The Dirt

434,stephenjerrome,Take a walk on the wild side,8,23 March 2019,Very gritty biopic of one of heavy metals most notorious bands Motley Crue.Recounts some (but not all) of the bands controversial tales.Some brilliant dark humour as well as some heartfelt moments.Had me totally hooked and the only fault I could find is that it could have been longer and spent more time addressing certain situations.,The Dirt
435,Kaccedi,The Dirt is right,4,24 March 2019,"It was okay, once you could get over the fact that the guys in the movie looked nothing like the Crue. They completely had the timeline of events wrong in this movie. Sharise was nowhere near being in the picture when Vince had his car wreck. Skylar wasn't born when they said she was in the movie. He had children then, Neil & Beth (also one named Christopher outside of relationships). Also, Tommy & Heather's wedding was in the wrong year, and they completely left out Decade of Decadence, and The Moscow Music Peace Festival (When Heather actually hooked up with Richie Sambora, and Doc McGhee was fired).Mick did have a great relationship that should have been at least mentioned, with Emi.Just like most of the other reviews, I have to agree, more time was needed to tell the complete story.",The Dirt
436,undeadnbloody,"Starts amazing, then loses its shine",7,23 March 2019,"I've listened to Motley Crue for years. I know all their songs and all the main parts of their history. I've watched their gigs in full, I've read Nikki Sixx' Heroin Diaries, listened to Vince Neil's solo stuff, as well as everything by Sixx AM.
This movie has been in the works for many years, then it was suddenly around the corner, at a time when I had listened to Crue songs so many times that they were not on my playlist anymore.I knew the actor behind Vince Neil from The Punisher where he played a mentally disturbed soldier, nothing like Vince, so I didn't think he'd do well. I haven't watched a single episode of Game of Thrones but I knew the actor behind Mick Mars from Inhumans, so I had no idea what to expect from him.Now that the above is out of the way, I can say that the movie did a great job at being true to the band's history and everything about Motley Crue. The looks of the band members were accurate and their personalities were recognizable. Even the small details like Nikki's Thunderbird at the band's practice, or Tommy's constant use of words like ""babe"" and ""dude"" were there as well. Mick's endless grumpiness was also perfectly displayed by the actor.The movie was a total blast of joy from the start to about the middle of it. I'd rate it 9 or 10 for that. Then the pacing changed completely, as if it were from an absolutely different director. The turning point was the death of Razzle, which sadly felt disrespertful to the real person because of his brief appearance in the movie, making his death almost feel like nothing rather than the actual loss of a unique individual and musician whose life was taken by the actions a careless drunk. The following events weren't given enough attention either. It's like the people behind the movie excel at projecting the moods of fun and debauchery, but they fall short of projecting the weight of sadness or desperation, because the second part involved so much loss but it could not be felt - what we got then was a number of almost boring and uneventful scenes. The ending was great but extremely short.",The Dirt

I was in high school from 1981 - 1985 so lived it. My buddies and I saw the Crue on their first tour when they opened for Ozzy. They truly blew the roof off the old Rosemont Horizon outside of Chicago. They were bold, loud, rude but had catchy songs and tremendous stage presence. The movie captures this era of the band in all its raunchy glory. I especially enjoyed the origin story and how these four unique, unlikely rock stars came together to form something fresh and unique. Yes, the second half of the movie drags somewhat but all together, it's a movie worth watching for fans and non-fans alike.",The Dirt

454,mikaelbjornson-373-43351,How is it even possible to make this story this BOORING?,1,28 March 2019,"So you have all the ingredients: a cast of famous self-destructive characters with a fair amount of darkness in and around them; a true American success story with all the trimmings ; a well-known, iconic team of rock n' roll teens in a well-known, iconic setting full of well known, iconic supporting characters and events. You have a full spice rack of drugs, sex, rock-n-roll, humour, tragedy, a fair budget and decent actors. And a HUGE pot.
And then you make a stew that barely has any taste, a slight greyish appearance and zero aftertaste, bitter or otherwise. You need to be a profoundly talentless cook like Jeff Tremaine to pull it off.
I don't think I've EVER seen someone drop the ball so totally before. It's embarrassing. And it's not even really provocative that it's so bad, because it's just boring.The camera work, lightning and editing is just lame. Like something out of a high school film class. The script is bereft of all depth and complexities. The acting is embarrasingly bad and nothing, really nothing makes you feel anything. The tragedies are just shallow acts of crying and the humour is just locker-room laughter. Tremaine even succeeds in making the success story utterly flat and uneventful- and I'm a sucker for success stories.To boot, it's full of shamelessly stolen scenes and strategemes. The Adrenalin-shot-to-the-heart-scene from Pulp Fiction, the character-breaks-the-forth-wall-to-comment-on-the-truthfulness-of-the-scene from Wolf of Wall Street ... really, Tremaine, don't you have any ideas of your own? If you do, maybe you should try putting them in your movies? Oh, and your internship as director is overdue. You will not be considered for further employment, but there might be a job for you on a McDonalds. But do try and make the burgers actually TASTE anything, will you?",The Dirt

Unlike others I loved the narration style, but especially the second half felt very rushed. There should have been more on Razzels death and Vince Neil's daughter and him leaving/rejoining. Sixx's addiction issues did not have enough time for you to feel how dark it really was for. In regards to almost everything about Tommy's disaster of a life being left out, I can only assume that he was not willing to show any if it as this would paint him a very bad light. Fair play they have shown a lot of things that make them look like the arsholes they were, but Tommy Lee is a different story.",The Dirt

The book definitely has more detail but for a book turned into a movie you couldn't ask for a better one! I'm my opinion when watching the film you feel like the actors are the real people re-living theirs lives, telling their story.

I would've like to see a little bit more character development, as the only character I really felt like we saw develop was Nikki and it was his charisma and dream that kept the band going and that part was great to me to see.

If you like sex, drugs, & rock n' roll, and like watching movies about sex, drugs, & rock n' roll. You will love The Dirt as much as I did. Shout at the Devil!!!",The Dirt
514,contact-21164,Great inside in a band.,9,22 March 2019,I have listen to Mötley since the middle of the 80'ts and always been one of my favorite bands. This movie gives another depth to the music that I didn't know before. So lucky that I saw the live and hope that they will come back.!,The Dirt
515,jennay-93515,Great flick... Could have picked a better actor to play Vince!,8,23 March 2019,"I enjoyed it..even though I read the book. Machine Gun Kelly played a great Tommy Lee! Booth played an amazing Nikki Sixx and Ramsey from GoT was a great Mars..but Vince..not so great. His lip synching was so off..as was his acting. And Pete Davidson..awkward af. Stick to stand up, my dude. Movie overall was pretty awesome!",The Dirt
516,amithyst-69547,awesome movie!,10,26 March 2019,I thought it was great! reminded me of my youth. who didn't love motley crue as a kid?!!! we all did!! true a lot was packed into such a short time but it had heart and it was very good! laughter and tears were well worth it for this movie :) I am glad I got to see them and so many other bands from that era play when I was younger :) thank god for metal! :) keep it rocking! :),The Dirt

518,yogunime_japan,"I would watch it again, and again, and again...",10,23 May 2019,"After the revolution of the Queen Movie, you could think that any movie about a band couldn't be as good as Bohemian Rhapsody, but The Dirt surprised me in every way.
It's emotive, it's fun, it's AWESOME...
I cried and I laughed... omg how i laughed.
The actors were amazing. You could fall in love with everyone of them.
I definitively watch it again, and again, and again...",The Dirt

520,codyhelton,Long wait was worth it,10,21 May 2019,"The movie was worth the wait! Although most would've liked a longer, more detailed story line, that's what the book is for. The movie captures the grit of the book and compacts it into a short story. Definitely worth a watch or ten.",The Dirt
521,tafranklin-48935,A Netflix low,2,24 March 2019,"This film had so much potential but in the end, it failed. The casting is dreadful and it's clearly just a load of men in wigs who have never played an instrument in their life (bar MGK). The guitarist doesn't even bother moving his fingers for the solo of shout at the devil. The portrayal of a younger Ozzy Osbourne was cringe worthy with yet another terrible casting decision. The film just attempts a shock factor through drugs and sex, but it's just a cheesy mess of unnecessary narration and random time good. Netflix worst film to date",The Dirt
522,dinna-78388,Great movie,10,21 May 2019,"Totally worth the wait, but just little too short 😁",The Dirt
523,mitchellhageman,Wolf of Wall Street meets Bohemian Rhapsody,10,22 March 2019,"This is probably the best film Netflix has produced to date. Absolutely perfect casting, breakneck pacing and an all out good time. Focusing on the highs and lows of the group, it'll make you really wanna see a motley Crüe show just for the pure insanity of it. An origin story for the ages, rivalling if not bettering bohemian rhapsody. Not for the faint of heart though, be prepared for a myriad of drugs, sex and rocknroll.",The Dirt
524,linford-63367,Loved!!,10,10 April 2019,This film takes me right back to my youth and I just loved it! They chose the actors well and their interpretation of the Crue has been so well done. I'm now listening to MC as much as I used to. You can never kill Rock n Roll.,The Dirt
525,jalex-86121,Marginal at best,4,24 March 2019,After reading the dirt many years ago and waiting a long time for the movie to come out I was disappointed that they cut out a lot of important details. They cast the boys well but other than that it was rushed.,The Dirt

528,obridget-21098,"Fun, happy, sad, shocking, overall great nostalgia for us 80's kids",8,23 March 2019,"They did a really good job of showing the debauchery of the Crue during those times. I also thought each member's life story was represented evenly, except for Mick Mars, who probably wanted to remain more private.Great concert and party scenes, although the girl squirting across the room was a shock, lol.One issue I do have is I wish they did NOT show up-close, slow-motion scenes of Nikki Sixx shooting up heroin, multiple times. I thought if a teen wants to learn how to do it, just watch this.Overall, I enjoyed reminiscing about my growing up during the 80's and partying in Hollywood. Fun times, and I made it out alive.",The Dirt
529,j_a-11407,Great music-thanks idiots,7,23 November 2019,I guess this was what it took. Hard to believe I have seen them 3 times live. What a bunch of morons. Don't tour again. You made a great mark. Leave it alone idiots. Let it rest in rock history. We loved you but it has been done for awhile now. Mahalo kiddos,The Dirt
530,artlissa,Love it!,10,22 May 2019,"This is such a great movie! The acting is perfect. All the sarcasm is awesome. Very touching stories. I laughed and cried. They really captured the humanity in the group. Watched this over 8 times, and it is still entertaining.",The Dirt

535,marcelobolso,Mötley Crüe amazing story!,10,26 March 2019,"Please, someone explain to the few haters who say that this movie is bad that it is impossible to put every detail of a book with more than 400 pages full of spectacular anecdotes in a two-hour movie! Of course there are missing things, of course some dates are arranged to fit well into the movie ... so what? The film is great, it's fun, it's emotional, it's two hours that you do not realize how fast it went, because you enjoy every moment, because it's like a roller coaster that you enjoy like crazy, it flies by and when you realize it's over and you're left wanting more.
It was one of the greatest bands of heavy metal / rock in history, four guys with such different personalities and with so much talent each of them, that was what made the band so special and unique. Musically they were monsters, leaders of a whole metal movement in Los Angeles, they influenced hundreds of new bands that came later, some very good, some just good and others very bad, but they were the ones who led the way. They wrote unforgettable hymns, metal songs for headbangin non-stop, party rock and rollers of those that put you in a good mood right away, incredible ballads, great covers ... to all that add the wild, crazy, and that I-don't-give-a-damn attitude they had and we have the perfect mix, that was Mötley Crüe! As I said before, there's always something missing, that song you wanted to hear and it's not there, that anecdote that was your favorite in the book and it's not there either, but if you're a fan of Mötley, if you grew up in the 80s listening to them and idolizing them, if you were one of those who after watching one of their music videos or concerts you stayed with a smile of satisfaction on your face thinking ""these guys are the best""... you will enjoy this film for sure, and if you're not one of those, you'll know a little bit about how life was for the wildest band in the world. So watch it, crank up the volume, laugh, get angry, cry and get excited. You will finish with the sensation that you wanted it to last two hours more!
Mötley Crüe forever!",The Dirt

537,keithcreamer,Worth the watch but poorly made,7,29 March 2019,The Motley Crue have a story worth telling and for that I recommend watching it. The niration was weak and it felt with so many brilliant story's they had to rush it along a bit. Probably didn't celebrate their music enough either. One thing I will do is get the book because these boys were insane and I really enjoyed the appetite they had for chaos.,The Dirt
538,nette-86778,Awesome movie!!,10,24 March 2019,"I thought this movie was awesome!! Netflix did a great job with this one. As with any movie based on a book or true events, you can't include everything and some things will be dramatized. Knowing that, it's a great movie for fans and non-fans. It's ridiculous but so was Motley Crue in the 80s. This is one of my new favs-I've already watched it 2 times in 2 days.",The Dirt
539,dididall,Worth the wait!,10,24 March 2019,I was counting the days and it was worth it!!! Loved it and even if you're not a fan it turns you into a fan it's a great movie with amazing music.,The Dirt

544,nick_legge,"Not a fan of the band, but loved it!",9,1 April 2019,"My wife wanted to watch this and since it was mothers day, I reluctantly agreed.You've got to watch this film with a smile on your face and realise it's got a heavy dose of Wayne's World in there, but it's Wayne's World on drugs!I really enjoyed this film and I'm glad I didn't watch it with my kids - way too embarrassing for that with a lot of sex and drugs and general OTT debauched behaviour.",The Dirt

Better than Bohemian Rhapsody, better than the Mayhem movie Lords Of Chaos.

Colson Baker sold his role so well! I hope to see more of that guy!

Daniel Webber does good crying scenes and orgasm faces.
Iwan Rheon is a genius9/10",The Dirt
550,mdevr,Great fun,8,31 March 2019,"I knever knew that much about the Mötley Crüe, but this movie sparked my interest in the band. So I did some research, since I have always liked to look into the background of music, movies, actors and so on. One hell of a story that is if you like the genre offcourse. 4 Guys from different backgrounds become almost family to eachother, like brothers. They are trying hard to hit it big as rockstars. they deal with all kinds of personal issues, all while they also abuse copious amounts of alcohol and drugs. Solid acting and just a fun ride with great music. My personal opinion is that you don't have to like the music to like the movie. There are plenty of other things going on to keep you entertained. I watched it with a few good friends, one of them dislikes rock but really enjoyed the movie. This movie made me appreciate the Mötley Crue more and maybe even a fan. My rating: 8/10",The Dirt
551,fnicholas-56793,It's a fun bio to watch one of the greatest rock and roll band of all time,10,23 March 2019,"A bit of introspection would heighten the experience and deepen the characters, but Tremaine leans on familiar themes of tribal unity to glaze over the thinner sections of the script and it's a delightfully disreputable biopic about some of rock's last true bad boys.",The Dirt

As talented a band as Queen was, they seemed like a bunch of boring doorknobs. This movie is pure sex, drugs, and chaos. But eventually their demise brings a very real tone to the movie with a lot to take away. Entertaining from start to finish and pretty well made. However, as a huge fan of the band I wish their was more emphasis on the music. They touched on Theatre of Pain and their huge effort on Dr. Feelgood as a newly sober band. The Album Girls, Girls wasn't mentioned at all which doesnt make a lot of sense. The title track was used for a montage but thats about it.",The Dirt
