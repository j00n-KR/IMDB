0,MartinHafer,It's okay...but I am not the target audience.,6,8 November 2019,"A group of brightly colored slug-like animated creatures want to take all the Looney Tunes characters back to their planet. However, Bugs convinces them to give them an opportunity to win their freedom and so he challenges them to a basketball game...not knowing that the slugs were not averse to a lot of cheating. After stealing the talents from some of the best NBA players, it's just the Looney Tunes characters AND Michael Jordan against the super-nasty slugs.A friend of mine, Angelo, insisted that I should watch ""Space Jam"", as it's apparently a movie he loves. Well, on his insistence I watched the movie and found it mildly enjoyable and not much more. On the other hand, I am NOT the target audience, as I am not a basketball fan and I like my Looney Tunes cartoons like they were long ago...without all the modern sensibilities and CGI. This really is NOT a slam against the film...I am sure a lot of younger folks would enjoy it and the film made a lot of money (especially abroad). For me, it just didn't resonate and if I want to see a film that integrates cartoons with real life, I'd rather see ""Who Framed Roger Rabbit"".",Space Jam
1,TheLittleSongbird,"Silly and somewhat juvenile, but entertaining for what it is",7,21 February 2010,"I notice that there are people who like ""Space Jam"", but others who don't so much. While I think it has flaws, I think it is an entertaining and energetic film, not as good as ""Who Framed Roger Rabbit"" and ""Looney Tunes:Back in Action"" but an entertaining movie for Looney Tunes and basketball lovers(I admit I am more of a Looney Tunes fan). The story is a very nice idea, but there were parts when it was rather juvenile, likewise with some of the dialogue. Michael Jordan is a great athlete, and his skills are put to great use, but his acting isn't as impressive, it seems as though he is playing himself at times. Flaws aside, it is very funny with some great jokes and constant energy, and excellent supporting characters. Bill Murray, wearing clothes that you shouldn't ideally wear on a golf course, steals every scene he's in, and Danny DeVito is great fun as evil Swackhammer. The Looney Tunes are hilarious, especially Daffy, and technically with all the radiant colours the film works wonders. Overall, I like ""Space Jam"", it isn't Oscar worthy material, but it is fun to watch. 7/10 Bethany Cox",Space Jam
2,Leofwine_draca,Good animation - shame about the rest,4,14 September 2021,"Hardly WHO FRAMED ROGER RABBIT?, is it? I had the misfortune to see this at the cinema at the age of 15 and already I was too old for the twee antics. The sports scenes are dullish and the mugging cameo stars are quite the embarassment; the less said about the 'acting' of the sports professionals the better. The animation's okay, but that's about it.",Space Jam
3,SnoopyStyle,Michael Jordan and Bugs Bunny,5,22 June 2015,"Michael Jordan is playing baseball and really sucks at it. Swackhammer is the owner of the amusement park planet Moron Mountain and he needs new attractions. His underlings arrive on Earth to take Bugs Bunny and the rest of the gang back as prisoners. Bugs trick the tiny aliens into playing basketball for their freedom. However the aliens steal the talents of the greatest NBA star to become basketball monsters. While playing golf with Bill Murray and Larry Bird, Jordan is taken by Bugs to join their team.One has to compare and contrast this to 'Who Framed Roger Rabbit'. There is no excuse for this but the animation looks cheaper. There is some CGI but it's in its early form. It looks like a 90s TV cartoon and doesn't really hold up. There is a more timeless quality about Roger Rabbit. Then there is Jordan. This is very much a vehicle for Jordan but it doesn't make him a good actor. There is really no acting in this. As a pop artifact, it's kind of interesting to see but it's not a good movie. It's mostly for kiddie Jordan fans back in the day.",Space Jam
4,kosmasp,Hit em high (low),7,16 July 2021,"What a soundtrack ... I just rewatched this to be ready for the new one ... and wow! I was quite blown away by all the songs on this, that I almost had forgotten about too. I've watched the new one too and while for me MJ is the one (you can feel differently about that, we can have different feelings on who is the GOAT, it's all good), when it comes to acting ... well LeBron is better for sure.That being said, in a movie like this, there is not much you have to do acting wise. What I did like is that MJ does not take himself too seriously. While he has serious moments in there - the sub story with his dad, that I am certain was very important to him - maybe not so important to viewers who are unaware, but it's a nice touch for sure - overall this is a funny affair.Add to that some really good actors who have some hits and misses with their jokes (I love Bill Murray, but certain scenes did not age well) - of course this completely ridiculous story (or shall I say ... ""looney""?) is aimed at a younger audience. A now maybe grown up audience that went ahead and watched the new one with their kids. It's been 25 years since this was released.There is some lessons to be learned here ... but overall you should watch it with a grain of salt .. and a lot of suspension of disbelief.",Space Jam
5,classicsoncall,"""Hold on there, Mr. Looney Tune.""",7,8 October 2016,"The film's twenty years old already, man, how time does fly by. I grew up watching the Looney Tunes characters back in the Fifties, so for me, that's what kids cartoons are all about. Bugs Bunny and Daffy Duck were my favorites, and they have prominent roles here, so that was cool. Having been away so long from the shows I watched as a kid, the presence of Lola Bunny was a bit of a surprise, I had never seen her before, or at least the iteration of her here wasn't familiar to me. Because all of the original voice artists are gone, folks like Mel Blanc and Chuck Jones, the Warner Brothers characters sounded just the slightest bit off to me, but that's a minor nuisance. Teaming up the cartoon characters with professional basketball players was a uniquely creative concept, though I would have liked to see some of the other players like Barkley and Ewing in the Monstar game themselves. But no matter, this is a colorful flick with decent animation and humor, with cool appearances by Wayne Knight and Bill Murray. Murray was effective doing his type of character from ""Groundhog Day"", a slovenly but decent guy who can make you laugh just by looking at him.",Space Jam
6,lee_eisenberg,I still say that there's always reason to be doubtful about any of what they produced after Mel Blanc died.,5,24 March 2007,"What made the classic Looney Tunes cartoons so great was their clever stories (with occasional social commentary) and their avoidance of gross commercialism; and of course there were Mel Blanc's voices. It seems like everything that they produced after his death was mostly really corporate. I'll admit that ""Space Jam"" is pretty entertaining, as Michael Jordan comes to the rescue of Bugs, Daffy, Porky, etc., after some aliens try to kidnap them. But aside from the over-emphasis on Jordan himself, it seems like this movie was just trying to sell a bunch of things (not to mention that the voices don't sound right without Mel Blanc). And if it was intended for young children, then some of what it showed wasn't particularly appropriate for children, namely the ""nice butt"" scene.So, it's OK as straight entertainment. But you'll do far better to just stick with the classic cartoons. Also starring Wayne Knight, Bill Murray and the voice of Danny DeVito.",Space Jam
7,jboothmillard,Space Jam,6,20 September 2005,"I watched this live-action cartoon hybrid twice in the cinema when I was a child, and subsequently many more times on video, and I'm glad I got to watching it again when I was grown up. Basically, basketball star Michael Jordan (as himself) has had a tremendous career, but in 1993 he announced his retirement from professional basketball to pursue a career in baseball. Meanwhile, in outer space, the owner of amusement park Moron Mountain, Mr. Swackhammer (Danny DeVito), wants new attractions. After seeing them on television, he sends his minions, the Nerdlucks, to Earth to abduct the Looney Tunes. Arriving in the cartoon world, Bugs Bunny (Billy West) and the other animated characters manipulate the aliens into giving them a chance to defend themselves for their freedom. The Tunes take advantage of their small stature and challenge them to a game of basketball. The Nerdlucks watch a documentary to find out about the game and learn about the sport's best players at the NBA (National Basketball Association). To gain an advantage, the aliens go around various basketball games and steal the talents of NBA players Charles Barkley, Shawn Bradley, Patrick Ewing, Larry Johnson, and Muggsy Bogues (as themselves). This transforms the small aliens into larger, muscular, and talented basketball-playing monsters, dubbed the Monstars. The Tunes are petrified of their competition, prompting Bugs to seek professional help. While playing golf with Bill Murray, Larry Bird, and his personal assistant, Stan Podolak (Wayne Knight), Jordan is suddenly lassoed down a hole and into the world of the Looney Tunes. Bugs explains the situation to Jordan, who is there only hope, being on the best basketball players in the world. Jordan is reluctant, having been retired for some time, but he changes his mind after being intimidated by the Monstars. Meanwhile, the basketball stars who have had their talents stolen are subjected to numerous medical tests and therapy, while the NBA are panicked and suspend basketball indefinitely for the season. Jordan tries to train his cartoon team, the ""Tune Squad"". A new talent recruited to the team is a female bunny named Lola (Kath Soucie), whom Bugs falls in love with. Jordan sends Bugs and Daffy Duck (Dee Bradley Baker) back to his house to obtain his basketball gear. When they arrive, Bugs and Daffy meet Jordan's dog and kids, and are later seen by Stan, who follows them back to the cartoon world and joins the team as well. The game between the Tune Squad and the Monstars eventually begins, but the Monstars dominate the first half, sinking the Tune Squad's morale. Stan overhears how the Monstars obtained their talent and informs Jordan and the team. Using a bottle of water labelled ""Michael's Secret Stuff"", Bugs and Michael trick and rally the Tune Squad to regain their confidence and dominate the second half using old-school gags and Acme weaponry. During a timeout, Jordan raises the stakes with Swackhammer. If the Tune Squad win, they give the NBA players their talent back, but if the Monstars, the aliens get Jordan, to become their new star attraction for Moron Mountain for the rest of his life, and they shake hands on the deal. Swackhammer subsequently orders the Monstars to win by any means necessary; they subsequently begin playing even dirtier and rougher against the Tune Squad than before, leaving most of them injured and unable to continue. Stan brought into the game as a fifth player also fails to help. With ten seconds left in the game, the Tune Squad are down by one point and one player, with only Jordan, Bugs, Lola, and Daffy still able to play. Murray unexpectedly arrives and is recruited to fill the spot. In the final seconds, Jordan gains the ball with Murray's help but is pulled back by the Monstars. Remembering advice from Bugs, he uses cartoon physics to extend his arm and dunk the ball, winning the match before the buzzer sounds. After watching Swackhammer being nasty the Monstars, Jordan helps them realise that they only listened to him because they were smaller. The Monstars encase Swackhammer in a missile and send him back to his amusement park. The Nerdlucks give up their talents, as part of the deal, and ask to stay with the Looney Tunes. They also fly their spaceship to drop off Jordan at his next baseball game. Later, Jordan visits the incapacitated basketball players and returns their talents. The players jokingly suggest that Jordan can no play basketball. But two years later, in 1995, Jordan returns to the Chicago Bulls to resume his basketball career. Also starring Theresa Randle as Juanita Jordan, Manner Washington as Jeffrey Jordan, Eric Gordon as Marcus Jordan, Penny Bae Bridges as Jasmine Jordan, Thom Barry as James R. Jordan Sr., and Charles Hallahan as Baron's Owner, with the voices of Billy West as Elmer Fudd, Dee Bradley Baker as the Tazmanian Devil, Bob Bergen as Hubie & Bertie / Marvin the Martian / Porky Pig / Tweety, Bill Farmer as Sylvester / Yosemite Sam / Foghorn Leghorn, June Foray as Granny, Maurice LaMarche as Pepe Le Pew, Jocelyn Blue as Nerdluck Pound, Charity James as Nerdluck Blanko, June Melby as Nerdluck Bang, Catherine Reitman as Nerdluck Bupkus, Colleen Wainwright as Nerdluck Nawt, Dorian Harewood as Monstar Bupku, Joey Camen as Monstar Bang, T. K. Carter as Monstar Nawt, Darnell Suttles as Monstar Pound, Steve Kehela as Monstar Blanko, and Frank Welker as Charles the Dog. Jordan is charismatic enough playing himself as the determined team leader, Murray gets his funny moments, Knight is likeable as the dorkish assistant, and obviously Bugs Bunny, Daffy Duck and the other cartoon characters create the fun. Featuring a great soundtrack of songs, including the title song by Quad City DJ's, ""Pump Up the Jam"" by Technotronic, ""Fly Like an Eagle"" by Seal, ""For You I Will"" by Monica, and of course the Grammy winning ""I Believe I Can Fly"" by R. Kelly. It may be cheesy a lot of the time, but you cannot help but go along with it, it is good nostalgia if you like the classic cartoons, the mix of live action and animation works well, and it is something that both children and adults will enjoy, a fun part-animated fantasy sports comedy. Pepe Le Pew was number 73, Foghorn Leghorn was number 61, Road Runner was number 48, The Sylvester and Tweety Show was number 35, Daffy Duck was number 30, Looney Tunes/Merrie Melodies was number 20, and Bugs Bunny was number 10 on The 100 Greatest Cartoons. Good!",Space Jam
8,ccthemovieman-1,The Good & Bad Of 'Space Jam',8,25 May 2007,"GOOD - Simply an enjoyable movie; lots of fun to watch and highlighted by a humorous Basketball game. Also, the surround sound is very good, the colors are beautiful, the cartoon effects well done and funny. Some of the humor is laugh-out-loud variety. As with a many good animated movies, there is so much to see and hear it would take many viewings to catch all the gags. With each viewing, you'll laugh at things you never noticed before. As far as ""live"" actors working with cartoon figures, this was much better done than the earlier ""Who Framed Roger Rabbit,"" so progress has been made in that area. While there is a lot going on, there are enough lulls to give viewers periodic breaks. The basketball action is fun to watch and I was surprised how well real-life stars Larry Bird and Michael Jordan acted.BAD - The story gets a little too juvenile in spots. The PC-minded female character (rabbit) is overly feminist, to the point of irritation and the occult gets far too much credibility in this story. Also, there are a few sexual innuendos in here that adults would catch but, hopefully, not little kids.OVERALL, a movie that appeals to adults and kids. Basketball fans will really enjoy it.",Space Jam
9,dbdumonteil,This movie merely aims at children,3,13 June 2003,"Making a movie that mixes characters cartoons with actors in the flesh is a good idea so long as the plot must be interesting enough to sustain the interest. For ""Space jam"", we're far from the result. With the exception of quite successful special effects and a plain performance of Michael Jordan, the movie is absolutely devoid of interest. It consists on a flat and trite story, a convenient and predictable screenplay. Moreover, Bugs Bunny and his friends are the kings of third-rate acting and make hardly the spectator laugh. In short, there is nearly nothing to save in this movie that will especially please to children.",Space Jam
10,michaelRokeefe,"Bugs Bunny, Daffy Duck and...Michael Jordan?",5,22 April 2011,"Can you just imagine the cost of this live-action animated comedy? Basketball legend Michael Jordan is forced to play basketball on a team of Looney Tune characters featuring Bugs, Daffy, Porky and Sylvester. The cartoon stars are to play a basketball game against some evil outer space creatures in order to not become slaves for an intergalactic amusement park owner. Its hopeful that Michael will be able to help save the day and maybe just bring along some of his buddies like Charles Barkley, Patrick Ewing and Larry Bird. Also in the cast: Bill Murray, Theresa Randle and Wayne Knight. I found it funny when Daffy Duck makes a disparaging remark using the name of Mickey Mouse. Show the small fry how to load, play and repeat.",Space Jam
11,sunwarrior13,Great Combo Of Basketball And Animation,7,29 March 2013,"Space Jam is a family live-action and animated sports comedy film that features Michael Jordan and the Looney Tunes characters.In the movie, Jordan must help the Looney Tunes gang with a basketball game against a group of outer space creatures whose plan, if they win, is to kidnap the Looney Tunes and take them to a failing intergalactic amusement park as the latest attraction.Also starring Academy Award-nominee Bill Murray and Wayne Knight. It was directed by Joe Pytka with Tony Cervone and Bruce W. Smith directing the animation. After Jordan announces his retirement from the game, he follows in his father's footsteps and turns to a career in baseball. Meanwhile, a group of criminal aliens called 'The Nerdlucks', led by their boss Mister Swackhammer plot to capture the Looney Tunes characters, who really exist in a secret animated world called Tune Land, and make them their newest attractions at Moron Mountain, a failing amusement park. Swackhammer believes enslaving the Tunes in this way will bring in more customers and save Moron Mountain from foreclosure. They arrive in Tune Land, and, seeing how short the aliens are, the Tunes, aided by a new arrival named Lola Bunny, bargain for their freedom by challenging the Nerdlucks to a basketball game. Preparing to cheat in the game, the Nerdlucks return to Earth and steal the Talent of Patrick Ewing, Larry Johnson, Charles Barkley, Muggsy Bogues, and Shawn Bradley, who are rendered incapable of playing basketball as a result. The Nerdlucks use the stolen Talent to transform into gigantic creatures that the Looney Tunes are unable to defeat, re-naming themselves the Monstars in the process. To help them win, the Tunes choose and recruit Michael, and he reluctantly agrees after the Monstars squash him into the shape of a basketball and bounce him around like one. At the game's climax, The TuneSquad are down by one, and it is up to Michael to score the winning point. Extending his arm to superhuman lengths with the power of toon physics, Michael makes the basket and wins the game. He helps the Monstars realize that they're bigger than Mister Swackhammer, who confronts them for losing. Fed up with their abusive boss, the Monstars tie him up and send him to the moon. At Michael's request, they return the stolen Talent to the other players by transferring them to a basketball. This reverts the Monstars back to the tiny Nerdlucks. Refusing to return to Moron Mountain to endure humiliation from their former boss, the Nerdlucks decide to stay with the Looney Tunes, who only agree if the Nerdlucks can prove themselves to be 'Looney', which they arguably complete on the spot. Afterwards, Michael returns to Earth in the Nerdlucks' spaceship, where he makes a dramatic appearance at a baseball game to the cheers of the audience, despite being late. The next day, Michael gives the stolen Talent back to the NBA players, who immediately regain their lost skills. He is later prompted by his rivals to return to the NBA, mirroring his real-life comeback in 1996.Simpler and cruder in terms of story and technique, this is still a great deal of fun, confirming that Jordan is every bit as mythological a creature as Daffy Duck or Yosemite Sam. Cute, rambunctious, generally amusing rather than outright funny, this clever mix of live action, highlighted by the unequaled skills of basketball superstar Michael Jordan, and animated Looney Tunes antics is a must-see for adults, kids, teenagers, women, men, boys, girls, old folks, young folks, Jordan fans, Bill Murray fans, Wayne Knight fans and every Looney Tunes lover who wants to revel in Bugs Bunny and his pals at their looney tuniest. A great combination of basketball and animation.",Space Jam
12,studioAT,Michael Jordan in a jam,6,22 October 2011,"Space Jam has become sort of a cult film for kids now and many of them probably only know Michael Jordan from this film and not for all his real life achievements as a sports star.It's not as funny as I remember it being as a kid, but it's certainly enjoyable enough fare, with some nice moments.The basketball game does go on a bit too long though, and the ending feels a bit rushed because of this.It is a film though that has taken on a bit of a cult status, and it will be interesting to see how the recently released sequel shapes up in comparison.",Space Jam

14,Theo Robertson,I Was Entertained,6,26 February 2005,"I notice a lot of people have very few kind words to say about SPACE JAM . I must admit that being a Scot I have little interest in basketball and know very little of the career of Michael Jordan ( Who's Michael Jordan ? ) but I still found this movie to be fair entertainment . I guess a lot of people dislike this movie because Mr Jordan played for such and such a basketball team A bunch of evil aliens invade Looney Tunes World and cast the cartoon characters into slavery and it's left to a sports legend to save them ! Come on guys , plots don't come anymore original than that so what's there to dislike ? We also have a subplot of the aliens interfering with other basketball players which did cause some amusement to this audience member . Also very enjoyable were the number of cameos that crept up through the movie , most notably Bill Murray Okay I wouldn't say SPACE JAM is as great as WHO FRAMED ROGER RABBIT but it's still an entertaining family movie regardless of how you feel about sport . With this in mind I'm totally puzzled why my local ITV station decided to broadcast it at 1.10 am !",Space Jam
15,preppy-3,Silly but hard to dislike,7,2 April 2008,"Movie about Michael Jordan and the Looney Tunes characters (Bugs Bunny, Daffy Duck, Roadrunner etc etc). An evil animated monster runs Moron Mountain--a planet with an amusement park. They need a new ride so he sends five helpers to Earth to kidnap the Looney Tunes characters. Then they can be used as a new act at the amusement park. Bugs and the others agree--IF they play them in a basketball game and win. Bugs and the others convince Michael Jordan to help them--but the aliens have evil plans up their sleeve.Michael Jordan meets the Looney Tunes. Sounds like a sure recipe for disaster. I was positive this film was going to be a bomb when it was released (with HEAVY publicity) in 1996. Yes--it's silly but if you love Looney Tunes (like I do) you'll probably love this. The characters are treated (more or less) respectfully and during the climatic basketball game the stands are full of every Warner Bros. cartoon character ever made. One small mouse character who talks nonstop I remembered from childhood and I literally broke up laughing when he appeared! The animation is just great, the merging of live action with cartoon figures works and the script is fun. There are groaners and stupid lines but, all in all, it was pretty amusing.The debits: Michael Jordan just can't act. I'm sure he was a wonderful basketball player but his acting was as wooden as a basketball court. Also various other sports figures pop up and prove they're worse actors than Jordan! Bill Murray (who can be good) is just lousy in a supporting role. And Wayne Knight is just SO annoying. Also I could have lived without seeing the Warner Bros. logo popping up everywhere. At one point it's on Daffy Duck's butt...and he kisses it! And there's a brief take-off on ""Pulp Fiction"" which isn't as funny now as it was in 1996. So, these things lessen the movie but don't destroy it. Worth catching if you're a Warner Bros. animation fan. Kids will love it. I give it a 7.",Space Jam
16,utgard14,Stupid But Entertaining,5,17 May 2014,"Michael Jordan and assorted Looney Tunes cartoon characters play against aliens in a game of basketball. Adapted from an unpublished Shakespeare play, I believe. Surprisingly, Jordan's acting is pretty good. It's all the more impressive considering he's acting opposite nothing but green screen most of the time. Bill Murray is great in his small part but that's no surprise. As for the Looney Tunes characters: as with most modern versions of them, they are pretty lame. They lack the edge and humor of the classics. Not to mention the voices are weak. The addition of a new politically correct character, Lola Bunny, is insulting on several levels. Cynicism and nitpicks aside, it's an innocuous and enjoyable little bit of fluff. A couple of nice songs, too.",Space Jam

18,TBJCSKCNRRQTreviews,Just not very good,6,25 October 2007,"I am not a fan of basketball, Michael Jordan or the Looney Tunes. Why, then, do I own a store-bought VHS copy of this film, you ask? Darned if I know. Maybe it was a present. Maybe it was from a time where my taste was less discriminating... but hey, even kids must have some limit, some point at which they stare in disbelief at the crap thrown at them. The film opens to a scene which has a soundtrack song the choice of which is so painfully obvious, that actually choosing it is almost ridiculous, goes on with such highlights as a number of the Looneys all spitting in unison, and ends in a major showdown, with occasional awful acting by basketball players, and one rather underdeveloped, faint attempt at an emotion-evoking subplot along the way. The strange thing is that, save for said showdown, there's really hardly any basket played in the film... one would think that to be one of the main attractions. Their lead is one of the good players of the sport, and the plot can't be summed up or described without mentioning said free-time activity. Scenes that seem like they'd lead to at least *some* basketball... just exactly don't. Dan Castellaneta shows up in a cameo, doing nothing. The plot is OK. The pacing isn't too bad. The humor isn't all good, but it has its moments. The large cast of characters, some of which are animated, allows fairly little time for almost all of them, but I suppose people aren't used to spending too much time with the Tunes, so that may not be a bad thing. Oddly enough, they really hardly do any of their trademark gags. The film doesn't overstay its welcome, coming in at not much under an hour and a half. This is the introduction of Lola Bunny, who, I gather from the Trivia entry regarding this, stayed with the franchise. Bugs is this time, and some from this point on, performed by Billy West, also known from Futurama. If you listen carefully, you can tell the ""Fry"" in some of Bunny's lines. The direction is done by Joe Pytka, who, before this, had done a few Michael Jackson videos and a Richard Dreyfuss comedy. The blend of animation and live action isn't always smooth. The effects look dated today, in particular the CGI, but the general animation isn't bad. The film does have some reasonable moments... the initial arrival of the aliens to the land of cartoons, for example. The music is good enough. I guess it's a decent enough film for those who are fans of the sport and/or the cartoons. Just strange how much there is to be found in the film that features neither. I recommend this to anyone who finds themselves in either or both of the aforementioned groups, as well as anyone still interested after reading this review. 6/10",Space Jam
19,anaconda-40658,Jam This Film in Space in a Trash Can.,2,14 January 2016,"Space Jam (1996): Dir: Joe Pytka / Cast: Michael Jordan, Theresa Randle, Wayne Knight, Bill Murray, Larry Bird: Space Jam sounds like something I did while parallel parking. It opens with a young Michael Jordan impressing his father with basketball. Too bad the screenwriter couldn't impress us with a screenplay worthy of the talent involved. Meanwhile the Looney Tunes may becomes slaves to a theme park unless they can win a basketball game. The opposing team travel to Earth to suck the talent out of the N.B.A stars save for Jordan who is persuaded to help. Ridiculous storytelling without any of the intelligence of Who Framed Roger Rabbit? Animated characters look dashing with Bugs Bunny, Daffy Duck, Wile E. Coyote, Roadrunner, and a rather suggestive appearance by Lola Bunny. Her innuendo is perhaps a tad more suggestive than the film's intended audience deserves. The film is an excuse to cash in on the popularity of Jordan who actually holds his own opposite the cartoon and will need to think beyond human means to solve the plot. Other roles are merely cardboard with Wayne Knight, Theresa Randle and Bill Murray. Directed by Joe Pytka who highlights the star and the animated characters but hiring people to put an effort into plot would have been nice. The result is a very dull game that should be jammed in the space between a tire and the pavement. Score: 2 ½ / 10",Space Jam
20,Aaron1375,This one plays more like a Muppets movie.,3,17 September 2003,"This movie was really bad.  The only saving graces are Bill Murray and Larry Bird's all to brief appearances.  We have definitely found something Jordan can't do and that is act.  That is kind of bad considering he is playing himself in this one.  Though most of his costars weren't there, so it might have been difficult.  At least he stopped after this one unlike Shaq who made four or five pictures...Thank God Phil Jackson came along and refocused him.  As for the plot being like a Muppets movie it is.  A few appearances here and there from a surprise celebrity, the whole working with live actors.  It just did not seem to be a Looney tunes movie.  Though they stopped being Looney a long time ago.  I liked Daffy Duck when he was, well, daffy...he has been smart aleck duck for a while now.  It just doesn't feel right.  All the Looney Tunes on one team, some being life long enemies...and what is the point of introducing the bad guy voiced by I think Danny DeVito. The Martian has always been trying to take over the world, why not just let it be him.  Also, what is up with the girl bunny?  Why introduce a new character?  I guess we just had to be politically correct.  Well this one may be good for the kiddies, but most of us are going to recognize it for what it is...one long commercial.  I saw a clip from the next Looney Tunes movie and it is even more Muppet looking than this one",Space Jam
21,StevePulaski,Authentic fun on everyone's behalf,8,7 February 2016,"NOTE: This film was recommended to me by Ryan Clevenger for ""Steve Pulaski Sees It."" Living in Illinois, Space Jam is a film that hits the tender spots of the last two generations; one generation that got to experience Michael Jordan's unfathomable legacy as arguably the greatest basketball player who ever lived, and the other, mine, that reflects on his legacy through highlights and documentaries to keep the memory of such an all-star alive. Jordan's legacy didn't stop at on-court talent, as he was one of the most marketed athletes of his time and helped popularize the NBA, let alone the Chicago Bulls, on a previously unforeseen international level.If we remove the nostalgia factor from Space Jam, which is a very difficult thing to do by the way, then the film serves as Jordan's versatility. After retiring from the NBA at a relatively young age to pursue a career in baseball, Jordan only became more of a fascinating person, in addition to someone with impeccable charisma. Space Jam exists as a response to Jordan's departure from the NBA to the MLB, as the Looney Tune gang of Bugs Bunny, Daffy Duck, Tweety Bird, Sylvester the Cat, Porky Pig, and Lola Bunny all call Jordan out of retirement when they challenge a group of intergalactic invaders from ""Moron Mountain"" to a basketball game in exchange for the planet.The Looney Tunes thing this will be an easy win, until the aliens from Moron Mountain, who are relatively puny in size and strength, find a way to steal the talents of star basketball players like Charles Barkley and Larry Johnson and become the ""Monstars"" of the court. Meanwhile, Jordan agrees to play for the Looney Tunes team, but it takes all of the five minutes of practice to show that the team is disproportionately talented towards Jordan. As a result, the team indulges in some aggressive training tactics to beat the Monstars and save the planet.As an amalgamation of live-action and animation, especially in an age where Pixar was coming on the scene and traditional animation was soon to be phased out, Space Jam is bright and vivid. The real-life characters of Michael Jordan, Wayne Knight, who has an amusing role, like he always does, Larry Bird, and even Bill Murray's interactions with the animated characters of Bugs Bunny and the like in a convincing, believable manner. The result is a beautifully colored and nicely executed mix of whimsy.Because both worlds of reality and animation are explored here, Space Jam has the luxury of being a film that can go beyond traditional boundaries of a sports film, and the Looney Tunes are no better characters to incite such zaniness. The animated bunch are quick-witted and ecstatic, and Jordan is clearly doing this for fun and excitement rather than a phoned-in project or another endorsement. Had Space Jam been more of a lackluster cash-in, sports fans and Jordan fans would've seen it from a mile away and dismissed the film immediately. However, because everyone involved recognizes what a zany project this is, they don't try to fight the lunacy, but instead, play along, and that provides us, the audience, with a wickedly entertaining stride into a lively sports film that is so fun you almost, almost miss the clichéd underdog element.Starring: Michael Jordan, Wayne Knight, Bill Murray, and Larry Bird.

22,Smells_Like_Cheese,Pretty pathetic,3,20 November 2006,"I was kinda looking forward to seeing Space Jam, ever have since I was a kid, but for some reason I never got the opportunity to see it. Well, my friend owned the movie and lent it to me, I love Looney Toons, they're just so cool and funny and I remember being a huge fan of the Chicago Bulls, so I was very excited to see this film. There is one thing I forgot, this is not 1996, the height of popularity for Michael and The Bulls and this movie seemed like a cheap publicity stunt.Michael is playing himself from the time where his father had died in that car accident and decided to join a baseball team, despite the fact that it's not the Sox represented in the film, which is the team he really played for. But the toons are invaded by aliens who want them for their amusement park in space. They challenge them to a basketball game, of course the toons suck, so they ask for Michael's help.Over all, Space Jam is just a cheap thrill for some, but for me it really wasn't all that. I was really disappointed and not to mention, keep Michael away from the big screen, because I hate to spill the beans, he's not that good of an actor. It's a pretty bad film, even if it is for kids.3/10",Space Jam
23,Rainey-Dawn,It's An OK Film,6,23 October 2014,"Space Jam is actually a fairly good older comedy film. It's got the Loony Tunes characters in it and that is the best part of the movie - just watching the Loony Tunes in a new way. I have no problem with Michael Jordon either - I realize he is outstanding athlete and was extremely popular at the time this film.The downside, for me, is that I'm not a fan of Basketball. I know it's a very popular sport that many people enjoy it and I will never knock it - it's just not something I am into.Space Jam is worth watching if you like comedies, Loony Tunes and Basketball. If you like Space Jam then you might like similar types of movies: ""Who Framed Roger Rabbit"" and ""Song of the South"".6/10",Space Jam
24,ElMaruecan82,Space Gem...,7,23 January 2020,"To put it simply, ""Space Jam"" is the twice successful revival of Michael Jordan and Bugs Bunny's career.At 33, Jordan was past his prime and his controversial retirement following the death of his father, for a baseball reconversion, prompted Warner Bros studios to find a new vehicle to a necessary come-back. Meanwhile, the Looney Tunes were a milestone of TV and pop culture, but in the 90s, Bart and Homer Simpson had stolen a big chunk of their thunder, they had to deal with 3D competition, not to mention the eternal rivalry with Disney. Warner Bros studios never had their Renaissance and they never really mastered the world of animated feature to begin with.It's interesting that we're comparing one real character, who was perhaps the greatest and most iconic Michael of the 90s, after Jackson, and animated characters, but who would reduce Bugs Bunny to ink and paint? (And Daffy too) The legendary stinker and wisecracker (who was drawn that way) was the animated embodiment of Groucho Marx with a cooler look, perhaps the animated hero with the most personality before Bart. As a matter of fact, he's so good that if the film had been about Bugs visiting the human world, it would have worked as well. But then we wouldn't have Porky, Daffy, Tweety and all the gang and that would have been a shame because say what you want about Disney, zaniness isn't its strongest suit.And when you see how animation can ruin even the best animated characters, take the ""Tom and Jerry"" movies for instances, one should applaud the way the film respects the spirit of these old cartoons whose ""Merrie Melodies"" theme have been one of the most instantly identifiable music for all generations, a real hymn to the Golden Age of animation and beyond. Even as a kid who grew up with MGM and Disney, I found an odd little charm in the Looney Tunes and if I preferred Donald over Daffy, between Mickey and Bugs, there was no contest. Remember when the two titan rodents met in ""Who Framed Roger Rabbit"", equal screen time but who got the best line? Bugs!""Space Jam"" is no ""Who Framed Roger Rabbit"" however, but not every animation and live action crossover film has this pretension. Directed officially by Joe Pytka (Ivan Reitman is credited as producer), ""Space Jam"" is pretty straightforward in its marketing and since it decided to have a basketball player for the main role, it's obvious it didn't mean to sweep acting awards. But if Jordan is an amateur, his work is far beyond amateurish and the way he plays himself in a role that floats between two universes is remarkable. Working in a green screen and pretending to have interactions with some of the most beloved characters is a feat and his choice to play it straightforward as if he was mildly surprised is the right one, acting surprised might have put him in the way of his ""character"" and be a total distraction.Once Michael gets in Looney Tunes' land, he faces the deal and learns he must coach the Toons to win a game against the Monstars, previously known as the (far less intimidating) Nerdlocks, small creatures who took their height and talent from other basketball icons: Patrick Ewing, Shawn Bradley, Charles Parker and Muggsy Bogues. So, there's not just Jordan's freedom at stakes but the career of four players and the whole future of the NBA jeopardized by an animated crook named Swackhammer and voiced by Danny De Vito. The plot is spiced up by two other characters who'd have nothing to do: Wayne Knight as an obsessed (almost enamored) publicist and Bill Murray playing himself as a guy who wants to have a shot at the game. That these characters end up serving purpose is a joke, but there's nothing better than a comedy that doesn't take itself seriously, it's all a matter of pay-offs.And that's the spirit of the cartoon. The animation looks like something borrowed from an ad for Sprite of Nike but the film has no pretension either to hide its marketing value, there's even a scene where Daffy reminds that they are property of Warner Bros and a few other comments involving copyrights and ""take that"" nods to Disney. The film makes money through sponsors with the same wit than ""Wayne's World"" product placement but that's because everything is a product placement when you have characters not with names but brand names. But Jordan brings life to what could have been a dull and average performance and instead of showing off as the player with skills, he only becomes the guy who has fun playing with toons, avenges Tweety, act like a coach or a toon. Anyway, he's having fun and so are we.The film has an enthusiasm that is communicative and catching and reminds of these times when everything was simpler even in its corniness, Jordan may not be the best actor but he's a presence as valuable as the other giant and he doesn't even try to overdo it, and it works, everyone plays his part perfectly and that goes for Bill Murray too. There's no message, no patronizing statement, though the human story carries a few drama elements and one can't ignore how magic and transporting ""I Believe I Can Fly"" works. Another 90s gem at a time where R. Kelly was still popular.Still, even if the film grossed a quarter billion dollar, it didn't have the same lasting success like a Disney blockbuster or its obvious counterpart ""Who Framed Roger Rabbit"", maybe that's the limit of the marketed silliness, at the end, it lacks the universal touch, the timeless value, the fairy dust. Even the character of Lola Bunny was an interesting addition but a Jessica Rabbit she wasn't. It's certainly a pure product of the 90s, an era I'll forever cherish, my teen years, but it's a product nonetheless.That's all, folks!",Space Jam

26,Pjtaylor-96-138044,Bit of a stretch.,6,25 February 2021,"'Space Jam (1996)' follows Michael Jordan as he's recruited by the Looney Tunes to help them win their freedom, via a basketball match, from their would-be enslavers, a group of similarly 2D extra-terrestrials who are enhanced with the basketball skills of various other NBA players. Oh, and Bill Murray is involved, too. Needless to say, it's a really weird concept for a movie. It's both a sports drama and a family comedy, a well-done live-action/2D animation hybrid with potentially contrasting target audiences. Though it's a bit slow to get going, it eventually picks itself up and becomes a rather enjoyable time. It works best when Jordan is firmly in the land of the Looney Tunes, though some elements involving other starring-as-themselves basketball players also provide a couple of chuckles. It's silly, but that's the point. It's also relatively accomplished from a technical standpoint, with most of its visual effects holding up remarkably well - although some of its full CG body doubles are a little disconcerting and the 'soft' look of the cartoon characters takes a little getting used to. It's a goofy, easy-to-watch experience with a fair bit of charm to it. It isn't great, but it's good enough. 6/10",Space Jam
27,Cineanalyst,Brand Synergy,3,8 July 2021,"With its sequel upcoming and the who's-left-standing-after-injuries of an NBA Finals getting under way, it seemed as good a time as any to rewatch ""Space Jam."" Michael Jordan was a great basketball player, obviously, but more than that he was a great brand--and still is as sneaker sales and ""The Last Dance"" (2020) miniseries attest. After all, Air Jordan is reported to have earned ""only"" a little over $90 million over his career throwing a ball through a hoop, while making near $2 billion and counting from corporate sponsors of the likes of Nike, Gatorade, Hanes, McDonald's, Warner Bros., etc. Actor he is not, though, as evidenced by his lack of personality here even as he plays a version of himself, including glossing over the more sympathetic aspects of his biography such as his father's death that led to his first NBA retirement and stint in baseball minor leagues.Instead, what we get here is more branding. Aliens from a slave-based amusement park planet called ""Moron Mountain"" or the ""NCAA"" or something invade the domain of Warner Bros. Looney Tunes--where Daffy Duck's posterior is even tattooed with the media conglomerate's logo. Convincing the aliens that they must wager such an enslavement over a game of hoops, however, Bugs Bunny and gang enlist the help of another brand, Jordan, to preserve their capitalist empire. Jordan agrees as long as he can advertise his shoes, as well. Newman and ""Dan Aykroyd"" are brought along for alleged comic relief from the other failed jokes, which even include Bugs and Daffy complaining about their lack of compensation for merchandise bearing their likeness, among everything else being thrown at the wall from pretending Jordan drinks steroids to randomly referencing that favorite family film, ""Pulp Fiction"" (1994).Whoever wins the game is irrelevant, as the all mighty dollar is the true victor. Otherwise, the only thing here of slight interest methinks is the NBA being postponed in the movie due to players appearing to be infected by mysterious germs--in fact, the aliens removing their talents from their bodies for their own use in the big game. Aside from the comedic exaggeration of gas masks and wrapping an entire stadium in plastic, rather prescient of what happened to the league, as well as the rest of the world, this past pandemic year. In the end, though, money won again despite players' training and rest patterns being disrupted and their off-season shortened--hence this injury-plagued season.... Bring on the NBA Finals and Space Jam 2, I guess.",Space Jam
28,lesleyharris30,"Simple Looney Tunes Fun,",8,12 July 2010,"Space Jam is a great movie with a well written plot, a great cast and immensely talented voice cast. This movie is certainly nothing fantastic, the story is far fetched even for Looney Tunes standards and it does not deliver any memorable lines like we've seen in many of their well known cartoons. However, I have seen this many times and still love it to this day, it was a big movie from my childhood and it is certainly great nostalgia. The movie does hold up pretty well as a great family film, obviously people of all ages love the Looney Tunes, I find it impossible to not feel joy when Bugs Bunny or Daffy Duck are onscreen, and watching them play basketball with the surprisingly good actor and professional basketball player Michael Jordan, who has a great presence on screen, against a group of aliens is fun and enjoyable from start to finish. Comedic actors such Bill Murray and Wayne Knight are more fun for adults and provide some great one liners. Watch it with the whole family and just forget about real life for 90 minutes, the whole house will get a great kick out of Space Jam. Michael Jordan plays a basketball game with Bugs Bunny and the rest of the Looney Tunes against a group of aliens that are looking to keep them as slaves for their theme park.

29,Irishchatter,"Brilliant as usual, even as an adult now!",10,30 April 2016,"I remember watching this when I was a kid and thinking this was the best Looney Tunes film back in the day. I don't remember what year I've first seen this. I've watched this a couple of times anyway and today in 2016, I got to watch after so many years. It does bring back such good memories during my childhood. I honestly still enjoyed it, you might think you have grown out of Looney Tunes. S'cuse me? They are still legends that we know of today man! I love Bugs Bunny with his sarcastic sexy voice and Daffy Duck with his 'thinks he knows everything' attitude. C'mon who wouldn't enjoy them like they are hilarious like the other Looney Tunes characters we have known from childhood!I even loved Lola Bunny, she is such a babe. Definitely herself and Bugs are adorable together. Best of all, Kath Soucie voiced her. She is like known for her role as Dexters mum in ""Dexters Laboratory"" and Princess Sally in ""Sonic the hedgehog "" series. I was really chuffed because she is my favorite voice actress out there so I decided to watch her again by replaying the movie today!All I can say about this film is, it's still one of the best movies out there. Especially if you had Looney Tunes in your childhood or not!",Space Jam
30,CuriosityKilledShawn,Big Macs for life,3,29 May 2004,"How any critic can call Looney Tunes: Back in Action an exercise in franchise promotion but not puke at the 80-minute commercial that is Space Jam is beyond me.Our plot has Danny Devito play the voice of an evil, monster type businessman who's theme park is failing. In desperation he sends 5 little creatures to capture the Looney Tunes and bring them back as the new attraction.So...where is Looney Tune land? Apparently it's underground. And digging up any golf ball hole will eventually lead to it. When the Looney Tunes challenge the would-be kidnappers to a basketball game they kidnap Michael Jordan to be on their team.The quality of the film nosedives from here on. Jordan's acting is so wooden it's mahogany. He expresses no confusion, joy or surprise at being yanked into Looney Tune land and confronted by all the toons. 'Bugs Bunny you're a cartoon you're not real', he says in the most flat, boring and dullest way (missing commas intended as he doesn't use them).And then the big game follows. Once it's over, and there's no reason left to continue watching, the film goes on for another 10 minutes (to beef the running time up 'feature length') with the basketball/Jordan story. It's rubbish.It's no surprise that the film is directed by Joe Pytka (he's NOT Joe Dante that's for sure), a man who has never done any other features but over a 1000 TV ads, or something. Space Jam is nowt but 100% proof Warner whored out their most famous creation to make a few quick, and cheap, bucks. It's heartbreaking, heinous stuff.Casting Michael Jordan alongside the Looney Tunes is not inspired and imaginative. It's crass and desperate. Now they can attract sports fans AND kiddies. And Michael Jordan of all people! He's not a good actor and his fame outside of the U.S. is minimal to say the least. Moreso today.The only part of the film that comes (very, very remotely) close to the true spirit of the Looney Tunes is the score. James Newton Howard (a truly bizarre choice, how about Jerry Goldsmith, Bruce Broughton or even Danny Elfman) recognizes the classic Looney Tunes themes and uses them appropriately in certain moments but the rest of the score is generic and uninspired.Back in Action was intelligent, witty and satirical. Space Jam is corny, cheap and classless. It's an absolute travesty. How can we honestly take seriously a movie that has every cast member awe at Michael Jordan, has not too subtle product placement for McDonalds and has the Looney Tunes (one of the most ingenious creations in history) exploited in the most shameless and guilt free manner. With Space Jam, Warner showed that they'd cash in the Looney Tunes at a pawn shop for $5 if they could. A total lack of respect for Chuck Jones, Friz Freleng and Robert McKimson.And they don't even act Looney. The only laughs come from Bugs and Daffy. And it's sporadic and inconsistent. Producer Ivan Reitman (who has no experience and no business with this franchise) managed to convince Bill Murray to appear in this drek (for about 10 minutes) so the trailer could boast an ACTUAL star other than Jordan. Murray's performance is the bare minimum and has a let's-get-this-over-with feel (though Murray working below-par is still miles ahead of many other actors at the top of their game). His appearance in the film is massively oversold.It's just not fair that THIS is a big hit while Back In Action flopped horribly. I consider it the biggest miscarriage in justice ever. I still blame the marketing for Back in Action. It was bad, REAL bad. But still has some sort of quiet dignity about it when compared to the McDonalds promoted, in your face junk that was Space Jam's marketing. Is it any wonder Joe Dante had Back In Action nicknamed 'The Anti-Space Jam movie'?And just what the hell is a Space Jam anyway? It's not even set in Space!!!It took Warner 3 tries but the finally released the movie in its original aspect ratio. The DVD presents the film is 1.78:1 anamorphic widescreen with pretty active Dolby 5.1 sound. There are loads of features but they are all fluff. Some 80's Looney Tunes shorts are included too.",Space Jam
31,Bored_Dragon,Looney Tunes can't disappoint,8,24 March 2018,"I leading roles - Michael Jordan and Bugs Bunny! How could anyone resist this announcement... In 1996, this movie was a miracle that, even without the internet, caused big hype. I loved it as a kid, and now, two decades later, I didn't enjoy any less.An amusement park, somewhere far away in space, begins to decline in attendance and the owner has to provide new attractions to stay in business. He decides to go to Earth and kidnap Warner's cartoon characters. The fate of the Looney Tunes will be decided by a basketball game against aliens, and desperate toons are calling for help from Michael Jordan.Story is classic Looney Tunes cartoon combined with feature film. Beside probably every Warner animated character and Michael Jordan, there are few more NBA players and genius comedians Wayne Knight and Bill Murray. From today's perspective, the film is technically rather outdated, but even if you are not able to look at it from the perspective of the time in which it originated, its speed, humor and a lot of interesting details and references (which you have no chance to catch all during a single viewing) leave you no time to bother with technical shortcomings. I also particularly liked the music (Seal, R. Kelly, Salt-N-Pepa, Technotronic, 2 Unlimited), which objectively might not be that great, but in me, who grew up in nineties, it woke up some nostalgia and its specific atmosphere put me in the right mood to enjoy this wacky film.8/10",Space Jam
32,ironhorse_iv,"Yes, I know this movie has some bugs, but it's still my Jam! It's a guilty pleasure of mine!",6,21 May 2017,"There's been a lot of variations of the classic Looney Tunes characters over the years, but the 1990s reincarnation has caused the most controversy, due to its bloated use of commercialism marketing. There is no bigger example of that, than 1996's 'Space Jam' directed by Joe Pytka; a giant glorified marketing ploy to sell Looney Tunes toys and Air Jordans. It was no surprise that the feature-length movie was like that, seeing how a series of Nike commercials starring Michael Jordan and Bugs Bunny in the early 1990s, was the source that spark the idea for this movie. Despite that, I still kinda like this movie. I didn't mind the commercialism style as much as others, maybe, because this obviously produce placement film did had somewhat of interesting story. Don't get me wrong, on the surface level, Michael Jordan teaming up with the Looney Tunes to face cartoony aliens in a basketball game, in order to save them from slavery in an intergalactic amusement park is indeed ridiculous & somewhat stupid. However, there seem to be, some thought provoking, undercurrents themes, running through this fictional film that could had been great. Let's start with father & son dramatics that the beginning of the film established! It was very heartfelt. Unfortunately, the movie doesn't do anything with that, as the relationship with his father is never brought up, again. I think the movie could be better, if the film explore their relationship more, because we know from real life, that Jordan retired from the NBA to pursue the dream of his late father who was murdered in 1993, who had always envisioned his son as a baseball player. Sadly, the film doesn't give that exposition, making the baseball subplot, more out of the blue. Just think if they did, there would be a great conflict for his character, as Jordan tries to honor his late father's wishes, despite, not being any good in the sport, while also trying to fight the urge to play basketball, again, so that he can make a living for his family due to financial problems. I guess, mentioning Jordan father's death was too dark for this 1990s kid movie, but just think, if this film had a little more 'balls'. It would give this film, a little more stakes. Also, I wish, the movie gave a better reason, why Jordan was helping the Tunes, besides the villains bullying the tunes and him. Honestly, the movie could had intermixed, Jordan's children, a lot better with the Looney Tunes basketball plot, by having them, be abducted by the aliens and taken to Moron Mountain after Bugs seek his help. It would add some really needed stakes. Yes, I know, the kidnapped plot would be clichés, but it's better than the pointless scene, that we got of them, helping Bugs Bunny (Voiced by Billy West) & Daffy Duck (Voiced by Dee Bradley Baker), search for basketball shorts. All of these ideas, would help make Jordan, feel less drywall than he is, in this movie. Without it, Jordan's bad acting is more noticeable, due to his limitedly. I would rather see him, attempt being dramatic, than seeing him, such a square in this film. Despite that, I have to say, the animation department at Warner Bros did a great job, making it seem like Jordan was really interacting with the Looney Tunes. In the field of animation, the film is almost in par, with 1988's 'Who Framed Roger Rabbit'. Still, I wish the humor in this film could be, a little bit better. Don't get me wrong, the movie does have some funny moments, but there's some off-color humor, that didn't need to be there. Also, some of the slapstick jokes, during the game were a little too childish for Looney Tunes. In the end, I just wish, the movie could had play more on the satire part of the cartoon series, more. One miss opportunity was making fun of the concept of Moron Mountain. It would had been entertaining to see the Looney Tunes poke fun at the idea of selling their souls out for an amusement park. It could had a Six Flags/Marriot Park vibe to it. Regardless of the lack of satire humor, Looney Tunes characters were amusing. However, I wish the filmmaker gave new character, Lola Bunny (Voiced by Kath Soucie), a little more personality, than being a token objectified hot rabbit. She seem a bit one-dimensional. Anyways, I have to say, the voice acting for the tunes, is pretty damn accurate to the original voice actors. As for the live acting actors; Bill Murray's cameo was indeed a highlight. The deadpan, don't give an f*ck attitude to the animated madness going on around him provide some of the biggest laughs, toward the end. However, surprising, it was the other professional basketball players that takes the cake for best jokes. Seeing the players going through series of embarrassing moments was pretty hilarious. I can't say, the same with Wayne Knight as Stan Podolak, whom comes across, as too annoying for his own good. The numerous close shots with him, made me, want to turn off the movie. As for the number of NBA stock footage, quickly being flash during the credits. I didn't mind it, but I can understand, if somebody get really ill. That sequence was indeed, seizure epilepsy due to how photosensitive, it was. Still, that upbeat rap by Quad City DJ that came with it, was pretty awesome. The other songs in the soundtrack like 'I Believe I can Fly' by R. Kelly & ""Fly like An Eagle' By Seal was equally as extraordinary. I hope the rumor sequel with LeBron James has songs, just as memorable as the original. Overall: Even with its flaws, Space Jam, for better or for worse, is just so outrageous, you can't help, being drawn to it. I just can't help, loving it. It's just one of those movies.",Space Jam

The direction which was made by Joe Pytka was good and he succeed on presenting very well his main characters, the plot and also the back stories of the main characters. The interpretation of Michael Jordan who played as himself it was very good and he made the difference.

However, I think that sometimes this quirky little gem is overlooked in the pantheon of animated fare as it shares many of those same ""Toy Story"" traits.For a basic plot summary, ""Space Jam"" sees ""former"" (during his ""baseball years"") NBA great Michael Jordan (played by himself, of course!) join forces with Bugs Bunny, Daffy Duck, and all the other Looney Tunes gang to play a b-ball games against the evil minions of Swackhammer of Moron Mountain in Toon Land.The reason this film works so well is two-fold:First, it is just a great kid's movie. I mean, what kid doesn't like the Looney Tunes, right?! There are enough crazy antics to keep most kids entertained for the runtime.The true hallmark of the film, though, is how well it stands up to ""nostalgia viewers"" like myself, or those who saw it ""live"" back in 1996. ""Space Jam"" took full advantage of Michael Jordan's mystique (back when the NBA was relevant to everyone and still fighting the NFL for popularity), added some great music, and even capitalized on Jordan's retirement by making it a plot point.Simply put, ""Space Jam"" may be somewhat of a forgotten effort due to basketball's waning popularity, the time gone by after Jordan, and the fact that even the Looney Tunes themselves are no longer as popular as they once were. However, the cultural significance of this movie (for those who ""lived it"") cannot be ignored. When Jordan is flying around the court and ""I Believe I Can Fly"" is crooning in the background, this is pure magic for the nostalgic set.",Space Jam

This is not, of course, the first time we've seen live action and animation blend together like this; 1988's Who Framed Roger Rabbit is the film that immediately springs to mind, and throughout Space Jam it is tough to rid it from one's head once it's in there. The bad news is that Space Jam is a film which needs its cartoonified contingent in order to be at all interesting, whereas you're able to get so wrapped up in Who Framed Roger Rabbit that it's easy to forget you're even watching a live action cross-pollination. In short: you could remove the animated characters from Bob Zemeckis' minor masterpiece and still be caught up in a central character confronting his grief; alcoholism and prejudices as a twisting, adult narrative unfolds around him. Remove the 'toons from this similarly pitched 1996 effort, and you get the likes of Michael Jordan mugging his way through some awkward green-screen routines and a dull circular narrative about him rediscovering his love for the game of basketball.Ah, yes: Michael Jordan. There are certain personalities in certain sports you've just ""heard of"", regardless of the sport in question. At the time of the film's production, names synonymous with the likes of golf, tennis and football might very well have been Nicklaus; Sampras and Pele – in Jordan (of whom even I have heard, and I know nothing of the game of basketball) we have a mainstream figure dropped into the centre of a film arriving will all the baggage; hysteria and reputation that comes with him on top of that buzz of seeing cartoon characters that have been famous for as many as three times the number of years Jordan has even existed. Indeed, in case you were not already aware: Jordan is a superstar; a man whose achievements in basketball open the film in montage format. We observe the trophies he's won, the millions of adoring fans he's garnered and even the Olympic medals he's picked up.Jordan, however, is tired of basketball; a premise to this ""character's"" existence which might ordinarily be greeted with scoffing and furrowed brows as this stinking rich superstar slumps into an apparent pit of discontent at a life of being suffocated by those around him and adorned just a tad too much by his peers. That is, if we weren't already aware he did indeed grow weary of said lifestyle and thus moved briefly into baseball. Meanwhile, narrative and conflict arrives in the form of a slimy alien creature voiced by Danny de Vito; an alien who owns a theme park on a planet many moons away. He's in monetary trouble, and proposes to his equally bug-like accomplices that they travel to Planet Earth; warp their way, somehow, into our television sets (which apparently hold the key to entry into the programmes aided therein); kidnap an array of the Looney Tunes and bring them back so that they may act as a permanent feature to the theme park, thus reigniting business.So far, so Looney. The 'toons have an issue with being thrust from their home in order to be taken to somewhere else so that they may perform the same gags over and over again to an ogling audience.....wait-a-second, isn't that what they do anyway? In light of it all, they propose a basketball match with the gribblies: if they win, they stay here; if they lose, they'll pack up and come with them for eternal slavery. Thudding into the narrative hub lumbers Jordan, a basketball player the 'toons recruit equating to certain success, right? Not necessarily: the small, slug like aliens steal the ""talents"" of various then NBA professionals before growing themselves to a larger scale into order to win the bet.The film is mostly underdog fluff, but underdog fluff made a little more interesting than usual with the presence of people such as Yosemite Sam and Daffy Duck going up against these third party extra-terrestrials, furthermore aided by that basketball player you've probably heard of and that bloke out of Jurassic Park and Basic Instinct. The film's droll liberal agenda dominates proceedings more than any sort of interest in the result or anything else; this is ultimately a film about people and creatures from all walks of life coming together and working as a team, whereas the only ""winner"" (without giving anything away) is basketball (or more specifically: ""sports"") itself. The framework about Jordan playing for a cause as worthy as the one wherein he defends a group of little animals from hulking monsters, thus rediscovering his love for the game of basketball, is as meek and as plodding as it sounds whereas one scene wherein a character verbally runs through all the companies & products Jordan has previously endorsed is disturbingly ambiguous in regards to whether it's lampooning how much Jordan has sold out or is just guilt edged product placement. No matter, the film is a blast; the match itself is constructed with energy and verve, while the makers manage to slide in a new Warner Brother's Looney Tune altogether in the form of Lola Bunny - someone who's fresh and fun and doesn't discredit the old guard. Like most of these sorts of things, you'd need to be pretty sniffy to not enjoy it. I went with it, and enjoyed it.",Space Jam
40,digitalbeachbum,One Late Review,9,22 July 2021,"I was never a big basketball follower. I didn't even play well, not even playing HORSE. After twenty five years, this movie finally gets my review.Michael Jordan was iconic. He was a player who changed the NBA. Sure you had a lot of stars back then, and the Boston/Lakers battle was amazing. Jordan however took the entire league to another level.I recall some of the big games and they were big and talked about by everyone. The market, the advertising, was all Jordan. He was involved with everything, his face was everywhere. I even have that poster with him and Muhammad Ali for the car dealership.This movie was the cherry on top of a very large ice cream sundae. It had all the Looney Tunes. It had a good script. It had an all star supporting cast. It had an amazing, top selling soundtrack. It had comedy for both the kids and the adults.The script is balanced too. Jordan didn't hog all the screen time. There is a mix of the cartoon characters, Jordan, the other basketball stars, and the supporting cast.The movie is a classic time piece. It might not have won any Academy Awards, but for that time and even now, it's a fun, family, sports, Looney Tunes, crossover.(addition)
I went back to watch the original again because I hadn't seen it in a while. Damn that was a good movie. So much better that that reboot they did recently.",Space Jam
41,southdavid,Jordan Devlin,3,27 February 2020,"I was surprised to learn that the ""How Did That Get Made"" podcast had picked ""Space Jam"" as one of the movies they were going to do. Though I hadn't seen the movie in years, I remember as a 16 year old, taking my younger brother to see it at the cinema - just the two of us and it wasn't, in my memory at least, a bad film. Turns out, they were right, as the movie is a pretty shambolic mix of advertisements and nonsense.With his space amusement park failing, Mr. Swackhammer (Danny DeVito) sends his lackeys to Earth to capture the Looney Tunes characters as his new attraction. Thinking fast, Bugs Bunny (Billy West) says that the Tunes characters have the right to defend themselves in a competition of their choosing. Given the small stature of their captures, Bugs picks Basketball, but the Aliens have a plan, and steal the skills of various NBA players (as well as a series of physical enhancements). Seeing that they'll now struggle, the tunes recruit Michael Jordan to play for their team.Overall it's a bit of a mess. I can actually take the advertisements, they're not as egregious as it's been made out to be in other areas, but the plot is horribly under baked and lacking, the voices sound wrong (mostly because they're different people) and worst of all, it's not funny. Not even slightly. Not even when Bill Murray is in it. The best bits, oddly, revolve around the real human basketball players and their struggles once the aliens have taken their basketball skills. Their visits to hospitals and psychiatrists trying to get to the bottom of it. The animation work is poor too, with the interaction with the real world less convincing than ""Who Framed Roger Rabbit"" despite that being almost a decade later.Michael Jordan actually does OK performance-wise. So much so you wonder why he hasn't taken up acting since his actual retirement and he's unquestionably the greatest NBA player of all time, so I understand the desire to eulogise him in a film like this. But even taking into consideration ""It's a Kids film"", like that's some sort of genuine excuse, ""Space Jam"" is far from a slamdunk.Also. R-Kelly (Shudder).",Space Jam
42,lisafordeay,I actually liked this as a kid and I still do even though I didn't see it in a long time.,7,30 April 2014,"Space Jam is a 1996 live action/animated sports comedy combines animation and it tells the story of a basketball player named Micheal Jordan(as himself)who is on the verge of retiring from the game and is now doing baseball instead. However when he gets sucked into a golf course while playing golf he ends up in the Looney Tunes world and is accompanied with Bugs Bunny who wants Micheal Jordan to play basketball with him and his other Looney Tunes companions as a bunch of aliens(one voiced by Danny De Vito) stole Micheal Jordan's teammates abilities by using a magical basketball and the aliens are now bigger and stronger than the Looney Tunes. So can they win the basketball game and Jordan can go back to the real world again and give back his teammates their abilities again?Overall this movie you can say is sort of a life story of Micheal Jordan's life as a basketball player as you see real life photos of him as a kid and his playing basketball with his father as a kid(played by some young actor) at the beginning of the movie before you hear the Space Jam intro.Final Verdict I really liked this movie as a kid and I still love it to this day. The movie has a great soundtrack from Seal's Fly Like An Eagle to R Kelly's I Believe I Can Fly, to even Basketball Jones with Barry White ft Chris Rock. Let's hope the sequel is going to be good.Overall im giving it a 7.",Space Jam
43,kevin_robbins,"This is far from an all time great animated picture in the Who Framed Roger Rabbit mold, but is still a great and fun family film",7,2 August 2021,"Space Jam (1996) is a movie we recently watched as a family on HBOMAX. The storyline involves the toons being in trouble when some toons from another galaxy arrive and threaten to ruin their world and enslave them. They invaders challenge the toons at a game of basketball and cheat by stealing the skills from current NBA players. The toons only hope is to kidnap Michael Jordan and beg for him to play on their team and save their existence. This movie is directed by Joe Pytka (Lets it Ride) and stars Michael Jordan, Bill Murray (Ghostbusters) and Theresa Randle (Bad Boys). The storyline for this is fun and does a great job of creating villains and tying it back into what is happening back in the real world and outside of toon land. The villains and their set-up might be the best part of this picture. The jokes and interactions of the players whose skills were stolen had me cracking. It is so fun seeing the toons interacting together all in one environment instead of within their own storylines. Bill Murray's cameos are fantastic and the ending was great and a fun way to wrap up the movie. Overall this is far from an all time great animated picture in the Who Framed Roger Rabbit mold, but is still a great and fun family film. I would score this a 6.5/10.",Space Jam

It combines action and cartoons, like Who Framed Roger Rabbit, and both films are equally good. Aliens arrive on Earth, zap the talents of real-life basketball stars like Charles Barkley and Patrick Ewing so they can beat Bugs Buuny and the Loony Tunes gang at SOMETHING, and Bugs and the gang recruit Michael Jordan so they can have a fighting chance.My favorite scenes are the basketball game showdown (that's hilarious! watch for the ""men in black"" reference), the golf scene where they ""recruit"" MJ, and Jordan's baseball scene. Everything about this movie is thoroughly enjoyable, and everyone will love it. Guaranteed. i loved Bill Murray, Wayne Knight, and Larry Bird in it! *** 1/2 out of ****",Space Jam

I loved the 90's & this movie is an absolute product of that lovely time period, when the legendary Michael Jordan was a Basketball super star legend & to put him at the height of his superstardom in a kids animated fantasy adventure was pure genius.Everybody has always loved the Looney Tunes characters & here Michael Jordan is brought to the tunes animated universe to help save their world from an evil group of Monsters/Aliens that need a new attraction for their planets theme park & the great Danny DeVito does the excellent voice work of the evil mastermind ""Swackhammer"" & his group of colourful monster/alien things magically steal some professional NBA players talents & challenge the Looney tunes to a Basketball game & the prize is if they win is to keep their world!!!Bugs Bunny & Daffy Duff mission it to the human world & seek out the greatest player ""Michael Jordan"" for help, that's the plot & it's a blast of amazing animation & hilarious antics but all feelgood family fun.Super star Michael Jordan is actually a really nice presence on screen although not a great actor but that didn't matter because he was himself really & wasn't supposed to give a big powerful performance but he genuinely comes accross as a nice guy & for some reason worked so well surrounded by those maniac Looney Tunes characters & the film hit all the right spots especially for it's time of 1996 & that's why it's held up so well & is cherished by us who grew up in the 90's like myself. Space Jam was a huge event movie & i loved all the merchandise & toys that came out & i brought some of the Awesome Action figures. MJ was a huge part of the 90's & that's why the movie is such a Nostalgic piece for us who grew up watching it & that fondness only grows as time goes on as the film is a time capsule of a better time without all the technology & ever changing everything of today.I love Space Jam & I'm not even a Basketball fan or into any sports & that shows you what a great fun fantasy film it is. You don't have to even like Basketball to enjoy all the craziness of the movie.Space Jam is silly light-hearted family fun that anyone can enjoy & i still do at 37!!!""Space Jam"" is a wonderful fantasy adventure that is just a joy to watch & is buzzing with energy & a sense of Fun. The music is sweet & nice & this Classic is produced by the great IVAN REITMAN, the genius who made both Ghostbusters films, Kindergarten Cop, Evolution, Twins & Junior, so this man knows great fantasy comedy.We also gets an Awesome & hilarious little role from comic genius BILL MURRAY!!! There's also the big funny guy, Wayne Knight (Jurassic Park) & famous faces from the NBA.All in all ""Space Jam"" is a Comedy CLASSIC from the 90's that i have a big soft spot for & have always loved.Big Nostalgia Love for this lovely product of it's time.The only thing that hasn't aged well with the film is of course having R.

46,aidanratesmovies,Pure Nostalgia,8,14 July 2021,"Like the Looney Tunes cartoons themselves, they may not have the deepest plot, but thankfully the film captures the fun spirit and humor of the infamous characters just enough to make quite an enjoyable and memorable ride. First i'll address my problems with the film. Like I said before, the plot isn't anything special,and truly amounts as an excuse to get ordan and these characters on the screen together. Jordan is obviously not known for acting, and it can show in certain parts of the film, but for a sports star in his film debut- he's honestly not TOO bad. I also found it kind out of place how they sexualized Lola Bunny, as the main female character, it feels like they definitely could have spent a bit more time developing her character rather than simply someone for people to gush over. That all being said,there is a lot of fun to be had with this film. The CGI is dated, but funny nevertheless, and the use of the 2D animation even in human settings is surprisingly done quite well. I love the look and design of all the Tune characters, as well as the voice actors throughout. The soundtrack is catchy and timely, and all together very enjoyable, and fitting for this 'sports film.' The film is also ridiculously entertaining and quite fast paced, and I laughed many times while watching it, even with having seen it over a dozen times before. At first glance, it may not seem like much other than a timely cash grab to appeal to kids- but at its core the film is very heartfelt and memorable. It may not be a deep film, but its a guilty pleasure I certainly will never get tired of anytime soon.My Rating: 8.4/10.",Space Jam
47,questl-18592,Jam On,7,8 March 2020,"Nostalgia dies hard sometimes. I loved this movie when I was a kid. I wasn't even a basketball fan yet seeing Michael Jordan step into the world of Looney Toons for a goofy, cartoon game against alien Monstars? Oh that hit me just right.Watched this for the first time in a long time a couple days ago and, despite the fact that now I'm older and more critical, I can't deny that this transported me right back to when I was a kid.That being said, this movie is ridiculous. It makes no sense whatsoever and the second you stop to ask why or how it either falls apart or gives you a headache. The acting is not great, but at the same time, Jordan's not an actor and considering this movie has to be like 80% him just living in a green screen world, it's pretty impressive and I'll forgive him for not having all his eyelines down.I'd be really curious to see someone watch this now who didn't watch this as a kid. Like I said, nostalgia plays heavily with me on this and I know it. Seeing someone come to this fresh would be fascinating. Regardless, I'd almost say it's worth watching for that soundtrack alone!",Space Jam

There was hardly any of the Looney Tunes fun and frolics that we are used to or that I certainly expected. It seems like it was made in an attempt to keep them relevant and in the public eye while capitalising on Michael Jordan's popularity of the time.I'm afraid it did nothing for me, bar a few laughs. The basketball players were quite obviously not actors and the alien creatures were too much. They took away from the crazies we already know.A poor concept and badly executed, which is a shame, because I was looking forward to a laugh like the ones I used to have as a kid watching my favourite Daffy and Bugs.Mr Jordan seems like a nice guy though.",Space Jam

Michael Jordan gives a solid and charismatic lead performance, Wayne Knight is good and Bill Murray is a scene stealer. The soundtrack is great.",Space Jam
50,Spleen,So whose stupid idea was this?,2,6 February 2000,"The result of this unholy exhumation of Warner Brothers has-beens is even worse than could have been expected: one of the vilest films ever produced in the United States.  It's unique among bad films in the way it starts at the bottom and digs DOWN.  I mean, it's bad enough that it's a basketball movie - the one thing in the world worse than a baseball movie (although baseball finds its way into the plot as well).  It's bad enough that it's one big Michael Jordan publicity still.  Isn't Jordan just the greatest guy in the world! seems to be the only point behind the opening scenes, especially those honey-covered ones with his family.  (Not his real family.)But then we meet the cartoon characters ...  Whoever's responsible for the animation has evidently mistaken motion for life, because we have all the frenetic running around, squashing, stretching and camera-swerving of the world's most over-produced computer game - all in vain.  Consider `The Rabbit of Seville', with its staid camera work and underplayed Bugs Bunny. It had less than a third of the motion on display in `Space Jam' - and more than four times as much energy.But it gets worse.  Oh, believe me, does it get worse!  I don't know why they made Bugs Bunny the star - he is NOT the most successful creation of Warner Brothers, not by a long shot.  Indeed he's scarcely a character at all.  He's whatever a talented director makes of him.  There's the anarchic Bugs of Tex Avery; the innocent, childlike Bugs of Chuck Jones; the (it must be said) dull, vulgar Bugs of Friz Freleng; and the (sorry) just plain dull Bugs of Robert McKimson.  This Bugs is worse than any of them.  All the inconsistenies have been added together, and new ones added.  Remember what a signal failure the modern-day Mickey Mouse of Disney's `Runaway Brain' was?  You ain't seen nothing yet.I have not yet begun to describe what's wrong with the cartoon bits.  Every second of animation is manic but serves no purpose any of the writers might have had, economic motives aside.  The art direction is just terrible  It's all painfully unfunny.  And remember what happened when the Warner Brothers cartoons began to die in the first place, in the 1960s?  They were no longer fresh, and writers desperately tried to jolly things along by casting more and more characters alongside each other, with predictable results.  Too many zany characters cancel each other out.  Well, `Space Jam' combines EVERY SINGLE Warner Brothers character in the one work, and they all do their zany schtick at once - you can imagine how counter-productive this is. No, on second thoughts, you probably I can't.  It's worse than you can imagine.And it CONTINUES to get worse.  We're introduced to a new Warner Brothers star (star? hah!) - a `sexy' female rabbit, a feisty basketball player who blows back her ears and says, `Don't call me doll.'  Some rap music worms its way into the soundtrack.  The climactic basketball game is even more ineptly staged than the earlier scenes would have led us to expect. Possibly worst of all, the slender and soulless plot is laden with enough contrived sentiment to make us scream, `Oh, come ON!  No-one in the WORLD is so easily manipulated!'One final note - something that pleases me.  `Space Jam' received its first outing on Australian television only because a cricket game which the network had expected to take place, didn't.  THAT puts the movie in its place.  Basketball, too.",Space Jam

52,breakdownthatfilm-blogspot-com,No Roger Rabbit but it still scores high,9,25 August 2012,"It's hard to get sport celebrities in with big name franchises. The main reason why it's difficult is because of how well the celebrity can act. Michael Jordan is no Oscar nominee but his acting isn't bad and he fits in well with his surroundings. Even if they are a bunch of post- production drawings.Space Jam is the story of a once really good basketball player, Michael Jordan, who ends up off his game. But it's not until he's brought back to life and into the world of playing basketball when he runs into some very looney characters. These individuals are none other than the Looney Tunes characters. The Tunes' problem is that they've been challenged by a group of aliens who call themselves ""The Monstars"" to a game of basketball and if they lose, they surrender their freedom to becoming main attractions to a lousy theme park known as ""Moron Mountain"".The owner of Moron Mountain is Swackhammer played by Danny DeVito, who oddly enough sounds a lot like Phil from Disney's Hercules (1997). Unfortunately, the rest of the voice actors who play the Looney Tunes characters are not performed by Mel Blanc or by his son. That's just one of two problems I have with this film. I'm not saying they're not good but Blanc is the best.Daffy Duck's voice just isn't the same. It is close, but it's not the right fit. At least the casting department could have had Joe Alaskey from Looney Tunes: Back In Action (LTBIA)(2003) to do Daffy's voice. His imitation was much better. And as a personal favorite I would've preferred to see Marvin the Martian have more screen time than just being a ref for the game. LTBIA had more screen time for him even if he was an antagonist.Besides this, everything else was done really well. The animation is good as are the sequences where live-action takes over which were also very well executed. The jokes are great too. Even adding in a love interest for Bugs was an interesting take. Too bad Lola was cut from LTBIA. The music, composed by James Newton Howard was also great to listen to. It had all the characteristics one would expect to hear in a live-action animation feature film. Space Jam combines live-action animation and sports to create a kid/adult friendly film for everyone to enjoy. The music, jokes and characters (including Michael Jordan) are all respectable.",Space Jam

54,KUAlum26,Judge it on its own merit and it's quite good,8,1 December 2007,"Some of the complaints of this film,if I recall correctly,was that it seemed to skimp on the Looney Tunes characters,added characters that weren't of any great likability or memorability and seemed to make Michael Jordan into a sort of caricature/parody of himself. And while I suppose this movie doesn't seem particularly true to either the element of animation or to MJ(though,I'd say,between the two,Jordan comes away as the winner and I'll explain why),this still is a perfectly good piece of entertainment for the whole family.Aliens come to earth seeming innocuous enough(they measure in inches) but they have a less-than honorable mission:they want to take the Looney Tunes characters back to their planet and make them into something just above slaves for their entertainment. Bugs Buny,infinitely confident,challenges the critters to a game of basketball. They respond by siphoning the talents of five of the top players of the day(PAtrick Ewing,Tyrone ""Mugsy""Bogues,Charles BArkley,Shawn Bradley and Larry Johnson. What?! No Scottie Pippen??). To counterbalance this,Bugs and company turn to his old Nike commercial-making days,and the battle is on.To me,this movie succeeds on it's own merit,and this could be no better demonstrated than by the co-star himself. Jordan plays nobody but himself,and his un-forced sense reaction to the situations actually works well to balance the zaniness around him. An almost un-credited cameo by Bill Murray just about steals the movie. All the familiar characters from the universe of WArner Toons are along for the ride,plus some new ones(a sexy,girl cager rabbit name Lola,as well as the globby aliens,led by a cigar-chomping boss voiced by Danny DeVito)to lend their various talents(Daffy Duck's neuroses are particularly enjoyable)and while this is hardly the best work of animation here(Mel Blanc's invaluable voice is missed,of course),this still works. THe live-action characters seem to be compromised some--THeresa Randle as Michael's wife and Wayne KNight as his harried manager come to mind--but that seems to be a fairly minor crime for a film that aims to be as big,bold,fanciful and childlike as possible. I don't think you need to be a fan of Looney Tunes or necessarily know that much about pro basketball(in fact,it might help!)to enjoy this film,just an ability to appreciate this rarefied blend of familiar animation with commercial savvy.",Space Jam
55,jeremycrimsonfox,One Of My Favorite Films Growing Up,9,9 March 2020,"Space Jam is one of my favorite childhood films. Set during Michael Jordan's struggling baseball career, the basketball legend is summoned to Looney Tune Land as it faces it biggest crisis: little aliens from an intergalactic amusement park have been sent to force them there as entertainment, and after challenging them to a basketball game, the aliens decide to take the talent of the best basketball players of the time and use it to transform into Monstars.Yeah, this is a good movie. The story is set around real life (as Michael is playing baseball) and it has some good characters. Wayne Knight (best known for playing Newman in Seinfeld and Dennis Nerdy in Jurassic Park) plays Stanley Podolak, who serves as one of the comic reliefs of the movie, and the film would be the one to introduce Lola Bunny, a female bunny who Bugs would have a crush on. Also, NBA players Charles Barkley, Patrick Ewing, Shawn Bradley, Larry Johnson, and Muggsy Bogues, who were NBA greats at the time of the film, star as the players who get their talent stolen, and even Bill Murray and Larry Bird are in this.For voice work, Billy West (best known to some as the voice of Phillip J. Fry in Futurama as well as the red M&M) voices Bugs Bunny and Elmer Fudd, with Kath Souric voicing Lola. Danny DeVito voices the film's villain, Swackhammer. The voice acting is perfect, as the actors nail the characters they voice.As for humor, there is plenty of it. Otherwise, it wouldn't be Looney Tunes.

56,Beta_Gallinger,A hit-and-miss live action/animated crossover,6,10 August 2009,"This 1996 live action/animated crossover, starring then-basketball champion Michael Jordan as himself, plus the popular Looney Tunes characters, was obviously a success. I never saw it around that time in the late 90's, but clearly remember the craze, with all the merchandise. I was familiar with the Looney Tunes characters (at least most of them) from old cartoons I had seen. Although I've certainly never been an avid follower of professional basketball (or any sport you see on TV, for that matter), I was also familiar with Jordan, as this was his heyday, and he had a huge reputation. Despite all this, I didn't see ""Space Jam"" until last night. A few years ago, I saw ""Looney Tunes: Back in Action"", and remember hating it, but despite my fairly low expectations for its predecessor, this one does have some redeeming qualities.Michael Jordan announces his retirement from the NBA and switches to professional baseball, but is not very successful with this sport. Meanwhile, on a distant planet, Mr. Swackhammer owns a theme park called Moron Mountain. He is desperate for new attractions for his park, and thinks the Looney Tunes would be great. He sends his minions, five small aliens known as the ""Nerdlucks"" (Pound, Blanko, Nawt, Bupkus, and Bang) to Looney Tune Land, below the surface of the Earth, to capture the Looney Tunes and force them to act as attractions for Moron Mountain, whether they like it or not! However, Bugs Bunny tricks them into agreeing to a basketball game, which will determine whether Moron Mountain gets them as attractions, or they remain free. Since the Nerdlucks are so small, the Looney Tunes figure they can easily clobber them in the sport, but the clever aliens steal the talent of several NBA players and become the giant Monstars! Knowing this won't be as easy as they thought, the Looney Tunes recruit Michael Jordan for the competition. For much of the film, it seemed I would only be able to rate it 5/10. I found that the plot was pretty dull, and most of it wasn't that funny (though there are some funny moments early on, such as Bugs Bunny telling the Nerdlucks he hasn't seen Bugs Bunny). I really don't know how to go into details about this, but for me, these were problems that brought the movie down in quality. However, to me it eventually improved, and I started finding it funnier. The cartoon characters in the film can sometimes be funny, and Stan Podolak, Michael Jordan's assistant played by Wayne Knight, can also be quite comical, especially later in the film. (Mind you, despite all the good jokes, there is a major fart joke towards the end, unfortunately.) Also, Jordan doesn't put on that bad a performance, considering the fact that he's not an actor, the film has some nice animation, and the big basketball competition is intense. With these qualities, ""Space Jam"" certainly isn't classic family fare, but they're enough to make it a mixed blessing.

Despite the fact the film stars all the Warner Bros Looney Tunes characters the whole thing is really all about Michael Jordan. A fictional account of a small segment in his career if you will. So if you haven't already guessed the film is also all about basketball, this makes me wonder if the film was as much of a hit here in the UK as it inevitably was in the US. Obviously the Looney Tunes characters had a lot to do with the appeal for many as the film serves as more of an animated adventure rather than a true basketball feature. That being said it does give plenty for both sides of this spectrum.Should I really have a go at the plot? this is after all a cartoon of sorts. Basically MJ must do battle on the court against some aliens who want him to be their slave within their intergalactic theme park. Thing is these crafty aliens have pinched the talents of fellow NBA All-Stars Muggsy Bogues, Larry Johnson, Shawn Bradly, Pat Ewing and Charles Barkley (what about John Stockton or Scottie Pippen?). So end of the day its Michael Jordan vs a selection of other NBA players, guess who wins? I wonder what the films trying to say?.As far as an animated flick goes this is a fun time, its bright bold and colourful, there's plenty of toon action, the usual visual gags, in- jokes, sly homages etc...and of course the WB roster is always good see. The problems I have is the fact the animation is nowhere near as good as the classic original toons of Chuck Jones and co naturally...and they never will be ever again. The voice talent is nowhere near as good as Mel Blanc and co...and they never will be again. Plus of course they mix in CGI with hand drawn animation which kinda works in places but looks awful in others.I think the worst voice work going in this film must be the attempt at 'Pepe Le Pew'. Wasn't a fan of the stereotypical female version of Bugs either, wasn't required, was just added for the young female audience and felt totally out of place. On the other hand the baddie alien characters weren't too bad if a little bland, they became more interesting in massive monster mode of course. I think if I were Bradly I might have been upset my animated alter ego was made out to be a slow towering numbskull. Using Danny Devito as the chief alien badguy was a smart move, again his character wasn't overly intriguing and kinda standard in design but it worked.The actual basketball game is good fun even though you'd think it wouldn't be. Its certainly looney, has some slick moments, a nice 'Pulp Fiction' homage, the gag about Michael's special drink is cute, its fun watching the lofty NBA Stars trying to act and Bill Murray adds some much needed fizz for adults. You know what happens in the end, its no surprise, luckily it is a good ride getting there. Definitely an unexpected hit straight outta left field.6.5/10",Space Jam
58,Stampsfightclub,why the negativity?,8,13 November 2008,"Michael Jordan is sucked into Looney Tune land to help Bugs Bunny and co win a basketball game against 5 aliens who will make them slaves if they lose.The Looney Tunes are a great creation. The wackiness and imagination behind each character is a simple bliss. And each character is brought to the big screen in this sports comedy which has received disappointing reviews. It is a wonder why this film is looked at negatively considering that it is funny and is ultimately light hearted entertainment.With one of the best positive songs to ever open a film, Space Jam dives deep into one of basketball's all time greats in Michael Jordan.As the title song by Quad City DJ pounds out ""Welcome to the Space Jam, alright!"" we are immediately uplifted and shown numerous pictures from Jordan's life as a basketball player, giving the audience a reflection on the passage to stardom. Sweet, if somewhat cliché inspirational.After Jordan declares he is to leave basketball to become a baseball player we are taken to a typically evil setting, a theme park run by Danny De Vito's Mr Swackhammer, that ugly looking animated evil genius.And then the real fun begins as we see comparisons from real life to fantasy and a charm and sweetness about the extraordinary is encoded to give a feel of light-heartedness.Ultimately Space Jam is actually really funny because it is so silly. There is little realism with just in time situations and how humans actually get into Looney Tune land, but is this a film to give explanation to anything? No. This 1996 Pytka picture is about entertaining the whole family and it does just that.This is a film anyone from the family can sit back and enjoy. The likability of the Looney Tunes will make children laugh, especially the slapstick humour. The basketball players who lose their talents are great viewing for the elder viewers, pure real life styled comedy.The acting from everyone, especially Jordan is poor. Bill Murray (Lost in Translation) is in a small role and as always is great to watch.The music from this picture is outstanding, perfectly fitting to the narrative. From the opening song to Seal's ""Fly like an eagle"" we are given perfect harmony. Not to forget R Kelly's I believe I can fly which speaks for itself.The plot is always entertaining and equally predictable. However the comedy, the likability and relaxation of the film is good enough reason to sit back and enjoy",Space Jam
59,Mister-6,"We be ""Jam""min'...",10,9 February 2000,"For the first time in his illustrious career, Michael ""Air"" Jordan shares the court and the spotlight with some of the most intimidating players in basketball...most of which have fur and feathers.""Space Jam"" melds real-life and cartoon-life as well as in ""Who Framed Roger Rabbit"" and with about the same result.  No one can say that they skimped on the FX, or the story - which yields some mighty big laughs.Seems that Looney Tune Land is under threat from aliens from an other-worldly amusement park and the only way Bugs, Daffy, Porky and Tweety can save themselves from intergalactic slavery is by challenging them to a basketball game.  But when the aliens in question acquire powers from Earth's best b-ball players (Ewing, Barkley, Bogues, etc.) and become Mon-Stars, Bugs and company acquire the newly-retired Jordan to help them get game.Jordan is comfortable in front of the camera, even when surrounded by cartoon characters and Bill Murray (!), so he proves he has even a future as a movie star, especially in movies like this.  And as if there were ever a doubt, Bugs Bunny shows he still has what it takes after all these years.I love this movie; I've always been a fan of animation and ""Space Jam"" doesn't disappoint.  Every figure, shadow and shade of skin is perfect and shares screen time with real people so seamlessly that, sure, it looks real enough that we could be surprised that this kind of thing doesn't happen every day.Anyway, you have to love a movie where Murray's big entrance is heralded by someone shouting ""I didn't know Dan Aykroyd was in this picture!""Ten stars and a pair of Nikes for ""Space Jam"".

New characters were developed specifically for this film too, there's Lola Bunny and the MonStars. Who can forget Danny DeVito as the voice of their leader?

63,mitsubishizero,Enjoyable though its flaws are more apparent.,7,1 November 2018,"I grew up watching this as a kid and while I still like it, I'll be the first to admit it's definitely a product of the times. People are divided over this movie and it's not hard to see why. The movie's more like a commercial in disguise of a movie like The Wizard and probably the most critical of the movie was the legendary Chuck Jones but i'll get to that later. Many people agree that Michael Jordan can't act and to some extant I agree. The reason that doesn't bother me is because for what it's worth he does a decent job playing himself lost in an animated world full of insanity.The story's basically the Looney Tunes forcibly recruiting Michael Jordan who retired from basketball to help them defeat the Monstars who want to put them in their amusement park on the home planet for their boss (voiced by Danny Devito). This's what Chuck Jones strongly disliked about the movie claiming that Bugs would've never needed MJ or the other tunes' help in defeating the antagonists regardless of their size and it would've been under 6-7 minutes had it stuck to the source material.Anyway, the movie's not bad but I can see why some people don't like it: Like I said earlier Michael Jordan can't really act but I don't know. I think he did ok considering this was out of his comfort zone. He plays the fish out of water pretty well. It's cool to see most if not all the Looney Tunes characters interact with each other which you don't see often in the original shorts. The characters are cool but I noticed Billy West voices Bugs and while it's not bad he gives Bugs more of a nasal voice which can be a little distracting. Bill Murray's character's more of a cameo that doesn't really help further the plot and while some people think Wayne Knight's annoying in this movie he doesn't get under my skin. In fact I think he's kind've funny. Last but not least is Lola Bunny whom isn't bad I just wish she had more scenes as well as more character development.Bottom line, the movie's not great but it's not bad. If anything it's enjoyable in a strange way. Check it out for yourself.",Space Jam

I still remember how I laughed as a kid , when I was watching this movie for the first time. I did watch it at least a couple of times and I still have good memories regarding it . So , I was surprised not in a positive way when I saw the not too good rating (5.9) of ""Space jam"" here on IMDb. Also while surfing the web I often found not too many pleasant comments from other people about this movie . It gave me motivation to find some free time to watch ""SJ"" and confront my childhood's memories with reality. After all many things that we've liked as kids aren't that good when we look at them from the point of view of adult.So , I've seen the movie for the first time since childhood . And you know what ? The film itself lacks either the energy or the visual invention that the Chuck Jones originals had. For visual humour, it tends to substitute one-liners and lame pop culture in-jokes.""Space jam"" not only has Michael Jordan and Bugs Bunny in it , but also Wayne Knight (""Jurassic park"") , Bill Murray (""Ghostbusters"") , famous basketball players ( Larry Johnson , Charles Barkley, Patrick Ewing ) and all the Looney tunes characters . ""Space jam"" also introduces original characters to the audience – the aliens ( Moonstars) and Lola . I must say that I love Lola . She's a great original Looney Tunes character . She's a wonderful partner for Bugs , yet she has her own personality. I wish that Warner Bros would use her in the future , especially if the will make new Looney Tunes cartoons. The aliens are also nice . Moonstars look funny as the caricatures of famous basketball players . The certainly are memorable villains , just like their boss.The animation looks alright to me . Only the CGI alien amusement park has dated badly . Joe Pytka directs the movie like a normal movie with some cartoon elements in it instead of choosing Joe Dante way in ""Looney tunes back in action"" and making it a live action cartoon. In terms of acting Bugs and team are the best . Murray and Knight give a fun performance . Jordan and others are OK since they basically playing themselves.The soundtrack is good with great songs like : R. Kelly "" I believe I can fly "" , Seal ""Fly like eagle "" , Coolio , LL Cool J and Method Man ""Beat them up"".""Space Jam"" is a feature-length expansion of a Pepsi commercial that paired Bugs Bunny and NBA star Michael Jordan.

I hate it when people insist that people play sports from a young age. If you like it, then play it, but don't go around telling people to play as if it's something everyone should do or they don't have a life. People are way too centered around sports, and it kinda comes off as annoying. I do have my respect for Michael Jordan, and how he inspired many generations to play Basketball. He was the best!This movie was made in the right decade where it was the Golden Age of Cartoons. I do love Cartoons myself, but not the modern ones which is not my cup of coffee. It isn't anything like Michael Jordan, not any deep-meaning storyline or great characters. It's about fun and cartoons, or it was the friends we made along the way. I'm joking. I highly recommend this to any Basketball fans out there who haven't seen it. The soundtrack is absolutely amazing.COME ON AND SLAM, COME ON AND SLAM, COME ON AND SLAM AND WELCOME TO THE JAM! The hard-working animation is great.I don't care that Michael Jordan couldn't act in this one. He was being the greatest basketball player of all time, not an actor.

His appearances with Bugs & Company in past TV commercials put the tall guy into greater stardom than on the court. Here's where the magic is!Frankly, SPACE JAM is a swift update for the LOONEY TUNES cast due to some modernized comedy. I can't believe Porky Pig actually said he wet his pants! It's no surprise this got a PG rating, and that's largely due to the animated effects of Jordan and other real-life humans sucking into holes, which is amusing, but points out the subject of ""mild violence"". It's not bad as it is cartoonish. To say it simple, it's great fun for all ages because of Bugs, Daffy, & Company who have timelessly entertained us for decades.When Jordan spoke his words about retiring, there's one thing he forgot to say to the public: ""TH-TH-TH-TH-THAT'S ALL FOLKS!""",Space Jam

71,Min111,Looney Tunes are in action,5,10 June 2020,"I liked Space Jam. I thought it was a fine movie. Here, the Looney Tunes are in action. It's a movie where you get to see many of your favourite characters: Barnyard Dawg, Bugs Bunny, Daffy Duck, Elmer Fudd, Foghorn Leghorn, Lola Bunny, Marvin the Martian, Porky Pig, Sylvester, Tasmanian Devil, Tweety, Yosemite Sam etc. There were so many of them, and only this movie, Space Jam, is able to show you them. I liked them all (characters), but my favourite ones are Bugs Bunny and Daffy Duck. I think both of them make a good rivalry, but they have to work together as a team/unit, and take on a character called Swackhammer who forms his own team known as Monstars. The Looney Tunes call themselves as the 'Tune Squad'. The character, Swackhammer, was played by none other than Danny DeVito (to my surprise), and he was excellent in the movie. He even kind of looks like the character he played which I found very funny. I like the title for this movie, Space Jam, and think it's such a cool name. This is a good movie about Basketball; it's a movie which can get you to like the sport. Let's not forget the other sports shown in this movie - Baseball and Golf. Basketball is one of the most popular sports in the world, and has the greatest Basketball player ever in ""Space Jam"" called Michael Jordan. He was great in this movie, and was the difference between the two teams. Can the 'Looney Tunes' do it? Can they win? Can they defeat them? You have to see it to find out. I remember how popular this movie was when it first came out. I use to own this on video, and use to watch it several times. I like the soundtracks in Space Jam.

75,elicopperman,Corporate Commerce Disguised as a Movie,3,17 July 2020,"Some cult movies age well, some cult movies don't so much, and some cult movies divide audiences heavily: Space Jam is among the third category. This whole movie was essentially a corporate brain-child to make a movie based on these basketball commercials with Michael Jordan and Bugs Bunny, and when it was out, it gained enough success to garnish a following amongst a whole generation of 90s kids. So now that its legacy is leading us to a sequel next year, how exactly does this movie age? Well, in my eyes, it ages fine...as much as any other dated sports movie.The plot focuses on an evil alien theme park owner named Swackhammer who sends his gang, the Nerdlucks, to kidnap Bugs Bunny and the Looney Tunes for put in the theme park. When Bugs bet their lives on a basketball game to determine their fate, the aliens steal the powers of NBA basketball players, causing Bugs to get help from superstar Michael Jordan. Insane concept enough, and yet that right there sums up the movie's core problem: how determined it is to sell out. As a 90s sports movie, it does little to stand out from the crowd, but considering how obvious the executive meddling was behind the scenes to sell Nike products, it broke the cardinal sin of souring the Looney Tunes even more. Had this been a 7 minute short, Bugs Bunny would have taken the bad guys down so fast, and he wouldn't even need the help from any basketball celebrity. It never feels like anyone of the staff knew how to balance the Looney Tunes or Air Jordan gimmick well, but what would you expect when basing your movie off of corporate commerce?Beyond that, the movie's structure is so weak, as it goes from being about Michael Jordan's career from basketball to baseball, to suddenly being about an inter-galactic amusement park, to the aliens taking away the talents of basketball players, to the Looney Tunes and Jordan teaming up, and yawns ensue. The film's first half is so rushed just to get to the big game that you feel like you need to take a breather after watching it, not helped by the exhausting amount of exposition. If you can't make up your mind on whether your movie is a biopic on Michael Jordan or a weird sports-fantasy Looney Tunes vehicle, either pick one or the other. It feels more like the film focused on the icing more than the cake, because even some scenes that should last about a minute go on for way too long, especially with an unnecessary padded-out B-plot concerning the aforementioned NBA players such as Patrick Ewing and Charles Barkley, who like Jordan himself, can't act to save their lives. It's almost as if there are three different movies in this one 90-minute cluster.Now if there's anything positive to say about the movie, for its time the visuals looked impressive, and not just the wacky and upbeat animation done on the Looney Tunes characters. The huge scope of the movie between the intergalactic amusement park and the insane attention to detail around the basketball stadium is astounding, especially given how much compositing was put into the crowd. That, and even most of the Looney Tunes voice-actors such as Billy West, Dee Baker, Bill Farmer and Bob Bergen did seem to have fun with the material they were given, even if it was third-rate. Unfortunately, that's where the positives sorta seize, and you know some characters like Lola Bunny and Swackhammer are so bland and paper-thin that not even talents like Kath Soucie and DannyDeVito can save them. However, at least Lola went from every other hot-girl archetype into a more fully realized character in later Looney Tunes incarnations; the same cannot be said for those obnoxious Nerdlucks they're so irritating.In the end, Space Jam may be fondly remembered by generations of 90s kids, but to anyone else, it's little more than a cynical cash-grab from Warner Bros. to capitalize on the popularity of both Looney Tunes and Michael Jordan through corporate synergy...and yet it worked. To this day, there's still the occasional merchandising of the Tasmanian devil in Chicago Bulls attire, and the movie was replayed in theaters for its 20th anniversary. With a sequel planned to come out next year, until time will tell if LeBron James, Malcolm D. Lee and Warners nowadays can at least do a better job than Joe Pytka and Ivan Reitman.",Space Jam

Even though the film doesn't hold up as well now for me, there is still some fun to be had with Space Jam.Space Jam follows the Looney Tunes as they ask Michael Jordon for his help to win a basketball match against a group of aliens that want to enslave them for their theme park.This was a childhood favourite of mine. Seeing the Looney Tunes play with an iconic basketball player like Michael Jordan was something I didn't expect but I loved it a lot as a kid. Watching it today, I see how silly and outdated the film really is. This is a film that could only come from the 90's. A lot of the 2D animation does hold up but when Michael Jordan enters the 2D world, the CGI is very obvious. Some of the effects involving Jordan and the green screen do look bad for today's standards. It's also evident how Michael Jordan isn't an actor. His performance is very wooden and doesn't come off as natural at all. The Looney Tunes are fun and the voice acting is great even though the storyline is incredibly cheesy and predictable.I do have a personal bias towards Space Jam because of how nostalgic this film is to me. However, watching this as an adult, I can see how silly, corny and dated Space Jam really is.

You see Moron Mounatin, located in outer space, is struggling for patrons, so the boss decides to try to kidnap the Looney Tunes guys. In a shrewd move, Bugs Bunny manages to stave off the kidnapping by getting them to agree to a basketball match to decide their fate. If his squad loses, the Looney Tunes characters move to Moron Mountain as entertainers forever. If they win, they are free. Sounds fair. But then the Moron Mountain squad decides to play dirty and goes and steals the talents of some of the NBA elite. The Looney Tunes manage a coup of their own, signing up the greatest player ever, Michael Jordan. The teams train and prepare for the biggest games of their lives. What will be the Looney Tunes fate?

They were, essentially, the very reason we were all into animation in the first place, and we were all a bit upset about the current sneaker commercials that featured the characters playing second-fiddle to athletes.  So, as you might imagine, when one student mentioned that he had heard a rumor that they were going to make a *movie* based on the commercials, we took the news in the same way lots of people reacted to the ""Star Wars Episode II"" rumor that Boba Fett may turn out to be JarJar Binks in disguise.I could totally rip this movie apart, but I don't happen to have the energy. Just know that, indeed, the classic Bugs Bunny we all know and adore would need *NO* help in defeating the (ergh) ""Mean Team"".  (OH, hahaha!  I get it! Oh, brilliance!  Oh rapturous laughter such a pun hath generated!)  I can also sum up, in two words, the gut-wrenching, toe-curling, fan-pooping-on badness of this *thing*:  Lola Bunny.  Yes, even the once totally anarchic Looney Tunes must bow to (cringes) Political Correctness and have a Strong Female Character retrofitted into their world.  I am so touched by this decision, I think I just might vomit.""Space Jam"" is getting a two only for its parody value and the admittedly funny out-of-nowhere visual shout-out to Quentin Tarantino.  Which has in all likelyhood been cut out.",Space Jam
84,TheHonestCritic,"The main lesson of this film is: never have the ""Looney Tunes"" characters play basketball. Ever!",4,1 August 2021,"""Space Jam"" (1996), for those of you who may not know, I'm a devoted fan of the ""Looney Tunes"" cartoons. In fact, ""Looney Tunes"" is one of my top ten all-time favorite animated shows! I remember very vaguely when this ""movie"" was brand new. Although, I was around four years old at the time! When I watched ""Space Jam"" for the first time, I was either eight or nine and I did like it, somewhat. However, when I watched it years later, I just found myself feeling empty and disappointed. Then, the more I saw it, the more the problems just continued to show on the screen. ""Space Jam"" has a dumb and cliched storyline, standard to horrible acting, and a boring soundtrack to try and tie it all together. The plot is, the ""Looney Tunes"" characters must win a basketball game in order to earn their freedom. So, they enlist the help of basketball champion Michael Jordan. Yes, it's just as stupid as it sounds. It's basically real-life humans entering the animated world and cartoon characters uttering one-liners and corny dialogue, while trying to give some sort of resemblance of a performance. Watching this ""film"" today, there is next to no humor, I don't feel any kind of tension and for the most part, nothing happens. To tell you the truth, the biggest reason I gave into watching this ""movie"", was because the ""Looney Tunes"" were in it! There are other films out there that do a much better job putting animated characters, including ""Looney Tunes"", with real-life people. A few prime examples are: ""Mary Poppins"" (1964), ""Who Framed Roger Rabbit"" (1988) and ""Looney Tunes: Back in Action"" (2003). Those three movies are phenomenal, and they all mix animation with live-action seamlessly. Unfortunately, ""Space Jam"" looks extremely lazy and rushed. Also, some of you already know this, but if you don't, I'm not a fan of sports. However, since ""Space Jam"" is just a ""film"", I'm able to overlook that fact. There are plenty of sports movies I enjoy, including basketball films. That being said, ""Looney Tunes"" and basketball do not go together, at all. Listen, I'm all for reinventing a genre while pushing the envelope. But, ""Space Jam"" goes way too far with it's overall premise. The fact that I liked it as a kid just blows my mind! As for the acting, it's a big letdown. The best performances come from the voice actors of the ""Looney Tunes"" characters. At this point, the one and only Mel Blanc was dead and they needed different voice actors for the main characters. I thought the ones they got did a decent job! Sadly, the dialogue is what ruined everything for me. But, probably the worst performance in this ""movie"" is from Michael Jordan. To be fair, he is trying very hard and it shows here. Because, for the most part, he's reacting to nothing but a green or blue screen. He may have been putting effort into his role, but the most crucial thing was missing here, acting! As far as the soundtrack goes, it's about as boring and cliched as you can get. To be fair, there are some good parts in this film score. But overall, it's nothing to write home about. The crazy thing is, that this soundtrack was composed by James Newton-Howard! I was shocked by that, because he has written some great film scores for other movies. What happened to him here? Now, let's get to the only two good elements in this piece of garbage. The only good things are the sets/locations and the special effects. All of the sets/locations are great and give this ""film"" a decent atmosphere. As far as the special effects go, all of them are well-done and still hold up to this day. They do get a little cheesy at times, but for a ""movie"" like this, it's warranted. ""Space Jam"" is, quite possibly, the biggest disappointment in all of ""Looney Tunes"" media. I'm giving this ""film"" 2 out of 5 stars on my personal scale, which equates to 4 out of 10 IMDB stars. Just stay away from ""Space Jam"", even if you're a ""Looney Tunes"" fan. This ""movie"" disgraces those iconic characters, don't watch it. The crazy thing is, that it somehow milked a sequel, called: ""Space Jam: A New Legacy"" (2021)! Of course, I'm not interested in seeing it. Especially due to the fact that they actually had the balls to make the ""Looney Tunes"" characters into CGI abominations. ""Looney Tunes"" has suffered the CGI touch of death! Any way, for the sake of your decency, avoid ""Space Jam"" at all costs. You'll wind up with nothing but pure emptiness and disappointment!",Space Jam

86,Donatien3,A Silly Nostalgia Trip,7,4 October 2020,"For kids (and teenagers) of the 90s, ""Space Jam"" was a big deal: the Looney Tunes AND Michael Jordan? In an ambitious live action-animation hybrid? And it's got Bill Murray, Danny DeVito, Newman from ""Seinfeld"", and a bunch of NBA stars (including Larry Bird, Charles Barkley, Shawn Bradley, Patrick Ewing, Larry Johnson, and Muggsy Bogues)? What's not to love?So, after 25 years, has it aged well?Not really, but it's still enjoyable, even though it sometimes feels like 90-minute ad for Michael Jordan: not that there's anything wrong with that, as MJ was THE 90s cultural icon.The tenuous plot involves MJs real life transition from basketball to baseball, and a scheme from a run-down outer space theme park to steal Bugs and the gang. Long story short, the Tunes recruit MJ to play the Monstars, who have stolen the aforementioned NBA players' talents. It's all very silly and full of plot holes, but whatever.While youngsters will love the wacky, colourful, slapstick Looney Tunes humour, adults will enjoy the meta gags, and 90s pop/R&B soundtrack.If you're after a pure nostalgia trip, give this another shot, just don't expect it to be as magical as it seemed in 1996.",Space Jam

I remembered I saw this when my teacher showed it once in class.

The Looney Tunes drag Michael jordan into their world to help them in a basketball match against the Monstars who have stolen the talent from some of the best NBA players on the planet. It was fun immersing the 2 worlds and still holds up 25 years later.",Space Jam
89,Darkjak007,"This is a dumb movie, but it holds a special place in many hearts",6,16 July 2021,"This is one of the decades defined films of the 90s and many people still remember it from their childhood. The fact of the matter is when you look at this movie, it does not hold up remarkably well as when you were a kid. A cash in on the popularity of the times. Michael Jordan and Looney Tunes join forces to beats a group of aliens called the morons. Who've come to earth to enslaved the Looney tunes as attractions for their home moron mountain. The tunes recruit Jordan whose reluctant to return to basketball, after taking up his career in baseball. This movie is 90 subpar comedy where it's bad but tries to be quirky. However at the same time outside of the Looney Tunes which the animation on them looks great and act like Theirselves. The morons get a couple laughs too. This movie just full of just Hokey acting from Jordan's bland tone to Wayne Knight & Bill Murray not being funny it's bad acting through and through. It's not compiled smoothly clearly feels that there are scenes that were missing from this movie Michael goes missing his family doesn't wonders where he is. The Most memorable things from this movie is the basketball game, The morons and Lola. However acknowledging that it does hold a special place in alot of peoples heart. Overall it's a movie that's really geared towards little kids, unless you grew up with this movie you're not gonna feel anything towards it.",Space Jam
90,D_Burke,"An Energetic, Enjoyable, Altogether Fun Movie With Great Animation",9,25 August 2010,"This may sound pathetic, but of all the films I have seen (and I have seen many), ""Space Jam"" holds a special place in my heart. It's actually the first film I saw by myself at the movie theaters. I liked it when I was 14, but I always make sure when I write a review that I see a movie more recently. Movies as I remember them are not always what they are.Fourteen years later, even though Michael Jordan has retired and CGI animation reigns supreme, ""Space Jam"" still stands up. Critics may label it a kid's movie, but its dialogue is funny and far from intelligence insulting. Plus, I thought the overall story was creative and inventive, although a little weird and out there sometimes. But hey, aren't all Looney Tunes a little weird and out there? Aren't those characteristics what has made them relevant throughout many generations?I loved the fact that this movie could have been a vanity piece for Michael Jordan, but it wasn't. The temptation must have been there to make a movie similar to Muhammad Ali's mediocre ""The Greatest"" (1977). After all, Jordan was at the height of his popularity at the time this movie was released, and the Chicago Bulls had just won the NBA Finals that year (with two more championship wins to come).With the Looney Tunes added into the mix, you get a far more creative premise. I really liked how the movie took place circa 1993-1995, from when Jordan retired from the NBA to his notorious stint playing minor league baseball for the Birmingham Barons (a farm team for the Chicago White Sox) to his triumphant return to the Bulls. I would really like to know how the premise came about to have the Looney Tunes characters persuade Jordan to take up basketball again. It doesn't matter who came up with it or how. It was just weaved into the real life story very creatively.As random a plot as it is, the Looney Tunes live in a cartoon community underneath the Earth, and puny aliens from a failing intergalactic amusement park called Moron Mountain come to abduct the cartoon characters for their next attraction. These aliens are not very smart, prompting the clever Bugs Bunny to convince them to challenge the Looney Tunes to a basketball game instead of immediately kidnapping them. The aliens agree, except they also apparently have the ability to steal basketball playing ability (or talent) from real NBA players. Each of the five aliens gets into the brains of Charles Barkley, Patrick Ewing, Larry Johnson, Muggsy Bogues, and Shawn Bradley, and steal their talent. Apparently, this also gives the aliens the ability to shape shift and become large monsters, or ""MonSTARS"", as they are known here.If you really try to insert logic into this plot, you're going to hate this movie. Looney Tunes cartoons were never logical, so why should this plot be? They were always funny and entertaining, and so is this movie.Once Michael Jordan enters their cartoon world, it's amazing how well he interacts with the characters. Perhaps the best scene is when Bugs Bunny kisses Jordan, and the reaction from him that follows. Jordan's not a great actor, obviously, but you really forget while you're watching this movie that he is actually in front of a green screen not talking to anyone. This is by far the best live action and animation combination since ""Who Framed Roger Rabbit"" (1988).There's really little to fault this movie on. It's funny both in animation and real life. Wayne Knight as pushy publicist Stan Podolak was very funny, and Bill Murray (as himself) was especially hilarious, particularly when he joins the Tune Squad. I still love how Daffy Duck asked him how he got to the cartoon world, and he says (in typical Bill Murray style), ""Oh, the producer's a friend of mine. I had one of the teamster's drop me off."" It gets me every time.I highly recommend ""Space Jam"". It is one of the best kids movies ever made, its story is random, but solid, and its a highly enjoyable film, not to mention a fitting tribute to the Looney Tunes and the NBA glory days of the 1990's. And this movie managed to pull this off without letting product placement or short term endorsements get in the way. That feat is still incredible.",Space Jam

97,snowfre,A cult classic with some great Looney moments but a need for more originality,6,14 October 2019,"Most millennials have a relation ""Space Jam"", the 1996 live action/animated film is now more or less widely appreciated as a cult classic and deservingly so. The elements of some good ol' American 90s cheesiness involving basketball superstar Michael Jordan and his family, along with timeless ""Looney Tunes"" moments provides you with this sport comedy. In it, aliens have invaded the world of Loonies and to settle the fate of their future a basket game will take place in which Bugs, Daffy, Lola, Taz and the rest team up with Jordan. Jordan does what he can with his roles which isn't much. His lines are quite limited but it doesn't matter since will see him own the court fused with some Toon powers. The rest of the human cast aren't really showing their best sides off, apart from the always beloved Bill Murray, but the cartoon ensemble are the stars of the show. While much of the focus is on Jordan, ""Space Jam"" is all about the Loonies at the end of the day and they bring you all the whacky, toony, eye-bugging comedy you want. Wether or not ""Space Jam"" can be introduced to today's generation of kids I don't know, but if you are one in the Millenial crew, ""Space Jam"" will you give you a trip down the nostalgia lane in a fantastic manner.",Space Jam
98,Mickey Knox,pleasant watch,6,3 January 2001,"Space Jam is a good entertaining movie. I am a huge basketball fan so there was no way i could have missed this film. Still i expected much more from it. The story is probably known by everyone who got to read this. Bugs, Daffy and the other Looney Tunes, together with Michael Jordan, have to play a match against some aliens that steal the talent of 5 NBA players.It's funny many times, and the idea of mixing real-life and cartoons is very good. If you start watching this, you won't quit til the end, that's for sure. The presence of so many NBA stars is welcomed and adored by all NBA fans out there. Michael is good for his first role and i am convinced that with a little bit of work he could easily become a professional actor. The other NBA stars used in the film are funny, especially Pat Ewing and Charles Barkley, after they lose their talent. Also you'll get to see plaing themselves other stars like Mugsey Bogues, Larry Bird, Bill Murray (funny as he always is - definetely one of my fav comedians nowadays). The soundtrack is also great, especially R Kelly's I Believe I Can Fly. Amazing song.Well these are the good parts. What went wrong with the movie? Some of the scenes are just not funny. I was convinced i'll laugh alot, but i didn't, just because some gags don't work. They're either weak or they have been seen again. The voices of some cartoon characters are not the real ones, which is bad for the movie. And after all it's just a simple comedy.Definetely worth to watch, still can't give it more than a 6 out of 10.",Space Jam

Michael surprisingly acts decent, not Oscar-worthy mind you, but decent. The slamming soundtrack and cartoon antics just add to the fun.

105,K-Slicer,A Popcorn Flick...nothing more,7,13 July 2003,"I first saw this film upon release back seven years ago. It was good for a popcorn flick but not if you were looking for something with a little more psychological bite (like Fargo, released in the same year). Here are my reasons (spoilers herein): (1) I love the Looney Tunes and I will always be a fan of them no matter how inept and lame the next movie they make is. (2) Michael Jordan's performance is OK for a first attempt. (3) The special effects are well-done. (4) The entire sequence where the players try to figure out how they lost their talent almost had me on the floor laughing. (5) Charles Barkley uttered the line ""I'll never go out with Madonna again"" while praying to God is the single best adult-oriented line in the movie. (6) They couldn't resist taking a shot at Disney as well. (7) The best performance in the movie goes to Bill Murray.  He is relentless when he is on screen and it pays off.  Murray's cameo is one of his better roles pre-Rushmore and one of the best cameos of all time.  Seven reasons give a score of seven.As for the downsides: (1) Not much was given to plot development but there wasn't much to begin with in the first place. (2) Creepiest performance goes to Wayne Knight as Stan.  He was like Wormtail in the Harry Potter series. (3) Those little aliens are really annoying and whiny.  I prefer the villains to have a bit of a backbone even if they are puny.Overall, ""Space Jam"" is just another popcorn flick that is perfect to kill a weekend afternoon with.  Michael Jordan should stick to his day job which isn't ironically playing basketball anymore.  As for mixing cartoon characters and real-life characters into movies, thankfully these films are few and far between.  I suggest other titles like ""Rushmore"" and ""Fargo"" among others and this should be picked out as a last resort.Here ends my rant!",Space Jam

108,T-ZER0,"Face it, this movie sucks",2,8 April 2020,"Like Mr. T says: ""I pity the fool."" I pity the fools who think this is the epitome of Looney Tunes cinema. Most people grew up with this and I did too. I used to watch it whenever it came on TV, or on VHS. But it never appealed to me as much as Who Framed Roger Rabbit does. When does a plot with Looney Tunes and Basketball sound great? It doesn't. I agree with that one animator of Warner Bros. they made Bugs Bunny stupid. If he was smart, he could've gotten rid of the aliens in a few minutes. This isn't the Broken Arms hotel!When would Porky Pig say that he wet himself? How is that funny? Oh wait, it's funny if you are a kid. Which of course, most of the people who watched this were 6 year olds.Can we talk about how stupid a character Lola Bunny is? I've always hated her, and I have a good reason to. I've never ever been attracted to cartoon characters. Heck, I don't think Jessica Rabbit is attractive, but she's a lot better than Lola. They want you to think Lola is attractive, by giving her curves and crazy shots of her body and face, but she's hideous. She's not attractive, and she's my least favorite looney tune out of this whole franchise.I find it hilarious that the basketball game is terribly choreographed. Bugs Bunny is the point guard, yet he still lets Foghorn Leghorn skip down the court singing I wish I was in the land of cotton.What sense does it make to steal someone's talent? It literally makes no sense. Stealing superpowers is a thing. Stealing intelligence is one thing. But what the heck is stealing talent? Also, they literally shut down the NBA, just because a bunch of players claimed aliens took their talent? They wouldn't have them checked out by therapists? In real life they would think that they are doing drugs. Shutting down the NBA for Coronavirus is one thing, shutting it down because of some players claiming aliens were there is not. This is just lazy writing and it sucks bad.Also, besides the awfulness of the product placement, the only good thing to come out of this thing is the soundtrack, which my family used to listen to a lot. For you I will by Monica is the best song, but the movie is soo bad. I know Space Jam 2 is happening, but judging by this movie. It shouldn't. ""They are so occupied with whether or not they could they didn't stop to think if they should!""",Space Jam
109,moviemattb,Brings a lot memories back to my childhood,9,16 November 2014,"""Space Jam"" is one of those movies that is part of my childhood aside from the ""Star Wars"" movies; ""Who Framed Roger Rabbit?;"" ""The Wizard of Oz;"" and many other movies that I grew up with. Now, by looking back it today, it still holds up and it does bring a lot memories back to my childhood. However, is it up there with ""Who Framed Roger Rabbit?""? No. But I still think this is a fun movie for kids and adults to enjoy. ""Space Jam"" tells a story in a fictional way that Michael Jordan has retired from being a famous basketball player to become a baseball player like what his father want him to play. When the evil Swackhammer send his Nerdlucks to capture Bugs Bunny and the rest of the Looney Tunes to make them part of their attractions at an amusement park place called Moron Mountain. So Bugs and the rest of the gang decide to challenge them for playing basketball, the Nerdlucks stole Charles Barkley and the other famous NBA player's talents to become the Monstars which it all leads to the Looney Tunes to recruit Jordan to come back playing basketball and to beat the Monstars. I got to say that Michael Jordan's acting isn't that bad as what others say about him. I thought he did well as he is only playing himself, and playing natural as an everyday guy that plays sports and has a family on his own. So, in my opinion, I thought he did good job for not only playing himself, but able to do his own stunts when he is playing basketball. I don't have much thoughts on Wayne Knight's performance, but I thought he did fine. Bill Murray is also fun to watch as he is like Jordan playing himself. Forgot to mention, Danny DeVito was also fun for voicing Swackhammer. Billy West and Dee Bradley Baker both nail their voice acting really well for playing Bugs Bunny and Daffy Duck. Same goes to other voice actor. Although they are not on par with Mel Blanc, but they were able to remain true on what their voices are suppose to sound like. Of course I got to mention Lola Bunny, I thought she was a great addition to the other Looney Tunes; I know some others reacted negatively that they want her to be like what the Looney Tunes do, but I appreciate her from being different and I do think that she is a perfect love interest to Bugs Bunny. I never saw what ""The Looney Tunes Show"" did with her character differently, and not sure how I will feel about that. I thought the special effects in this movie are just as good as what ""Who Framed Roger Rabbit?"" did for its mixture of animation and live action. The basketball court is CGI, but it did not bothered me because I thought it kind of looks like an actual court if it was really there. The bad ones that I know are CG is the Monstars made Michael Jordan look like a basketball, and Wayne Knight's character to be inflated like a balloon until he returns back to his normal size. Aside from the bad ones, most of the special effects are really good. I thought the basketball scene in the last act of the movie is well done. James Newton Howard's score for the film is also well done as well as the film's soundtrack. I love Seal's ""Fly Like an Eagle;"" R.Kelly's ""I Believe I Can Fly;"" Quad City DJ's ""Space Jam"" theme song, and some others. Joe Pytka's direction in this movie was absolutely great, and I thought he handle the basketball scenes as he knows where to point the camera at and how it should be edit. On a side note, I like to mention that Ivan Reitman produce this movie, and Bill Murray makes a joke about how he got to the cartoon world where he mentions a producer that he is friends with and sent a Teamster to drop him off. Nothing important, but I had to bring that up in case if you didn't know about. Anyway, ""Space Jam"" is a fun movie and I still enjoy it! I give it a 9 out of 10.",Space Jam
110,Angels_Review,Space Jam,5,7 August 2014,"Well this was a really fun show to actually watch. I guess part of it was because of the fact that it had Michael Jordan in the show. I used the live in Chicago so the Chicago Bulls were a bit nostalgic for me. This has an interesting show because it had a lot of the same idea's as Cool World and Who framed Roger Rabbit. The whole idea that toons live in another dimension then the real world.When you look at the old looney tunes and the newer idea of them, a lot of things stand out. First, the personalities of the characters had actually been altered to make them a bit more rounded. Characters actually care for each other even though they still fight between themselves. One that seemed a bit forced though was the new character, Lola. She didn't have much story line and served as a love interest for Bugs as well as the only female in a mass of male characters.I love how they pretty much brought Michael's family life into it. It made it really relatable because we saw how he was just like everyone else. He has a loving wife, a couple beautiful kids, and a wonderful house with all that he really needed to be happy. He has friends as well (Although many of them are rather famous like Bill Murray.) and does many things that we would normally do. Unfortunately, Michael is many things, but not an actor. He is alright but he doesn't seem to show much emotion when it came to the tunes and destroy some of the emotions in it.One thing that bugged me was that in the start of the show, Michael has turned into a ball and thrown around by the Nerdlucks. There is a point at the end of the show that Michael actually asks if he can do toon physics to win the game. If he was turned into a ball and thrown around, wouldn't he know that he can? Not only that, but he never uses it except for those two times.The animation is rather good though the characters seem more 3D then they have any business being I think. It just feels a little out of what we are used to. It's not all bad, but does throw the show off when they go from old cartoons to the newer CG stuff. When cartoon physics kick in with the live action characters, it looks rather off as well, and you can actually tell that it was pretty strange photoshopping rather then CG. It's OK for the time I guess but it's still really easy to tell it's off.There really were no problems with the voices. They were really good and had the same feeling as the older version of the characters. The Nerdlucks were done well, each having there own personality and some stand out better then others.",Space Jam

112,japamo,"Looney Update of Hanna-Barbera's ""Harlem Globetrotters"" has the right ""Secret Stuff""",8,17 July 2012,"As some of you may recall, during the '70s on Saturday morning, Hanna-Barbera's ""Harlem Globetrotters"" would dribble onto the airwaves. Led by Meadowlark Lemon (voice of Scatman Crothers), and Granny, the team lived up to its name, traveling the world and taking on the weirdest, most unconventional, and often the most unscrupulous basketball teams - hillbillies, circus performers, surfers, bodybuilders, you name it. Each cartoon would climax with a wild basketball game that stomped all over NBA rules. In the first half, the Globetrotters would be handed their heads; in the second half, they always managed to get their groove together and trounce the opposing team.""Space Jam"" (hereafter SJ) is largely a Looney Tune, live-action-animation-mix update of those Globetrotter cartoons. Michael Jordan (wisely playing his rational composed self) is kidnapped from the natural world by Bugs and Daffy in a desperate bid to whip the seemingly hopeless Toon Squad into a viable basketball team against the intimidating Monstars. The Monstars were originally the miniscule minions (called Nerdlucks) of a ruthless cigar-chewing mobster type (voiced by Danny DeVito) ordered to shanghai the Looneys as enslaved entertainers for an amusement park called Moron Mountain on a distant planet. Bugs cons the little Nerdlucks into a basketball game, thinking it would be easy to defeat them and keep their freedom. But the Nerdlucks siphon off the basketball skills of NBA stars like Patrick Ewing and Charles Barkeley to become the Monstars. Uh-oh. Can Jordan (in the Meadowlark role) help the Looneys win? After the critical/popular triumph of ""Who Framed Roger Rabbit"", SJ at first glance appears to be a shabby, cynical rip-off using Jordan's (and Bugs's) starpower to make a quick profit. While not quite up there technically or thematically with ""Roger Rabbit"", SJ is quite diverting, funny, and even bitingly satirical in its own right. Even before the wacky basketball game begins, SJ sustains riffs on athletic fame, greedy sports franchises, athletes' moral behavior, and even Jordan himself, especially his ill-advised foray into baseball. All the Looney Tunes, from Marvin the Martian to Bugs (to even lesser-known 'toons like Sniffles the mouse), get their chance to be sharply humorous. The human co-stars, including Wayne Knight and Bill Murray (""I didn't know Dan Ackroyd was in this picture!"") as Toon Squad substitutes, acquit themselves well with their limited screen time. The game itself, free-wheeling as it is, is actually quite exciting and well-executed as Jordan interacts with the multi-colored Monstars.SJ even has some moral uplift. Predictably, the Toon Squad is literally being crushed by their brutal opponents during the first half. Even Jordan's pep talk is futile; it puts the Looneys to sleep. Bugs comes to the rescue with some ""Jordan's Secret Stuff"", a liquid that puts fire back into the team. Later, as the ""Secret Stuff"" is used up, the 'toons learn that it was really just water, and that they had the ability to play the game all along (take that, Dumbo!). But the game is at the wire, with the Squad down by one point. Can Jordan make the winning basket? Maybe, if he can channel his inner Toon (now Bugs tells him!).SJ is surprisingly satisfying entertainment that makes the extra effort to ensure that Looney Tunes, Jordan, and basketball aficionados -and even many of the rest of us- have a good time.",Space Jam
113,theteamavengers,loved it,9,28 August 2020,"I never saw it as a kid and now i'm 14 and i'm gonna say that this movie was enjoyable and very entertaining. characters are memorable. MJ the goat, was awesome, as always. Loony tunes were great. it's fun, entertaining and has many scenes that will stuck in your head forever. As a MJ and basketball fan, i loved this movie",Space Jam
114,byson5186,Fun/Entertaining,9,20 June 2015,"This is one of the movies I would watch as a kid. It seems like a lot of the people on these IMDb message boards and reviews for this movie Space Jam are around the same age I am and remember watching this movie when we were younger. My parents still have this movie on VHS, and I remember giving it to my older sister for her 17th Birthday, but I don't think she ever really watched it, or maybe once. Whenever I watch this movie, it's a trip down Memory Lane. I still remember it pretty well from when the movie was new and when I was a kid watching it on VHS.Here is what makes this movie interesting. Well, there are lots of sports movies including certain sports movies for kids. From what the internet tells us, this movie is still the highest grossing basketball movie to date, and keep in mind this movie is almost 20-years old. In this movie, we get to see real basketball players who play themselves. Obviously, the main one Michael Jordan. We also have Charles Barkley, Patrick Ewing, Mugsy Bogues, Larry Johnson, and Shawn Bradley. We also have Bill Murray in this movie who plays a character with the same name, but not supposed to be the same person.What makes this movie entertaining. Well, Michael Jordan was talked about more in the '90s. He doesn't seem talked about so much anymore. But, I think that was nice of him to star in a fun entertaining movie where the target audience was kids. Kids being able to see their hero in an entertaining 1.5 hour movie. This movie wasn't a documentary featuring him or a movie about his life, but a movie for entertainment. Yeah, it's a movie featuring Michael Jordan and the Looney Tunes. We've all seen the Looney Tunes cartoons, Merry Melodies and those cartoons are from decades ago, but we still remember the characters and the sound effects including the sound effects where a character like Wile. E. Coyote falls off a cliff. That sound effect sounds like a bomb being dropped from a military plane. It's just cool seeing a plot involving Michael Jordan and the Looney Tunes, and the movie will definitely keep us entertained and our eyes on the screen.So, I enjoy watching this movie. It still entertains me as an adult. With sports movies that have been made and ones that will be eventually make for kids, we can ask which one will come out next? I believe there is a Space Jam 2 in the works. But, if they could make a certain sports movie for kids, this is one I'd love to see becoming a film even though I doubt it will become one. The funniest book I've read in my entire life is a 1993 book called, The Toilet Paper Tigers by Gordon Korman. I crack up while reading it and in terms of reading I'd recommend it for you if you like reading. With coming up with new ideas for sports films, that would be awesome if they did a well done version of that book into a movie.To conclude, if you want to relive your childhood days, or the days when Michael Jordan was a bigger athlete, you can watch this film. You most likely will consider it Fun/Entertaining!!",Space Jam
115,valen060,A 1996 Family Classic That Holds Up Well To This Day,9,20 July 2021,"I was a kid in grade school when this movie first came out on Nov. 15th, 1996. I still remembered how excited I was wanting to see Bugs Bunny and fellow Tunes teaming up with NBA legend Michael Jordan against alien forces challenging them to a game of basketball. Essentially, it's like paying two for the price of one movie if you catch my meaning. It also marked the debut of female bunny Lola as an avid team player that won the heart of Bugs himself and countless other fans with her skills.The Looney Tunes have had numerous cartoon shorts for decades that showed off their whimsical, fourth wall-breaking, meta humor. So to utilize all of that into a live-action/animated sports adventure comedy was cutting edge in technology at the time with the animation sequences blending seamlessly well in either a live-action environment or a live character in an animated world. It worked for Who Framed Roger Rabbit and it's likely the filmmakers used that movie as an influence to crafting this production.Without a doubt it's a movie that I still hold dear with its talented cast in the likes of Jordan (not bad for a non-actor), featuring comedians Wayne Knight and Bill Murray. They've all done their part and performed with such ease. And its music soundtrack is also mesmerizing. Whether you're familiar with Jordan's b-ball playing prowess or how much you've tuned in to Looney Tunes growing up on TV, today's audiences should check this out if they haven't already.",Space Jam
116,TheMysteriousReviewer,A Looney Basketball Film,8,19 July 2021,"Space Jam is actually an enjoyable film that adapts Looney Tunes well. I'll admit the characters need to work on their development and the basketball story may sound generic at first. But it can still be a fun film thanks to great mix of live action and animation, nice charm from Looney Tunes and some good additions to Looney Tunes like it wants to give Bugs Bunny a girlfriend. Of course, this is worth a watch for those that are like me and grew up with Looney Tunes. But I would mostly recommend this if you're a basketball fan. This movie can also have fun moments with Michael Jordan. It may not be that big of looney, but it's enjoyable for what it is.",Space Jam
117,quiqueperezsoler,Best 90s cartoon-live action meta time capsule that stands the test of time,9,17 July 2021,"What was meant as a silly, light-hearted and charming 90s-backdropped basketball-fever aimed primarily at kids; with time became one of the most beloved and popular cartoon-live action movies ever made.The reasons?LOONEY TUNES AT THEIR BEST -Beyond the fact that these cartoons are not as famous today as they once were, so technically the childhood nostalgia factor may influence the excitement of the now adult kids that once were. The movie renders the classical cartoons perfectly. From the meta references and 4th wall breaking of instances like when the looney tunes themselves acknowledge they are cartoons that appear on TV and are run by Warner Bros. Directives; to the fact that every ounce of dialogue serves not only the plot itself and is not wasted in easy comedy bits but also stay true to the humor and nature that each individual character has (i.e. The coyote dropping the weight after the intermission, Sylvester proposing the capturing of tweety which has nothing to do with the actual plan-suggesting brainstorm).THE PLOT, LESS LOONEY THAN IT LOOKS - From initial premise to actual small sports references and subplots that provide for it. From noticing their to-be captors are short and in order to defend themselves they propose to play a basketball game hoping to defeat them; to the fact that they decide to obtain the powers from other famous basketball players and not as much as a gimmick but to also provide a round plot by providing glimpses into the ""new lives"" of these talent-less players. Also the fact that Michael doesn't get targeted because he JUST retired, all the ""excuses"" the movie comes up for all the plot elements to tie in and develop somehow have a reason behind that doesn't feel forced just to move the pieces until where they should be. The movie ends up being predictable but reasonably developed. The incurssion of the Looney Tunes conflict into the real world that triggers the talent robbery and subsequent change in the status quo of the sports arena is also proof of the depth and well-realised script the movie has. Not only because it uses this resolve to provide the bad guys with the ""necessary talent"" (rather than a natural but unlikely talent for it) to play the sport but it also provides the ""solution"" to balance the scale through Bug's ""MJ super secret water"" that is just as ludicrous and looney that actually fits in the psycological profile of these charactersTHE HUMOR: LOONEY AND CARTOONEY - As spot-on then when I watched as a kid as when rewatching it as an adult. Making use not only of the physical humor characteristic of the Looney Tunes but also, when scrutinised with adult and objective eyes, the comedic timing and dialogue resulting in witty, quippy and hilarious sequences and exchanges. Enhanced only by its interaction with the ""live action world"" where the cartoon nature of these come into play for not only fun comedic moments but important plot points like Michael's stretching air Jordan moment which plays with the amazing world-building of ""looney land"" where even 3D-live-action people can do cartoon prowesses.The hilarious premise that a group of loony, ADHDed and hyperactive cartoons would be the worst sort of characters to teach any sort of discipline. And again, the meta-jokes, like the ass-kissing to WarnerBros or the ""we don't see any money from the toy merch or lunch box merch"" to the references to other studios like ""what sort of mickey mouse organisation would call their team The Ducks"" hinting at a meta reference to Disney's Mighty Ducks movie.2D to 3D - While the effects might have aged a bit poorly, there's no doubt they were groundbreaking at the time (at least for most audiences), having seen them only in movies like ""Who framed roger rabbit"" and a few others. So every scene where both meet, particularly Michael meeting the looney tunes and when they have to go get MJ's gear, making the perfect use of practical 2D elements like shadow silhouettes so as to not rely on the unnatural merging of 2D animation and 3D live action. Additionally, the potential unleashed of allowing more than our main character to break the 2D barrier for ""convenience"" and allowing others like Stan and Bill Murray to participate too. It shows good world-building by making it a ""two-way street"" with tons of potential for other future interactions...MICHAEL JORDAN AND THE 90s - There's no denying, even though he doesn't provide an oscar-worthy acting, that he does a very decent job throughout and they never pretend he is something different like they had in other sport-cellebrity-featuring movies like Shazam?. He is a basketball player, and the ""looney"" way they get him to return to the sport is as overthetop as it is creative and, today, very nostalgic. AS both Looney Tunes and the entire basketball backdrop of the 90s provides the perfect window into traditional 2D animation and a unique feel of basketball 90s nostalgia of kid-oriented morally-uplifting movies. The music, shots, dialogue, the basketball humour (from hitting their heads cuz they tall, and other HUMOR: the fact no other players understand their story, players praying, therapy and the fortune teller nailing every plot thing and the players not believing them)Little details that make the story more than just a seemingly ""cashgrab"" - The fact that the monstars aren't all that bad, or not all of them are all cliched evil. The fact that Michael Takes some convincing to get him on board with returning to basketball , that he doesn't just do it for the sake of the plot.THE BASKETBALL GAME - Despite it has no montage of the squad actually trying to learn and improve basketball, the movie does a great job of focusing less on the ""realistic sport-leveling of both teams"" and decides to run with the fun of it by providing one of the craziest cartoon-liveaction hybrid matches (next to Dorknobs and broomsticks football game) in history so far. Enhanced only by providing each player's unique presentation and playing style during the game itself. Providing, of course the necessary humour that follows all the actions of these characters as humour is the only thing they know how to do, and we love them for itCONS:
THE EFFECTS BLENDINGE - limited by the time but when others (like James Cameron, George Lucas and Steven Spielbierg) have accomplished so much with a budget for it. A budget that should have been invested by the production company when making the movie given the 2D/3D live action blend was an essential aspect of the film.HUMAN ACTING - even of known actors like Bill Murray and Wayne Knight, we have seem them at their best and in this film they just decided to have fun with the silly premise and nature of the film. Which is fine but does show a contrasting difference between the spot-on over the top voice-acting of the Looney Tunes with the, at times, ""unexciting"" reaction and line delivery of the humans who are sucked into this caricaturized world. But for sport cellebrities, they did a decent job, thanks mostly to the hilarious and well-written screenplay.FRONT AND CENTER - With the ""glorification of a certain someone"" and the focus being entirely on one person which, in principle isn't the problem, but rather the focus on the world reaction to that person. For instance, by having not one perfect intro of the cellebrity but more than 1 that feel in the end a bit ""on the nose"". The best way to represent a cellebrity playing as themselves is by being humble about it. We don't need to be reminded how great Michael Jordan is, we know and we cheer for him because of it. There's no need to put him in a pedestal in a blockbuster movie featuring more ""cellebrities"" or well-known movie presences (like Looney Tunes and others). And also the very very ending of the film, after he gives back the power to the other depressed NBA players he returns to basketball after all... Bit of a cliche ending in what could otherwise had been his ""goodbye"" from Basketball in the big screen.LOLA BUNNY AND THE DEATH OF THE ""FEMME FATALE"" CHARACTER - There is a difference between over-sexualization and the classic ""femme fatale"" female character. While in the case of our Lola Bunny, the role was not particularly following the lines of that particular archetype, it did use it as an ""angle"" to which present what could actually may have been ignored: strong independent female character. Certainly it was the 90s, and there was a sexualization process, but her role and the other few female presences that appear, although briefly, in the movie did represent competent and independent female characters. Like the girls playing on the street when Barkley walks by. In today's feminist spectrum in hollywood, and not counting the perhaps border-line sexualization of Lola, there's some good female representations here with strong, independent women that can fend for themselves in the basketball court.",Space Jam
118,dudeguy-29536,I finally figured out why this movie has so many mixed reviews,7,11 June 2021,"I've been wondering why I've seen so many people love and hate Space Jam. I watched this movie (again) just to see what is going on with the whole controversy here.So before I break this movie down, I want to talk about some previous media between Bugs Bunny and the Looney Tunes gang. Looney Tunes have been known for their hilarious golden age cartoons since 1930 with Bugs Bunny, Daffy Duck, Porky Pig, Wil E Coyote, Road Runner, Foghorn Leghorn, Sylvester, Tweety, Granny, Marvin, Pepé Lepew, Speedy Gonzales, Taz, and several more here and there. They are basically the start of classic cartoon gags and humor along with Walt Disney's original cartoons. Looney Tunes never had an actual ""movie"" until this came out. After all the golden age Looney Tunes cartoons ending around the 60s, they made several anthology television shows putting all the classic cartoons together for television reruns like The Bugs Bunny Show, The Sylvester and Tweety Show, The Bugs and Daffy Show, and like so much more as the years continued replaying these cartoons every day on the television networks. And personally that worked well. But then by the late 70s they started making Looney Tunes movies but unfortunately they were not movies. They were just anthology films that were theatrically released where the people at Warner Bros recycle certain Looney Tunes cartoons into a full feature length film with very little newly animated footage. And I personally didn't see the point of those even for its time knowing all those cartoons were already reruns on television for the past 20+ years. But anyway, by the early 90s there were a few expensively animated commercials of Looney Tunes with Michael Jordan advertising the new Jordan shoes everyone loved back then, and even to this day if I'm not wrong. So because the commercials were so popular, Warner Bros for some reason decided to make it a whole movie and with the Looney Tunes all together in full movie footage.This is basically the Looney Tunes movie, but not exactly ""Looney Tunes"" in every second of the production. It's also about Michael Jordan and his basketball career. This movie's plot is simply Michael Jordan decides to retire from basketball and to continue his sports career playing baseball like his dad wanted. Meanwhile in outer space there's a planet where the monstars live who are losing business at their fair and find out about the Looney Tunes who can take over. They steal Michael's friend's powers and hold the Looney Tunes hostage to make them their slaves for entertainment and decide to compete in a basketball game to make them go or not. Because they can't play basketball very well, they find Michael Jordan and bring him to their universe from the center of earth. They all come together and practice while Bill Murray and Stan search for him back in ""3D land"". Eventually they go to the basketball tournament to make their final play-off between the Monstars and the Toon Squad. And then at the end with enough heart for the game, the Toon Squad wins and defeats the monstars and give back Jordan's friend's sports strength. Jordan then returns back to his world at the baseball game with the heart he needed from basketball.So my thoughts on the plot personally can understand why this is loved and hated. Personally to me, it's okay. Not very good but not very bad either. The story is definitely weird. But what keeps the story from being hated by everybody is the fact that this movie does provide some of the Looney Tunes humor and that it also has a simply good message even if you're not a fan of basketball. And for any people who like both, sports and Looney Tunes, will basically find this to be their dream movie seeing it as a crossover.So the positives of the writing in this movie isn't much honestly but it's nothing to really get angry about. Because another thing, a Looney Tunes movie is kind of impossible to pull off (which probably explains the 5-6 anthology movies they made beforehand). There really wasn't much at all to work with in the making of this film in the whole process of writing. Looney Tunes were mainly known for their classic cartoonish humor for the simplest jokes that can be produced over and over. And every cartoon focused on usually one to five characters at the most. So when making a theatrical movie that's actually a ""movie"", all the writers were forced to include every single Looney Tunes character (including the side characters you wouldn't see very often) into an hour and a half running time in some kind of movie story. But of course, they also decided to include the plot with Michael Jordan which I admit is a lot less necessary when it could've just been a movie about an adventure with only the Looney Tunes in their own universe. So yeah, the idea of this movie is definitely unnecessary. This is basically what started all the live-action animation hybrid films that don't do well with the live-action, but it has some executions. As I said, most of the Looney Tunes characters are still in character and have their cartoonish moments, the monstars actually aren't so bad for this movie, the final scene goes on for a while but it gives some pleasure to how Looney the Looney Tunes really are to win in a basketball tournament, and there is a message basically saying that you are capable of doing anything if you try and to not give up. I think the message works well enough especially for kids who watch this movie. The one thing I really didn't understand however was the fact the Looney Tunes universe was literally at the center of the earth, like didn't Who Framed Roger Rabbit explain a place called ToonTown? And of course Lola Bunny basically being the new Looney Tunes character that originally wasn't supposed to appear in any future media after this movie if I'm correct. Lola Bunny is alright here, I'm not a weirdo like many viewers that think she's so ""hot"" or whatever, her and Bugs are cute together, and that's all that matters.Now let's talk about the animation. If you don't know this of course the second live-action animation hybrid feature film off of Warner Bros characters, the first was in Who Framed Roger Rabbit. But here, I actually was surprised at how well animated everything is. The animation is super-theatrically done here and actually improves the animation from Roger Rabbit with more 3D shading and effects like never before! The backgrounds in the Looney Tunes world look so 3D with all the characters. The monstars planet was made in CGI with all the monstars characters in hand-drawn form and it actually feels like the highest animation budget from the 90s all together! The animators definitely deserve credit, the Looney Tunes are captured very bouncy and cartoony everywhere they are in the most mind-blowing animation I've ever seen honestly. For the 90s this animation is actually quite remarkable.Now for all the acting in this movie. So first of all, the entire voice cast of the Looney Tunes and the monstars are all on-point. I was surprised Jeff Bergman wasn't here to do Bugs however, instead we had Billy West. But he actually sounds pretty good for the role! Dee Bradley Baker also voiced Daffy surprisingly and Kath Soucie was the voice of Lola Bunny. So anyway, now for the live-action actors, this like many others, I wasn't a fan of at all. Michael Jordan, Bill Murray, and Wayne Knight are okay at acting, I actually like how Michael Jordan is normally chill even when he meets cartoons for the first time because I mean, he's Michael Jordan guys. They didn't need much more out of him. The rest of the cast other than the boy who played 10-year old Michael from 23 years earlier don't do very good here. I felt like mostly Michael's friends and even his kids in this movie didn't really know what they were doing. Why aren't his kids excited when they meet Bugs and Daffy in the middle of the night? And also why is Bill and Stan not freaked out by the fact Michael was sucked into the golf hole? And why is everyone else in this movie feel so boring? I mean I basically ignored a bit of the live-action scenes with Michael's friends doing stuff but the acting definitely could've been worked on with them. There's even a dog in this movie that's lowkey green-screened for some reason. I don't know why. But I guess everyone in this movie is just too aware that the cartoon characters have been living underground and are very used to them like it wasn't the first time they've met them before.The soundtrack is actually fun, we get a whole soundtrack that executes the movie's score with exciting songs like ""I Believe I Can Fly"" ""Fly Like An Eagle"" and even the Space Jam theme provided in the beginning made this feel a lot more fun and well executed in a strange way. And I really love Seal's cover of Fly Like An Eagle it sounds like a 90's update of the original by Steve Miller Band.So I figured out the whole controversy, some fans say that it's basically not very Looney being just a complete overhyped cashgrab, and some say that it's a childhood gem. In my opinion, Space Jam is a strange and very imperfect movie with Michael Jordan and the Looney Tunes, but it's not as bad as many critics have said it is. Just note that it's atleast a Looney Tunes movie that has not-so-good acting, a strange sports crossover, and not your average Looney Tunes feature length adventure, but it also isn't just stitching recycled Looney Tunes together that we've seen so many times, it's even providing some interesting humor, and some groundbreakingly fluid animation you'll probably never see again. And if you like basketball, then this movie is even better for you.",Space Jam
119,crowrobot,"Not terrible, just... underwhelming",4,24 May 2005,"It's really hard to comment on a movie like ""Space Jam"". Most people trash it because it is untrue to the tradition of Looney Tunes. I agree with this; I groan at the inclusion of Lola Bunny, and Bugs and costars would NOT need Michael Jordan's help in defeating these Monstars. The only thing that can kill them is Dip, for crying out loud. Nevertheless, the film has it's charms (though they are few). One cannot review 'Space Jam' without mentioning Michael Jordan. I wouldn't mind the movie so much if it didn't center around Jordan worship. Here's an idea: Why not have a real actor play a fictional basketball player? A legend out of their prime, called out again in a time of need for the Looney Tunes. Doesn't that seem like a good premise? Apparently, Warner Bros. didn't think so, and much of the film has gallons of praise for Jordan. Michael Jordan is not a bad actor per se, but he really is just being himself. The Looney Tunes are still funny, but their personalities do not seem as apparent in this movie. I mean, when you get down to it, the personalities of the Looney Tunes is what makes them funny. Here, they just seem... like cookie-cutter cartoon characters. That ain't good. Bill Murray shows up to inject some much-needed laughs in the final act, and he seems more adept at acting alongside 'Toons than Michael Jordan. Ultimately, Space Jam's problem is that it falls flat. It's dead in the water. 'Space Jam' is a disappointment.",Space Jam

122,CrazyCockatoo2003,One of the best cartoon live action adaptations there is.,7,16 July 2021,"Space Jam is one of those movies where many people have a lot of nostalgia for it. Until now, I never recalled seeing it in my life, despite hearing so much about how great it is, and personally, it deserved all the praise it got.What gives off the sense of nostalgia in this movie to many is, its memorable opening scene. Followed by a great soundtrack, excellent animation, and plenty of well placed references to the original Looney Tunes shorts, making it faithful to the source material compared to most other hybrid adaptations. It even has good acting and voice acting from almost the whole cast, and most of the jokes are well thought out. The villains are actually threatening. The returning characters are still likable. It introduced the character Lola Bunny, who would later be a staple of the franchise since then. The cartoon characters blend into the real world exceptionally well, in fact, as well as Roger Rabbit. It has plenty of room to throw in every Looney Tunes character there is, and to top it all off, the story is well paced.However, it is not complete without its flaws that some hardcore fanatics tend to ignore, is that for one, the opening credits is seizure inducing. Also, the 3D animated bits such as the spaceships may look dated by today's standards. I've even heard that Michael Jordan's acting is not particularly good this time around. There's even a sentence said by one of the characters in this movie that's chuck full of product placement, which must explain part of why some people were calling this entire movie a 90 minute ad. Also, the green screening looks a bit off. There are too many close-up shots. Lola, in this movie, had nothing more to her character than be the love interest of Bugs, and an experienced basketball player at that. Finally, the toilet humor is tasteless.Overall, I thought it was good, in fact, it was one of the best live action/animated movie adaptations of a cartoon there currently is due to its faithfulness to the source material. Definitely give this one a watch if you are a Looney Tunes fan.",Space Jam

124,Blazehgehg,An extremely simple movie,5,1 September 2021,"Being 13 years old in 1996, Space Jam was basically targeted specifically at me and my friends. It was a movie I genuinely loved. I remember a specific instance of sitting down to rewatch Space Jam with a cousin, effectively parroting every line of dialog in the movie as it played, and eventually she got tired of my stupidity and shouted ""I've never seen this before, and you're ruining it!""Tremendously embarrassing? Yes. But hey, that's what being 13 is like sometimes. And it serves to communicate just how well I knew this movie.When I sat down to rewatch Space Jam as an adult, it had probably been close to 20 years since the last time I saw this movie. Long enough for memories to fade and become lost. I could remember a few key storyline details and a small handful of scenes, but expected there to be a lot of stuff in between those moments I had forgotten.As it turns out? Not really. In the roughly two decades since the last time I saw Space Jam, my memory had actually remained relatively clear. The problem is more the fact that Space Jam is paper thin. The plot can be summed up as:The Looney Tunes need help playing a basketball game, so they ask the legendary Michael Jordan, and then Michael Jordan wins the game for them.That's it. That's all of Space Jam. I just spoiled the whole movie for you. Yes, there's a little more to it than that, but not as much as you'd think. As scary as the Monstars may be, if you've seen enough Looney Tunes cartoons, you know they're simply too stupid to win. Bugs Bunny always humiliates his opponents with some kind of witty or absurd technicality, and Space Jam does absolutely nothing to shake that foundation. There's never any doubt that the Tunes are always in control of the punchline.The most interesting part of Space Jam nowadays is the animation. Warner was trying hard to show off some genuinely impressive digital artwork in Space Jam. There's a scene later in the movie where Bugs and Daffy have to enter the real world, and it feels like they very specifically set it at night just so they could paint these beautiful shadows on the characters as they move between sources of light. Not all the animation is quite that good, but they were definitely looking for places to flex their artistic muscles.Also of particular curiosity are the crowd shots. On an old VHS, I imagine a lot of the background characters filling stadium seats were impossible to see, but with the advent of high-definition remasters, their full detail can finally be witnessed. From a technical standpoint, it's fascinating and bizarre -- like looking at an old video game, complete with weirdly blurry textures, flat bodies, and choppy animation.Does any of that make Space Jam a good movie? No! Goodness, no. But neither is it awful, I guess. It's just... vapid. Empty. Simple, if we're being polite. Tolerable, let's say. But barely an excuse for the Looney Tunes to get out and do something looney.",Space Jam

137,Herbest8,Pretty good,5,25 April 2010,"This movie has received a lot of flak over the last couple of years and I honestly don't know why. OK, it's not terrific or a masterpiece, but it does accomplish one simple goal: it's entertaining.The plot concerns Michael Jordan (playing himself and proving to be a rather charming actor) who, after retiring from basketball, finds himself roped (literally) into helping Bugs Bunny and the Looney Tunes in a do or die game against aliens. Sound ridiculous? It is but this is the Looney Tunes, not ""2001.""The pros are pretty significant. The cast performs well (with Wayne Knight and Bill Murray stand-outs), the animation is colorful and lively and the comedy concerning the now-talentless NBA players is really a treat with a particular shout-out going to Albert Hague who plays a psychiatrist. Let's also mention the phenomenal soundtrack which I will never fault this film for.Although it lacks solidity and most of the live action scenes without the Tunes are pretty dull, overall I enjoyed it. And I still do almost fourteen years later.",Space Jam
138,CalvinValjean,A Looney Corporate Product,7,24 August 2017,"My review of SPACE JAM has always been the same: if you go into this expecting the definitive cinematic adaptation of the classic LOONEY TUNES shorts and everything that made them great, especially the work of the great Chuck Jones, you will be disappointed. But if you go into this accepting it for what it is, a family-themed sports-fantasy movie that just happens to feature the LOONEY TUNES characters in it, then you'll be adequately satisfied. This isn't a great movie, but it does give you exactly what you pay for.The movie is directed by Joe Pytka, who'd mostly directed music videos and commercials, including several Super Bowl TV spots (which, pre-YouTube, was considered the golden timeslot for the highest quality commercials you'd see all year). And that's exactly what this movie really is: one feature-length commercial. A commercial for LOONEY TUNES, the NBA, and hip hop music, all rolled up into one movie filled with corporate logos.The plot: aliens invade and threaten to enslave the LOONEY TUNES characters and make them attractions on their planet's theme park. So Bugs, Daffy, Porky, and the gang must come up with a plan and eventually decide to...challenge the aliens to a basketball game? Really? As pretty much every critic pointed out, these are characters known for such zany hijinks and slapstick-filled adventures that break the laws of physics. That they would pick something as mundane as a basketball game feels out of character. Chuck Jones disliked the movie and said his version of Bugs Bunny would have outsmarted the aliens in about seven minutes and not needed anyone's help to do so.The movie is aware that it has a flimsy premise, but it needs it in order for the gimmick to happen: Bugs has to recruit Michael Jordan from our world to help the gang. Jordan coaches our heroes and they play in the big game, filled with CGI and-then groundbreaking FX. He has a dorky sidekick Stan (Wayne Knight) and a surprise ally in Bill Murray. Murray is actually the best thing in the movie, as his trademark ad-libbed, wink at the audience, ""What the hell am I doing in this movie?"" schtick plays well in a movie this self-aware.The live-action portions of the movie are its weakest element. Which is a shame as there's some good acting by Jordan, Knight, Murray, and cameos by other NBA players (Charles Barkley and Larry Bird), as well as Patricia Heaton and Dan Castellaneta. But they are blandly- directed and feel like a collection of sketches with lame jokes, basically what you would expect from a director of commercials working with a cast of mostly athletes with little acting experience. And get ready to see tons of basketball-playing footage and shot-after- fetishistic-shot of baskets being dunked and Jordan making every jumpshot in slow-motion with graceful precision; in other words, what you've seen in countless athletic commercials before.The animated portions of the movie are much stronger, featuring more colorful visuals, fun cutaway gags, and the usual mayhem and slapstick we've come to expect from these characters. Bugs Bunny is voiced by Billy West, and while he can never measure up to the legendary Mel Blanc, he does a great job giving us more or less what we expect this iconic prankster to be. Daffy, Porky, Tweety, Sylvester, Taz and Elmer are all there as well and each one manages to get in a few of their classic quips and gags. None of it ever lives up to the humor of the classic shorts of Chuck Jones and his contemporaries, but it generally works.It's hard to explain what a sensation this movie was at the time. To any kid growing up in the early '90's, Michael Jordan was a God. He was the biggest athlete in the world who appeared in countless commercials and, while maybe not a professional actor, definitely had charisma and screen presence that matched his family-friendly persona. Even if you were a kid who didn't follow sports (like me), you heard about Michael Jordan on a daily basis: I still remember the entire school talking when this mythic figure announced he was leaving basketball to attempt a career in baseball, and his eventual return to basketball. I would argue there hasn't been a professional athlete since who has had the global popularity Jordan had in his prime. If you were a studio exec in 1996 and had to greenlight a film to serve as a starring vehicle for Jordan, having him act opposite a bunch of cartoon characters was probably the best option.And on that note, everything about SPACE JAM is very mid-'90's: the hip hop soundtrack, the aggressive sense of humor, the attempts to give the cartoon characters edgy dialog and a ""hip"" attitude, the emphasis on athleticism and cast consisting mostly of NBA all-stars, and the pop culture references, right down to PULP FICTION.SPACE JAM is junk food, filled with corporate logos, created for the sake of making money. But as a piece of nostalgia intended for kids, it's harmless fun. What else can I say but: that's all, folks!",Space Jam

I'm sure that Michael Jordan enjoyed star billing, but as is usually the case when your co-star is a cartoon rabbit with more than 50 years of experience behind him (and one of the best catch phrases in cinema), he is up-staged by Bugs Bunny.  Oh, not to say that Jordan turned in a poor performance.  Thank goodness this guy at least seems to have a good sense of humor.But there's some simple, pure enjoyment in watching this film.  I got a kick out of the big basketball game, and found the sequence with Bugs and Daffy retrieving Michael's lucky boxers to be a riot.  Yea, the plot is pretty hare-brained ('scuse me, Bugs...duck-brained;D), but it's nothing unworthy of Looney Tunes.  Don't ever forget that-this is a Looney Tunes film.  They got away with using anything for a plot, and this movie is in the same tradition.  It's like asking a movie about Beavis and Butthead to be artful and dramatic.

154,aka-45316,"DON'T Let This Movie's Significantly Large Fanbase Fool You, ""Space Jam"" is ALL Sorts of Terrible",1,23 September 2021,"Ladies and gentleman, I'll come clean about this:Coming from a guy who still remembers his time watching this movie around last year, I found ""Space Jam"" to be an uneventful stinker that hardly put a smile on my face, even as a Looney Tunes film. Even today, I get a headache just thinking about this dung heap.For instance, the character development in articulation was hugely lacking, mainly because none of the characters had any kind of growth throughout the film and were rather bland. To top it all off, the human-visible cast members looked like they'd rather be doing something else more than be on the screen, especially that of Michael Jordan. The voices of the Looney Tunes and the Mon-Stars sounded kinda annoying, if I may add. A definite example came from Billy West's portrayal of Bugs Bunny, which hardly sounded anywhere close to the late Mel Blanc's portrayal of the character and was extremely squeaky.On the subject of the film's main antagonist, Swackhammer...I never really cared for him at all. He was basically one of the most bland and forgettable villains I've ever seen. He was nothing but a one-dimensional theme park owner who had little in the ways of a personality, development, or sense of humor. His lack of ultimate motivations other than to find a way to keep his park going did not help in making him more compelling whatsoever, and the fact that he wanted to enslave the Looney Tunes just to ""improve"" his theme park was likewise not only ridiculous but extremely stupid. In addition to this, Danny DeVito's talents were clearly wasted thanks to getting cast as the character. Along with his performance lacking personality and humor compared to much of his other work, DeVito sounded as if he was openly restrained.Likewise, the Mon-Stars/Nerdlucks were less-than-memorable additions, and the reasons behind that are pretty much the same as Swackhammer. Even when they absorbed the talents of the other basketball players featured in the film, they were nothing but irritating and idiotic cardboards who lacked personality and depth.The hand-drawn animation and CGI weren't the most eye-catching either, really.I get that this movie was made in the late 1990s, but come on! For a film of that time period, the special effects used with things like Moron Mountain and the spaceships looked extremely cheesy, especially to where you could tell it was all done by computer. Along with that, the hand-drawn animation seemed to have a vibe saying that the animators were hardly putting any dedication into their work, even in making sure it blended well with the live-action settings and elements.Finally, the direction by Joe Pytka, and the story by Leo Benevuti, Steve Rudnick, Timothy Harris, and Herschel Weingard were hardly what I'd like to call award-worthy.The comedy that was featured wasn't very laughable, as the jokes often fell flat and were awfully cringy despite the film trying to be funny. Likewise, I couldn't help but note that the film was lacking a sense of heart and soul, with little emotional connection between the characters or morals for the characters and audiences to live by. The overall concept had also been so confusing I could hardly understand or get it, which is why I couldn't give a summary of this film before analyzing it. To put it bluntly, the story is not as simple or understandable as people make it sound due to many of the aspects the film contained.In the end, ""Space Jam"" was FAR from fun. Everything about it seemed like a mindless cash-grab by Warner Bros. Just to make money off of Michael Jordan and the Looney Tunes being in one film, and the way it played out was like it wasn't made by people at all.",Space Jam

156,CartoonKing2,A movie-length commercial and nothing more.,3,24 September 2011,"""Space Jam"" is an animation/live-action hybrid starring NBA superstar Michael Jordan and the greatest cartoon characters of all time, the Looney Tunes.The plot of the movie is: Mister Swackhammer wants a new attraction for his alien theme park ""Moron Mountain"". He chooses the Looney Tunes, and sends his minions the nerdlucks to earth so they can capture them. The nerdlucks change into giant monsters and kick the Looney Tunes's butts in basketball, so Bugs Bunny and the gang find Michael Jordan to help them.Due to Michael Jordan's HUGE popularity in the '90s, there was obviously a lot of hype surrounding this movie when it came out back in 1996, but just because it has big names doesn't mean it's a good movie, and that is the case with ""Space Jam"". This movie is pretty much an insult to Looney Tunes and the Looney Tunes fans. For one thing this movie introduces Lola Bunny. A pointless character whose only purpose in the franchise is to give Bugs a love interest. Also instead of the physical comedy and battles of wits that made these characters famous, we get overly violent, crude and mean-spirited humor.Other flaws include Jordan's uninspired and overall boring acting performance, the obnoxious and irritating characters that are the nerdlucks, and for the film being just a giant advertisement for Michael Jordan and all of his sponsors.The only good things about this movie are the animation and the voice acting, which are both outstanding, and there a few mildly funny jokes here and there, but overall this movie sucks.Not recommended for hard-core Looney Tunes fans, or people who have been exposed to some actually well made animated movies. If you want to see a good animation/live-action hybrid film, just watch ""Who Framed Roger Rabbit"" instead, or this film's sequel ""Looney Tunes: Back in Action"". This movie is just bland and one-dimensional.Rating: 3/10 ""Bad""",Space Jam
157,kennethtownsend-97230,MJ with the Slam,9,15 October 2015,"Space Jam is a very good movie for children who love sports. This movie stars Michael Jordan who is an NBA star at the beginning and then converts into a Major League Baseball player in the Chicago White Sox farm system. But soon after becoming a baseball player like his dad, many of the NBA's greatest get their talents stolen by aliens from another planet. When Michael finds out he soon is alerted and goes after these aliens to get the stars their talents back. While he's golfing in an instant he finds himself slipping through a small golf hole. When he comes out the other end of the hole he finds himself in looney toon land. He sees Bugs Bunny, Daffy Duck, Lola Bunny and all the looney toon characters you can think of. This movie teaches kids to keep thriving for what they want and never give up. It's telling them no matter how tall people are, how tough people are, never give up because of some disadvantages. When Michael is challenged by the aliens who stole the stars talents Michael takes the challenge to face them. But they made a deal. If Michael won the stars would get their talents back, and if the aliens won Michael had to stay in looney toon land forever. The aliens had accepted the challenge. Halfway through the game Bill Murray shows up and helps Michael. When Michael gets the help from Bill, they come from behind and win. The stars get their talents back and Michael gets to go home. The moral of this story is to always keep thriving and never give up.",Space Jam

It manages to spend 90 minutes making Bugs, Daffy and the rest lest interesting and less compelling than they were in a 6-minute short 50 years ago.Michael Jordan, at the very least, is an entertaining, engaging screen presence.

Of course coming from this genre it isn't a masterpiece or something like that but it is really outstanding like I said for it's genre. I think the characters are great.

162,grintemcstinger,A commercial,2,13 April 2014,"I still remember seeing this movie the first time back in '97 or '98 when it arrived on video. As a kid who was obsessed with the NBA and was a WB toons fan this had to be a treat. When I first watched it, I couldn't really pinpoint what really bothered me. I didn't sit right with me and I remember regretting forcing my parents to buy the VHS. I know I was disappointed with the way basketball was depicted... it had absolutely no foul or any sort of rules for that matter. Naturally, no one should expect realistic basketball from this movie, but I still had hoped they would've managed to keep some rules in some way, while still delivering the looney exaggerations.But as an adult I have to say that this is the least of the movies problems. At the time as a kid, I didn't notice that I didn't laugh... or better yet, I've noticed it - I just didn't want to admit it to myself. This is really weak humor, especially compared to the old, classic WB cartoons. It's uninspired, toned-down to the bare minimum and in some instances really annoyed me, because it tried to be ""cool"" at the same time. And that is the main problem I'm having with this one - it's not funny to me, at all, both as a kid and adult. The acting is bad, but that's rather forgiving considering that NBA players aren't professional actors to begin with. The animation and artwork is good, great actually, but by far not enough to save it. It's just a heartless commercial for all the merchandise. Watch ""Who Framed Roger Rabbit"" and/or ""White Men Can't Jump"" instead.",Space Jam
163,frostyfrog,Space Jam,3,17 March 2020,"Space Jam is a film directed by Joe Pytka that stars Michael Jordan, Wayne Knight and the Looney tunes in which the Monstars challenge the Looney Tunes to a game of basketball who in turn recruit the now retired Michael Jordan for help. Space Jam is something of a cult classic is most film circles and while I can see the appeal it has at least from a pop culture standpoint, I can't see that appeal from a filmmaking standpoint. The plot doesn't really have character development beyond Michael Jordan at least as characters mature through their issues really just because the script says they do. Speaking of the script, it is littered with repetitive dialogue, product placement and one-dimensional and obnoxious characters both human and animated. I really feel that these Looney Tunes work better in a quick 15 minute or half an hour show because their humor doesn't wear out in that time frame the way it does over the length of a film. Now on a more positive note, I have to say that I do enjoy the music in the film and when the tunes are at their looniest the animation is stellar but even the animation led itself to some pretty awful editing during the third act. The third and first acts of this film felt incredibly short as well as the second act dragged on and on and while this film was an hour and a half long it felt like two hours and fifteen minutes. If you enjoyed this film, I understand why as there are elements of appeal that exist here and even I can't deny that but I also can't deny that this film had plenty of problems and while I didn't go into this film expecting it to be a masterpiece or a game changer, I expected it to be at least decent and entertaining and for me, it was inconsistent and forgettable.",Space Jam
164,yayamafiya-55211,Totally Unrealistic,6,15 June 2019,"I watched this movie on a plane recently. It was pretty good until cartoons started interacting with real people. It was cool to see michal jackson playing basketball and baseball, but then it got really looney. He gets transported to some kind of planet and starts playing basketball with cartoon characters.It was cool because bill murry is in it and he is always funny. But I just couldnt wrap my head around the ludicrous storyline. They are playing basketball to save the planet. And it's against cartoon characters. Yep, you read that correctly.If you want to see a good sports movie, you can watch Rudy, which is about a guy who plays football against, yea, real people.There is one moment in this movie where michal jackson's arm stretches like the length of the basketball court and slams dunking it in. Totally unrealistic. But otherwise, the movie is kind of fun. You can probably eat popcorn with a little kid and watch it with them and they wont be able to notice the inconsistencies and probably wont think it is strange. But if you have any taste in great cinema, pass on it, or be sure to be prepared for it to not make sense.If you like watching people play basketball with cartoons then you will be my guest, but dont say I didnt warn you about what it would be about.That's pretty much all it's about.

170,Zaptharo,"A funny, wacky family friendly film, but comes up short..",6,24 February 2009,"Since the release of Who Framed Roger Rabbit?, animators and producers have been trying to emulate the blockbuster success. Some were good, many were mediocre or worse. Space Jam happens to fall into the category of okay, but with many flaws.This wacky film stars basketball legend Michael Jordan, who is more or less, a so-so actor. At the height of his career, Michael wanted to retire from basketball to play baseball. To promote sales and products, Hollywood producers gave him a chance to act in front of the camera. He agreed, but only playing as himself.The real strong point of this film is that it stars the Looney Tunes, some of the world's most recognized and beloved cartoon characters. Despite their grand entrance, the movie received lukewarm reviews in it's first few weeks. It was also criticized for having a somewhat ridiculous story, in which a tyrant named Mr. Swackhammer (Danny Devito) wants to build a new attraction by kidnapping Michael Jordan and the Looney Tunes at a distant theme park known as Moron Mountain. Throughout the movie, Michael and his buddies work hard to challenge the tyrant's helpers to a basketball game. If they lose, they will be forced to entertain the hard-pleased natives of Moron Mountain for all eternity.Space Jam is one of the few films where the Looney Tunes characters get their chance to express themselves on the big screen. Whereas most of their movies had basically added segments and poor animation, Space Jam was an original concept that gave the cartoon characters more depth. The animation looks beautiful and the live action blends in well with the cartoon environment.Unfortunately that doesn't make up for the fact that the jokes and gags that are famous in numerous Looney Tune cartoons didn't make it into the movie. Weak dialog and somewhat poor plots revealed in Space Jam doesn't compare to the humor of the old cartoons or the better writing seen in Who Framed Roger Rabbit. Some of the actors come up short, including the NBA players who simply play themselves. Wayne Knight was a goofy addition to the cast, but he was simply more annoying than tolerable. Bill Murray (Saturday Night Live, GhostBusters, Groundhog Day) was a disappointment, coming across as irritated and unlikeable by playing himself.Still the good outnumbers the bad, and personally I think the critics were being too harsh on this film. The addition of Lola Bunny was a nice touch, and there were a few hilarious moments worth mentioning. It also has a good soundtrack, which fits in with the theme of Space Jam.The film had a lot of merchandise going for it, and sadly it didn't hold up to it's full potential. If you get past the so-so acting of the live actors and the somewhat clichéd plot, Space Jam is a funny film that will entertain kids and Looney Tune fans alike. It wasn't merely aiming at an adult demographic, but it is still enjoyable by those who have watched the cartoon shorts. Not the best live action/animated film, but certainly not the worst either.Six out of Ten.",Space Jam

But Jordan sure can play ball.  The basketball moments are what this film's about.

If you want a good Looney Tunes film, check out any of the compilation flicks like ""The Bugs Bunny/Road Runner Movie.""To start the movie off, we're treated to a supposed-to-be-heartwarming scene in which a young Michael (you know, that classic Looney Tunes character Michael Jordan) is playing basketball outside and tells his dad about all the things he wants to do when he grows up.  Yeah, like we need to know why a tall, bald, black guy is playing basketball thirty years later.  It's definitely not the nine zillion he makes annually, but because it's his boyhood dream.  Besides, one line of adult Michael's slushy-voiced dialogue reveals that he's probably not qualified for too many other professions.After the obligatory scene in which the bad guys plot their evil scheme (and oh boy, someone got Danny DeVito to do the voice of the leader Swackhammer...I guess Tim Curry was unavailable), we're finally introduced to the Looney Tunes characters.  Bugs Bunny acts like the annoying kid in the classroom with ADD and sounds like Stimpy (great, Billy West does some of the voices, like I needed another reason to hate this movie!) and is for some reason intimidated by these little alien creatures that Tweety would have no trouble kicking the behinds of.  Anyway, Bugs & Co. challenge the aliens to a game of basketball, drag Michael to (shudder) ""Looney Tunes Land"" (shudder), and they win.  Yay-freakin'-ay.First, the special effects of combining Bugs and Michael are just passable but not great.  There is no sense of wonder or real interaction like in ""Who Framed Roger Rabbit?""  Perhaps the writers weren't very imaginative on how the characters could be more physical with each other, but Bugs looked more alive next to human co-stars in the 1948 movie ""My Dream is Yours.""The Looney Tunes characters are pale imitations of their actual selves.  A new unnecessary female rabbit named Lola is introduced (I guess the writers forgot about Honey Bunny, whom I would have loved to see turned into a main character for this flick).  She is nothing more than a placeholder for the ""token female"" spot.  And I'm sure Ivan Reitman thought the ""Don't ever call me 'doll'"" line was going to be springing from the lips of every young girl out there who didn't leave the theater in disgust at this point.  Instead, it's just a stupid built-in merchandise slogan.  Give me ""Beep Beep"" any day over that.Daffy's in it, Porky's in it, Foghorn's in it, Sylvester's in it, and Elmer's in it (really, practically no other characters were given dialogue). They look ugly, they sound ugly, and their personalities have all been reduced to expansions on their vocal traits.  Are we positive Disney wasn't secretly involved in hopes to ruin these great characters?Then there is a very disturbing long sequence in which several Looney Tunes get hurt during the basketball game, followed by a long shot of some minor characters in various states of dying.  Did someone actually think this is FUNNY??  I've never considered any cartoon violence as ""gratuitous,"" but this is most certainly an ugly, witless scene of just pain.  And this movie comes from the same man who did the fun, harmless ""Ghostbusters??""This movie has no redeeming qualities whatsoever.  It's a ninety-minute Nike commercial.  There's even a line of dialogue in which the sometimes-funny Wayne Knight tells Michael to support all of his endorsements (""Put on your Hanes(TM), we'll grab a Big Mac(TM)...,"" etc.).  It's supposed to be disguised as self-parody, but comes off as pompousness.  I guess promoting ninety different companies was also part of young Michael's boyhood dream.

My only nitpick is the Animaniacs Characters aren't in there, and that could've made the movie a lot funnier, but then again, this is really nit picky, it's a great movie for 90's kids, and it's a good movie for all sports fans all around the world. The animation has definitely aged well, it's well detailed, and while it may not be as good as that iconic image of Buzz Lightyear and Sheriff Woody flying in the sky, Space Jam is still a classic.",Space Jam
189,ekveland,Actually the worst,1,13 June 2015,"I tried watching this for the first time in 2016. I'm a fan of nineties cheese, so I thought this would be a good watch. Boy, was I wrong!This is just bad. Not bad in a funny way. Not bad in a so bad it's good way. Just a hard watch. The animation is ugly. There are parts that were done in a 3D that looked like a 1994 screen saver. There were attempts at making the characters look more 3D using an airbrushing effect that had the effect of making them look like they had the bevel effect applied in Photoshop. Despite coming out a whole eight years after Who Framed Roger Rabbit it somehow were much worse at integrating live actors with the animation. Heck, I think Mary Poppins probably did a better job in the sixties.The Mel Blanc impressions were incredibly jarring, with dialogue that made Chuck Jones cringe. Not Billy West's proudest moment I must say. The movie takes itself way too seriously, and the product placement is so clumsy one scene is literally just a character reading out sponsors. There's no punchline, no self-referential wink and it doesn't even go on for long enough to make it a joke.At least these days, the 90s hip hop and R&B soundtrack has a certain charm where at the time it was meant to capitalise on what the cool kids were listening to at the time.Not sure how could manage to make Looney Tunes so soulsuckingly dreary and unfunny, but there you have it: The worst product of cynical marketing towards kids. Completely unwatchable today, not even for nostalgia-purposes.",Space Jam
190,dolite91,Enter the great story of Space Jam!,8,25 August 2007,"I was not surprised that many people criticized the movie. I myself agree that this movie had destroyed our beloved Looney Tunes characters' personalities. Other than that, Space Jam featured the first appearance of Bugs' love interest, Lola Bunny, who is very seductive. However, I still enjoyed it. This movie may only be for young children and is underrated. But to me, it is something new. Space Jam had moved our Looney Tunes characters into a basketball game against the Monstars that would decide their fate. Moveover, it also featured many real-life basketball players such as Michael Jordon and Larry Johnson. However, it is a pity that this movie seemed to receive more criticism from movie critics. But remember this: CRITICS MAY SOMETIMES BE WRONG. See what happened to Space Jam instead? It became a box office success, grossing over 90 million in America alone Lastly, I laughed a lot of time when I was watching the whole movie. I would say that it is better than the 2003 Looney Tunes: Back In Action. Looney Tunes: Back In Action seemed to be a serious movie with less comical scenes than Space Jam but I still enjoyed because it is an adventure film. Space Jam is great. Long Live Space Jam. Highly recommend. My Rating:8/10",Space Jam
191,mundiegaminghd,Great movie,8,19 September 2018,I dont understand how the overall rwting on IMDB is 6.4 when the lowest review score i have seen is 7.... anyways its a great movies fir kids and its one of the best basketball movies of all time period.,Space Jam
192,rob-544,One Long Commercial,4,24 January 2001,"I'm a big Michael Jordan fan. That's a fan of Michael Jordan, the basketball player, not the actor. He's good in one-minute commercials, but he's bad, very bad in this movie. This movie was nothing more than a large advertisement for Michael Jordan and the product he endorses.I love sports, and have a few favorite sports movies. But most sports-related movies are terrible and this one falls is one of the worst of the worse.",Space Jam
193,Iama5yrold,Lola Bunny is a Fox.,10,8 November 2005,"I give this movie a 10 not because it is great or because it is a fantastic children's movie or anything like that. I give this movie a ten because somehow it manages to entrance me whenever it is on. Whether it is the opening shot of young Michael or the first line of Danny DeVito, something about this movie just pulls me in. I also give this movie a ten because Lola Bunny is a fox. That voice! No wonder Bugs is so hooked.But seriously, now. This movie is simple and ridiculous. It's fun to see Michael Jordan's arm stretching like mad, Bill Murray is always entertaining (""Larry *Bird*'s not white, he's clear,"" or something like that), and you get to check out a rabbit. Not to mention the soundtrack: Space Jam - one of the most painful theme songs to date; Fly Like An Eagle - foreshadowing; and of course the somehow wholesome R.

195,johnnymyman-68540,A Shameful Mention,1,12 July 2017,"What on earth were Warner Brothers thinking making this monstrosity of a movie called Space Jam? The director/producer should've been either bankrupt, or fired a very, very, very long time ago. This trainwreck of a movie has such a pointless plot, Wayne Knight was such an embarrassment in this movie, because all he did in this movie, was act so annoying and stupid. At least 3 years after, he had redeemed himself by doing the voice of Al, from Toy Story 2, I mean it's as simple as that. Bill Murray was an unnecessary choice for the movie, the villains were weak and pathetic, and Michael Jordan I understand he is a great basketball player, but he makes a terrible actor with this movie. Dr. Swackhammer was an annoying and a unimaginative villains in film history, the Nerdlucks don't even look like aliens at all, instead they look more like cockroaches that I could step on, and when they turn into Monstars, it doesn't get better, instead, it gets worse, because the Monstars are one of the weakest and most pathetic names ever for a basketball team along with the ToonSquad. And the Looney Tunes characters looks like that it comes from one of the Happy Meal boxes, and looks like bunches of ugly caricatures, and worse, the voice- acting sounds different, and doesn't even connect to the original Looney Tunes. That is a very bad excuse for Looney Tunes, and that's just shameful. It even makes the voices of Fanboy & Chum-Chum were slightly better than this. And also, not to mention, the two worst Looney Tunes characters are Tweety and Lola Bunny, I mean, why did those two had to appear in this trainwreck of a movie? This makes me wanna hate this movie even more, because not only are Tweety and Lola Bunny's the worst Looney Tunes characters ever, they are the most annoying cartoon characters ever, almost as annoying as Dora The Explorer. And not only that, there was a seen where they ripped-off one of the scenes from Walt Disney's Alice in Wonderland. Also, the jokes in it is absolutely miserable. It has no real jokes at all, all it is just a bunch of wretched jokes that makes one feel disgusted every time they here a cringeworthy jokes from this movie. This movie should've won some Razzie Awards for being the worst movie ever. The animation is horrible, the jokes are pathetic, the characters are annoying, the plot is repugnant, and the music is also suckish. This is the worst Looney Tunes ever next to Tweety's High-Flying Adventure that I had ever seen in my entire life. It's even worse than Shrek Forever After, which that sequel is bad, but not as bad as Space Jam. This movie will only entertain little kids and younger, and frustrates adults. This is one of those family films that you should stay away, if you wanna watch a much better family film, watch Ferdinand and The Greatest Showman. But, STAY, AWAY, from Space Jam, it is a terrible film. I give this movie a 1/10. Looney Tunes Back In Action was bad, but I will admit, it's not as bad as Space Jam, Space Jam is just a horrible excuse, and it just feels like a preschool affair.",Space Jam

Just sit back and enjoy the crazy antics of the Looney Tunes and if you're a Jordan fan that is just icing on the cake. Jordan did a great job of acting and seemed to be having fun doing the movie. The pace of the movie is good and doesn't get boring for kids. The merging of animation and reality was superb, similar to Roger Rabbit, which I believe was made by the same producer. The reason it was not a ten for me was that some scenes were not necessary or drag out a little too long.

Even though you may not entirely understand everything that is going on in the movie at a Young age, it is still pretty easy to get into the movie. Not spoiling anything in this movie in this Review..but i will say that even today it is an entertaining Movie that i will pick up here and there and still have a fun time watching. Such a simple storyline, yet enjoyable down the years. Michael Jordan, Looney Tunes, and your classic cartoon villains trying to take over. This is just one of the Movies that, well...got me interested in movies. And that's why i gave it a 10. Not necessarily just because it was my favorite....it had a lot of elements that i simply enjoy. And on top of everything, its a movie about Basketball, which is something i'm passionate about. In all honesty, when it comes right down to it. I can only say one thing. If you haven't seen this movie yet, or even haven't watched it in a while. Go pick it up.

211,gbean2397,Space Jam - A '90s Guilty Pleasure,9,17 July 2016,"This movie is far from being a masterpiece, but it is a dumb & fun film to enjoy, especially with your kids, as well. I mean come on, you've got Michael Jordon helping the Looney Tunes in a basketball game to save them from being enslaved by aliens for their amusement park, it is an unbelievable thing to see in film, but hey, Hollywood will green-light anything. This is a movie I've seen as a little kid on VHS, and I simply fell in love with it, and since then it has become a guilty pleasure of mine.I wasn't put off by Jordon's acting, I thought he did... okay. Not Oscar-worthy, but I believe he did better than Shaq. I also enjoy the other famous b-ball players playing themselves in this, especially Charles Barkley and Patrick Ewing. And you've got Bill Murray basically playing his nonchalant self. *Spoilers:* There's one moment when the villain first sees Murray, he says, ""I didn't know Dan Aykroyd was in this picture."" Love that. XD The animation with the Looney Tunes was really good for its time, aside from the basketball court which looks really fake, but, eh. And it's also good to see ALL of the Tunes in this, a majority of them attending the b-ball game.The one thing one can't deny is the amazing soundtrack featured in the film, especially the title song, Fly Like an Eagle, I Believe I Can Fly, Basketball Jones, For You I Will, etc. I even always sit through the entire end credits just to listen to the songs in it. It's astounding this one film has so many great singers on its soundtrack.Also, check out the DVD audio commentary to this film, it's actually hilarious, it has voice actors Billy West (Bugs Bunny) and Dee Bradley Baker (Daffy Duck) interacting with Bugs and Daffy, the latter two who steal the show. And it's always a bit funny to hear director Joe Pitka literally walk in and out of the commentary by hearing his footsteps and door closing.I'm sorry, I couldn't be the only one who truly likes this film. It's certainly better than Looney Tunes: Back in Action, that's for sure. If you (or your kid) likes Looney Tunes, then give this one a shot, you may find some form on entertainment out of it. Not a masterpiece, but certainly not as bad as the Rotten Tomatoes rating makes it out.",Space Jam
212,DaveDaveTor,It's good mixing real characters and cartoons creatures,8,16 January 2015,"I've recorded it so often in the past and even now. I remember the first time I've watched this, and saw one of favorite idols like Michael Jordan taking part in a mixture between cartoon world and real world. TODAY I still like this movie made from a qualified crew which arranged so good the two mixed cinematic visions. Some producer can do that too as plan and organize everything in a similar mode. THE WAY M. Jordan also does the actor makes me more fair of him than before. One of the best entertaining and sport movies of the '90s watched. Also fine the interaction between cartoons and human characters and well organized and overlapped, considering the relevance of Looneu Tunes. I recommend this movie for the families and the sport lovers !",Space Jam
213,bradley-84075,"Lousy and awful, find something else to watch!!",2,16 September 2015,"What a horribly made movie, blame the producer, director or who ever is responsible for such a STUPID STORYLINE.it COULD have been good, it had all the looney tunes cartoons and some basketball greats. The IDIOT who produced or wrote the movie, never ever saw bugs bunny cartoons before. those doing the voice over for the cartoons? didn't even try to get the voices right.then it has bugs bunny, a male, kissing Michael Jordan, another male with a deep kiss?? offensive, wrong and embarrassing. Its as if it was MJ's mother who wrote the movie, all about kissing his a.. and often showing MJs shoes then slowly going up to his up close face; and this happens at least a few times. if you're a female and have some romantic ""thing"" for MJ? and like seeing his UP CLOSE!! face over and over, showing his mid section up close? then its the movie for you.if you want a family movie? Then DO NOT waste time on Space Jam. find something else. towards the beginning it has bugs sexually frustrated in a stupid, awkward way. Again, none of the cartoon characters act or sound like the original, its completely sad, had to be monumentally sad for those who wasted money buying a movie ticket.It could have been an OK movie but since the producer never saw bugs bunny or any other of those characters before? he ruined it; would be nice to find out the producer/director went bankrupt and never made any other moviesThe movie has Newman from Seinfeld, so at least he's funny. but its a non existent or incoherent story line, close ups of MJs face and mid section, .ss kissing of MJ overall in a weird way, and the . is supposed to be the letter 'a'.Small children may be able to see cartoon figures running around on the screen and be entertained even though they don't know what its about and there's no storyline; so they can be amused for a while; That plus i don't recall hearing any flagrant profanity, so common in family movies in 2015 so it got 2 stars out of 10 instead of 1.",Space Jam

And over how humanity are unaware of him and not acknowledging him and what he does with his powers and abilities like hard work.That's why he turned out like both Master Control Program and Ultron after the end of the prequel and before the beginning of the sequel!I want to tell about the Space Jam movies to both Michael Jordan and LeBron James as basketball players (retired and not), and producers and actors of both their two movies, Anthony ""Andy"" Davis, Klay Thompson, Damian Lillard, Nneka Ogwumike and Diana Taurasi about Michael and LeBron's movies in my home country, my hometown and its stadium for NBA and ESPN events as they always will come.",Space Jam

230,paulowdl,Underrated,9,1 September 2005,"After reading reviews of ""Who Framed Roger Rabbit?"" and ""The People vs. Larry Flint"", I feel compelled to comment on ""Space Jam"". The reason is this - Bob Hoskins received praise for his work in ""Roger Rabbit"" and one of the reasons many reviewers gave was that he had to interact with cartoon characters. On the other hand - Courtney Love was praised for her ability to play a character who, according to some reviews, was similar in her past and personality to Ms. Love herself. How difficult, they said, to basically play yourself.Here is Michael Jordan, playing opposite cartoons, AND playing himself - not a character similar to himself - but his honest-to-goodness own self. He does so with insight and self-deprecating humor. Witness the scene where he is playing baseball in the minor leagues. Everybody is so anxious to see him succeed that even the opposing catcher is going to let him know what pitch is coming and where it's going to be. Mr. Jordan, the actor, handles this scene beautifully, a look of resignation, disgust, and then determination NOT to be used in this manner. Is that not brilliant acting? To appreciate the comparison to Bob Hoskins, watch the scenes where Jordan is transported into cartoon land and is treated with slapstick hilarity worthy of all the old WB cartoons. In my opinion, this is as good as Hoskins slipping and sliding his way out of a desperate situation in ""Roger Rabbit"".For students of literature and film I feel the need to point out what I've regarded as a metaphor or analogy (I never did learn the difference). Are the Mon-Stars and their evil leader (Danny DeVito) a metaphor for the influence of gambling in sports? Something to ponder.Anyway, overall, a very entertaining movie for kids, fans of WB cartoons, and especially for basketball fans and Michael Jordan fans in particular. I highly recommend it and have rated this movie 9 out of 10.",Space Jam

Terrific feel good movie for all ages to add in the family movie collection.",Space Jam

Looking back now, I wonder if I could have made more of myself if I hadn't have chosen instead to just watch Space Jam multiple times a day, 7 days a week, 365 days a year, till death come to part me from this worn DVD.I could have chased my dreams, I could have been somebody, I could have at least measured up as a functional member of society.No.I watched Space Jam.I regret nothing.(Doth not judge me, for they had a real jam goin' down...

I though it would be okay, but I was wrong. I noticed a lot of bad shading(as some people say) But, i assumed it would be fine. When bugs put him in a ball I could feel the pain. For some people, they may like it, but if you aren't a fan of 90's humor and hate basketball players, this is not the movie for you. Also, We had to watch it al the time which made me hate even more",Space Jam

242,shank3,"good movie, with good special effects. good plot",9,2 August 2007,"Every so often a child's movie comes along, that the children will love, and the parents will not mind watching. Space Jam was something I saw when I was younger when it first came out in the cinemas. I loved it then, and only recently saw it again and still loved it.Space Jam is a somewhat biography of Michael Jordan, and it is smart because it has story lines going along. The story of Michael Jordan and the loony tunes characters. There are some very funny parts, but also sad parts. Although it only has a rating of about five it deserves at least a 6 or a 7. The special effects 10 years ago, or similar to the special effects in movies I see today.There are some excellent performances in this movie. Michael Jordan does well, and Larry Bird. There are also some funny cameos from former NBA players. Like Charles Barkley, Shawn (the storming Mormon) Bradley, Larry Johnston, and muggys Bogues to name a few.I recommend you go and see it, and it is the best loony tunes movie by a long way. It should appeal to many different audiences.7/10",Space Jam
243,LBSWebSite,"""Air and hare - What a Concept""",6,24 September 2003,"During the year 1994, Michael Jordan was set to retire from the game of basketball, when he got the idea of going on to play professional baseball.  One year later, he was given the opportunity to act in front of the camera (as himself, of course) and retain his marksmanship of playing the game of B-Ball.  The 1996 animated/live-action release of ""Space Jam"" shows a bit of both.Who would of thought that his supporting actors would be the most recognizable, brilliant and crazy co-stars Bugs Bunny and the Looney Tunes themselves?  Ivan Reitman can, since the director of ""Ghost Busters"" produced the family feature at a cost of $100 million dollars plus, almost three times the amount it cost to create the walt Disney masterpiece, ""Who Framed Roger Rabbit,"" which ""Space Jam"" tried to compare to, but received lukewarm results.It's really interesting to see for the first time that the entire Looney Tunes bunch come to the big screen in a while, especially now when the use of digital effects for the film by Kodak's Cinesite Studios (U.S. and U.K.) make it fun to see.  But few of the cartoon gags, jokes and pranks (perfectionized by Chuck Jones, Friz Freleng, Robert McKimson and others during the heyday of Warner Bros. cartoons in the 40's and 50's) are rarely seen in the film.  Plus the weak dialogue the Mon-Stars talk out with (the script penned by Leo Benvenuti, Steve Rudnick, Tim Harris and Herschel Weingrod) can't compare well to thew wit and humor exemplified by Jeffery S. Price and Peter Seaman in ""Roger Rabbit"" in 1988, which makes the outcome seem disappointing. But the addition to the cute, sexy and dazzling Lola Bunny to the Looney Tunes roster, who can now be seen on almost every detail of merchandise you see in stores with Bugs and company, and hopefully in feature cartoons, still makes it all the more fun to look at.The fact that `Space Jam' was based on the successful 1991 Nike commercial pairing Air Jordan and the wabbit together, somehow make up the reason that the movie only earned $90 million nationwide out of its $100 milion budget, (it did, however, exceed $225 million worldwide altogether, so that helps.)  Nonetheless, Space Jam is worth seeing, if you don't mind that it's an attempt to score the winning basket, be it a winning franchise, that is.Rating: 3 stars out of 5NOTE: The Two-Disc Special Edition DVD of the 1996 release of Warner Bros. Entertainment's `Space Jam' is coming everwhere to stores late October 2003.  This brand-new edition of `Space Jam' is sure to be THE definitive collector's series that both Looney Tunes and Michael Jordan fans have been waiting to get their hands on, like me for instance (a die-hard fan of the Looney Tunes.)ON DISC ONE: -- For the first time ever, `Space Jam' will be finally shown in a special, digitally mastered, 1.85:1 widescreen format and released in Dolby® Digital 5.1 Surround for clear, optimal audio performance. -- The film includes feature-length audio commentary from director Joe Pytka and the voices of the Looney Tunes (Billy West as Bugs Bunny; Dee Bradley Baker as Daffy Duck.)ON DISC TWO: -- A special behind-the-scenes documentary of the film with `Jammin' with Bugs Bunny and Michael Jordan.' -- An hour of special Warner Bros.' animated Looney Tunes/Merrie Melodies cartoons. -- `Space Jam' Music Videos: The hit song `Fly Like an Eagle' by Seal and `Hit 'em High' (The MonStars Anthem) from B. Real, Coolio, LL Cool J, Busta Rhymes and Method Man. -- Trailer, and more.",Space Jam

245,desjar99,Michael Jordan...,10,8 November 2011,"Michael Jordan and Bugs Bunny team up to create a master piece of galactic preportions. The mix of real life and cartoon is flawless, and Michael Jordan's kids are cute. The Looney Tunes team is the perfect comedic relief needed for the oppression of the Monstars. Bill Murray is definitely good, he sweats a lot as well which is good, as well. Michael Jordan's epic slam dunk at the end when he stretches his arm across the entire basketball court in the cartoon world against the Monstars is definitely his best slam dunk ever...even beating the classic Air Jordan...and he's a bad baseball player, that's why he returns to basketball. Muggsy Bogues, Charles Barkley, Patrick Ewing, and Shawn Bradley are good. Larry Bird is an impressive golfer.

246,derick8895,Top Notch Acting or Basketball?,9,28 November 2011,"The 1996 smash hit, Space Jam, received as much adoration from its young fans as it did receive criticism from its adult viewers. Directed by Joe Pytka, it stars NBA legend Michael Jordan, as he teams up with the Looney Tunes, to play in the ""Ultimate Game"" that decides the fate of these cartoon characters. It (the film) also features other NBA stars like Charles Barkley, Patrick Ewing, and so on. This was a Live- Action/Animated film, unique among its kind, following the other famous Live-Action/Animated film, Who Framed Roger Rabbit?.Although it received widespread acclaim from its younger viewers, people ultimately came to see Michael Jordan play basketball with the Looney Tunes, not to see him act. The real live athletes/actors, especially Jordan, were at best good, if not decent. These guys make their living playing sports, not reading scripts. To say, when it came to acting, they wouldn't win an Oscar. However, there is no doubt in anyone one's mind that the only person meant to play the hero in this movie would be none other than Michael Jordan. He doesn't possess the proper acting skills that a hero should have but his personality and the fact that he is who he is suits him best to the action of the film. Some critics claimed that MJ would eventually be featured in a full length film, this being ""the one."" Michael Jordan, at the time, possessed a certain aura, deeming him to be the best basketball player at the time, if not in history.In the same way people wanted to see MJ play basketball with the Looney Tunes, people wanted to see how the Looney Tunes would fare in a full feature length film. Scenes involving them spared no detail, as the personalities that we have come to know and love like Bugs Bunny and Daffy Duck are marvelously created and adapted to this movie. At certain points of the movie, the acting of the characters, especially the dialogue that went on with, was whimsical and clever at the same time. The personality and the acting of the Looney Tunes were best suited for the film, being that these characters would easily adapt to the plot of the film better than those of the Disney Brand. In one scene, there was a reference to Pulp Fiction and another scene where they made jest of Disney. In comparison to their famous short length cartoons, the Looney Tunes characters had to stretch out a bit more of their talent. New jokes and references were made, as they had a lot more screen time than they are accustomed to. The Looney Tunes had rougher acting than the real live actors because there was the demand the children put on them. Though there were references that were only understood by older audiences, the cartoon characters were put there to capture the attention and hearts of the children. Although they've included some of the classic acts of the characters, more had to be done because of the longer screen time they had.Overall, the film was great for younger audiences and, at the time, a technological marvel, as it combined the use of live action and animation to act as one. As a result, when it came to acting, it wasn't Oscar-winning material, but it sure captured the love of many children. I'd say that the athletes and characters gave the movie a bit more hype than it should have. I rate the film an 8.5 out of 10. Sorry, Mike, You couldn't get the perfect score like in the dunk contest!",Space Jam
247,casey-mye,Michael Jordan decides whether or not he wants to help the Looney Tunes in their basketball game against aliens to help free them from living a life of slavery.,10,1 February 2012,"Space Jam, made in 1996, has major sentimental values to me regarding my childhood. However, when evaluating the movie considering these three criteria: plot, characters, and rating, I must remove all emotional connections from ""Space Jam.""Michael Jordan began filming this movie during his second year back from his first retirement. However, the movie is about his retirement in which he plays baseball for the Barons. The Looney Tunes, in trouble with some aliens from outer space, know that he is the best and ""kidnap"" Michael to play against the little midget aliens in basketball. However, the aliens steal the talent of five famous NBA players and soon go from being little monsters to the ""Monstars."" Michael Jordan agrees to help the Looney Tunes in one more basketball game to help the Looney Tunes with their freedom. This plot, obviously cheesy, is a somewhat oversensitive to the target age group.The Looney Tunes, one of the most successful bunch of characters of all time, create the perfect environment for this movie. The mixture of cartoon characters and Michael Jordan make an odd balance dimensionally, but still did a solid job of creating a somewhat authentic reality.Lastly, the ratings for this movie are pretty low. This makes sense because these ratings are only done by adults, who are less likely to enjoy the movie simply because it was not addressed to their age group. Also, the movie is overall.. Well, corny! It's hard to enjoy something you know is too unrealistic to relate with.",Space Jam

So saying it is like a Muppets movie is absurd! I do agree that Marvin the Martian should have been the villain, mainly because DeVito's character got on my nerves.
