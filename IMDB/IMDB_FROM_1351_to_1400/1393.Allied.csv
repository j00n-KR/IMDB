0,TheLittleSongbird,"A wartime romance that could have been epic, but didn't quite make it",6,30 November 2016,"'Allied' has garnered a mixed reaction, on IMDb and with critics in general. This is completely understandable, and the mixed reaction and the reasoning for it mirrors my own feelings for the film. 'Allied' is not a bad film, but from seeing the trailers (which strongly suggested a film that would be more epic, more moving and more thrilling) to be honest was expecting a lot more.There is a lot to like about 'Allied'. Visually, it is a gorgeous film. The cinematography is rich in atmosphere and colour and is quite poetic too, while the sets, scenery and costumes are evocative and eye-catching. The music by Alan Silvestri is neither too intrusive or too low-key, instead stirring when it needs to be and understated again when needed. There are some thrilling and harrowing moments as well as some poignant ones in the more intimate scenes, personally thought the controversial ending was quite emotional but can definitely see why it won't work for some.Marion Cotillard gives a nuanced and deeply felt turn, nothing short of sensational. Brad Pitt's performance has been criticised (as well as defended), to me it was appropriately stoic, despite his character being nowhere near as meaty as Cotillard's, and he was a worthy partner for Cotillard, a little cold in places but mostly fiery. The supporting cast are fine.On the other hand, the script and pacing are uneven. The script is 'Allied's' biggest flaw, lacking plausibility in places, especially in the mission scenes, having too much padding that's overlong and adds little to nothing and some of the parts intended to be emotional laid it on too thick with the treacle and sentimentality. Much more could have been done with the psychological subtext, which would have made Pitt's character more interesting and given the story more consistent suspense and thrills.Pacing does drag badly frequently, primarily due to having superfluous scenes that lacked momentum and went on too long and also due to Robert Zemeckis' quite disappointing direction. There are moments, but it is a case of getting the job done but in a workmanlike and tame fashion, not the thrills and cleverness one expects from Zemeckis that is present in the best of his work.In summary, had potential to be epic as a wartime romance, but doesn't quite make it. Many great things, but a few big things that got in the way of fulfilling full potential. 6/10 Bethany Cox",Allied
1,Leofwine_draca,A throwback to the cinema of yesteryear,6,29 February 2020,"What I appreciated most about ALLIED is that it feels very much like the character-focused thrillers of postwar Britain, in which any number of leading men of the time found themselves investigating conspiracies and the like and struggling to separate good from bad. This time around it's the world of spying in occupied France, as Brad Pitt and Marion Cotillard play a married couple not dissimilar to those found in Pitt's earlier movie, MR. & MRS. SMITH. Halfway through, the action shifts to London and the story flags a little, only to pick up for a strong climax. It's not an action packed movie, although there are a handful of good set-pieces, but what sells this is both Pitt and Cotillard, the former strong-jawed and inherently decent, the latter full of spike and mystery.",Allied
2,SnoopyStyle,old fashion war romance,6,22 December 2016,"Canadian intelligence officer Max Vatan (Brad Pitt) parachutes into French Morocco in 1942. He joins resistance fighter Marianne Beauséjour (Marion Cotillard) posing as husband and wife for an assassination. Despite her rule, they begin a romance. The attack in Casablanca goes well and they escape to London. They get married and she delivers a baby in the middle of the Blitz. A year later, the family is living comfortably. Then Max is told that Marianne is suspected of being a Nazi spy.Everything in here screams old fashion Hollywood war romance epic. Pitt has the matinée good looks and Cotillard has the French exotic sensibilities. With Casablanca, it leaves the movie feeling a little artificial and too reminiscent of another era. Robert Zemeckis' directions are perfectly professional but non of it jumps out. Despite some early action, the tension takes a long time before rising. It almost feels like the movie only truly starts at the midpoint. It tries to be a psychological espionage thriller with varying success. Despite the great ingredients, this feels like a bland version of better epic memories.",Allied
3,boblipton,Nothing Much Going On Here,5,7 July 2020,"I have a jaundiced view of the works of Robert Zemeckis, and have had since the inane Whitman's Sampler philosophy of Forrest Gump. In this one, Brad Pitt is a WWII Canadian spy sent on a mission to assassinate the German ambassador in Casablanca with Marion Cotillard. They fall in love, get married, have a daughter and then he is told that she is actually a German spy, whereupon he runs around to prove she isn't.My problem with Zemeckis' work is they seem to be intended to show off the latest technical advances, like the creepy Abnormal Valley of The Polar Express. Here's it's the exquisitely precise, photorealistic and picture-perfect world of World War II, which only causes me to focus on the wart on Miss Cotillard's forehead and the fact that Mr. Pitt is finally developing wattles. It's a pity, because unlike, say, Keanu Reaves, he can actually act.",Allied
4,Prismark10,Here's looking at you,5,1 March 2017,"Allied by Robert Zemeckis is the pretender to the crown of Casablanca, part of it is even set there. Brad Pitt is a Canadian intelligence officer and Marion Cotillard is a French Resistance fighter acting as a collaborator who fall in love during a mission in Casablanca.We see them meet in the first half of the film as they undertake a dangerous mission to assassinate a German diplomat, who fall in love and then get married and settle in London. The film takes a turn when Cotillard comes under suspicion and it is her husband Pitt who has to reluctantly expose her.The plot is implausible, the pacing is poor and Zemeckis has made an empty film which does not live up to its initial promise.",Allied
5,claudio_carvalho,Love and Espionage in WWII,7,19 February 2017,"In 1942, during the World War II, the Canadian spy Max Vatan (Brad Pitt) goes parachuting to the French Morocco to meet the French spy Marianne Beauséjour (Marion Cotillard) that is posing of his wife in Casablanca. Their mission is to assassinate the German Ambassador in a reception. They live together for a couple of days and soon they fall in love with each other. When Max returns to his base in London, he brings Marianne and marries her. One year later, they have the baby daughter Anna during a bombing. One day, Max is summoned for a meeting in the feared V Section with his commander officer Frank Heslop (Jared Harris) and a secret service agent that tells that they suspect Marianne is a German Spy. Further, they will give a fake order to him to confirm whether Marianne is a spy or not. If she is, Max shall execute his beloved wife; otherwise they will be both executed. What will Max do?""Allied"" is a good film directed by Robert Zemeckis with a story with lots of action, romance and drama. The awesome performances of Marion Cotillard and Brad Pitt with magnificent support cast give credibility to the story. The beauty of Marion Cotillard is perfect for a story in the 40's. The scenes are very well balanced with intense action, romance and drama. The journey of Max Vatan to find whether his wife is a German spy or not is outstanding and the conclusion is magnificent. My vote is seven.Titles (Brazil): ""Aliados"" (""Allied"")",Allied
6,nogodnomasters,Play it again Marianne,9,28 August 2017,"Max Vatan (Brad Pitt) is a Canadian intelligence officer on a classified mission in Casablanca. Here he meets French resistance fighter Marianne Beauséjour (Marion Cotillard) working undercover in the German embassy. She poses as his wife as they get close. After a successful mission, they go to London, get married and have a child. Later, as D-Day approaches, security and secrecy becomes an issue that effects their life.Yes, I agree Angelina would have been better in the female lead, if not more interesting. Max has a lesbian sister, also working in London. It didn't add anything to the film, but for some reason Hollywood felt they needed to add it. The acting was top notch. The ending I didn't see coming, nor was it on my short list. The sadness of the film of love, life, sacrifice, and the greater good perhaps plays into the audience partial rejection as it leaves a bitter taste in their mouths.Guide: F-word, sex, brief side breast nudity.",Allied
7,classicsoncall,"""I keep the emotions real. That's why it works.""",8,20 November 2018,"I was surprised by the unmistakable references to the 1942 movie ""Casablanca"". There's the French Morocco location where Max Vatan (Brad Pitt) and Marianne Beauséjour (Marion Cotillard) first meet to open the picture, of course. The story itself is based on wartime intrigue, espionage, and romance, and it was probably too obvious a decision by the film makers to have Max ask Marianne to play The Marseillaise on the piano. And he did it by saying ""I want you to play it for me"".There's also a bit of ""Mr. and Mrs. Smith"" going for the principals, a kick to the gut for Max when he learns that his superiors believe Marianne is a German spy. The 'blue-dye' operation that the V Section chief intended to initiate sounded like something fictional, but during World War II, German prisoners of war were given denim jackets to wear with the letters 'POW' painted on the back. Eventually the number of POW's outnumbered the availability of denim jackets, so dark blue dye was used to stain their own Wehrmacht uniforms. Within the context of the story, the blue dye operation was meant to expose Marianne for her loyalty to the Nazis.Given Marianne's ease at maintaining a facade as a spy (see summary quote above), it takes some time into the movie to determine whether she married Max for love or not. I thought it was taking things pretty far to get married and have a child with someone in order to fulfill a mission, so when it's eventually revealed that she did pass along the 'blue dye' message, it's almost a twist in a story that winds up with an even bigger one at the finale. The thing that bothered me about the picture was how Max's superiors always knew what he was doing. As an experienced agent, it didn't seem credible that they'd always be a couple steps ahead of him to know what he was doing to find out the truth about his wife. But then again, he did engage in some risky behavior to learn Marianne's true identity.",Allied
8,lee_eisenberg,love and duplicity,8,22 May 2017,"Robert Zemeckis has mostly made audience-pleasing movies (I Wanna Hold Your Hand, Back to the Future, Who Framed Roger Rabbit, Forrest Gump, Cast Away). He occasionally opts for more mature content, such as 2012's ""Flight"". ""Allied"" is of the latter nature, although like the former group it looks to the past for inspiration.Brad Pitt plays a Canadian intelligence officer during WWII who goes to Casablanca (where else?) to kill the German ambassador. While there he hooks up with Marion Cotillard's resistance fighter and they eventually get married. But once they move to England, he learns that there's something that he didn't know about her.The movie makes sure to set the stage with the era's music and costumes. But the most important part remains the moral dilemma that Pitt's character faces. It's not any sort of masterpiece, but the acting makes up for the movie's flaws. Much of the camera-work helps tell the story (notice the scene where Pitt looks at Cotillard in the mirror).Overall, I recommend it.",Allied
9,jboothmillard,Allied,7,4 December 2016,"I saw the trailer for this film, it looked like it would have some exciting scenes, I liked the sound of the concept, and of course the leading actors got my attention as well, directed by Robert Zemeckis (Back to the Future, Forrest Gump, Cast Away, Flight). Basically set in 1942, during World War II, Canadian intelligence officer Max Vatan (Brad Pitt) travels to Casablanca in French Morocco, his mission is to assassinate the German Ambassador (Anton Blake). He is partnered with French Resistance fighter Marianne Beauséjour (Marion Cotillard), who escaped France after resistance group was compromised and killed, they pose as a married couple, in doing so they get closer. Marianne is trusted by the Germans and gets Max an invitation to the party where they plan to conduct the assassination, knowing they may not survive, Max and Marianne make love on the day. The mission however goes well, they survive Germans attempting to kill them, and as they make their escape Max asks Marianne to come with him to London, and to marry him, they do so, settling in Hampstead, and having a baby daughter named Anna. A year later, Max has a meeting with the Official of the Special Operations Executive (The Last King of Scotland's Simon McBurney), they tell him Marianne is suspected of being a German spy, who adopted her identity, the real Marianne was killed in France. To test their suspicions, Max is ordered to write down a piece of false intelligence for Marianne to find, if the information is picked up by German transmissions Max must execute Marianne, or he will be hanged for treason, otherwise Max must act normally. Max is ordered not to investigate the matter himself, but he defies this and visits former colleague Guy Sangster (Matthew Goode), who knew Marianne, but he has been blinded by a wartime injury, so cannot identify her, but he tells that resistance fighter Paul Delamare (Thierry Frémont) who worked with Marianne would be able to identify her. Max meets young pilot George Kavanagh (Daniel Betts) and gives him the picture of his wife, he instructs him to ask Delamare whether she really is Marianne, however the following night Kavanagh is reported as being killed, Max also hears the whole operation may be testing him before D-Day. The following night Max takes the place of a Lysander pilot to fly to France and meet with Delamare, who it turns out is being held at the police station, Max and the resistance break in and confront Delamare, who is drunk, but remembers Marianne is a beautiful pianist. Back in England, Max takes Marianne to a pub and demands she play the piano, she admits she cannot play and that she is indeed a German spy, she claims her feelings for Max are genuine, and confesses that she and her child were being threatened by German spies in London, including the woman across the road who often babysits. Max is unwilling to kill Marianne, he tells her they need to leave before the SOE catch them, they make it to the airfield, but are intercepted before they can board a plane, Marianne tells Max she loves him and to look after Anna, then shoots herself. In the end the commanding officer orders that soldiers report that Max executed Marianne as per his orders, so he will not be punished, after the war Max has the ranch he always wanted in Canada, and raises Anna, and there is a letter waiting for Anna when she is older, from Marianne. Also starring Pompeii's Jared Harris as Frank Heslop, Cloverfield's Lizzy Caplan as Bridget Vatan, Downton Abbey's Matthew Goode as Guy Sangster, Marion Bailey as Mrs. Sinclair, Game of Thrones' Anton Lesser as Emmanuel Lombard, Josh Dylan as Captain Adam Hunter and August Diehl as Hobar. Pitt is well cast as the intelligence officer torn between his feelings and his orders and duty, Cottilard is a good choice as the beautiful woman who may or not be co-operating with the enemy, the chemistry is just about there, there are indeed some exciting and memorable scenes, especially the assassination and the birth during the Blitz, you really follow the mystery element, and there is a constant feeling of claustrophobia and iciness, all in all it is a worthwhile Second World War romantic thriller. Very good!",Allied
10,ma-cortes,"A truly gripping and splendid film with enjoyable plot , attractive romance and impressive action scenes",8,14 August 2021,"Nice and spectacular movie with implausible elements in the story, but the relationship between Max played stoically by Brad Pitt and his lady love, Marianne , played seductively by Marion Cotillard , results to be very exciting and thrilling. As Pitt and Cotillard have great, believable chemistry. In 1942, a Canadian intelligence officer Max Vatan (Brad Pitt) who can speak French fluently , parachutes into the desert in North Africa and meets a female French Resistance fighter named Marianne Beausejour (Marion Cotillard) , as they join forces and go undercover on a deadly mission behind enemy lines. Later on , the two become lovers, and they reunite in London, but their relationship is tested by the pressures of war . Nothing is as it seems .Deception is an art. Truth is a test. Is love a lie? The enemy is listening. The closer he gets, the more dangerous it becomesIntriguing and sensitive WWII drama with a complex love story , thrills , plot twists , emotion and impressive finale . Despite this movie is presented as a action/drama set in WWII, the romantic and dramatic story is what makes this movie so powerful . The movie is pretty well , but packed with historical inaccuracies and implausible plot points .The picture competently portrays the WWII espionage , as two spy volunteers to go undercover behind enemy lines , as forming an expert
team to carry out their dangerous assignment , as the two pose as a married couple and grow close, despite agreeing that in their line of work feelings can get people murdered. I confess that I'm a sucker for wartime romances, love the drama of that era as well as the 1940's styles, so would lap up just about any representative of the genre , in fact it bears certain resemblance to ¨Shining Through¨ 1992 by David Seltzer with Michael Douglas and Melanie Griffith as two spies holding risks behind the enemy lines in similar style to Brad Pitt and Marion Cotillard . While this one may not be a classic, it is a good love story with some gripping intrigue , maximum tension , noisy action , suspense , twists and turns . There's a very credible chemistry between Brad Pitt and Marion Cotillard who fall in love with each other giving wonderful interpretations . Brad Pitt is especially excellent, playing with dignity and charisma the complex role of the sensitive but potentially betrayed officer . It's clearly Marion Cotillard finest performance, and just a perfect movie overall . It delivers the goods on many levels, is never tiring , neith boring , though not always believable. Two protagonists are very well supported by a good secondary cast , such as : Jared Harris as the ultimate professional, he's masterful as always and commands any scene in which he appears , Simon McBurney as S. O. E. Official , Matthew Goode as a seriously injured officer , Lizzy Caplan , August Diehl , among others .Set decoration , Production design by Gary Freeman and cinematography by cameraman Don Burguess are throwbacks to the old 40's movies . As well as evocative and attractive musical score by Alan Slvestri , Zemeckis's regular . The film was compellingly directed by Robert Zemeckis (Polar Express , Castaway, What lies beneath, Forrest Gump , Back to the Future I, II, III) . Rated : 7.5/10 , better than average thanks to Brad Pitt and Marion Cotillard delivering considerable and credible chemistry. Though it may indeed be highly improbable, it is nevertheless highly watchable.",Allied
11,blanche-2,I liked it in spite of what everyone else says,8,8 March 2017,"Director Robert Zemeckis gives us some breathtaking moments in ""Allied"" from 2015. The film stars Brad Pitt and Marian Cotillard as Max and Marianne, two spies who meet on a joint assignment in France and fall in love. Mission accomplished, Max proposes. She is allowed to come to England and marry him, and they have a beautiful daughter.One day Max's bosses call him in and say that they believe Marianne took the name of an executed resistance worker and is, in fact, a German spy. They order him to write down a fake message he will be given by phone, and if it shows up in transmissions the following Monday, they will know the truth. Then he must execute her. Max, however, has no intention of waiting until Monday to find out.By no means is this a perfect film and yes, some parts are easy to guess. When you've seen 5000 films or more, it's not hard to know what's going to happen after certain scenes. The script could have been a little more interesting. I certainly didn't find it sentimental and goopy as someone described it. And what the heck is wrong with sentiment anyway? It was not, to me, overdone.If I am being honest, I think the problem lay with the casting of Brad Pitt. He's a real honest-to-God movie star as they had in the old Hollywood, and I love him. But this is a role that should have been played by someone like Jason Isaacs or Tom Hardy or Tom Hiddleston. Pitt does not bring to the character the layers and depth which would have made this a richer film. He has the stoicism but little else. Also I found his face distracting - he's had injections in the bottom part of his face and it looks different.Cotillard, on the other hand, gives a brilliant performance of an expert spy who falls in love with her temporary partner, sending her life into another trajectory.Someone pointed out some modernizations that were off-putting. One was Max's sister as an out lesbian - highly doubtful in those days in England. The one I caught was the phrase ""take it outside."" It was like the Amelia Earhart movie with Diane Keaton where she says ""cut the crap."" Are these screenwriters kidding? A little more care needs to be taken when dealing with period pieces.The special effects were fantastic and brought home the idea of how close in proximity the war was to the British people. The scene with the ambassador was excellent; but my favorite scene was the one in the desert with the car. Beautiful.I recommend it. I thought it was well done and well acted, exciting in parts, and also poignant. To young people I say - don't be hardened to sentimentality at your age.",Allied
12,Quinoa1984,"slick and stylish and well made, but missing some pathos",7,22 November 2016,"I think if this had come from a director early in their career, a second or third film, I might cut Allied a little more slack. It tells a story that maybe we've heard a little bit before, giving some echoes to (obviously) 'Casablanca' since it begins in 1942 in the titular city and involves good-looking Hollywood stars in WW2 drama, and yet at the same time (mostly when it gets into its second half) it becomes kind of like a 'Spy Game' story (not un-coincidental as it's also a Brad Pitt film), in that kind of 'is-this-all-a-TEST' type of spy story that has also been common. But coming from Robert Zemeckis, and writer Steven Knight (ever seen Locke?) I think I expected a little... more, or some extra kick, something to make it fully stand out.He does deliver of course on making a polished, slickly made film. There's nothing technically speaking I can fault the film for... actually, I'm not sure if that's entirely true. There are two sequences that can be rightly criticized for lacking any/all subtlety: one involves the first time our main characters succumb to their lust in a car in the middle of a sandstorm... like, GET IT, their love and lust is so strong it can withstand the force of a giant North African sandstorm all around them! The second is when Marion Cotillard's character is giving birth... in an English town during a bombing raid at night, with the sky all lit up in fire and bombs going off everywhere. Yes, this is not at all hitting us over the head with the emotions we should be feeling.Of course I may be somewhat hypocritical in going after Zemeckis for such touches - I remain a big admirer of things like Forrest Gump, which certainly is not shot and executed with overall subtlety (not that it isn't there though, but I digress) - when he actually does give a lot of this material a strong, professional touch that I appreciated, especially when it came to suspenseful moments, like when a character is waiting outside in a car for the other to do do a killing in a store and, well, is he or isn't he coming out yet(?) Moments like that show the director's strength with the suspenseful moments. And yet, despite this (or because of it), and what is an intense performance from Marion Cotillard (lord knows she never lacks pathos), it's maybe the dullest film Zemeckis has helmed.I think the problem for me is the opening act, when Max and Marianne meet in Casablanca and have their assassination plot to carry out (one of the Nazis, by the way, in case you may not notice, was the Nazi in the bar basement sequence in Inglourious Basterds, nice touch whether intentional or not). I didn't feel not so much the chemistry of the actors but the growing attraction, largely from Pitt's side. His character is supposed to be more removed and detached, trying to keep it on the mission until, naturally, his emotions give in to Marianne's advances. But there was never a clear moment of that, and in the first act the actor seemed too... distant may be a word to repeat myself, but not in a mode where I could see the attraction and love really taking hold. Maybe another actor could have sold it better, or with slightly better material or build up. But by the 40 minute mark they already got to be together and we need to buy it, and I'm not sure I completely did, sandstorm besides.Pitt gets better when the main plot really kicks in, when the is-my-wife-a-German-spy suspicion gets planted by his superiors. He gets to work more conflict out, but even still he may be trying for subtlety when the film around him is asking for bigger emotions. If anything his performance here reminds me of that of Benjamin Button - also a film that features a good deal of sex, but lacks that extra spark - which was also ambitious but ultimately not terribly engaging. While the story leads ultimately to a place that carries a strong emotional payoff, it also had the sense of 'too little too late' for me.Allied is not a total loss by any stretch, in large part because Zemeckis is there to work, the period feel and look and costumes and design and everything about it is right and spot on, and Cotillard is terrific. Call it an expectations thing, but it's what I might call a positive letdown, if that makes sense.",Allied

16,writers_reign,There's A Girl In My Souk,8,25 November 2016,"Okay, what's the name of this movie? It opens in a Moroccon city that translates as White House; world war two still has plenty of mileage left in it; it's really a love story between an American guy and a European gal who speaks fluent English with just a hint of a charming accent; a Resistance worker strikes up La Marseillaise in a café full of German officers; it ends unhappily on an aerodrome whilst world war two is still running. No, believe it or not you're wrong! It's not Casablanca; we know that because there's no Victor Laszlo character or, if it comes to that no Ugarte, no Louis Renault, no Ferarri. So-called writer Steven Knight clearly thought this was sufficient to disguise his crib-sheet. Silly boy. So we're left with a technicoloured Casablanca that's about a fifth as credible as the black and white one created on the backlot at Warners and two pale imitations of Bogie and Bergman in Brad Pitt and Marion Cotillard. Don't get me wrong, Marion Cotillard is a beautiful woman and a fine actress, Brad Pitt is Brad Pitt. If you've never seen Casablanca you're almost sure to enjoy it.",Allied
17,zardoz-13,"""Mr. & Mrs Smith"" Versus the Nazis, it ain't!!!",5,28 November 2016,"The atmospheric World War II thriller ""Allied"" differs drastically from actor Brad Pitt's previous WW II epics ""Fury"" (2014) and ""Inglourious Basterds"" (2009). ""Inglourious Basterds"" emerged as a profane, tongue-in-cheek, Quentin Tarantino remake of director Enzo G. Castellari's superior 1978 Italian actioneer ""Inglorious Bastards"" about army deserters on a secret mission behind Axis lines. More recently, Pitt starred as a rugged U.S. Army tanker sergeant in ""Fury"" who breaks in a new driver during the twilight of World War II. ""Inglourious Basterds"" qualified as a satiric comedy with buckets of blood and gore, while the serious, straightforward ""Fury"" amounted to a gritty triumph from start to finish. Comparably, ""Allied"" is a trifling, romantic, espionage thriller that at best is half-baked. ""Back to the Future"" director Robert Zemeckis has cast Pitt as intrepid Canadian flier Max Vatan and Marion Cotillard as cunning French Resistance agent Marianne Beauséjour. They rendezvous in the sun-drenched town of Casablanca and together assassinate a Nazi ambassador at a gala dinner party. After they escape from this fracas, Max convinces Marianne to join him in London. Naturally, the two wed, and the pregnant wife delivers a daughter during an air raid. Eventually, British Intelligence informs our heroic protagonist that they suspect that his wife of is a double agent. Not surprisingly, Vatan refuses to countenance such a preposterous idea. If you've seen the trailer for ""Allied,"" you know that I haven't revealed anything significant because it contains all the information that I have given. Anybody who knows anything about vintage World War II thrillers knows the Humphrey Bogart and Ingrid Bergman classic ""Casablanca"" (1942) immortalized the action and intrigue of the scenic Mediterranean port city as an escape route for refugees from Nazi-occupied Europe. This tear-stained tragedy dealt with the sacrifices that an estranged couple made during wartime events that irrevocably altered their lives in the hereafter of Paris. Clearly, whether he admits it or not, Zemeckis is channeling the Warner Brothers epic in his own film. Initially, ""Allied"" gets off to a visually provocative start as an individual descends by parachute into the windswept Moroccan desert and then trudges across a sea of dunes until a native in an automobile picks him up in the middle of nowhere and takes him into town. No sooner has our heroic Canadian arrived in Casablanca and met Marianne, who establishes his identity to her friends, than he strangles a suspicious Nazi officer in a secluded telephone nook. Not only did Max recognize this official, but also this official recognized Max. Max caught him on the phone as he was about to notify his superiors. Of course, as well-dressed as he was, Max couldn't stab this dastard to death for fear of getting blood on his immaculate apparel. Nevertheless, it seems incredible that nobody interrupted the two as they struggled violently in the nook. Afterward, Marianne (Marion Cotillard of ""Public Enemies"") establishes Max's credentials with various Nazi authorities in Casablanca and then the pair plunge into the desert to practice marksmanship with their British STEN guns. This weapon looks unique because it was its ammunition clip sticks sideways out of the weapon. During the first half of ""Allied,"" or the Casablanca section, Max and Marianne are constantly testing each other to learn more about themselves. Marianne abhors Max's French-Canadian dialect, and Max ignores her obvious attempts to seduce him. Eventually, Max does capitulate to his hormones, and Zemeckis stages their opening tryst in a cramped automobile during a tremendous sandstorm. This scene is especially sensual, but Zemeckis doesn't show any more flesh that an underclothing advertisement. Later, Max and Marianne and attend the party. Mysteriously enough, some go-between has taped two STENS to the underside of a serving table. After a bomb explodes outside as part of a diversion, our heroes riddle Nazis galore in a volley of gunfire before they effect a flawless escape and return to London and safety. The London section of ""Allied"" isn't half as exciting as the Casablanca section. Max finds himself confined to a desk job, but he receives a promotion to Wing Commander. Everything looks bright and optimistic for our hero and heroine who now have an infant daughter. Predictably, Max reacts with incredulity and shock at the accusation that Marianne is a spy. British Intelligence decides to check her loyalty by running 'a blue dye' test on her. Meaning, they furnish Max with the kind of information that no Axis spy would think twice about sharing with their superiors. British Intelligence advises him that they will know the truth about Marianne before the weekend is up. Max decides to take things into his own hands and find out if the impossible is in fact possible. He assigns himself to fly a weapons haul to the French Resistance at night and exploit the time to question a one-armed Frenchman who knew Marianne. Predictably, Max gets the information, but he must shoot his way out of a confrontation with several German soldiers in a half-track truck. Unfortunately, neither Pitt nor Cotillard ignite the screen with luminous chemistry. They have some unforgettable moments, but they don't seem compatible with each other. The first half of ""Allied"" surpasses the second half where things turn hopelessly hackneyed and then spirals downward with a surprise. One of the biggest problems is ""Allied"" stalls out after Casablanca and Marianne isn't as active. Zemeckis has made a polished period potboiler that generates little suspense as Max investigates his wife's past. The cast looks spectacular in their period apparel, and the aircraft and equipment look reasonably authentic. Sadly, ""Allied"" doesn't boast enough of everything: action, romance, and intrigue. Max is like an inexorable force during the London half, but Zemeckis gives Marianne little to do. The characters behave irrationally and the contrived, bittersweet ending makes this potentially date friendly film into a big letdown. Ultimately, rarely a suspenseful exercise in cat-and-mouse espionage, ""Allied"" falls short of the equivalent of ""Mr. & Mrs. Smith"" versus the Nazis.",Allied

As Brad Pitt's ALLIED boss tells him early on in this story, marriages that begin ""in the field"" (between spies) NEVER end well. However, all Pitt films in the future need to be looked at as a Real Life version of CELEBRITY APPRENTICE, in which Brad's co-stars are auditioning to replace Angelina Jolie as the next Mrs. Pitt. In movies, of course, losers such as Marion Cotillard do not need to be presented with roses when it's ""a wrap"" for their characters--they can simply blow out their brains. Speaking of CELEBRITY APPRENTICE, perhaps the more important Real Life message of ALLIED is that Russian Strongman Vladimir ""Mad Dog"" Putin's ""natural child"" from his KGB wild oats-sowing days is about to become First Lady of the United States. Certainly White House Resident-Elect Rump would be well-advised to run one of ALLIED's ""Blue Dye Tests"" on Melancholia during his first week with the nuclear codes. When the stuff hits the fan, he can give her an ACTUAL pistol to follow in Marion's trajectory, and finally win his overdue Reality Show Emmy by selecting a fourth ""Mrs. Rump"" by means of FIRST LADY APPRENTICE.",Allied
19,neil-476,Flawed in the writing,6,16 May 2018,"Max Vatan falls in love with Marianne Beausejour on an assassination mission behind enemy line during World War II and invites her back to London where they marry and have a child. But a secretive security officer tells Max that they suspect Marianne is a spy. They will feed her false information via Max and, if this proves her guilt, then Max will have to execute her, or face being hanged himself. That much you will know from the trailer, and the issue of whether Marianne is guilty or not, and what Max gets up to in pursuit of the truth, are not matters which I propose to spoiler in this review.What I will say is that as soon as security man Simon McBurney (who really does do slimey and obnoxious better than almost anyone else) tells Max about their suspicions and what the protocol was for dealing with them, the film lost me.A huge question exploded in my head. It was ""Why are you telling him?"" The protocol could be applied just as effectively without Max ever knowing until Marianne's guilt was proved, so why would you tell him before he needs to know, and run the risk of him going off the rails and following his own course of action? Which, of course, is exactly what he does. A midnight trip to a police station in occupied France in order to interview a drunk, followed by breaking into a pub for a bit of patriotic piano-playing? Whoa, Nellie.I understand that the threat of having to execute your own wife is a terrific engine with which to drive a story, but the major flaw in its execution stalled it for me - a flaw which could have been easily solved with better writing, by the way.The film looks very authentic, and there are some good action sequences and pleasing and touching performances (and Pitt gets to do his Paltrow's head performance again), But it should have tried harder to stay on the rails, in my view.",Allied
20,ferguson-6,Keep the emotions real,6,22 November 2016,"Greetings again from the darkness. Every writer, director and actor dreams of being part of the next Casablanca  a timeless movie beloved by so many. It's rare to see such a blatant homage to that classic, but director Robert Zemekis (Oscar winner for Forrest Gump) and writer Steven Knight (Dirty Pretty Things, Eastern Promises) deliver their version with an identical setting, nearly identical costumes, and the re-use of a song (""La Marseillaise"") which played such a crucial role.Spy movies typically fall into one of three categories: action (Bourne), flashy/stylish (Bond), or detailed and twisty (Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy). This one has offers a dose of each blended with some romance and a vital ""is she or isn't she"" plot. The ""she"" in that last part is French Resistance fighter Marianne Beausejour played by Marion Cotillard. Her introduction here is a thing of beauty, as she floats across the room thrilled to be reuniting with her husband Max Vatan. Of course the catch is that Max is really a Canadian Agent and their marriage is a cover for their mission to assassinate a key Nazi. Yes, it's 1942 in Morocco.The two agents work well together and it's no surprise when this escalates to a real romance between two beautiful and secretive people. It seems only natural that after killing Nazi's and making love in a car during a ferocious sandstorm that the next steps would be marriage, a move to London, and having a kid. It's at this point where viewers will be divided. Those loving the action-spy approach will find the London segment slows the movie to a crawl. Those who prefer intelligence gathering and intrigue may very well enjoy the second half more. What if your assignment was to kill your beloved wife if she were deemed to be a double-agent? Max finds himself in this predicament, and since no one ever says what they mean in the community of spies, he isn't sure if the evidence is legit or if it's really a game to test his own loyalty. This second half loses sight of the larger picture of war, and narrows the focus on whether Max can prove the innocence of Marianne  of course without letting her know he knows something – or might know something.Marion Cotillard is stellar in her role. She flashes a warm and beautiful smile that expertly masks her true persona. The nuance and subtlety of her performance is quite impressive. Mr. Pitt does a nice job as the desperate husband hiding his desperation, but his role doesn't require the intricacies of hers. Supporting work comes via Jared Harris, Lizzy Caplan, August Diehl, Marion Bailey, Simon McBurney, and Matthew Goode.The Zemekis team is all in fine form here: Cinematographer Don Burgess captures the feel of the era, Composer Alan Silvestri never tries to overpower a scene, and Costume Designer Joanna Johnston is likely headed for an Oscar nomination. For a spy movie, the story is actually pretty simple and the tension is never over-bearing like we might expect. While watching the performance of Ms. Cotillard, keep in mind her most telling line of dialogue: ""I keep the emotions real."" It's a strategy that is a bit unusual in her world. How effective it is will be determined by the end of the movie.",Allied
21,phd_travel,Refreshing change - it's about the story and the characters,9,5 January 2017,"What an enjoyable WW2 movie. The tone and content of this movie is a right step in the direction of having the story and characters at the forefront in a Hitchcock way vs the violence of battle. There have been enough gut wrenching war movies concentrating on big battles and close ups on injuries so this is a refreshing change of perspective. Some action type WW2 movies have been getting ridiculous in recent years. In fact some of the best and most tense WW2 movies made in the 50s and 60s were spy movies that didn't feature too much fighting.The story is suspenseful enough in it's own way. The 2 leads collaborate on a mission to kill a German diplomat in Casablanca. By the way they do look pretty glamorously fitted out. Then they fall in love, marry in London and start a family but she comes under suspicion for being a German spy. There are a couple of fight scenes for those hungry for that in a war movie but it's the relationship of the couple that is the crux of the movie. The production values are good with a purposely slightly artificially clean look. Although it has the color palate, costumes and look of an older Hollywood Golden Age WW2 movie it isn't old exactly fashioned.A couple of slightly ludicrous plot points don't spoil the story too much. Like his totally whipped flight to Dieppe to ask the drunkard. Why didn't the people vetting her show her photo to witnesses who knew her like he was doing? There are some memorable scenes as well. The love scene in the desert storm, the birth in middle of the Blitz, are all quite unique in case you think you have scene it all. The ending wasn't too much of a surprise but it's good there wasn't some silly twist. A bit more explanation by her would have helped at the end.Brad is alright - a little puffy in the face but his French accent isn't good enough to fool anyone. His makeup to make him look younger makes his face a bit stiff. Marion is suitable for the role and looks good in costumes of the era. It's good that Hollywood is looking to the past for inspiration like in La La Land. There are so many good stories still to be told.",Allied

It is a solid film that relates that port of WW II about which we know very little – the spy techniques and manner in which the world struggled to oppose and ultimately defeat Hitler's Nazi Germany. If boundaries of commitment are vague, that is how war divides (and brings together) people from different countries and backgrounds.The date is 1942 in French Morocco during the World War II, the Canadian spy Max Vatan (Brad Pitt) parachutes into French Morocco to meet the French Resistance Fighter Marianne Beauséjour (Marion Cotillard) who is assigned to pose as his wife in Casablanca. Their mission is to assassinate the German Ambassador (Anton Blake) during a reception. They live together soon fall in love, breaking a rule in the system of spying. When Max returns to his base in London, he brings Marianne and marries her. One year later, they have the baby daughter Anna during a bombing. One day, Max is summoned for a meeting in the feared V Section with his commander officer Frank Heslop (Jared Harris) and a secret service agent (Simon McBurney) who tells Max they suspect Marianne is a German Spy. Further, they will give a fake order to him to confirm whether Marianne is a spy or not. If she is, Max shall execute his beloved wife; otherwise they will be both executed. The ending is terrifying.Zemeckis manages to mix just the right proportions of violence with erotica and with the able assistance of is excellent cast offers us an inside view of that part of WW II about which we know very little.

Starting as a casual professional encounter it grows deeper as the movie goes on. Without revealing anything about the movie their relationship gets rocky at one point due to certain circumstances. At this part there are some interesting intrigues that make you want to see the rest of the movie to get answers. The cast of the movie is just top notch. Brad Pitt and Marion Cotillard have nothing to prove anymore. They are both great actors and in Allied it just shows. The action scenes and all the rest of the movie are very well shot.

Jared Harris was awesome as always, but didn't have much of a role.The only thing remaining to discuss is the story, and I can't spoil it here.

27,sddavis63,A Wartime Tragedy,9,12 September 2018,"The pacing of ""Allied"" could be called into question - mostly because what you really have here are three stories in one, each with a very different feel, although the thread that holds the movie together runs through all three. The first is the story of the attack by the French Resistance on the German Ambassador in Casablanca, in Vichy-French held Morocco. The story opens with Max Vatan (Brad Pitt) - a Canadian officer working ifor British intelligence who's sent in to take part in the attack. He meets up with Marianne Beausejour (Marion Cotillard) - a member of the Resistance who's leading the attack. This part of the story was pretty fast paced and exciting. It leads in to the second story - a love story between Max and Marianne. They fall in love, and he takes her with him to London, where they marry and have a daughter and spend a couple of years living together in obvious domestic bliss. The story slows down here, befitting the new tone, and helps to flesh out the two characters. The domestic bliss is interrupted by the third part of the story, when the British come to believe that Marianne is actually a German spy, and if they can prove it Max is told that he'll be ordered to kill her. So the movie becomes a sort of suspense-drama. Is she or isn't she? And there's reason to believe either. In a sense these are three very different stories, but I thought they were woven together pretty well and made a movie that was both enjoyable and interesting to watch. Pitt and Cotillard both gave good performances. Marianne was a social animal who liked people and parties, and Max was more of a quiet loner who kept his emotions very much in check, and both actors captured those personalities. The two worked very well together. The movie does have some strange plotholes and inconsistencies. It was established in Morocco that Max's accent was Quebecois rather than Parisienne (very different) - but Marianne seems able to fix that in just a few days so that no one ever seems to become suspicious that Max may not be who he seems to be? That was a bit strange. And I thought the introduction of Max's sister as a lesbian with her lover in tow was awkward and unnecessary - a relationship unlikely to be lived so openly at that time in history, and therefore it came across as tokenism for today's audience more than anything else. But all movies are going to have points you can quibble about. These were things I noticed, but they didn't really detract from my enjoyment of the movie.""Allied"" builds up very nicely to its last few tragic scenes, and in the end the movie does become a tragedy more than anything else, with the end (with the reading of a letter that Marianne wrote to her daughter) being truly heartwrenching. I'd say that ""Allied"" is by no means perfect - but it is an altogether enjoyable movie with a compelling story (or stories) and believable performances from the leads. (9/10)",Allied

Steven Knight wrote the screenplay, and Brad Pitt and Marion Cotillard star in the film. It tells the story of a Canadian intelligence officer, that falls for a French resistance fighter; who he meets while on assignment in 1942 Casablanca. The two marry, and have a child together in London, when the intelligence officer learns his new bride might be a German spy. The movie received mixed reviews from critics, and it was a disappointment at the Box Office. I found it to be a complete bore!The story is set in 1942, during World War II, when Max Vatan (Pitt), a Canadian intelligence officer, is sent to Casablanca to assassinate a German ambassador. Once there, Vatan teams up with a French Resistance officer, named Marianne Beausejour (Cotillard), and the two pose as a married couple in order to complete their mission. They're successful at killing the ambassador; and they also become very close, in the process. Vatan then asks Beausejour to come to London with him; where they then marry and have a daughter together. Everything appears to be going really well, until Vatan learns Marianne might be a German spy; and he's also informed that he might have to kill her.The film is so dry, and dull, that it was somewhat painful for me to have to sit and watch (and I don't feel that way about many movies). I usually thoroughly enjoy most of Zemeckis's films, but he really disappointed me here. Cotillard does what she can with her role, but Pitt is so lifeless, and quite bad in his part, that he brings Cotillard's performance down with him as well.

30,Lejink,Resistance is possible,5,10 March 2019,"Bet your life or bet your wife is the big question at the centre of this would-be World War 2 blockbuster thriller starring Brad Pitt and Marion Cotillard. Pitt plays a Canadian pilot who's the British Army's go-to guy for dangerous undercover missions. Cotillard is the French Resistance leader he encounters and has to partner in his latest assignment, a Heydrich-type assassination of the German ambassador in Casablanca. Of course you know that as soon as this good-looking couple say to each other that they'll determinedly resist any mutual physical attraction for fear of jeopardising their operation, the next minute they'll be making mad passionate love in a car in the middle of a sandstorm. Despite now by their own admission, being emotionally compromised, they still make like a wartime Mr and Mrs Smith and ruthlessly carry out their appointed task in loud, spectacular fashion.Mission accomplished and by now madly in love, the action switches to London as they settle down to domesticity, setting up home in Hampstead, getting married and having their first child, a daughter born, as you'd almost expect for this all-action couple, outside in the street while a German air-raid is raging all around them. Their ensuing cosy family life however is exploded by a tip-off to Pitt from on-high that his wonderful wife is in fact a German double-agent which sets in motion the final act where he finds out the truth about her, leading to a highly charged climax followed by a succeeding downbeat pastoral conclusion where all is explained.At heart, this is an old fashioned war-time melodrama where you can almost imagine Cary Grant and Ingrid Bergman in the two leads if it had been made way back in the 40's. That said, Pitt and Cotillard aren't the incomparable Mr Grant and Miss Bergman and I personally doubt whether Cary and Ingrid would have willingly signed-up to this too far-fetched feature. From its would-be dramatic opening scene of Pitt parachuting into the desert where you can see the CGI fakery and succeeding ""Lawrence Of Arabia"" panoramic shot right through to the shades of ""Gladiator"" ending, never mind the obvious nods to the original ""Casablanca"" of course, you can see the epic status for which director Robert Zemeckis is aiming but the film in the end just can't overcome its propensity for big, over-dramatic scenes and its too fantastic plot.",Allied

He's made some of the most beloved films of the last generation, but I feel as of late his work has been a bit tame and lack the inspiration to take the story the extra mile. It shows flares of classic wartime romance, but ultimately it's a letdown when considering the immense talent both on and off screen.Allied stars Brad Pitt (Max) and Marion Cotillard (Marianne) as lovers during World War II. The former is a spy and not much is really known about Cotillard, hence the main hook of the story. The trailer sells the movie as 'Mr. and Mrs. Smith' in the middle of a war. It's not necessarily the most original story, but the premise and talent involved was enough to get me in the theater. I think the biggest problem the film ran into is that if you have watched the trailer, you're waiting for the big moment to happen. By big moment, I mean the point in which Max begins to question his wife.So knowing that the entire first act is building towards a huge plot reveal made the first 40 minutes drag on. I was always engaged with what Pitt and Cotillard were doing but because the film is not written all that well, even they couldn't totally pull off flat dialogue. Taking that into consideration, it's difficult to truly care about the main characters in the climax, if you weren't all that into their romance in the first place. I tried hard to care about their relationship throughout the movie, but the park wasn't there.But Allied is far from a bad movie. With the exception of a few poor wide-green screen shots, Allied is beautifully shot. The cinematography and tone set by Zemeckis gives it the feel of an old- time Hollywood film. This particularly felt like something Humphrey Bogart and one of his brilliant co-leads like Katharine Hepburn, Lauren Bacall, or Ingrid Bergman would tackle together. But perhaps that's because it partially took place in Casablanca. Nonetheless, I certainly felt like I made the leap to wartime London.In all, Allied could have used a more polished script and inspired directing, but there's enough here to at least warrant a look.

The leading actors are great starting points, Brad Pitt as the Canadian dropping into Morocco and Marion Cotillard as his contact after his arrival. And here's the biggest problem right away—they have no real chemistry, and are actually not given much to work with (besides an absurd but fun love scene in a sandstorm).You get the feeling everyone is trying to outdo ""Casablanca"" itself, and they even start the movie there, just in case you don't feel the romance in the air. Robert Zemeckis is a storytelling director, so it's surprising this doesn't quite take off (blame the writer, in part?) but he's also not a lyrical film director. He depends on flash and surprise (as in ""Back to the Future,"" which is not a subtle film, whatever else it has that is brilliant).And in fact, ""Allied"" is an unsubtle film that needs some nursing along, some ambiance rather than over-the-top drama. (The birth scene will either be astonishing or laughable, depending on how involved in the movie you are. A little of both, maybe.) The story itself I think had great potential, but the actual screenplay dumbs it down.And if Cotillard is brilliant in her role (which she has to be, as you'll see), Pitt is a little wooden, downplaying the energy he might have brought to it. Here I suspect he's been told to channel Bogart with an understated intensity, and oddly enough, he just can't do it. (Blame the cinematography, a little, because as slick and beautiful as it is, it is also the work of an action flick mentality, rather than an actual romantic drama.)I watched it with real interest all the way and enjoyed many parts of it. I enjoyed even more anticipating what might be next, because there were a couple of plot twists at work. But each time I was a bit disappointed in what actually took place, the pulling of punches, or the sentimentalizing rather than dramatizing. When it was done, looking back, it seems like a stream of missed opportunities and imperfect scenes sandwiched between other moments that could have take us far.If the two of them had some actual chemistry in the first place.",Allied

38,Reno-Rangan,Marriage made in the field never work!,9,24 February 2017,"This is definitely among the top five films of the year. But the sad part is the Oscars snub. Nominated for Costume Design, but I expected the Best Actor, Actress, and particularly Original Screenplay and Motion Picture. This amazing spy thriller-drama was directed by Robert Zemeckis of many popular flicks. The best casting in the recent films and visually so good of those 40s atmosphere, like it be the war or the society.This is the story of two spies from different nation who meet in Casablanca for a mission. Pretending to be a newly wed couple, soon they enter the real wedlock. The rest of the tale follows a couple of years later when a big question arises, in that they have to prove their innocence. Failing it could lead them to a serious consequence. So the narration filled with suspense and thriller takes over with a greater pace till the end.Obviously the film was long, but I did not mind or I could say I did not know how the two hours went on so quickly. Engaging plot kept me my focus on the screen. As we know, all these years the Oscars turned down the best performance recognitions, including this one for Brad.Before going to watch this film, I thought it was another World War II film which might be inspired by the real. But it was not. Takes place in the background of the same war, but this is a spy film. And their personal life and profession, how one another influences is what revealed. Now I don't know when such kind of a great spy thriller I'm going to watch next. I think it is massively underrated, especially stupid film critics and their takes on it was unbelievably wrong. I surely, highly recommend it.9/10",Allied
39,sol-,Emotional War Scars,7,1 January 2017,"Living a normal, peaceful life proves impossible for an intelligence officer and the French Resistance fighter he married in this World War II drama from Robert Zemeckis. While a solidly made motion picture with good performances from Marion Cotillard and Brad Pitt, the film opened to mixed reviews, which is unsurprising given how misleading the trailers for the film are. From the trailers, one is positioned to expect a paranoia thriller centered around the question of whether or not Cotillard is an undercover spy, whereas in actuality this twist only occurs around halfway in. While this does admittedly lead to a second half that is more tense and exciting than the first half, the first half of the movie is still worthwhile as the dynamics between Cotillard and Pitt build amid a turbulent wartime setting; a birth scene during an air raid is particularly evocative. The film's denouement probably also contributed to the lukewarm critical response as it bares such a striking similarity to 'Casablanca' that it is impossible to avoid comparing the two films. Viewed as a motion picture on its own though, 'Allied' is just as an exciting an emotional roller-coaster ride as one would expect from a script by 'Dirty Pretty Things' and 'Eastern Promises' screenwriter Steven Knight. Pitt delivers a particularly fine turn as doubts and uncertainties cross his mind with more conveyed through his stares and sullen looks than words could ever offer. By the end, he comes across as a man indelibly affected by the tidings of war despite having never really fought at the frontlines himself.",Allied

Its plot was also a big surprise and it consisted of some plot twists that made even more interesting. The direction which was made by Robert Zemeckis was simply amazing and he did an excellent job on the way he presented his main characters and the story behind them. The interpretations of both Brad Pitt who played as Max Vatan and Marion Cotillard who played as Marianne Beauséjour were simply outstanding and their combination worked very well.

41,eddie_baggins,A pretty yet emotionless World War 2 thriller,5,23 February 2017,"Despite it's fine production values, A-list leads that do the best with what their given and a thrilling World War 2 set-up (on face value), Allied is an unfortunately dull, mature blockbuster that continues the recent Robert Zemeckis form slump that is showing no signs of ending anytime soon.A rightfully respected director who found fame by entertaining (Back to the Future), encapsulating hearts (Forest Gump) and drawing out terrific acting turns (Cast Away), the 2000's have seen Zemeckis lose his way with misguided CGI events like The Polar Express and lifeless spectacles such as The Walk, and while 2012's Flight had it's moments, many including myself had hoped Allied with it's potent setting and powerful leads was the film to once more bring out the best from the talented director.All lead up elements towards Allied's impending release seemed to suggest the World War 2 thriller, that pays homage to Hollywood productions of old (Casablanca often springs to mind) was set to be both an Oscar darling and an audience appealing event but working only mildly at the best of times as a spy thriller molded with a love story, Allied threatens more than once to become the film it could've been, whilst sadly ending up as the film it is.Failing to connect us emotionally to the story of Brad Pitt's Canadian spy Max Vatan and Marion Cotillard's European spy Marianne Beauséjour as they team up to take down evil Nazi's whilst low and behold falling head over heals in love, Zemeckis may find moments within his film that thrill but their mostly brief glimpses of set pieces that could've and really should've provided a lot more bang for buck.Scenes in Allied such as a bombing raid birth, a daring village mission or a sandstorm lovers sojourn all seem designed purely to enliven previously boorish lead-in scenes made worse by screenwriter Steven Knights' often cringe-worthy dialogue or heavily CGI'd production values, and even though Allied's leads share moments together where they light up the screen, this much documented pairing of Pitt and Cotillard won't exactly be setting the world on fire, with some of their moments as star crossed lovers feeling rather forced when it needed to be so much more.It's hard to know absolutely whether other actors placed in these roles could've elevated Allied's chances of success, but if this pairing can't make it work, clearly Allied has suffered from other damaging factors.There's a terrific film somewhere within Allied; a film we only sometimes catch. It should've been a thriller that moves us with its romance and races our hearts as the stakes are raised, but this pretty, yet emotionally cold production is forgettable and marks another so-so film from a director who knows how to do better but can't seem to find a heart and soul within his current crop of productions to do so.2 and a half pieces of bread out of 5",Allied
42,TheMovieDiorama,"Brad Pitt and Marion Cotillard join forces, to make a decent romance.",8,25 November 2016,"The usual November World War II film, this year we have Allied which is all about an undercover couple who eventually marry each other but a certain obstacle is thrown their way...British intel believes that the wife is actually a German spy. Is the intel wrong? Is it love over honour? Well you'll have to watch to find out for yourself, but I do recommend you do so as this is a good old fashioned romance, with a hint of spy thrills. I must advise that you do go in expecting a romance, the trailers did market this as a thriller/action...it is not. Right, firstly let's get the obvious out of the way and say that Marion Cotillard once again steals the film. She really is a class act. She is able to capture emotion through her face and not many actors can do that (plus we finally get to see her speak a lot of French which is great for her). Brad Pitt was great, although essentially used to be the bankable star and to get viewers to watch the film (ignoring the current affairs of his love life), he could've been replaced by anyone. Due to the old fashioned style, this needs a great director and who better than Robert Zemeckis (Forrest Gump, Castaway and Flight). He is so confident and has such a fascinating nostalgic way of using the camera. Such good camera placement particularly during a scene that involves mirrors from a wardrobe to show a different character...very clever and I admire that. The script however was hit or miss. At times I felt that the script was captivating, I definitely became invested in the couple and cared for what happens to them. The only problem is, there are several scenes which do not add to the story and actually creates pacing issues for itself which is a shame. Admittedly I'm not a huge fan of WWII period dramas but the production and overall environment for the film was excellent, I couldn't fault it. I won't spoil the ending but it did touch me and it was beautifully handled (although my partner actually did shed a tear, maybe I am emotionless after all). Overall, Allied was a decent romantic period drama with an incredible performance from Cotillard and outstanding direction from Zemeckis, although the script had inconsistent pacing.Review at: http://www.themoviediorama.com",Allied
43,imseeg,Very entertaining suspenseful and romantic world war II espionage drama.,7,18 November 2018,"""Allied"" is sometimes a bit slick and sentimental. Never too much though, but it shows that it is still a hollywood production. The acting is somewhat stiff at times. Those are my only 2 complaints, because overall this movie is very suspenseful and that suspense keeps this movie thrilling till the very end. But ""Allied"" needs a long build up. So please be patient, because there will come several very interesing plot turns, which take the movie into a totally different direction then I could have suspected.Brad Pitt fans will love this movie, especially the ladies will be pleased, because there is a lot of romance going on between Brad Pitt and Marion Cottilard, with her stunning puppy brown eyes. Naugthy detail:this is suppose to be the movie in which Brad Pitt had the alleged affair with Marion Cottilard on the movie set, which was the cause for the divorce from Angelina Jolie. Despite all the fuss about the alleged affair, the romance in the story makes this an ideal date movie. But guys could love this espionage thriller as well, because the suspense part is really smart and thrilling. It is not a full on action war movie though, but it has a few resistance action scenes. However the romance and espionage part is the main focus of the story of ""Allied"". Lots of (romantic) talk and espionage suspicion going on simultaneously. That mix works rather well...Although there (fortunately) isnt a hollywood happy end, the end doesnt give us viewers a big downer either.

44,paul-allaer,Is she or isn't she a German spy?,6,25 November 2016,"""Allied"" (2016 release; 124 min.) brings the story of Max and Marianne. As the movie opens, we are told this is ""French Morocco, 1942"", and Max parachutes into the desert. He is driven into Casablanca where he is to meet up with a French resistance fighter, Marianne, and they are to pretend to be husband and wife. ""Your wife will be wearing a purple dress"", the driver tells him. Max and Marianne immediately hit it off, whilst preparing for a dangerous mission to assassinate the German Ambassador. Following the mission, Max urges Marianne to join him in London and marry him.Couple of comments: this is the latest ""big Hollywood"" production from Oscar-winning director Robert Zemeckis. Here he tackles a WWII romantic drama starring Brad Pitt (as Max) and Marion Cotillard (as Marianne). If you've seen the movie's trailer (which has been inescapable if you've been to the movies in recent weeks), you already know that the movie pivots around one big twist: Marianne is suspected by the British intelligence service if being a spy for the Germans, and Max, in complete disbelief, is out to prove her innocence. So... is she or isn't she a spy? I'm not going to tell you of course. But I will say this: the accusation that she is a spy comes about half-way into the movie. In other words, if you've seen the trailer, it completely reveals the movie's first-half plot. I must say that I was pretty dismayed about that, as I felt I was wasting my time watching the first hour. The movie's production is outstanding and expensive-looking all the way, no details were overlooked or spared, and it is clear that the movie is going for a vibe similar to the classic ""Casablanca"" from 7+ decades ago. Marion Cotillard once again showcases her acting talent and proves she is truly one of the leading actresses of today's generation. Last but not least, there is a very fine orchestral score, composed by Alan Silvestri.""Allied"" opened wide over the Thanksgiving weekend.

45,robert-temple-1,Brad Pitt sleepwalks through an entire film,5,6 April 2017,"This film has a powerful story, many stunning scenes, and Marion Cotillard. But it also has Brad Pitt. Big mistake. Not only does Pitt seem to have had his face worked on, so that it can show little emotion anymore, but he is also apparently not Brad Pitt anymore. Is this a zombie who has taken his place? He plays opposite Marion Cotillard in countless intimate scenes, she tries every device she can think of to wake him up, but still he slumbers. A cardboard cutout of the Brad Pitt we used to know would have been more effective. Considering that this is a film wholly dependent upon the relationship between Pitt and Cotillard, the result is a disaster. The chemistry between them is so far below absolute zero that we are in a deeply frozen universe. Meanwhile, an enormous crew and the director Robert Zemeckis (famous for FORREST GUMP and BACK TO THE FUTURE) struggle to hold back the Red Sea so that the entire cast do not drown in a sea of indifference. We have the excellent Jared Harris, beloved of all MAD MEN fans, adding his resonant voice which is as soothing as hot chocolate, but lacking closeups, so that we can barely see him. We have Gary Sinese, an old chum of Zemeckis. We even have Simon McBurney. But still there is no thaw. We have great scenes. There is sex inside an old car in the middle of a sandstorm in the desert (lacking however any continuity link to the succeeding scenes, which is both an editing and a directing lapse). There is a birth of a baby in the open in the middle of an air raid. There is a man landing on a sand dune by parachute, seen from the air as he descends (astonishing camera work) which is ostensibly in Morocco but was really filmed in the Canary Islands, where all the North African locations were simulated. (There are in any case no such sand dunes near Casablanca, just for the record.) And there is a plane coming straight at a house but which misses its roof by a whisker and crashes across the street. That street is Willow Road in London's Hampstead, where so much action takes place. I could not make out whether the house was meant to be that of my friend Rupert Sheldrake, but I must go have a look at his roof to see whether it is damaged. Later when we see baby Anna taking her first steps, with the wrecked German plane in the background, it is on a hill far from Willow Road, but then this is only a movie. This is a film which should have been fantastic. But it has no pace, it is in fact languid and lingering. It is meant to be a powerful thriller and intense personal drama, but where is the editing to keep it going, where are the intense angles, and above all, where is the hero? Sound asleep, of course. Yes, there are plenty of spectacular setups. Many people worked their butts off giving us great sets, great props, great clothes, wonderful period cars. There are searchlights and anti-aircraft guns slaving away for our benefit, there are Sten guns, Nazis, stern 'V Section' spooks, uniforms, pistols, the whole shebang. But where are the pace, the intensity, and the excitement? All the elements are there, but we wait in vain for it all to move us. This is a passionless film. I also think Steven Knight's screenplay was greatly lacking in any true cinematic sense, and that he is just not a natural writer for the screen, despite having numerous credits. What a waste of a wonderful opportunity this is. And all that money spent on it! Zemeckis rolls scene after scene onstage as if he were producing a variety show in a theatre, or reading from Steven Knight's shopping list, and expects them all to adhere. But they are episodic rather than unified. We go from one outstanding setup to another. But we do not do so quickly enough, there is not enough glue, and above all, the nearest thing to a meaningful Pitt which we see in this film, vaguely and in the distance, are the ones on Jared Harris's face, remembered from MAD MEN, where we all learned to find them endearing marks of his individuality. Marion Cotillard deserves an Oscar for trying. But she might as well be kissing a film poster, and even a rag doll would be more responsive to her embraces. All of her plentiful allure is just so much water thrown at the desert sands, disappearing instantly and leaving no trace. If one pretends all the flaws are not there, one can still just about enjoy this film because of its dramatic and tragic story. But its lack of vigour just makes it look so contrived.",Allied
46,subxerogravity,Stunning picture with a glamorous feel and great story on Romance.,7,28 November 2016,"Overall,it's a pretty good movie.I just love the style of the picture. Generally that World War 2 era has that glamorous style to it, and leave it to Robert Zemeckis to add that extra kick.Although I've Seen better costumes but this maybe because Canada did not have the best uniforms out of the WWII crowd.And that made this movie strangely interesting. The 1st movie I ever seen about Canada's involvement in the War. Maybe I have seen others but it's so rare that it makes this movie seem unique that the story is about a Canadian wing commander who falls in love and builds a life with a woman who may not be all that she claims.Speaking of which, The best part of the movie is that drama. Though I love the art direction as it puts me in That WWII setting, the visual effects do a good job of placing you right there, but the drama coming from Brad Pitt and Marion Cotillard's connection on camera. It's this connection that's the most important and makes the movie what it is, and the emotion baggage is well worth it.So not much of a war epic or an espionage movie as I went to see if for but it's a great love story set perfectly and beautifully in a different time and place worthy of checking out.",Allied
47,Turfseer,Famed director's homage to WW II classic spy thrillers proves entertaining but lugubrious with a not so believable plot,5,24 July 2018,"Poor Brad Pitt! Like his heartthrob predecessor before him, Paul Newman, he bitterly resents the eye candy appellation bestowed upon him by millions of star-struck women worldwide. As a reaction formation, he has consistently been determined to prove that he's a legitimate actor and seeks out roles that suggest at his deepest core, that he has ""heart.""
 Here he's playing Canadian RAF wingman turned spy, Max Vatan, parachuting into 1942 French Morocco (specifically Casablanca) under the auspices of British intelligence. The mission is to hook up with the French Resistance agent, Marianne Beauséjour (famed French actress Marion Cotillard) and assassinate the German ambassador.
 Veteran famed director Robert Zemeckis (Back to the Future, Forrest Gump) along with screenwriter Steven Knight have fashioned an homage to the grand old War War II espionage thrillers of yesteryear, specifically the Humphrey Bogart-Ingrid Bergman classic, Casablanca, as well as perhaps Hitchcock's Notorious, featuring Cary Grant teamed up with the ubiquitous Bergman. Notably, the city of Casablanca receives Zemeckis' rather squeaky clean, art deco makeover that will impress those who yearn for some heady nostalgia.
 Unfortunately, the first half of Allied proves not only lugubrious but rather unconvincing plot-wise. There's the whole problem of Max's non-Parisian accent which Marianne is convinced she can help improve in a week's time-enough to fool a coterie of unsuspecting Germans they are required to deceive. Not buying it!
 Worse is the mission itself. What good can come from knocking off the German Ambassador? Can't the Germans simply replace him? And killing Germans seems to be a rather easy feat in Vichy controlled Casablanca. Before the big assassination scene, Max chokes a German officer to death in a bathroom believing that he's encountered him before (fearing his cover might be blown). No manhunt ensues and presumably, none of the witnesses came forward to place Max and Marianne at the scene.
 We later find out in the second half that the German Ambassador was some sort of ""dissident"" and the assassination was ordered by Hitler himself, with Max as a dupe and (SUPER SPOILERS AHEAD) Marianne acting as a double agent for the Germans. If you believe it you also have to believe that Hitler was willing to sacrifice dozens of German soldiers to keep up the pretense, after Max and Marianne rather conveniently mow them all down with machine guns they surreptitiously (and again rather easily) brought to the Ambassador's residence.
 The ""meat"" of the story is only introduced in the second half of the film when Max is informed by the super-secret V-section of British intelligence that they believe Marianne is a double agent. They devise a test where Max receives classified information and writes it down on a notepad after receiving a call from them in the middle of the night. If the info pops up from intercepted German communications in the next few days, that's proof that Marianne is a spy who culled it from Max's notepad.
 The ugly revelation propels Max to find a way to disprove the more than dispiriting allegations. By now it's established that Max and Marianne are truly in love, having produced a child within a year's time after they've returned to London. Many critics have decried a lack of chemistry between the principals and it's probably because Max is too taciturn of a character to believe he's fallen completely head over heels for the far more emotional Marianne. Screenwriter Knight attempts to establish the existence of a strong bond between the two through an early lovemaking scene in a sandstorm prior to the couple's return to London, where perhaps anxiety over constant Nazi buzz bomb attacks is enough to suggest a deep love connection.
 Knight is much more successful in the denouement when he finally affords Pitt the opportunity to become much more animated and emotive. Max, against orders, flies to France to question Delamare, a former spy now imprisoned in a Vichy jail, who is the only one who can disprove that Marianne is working for the Germans. He notes he saw her play La Marseilles on the piano a few years before so, in the film's second most dramatic scene, Max brings her to a pub and insists that she play the song on a piano there.
 Of course, she's unable to do so, proving indeed she's been a double agent all along. Max, still in love with her, wants to escape to Switzerland and drives to the air base with her and baby in tow. Marianne insists that she's been in love with Max since Casablanca and basically argues that her handlers forced her (by threatening to harm her child) to continue with her spy activities.
 The climax is actually kind of touching with Marianne committing suicide and Max's friend Colonel Frank Heslop (Jared Harris) preventing Max from being court-martialed after he failed to follow orders to kill Marianne had he learned she was a spy. It's a little too late, but Pitt shows his ""heart"" as much later he becomes the father who raised a daughter, who never knew her mother (Cotillard gets to read a dramatic, emotional letter she writes to the daughter a day before she kills herself).
 Allied is reasonably entertaining despite the lugubrious pacing and not so believable plot machinations early on. See it for Cotillard's intense performance. As for Pitt, give him a ""B"" for effort, despite being saddled with such a taciturn role.",Allied

And, looking at her on IMDB, I've actually seen her more than I thought I had.At any rate, she blends well with the era...but, unfortunately, Pitt looks less from the times than he did in his other WWII movies, which is odd given how he can blend as well. I guess the producers wanted to feature him more for the draw of Brad Pitt.In either case, it is a suspenseful and emotional film and one that will sit among the better spy movies ever made. It's low key, the action and the violence is down played to the point where it's far removed from Bond and comes across as a very straight spy thriller.In other words it's the type of movie we unfortunately don't see enough of these days, subtle and straight. It's a movie that is based around the characters, the script, and the acting more than special effects and because of that it's easy to get involved emotionally with the plot and the people, even if it does move a bit faster than I would have liked.Overall, it's a breath of fresh air in the era of the MCU and over-the-top effects and it pays off in the end from pure emotion.

The premise of the film sees two secret agents fall in love when one of them is accused of being a spy. Brad Pitt is the lead in his film and he does a very good job in this film, he is charming When he needs to be and is tough when he needs to be. You buy his character as he goes through the journey of this film you attempt to feel sympathy for his character and the situation. Marion cotillard plays his wife in this film and she does a good job in the film. You see her character development through the film and her character does grow and become more interesting as the film progresses. I also feel her and Pitt worked well together. But the rest of the supporting cast had absolutely no purpose to them and you won't care about them even when the film tries to do so. The story has an interesting dynamic between the two leads which does create an interesting mystery in the film. Unfortunately, the first half of the film feels like a completely different film and the shift in storytelling makes it feel disjointed and hard to care about certain things in the film. The script has some great dramatic dialogue as you see the two characters develop throughout the film. But this is a very lifeless affair with no humour at all and some of the smaller dialogue and moments feel very weak and bland that hurts the overall product.

The trailer leads you to think that this film is something that it kind of is and on the other hand kind of isn't. It's difficult to explain without spilling certain key aspects. But overall Allied is a 7/10, if you happen to miss it then it isn't the end of the world, but I do think it is worth seeing, but definitely see other better ones first, like Arrival!!!!",Allied
56,myriamlenys,"worth watching, but only once",6,7 October 2017,"The Pitt - Cotillard duo works well and shows considerable chemistry. Cotillard, one of the most beautiful women in movies, lights up the screen with enough charm and sensuality to tempt an eremite saint, aided and abetted by one of the most exquisite wardrobes seen these last years. (I do hope that someone got an Oscar for the costumes. The wedding dress alone deserves a place in a museum.)However, it might have been better if some of the imagination and care lavished on the costumes had been spared for other aspects. The movie, for all its burning airplanes and multicolored explosions, isn't all that gripping, thrilling or moving. It isn't even all that convincing. For instance : try wrapping your head around the idea of seasoned intelligence and counterintelligence officers going on about top secret matters while surrounded by a loud and chaotic party of the more bohemian kind. Who discusses capital secrets within possible earshot of unsuccessful young poets trying to pour cheap sherry down your neck ? Moreover, it's a pretty good bet that such people didn't discuss crucial safety matters with their sisters, however sensible or brave or patriotic these sisters may have been. Still, we should all be thankful that the depiction of intelligence work isn't all that realistic : if the various Allied espionage and counterespionage services had thought and behaved like that in real life, then the swastika flag would be flying in every country from Arctica to Antarctica... Fun note : the linguists among you can enjoy a wide range of accents and pseudo-accents, some of which are so unhinged that they belong in a psychiatric ward. Sadly this fact doesn't count towards an extra star, although the line about ""Your French is good, but your accent isn't Parisian enough"" is comedy gold.",Allied
57,aharmas,Who is That French Woman?,9,4 December 2016,"Marion Cotillard is at the center of the storm, and she gives a very commanding and puzzling performance. She's mysterious, dangerous, and showing how she's fully capable of creating a enticing web of appeal and possible deceit, or isn't she? She's excellent in ""Allied"", but I would dare say Pitt steals the show by trying to keep up with her character's doings and Cotillard's fine acting. He's challenged and delivers.Pitt plays Max, a Canadian air force spy who is sent on a mission to Morocco to eliminate a target. Along the way, she teams up with Monica (Cotillard) and eventually become the perfect team both professionally and in their civilian life. Everything seems to be working until the day a blip shows up in the intelligence of the RAF and things begin to unravel when Max must find out what is really happening with his wife.Pitt and Cotillard have a different type of chemistry on screen. They're intellectual. She's not Sharon Stone, but she's feminine and classy, enticing with enough of a mystery to keep everyone guessing. She's a prize. Pitt is a more simple individual, but that makes him more dangerous and vulnerable at the same time because he's unable to see gray areas, which might be his undoing. She sees her as innocent and tries his best to clear her name. It's her nature and the aura of mystery that causes him sink into despair because it's just not possible that someone that lovely can be so dark.Cotillard takes us and bewitches us from the beginning. She's playing a darker version of the alluring and romantic Elsa in ""Casablanca"". There are many tributes in this film to that classic. When you see the costumes and the settings you will notice what's happening, but Cotillard is more earthly, and we tend to suspect her from the beginning. Elsa was a romantic, a more dangerous type. Cotillard is too normal, and we don't know what to think. She's also too smart for us to dare cross her, and Max knows that, too.It the end, it all comes together logically, giving us a satisfying conclusion. The parallels to ""Casablanca"" continue, except that's also where events really differ. ""Allied"" is a good combination of exotic settings, interesting characters, and old-fashioned action with a couple of moments when we realize that it's not all about a simple love story, but that there's some relevance to the setting and the period.Go and enjoy.",Allied
58,s3276169,A classic take on the 40's romantic spy thriller....,7,27 January 2017,"Allied offers up a classically styled, 40's romantic spy thriller.This is very much a ""by the numbers"" flick. That's not to say its a bad film but it has been done before and as such, its rather predictable from beginning to end. At least for veteran movie goers. Did I enjoy it? Yes I did. And, I guess that's the best litmus test of any film. Its a polished affair, with quality sets, effects and a top notch cast. At times, its a little syrupy but not enough to make you feel queasy. I will say, the overall premise is a little thin but its not so thin, as to be wholly unconvincing. In short, Allied is a competent film but by no means an exceptional one. Seven out of ten from me.",Allied
59,dierregi,"Classy story of war, spying, love and family",8,1 December 2016,"A Franco/Canadian secret mission is an unusual twist for a WWII story. This and the setting of the first part of ""Allied"" reminded me of ""The English Patient"". Canadian Max (Pitt) is sent to Casablanca for a dangerous mission. Marianne (Cotillard) is the French agent already in place to help him.Out of the desert and in London, ""Allied"" moves into a different territory, albeit still with plenty of style. Max and Marianne's wartime romance in exotic settings turns into a real family, but doubts arise about Marianne's identity.London during the war as the main setting for two thirds of the movie looked very realistic. I did not mind what could be the historical inaccuracy of the Blitz, because the bombing added a layer of drama to the story.I particularly liked the scene during the party, with Sing, Sing Sing playing in the background. It is a slightly menacing tune and it complemented perfectly the atmosphere of tension, suspicion and slight desperation.Even if I have never been a Brad Pitt fan, he did a good job playing quiet Max, a man of a few words who sees his new world disintegrating. One can easily imagine him as a long-term bachelor falling for the beautiful, brave French partisan. Cotillard was also convincing as the ambiguous ""femme fatale"". Contrary to what some reviewers wrote, plenty of chemistry between the two, but also tenderness.If you like movies with a solid plot, linear storytelling, believable characters, difficult choices, great costumes and soundtrack, then you should like this.P.S. couple of remarks: Pitt's French was not the best and no way he could have passed for Parisian, but that did not bother me too much. The final scene is a couple of minutes too long, but again, not a major problem. However, what a relief to follow a good plot without the zig- zagging in time, overused but often useless editing style.",Allied
60,davidmvining,A Mature Wartime Drama that Marketing spoiled,10,1 December 2020,"There are some Robert Zemeckis movies that really shouldn't be spoiled before watching them. Cast Away and What Lies Beneath were a couple, and it's safe to add Allied to that list. Yet the trailers for all of them simply gave everything away. That's a conscious decision on the part of Zemeckis and the marketing teams in order to try and sell the movie to a broad audience and attract them, I get it, but there are surprises and turns to these movies that would be better enjoyed cold. A lot of that has to do with the talent and narrative investment that Zemeckis brings to every film, creating stories that strive to stand apart from the pack with depth and ingenuity.I love Allied, having seen it twice, considering it one of Zemeckis' most underappreciated works, but gosh darn it, would it have killed him to not reveal that Marion Cotillard was suspected of being a German spy in the trailer? There is only the barest of hints of such a possibility in the first hour of the film, the sorts of little details that only those who are rewatching the film or those on the keen lookout for any detail that goes against the grain would pick up on to indicate that such a possibility exists. Without that kind of outlook, those details could pass by in the opening in Casablanca with nary a notice and the reveal in the second act that drives the second half of the film could sit as a purer surprise.Anyway, Canadian flight officer and spy Max gets dropped into French Morocco where he is to play the part of husband to the French spy Marianne. They instantly fall into their parts but without ever forgetting that they are playing parts. There's a tension about any potential emotional connection between them and their work brought on by the idea that people in their profession don't mess up because they have sex but because they feel, and yet they're both attractive people in a dangerous profession where any day could be their last. Their mission is to kill the German ambassador to French Morocco and hopefully escape with their lives. In a tense and well-made scene, they do just that, but the feelings have erupted between them and they can't deny it. After a three week background check that keeps Marianne out of England in the middle of the war, she gets her approval to move to England for the wedding. Together in wartime London, they begin a family with Max riding a desk instead of out in the field.Up until this point, the movie has been a solid telling of a wartime romance with underpinnings of intrigue, but it's at the halfway point with the reveal that Marianne could be a German spy that things really turn. It's here that things begin to feel more like a traditional Zemeckis film with Max gaining a very specific goal, proving Marianne's innocence, that drives his every action through to the end. V-Section, Britain's Secret Intelligence Service, may be all but convinced of Marianne's guilt through a few scraps of information including the assertion that the real Marianne died in Paris several years earlier to the point that they set up a blue dye operation that Max must participate in and complete with Marianne's execution if she's guilty, but Max isn't going to just wait around for the results. He asks questions of those who might know, finding dead ends, he asks a young pilot to get an answer from a Frenchman only to have the young pilot killed because he waits too long after dropping off his payload for the resistance. Max even goes so far as to take that same flight himself to get the answer from the Frenchman in a wonderfully tense scene set at night.What ends up making this movie work so well is that second half. There's enough doubt about Marianne's loyalties considering things she had said to Max in the past and the pieces of information dolled out by V-Section and the Frenchman as well as some small things that Max sees himself that a tension brews about whether Max will be right or not in his assertion that Marianne is free from guilt. I think this may point to some of the critical complaints about the movie. Going in with the trailers in one's mind, you know that Marianne is going to be suspected, so you spend the first half waiting for it to get revealed and the second half finally feeling like the movie is catching up with the audience. This mindset seems to undermine the efficacy of everything that happens in the film for some, but I've never felt like marketing should affect my opinion of a film itself. I try to treat the opening frames of the movie like the first thing I've seen of the film.Allied is the work of a very skilled technical director working from an intelligent and tense script by Steven Knight. Paced steadily with an eye towards character and intrigue, the film is a quality addition to a strong filmography.",Allied
61,rgkarim,Pitt and Cotillard are quite the Allied Pair,7,26 November 2016,"Robbie K back again to bring you another movie review. This morning we discuss the latest ""Thriller"" called Allied starring Brad Pitt and Marion Cotillard. Based on the trailers, this movie was supposed to be the best Thriller of the year, but we know advertisements can hype things up every once in a while. As always, I'm here to share my thoughts and help guide your movie watching preferences. Let's get started. LIKES:  The recreation of World War 2 era  Acting Chemistry  Emotionally powerfulI always love when Hollywood use their budgets to design a breathtaking setting. Allied's production team accomplishes the goal of recreating a World War 2 era European theater that drops you back in time to the culture of the 1940s. For historical buffs, you'll enjoy the atmosphere the various settings the cast has selected for you, many of which establish the romantic atmosphere and amp up the emotion. Watching how spies worked without our modern technology was kind of cool, especially the intelligence involved in uncovering enemy secrets. It's beautiful, it's intelligent, and it's kind of cool. However, not everyone goes to a movie for a good setting, but perhaps you go to ogle/appreciate your favorite actor/actress. Well Allied has you covered on this movie as well. Brad Pitt, despite all the media, portrays the spy quite well bringing elegance, distraught and romance to his role. Marion Cotillard has a little more diversity in her character having to play suave, sophistication, love, and suspicion all in one package. While alone these two are solid, the true magic is in their chemistry. These two sold it to me that they were in real love, not that fake, overacted bologna you see in most films. There tears, the way they presented the dialogue, and even the physical act was convincing that these two had the hots for each other. Fans looking for a powerful film about love and testing the borders of trust are going to love much of this movie, especially the emotionally packed climaxes. I can't say much more without ruining the twists so let's move on, shall we?DISLIKES:  Not that exciting/thrilling  SlowThe biggest dislike for me is that for a Thriller this movie wasn't that thrilling to this reviewer. When seeing the trailers, the editors portrayed deep mystery, involving Pitt trying to uncover his wife's secrets without leading her on. I expected scenes of intense snooping where he is nearly discovered, or a convoluted plan to help catch the rat in the line of work. Hate to ruin this for you, but it wasn't anything like that for me. The plan is very simple (though realistic) and takes little effort from Pitt to execute. This boring approach sets up a three-day time limit in an effort add a little more flare to the heated emotion. While this is good in terms of character development, it is disappointing to not see the potential of the trailers unleashed in this movie, especially as we have lacked a good spy film in quite some time. And as for the action component of this film, this too is realistic, but also simplified into a few heated bouts that you have seen in the trailers. As you can guess, the lack of suspense and exciting battles makes this movie a bit slow. This was especially true in the scenes where everyone was talking in technical jargon to sound like a spy, which sometimes came off corny than inspiring. On a minor tangent, the use of subtitles was a little inconsistent, so brush up on your French if you want to understand the entire dialogue of the film. I found myself fighting sleep in a few of these drier moments, actually hoping for more romance and family scenes to relieve me of these sometimes-unnecessary moments. Of course, if I'm really wishing for something, I wished that there was more action integrated into the mix as well, but no surprise from me right. The VERDICT:Allied certainly is one of the better romantic movies I've seen in a while. It's plot and great acting supports the portrayal of true love, and the extremes you'll go to protect it. Our directors certainly hit the mark in portraying the madness involved with deciding loyalty to your country over your wife. Unfortunately, they misunderstood the word ""thrill"" in Thriller and took out the suspense and edge the trailers painted. So, is it worth a trip to the theater? For the acting and romantic crowd, yes I think it is, but as a whole this movie is better left to RedBox rentals in my opinion. My scores are:Action/Drama/Romance: 7.5 Movie Overall: 6.5",Allied
62,richard-1787,Skip this movie,4,6 December 2016,"I just wasted nearly 2 hours watching this movie in the theater. (I'm  doing work on the French Resistance, so I wanted to see how a French  Resistance fighter was portrayed.) To spare you from doing the same,  I'll explain here why I felt that it was a waste of time.  First, to be fair, I'll mention what was good: the cinematography was  often very impressive, especially in the few scenes out in the Moroccan  desert. The scene where Pitt and Cottillard first make love, in a car  in a sandstorm in the desert, though very far-fetched, is shot in an  interesting way.  Also, the effort to be historically accurate with the settings,  fashions, etc., I appreciated - though there were several things in the  plot that did not seem accurate at all, such as the general acceptance  of a lesbian couple in England during the War - remember ""The Imitation  Game""? The acting is also fine, in particular Marian Cottillard's. We  have no idea why Brad Pitt's character seems indifferent to woman - and  I mean really indifferent - in the first part of the movie. But  suddenly, for no particular reason, that changes.  So then, what's wrong with this movie? The script!!! The plot! To say  that it is full of far-fetched events is a severe understatement.  The alleged hero, Brad Pitt's character, is indifferent to the lives he  destroys in his efforts to ignore the rules and have things his own  way. We learn that, because of those efforts, a young pilot is killed  in France - an event that causes Pitt's character no visible remorse.  We shouldn't have been surprised, I suppose. When Pitt's character,  earlier in his efforts, sees that he caused another soldier to be left  almost sightless, he once again displayed no remorse. At the end, in a  scene that invites a very unfavorable comparison with 'Casablanca', he  too finds himself at an airfield with the woman he loves, knowing that  soldiers are on the way to try to capture him and her. But does he  decide to sacrifice his personal feelings for his country and the war  effort, like Humphrey Bogart's Rick Blaine? No, he wants to flee  England, to desert the British army, so that he can spend the rest of  his life in hiding with his love. It is all about self and ego.  We are also asked to forgive a German spy who has also caused the  deaths of Allied soldiers, because she really loves her Canadian  husband, even though she was too stupid to let him in immediately on  the German attempt to force her to keep spying.  Why should we care about two characters who care about no one but  themselves and their own feelings, and don't mind sacrificing innocent  others to them? The fact that they are in love - a very egotistical  love - does not excuse their treatment of others.  This is what was once referred to as a ""woman's picture"" - love is more  important than patriotism, loyalty, duty, etc. - but that is predicated  on the idea that women automatically forgive anything and everything  for love. Which, of course, is insulting to women.",Allied
63,Movie-ManDan,Surprisingly Bad.,4,27 August 2017,"It's been a long time since there has been a decent movie with war in the backdrop. We've been getting lots of ""Hacksaw Ridges"" and ""The Hurt Lockers"" where the battles are first and foremost but very little human greatness outside of the battlefield. If there have been recent movies with war in the backdrop, they are too far in the back to be remembered. Robert Zemeckis' Allied looked like it would be and ode to Casablanca and have the war in the just right spot. Well, it tried, and it failed.Brad Pitt plays a Canadian resistance dude assigned to Casablanca, Morocco. The year is 1942 and I thought it would have been awesome of there was an allusion to the old film. I really wanted Marion Cotillard to say ""Rick Blaine has letters of transit,"" or Pitt say ""I have a meeting with Victor Lazlo."" That would have been awesome. So Brad is paired with Marion Cotillard on a mission to assassinate a German ambassador. Posing as husband and wife, both people get to know each other and live the part out for awhile. The romance is pretty shallow, like when James Bond romances a girl. That's the level that this movie achieves.After the assassination, they get married in real life and have a child. A year passes and Pitt is told that his wife is a German spy. He is determined to prove them wrong and get to the bottom of it. This second act is indeed better than the first. It is interesting to see Pitt investigate his wife's mysterious past. But again, this never reaches the full potential. There was so much room in so many places for so many smart twists and turns. What results is a super generic explanation with the journey to the truth only being interesting, not awesome.Perhaps it would have been better if the characters were developed better. All we get to know is that Brad is Canadian and Marion Cotillard is a German with a past. Boom! I just told you everything you need to know about the characters.Are there any good things? Sure. The action is good and production design are all top notch. And, as I said, the investigating is interesting. But none of these could have saved an overall bad movie with an even worse ending.2/4",Allied
64,bkrauser-81-311064,"Flaccid, Boring and Obvious",6,9 December 2016,"I'm not sure which is worse: a bad story made passable by impossibly qualified talents or the fact that said talents thought something this dated and superfluous could have been a homerun. The feel of Allied is downright quixotic. It's an English Patient (1996) knockoff with the look of a cheap wartime propaganda movie starring the closet thing we have to classic Hollywood stars playing our leads. The story itself creaks with outdated maudlin clichés while the camera traverses each moment like it's trying to draw attention to itself but none of what it captures catches the eye. I realize that director Robert Zemeckis is the Amblin wunderkind that churned out Back to the Future (1985) but couldn't we have please left this outmoded way of making films in the past?Pitt and Cotillard play fellow spies Max Vatan and Marianne Beausejour, called into service during the onslaught of WWII. Beausejour has spent years in the French underground gaining a reputation for being as unscrupulous and deadly as she is beautiful. Meanwhile Vatan an agent forwhatever Canada's equivalent is for the CIA, drops from the sky and assimilates into the Vichy intrigue of Casablanca. From there they pair off, fall in love, move to England and, as you can no doubt gleam from the trailer, Vatan and company begin to suspect Beausejour of being an Axis double agent.The film is divided almost perfectly in half between our duos mission and eventual courtship in Morocco, and the percolating intrigue back at HQ. So much of the film's stock is governed by the tension created by Beausejour's situation in the second half that it's amazing the film takes so long to get there. Once we finally get there however, the movie tips its hat one too many times all but giving away the game before it even begins. So many of the scenes shot in the English countryside are shot through mirrors (a Zemeckis staple that hammers in the idea of someone being two-faced). The dialogue rehashes moments from the first half of the film as if to create a cleaver-than-thou echo; and if you're not already primed for the plot twist, at one point Beausejour is reading Brighton Rock. That in congress with the fact that her name is a French double f***ing entendre you just have to assume she's not telling the whole story.It's so mind-boggling how a movie of such pedigree can be so flaccid and obtuse yet there it is, still in theaters and still selling the faces of its two leads like their Leigh and Olivier. Look forward to this uneven little spy thriller to be cobbled into a four pack with Red Tails (2012), Defiance (2008) and Valkyrie (2008) because that's the only way spending money on this would be a smart buy.",Allied
65,tomsview,Memories of Rick and Ilsa,7,2 May 2017,"Although at first it looked like a cross between ""Casablanca and ""Inglourious Basterds"", ""Allied"" soon settles into an unusual and compelling romance.To enjoy this film set in WW2 you just have to go with it. During an operation in Casablanca, Canadian Max Vatan (Brad Pitt), a British Intelligence agent, falls in love with a beautiful French resistance fighter, Marianne Beauséjour (Marion Cottillard). Back in England they marry and have a baby. However, it turns out she could be a spy. And so it goes until an ending that leaves Brad about as desolate as he was in ""Se7en"".The film attempts to capture the feeling of those romantic adventure films that were actually made during WW2; films it must be said that were as much removed from reality as this one is. When Max fakes his way onto a plane to pop over to Nazi Occupied France to prove a point, it's not too far removed from the sort of thing Errol Flynn got up to in war movies back in the 1940's.Brad is fine as the secret service agent although the script allows for a very cavalier approach to the supposedly secret stuff. However, along with Brad's style and charisma, Marion Cotillard's stillness and presence give ""Allied"" that big movie feel that elevates it from other WW2 dramas such as ""Foyles War"". Even if Max and Marianne don't quite reach the emotional heights of Rick and Ilsa, by the halfway mark we care what happens to them.Director Robert Zemeckis' composer of choice, Alan Sylvestri, contributed an atmospheric and emotive score. It has a more modern vibe than the sounds of those films of the 1940's with their wall-to-wall orchestral scores by maestros such as Steiner, Waxman, and Rozsa.Zemeckis wrings every drop of emotion out of his films – ""Contact"", ""Castaway"", ""Forrest Gump"" – and so he does with ""Allied"". Despite the implausibilities, the powerful love story drives the film.",Allied

Most importantly: Who cares?It has all the surface accoutrements of a decent spy film... but the one major element it lacked for me was authenticity, which is quite important in espionage!I never for one second believed that these big movie stars were the characters they played, even when all cover was dropped, and they were striving for genuine emotion... An expensive storefront window with nothing of value behind it, this is Pitt's version of Jolie's ""The Tourist"" - lavish, and pointlessly hollow... (although I enjoyed ""The Tourist"", at least, since it made no pretense at being anything BUT flighty).I expected better from Zemeckis, but too long spent in the uncanny valley of Motion-Capture Land has obviously dulled his senses, and left him unable to inject real soul into a movie that's ostensibly grounded in reality.",Allied

68,Troy_Campbell,Beautiful but muddled.,6,21 December 2016,"Brad Pitt. Marion Cotillard. Robert Zemeckis. There's no shortage of top-tiered talent for this WWII romantic thriller, in which Pitt's Canadian military officer falls in love with Cottilard's French revolutionist during an assassination mission in Casablanca. But how much can he really trust her? That's the question that simmers away throughout proceedings, albeit with a frustrating lack of subtlety, until taking centre stage in the last half of the movie. It's a shame that Steven Knight's script leans so heavily on the thriller aspect of the plot, as the uncomplicated love story displayed in the opening act was, in large part due to the chemistry between the leading duo, more exciting and interesting then anything in the final stretch. The film doesn't hide its influences — Casablanca, Dr. Zhivago, etc — which is admirable, however the vintage wartime-romance tone that is borrowed from those classics is spoiled by spliced in scenes of CGI-heavy action. And whilst the central couple are compelling, the entire supporting cast are disappointingly underdeveloped giving the likes of Jared Harris, Lizzy Caplan (whose role in particular is completely absurd) and Matthew Goode little to work with. All that negativity aside, however, there are still many worthy elements that ensure this remains a largely satisfying motion picture, not least Don Burgess' beautiful cinematography; every shot is captured so gorgeously it could be framed and mounted on a wall. There are also some one-off moments of brilliance: the first time our lovers meet is tense and electric, a quiet piano-based confrontation between them is heartbreaking, and the rain-drenched airstrip finale is powerfully affecting. Allied undoubtedly fails to fully capitalise on the star-studded cast and crew, but is nevertheless a decent tale of love, deceit and sacrifice.",Allied
69,blumdeluxe,Thrilling with too much Hollywood,7,9 January 2017,"What if you'd be faced with the question if the love of your life is trustworthy out of the blue? That's what ""Allied"" asks us. It tells us the story of a Canadian soldier, who worked against the Nazi regime in Morocco and fell in love with the french agent that helped him doing so. Back home, they soon get married and a family but everything could be at risk when unappealing questions about the past begin to arise.This movie offers us a real nightmarish scenario, a reality in which we don't know anymore who can be trusted. It thus carries great potential to tell a different story of the war, a very individual one. While in my opinion, Allied is definitely a great movie, what prevents me from giving it the full stars is that at times, especially during the end, everything just seems to be a bit too unreal, too Hollywood for me to take it as granted. I wonder if a bit more of an art-house approach could have benefited the movie, but now that's speculations.A movie worth watching, but not a must-see for me.",Allied
70,antoniotierno,Barely watchable romantic drama,6,18 January 2017,"This key plot twist takes almost an hour to occur and it's only at this point that things really kick into gear. Ahead of this the film struggles to take off thanks to Pitt and Cotillard's inability to spark off one other. Brad Pitt is cool through the first half of the film and Cotillard is charming, but as a pair they really don't work. They're not aided by a distinct lack of thrills in the first half, despite them staging a daring assassination in enemy territory. On the other side of the plot twist, things improve dramatically. The tension increases as there is more at stake, the married Max and Marianne have far more chemistry, with performances getting even better.

75,rockman182,Allied (2016),6,26 January 2017,"Robert Zemeckis is a good director who has been streaky as of late. He has some work that I really like but in recent years he's been forgettable. Judging by the trailers I wasn't very excited for this film. After viewing the film, I'll say that its better than I expected but could have been far better. Its still worth a watch and others may champion the picture more than I will.Marion Cotillard. What more can I say? I am so glad this extremely talented French actress switched over to American cinema. She's fantastic and magnetic in this film (as she always is). Two Days, One Night is a stellar film in which she showcases her talents. She does everything right in this film as well. I think the film could have been written better, but her character is still full of a sexual mystique and you watch as her truth unfolds. Although mysterious, her character is fulfilled and her relationship with Pitt on screen is charming. Pitt is also great in the film, the acting wasn't ever going to be a let down with these two.The plot progression is slow. I think once you get to the point where Marianne is accused of being a spy, the film picks up. Prior to that attention wanes, minds wander. There is action on the screen and the plot stays busy but feels lifeless at times. This is not a fault of the actors but seems like writing that doesn't provoke at large stages. This might have to do with the film focusing more on romance during wartime than being an espionage thriller. I think it could have used more of the latter to make for a more memorable experience. There are moments which are good but I felt like the film was uneven.Characters come and go, outside of the two leads everyone else is fleeting, not memorable, or just there to advance the plot. There's talent there like Matthew Goode and Lizzy Caplan but you don't really care about them because they are not around for long enough. Stuff just happens and lots of the film just feels tame and not as gripping as you'd expect from a World War II spy film. The film needed more suspense to really captivate the viewers but goes off on some tangents. I'm not saying the actors were wasted as the film isn't bad, its just that with better writing everything would have thrived. This one doesn't stack up to Zemeckis' best but its stylish, well acted, and has costumes and set pieces that take your eyes into a setting from WWII, although your mind is left to wander.6/10",Allied
76,rps-2,Superb!!!,10,18 August 2017,"The Netflix summary sounded like it might be a good movie so we brought it up. It is a SUPERB movie that captures the atmosphere of world war II with powerful staging and creative cinematography. Basically it is the story of a Canadian-British spy who falls in love with his French partner in espionage who might just be a double agent. (I'll never tell whether she was.) I was dismayed to see the long list of errors on the IMDb page, such things as non-contemporary door locks, misplaced deserts and inappropriate salutes. Usually I'm a stickler for such things. But this movie is so great, they don't really matter. You'll be riveted to your chair for its two hour plus running time. The plot is almost operatic.

77,bankofmarquis,Mostly good,7,30 November 2016,"Don't be fooled by the trailers for the new World War II film, ALLIED.  These trailers make it look like an action/war movie.  it is not.  Allied is, at it's heart, a love story with the action of WWII as it's background which would explain why it is starring Brad Pitt and Marion Cotillard.Directed by Robert Zemeckis (Forrest Gump, Back to the Future), the first half of ALLIED tells the tale of two spies (Pitt and Cotillard) who are assigned to pose as a married couple in Casablance in order to assassinate a high-ranking German official.  During this mission, the two fall in love and head back to live happily ever after in war- torn London.The 2nd half of the movie is what happens after ""happily ever after"".This is a tale of two films, the first half and the 2nd half, and - for me - the 2nd half works much, much better than the first half.  I think it is because I buy the relationship between the two (especially the love that Pitt has for Cotillard) much, much better in the 2nd half of the film.  Pitt's Canadian spy is aloof, guarded and distant in the first half, good for a spy, bad for an actor trying to portray that he is falling in love.  Cotillard, in my opinion, is a much better actor than Pitt and was able to show all of these emotions at once, while Pitt was only able to show the void of emotion - the detachedness - during the first half of this film.In the 2nd half, Pitt's character is able to show his emotions - and his love - on his sleeve and he much better portrays the love he has for this woman - who may hold a secret.  Cotillard, as always, is magnificent in her role playing the many layers of this character simultaneously and you feel for her at the end.These two are aided by a strong group of supporting actors/actresses - Lizzy Caplan as Pitt's sister (another Candian spy), the always watchable Jared Harris (as Pitt's boss) and the best actor portraying a Nazi not named Christoph Walz - August Diehl - as a, what else, Nazi who gets in the way of our two heroes.Zemeckis' direction is professional and workmanlike and works in this film, never getting in the way of the story, but not benefiting it either.  He let's the story and the actors carry the film and that is where this film is going to be won (or lost).For me, it was 3/4 won.  Bring your hankies, you're gonna need them.7 (out of 10) stars and you can take that to the Bank (of Marquis)",Allied
78,dave-mcclain,"""Allied"" is one of the best spy movies in years!",9,1 December 2016,"Some actors seem to gravitate to stories and histories centered on World War II. Take Tom Hanks for example. Besides starring in ""Saving Private Ryan"", one of the best modern WWII movies around, he also teamed up with that film's director, Steven Spielberg, to help produce two television mini-series, ""Band of Brothers"" and ""The Pacific"". Brad Pitt's film career also continues returning to the most devastating war in history. The spy drama ""Allied"" (R, 2:04) is Pitt's fourth WWII film, after Quentin Terantino's ""Inglourious Basterds"" (2009), the short film ""Beyond All Boundaries"" (also 2009 – and narrated by Hanks) and ""Fury"" (2014). (Pitt has done his share of films taking place in other wars too – and spy movies, including 2005's ""Mr. & Mrs. Smith"" and 2001's ""Spy Game"".) So, does ""Allied"" live up to his previous forays into the European Theater in the 1940s? Nope. In my opinion, it surpasses them.Pitt plays Max Vatan, a Canadian officer who works for the British RAF as a spy and assassin. As the movie opens, it's 1942 and Max is parachuting into Morocco where his mission is to help assassinate the German ambassador in Casablanca. The person he's helping is French spy Marianne Beauséjour (Oscar winner Marion Cotillard), who is to pose as his wife. They live for a short time very carefully and very convincingly as husband and wife, laying the groundwork for the successful accomplishment of their risky mission. In spite of their best efforts, and knowing the dangers, Max and Marianne fall in love for real. After they leave Morocco, Marianne joins Max in London, where they marry and start a family.Max continues doing his part in the war effort (although the spy stuff appears not to be a major focus of his duties), as Marianne takes care of the home and their baby girl. They're living in a cottage outside of London and enjoying life (well, as much as you can, in the midst of frequent bombings by the German Luftwaffe), including entertaining friends and spending time with Max's sister (Lizzy Caplan), who is also living and working in the area. When Max is told to go see a certain high-level intelligence official (Simon McBurney) and Max's supervisor and friend, Frank Heslop (Jared Harris), is also in the room, Max thinks that he is about to be offered a promotion. Unfortunately, nothing could be further from the truth.British intelligence thinks that Max's wife is actually spying for Germany and they seem to have some pretty compelling evidence to back up their assertions. Max is displeased. At first, he refuses to cooperate in the investigation of Marianne, but he really has no choice but to accept his newest assignment. He has been told to leave a specific piece of (phony) intelligence where his wife can see it, in order to test whether she is the person in her neighborhood passing on classified information. Max does as instructed, but while everyone is waiting to see whether she takes the bait, Max disobeys direct orders to take no other actions in this case. He races against time trying to disprove the allegations against Marianne, putting his life and the lives of others at risk in the process. IS there a spy? If so, who is it? No spoilers here, but I will say that the situation presents some serious ethical dilemmas for all.""Allied"" is one of the best spy movies in recent memory. There's plenty of drama, intrigue, action and genuine emotion. It's also unpredictable. I went in thinking that I knew where the story was going to go, but I was wrong – and very happy to be. The story highlights the stress and danger of working in the clandestine services during wartime – and the struggle of everyone else just to make it through alive. Oscar-winning director Robert Zemeckis brings his considerable experience to bear on Steven Knight's taut script, while Pitt and Cotillard both do an excellent job of drawing us in and selling the story. The supporting players are also top-notch, and the hairstyling, costumes and production design give a very authentic feel to each and every scene. This is a well-balanced and very enjoyable film.

79,swilliky,A tension filled spy thriller,7,29 November 2016,"Brad Pitt and Marion Cotillard star in this World War II spy thriller directed by Robert Zemeckis. The film develops a lot of slow build tension that was highly entertaining to watch and made for a fun night at the movies. Brad Pitt is introduced as spy Max Vatan that is dropped in French Morocco with a mission to kill a German ambassador. He has slick clothes and operates smoothly as he rendezvous with another operative Marianne (Cotillard) who is undercover as his wife waiting for him.Their relationship grows with much of the plot dedicated to how they meet and become lovers. They procure tickets to a party where the ambassador is attending and have a short little action sequence. All of this is just a set up to get them back to London where they marry and have a child under the threat of German bombs.

You're drawn into the film and Cotillard and Pitt, like the cinematography, are just gorgeous. The film is entertaining, without question.That said, the film has a few too many period/cultural inaccuracies and also a rather sloppy last half-hour that brings it down a bit.I just cant destroy the film for what amounts to 3-4 oversights. While they are big problems in terms of 'how can you not get it right' , they are still outweighed by the films overall production values, performances, and well-paced storyline. Allied is a good movie for those who want entertainment and wont be too distracted by the historical mistakes. If these types of issues ruin a movie for you then don't watch it. For me this is a strong 6, and had immense potential to be so much more.

82,anselmdaniel,Intriguing but hollow,8,31 December 2018,"This review contains spoilers.Allied is a war movie that premiered in 2016. The movie directed by Robert Zemeckis and is written by Steven Knight. The movie stars Brad Pitt and Marion Cotillard. The movie is about a Canadian intelligence officer that falls in love with a French Resistance fighter. The movie follows the two main leads as they go through the Second World War.Allied is a beautiful movie. The entire movie is beautifully lit with gorgeous sets. Robert Zemeckis also directs this movie well. The scenes have a great flow and tone to them. In addition all of the effects in the movie are at a high class. One can easily like the movie on the visuals by itself.The acting and chemistry from the leads is natural. It feels organic to see the interaction between Pitt's character of Max Vatan and Marion Cotillard's character of Marianne Beausejour. I did like the growing romance between the two leads. Especially towards the end when Max Vatan had to question his loyalties. The movie does great whenever it presents these two on the screen.The movie does not tread new ground. Everything that this movie does feels familiar. This is either from the setting, genre, or story the movie possesses. The only vaguely original idea that the movie has is the one romance in its leads. This is not even an original idea as this is a concept that has been done before. The execution of these ideas is interesting.The writing is hit and miss. I felt that much of the movie was drawn out for too long. The main plot and source of thrill with finding out if Marianne Beausejour is a double agent or not does not kick in until about half way through the movie. The journey is still cool and fun to watch but the movie feels like two separate movies.The first half of the movie introduces the audience to the two leading characters. This introduction has many characters that never come back later. The introduction is slick and entertaining but it fails to have a larger impact other than the immediate romance.The movie is also predictable. I was hoping for a twist on some interesting way for Max, Vatan to find if his wife is a spy or not. This unfortunately never happened. Instead the movie had Max Vatan undertake extreme missions to find his out about his wife. This is incredibly ridiculous to watch as Max takes on squads of German soldiers. The movie should not be an action movie. It should focus on the characters which is where the directing and writing excels at.I would recommend Allied.Grade: B",Allied

86,CANpatbuck3664,Allied is Very Beautiful and Wholly Entertaining but a Little Too Ambitious,8,26 November 2016,"I was pretty excited for Allied even when the mixed reviews started coming out. The premise was entertaining (a World War 2 spy thriller dealing with a very intimate betrayal) and they got 2 of the biggest actors/actresses working right now in Brad Pitt and Marion Cotillard. Add in Robert Zemeckis (The Walk, Flight) behind the camera and that made for an interesting combination. Then you sprinkle in some big budget effects and I was sold completely. There haven't been many runaway Oscar contenders yet so I thought maybe this was being positioned for that kind of run. After seeing it, I don't think it's going to achieve those aspirations even though this movie is clearly swinging for the fences.*Minor Spoilers Ahead* Max Vatan (Brad Pitt) is a Canadian intelligence officer that parachutes into French Morocco during World War 2. His goal is to rendezvous with a local contact in the French Resistance and his mission is to assassinate the German Ambassador. After being picked up and driven to Casablanca, he meets up with her at a local nightclub. She's bubbly and affectionate as even though they have never met, they're supposed to be man and wife. After some quick introductions, they leave the club and actually introduce themselves to each other. They get along fine, Marianne Beauséjour (Marion Cotillard) is a perfectionist and has spent time working her way into being friends with the right people so they can get close to their target. Max has read up on Marianne but she's unwilling to answer any questions about her past. They start to feel each other out and by the end of the night they've become familiar enough to proceed with the plan for the attempted assassination in 10 days.The first thing that you notice in Allied is how the movie wants to transport you back into 1940s. It's easy to be impressed with how cool the movie looks, the wardrobe and the set design are beautiful. I really like watching period pieces for that sense of escape. The CGI in the movie looks good at points like the ground views on the aerial battles but sub par in others like at the beginning when Brad Pitt is parachuting in. Some people would be quick to criticize Allied for this but it is a gorgeous looking movie for the most part and you can climb into this time in history that much easier.Even though I enjoyed Allied for the most part, I do feel like that the advertising for it was misleading. This movie can be easily divided into 2 halves. The second half is the spy thriller that you see in the trailers, the first half is completely different though. It's more of a romantic drama. Both of these parts work but I found the spy thriller part to be far more interesting. The ingredients are there with 2 A-list actors, the setting is beautiful and the story is suitably epic. But I still had a hard time getting invested. I didn't think there was much chemistry between Marion and Brad and although I was always engaged in Allied, it wasn't the whole package it was trying to be.I was just pretty critical of the first part of Allied but I want to also get across when the angle of Marianne possibly being a Nazi spy gets introduced, the movie becomes super intense. You can feel the tension in every scene and the movie does a great job disguising whether Marianne is truly guilty. They feed you enough information that it could go either way. There's also some tight and brutal action sequences throughout the movie. It all builds to an ending that completely caught me off guard and I applaud it for that. This movie is old-fashioned in the way that it touches so many different genres at once and although I'm willing to say that while some were done better than others, when the movie works, it really works well.When I talk about the acting, it's kind of hard to explain how I thought things turned out. Brad Pitt and Marion Cotillard are both great actors and I think they do good work individually here but I still think they didn't sell the intimacy of their relationship. They're supposed to be willing to die for each other and I found the scenes where they were supposed to be falling in love to be stilted and a little robotic. I thought Jared Harris and Lizzy Caplan were good in their supporting roles but the movie is carried by Brad and Marion. They are solid but just not great together.You can feel the ambition behind this movie when you watch Allied. There seemed to be a concerted effort to capture the feel of older sweeping epics. I think that this contributed to the pacing problems in the movie and why there was such a drastic shift when Max and Marianne got back to England. It's a small complaint but I think this movie could have used a tighter edit. Conversely, that might have cost it some of the old school charm it was going for, so there would have been a trade-off. Anyway I'm closer to giving Allied a 7.5/10 but because I thought the second half was so strong, I'll round up and give it an 8/10.",Allied

I am not the only viewer to find the dilemma presented to Brad Pitt's Canadian spy hard to swallow, although it does give the movie some much- needed tension after the move from Morocco to London. The ending is poignant, but I didn't for one moment believe in it.The lack of credibility in the plot is not helped by the shallowness of the two lead performances. Pitt and Marion Cotillard appear to be reading their lines from an auto-cue and, despite some hot sex scenes which belong in a different movie, there is surprisingly little chemistry between them. Robert Zemeckis delivers the level of cinematography and lighting we expect from him, and the CGI in the Blitz scenes is outstanding, but the story is such a clunker. Pitt, once the most beautiful man in the industry, is still handsome in his fifties but he cannot rely on his looks alone to carry him over the hurdles provided by a movie as dated and derivative as this.",Allied

90,PyroSikTh,Has Homage to Classics Written all over it,6,30 November 2016,"Max is dropped in Morocco and meets a French resistance fighter, masquerading together as a married couple until their assassination attempt. Things heat up between the two and they end up becoming a real married couple and moving to London in the heat of WWII, but everything may not be as hunky-dory as it may seem.The story is quite interesting. It's split into two halves, with the first taking place in Casablanca, and the second on London, and each has their own mini three-act stories to tell. We meet Max and Marianne, they parade around the city together as she teaches him how to behave and they attempt to blend in and convince suspicious eyes that their relationship is real. It really is quite captivating espionage, feeling far more grounded and realistic than most spy movies prefer. It all climaxes at a party attended by a German officer, after which they are never seen again.The second half slows a bit and loses it's interesting espionage angle. We see the relationship between Max and Marianne, but we never particularly feel it. The façade of their marriage in the first half makes their genuine marriage feel unconvincing. Once Max is told that his wife might be a German spy, accompanied by some rather convincing evidence, he makes little effort to cover up his feelings and suspicions from her (or anyone else for that matter), betraying the impeccable visage of a spy we were lead to believe he was. If she really is a spy for the enemy, then it makes you wonder why alarm bells aren't ringing for her, especially considering how good she was portrayed early on. It seems a year in London has made them both really bad at their jobs.I haven't seen Casablanca (and if I'm honest, I have no intention of doing so), but even I could tell it was a massive influence on Allied, almost as if they wanted to remake the classic, but didn't have the gusto, so made their own story set in the same city and utilising the same style and visual classiness. Everything from the make-up to the costuming makes this movie feel like a classic piece of cinema, but in colour. It definitely gave it a certain visual identity in today's climate.Acting is altogether quite good, but never stands out as anything to shout about. Brad Pitt plays Max with a stoic reservedness befitting a spy, and yet quite innocent in the face of an unfamiliar country. His outbursts in London feel emotive, even if played for laughs and goes a long way to developing the real Max. Marion Cotillard plays Marianne with a clouded veneer that goes a long way to encapsulating her role as a spy, even when the action movies to London. It makes her a difficult character to root for as she comes across quite suspicious and like she's hiding something. Even when she claims she's being entirely real and genuine, it makes it hard to truly believe her. Jared Harris, Lizzy Caplan and a few other recognisable faces makes appearance and gobble up the scenery (even if Caplan's character, and her situation, are a little unbelievable for 1940s London).In all, there just isn't a lot to say about Allied, and that's probably my biggest criticism. I don't feel there was any real hook to get me to want to watch it a second time. It was all very well- made with some satisfactory performances. It had some very interesting, if fleeting moments, such as Marianne criticising Max's Parisian accent (which was amusing as Pitt was just using a standard American accent), and the plane shot down over their house was a truly terrifying moment, but in all it just sort of moulded into the background. A decent homage to classic cinema. I give it an above average, reasonably well-made 6/10.",Allied
91,CineMuseFilms,Action-packed espionage but with an ordinary script and unconvincing performances,6,20 December 2016,"The classic ruse in the espionage thriller genre is to keep us in the dark about who is the double- agent. The film Allied (2016) is based on the premise that the romantic heroine might be a spy for the other side and asks what happens if she is caught. Beautiful filming on nostalgic locations and top-tier talent raises expectations for this film but they are disappointingly let down by an ordinary script and unconvincing performances. In 1942, Canadian intelligence officer Max (Brad Pitt) is parachuted into Cassablanca to terminate a high-ranking Nazi. He poses as the husband of French Resistance fighter Marianne (Marion Cotillard) in order to infiltrate local German society until the mission is complete. They become romantically involved and after the mission escape to London where they really do marry. The couple are blissfully happy until Max is informed that his wife is suspected of being a double-agent. If proved, he must execute her or he will be hanged for high treason. Furthermore, until the investigation is complete he must continue as if nothing unusual was happening. Woven into this plot line are several action-filled twists to flesh out the narrative and to keep the audience guessing about Marianne. This film does not lack action but it does have a serious believability deficit. From the opening parachute descent, to the various set-piece shoot-outs until the final shot, there are just too many scenes that feel fake. For example, after carrying out the mission in full view of German soldiers they leave the building with as much panic as a couple rushing for a bus hoping nobody notices their machine guns are not baguettes. And after a German bomber is shot down outside their house they grab a picnic blanket and their baby to sit near the smoking aircraft as if lounging by a duck-filled pond. Regardless of how rugged or violent the scene, this espionage glamour-couple keep their makeup intact and fashionable clothes neatly pressed but are devoid of any chemistry or genuine emotion. What works for the debonair James Bond with his legendary aura of British reserve-under-fire simply does not work for Brad Pitt. Bond has gravitas and panache; in this role, Max only manages parody. Flat lines like ""I've looked into her soul"" epitomise the plasticity of script and delivery. Once credibility goes, a film rarely recovers. Like many scenes in this film, the climactic moments are shallow melodrama whereas they could have been a real gut-wrencher.

93,LloydBayer,"At its best, Allied is an effective spy thriller rather than the tearjerker it tries to.",7,26 November 2016,"At the start of the second act a character says ""Marriages made in the field never work"". It's a saying that pretty much sums up Allied, a war time espionage film built on the platform of a cloak and dagger romance. Set in the 1940s with an opening shot over the Moroccan desert, Allied works as a period piece with a nifty throwback to Casablanca. It's all there - Exotic locales, tailor made suits, rumbling jazz music, chrome trimmed automobiles and every other polished detail from a Humphrey Bogart classic. This is fair evidence that Veteran director Robert Zemeckis is still a stickler for gorgeous set pieces and it works in favour of screenwriter Steve Knight's story; for the most part.With Casablanca as the backdrop and WWII raging in the background, we meet Canadian intelligence officer and RAF pilot Max Vatan (Brad Pitt). His assignment from headquarters in London is to assassinate a high ranking German official. Gathering intel for the job and also helping him blend in with the crowd is French Resistance fighter Marianne Beausejour (Marion Cotillard) posing as his wife. Leading up to the assassination, this first act takes exactly 40 minutes but crucial to how the ending resonates with the viewer. We watch them prepare for the assassination, stage love scenes to avoid arousing suspicion and eventually pull off an improbable mission, before impulsively marrying and starting a new life in London. Up until this point the pacing is as restrained as dragging a thick slab of concreate over a thin layer of ice. Then kicks in a crescendo of suspense when Max is told that his wife is not who she appears to be. Worse, his new orders are to execute her or hang for high treason. For better or worse (pun unintended) Knight's screenplay goes from a slick spy thriller to sloppy love story by adding a trick question followed by a similar but trickier question – how well do you know your spouse? And, how well do you think you know your spouse? Those questions were aptly answered in 2014's Gone Girl, a much more twisted crime-thriller, but unresolved during the final big reveal in Allied. It's not the fault of the leads, both seasoned thespians in the prime of their careers. The problem lies in the limited time we are given to learn how Max and Marianne really feel for each other. That's primarily because their relationship maintains a single tone while faking it and even after they are blissfully married. What could have worked is allowing their intimacy to develop enough for us to care about them. Unfortunately, this barely happens, resulting in a rushed and anti-climactic ending despite Cotillard's captivating delivery.What does work is the outstanding production quality that hearkens back to the golden age of Hollywood. Weakness in the script aside, Allied is still a spectacle with equal doses of suspense, drama and action. His reputation for fantastic visual effects and fleshed out characters notwithstanding, Zemeckis can be credited with a near perfect war era film when viewed solely as an espionage thriller. Perhaps even a perfect one if the source material was a John le Carré novel. Even so, there is plenty to keep you on edge – even if that means watching a baby being born under the blitz.",Allied

95,rooee,An uneasy alliance of squandered talent,5,23 November 2016,"1942. Intelligence agent Max Vatan (Brad Pitt) parachutes into the Moroccan desert, where he's picked up by a wordless driver and taken to Casablanca. There he connects with Marianne Beausejour (Marion Cotillard), a French agent. Together they pose as a married couple – the precursor to a daring assassination attempt on a German ambassador.Max and Marianne fall for each other, of course, and after the job Max invites her to return with him to London as his wife. Following the Blitz-born birth of their child, the Vatans enjoy an apparently idyllic partnership. But then Vatan's superiors call him in. Questions are raised about Marianne. Is she who she says she is? Could it be that she's telling ""a lie""? (Ally, get it?)Allied isn't a particularly good film. Chief concern is that it is scuppered by a crushing lack of chemistry between its stars. (Goes to show, all the sordid celebrity speculation in the world can't make the magic happen on screen.) I've a feeling the blame rests on the shoulders of Pitt, whose performance here is unusually dull. A flirty Cotillard tries her best to raise him from the dead, to no avail.But also there is director Robert Zemeckis – such an inventive student of film – who appears to be honing a TV aesthetic here. It worked for Spielberg's Bridge of Spies because that was essentially a chamber piece. But Zemeckis is reaching for grandeur – a feat which should be possible with an $80m-plus budget – without succeeding. Allied has the same hyper-real sheen we saw in his last film, The Walk, whereby everything somehow looks CG even when it isn't.Structurally, the film has problems. The first half is an outright clunker, with any dramatic tension undermined by the inevitability – the yawning predictability – of the plot shift to come. It's only when the 'twist' (if we can call it that) is finally traversed that the film enters any kind of stride. Following the move to Blighty, things fare better. Zemeckis's depiction of period Britain has the generic Little England postcard quality that comes from the outsider's eye, and the co-stars can't quite de-glam sufficiently to make their marriage believable, but writer Steven Knight's plot beats keep the narrative chugging in a workmanlike way.In the last half hour, the film finally sputters into life like an old RAF propeller, but it's too little too late. The climactic scene – a brilliantly tense exercise in visual storytelling of which Hitchcock would be proud – almost feels like it's been cut in from a different movie.Handsome and competent and quite boring, Allied doesn't even have the good grace to be enjoyably bad. It wears its okayness with pride: big production values, big names, big talent – but little to remember of it a week after watching.",Allied
96,James_De_Bello,7.5/10,7,16 January 2017,"In 1942, a Canadian intelligence officer (Brad Pitt) in North Africa encounters a female French Resistance fighter (Marion Cotillard) on a deadly mission behind enemy lines, they join forces, disguised as husband and wife, but after spending precious time together, both realize that their fictitious roles might just be a truth for the both of them.When Robert Zemeckis makes a film I am sure to be there, he has graced the silver screen for four decades with quality pictures for worldwide audiences, always maintaining a romantic sensibility without ever loosing a masterful sense of filmmaking and storytelling. ""Allied"" is once again a solid, well told story that reaches for all audience out there.The film has a slightly sloppy introduction, it switches from solid moments that are building to something to poor character development with the two leads. Fortunately Cotillard and Pitt have enough chemistry and charm together that the audience just goes through the first act without really feeling the weight of the problems that fortunately eclipse with the main bulk of the film.As I said the two leads aren't well developed in the first half, whilst you get a very clear sense of who these two individuals are and what lengths they are willing to go for their cause, with some very surprising and raw scenes, you don't get a logical understanding of why they fall in love. Certainly you feel the connection, but the film never really shows you why the two start to appreciate each other, it doesn't build up their relationship rather than just introduce it.Still, when we get to the second act in London, much of this is erased thanks to some really good work by the actors and Zemeckis. They manage to, in a way, reintroduce us to the new lives of these people and we really buy them as a couple, Pitt and Cotillard go really far into their performances with one another and there is a sexual undercurrent to the whole film that whilst slightly sidelined does emphasize moments that make you understand this marriage deeply.So on a level of romanticism the film does trip in different moments with a slightly gratuitous build up of their relationship, but overall when you look at it moment by moment, there is no denying that it is, unsteadily, built up to actually some very intense emotional depth that is vital for the thriller aspect of the film to succeed.Which, transitively, it does and is probably the most fascinating aspect of the feature. The middle hour of the film is definitely its best moment and were it not for the lesser start and finish, it would have added up to a great film. The inciting incident comes far into the movie's length, but once it does it kicks off a relentless pace that keeps you on you toes, guessing for a very long time.Zemeckis manages to build tension upon tension in a master's way, the structure of the screenplay supports the veteran director into making a sequence of scenes that is a breathtaking, edge-of-your seat experience which mixes a very good emotionally deep component to the setting of World War II producing a miss-en-scene that captivates the viewer's attention. Every moment is built up with set-up, reminder and pay off and you are never lost in the mix, everything's always clear, the motivations are constantly solid and you route or the hero without reservations.Just as its partially uneven beginning, the finale of the film is a notch below its main focus. There are moments that hit home and Cotiallard gives her all in her last scenes, bringing some really intense performance work to the screen, but unfortunately the film just looses a little steam with a couple of coincidences and with an ending that doesn't really build onto a convincing climax, but rather to a more clichèd-romantic one.""Allied"" anyways remains an underrated romantic thriller with fantastic and lush settings that manage to bring to life a time and a place which support a story that has much flare to spare for any kind of audience.",Allied
97,kgprophet,Bland Pitt Dulls Perfunctory Filmmaking,5,9 December 2016,"Robert Zemekis is capable of big productions. Allied is a way too small of a film with such big names. Alas, this feels like an 'inbetween' production that was thrown together to fill a hole in the director's schedule. The first problem is that Pitt gets no introduction in the beginning, and honestly felt like ""Inglorious Basterds II"". There is a scene much later in the film where it shows Pitt as the commander of a group that is collaborating with the French Resistance. He has a nice scene with a young pilot that allows Pitt to show real leadership and experience. I wish the filmmakers found a way to put that scene in the beginning of the film. Pitt instead is very stiff in this film, looking uncomfortable like he is being forced to do this role instead of being invested in the character. Marion Cotillard plays a socialite that is the life of the party. As such she is allowed to fill the screen with her personality. Obviously this film is meant to be more of a romance film than a thriller, since moments of intrigue are few and far between. One can only barely note any Zemekis touches. They are basically the air battle scenes over London that have extra elements. We learn very little of what Brad Pitt does once the film moves from Casablanca to England. We know he works with the resistance and flies an airplane. If only there were a bit more depth to Pitt's activities. Instead more time is spent on Cotillard as she adapts to living in England. The big plot twist that is not a spoiler is that she is suspected of being a German spy. However there is no real increase in tension over that big attention-getter. The film does not change in tone or momentum for the most part. And the super big twist at the end is a big let down. Spoiler AheadThe let down is that there is no super big twist at the end. Cotillard is a spy but was coerced. We see some side characters that were part of the spy ring that aren't a big shock when revealed. The actions of Cotillard once she suspects getting caught are nothing extreme.Spoilers FinishedThings start to finally ratchet up in the third act. But there are many potential moments where more tension or even more mystery to Cotillard could have helped make this film a more sophisticated and suspenseful story. Most reviews seem to have a reaction of ""well it's not bad"". I went to see it on a weeknight when I had nothing better to do, not expecting to jump out of my seat with this kind of film. I just thought if this film was given to some younger ambitious filmmaker, there could be a lot more individuality in the production. Here, everything is pretty bland, mostly due to Brad Pitt never saying very much, and posing for beauty shots in every scene. For a romantic film, that's what is expected, I guess, but I think this film could have some depth as well. Ultimately I can't recommend this film because it fails to provide anything new or memorable to the genre.",Allied
98,Ramascreen,ALLIED will easily steal your heart away!,8,21 November 2016,"Brad Pitt and Marion Cotillard are not Humphrey Bogart and Ingrid Bergman, obviously, but in ALLIED they sure seem like they could be. This film is a love letter to the golden age of Hollywood, where even the stars remain glamorous in the middle of the war. Definitely a throwback to those classic films, it even features that famous Moroccan city of Casablanca. And the espionage tale of love and betrayal at the heart of it all is nothing short of suspenseful.Scripted by Steven Knight (""Eastern Promises"") and directed by Robert Zemeckis (""Forrest Gump"") every shot in ALLIED intends on seducing us, getting our guard down. Brad Pitt plays intelligence officer Max Vatan who in 1942 teams up with French resistance fighter Marianne Beausejour (Cotillard) on a deadly mission behind enemy lines. There they too fall in love and after accomplishing and surviving their mission, they reunite for marriage. Years go by, they build for themselves a happy little family, until one day Vatan's superior informs him that his wife, Marianne, may actually be a German spy.This isn't Mr & Mrs Smith Spy vs. Spy actioner, because throughout ALLIED, you're rooting for Pitt's character to prove his superior wrong every step of the way, you really want this couple to succeed. It's more of a love thriller if there is such a thing, as pressures keep building up, as time starts to run out. And when you have two of the most beautiful people on the planet, it's so easy to feel for them. Brad Pitt and Marion Cotillard are just so wonderful together, they may well be the last true movie stars as far as I'm concerned.

Years earlier he was sent into French Morocco to team up with another spy named Marianne Beausejour (Marion Cotillard). As teasers show, they take on a suicide mission, end up falling in love and having a life together. Back in England, Vatan is told that his wife is a German spy, which is when the mystery starts - is she or isn't she. Unfortunately, it's also when the plot falls flat.I can think of so many other creative ways that this could have played out, so that your choice would be more than a simple yes or no. Especially based on how they escaped from Morocco. But helas, the plot ends up being very simple with only minor small periods of tension.Brad Pitt was OK, but he always seemed to be portraying someone who was unfeeling to everything. Cotillard was terrific, but again, i think she could only do so much with such a simple plot.The best part of the film was the cinematography with some terrific scenes of what bombing attacks at night were like. Costume design was also outstanding because both Pitt and Cotillard were stunning when dressed to the nines to go out. It's too bad that some of that design flair could not have been spun into the plot to make IT more interesting.6/10 at best is my rating. Allied is not terrible, but it's nothing special either.

102,darkreignn,Why did the trailer have to give this much away?,7,12 December 2016,"I beg of you, if by some random chance you're reading this, and have no clue what this movie is about other than the fact that it stars Brad Pitt, Marion Cotillard, and that it takes place during World War 2, just stop reading and go see the film; it was made for people like you.For all others who have seen the trailer and then decided to see the movie, like me, let me first say that it disappoints me beyond belief that the trailer gave away the ""hook"" of the film, so to say. I mean I get it, they have to sell a product, and what better way to do that then by giving away the fact that Marion Cotillard may or may not be a German spy? Hell, it got me to buy a ticket. But when the first hour and fifteen minutes of your movie is a slow-burn romantic thriller that shows Brad and Marion slowly falling in love, getting married, and having a baby, maybe it'd be better not to reveal the first major twist in the trailer, no? See, up until the point where Brad Pitt gets called into a secret room and gets told that his wife may be a spy, the film feels like a classic wartime romance, but yet one that is building to something big, and if you've seen the preview, you know exactly what it's building to; but I can't help but feel like that moment was never meant to be spoiled in the marketing, because if it were, why would the bulk of the movie be dedicated to the budding and blooming romantic relationship of Brad and Marion, when the twist comes completely out of left field in the second? It is painfully obvious that the moment where Mr. Pitt, playing Max Vatan, gets told that his wife may or may not be a German spy was never meant to be spoiled in the marketing, and it angers me to no end that it was.But, putting aside the fact that the trailer gives away the films most intense moment, how is the movie as a whole? Remarkable. As I said before, it really does feel like a classic wartime romance movie. From the acting, to the action scenes, to the romance, to the sets and the costumes and even the music, the movie just feels like it was originally released in the 40s but somehow got a super high-definition upgrade and was re-released to theaters in 2016. Slow, deliberate, and meaningful are words that I would use to describe the pacing, as everything being shown feels like it matters. Every shot and frame feels perfect, and even when nothing seems to be happening, you can't help but keep staring at the screen. And this, coupled with the sheer beauty and spectacle of the movies visual style, really make ""Allied"" one of the best looking films of the year; I would rank it right up there with ""The Neon Demon"" in terms of sheer eye candy.Brad Pitt and Marion Cotillard have fantastic chemistry, and really do feel like they're in love. However, because of the purposeful imitation of old movies, their relationship as a whole feels somewhat restrained and artificial at the same time. It's a strange blend, but it works, and if you see ""Allied"" then you'll know what I'm talking about. Regardless, their emotions feel real, and you better believe that when the most emotional moments come up to the surface you'll be feeling them too.And yes, there's some action. Notice, I said ""some."" There isn't much, but when there is, it's filmed beautifully. Slick and clean, the action is devoid of any shaky-cam whatsoever, and really lets you soak in what's happening on the screen. Its mildly bloody and brutal without lingering on the violence, and it never feels gratuitous or violent for the sake of being violent. Its stylish and graceful, brutal and beautiful, and even the most squeamish of people won't want to look away because of how pretty everything looks, even the violence.Overall, ""Allied"" is intense, well-acted, well-made, emotional, and romantic, and even though it isn't the best film of the year, it's one of them.",Allied

104,ferdinand1932,What would Bogart have done?,2,29 January 2017,"This story and its big drama is the kind of thing Humphrey Bogart did often after he had success with ""Casablanca"". That is not the only thing that connects this movie with Bogart; it is a very traditional, even well-worn, type of Hollywood movie. The Bogart fare was melodramatic and plotted very carefully and in those elements this film fails considerably.The story is small but as it goes it is rather dull, no other word for it, it is dull. It lacks drive and purpose and some unifying idea for the audience to connect with after the grace period, say 20 minutes, when we still don't know how it will develop.The writing is truly lamentable; if this is what it takes to get a movie deal now the product is bound to be awful The pitch meeting on the project would have been the most exciting thing because the execution, in the script and on screen is lifeless, aimless and lacking in drama.Then there are the anachronisms, the language Pitt uses to superiors, the way people greet each other, the sense that non one had the faintest idea of what the 1940s was like. The birth sequence deserves special citation: risible doesn't do it justice, it must be in the top 3 worst and ludicrous scenes ever shot in the last 40 years.As history is not what this film was really about when Pitt seeks to prove, or otherwise, his wife's veracity, and she has to pay a well-known national anthem, it seemed perfectly fine if she offered up some other tunes, for instance: ""Die Fahne-hoch"", ""Die Wacht am Rhein"", neither Pitt, nor the director, nor writer would have known the difference.And in the end it reaches it's terrible conclusion and delivers an unwanted epilogue which adds a mawkishness to the whole experience. It also signifies how bad the script was that it had to append such a long-winded and pointless conclusion to the work.It's lucky for Bogie that he never saw this, and its for sure that he would have passed on it, because he was a real professional who knew a dud if he'd been offered it.",Allied

No decent Espionage outfit would commit an oversight like that. The Gestapo would have gotten her lessons up front, or, maybe on the sly in U.K. once she settled there, in case the subject ever came up. With 3 weeks practice, I could play La Marseillaise convincingly. It ain't a recital at Albert Hall.Apart from that, I am impressed that the production team didn't script a typical clichéd happy ending. Even if she goes for option 1 above, you could still deliver a tragic conclusion by having a German agent finally 'get to her' (lethally). It's just that her character didn't strike me as a German patriot - hence, I can't buy that she would jeopardize her new life, just to pass low grade info to the Axis side, which, by 1944, was obviously going to lose anyway.",Allied

Undercover marriage soon becomes real husband and wife, or does it? Now parents and living in bombarded London, the British Intelligence suspect a leak among them and accuse Vatan's wife of being a double agent. Interestingly, it's more than just an ""is she or isn't she?"" dilemma, questioning Love itself, ""what if she is, what do I do?"" As Vatan is torn between suspicion and love with his loyalty hanging in the balance. Beauséjour isn't stupid either, far from it, noticing a change in her beloved husband. It's not the first time Pitt has fallen in love with an agent, first one being a favourite of mine, Spy Game, which I strongly recommend for fans of the cunning, twisted stories. Marion Cotillard always plays those unlikable, yet beautiful characters that has something bubbling underneath, but this is different and it's the first role I actually like her in. There's a good supporting cast with Jared Harris, Simon McBurney and an unrecognisable Lizzy Caplan. A good score from Zemeckis regular composer, Alan Silversti and some decent action sequences that serves as good fillers for the long-winded, unfolding mystery. But it's not entirely a mystery, though it plays out really well. Superbly edited but it's flawed with major plot holes which gladly might get overlooked. But it's an elaborate scheme of a story with plenty of space for questions as to why rushing to the end so to smooth over the holes. I think Knight missed a trick and could have used this as an opportunity to add more twists. Another issue with the film was Brad Pitt's acting, which I didn't find isn't believable. I actually think this is Pitt's worse performance when I compare it to his intense past acting in Spy Game and Legends of the Fall. Even with the strong chemistry between Cotillard and Pitt, it's Cotillard who saves the film, It's a good story, even if quite awry, entertaining and well shot but it's far from being Zemeckis' and Pitt's best work.

They work well together (Ala Mr and Mrs Smith) and Max asks Marianne to join him in England as his wife. She agrees and they marry and they have a baby, Anna. Later Max is told that Marianne may be a German spy. Max is very upset hearing this news and he has to prove this is not the case. There is a plan by the Royal Air Force to determine if Marianne is indeed a German spy. Max is ordered to comply with this plan and to stand down otherwise. Of course, he doesn't and goes about trying to prove Marianne is not a German spy. We in the audience have no way of knowing if Marianne is a German spy and we hope Max can prove she is not. The love between Max and Marianne is very good, and the chemistry is spot on, that is, until Max is told Marianne may be a German spy. He cannot help it but does look at Marianne somewhat differently and she does notice that something isn't right. The acting is good all around and we listen and look for subtle clues and we come up empty. The movie is somewhat slow going, but we are trying to help Max and we trudge along with him. Slowness isn't a concern of ours. They had some special effects that had me diving under the couch. A German plane being shot down looked like it would end up in Max's house, but didn't. Very Scary. Just prior to that the British shooting down German planes showed a sky being all shot up everywhere. Good effects.Okay, you will not like the ending as I didn't either. In a word it is ""shocking.""

113,vasco_cid,A classic example of the wayward opportunity,6,7 March 2017,"As Brad Pitt's character parachutes down towards the Moroccan sand dunes in a sweepingly beautiful track shot as the movie opens, Zemeckis teases you yet again. He gives you a promisingly beautiful, cinematic and engaging setup that he never carries through. It is a shame. That opening promised a great film considering the talent involved. The inspiration and the homages the film intends to pay are justified and handled with care and taste, yet the story itself doesn't seem to take a clear stand on whether this is a romantic drama set in the backdrop of WW2 or a gripping WW2 drama with a romantic story at its centre. This might seem like a play on words, but its rather not; whatever the approach Knight and Zemeckis should have spent more time delving into the plot, giving each character more room to grow and the audience more time or better setup to care for them. Pitt and Cotillard don't seem to know which part to play either, as their delivery never really gives us any empathy for the characters to make the finale poignant.Allied is sadly just that, an amalgam of great condiments that somehow don't go together leading to a bittersweet final product that leaves you scratching your head wondering what could have been.",Allied
114,jakob13,A Hollywood fable,1,26 November 2016,"""Allied' is the anti 'Casablanca'. Robert Zemekis is no Michael Curtiz. ""Allied' begins in Casablanca in 1942. It is a Casablanca made out of full cloth. In 1942, Casablanca was a thriving port city, yet we see camels and nomads dressed as though they're in a Christmas pantomime. We are told after a man, a European man makes love to his wife, he repairs to the roof to cool his libido. Utter rot. This is a Casablanca of a fertile but poetic bent, but hardly factual. Didn't anyone bother to note that the US liberated French Morocco in 1942? Did anyone bother to not put Casablanca close to the Sahara desert? Camels, exotic costume had a more appropriate place in Goulimine,once the prosperous camel market of Morocco. And the tale goes from fancy to silliness as it is obvious from the opening scenes that Cotillard is a German agent.",Allied
115,Rawal_Afzal,"Don't go by the reviews, go for the film!!!",10,11 March 2017,"Before I proceed to writing anything about the film, I must here commend an absolutely brilliant performance by Brad Pitt. What an excellent actor and what a solid performance he's put in here! He so well depicted the inner suffering that he went through after being made to suspect the wife he loved so much, and the doubts that went through his mind at the party and in general. The performance by the other protagonist and everyone else is pretty good, too.This film's getting a very raw deal I'm afraid. Given the uniqueness of the theme of the film, I was pretty sure to watch this at the cinema but negative reviews held me back. I thought, again, the whole concept was very unique and it must've required very sharp application, which the film-makers did very well. The suspense and the thrills that it creates with the twists and turns the film takes - like the possibility of this whole thing being a test for Max before he's given the promotion - and the connection that it puts between one event to another is all a work of some very intelligent people behind the camera.Such films could easily turn boring half way through, but for the qualities mentioned above and the World War Two as background meant that it always keeps you on your toes. I particular loved the scene where at the party they show the visuals from the ground as to how it feels when you witness jets fighting out things over your head, and then boom, the shot plane is heading towards your residence! Another thrilling scene was, when he followers the jeweler and tries to catch him off-guard by referring to the earrings, but he responds by giving the same answer as Max's wife.A couple flaws that I noticed: 1. the whole scene created and him in the first place flying to France to meet Delamare looked a bit odd. 2. Understand that the German Ambassador might've been a dissident that Hitler would've happily got killed in the process, but why would he sacrifice so many other officers just to be able to plant a spy? If my memory serves my well, Max and Marianne killed a lot of German personnel that day.It must be having other flaws too, but it didn't matter to me yesterday; or you could say the brilliant performances made me overlook all those things, and the twists themselves take your mind off anything else. So I'll take all that any day as a part of the package. So forget the nit-picking, the film is brilliant!I must add here that this film is a thousand times more exciting than any of the espionage films that I've watched so far from the James Bond, 'Mission Impossible' or Jason Bourne series. A lot of them have been a yawn-fest for me.",Allied
116,annuskavdpol,This is a Mr. and Mrs. Smith kind of story,5,1 December 2016,"This movie trailer shows the best parts of the movie, but in general the trailer seems to make Allied out to be a movie that seems to be a psychological thriller but the movie is not. In fact the movie is a romance about two people who appeared to be on the same side but as the movie progresses it is clear that one is a double agent. This is a love story where the double agent and the regular spy still love each other, or so it seems, but how can love double cross enemy lines and then expect to be allowed back into the neutral safety zone? Brad Pitt used to be a good actor, but his acting skills have decreased over the years. He presence in the movie was too strong and I felt I was watching a National Enquirer Magazine tabloid with Brad Pitt in it. The movie would have increased in quality and story-line without Brad Pitt in it.",Allied
117,punisherversion1,A major disappointment from a great director,4,21 November 2017,"240: Allied. This comes from the great Robert Zemeckis who made Back to the Future and Who Framed Roger Rabbit, two of my favorite movies of all time. He recently came back to live action filmmaking after his stint in motion capture. He made Flight and The Walk and now we come to Allied. Allied is about two people who meet in Morocco on a secret mission, they fall in love and get married. He later learns that she might be a spy for the German army. It has a very Hitchcock vibe to it. Or at least it tries to. It is an old fashioned kind of movie where it focuses more on the dynamics between their relationship. Even though it seems to be fairly thorough, it lacks something making the audience believe in their feelings for one another. It is an extreme slow burn of a movie and each character is hiding something so it seems like they're closed off from the rest of the world or nothing is real from them. Sadly I have to report that this was a slog to sit through. It moves really like sap pouring out of a tree. Brad Pitt for most of the time is a non entity. He seems to be entirely too stoic until the very end when we finally see some passion ignite in him that might have been helpful all along. It's just too slow. Most people will easily lose interest in this and I can't say that I blame them. I give this movie a D.",Allied
118,newjersian,Inconseavable fable,4,20 February 2017,"The movie is very well filmed. Brad Pitt and Marion Cotillard do their job. The costumes and the war environment in the move are authentic. So there is just one small ""but"": the major premise of this movie is false, and that kills the entire feature. Nobody executes the caught spies out of court, and even before getting all the information from the spy. And absolutely nobody requests from a family member to kill his spying relative. In addition, Max Vatan committed serious crime by himself, killing in England (!!!) two people because he supposed that they were spies. He also committed an act of treason by trying to run away with his spying wife. So the final scene is also false because Max Vatan would probably serve a life sentence. This all sums up to an inevitable conclusion: the movie is a flop, and a childish exploit of a war theme. Has Hollywood spent all its talents?",Allied

The poster is amazing, that undoubtedly makes me want to choose this movie to be watched than any other movies nowadays. So, I watched Allied and I can give some reviews of it. From the title ""Allied"" I can imagine there is something interesting about Intelligence story behind it. The tuxedo and long-black hat of Brad Pitt support my assumption. On the first scene, your wish was fulfilled because the plot was unpredictable, the setting is Morocco, and Brad Pitt speaks French. But after the next 30 minutes, the plot you can see is too easy and too perfect. This is really Hollywood romantic and dramatic style. We can not see the history of war meaning inside the movie, nor the title meaning of ""Allied"". Besides of that, the characters of Marillon Cottilard is too soft and changing too much. In brief, for me, this movie can not be listed on historical movie like Saving Private Ryan, but only dramatic film. Thank you.",Allied

Their mission brings them closer, ultimately causing them to fall in love, but their relationship is threatened by the extreme pressures of the war.On paper, this movie should be Oscar bait, but it falls short due to it's problematic pacing and some dry performances. It sounds like overkill at this point, but chemistry is very important in any romance film. I always find comedies the hardest films to make, but I feel as though romance is always hard to evoke in any movie. I appreciated what Pitt and Cotillard tried to bring to the table, but it came off as dry, and the poor, and somewhat boring pacing doesn't help either. When conflict arises and things get going, they provide some entertainment with some tension building moments. Pitt's character Max goes through the extreme to prove that his wife Marianne isn't a spy or the Germans. So to that degree, at least the characters were somewhat engaging. Some characters in the film are also distractingly unnecessary like Lizzy Chaplan as Pitt's sister in the film Bridget Vatan. She didn't really serve anything to the plot at all. Robert Zemeckis has his hits and misses and does a competent job for the most part. But his best work is still Back to the Future. I just had to point that out. Technically the film is well made. It's lit fabulously, and the film itself is a huge throwback to 40's cinema. The set design is immersive and it showcases some delicate costumes for both leads. The film is overall visually rich and very pleasant to look at. Allied is at it's most compelling when it's a spy thriller, not when it's a sweeping romance with a WWII backdrop. At least the romance aspect is the one thing that most WWII films don't really bring to the table, as it is very uncommon. 6/10",Allied
123,jb07-660-944395,A Shallow Pitt,3,10 January 2017,"Just like Fury, Allied is another Pitt Special - a war comic that wants to be taken seriously.Apart from the wooden acting and the extremely long scenes of just talking, this slow moving script that was probably written by a ten year old is just so unbelievable.Please note that lots of spoilers follow.Why did Mr Pitt have to parachute into Casablanca? As a spy, he could have been much less conspicuous and caught the train.If his wife to be is such a careful and clever spy - as we are led to believe, why did she put Pitt's character on the spot by saying he was a poker specialist?We then have the spectacle of Pitt's character cutting the cards like a professional magician (yawn), and off course being able to write down complex chemical compounds - in line with his cover. It appears that for a one minute assassination job, he has had around five years training. Is there anything he can't do?If the British secret service think his wife is a spy, why tell him? Why not just bait the trap anyway!.The German soldiers are all presented as being zombie like gun fodder, when they actually were one of the most disciplined and efficient armies. In real life, Mr Pitt's character wouldn't have got very far after attacking the Germans in the town. Reinforcements would have flooded the area.The anti aircraft fire over London was obviously taken from the bombing of Bagdahd in the 21st century. If you watch YouTube clips of WW2 London AA fire it looked nothing like that.Why would you have a picnic next to a plane crash? Apart from the smell of aviation fuel, there would have been dead bodies in the wreckage.There are so many more stupid things in this movie, but I will just present my favourite for last.Mr Pitt turns into a Jedi near the end when entering the airfield with his wife and child. The guard commander comes to the car window, I can imagine Brad waving his hand, and the Commander then says words to the effect ""They can pass.""If you are thinking of paying to watch this movie, I would pass too.",Allied

It had been a while since we had seen Brad Pitt in a movie and he is an accomplished actor. His costar was beautiful and talented. They made for good eye candy as a couple. There was plenty of action across two different settings and times. It was not predictable or spelt out for you which is often the case with American movies, The English seem to do a better job of allowing the audience to fill in some gaps and silences. It kept us interested and entertained throughout. Cinemaphotography was good with colours and weather helping with the mood and atmosphere.

Historical dramas are among my top choices and it was fantastic watching two of my all-time favorite stars trying to play multi-layered characters and doing pretty good. Then Zemeckis decided to add coke heads and other modern Hollywood projections in scenes of WW2 Britain. Not only was the language, behavior and attitude not historically accurate, it was so distracting and unnecessary in a period piece. Beautiful cinematography and set pieces and a good story all ruined by a need to desecrate old, traditional behavior and values.

It did not quite add-up. The problems begin when the British discover that there is a spy in their midst. The spy is female and married to Brad Pitt's character who is a patriotic, Canadian underground agent. When the spy is discovered, Pitt is directed to kill his wife or it will be assumed that Pitt himself must be a spy.This puts the characters in an interesting no-good-way-out dilemma, but alas, it is a scenario that doesn't make a lot of sense. Does the act of Pitt's character killing his wife really prove that he too isn't a spy? But the thing I wondered about was: why shouldn't the British use the Nazi spy to their own advantage by peddling false information to the Nazis? Maybe that will be in a sequel. Sure, that's it.",Allied

128,culmo80,Disappointed,5,28 March 2017,"I was curious as to how this movie would play out. I enjoyed the film, but I was disappointed with the ending. With a different ending, I could have overlooked a lot of the other flaws. (Obviously this will include spoilers).The story is somewhat basic--two operatives on a mission fall in love and get married. Then, one of them is revealed to be a spy for the Germans, though a reluctant one at that. Half of the film is devoted to developing Pitt and Cotillard's relationship. It starts with a thrilling mission in Casablanca and ends with their eventual marriage, birth of their daughter, and Pitt's humdrum life as a desk officer in British intelligence. The second half of the movie revolves around Pitt being briefed that his wife is a German spy and that he must cooperate in a ""blue dye"" operation to know for sure. Over the course of three days, he must act normal and go along with the operation. Pitt is told that if she is found to be a spy, he must execute her immediately, or they will both be executed. But he loves his wife and he wants to prove her innocent, so he goes to great lengths to get information ... only to find out that she is indeed not the person she claimed she was. But she loves him and she was only cooperating with the Germans out of coercion. Pitt decides to spirit his family out of the country (in a single engine plane that couldn't have taken them anywhere useful, except maybe Ireland) but they are stopped and Cotillard, knowing her husband won't pull the trigger, shoots herself after confessing her love and telling Pitt that he must take care of their daughter. The end of the film is the verbal reading of a letter Cotillard wrote on her last day with her family (she knew she'd be caught). This ending really left a hollow feeling in me. It would have been better if Cotillard had somehow been saved. Indeed, there is historical precedent that the movie ignored.The whole ""you must execute her on the spot!"" thing was contrived. The British routinely turned German agents into double agents. Only the most hardened of spies who refused to turn would have been executed, and even then, most were imprisoned. Cotillard would have eagerly agreed to work as a double. It would have been a nice ending if she passed fraudulent reports to the Germans in the lead-up to D- Day, thus ""saving the day.""In reality, by the time D-Day kicked off, all of Germany's spies in the UK had been rolled up (either executed, imprisoned, or turned), so the whole notion that Cotillard's character would have been working for a German network is pure fiction.It's also fiction that Pitt (who is in his 50s) would be a ""field man."" At his age and with his rank, he would have been a senior officer working out of England, not parachuting into Morocco. And if Cotillard was suspected as a spy, Pitt would have also been investigated. He would not have been told to go along with this scheme. Why? Because of what we saw in the film. He would have been emotionally compromised. Therefore, the first Pitt would have heard of this would have been when she was arrested and he along with her. They would have interrogated him and ensured that he wasn't a witting accomplice.It was later stated in the film that the ambassador they assassinated in the beginning of a film was actually a dissident whom Hitler wanted killed. If so, Hitler would have just recalled the man and executed him in Berlin. He would not have allowed some long-odds intelligence operation to go forth in which he'd lose a number of SS and Abwehr officers. In short, there would be easier ways to get an agent into the British network.Anyway, I wanted to like this film better. If they had given it a happier ending, I would have. I thought the whole ""Allied"" title might be a nod towards how a husband and wife are allied together.",Allied

""Britain's Wonderful Fighting Forces"", Odhams Press, London W.C.2, Chapter IV, Army Co-Operation has a whole section on the Westland Lysander. This was the aircraft the SOE used to supply resistance fighters in France. It was fascinating seeing this aircraft up close. The movie starts off slowly with a rather strained relationship between Max & Marianne. It slowly builds, but you are not really aware of it. Eyes never lie and in time you can see in the way they look at each other that something powerful is at work. Fast forward to the UK and the story rapidly unfolds. The underground bunker scene is particularly disturbing, the unspoken horror of it all. I would have liked Max to utter a few choice Québecois words at the V Branch Rupert.

Even if it have, I doubt there would have been a successful film about it. It must be a great pleasure for a screenwriter to get a rare story like this. And this is a very good original script. I think the reason for the success of the film is the split storyline in the first and second sections. Overall, the romance and the suspense of war espionage are well interwoven and the flow and balance of the story is very good. It's even a bit unfair that no one can say anything about the writer who wrote such a great script, but only about the director. The screenwriter is Steven Knight. He has written some good films. I highly recommend you check it out.The director, Robert Zemeckis, only impressed me with Back to the Future and Real Steel. I looked into his works and found a lot of excellent works here as well. I'm looking forward to checking them out in the future.",Allied
131,RLTerry1,Duplicitous and Suspenseful!,7,21 November 2016,"Quite the duplicitous plot! Robert Zemeckis' Allied released by Paramount Pictures is a thrilling tale of espionage and love. We have certainly seen a few different ""spy"" movies over the last couple of years; some more about espionage and others more about the drama that ensues afterwards. Fortunately, Allied feels like a genuine spy movie that actually contains espionage. The production design and costumes are a beautiful throwback to the fabulous 40s. You'll find yourself reaching for a glass of champagne and swing dancing to Benny Goodman's timeless big band jazz hit Sing, Sing, Sing. There is one city synonymous with WWII, espionage, and romance and you will appropriately return to that iconic city of Casablanca in Allied. This is definitely not a reimagined Casablanca but there are indirect references to that movie sprinkled throughout this new story. Films like this one require top notch talent, and both Brad Pitt and Marion Cotillard deliver outstanding performances to accompany this staple in film genres. Not limited to the love story between Pitt's and Cotillard's respective characters, the movie also includes some deadly shootout scenes and dangerously close encounters with the Nazis behind enemy lines.Commander and intelligence officer Max Vatan (Pitt) is stationed in the famous city of Casablanca in French Morocco where he teams up with French resistance movement leader Marianne Beausejour (Cotillard). Impressed by her ability to so effectively blend in and create her authentic cover, Vatan soon finds himself falling in love with his partner. Following the assassination of a Nazi ambassador, Beausejour and Vatan flee to London to start their life together. Everything is going beautifully for the happy couple in their second year of marriage with a child when Vatan's superiors confront him with the suspicion that Marianne is in fact a Nazi spy. Refusing to believe it to be true, Max must now conduct his own investigation into his wife's history to protect the ones he loves so dearly.I absolutely adored the look and feel of the film as it echoes the era of the Golden Age of Hollywood. Although this movie plays off a tad listless as a result of failing to elicit a strong emotional response from the audience, it is not without it outstanding elements. It benefits from solid acting and beautiful cinematography as well as some fantastic symbolism. Robert Zemeckis' talent for visual storytelling is clearly visible in this period film. The weakness in the ability to successfully leave a lasting emotional impact on the audience is in the writing and executive producership of Steven Knight (Eastern Promises). For films that are not as much about the spectacle as they are the drama between characters and the challenge faced therein, it is vitally important that the personal/interpersonal relationships transcend the screen and directly impact the audience. All the makings were there for a deeply moving cinematic story, but it just doesn't quite make that transition from the mostly superficial and distant.Mirror, mirror, on the wall...(interesting fun fact: this misquoted line from Snow White is actually ""magic mirror on the wall""). But, I digress. The strategic use of mirrors is an incredible use of visual storytelling and symbolism. For those who have studied film or literary rhetoric, the mirror is a classic means of conveying duplicity (two sides, faces, etc of a character). Even without knowing that this was a spy movie, I would have been able to infer that from how the mirrors are shot and placed within the composition of the 24 frames a second. When using powerful symbolism as part of the visual story, it conveys so much more meaning in a scene than words could actually describe. Mirrors have long sense been a powerful metaphor even before moving pictures. But motion pictures allow for a greater use of the importance it plays in a cinematic story. Not limited to duplicity, mirrors can also be used as a metaphor for self-reflection. Whether talking duplicity or reflection, the mirror aids in conveying so much to the audience in this movie.Ordinarily, I am not a fan of classic films getting remakes; however, there are always exceptions when the core or essence of the film is held in tact but the production design, direction, and cinematography are brought up to speed with contemporary cinema. If you're a fan of WWII era films or the timeless spy movie, then you will definitely enjoy Allied. After witnessing the significance of Casablanca in this movie, I am actually looking forward to a remake if there ever is one. Provided. That the overall look and feel of the movie is in line with classical motion picture storytelling. I could definitely see Robert Zemeckis directing a remake of Casablanca. Occasionally there are directors who can strike the balance between classical cinematic storytelling told through contemporary technology, and Zemeckis definitely struck that balance in Allied.Don't allow the weak writing to dissuade you from watching it; there is actually a lot to enjoy in this film. After the slow burn during the first act, acts II and III are full of intrigue and suspense.",Allied

The acting is excellent, and though the climax at the end is somewhat unrealistic, it is necessary for suspense purposes. I am worried that the somewhat unrealistic expectations of this film, will put off other talented directors, such as Robert Zemeckis, from making good interpersonal relationship World War 2 films. Some films such as Pearl Harbor, and Little Boy, failed in being realistic as far as script and the human element is concerned. This, and the movie Ithaca, succeeded.Where War is the backdrop that effects the he characters. Rather than being about the war itself.As World War 2 enters the final twilight of living memory, we are losing more and more of these people and their times. We who are left behind, struggle to understand them. In my case, and is widely known in most cases, these people are very closed mouthed about these times. For those like myself, well done World War Two relationship movies help us to maybe understand them a little better. Especially if they are now gone. This film succeeds admirably in that. Understanding these people when we were young, wasn't so important as it is now. As we ourselves age, and are further and further removed from those times, it takes on greater importance.

134,Molongirl,Doesn't ring true,5,7 September 2017,"Its hard to pinpoint what was out of kilter with Allied as the basic story had potential. Perhaps it was the over glamorous look, a prettied up version of the time period and location. Plus the 2 main characters were just so unbelievable as spies. The clothing, the silly card shuffle scene,the quick flight to and from France, the way they too easily manage to shoot all the Germans chasing them. A Boys Own view of a hero spy? As for the swearing and lesbian characters, so historically out of place and very clunky as a result. Directors may get a kick out of filming a lesbian kiss but it wouldn't have taken place so publicly in that time period and strange but true not everyone ran around saying the ""f"" word then. I do like love stories but this never felt true, it was all too cardboard cut-out and contrived. My favourite actor was the baby, just beautiful! Sorry but I was looking forward to a good story and was very disappointed. It came across as an American version of what they thought second world war spies should have been like rather than any attempt at accuracy, so had an almost ""spoof"" feel to it.",Allied
135,Amadio,A flawed gem of period drama,7,3 December 2016,"Allied is a good film that is marred by serious failings.1 Brad the Pits. Seriously, this guy cannot act. He has three stock expressions; grinning like an imbecile in a self-conscious ""I'm a Hollywood star"" way, the bafflement of a man who can't find his underpants, and the confusion of a twit who cannot tie his shoelaces. Any scenes that call for anger, fear, sorrow etc are filled in with one of the above three. For a romantic period drama he is painfully out of his depth. He is 'boy-man' not 'man-man' and any rumours of a romance between him and his co-star during the making of the film can be seen to be ridiculous.2 The pacing of the film is strange. LONG periods that are slow and moody (tedious for some in the theatre!), interspersed with intense moments that were well telegraphed. In this respect it was like a horror film. I found myself fidgeting, then sudden moments of adrenaline. This pacing gets better in the last half hour, and it reads much better.3 I posit that, famous though he is, Zemeckis hasn't made a decent film since Castaway (Polar Express not withstanding ;) ). Here, in Allied, he is seen to be trying to make a Hollywood romance, he is trying to ignite that indefinable spark between the stars, he is trying to build the tension. None of it seems to flow naturally. As mentioned in other reviews, naturally one turns to The English Patient and Casablanca to find parallels, but Zemeckis has missed the beauty and romance of both, respectively.4 The score. Very weak, especially in the romantic scenes, more like Disney than serious drama.Now for the good.1 Marion Cotillard. Her performance here alone is worth the price of a cinema ticket. Every mood, nuance, expression, glance, conveys volumes. Absolutely stunning. By Hollywood standards she is not particularly attractive, too slim and coquettish, yet in Allied she is sexy, beautiful, pretty, vain and desirable. A lingering shot of her thinking says lines of dialogue. I cannot believe Zemeckis directed this to happen, she just took the role and flew with it (in the process making Pitt appear even more out of his depth). She carries the film and makes it interesting. Tour de force. An Oscar is not good enough for this performance. 2 The cinematography. Really well filmed. Many interesting shots, great editing. A scene in a car in a desert is excellent, conveying the feelings, the passions, the fears far better than any acting could. But again, Cotillard is superb here. The camera catches her well, she appears very natural on screen - and hence believable.3 It's a good story, and I wasn't sure what was going to happen. I liked the tension, the denouement in the last half hour, the ending (apart from Pits lamentable acting). I came out of the cinema thinking what I would have done in those circumstances, how would I have felt. It stayed with me for several days.4 The attention to detail of recreating the 40's is good, only one anachronism I could spot. Some of the sets really look like sets, which spoils the effect, but mostly I found it a well-constructed period drama with little quirks that made you wonder ""Was it really like that?!""All in all, Allied is worth watching for Marion Cotillard, if nothing else. It's a good story, reasonably delivered, and I left with that warm feeling of satisfaction of having seen something I enjoyed.",Allied

Or face mega consequences. No arrest as a Nazi plant and perhaps getting valuable info from her, but it was Brad's task to kill the woman he loved and leave his child motherless.Huh?

138,cschultz-2,Casablanca It Ain't,3,6 December 2016,"The Academy Award-winning 1942 motion picture Casablanca has become a legend of filmmaking, almost a part of folklore, by being as perfect a movie as is possible. A triumph of cohesion, not a scene or a line of dialogue is wasted—every single word and frame of film points to the climactic scene in which most of the the cast is present, all plot lines are resolved, and all the picture's mysteries solvedand which many film fans have memorized and can recite, word-for-word. Robert Zemeckis, the director of Paramount's Allied, apparently believes that by fashioning his film on Casablanca, some of the magic of the 1942 picture will rub off on his. It doesn't. And that's a shame, because if the picture were truly a sum of its parts, Allied would be a wonderful experience. But unlike Casablanca, the individual scenes of Allied do not add up to a complete picture. Rather, the diverse parts of the movie look as if they've been snipped from other, better pictures, and cobbled together by screenwriter Steven Knight for Zemeckis to direct. Zemeckis, originally a Steven Spielberg protégé and an acknowledged expert on older movies, gets into the spirit of Knight's script by designing and positioning his shots in a manner reminiscent of scenes from other popular movies. As a director, Robert Zemeckis has always been more derivative than innovative, and any viewer who's seen Algiers or The English Patient, or even Out of Africa or Gone With the Wind, will likely leave Allied with a sense of déjà vu, a nagging suspicion that he or she has seen has seen the picture somewhere else. In Allied, a crack Canadian counterintelligence agent played by Brad Pitt parachutes into French Morocco during the early days of World War II and makes his way to Casablanca to rendezvous with a member of the French resistance, played by Marion Cotillard. Their mission is to do some spy stuff together and then scoot back to London. Naturally they fall in love. And that's just the beginning of a picture which stretches credibility more and more with each of its passing 124 minutes. Allied is a triumph of production design and costuming, but that's really not saying all that much. Pitt and Cotillard are attractive people and they look swell in the picture. When you dress them up in the smartest retro-chic wardrobe and set them loose in the trendiest wartime nightclubs in Casablanca, they look as if they just stepped from the pages of the Giorgio Armani catalogalthough during the daytime scenes they sport elaborate sunglasses which almost scream Hey, we're spies! Which leads to another difficulty with Allied: The anachronisms. In any motion picture, authenticity is essential to maintaining a successful illusion. In Allied, that's where the seams really begin to show. Key sequences take place during nighttime German bombing raids over London in 1942 through 1944—yes, the movie does cover some ground. But nobody seems to realize that the last major German bombing raids on London occurred fairly early in 1941, before Hitler turned east and attacked the Soviet Union. But that's incidental to a picture in which World War II is little more than a plot device to enable the characters to participate illogically in exciting adventures. At one point, for narrow personal reasons Pitt's character steals an RAF airplane and dashes off to occupied France, and then promptly upon arrival accidentally instigates a melee between the French resistance and German soldiers.In the very next scene, Pitt astonishingly appears back in London looking somewhat the worse for wear—exhausted and stylishly disheveled, but without an explanation of what happened to his companions in France or how he got back to England in such a big fat hurry. In reality, had the officer made it back alive he'd undoubtedly have been court-martialed. Pitt's character apparently works for an especially casual branch of the wartime military.And in fact, Pitt's performance begins and ends with his physical appearance and his costuming. The actor looks properly dapper and dashing in his military uniform, and his formal attire and civilian clothing are stylish. But any real attempt at characterization seems to have been left behind either in Pitt's dressing room or in the supermarket tabloids. Marion Cotillard, a genuinely talented actress who received an Academy Award for her performance as Edith Piaf in 2007's La Vie en Rose, reads her lines—especially the occasional subtitled French-language dialogue—with spirit and conviction. But she seems distracted, as if she's trying to remember somewhere else she's supposed to be. In one early scene, Pitt's character is described by Cotillard as a poker-playing expert. As a test, a German agent gives Pitt a deck of cards to shuffle. After a brief pause to gain suspense—Can he do it?—Pitt's character spends the next minute or two performing card maneuvers mesmerizing enough to make Houdini proud. But the filmmakers don't even bother to create the illusion that it's Pitt performing the tricks. Only in the last shot of the scene, in which the actor himself performs one clumsy little shuffle, does Pitt's face appear in the same shot as the cards. That scene can serve as a metaphor for the entire picture. Essentially Allied is a clumsy diversion, a sleight-of-hand trick to distract the viewer from the fact that he's seen it all before, in better movies. Allied is a dumb movie masquerading as a smart one. If you want to see attractive people in stylish clothes and colorful situations, this is the movie for you. But if you want to see a compelling, believable drama about wartime romance, skip it. Or better yet, just watch Casablanca again.",Allied

Two gorgeous lead pair try and give all to make it an emotional saga. Brad and Marion look to be a match made in heaven :-)...the most natural and attractive screen pair (we should have many more flicks for sure). great visuals and Special Effects. Some obvious disappointments are: Brad looks surprisingly tired and no energy or passion in carrying out the required role...too restrained.. and looks quite aged even though his body is quite slim.. i couldn't see the vigor he used to display in his younger ones (he should have shown more passion and response given the circumstances as the role demanded). Marion's role is rather limited but dazzles whenever she is on screen (her background could have been explored further).. as the story doesn't have mystery or aura.. it all fizzles out and the climax is rather timid and no twists and turns (since it was not real and fiction, the story could have been tight and more interesting). Overall i felt the movie lacked that extra thrill and excitement which i definitely feel whenever i watch ""saving private Ryan"", ""the pianist"" or even ""enemy at the gates"".

142,ReelLifeReviews,Just shy of great,7,12 February 2017,"Solid movie with a great performance by Marion Cotillard. It's definitely a love story first and foremost, and a spy movie a distant second. Brad Pitt was a little hit or miss for me. Most of the time he was fine, but there were a couple scenes where he was doing little more than a table read of the script. It's probably a bit too long, but it doesn't drag by any means, just could have been tightened up a bit. Great chemistry (obviously) and well placed tension kept me locked in from start to finish. The emotion was there, but could have been captured so much better. This had the potential to be one of the best dramas of the year, but comes up shy of great.",Allied
143,TimMeade,A Promising Premise Unfulfilled,4,19 December 2016,"Nearly all dud films fall into one of two categories.Sometimes, you sit watching in open-mouthed disbelief that such a pile of rotting effluence ever got a green light – I still break into a cold sweat when I think of the talented Brendan Cowell's clichéd cricket comedy, Save Your Legs.And sometimes it's easy to see what the film was envisaged as being but, somewhere along the way, it just failed to come together.Robert Zemeckis's Allied falls into the latter camp.The story of spies, love and double agents with the backdrop of Casablanca and London in World War Two surely had the hallmarks of a winner. Add the directing pedigree of Mr Zemeckis and a strong, mainly British cast headed by international stars Brad Pitt and Marion Cotillard and you'd probably bank on this one being a commercial and critical blockbuster.Sadly, it just doesn't work.Screenwriter Steven Knight has enjoyed success and Oscar and BAFTA nominations for Dirty Pretty Things. But other work of his has been found wanting – The Hundred Foot Journey, Closed Circuit – were both decidedly mediocre. He has filled Allied with implausible plot devices, unconvincing characters and some pretty average dialogue.The film starts with Brad Pitt, an intelligence officer with the Royal Canadian Air Force, teaming with French Resistance heroine, Marion Cotillard, in Casablanca to assassinate the German Ambassador. Their goal is achieved with too much ease, their escape far too easy as row upon row of German soldiers run into their path to be mowed down like hapless aliens in a computer game. How you longed for an ingenious escape route such as Ryan Gosling's at the start of Drive.Swiftly falling in love, the couple heads to London for marriage, a child and domestic bliss. But this ideal is turned upside down when British Intelligence inform Pitt his wife is suspected as being a German agent. He must feed her false information and then kill her should it become clear she's passed the bait to the Goons; should he fail to do so, he will be hanged for treason. It's preposterous stuff, and following events and the film's denouement are equally ludicrous.Robert Zemeckis must take the blame for the film's poor pacing. Events in the first third of the film in Casablanca whizz by too quickly, but when events move to England, it drags. Zemeckis also has no feel for a war-torn and blitzed London, seemingly unaware of rationing, shortages and severe austerity. The scene of Cockneys round a pub piano singing The White Cliffs of Dover was trying too hard.Cinematography, production values and costumes were good; the actors did their best with the given script. But it wasn't enough to save a film which promised so much.",Allied

145,targe1314,A fresh and stylish throwback to WW II romance movies that doesn't quite deliver,7,5 December 2016,"I really wanted to love this movie. I love the 1940's as an era for both war and romance movies, and with Brad Pitt in the lead, I went in with high hopes.The style of the movie, the sounds, the costumes, the seamless cgi wwII vehicles, are all done to perfection, and for this I was visually thrilled. Seeing an entire airfield of lancaster bombers getting ready for a raid when you know that they do not exist anywhere except inside a computer, is amazing. Similarly, the nighttime German blitz raids on England are visually amazing, except for the one crashing German plane, which I felt was not done perfectly. Sound and music is excellent, from the staccatto bark of a sten submachine gun on single fire to the big band swing 0f 1940's music, to the bam bam bam of antiaircraft fire, the movie is near perfection in both areas.Other than my biggest disappointment which is laughably common, THE BABY! The baby is horrible, she clearly has zero emotional attachment to her fake 'parents' and it is cringeworthy watching the baby scenes, leave it at that.......is Brad Pitt. I dunno what is the deal with this guy, but does he literally need to have a hard-on for the lead actress to properly portray emotion? He is wooden and stilted around her, and it is at times uncomfortable to watch.But so refreshing! The lead is Canadian? What??? Not Save-the-World American? Wow, what a chance they took! Writing and supporting roles are top notch, but again, the supposedly smouldering passion between the two leads is non-existent.",Allied

147,Arcturus1980,One of the best films I have seen,10,26 November 2016,"Robert Zemeckis has helmed a film that is in every respect worthy of his formidable talent and illustrious filmography. With him in the director's chair, Allied's great production values were more or less expected. The film offers beautiful costuming inspired by Casablanca and Now, Voyager, exhilarating action scenes helped by a protagonist who I see as a humanized James Bond, and a very well-told, poignant story of happiness despite a world gone mad. Alfred Hitchcock's 39 Steps and I Confess featured Canadian lead characters. I am not a fan of either film, incidentally, but that entirely sensible aspect is refreshingly mirrored by Brad Pitt's Max Vatan. Such cinematic representations should not irk or for that matter amuse anyone. It is not as though we are boringly eking out some meager existence beyond the great frontier. His talent notwithstanding, I do not recall ever being rah-rah for Brad Pitt, but I greatly appreciate his work here. I really liked Marion Cotillard in Two Days, One Night, and now this very different role. Though Anthony Hopkins once said that he doesn't believe in chemistry between actors, but rather in knowing one's lines, that's too nuts and bolts for me. In the opinion of this cinephile, something very charming is going on here between Pitt and Cotillard. Steven Knight, of Locke and Pawn Sacrifice, gets the only writing credit. Blessed we are to have this man at work. I wish him many more years of it. There is a memorable bit of dialogue in Sergio Leone's A Fistful of Dollars that goes like so: Eastwood's Joe: ""Everybody talks about Ramón."" Volontè's Ramón: ""And many speak of you, too. My dear brother included."" Eastwood's Joe: ""Well, I hope they say . . . nice things."" Whether intended as an homage or not, I was happy to hear Pitt's French-speaking Max respond likewise in a well-written establishing scene. One little aspect of a film that impressed and appealed to me in many ways.",Allied
148,doxxman5,the complex themes on display are much more rewarding that most would have you believe,9,22 March 2017,"Allied has more to do with newer, visceral movie attitudes than one would except by the trailer alone. The setting is vintage Hollywood style films of the 1940's but there is more violence and action than any other Robert Zemeckis movie I can remember. This new phase of Zemeckis career, along with his previous Flight and The Walk, combines the animated qualities of his gorgeous looking Polar Express and Beowulf with a newer feeling of betrayal and misdirection. Another place the movie succeeds is emotion, the audience feels the connection that Pitt's character feels for his wife whether or not she turns out to be a German spy, and the beautiful thing about it is it would work either way.Destined to be written off as old fashioned or generic, looking beyond the simple surface of a film like Allied is to really see the greatness in all movies, as the complex themes on display are much more rewarding that most would have you believe.

I didn't mind the story of how the two leads got together and ended up in Hampstead in the middle of the war. I didn't mind waiting for the crisis to come up where Brad Pitt doesn't know if his wife is a spy or not. But once it does come up, Brad undertakes some pretty far fetched ventures that could undermine the Allies' security even in order to find out. I was even overlooking that. What finally tore it was the way Brad's wife played by Marion Cotillard handles her own dilemma and crisis. She could have sought help or guidance from Brad OR his superiors, totally versed in the very areas she was struggling with. It indicates that she did not trust her husband in spite of the lovey dovey marriage portrayed. Either that, or she was simply a wimp and a wuss. This made the whole movie rather unbelievable. As for the ending of the film with the letter to her daughter especially, that was superfluous and heavy on the treacle, a very obvious attempt to tug at heartstrings in case the audience doesn't already GET that she really loved her daughter.

150,Ben_Cap,Big Stars Can't Save This Big Disappointment,5,27 November 2016,"On paper, Allied should be a great movie. You have a bona fide movie star in Brad Pitt as the leading man and a bona fide movie star in Marion Cotillard as the leading lady. Robert Zemeckis is directing and the setting is one of the most interesting times in human history, WWII. Both play secret agents tasked with taking out a Nazi ambassador in one of the most beautiful cities in the world, Casablanca. Somehow this movie that has so many good things going for it finds ways to disappoint despite having a solid first half. This review is going to have a lot to do with the overall intention of a movie and how it relates to the scores I give out.To begin the first half of the movie is not too bad. It shows how the main characters meet and react to each other with the difficult task ahead of them. There was some interesting tension and cinematic moments that can be appreciated. It was paced really well even with quite a few dialogue sections with some exposition but those moments were juxtaposed with some moments with real tension. For some reason the second half of the movie did not follow suit. I'm not sure if the overall plot got in the way or the studio got in the way but the third act was full of holes and felt on rails.Robert Zemeckis has directed some of the biggest movies of his time, Back to the Future and Forrest Gump to name a few, but I think his age has caught up to him. Allied feels slow and unexciting, even in the high points of the action there seems to be a quick build up with an unexciting pay off. It is not a great looking movie, with some locations either being green screen or just terribly lit. The editing is also not helping but there is really nothing brought by the director that gets the viewer excited.The performances of Brad Pitt and Marion Cotillard are a bit all over the place if only because after that first half they don't spend much time on screen together. Both performances are fine but some of the reactions don't make perfect sense in the context of the story. Really all of the acting is fairly solid and if there is one thing about this movie that is a positive the acting is it.Overall the writing is not terribly great. There are some high moments that like I have mentioned before mostly take place in the first half of the movie. There seem to be entire scenes that are useless and characters seem to constantly be doing things that left me shaking my head. The idea is a great one, two WWII spys who fall in love, who may be taking deep secrets into their post mission affairs is one I can get behind. What ends up playing out in the movie is in some cases infuriating. disappointment.Allied, based on the people involved was supposed to be a huge hit and a possible Oscar contender. The movie comes nothing close to that and does not even fall into the ""decent"" spy thriller genre. Nothing about the characters brings much to be desired and other than the actors playing them are pretty forgettable. I wanted the movie to end up surprising me close to the end with something that would change my opinion of the movie at least a little bit but that moment never came. I don't think the ending of a movie should necessarily define how good a movie is but by the end of Allied I was begging for something off the all to make it all worth it. With quite a few movies being released this holiday season I would recommend you spend your time on something better.",Allied

The action scenes are well done, though they strain credulity as any super-hero movie would. The good guys always come out unscathed and all the bad guys die, but it is a movie, after all. 
Brad Pitt does a good job and now looks the part for more mature roles, his boyish face finally starting to show some age.

With art movies, the loss of money brings something brilliant and memorable, at least, but with these expensive trashes nothing, absolutely nothing is gained.And the part where these actors are so rich they don't need the money at all then why accepting to act in these movies and add something so horrible to their resume, is what makes me wonder the most.",Allied

Robert Zemeckis was able to put together an interesting story between historical war drama and action. The movie it's well directed and the cast works very well. I was a fan of Zemeckis some years ago and i tough he has lost the touch in it's later production but in this one i have really nothing to regret for. The historical environment it's well reproduce and everything it's very believable. The movie moves between an historical war story in the beginning to a drama in the middle to a spy action movie close to the end..and always keeping the viewer stuck in the chair. Well done photography and visual effects ( just the Brad Pitt landing seems in some ways fake) add to the movie some more credibility but what works more it 's a script that create a very enjoyable entertainment",Allied

Allied is everything you want in one action/drama/romance title. Great movie to be watched with your partner or by yourself if you like the genre. It is as surprising as it sounds typical because of the WW2 ambiance which is not that much typical in this movie in fact. Brad Pitt starts his performance a bit off but i must say he blended in his role so good while the movie progresses i believed him no matter what... Marion Cotillard was great in her role and great choice i must say...Overall, beginning - progress - ending considered, it worth-ed every penny i gave for this movie, and i advise couples to go this movie in cinema too.

Brad Pitt & Marion Cotillard are outstanding actors so it was a win win for me to go see this historical movie. I was drawn in right from the moment the two of the lead characters meet in Morocco. Pitt hardly had any lines at the beginning of the movie and after 10 minutes I knew why. Unfortunately as good as he is he just couldn't get the french accent believable enough to fool me let alone a french person from France. His Quebecois french was just as cringe worthy. Somehow the two just didn't seem suited to each other as lovers either. The chemistry just wasn't there. I often wish I could assist in selecting the actors. Brad Cooper, Tom Hiddleston, Hugh Jackman all speak french & would have been some of my choices. Marion Cotillard held her own as she always does. In the end I have to say that I liked the movie...just think Brad should have been sitting beside me watching it instead of staring in it.",Allied
163,lorraineesimpson,Another Hollywood take on wartime,6,26 August 2017,"Visually this film is a treat. The Moroccan (in reality Gran Canarian) landscape, the blitz scenes and leafy Hampstead all look great. Oh and of course the actors; Pitt definitely looks better with age, the blue-eyed prettiness of youth having given way to a chiselled-jaw handsomeness. Cotillard is chocolate box perfection, glamorously beautiful in every scene. The acting is generally good, although a little hammy in bits, particularly from Pitt who veers a bit too far into Top Gun territory at some points but I think the script is primarily the culprit here, and in fact the script is probably the weakest part of this film. Well, that and the plot which doesn't really make sense ... particularly towards the end where I think it's far more likely that the British would have turned the situation to their advantage with the D Day mission just round the corner. There is a fair bit of silliness in this film. Although swearing is nothing new, the F word was not in common use in 1940's Britain, and would have attracted disapproving looks as a minimum, particularly if used in mixed company. Homosexuality is as old as time itself but in Britain at least it was kept mainly behind closed doors until fairly recently, so the openly lesbian sister and her lover was an unlikely (and somewhat unnecessary) touch - although I have to correct a previous reviewer who commented on homosexuality being illegal during this period. It was indeed illegal in Britain during this period, but was defined as sexual relations between men. Lesbianism was not recognised in British law, so it would be social, rather than legal, factors which made this unlikely. Open displays of same sex affection might have occurred at the more bohemian London parties but definitely not in the pub! The same can also be said for drugs and sex. Yes, these things all happened and yes wartime and the threat of imminent destruction made people more reckless but what the director ignores is British social attitudes at that time and which prevailed for several decades thereafter. Despite the negatives this is an enjoyable film and very watchable. It's Hollywood trying to do history which rarely works, so as a period piece this is a fail, but it's entertaining enough.",Allied

Worst part of this movie is director attempting to shove the gay-lesbianism in the movie by showing two women openly living together in a lesbian setup, which was not possible in the 40s as society was not (yet) tamed to accept these affairs socially.

The first is the ""big"" films with A-list stars, exotic locations, and endless CGI-sequences that try to compensate for the lack of plot and character development. The second is ""small"" films, often with A- list stars, and real plots and character development but with very modest production values.In contrast, Allied hearkens back to the days when Hollywood actually made ""Movies"" (with a capital M) that featured A-list actors, exotic locations, great stories, characters, suspense, romance, high production values and more!The story starts in Morocco (although filmed in the Canary Islands) and follows Brad Pitt, a Canadian intelligence office, and Marion Cotillard, a Resistance fighter, and is a bit reminiscent of Casablanca. After a very successful special mission, they develop a romantic relationship and move to London.All goes well until information surfaces that suggests Cotillard may actually be a German spy. If it turns out to be true, then – under the ""Intimate Betrayal Rule"" – Pitt must execute Cotillard himself, or face his own execution.

Moreover the events of the movie doesn't make any sense. If anyone of you has an understanding of wars, conflicts, politics and national duty, you will find this movie appalling.

But Pitt seems to be specializing himself in Nazi-killer roles, where he can shoot around just anyone with no moral implications, making the plot to lose most of its human dimension. I have no problem with going once and again to those old good days where Britons win, so they can keep their heads up against evil Germans at least in the dark of a movie theater, but I am personally growing sick of those trigger-happy macho-type die-hard and would welcome some deeper plot where human lives count.

Pitt and Cottillard are easy on the eyes, but so wooden. Particularly Pitt. I never thought he was a true ""actor"" - more of a awesome male specimen -- and this film did nothing to change my opinion of him. Nice to look at, but no range in his acting ability. She on the other hand is a good actress, but I think the direction and the script boxed her in this time.The CGI wasn't necessary for what is essentially a drawing room drama and they were terribly noticeable and distracting. The costumes were incredible -- but almost over the top for two people in their stations in life. It's hard to conceive to a military man being able to afford such suits and topcoats in war-torn London. And his wife would have similarly had to be frugal in her clothes by necessity. But not in Hollywood -- money is no object when it comes to dressing these two.I'd rather watch Casablanca again.",Allied
171,Hbarker-32233,Fundamentally pleasing but often distracting,7,21 December 2016,"A fascinating hybrid of bleeding-edge technology and old-fashioned flair, Robert Zemeckis' Allied drags a defiantly retro WWII drama into the 21st century with shimmering digital embellishments that only occasionally distract. A few f-bombs aside, Steven Knight's screenplay wouldn't feel out of place in 1943. But instead of the back-projection, process photography and matte paintings common to films of that era, Zemeckis indulges in the artifice of ones and zeros, creating impossible trick-shots and virtual landscapes that rival his computer-animated adventures. Allied looks just as fakey as a forties movie, but fakey in a different, more modern way. There's a reason it contains so many references to Casablanca — the techno-pioneer is deliberately making a case for his kind of digital filmmaking as part of the classic Hollywood tradition. Sometimes he even convinced me.Brad Pitt stars as the magnificently named Max Vatan, Wing Commander in the Royal Canadian Air Force on a top-secret mission in Morocco. He's assigned to pose as the husband of French Resistance fighter Marianne Beauséjour, played by the impossibly gorgeous Marion Cotillard with Sphinx-like inscrutability. The first act of Allied finds these two weary warriors skeptically sniffing around each other, trained not to trust but hot and bothered all the same. Their flirtation culminates in a front-seat tryst quite amusingly set during a sandstorm, Zemeckis' ""camera"" spinning circles around them inside the cramped car –where a physical camera could never fit– as the winds rage outside. It's a slick bit of how-did-he-do-that showmanship, though admittedly not very sexy.Like most Zemeckis pictures, Allied is something of a cold fish – a cleverly engineered contraption unconcerned with the characters' inner lives. The story picks up steam a couple years later when Marianne is accused of being a German spy, her now-actual-husband Max given only a weekend to prove his wife's innocence before he'll be forced to execute her himself. Knight's script boasts a nifty ticking-clock structure with some satisfying reversals, and it's refreshing to see a WWII movie with such a narrow focus. Allied isn't trying to make some sort of grandiose statement about war or reach for any contemporary parallels, it's just a claustrophobic thriller with a historical backdrop.This is the kind of tense, talky story that once upon a time would have been shot quickly on Hollywood soundstages. Zemeckis uses digital wizardry to visually goose along the proceedings with results both eye-popping and absurd. It's a bit much when Cotillard gives birth in the middle of a London street while everything around is blown to bits during the Blitz, but I quite admired a complex outdoor party sequence illuminated by an air raid miles off in the distance. (Be forewarned the shindig's random fixation on coke-sniffing and lesbian makeout sessions call to mind those leering scenes in Flight that made Zemeckis come off like a creepy uncle.) Cotillard is perfectly elegant and opaque, but by design the story can't give her too much to play. This isn't one of Pitt's better performances, all growly and aloof in ways that counteract his charisma. He's also harmed by Zemeckis' bizarre affinity for digitally airbrushing actors, giving all his close-ups a blurry, smeared effect like that filter your friends use to try and look younger on Instagram. Last I checked Brad Pitt was still a good-looking guy, and even if he's a few years too old for the role that's no reason to have the F/X crew make him Benjamin Button again.Leaving aside a sentimental epilogue that feels borrowed from a much softer, sappier picture, Allied hums along quite nicely thanks to the kind of cleanly efficient, old-school storytelling that's almost extinct at the multiplex these days. For all Zemeckis' digital ornamentation, he's still got a classicist's knack for how to pace out a suspense sequence. A late-movie plane crash is indeed spectacular (though notably only the third-most effective plane crash this director has filmed) yet the film works even better in simpler, more low-tech moments, like during a complicated break-in when you've got Pitt listening for footsteps upstairs.Allied's innovations point to the future of cinema, but its pleasures are in the fundamentals.",Allied
172,mjsmjs-46362,one wrong turn after another,3,28 November 2017,"I'm surprised at the number of positive reviews of this film, like it's on par with Casablanca or something, because frankly,this movie is garbage. Weak acting, weak dialogue and a very weak story at best.The movie did have decent potential, but it seemed to take a wrong turn every chance it got. The acting is bland and uninspired, they appear to be forcing themselves through it just for the paycheck with no real interest or investment in the characters they are portraying. In Brad Pitt's defense, he can deliver strongly with the right character in the right movie ( Fight Club, Snatch, Inglorious Bastards ) but this wasn't a good character for him to begin with. He has about as much zest as a statue in this role, and it doesn't help that his (alleged) Botox enhancements make him look like he's having a bad anaphylactic reaction to some peanuts or shellfish. The story was about as poorly constructed as you can get. It was so ridiculous and implausible that any suspension of disbelief one needs to watch a fictitious movie goes right out the window. The basic plot itself is ludicrous....His superiors want him to kill his own wife and mother of his child after they confirm she is a spy? Really? Yeah, because nothing could go wrong with that strategy, right? Please. Now, I'm no military intelligence operative, but I'm pretty sure that's about the last strategy they would use in a situation like that. And it doesn't get any better after that bomb is dropped, either. The ending was especially poor....they could have chosen about a hundred different ways to end this movie, but just like all the nonsense before it, they did it in the worst way possible.

It is a movie that will appeal to adults, both men and women, and it includes romance, sacrifice, and plenty of action and spy hi jinks. A very good script, with some great plot turns, and superior acting from both Marion Cotillard and Brad Pitt in complex, challenging roles. My favorite bit: when they make love in a car in the Moroccan desert with a sandstorm going on all around them. It is a good metaphor for their love story in the midst of the great chaos of World War II. And it has a realistic feel, for the most part--for the sets in Casablanca (some good homage to the Bogart film, I would say also some Brando homage in parts of Pitt's performance), and the time back in the UK (second favorite bit is during a party in London). One does get the sense of the all-out effort demanded to win the war, something we do well to commemorate in these days when the last veterans of that most epic event in history are at death's door. It is a Zemeckis film, from the school of film-making of Steven Spielberg, and that means your emotions are subject to the whim and whimsy of the director's manipulation. Sometimes you are aware of that, but oftentimes you are not, and that makes it better (than, say, Forrest Gump).

176,lokilfa,Mostly Harmless,5,31 January 2017,"Spy stories set in the 2nd world war are somewhat a genre by themselves, here we have one of the more psychological persuasion rather than an action packed one. It is in fact based on the intimate relationship between the two leads rather than their daring feats. Allied is a very average movie that would not involve you one bit in the fate of this couple. That is a striking achievement given all the talent in front and behind the camera.Allied should be studied and dissected in film schools as one of the most interesting oddities. Why money plus talent is success only on paper.Why the public is not compelled to care about these characters? The story in itself, if you had just the script in your hands, is not particularly original or well built but neither it is a dull and boring story. While genre and cultural clichés are constantly applied those do not necessarily undermine the result. There are no particularly strong plot points but sometimes is better safe than sorry. A bit of confusion towards the end if anything wrong. No smoking gun here.Photography is technically very good, some desert outdoors are even fascinating and French Morocco in the 40s is altogether well depicted, yet some of the cracks in this movie appear instantly: in its very classical and rigid framing you do not get personal with the actors, the camera is mostly going for medium and long shots, very well filmed and yet somehow distant and descriptive rather than immersive. Not what is needed, feels fake. Mind you, masterfully faked but still The acting is what really stops this movie from being a classic of its genre. Brad Pitt is a piece of stone sporting one of his worst acting feat. He has a terrible and unbelievable french accent, if you do not speak French I suppose it is endurable. Far worse are his reactions to events and pressure and worst of all his chemistry with Marion Cotillard. She pulls off an adequate performance but nothing more. Since the whole thing should be about what goes on between them the movie sinks. The whole seduction part goes nowhere and it is filmed from as far away as possible. The love scene might even work but is built on choreography alone and in the end does not have much impact. Supporting characters are mostly useless stereotypes without much to do.Allied is a quietly, pleasantly boring movie that will be soon forgotten for good. No Casablanca here.",Allied

After the first third of the movie I started to wonder how I managed to sit through it... and then came the rest.What's wrong with this movie? Almost everything. I was looking forward to watching it because I like both actors and this type of film, but actually both Pitt and Cotillard seemed like they weren't themselves - like they forgot how to act all of a sudden. They're both terrific actors so what the hell happened?The story itself was about I don't know what, to be honest. There were too many things happening that were just loosely connected, there was no real structure, no real drama or tension. It was more or less as 'dramatic' as the quite horrible 'Ask the dust' with Colin Farrell and Salma Hayek, which was also a badly acted melodramatic period piece with a terrible script. Visually the movie is beautiful and I understand why a lot of people like it: it's because it's not that obvious at first glance what's so wrong with this movie. It seems kind of good but then if you think about it a little, you realize it's actually just plain awful. The story is disjointed, the love between the leads doesn't look real at all, and the worst thing is that everything that the characters go through seems utterly pointless in the end.

He's got some talent, but his screenplays and their authors need to be allowed to insert a bit more life and wit into the works. That being said, the final suspense sequences with Cotillard waiting for her husband in the car are so good, it comes close to being forgiven for its horribly muddled storytelling.

187,DoctorMeticulous,"A solid drama, not an action film.",8,1 April 2017,"The key to understanding and appreciating Allied is knowing what kind of film it is. The trailers made the film look like it was a genre film -- some hybrid of a wartime action and espionage film. But it isn't either of these. It is simply a drama about two people in the context of WWII, how they come to trust one another, and what happens when that trust is put in question. In the same way that Flight (another good Zemeckis film) was made by its trailer to look like a courtroom drama instead of a dramatic character study, the trailer for Allied misled the public as to what the film was about, and that's never a recipe for customer satisfaction. If you take the film on its own merits, at face value, I don't think you'll be disappointed. The performances are good, the period sets and costumes are outstanding, the cinematography is more than attractive, and the script is suspenseful and moving. It may not be the world's greatest film, but I did not feel cheated by it in any way, and you'll probably be fine as long as you're not expecting something like one of the Mission:Impossible films. Like some of the films directed by Pitt's friend, George Clooney (e.g. The Good German and Goodnight & Good Luck), Allied hearkens back to character-driven Hollywood dramas of the 1940s and 50s.

As quoted from the film's costume designer, Joanna Johnston during an interview with Fashionista: ""I wanted to ground it in the time, but I also wanted to give it its own look, so you kind of pick and mix, in that regard.

Nothing was a straight copy, it was a whole load of different influences or parts that go into making your interpretation for the film."".Brad Pitt and Marion Cotillard both looked lavishly good, with their dresses and suits they both resemble power and class. Cotillard, notably, seemed to fit on every dresses, and no matter what you make her wear, she remains stunningly gorgeous.Pitt and Cotillard had their share of talent throughout the film, even though the romantic charisma between the two didn't spark that bright, they were still able to carry and effectively played their role in a very compelling manner.As the biggest revelation unravels, the couple tried their best to save their relationship by running away, but only then that they realized that their love is not just built on survival, but also by sacrifice.",Allied
189,GooseReviews,Disappointment,3,24 May 2017,A movie directed by Robert Zemeckis. Starring Brad Pitt and Marion Cotillard. The movie tells us a story of agents who met on a mission to kill German Ambassador in Casablanca during World War II and fall in love. After returning to London their relationship is tested. It was boring and predictable movie. I couldn't see the chemistry between main characters. And I was feeling a lack of something in the whole movie. I was expecting a lot from it but I was disappointed.,Allied
190,polinka,"I didn't expect Casablanca, but it was not even a war love tragedy",6,7 February 2017,"I blame the director,the script,the editors,and the carelessness about details. I love both main actors,- but here they are not coming through as believable.Marion Cotillard is a superb actress and even in this movie,she does her job,- but even she looks as trying too hard. Brad Pitt is supposed to be ""restrained"" and cool(after all he is a spy,and a pilot and a commander), but he is...absent,even in the love scenes; and in the end (that meant to be painful),he is not convincing.He seems as if his mind is somewhere else. The story has such great potential, and it is wasted! Their time in Casablanca seems too staged (I loved the costumes, so...); the meeting with the German ambassador is not trustworthy at all, and the attack lacks suspense and goes so smoothly..(empty streets all around, in an Arab city after an explosion; really?) London:the language is too modern, the behaviour of people-even considering the war-is not as open.Women openly together? maybe in Berlin before the Nazis,in Paris or even in London in bohemian circles,- but never like it was portrayed here(in the military?in the 40s?come on!). Even more annoying,- it added nothing to the story! So why I give it a 6.5? Because in general the story is good and has so much more to it(if it was other hands),because the small things-like Max's attempt to find the truth, showed a bit the ugly part of the war (when he sends the young pilot,when he meets Guy in the hospital),and Marion's acting is still worth notice. It is watchable, keeps you interested, but the holes in the story are too big to make you emotional and sympathetic with the characters (and I am a very emotional person), to make it a good movie. 6.5/10",Allied
191,sheppard-2,Zemeckis masterfully plays on our emotions over an empty and superficial story,6,27 November 2016,"A masterful play on the watcher's emotion. But in the end you feel it was completely superficial and probably made just for the sake of playing on emotions. Even though the emotions were severe. And not pleasant, I have to say. About 15 minutes into the movie, I said it was probably a horror film - this was the kind of emotion it caused. Brad Pitt and Marion Cotillard play really well, everything is done perfectly, but you cannot relate to their characters. Why do they decide to marry each other? Why would they have a kid? No idea. And yet, I cried and cried, and even more so in the end. And then I thought - maybe what Zemeckis says with this film is that it's too easy to cause us to feel emotions? This movie is not about its characters or story or wartime - it might be about us as viewers? Bitter, unpleasant, but a bit weak and not convincing in this case.",Allied
192,mydistracteduniverse,Positively surprised by Allied,9,26 December 2016,"When I saw the trailer for Allied for the first time I knew I had to watch the movie. The story sounded intriguing and lets face it – its no hardship to watch Brad Pitt on the screen, big, small or otherwise. The man certainly is ageing well.As I sat down to watch the movie I thought that I knew what was going to happen. I was wrong. I did not know. It is a beautifully scripted and executed story with multiple layers that are interwoven to complete the picture in an unexpected way.The storySet in a time of great peril Allied tells the story of Max Vatan (Brad Pitt) and Marianne Beausejour, played by Marion Cotillard. They are thrown together on a secret mission to assassinate the German Ambassador in Casablanca, Morocco in the midst of World War 2. Their cover story has them pose as husband and wife.While they prepare for their mission they grow close and fall in love. Once the Ambassador is out of the way Max asks her to come to London with him to be his real wife. He serves in the army head quarter as a wing commander with the Canadian Air Force. Their daughter is born during an air raid, with debris flying all around them. They settle into a blissfully happy life. Nothing seems to stand in the way of their happiness.Until the day when Max gets called into the office and is informed that Marianne is suspected to be a German double agent. He is tasked to run a 'blue dye' on her or face to be executed for treason himself. He is to feed her false information and entrap the woman he loves so desperately.The two characters met on a secret spy mission. It is ironic that their happiness is threatened by the accusation of her being a double agent for the enemy.Final thoughtsBrad Pitt gives an outstanding performance in his portrayal of a man who is about to loose everything he holds dear. At first disbelieving he battles his arising doubts and distrust as he sets out to prove Marianne's innocence.Marion Cotillard is wonderful in her role of the beautiful and brave resistance fighter who wants nothing more than to settle down with her husband and their child. It is the first movie I have seen with her in, as far as I am aware of, and I am really impressed by her performance I have to say. I am looking forward to seeing her next in January, when she has a role in Assassin's Creed together with Michael Fassbender.Allied is about the age old saying that love conquers all. It is a story about a time full of violence and war. In a time when enemies are fierce and stakes are high, we see the story unfold in front of a haunting background. It reminds me a bit of the iconic movie Casablanca, in more ways than one. They don't make movies like that anymore very often.Luckily Paramount made Allied. It is a timeless story that will become a classic one day. I'm sure of it. It certainly deserves it.",Allied

The engine of the movie took a little to start, but when it started was outstanding.
Spies, love and war, well mixed, an explosive combination, I never knew what was going to happen and, most important I was always looking forward to discover it. I totally was catched by it and at the end I admit I was moved and spilled a couple of tears: pretty much an overwhelming history.
Brad and Marillon are outstanding, they really appears as spies used to hide who they are and what they're thinking and doing.
The explosive combination is explosive for the unexpected plot twist. That's too bad, because the fact that I know how it end will spoil the rewatches of this movies, because I will watch it again for sure.
Hope you enjoy too.",Allied
194,resireg-31415,Disappointing propaganda,1,23 August 2017,"I just watched "" allied"" yesterday on Netflix. I was frustrated. The movie portray Brad Pitt as an almost super human hero, capable of killing so many professional and heavily armed soldiers on his own. Normally when you are outnumbered, at least you get hurt, but not him. He makes German soldiers look incompetent, stupid and useless (if they were that weak, how come it took 6 years of fighting to defeat them?). Marion Cotillard is supposed to be a German woman pretending to be French. How come she leaves a letter to her daughter in a language that is not her first (German) or even second (French). It would make more sense if the movie showed some of her German traits that would make it more plausible that she was not who she claimed to be.There is a scene that is quite cruel, when Brad Pitt executes half a dozen injured German soldiers who were not a threat anymore (the rules of the engagement normally says that you make them prisoners of war). The Canadian and British army was famous for not being ruthless with their prisoners (different than Russians for example). Normally they would shoot to kill when in combat, but there are hardly cases of war crimes and merciless, sadistic killing. That didn't seemed historically accurate.Then, there are the handlers, a very old lady (Mrs. Sinclair) and another old jeweler, who are murdered without being judged by the proper authorities (they probably could be hanged, but normally you interrogate them first, since they can collaborate and snitch on more secret agents in UK).I felt that Robert Zemeckis wanted to make a movie about good guys versus bad guys, but he just couldn't convince me that some French citizens in Morocco, who tried to get along with their occupied government (the Vichy Republic) deserved to be killed for that. I felt more compassion than pleasure for their deaths.",Allied

The main lead did a good job - as expected.Apparently this movie was a big flop at the box office which could be attributed to its trailer.

201,robert-temple,Brad Pitt sleepwalks through an entire film,5,6 April 2017,"This film has a powerful story, many stunning scenes, and Marion Cotillard. But it also has Brad Pitt. Big mistake. Not only does Pitt seem to have had his face worked on, so that it can show little emotion anymore, but he is also apparently not Brad Pitt anymore. Is this a zombie who has taken his place? He plays opposite Marion Cotillard in countless intimate scenes, she tries every device she can think of to wake him up, but still he slumbers. A cardboard cutout of the Brad Pitt we used to know would have been more effective. Considering that this is a film wholly dependent upon the relationship between Pitt and Cotillard, the result is a disaster. The chemistry between them is so far below absolute zero that we are in a deeply frozen universe. Meanwhile, an enormous crew and the director Robert Zemeckis (famous for FORREST GUMP and BACK TO THE FUTURE) struggle to hold back the Red Sea so that the entire cast do not drown in a sea of indifference. We have the excellent Jared Harris, beloved of all MAD MEN fans, adding his resonant voice which is as soothing as hot chocolate, but lacking closeups, so that we can barely see him. We have Gary Sinese, an old chum of Zemeckis. We even have Simon McBurney. But still there is no thaw. We have great scenes. There is sex inside an old car in the middle of a sandstorm in the desert (lacking however any continuity link to the succeeding scenes, which is both an editing and a directing lapse). There is a birth of a baby in the open in the middle of an air raid. There is a man landing on a sand dune by parachute, seen from the air as he descends (astonishing camera work) which is ostensibly in Morocco but was really filmed in the Canary Islands, where all the North African locations were simulated. (There are in any case no such sand dunes near Casablanca, just for the record.) And there is a plane coming straight at a house but which misses its roof by a whisker and crashes across the street. That street is Willow Road in London's Hampstead, where so much action takes place. I could not make out whether the house was meant to be that of my friend Rupert Sheldrake, but I must go have a look at his roof to see whether it is damaged. Later when we see baby Anna taking her first steps, with the wrecked German plane in the background, it is on a hill far from Willow Road, but then this is only a movie. This is a film which should have been fantastic. But it has no pace, it is in fact languid and lingering. It is meant to be a powerful thriller and intense personal drama, but where is the editing to keep it going, where are the intense angles, and above all, where is the hero? Sound asleep, of course. Yes, there are plenty of spectacular setups. Many people worked their butts off giving us great sets, great props, great clothes, wonderful period cars. There are searchlights and anti-aircraft guns slaving away for our benefit, there are Sten guns, Nazis, stern 'V Section' spooks, uniforms, pistols, the whole shebang. But where are the pace, the intensity, and the excitement? All the elements are there, but we wait in vain for it all to move us. This is a passionless film. I also think Steven Knight's screenplay was greatly lacking in any true cinematic sense, and that he is just not a natural writer for the screen, despite having numerous credits. What a waste of a wonderful opportunity this is. And all that money spent on it! Zemeckis rolls scene after scene onstage as if he were producing a variety show in a theatre, or reading from Steven Knight's shopping list, and expects them all to adhere. But they are episodic rather than unified. We go from one outstanding setup to another. But we do not do so quickly enough, there is not enough glue, and above all, the nearest thing to a meaningful Pitt which we see in this film, vaguely and in the distance, are the ones on Jared Harris's face, remembered from MAD MEN, where we all learned to find them endearing marks of his individuality. Marion Cotillard deserves an Oscar for trying. But she might as well be kissing a film poster, and even a rag doll would be more responsive to her embraces. All of her plentiful allure is just so much water thrown at the desert sands, disappearing instantly and leaving no trace. If one pretends all the flaws are not there, one can still just about enjoy this film because of its dramatic and tragic story. But its lack of vigour just makes it look so contrived.",Allied

Wasn't sure it was my kind of movie until I discovered Bob Zemeckis directed then I thought I'd give it a shot. Brad Pitt is such a watchable actor these days and Marion Cotilliard has a unique presence about her that allows the story to move effortlessly from one scene to the next with total believability and sincerity. Once the story settles in London it is fascinating to see what I believe and hope the atmosphere and visuals were during that period if the war. The director has such a varied and glittering back catalogue that I firmly believe he researched the time period and got it exactly right. The ending was tough to watch after investing so much in the characters but I guess that's what movies are all about. Well worth a watch for anybody who appreciates top class storytelling and I would quite honestly describe this as a modern classic, albeit set 75yrs ago!",Allied
203,TADKALABS,A Period Spy Saga that's strictly Above Average !,7,7 July 2019,"When it is a world war 2 time's Spy saga, helmed by Brad Pitt & Marion Marion Cotillard with Robert Zemeckis behind Camera, you will be brimming with excitement and anticipation of a well told & well-made story that befits everybody's lofty standards. Well it does but just above average. This potboiler, resembles Casablanca a lot but made little different in terms of plot that unfolds a little different.The movie opens to the premise of both the spies Pitt & Marion enacting the roles of a Married French Couple. With that as the background where both are pitted behind enemy lines to do an encore with the Nazis where Pitt is a Canadian RAF Wing Commander and Marion as French Resistance operative, pull off an assassination coup with perfect finesse & understanding that they both fall in love and get married post that daring operation and escape from there. Back in UK they do get married and have a child (The child birth happens when the German air raid is happening and, in a half, shelled hospital and bombs are getting dropped left and right. Looks kind of dramatic). Then then settle in such a neighbourhood of London, which is a war time settlement for Jewish intellects, free mind European refugees, artists, haute couture types, other various freethinkers and free-lovers. Then the Brits suspect her to be a spy on British Military now and is double crossing her unsuspecting husband since the WW2 is still ON. How the movie unfolds from there and heads towards a climax forms the rest of the story in 2nd half.Marion has put in a pretty enigmatic performance which does look flawless at times and unconvincing at times. Pitt is kind of below par in his performance may be since knowing his acting prowess we expect more from him. Though the movie is flawless in terms of technicalities with vintage frames & locales and camera angles that transform you to the WW2 period with no room for any errors including even the camera work & editing. The Technical brilliance of Zemeckis shine bright when that aspect is considered. He also deftly covers the blind faith and the bonding that forms the basis of a relationship, the trust factor which holds and some times blinds the relationship angle into fine tuning that with of suspicions that form part and parcel of spying and how they raise their head in family background...et all with consummate ease which Zemeckis can pull off in a very fine tuned fashion. But something lacks with Brad which is little difficult to pin point. He comes across as more technical than heart in it kind of performance, overall.Had Pitt put in a little more INVOLVED performance as finely honed that he is in acting which he is known for, this movie would have upped the bar that high which we know he is capable of but alas. It falls a TRIFLE SHORT to drive home that nuanced plot which Zemeckis wants to drive home that with personal lives of spying as profession couple makes it difficult to trust even the life partner you think that you know fully well and that speck of doubt and devil in the detail & nagging DOUBT remain a CONSTANT without ever ceasing to exist, even after your JOB/PROFESSIONAL DUTY does. Having said that its not a passe but it keeps you engrossed for most of its almost 2 hour run time. Zemeckis has taken very little freedom to express this saga of history, passion, despair and war story and kept it almost true to the period it belongs to, with very little deviation in the form of allegiance & Constance to history 😊",Allied
204,mxbishop,Allied Chick Flick,4,25 November 2016,"This is a short review. The single most important thing missing from this film is any kind of chemistry between Brad Pitt and Marion Cotillard. Without that chemistry, even as a romantic chick flick, this movie fails. Secondly, any student of WWII history knows that the German Blitz over England pretty much ended in May of 1941, and yet this movie has London being blitzed multiple times in 1943. That did not seem likely. On the positive side, there are some nice sets, and costumes, and some moments of tension.

Very elegant, warm, loving and beautiful. Beautiful and handsome actors, colourfully rich and interesting setting and complementing dialogues between the main characters. There is a good balance between the simplicity of how the events unfold and the depth of emotions presented. There are definitely room for improvement and some less interesting scenes but it didn't stop me from enjoying the movie as it is.

209,rangeriderr,Excellently Directed with a Stupid Storyline,4,18 November 2017,"I watched the first hour of this movie, and although it was beautifully photographed and well-directed, it seemed to move very slowly for an espionage movie. Something about it didn't ring true, so I read the summary and quit watching the rest.The first tip-off is the surname given to Brad Pitt: ""Vatan"". This movie is set during WWII. How many wing commanders in 1942 would have had a Turkish or Iranian name in England at that time? The name given to the co- star in the film is ""Beausejour"" meaning ""beautiful stay"". I ask, ""Did the writers intend that this name should have some significance?"" I couldn't figure it out. As other reviews may tell you, a totally obnoxious executive from the British Special Operations Executive (SOE) tells Vatan that his wife is a German spy. And if Vatan is not prepared to expose his wife, we see the SOE guy open a drawer with a gun in it, implying that he was prepared to kill Vatan on the spot. Here comes the illogical part, as I give away the essence of the end of the film.Vatan and Beausejour are now living in London and they have a one year old daughter, Anna. It turns out that the Germans threatened Beausejour with harming their daughter if she didn't spy for them. She kept this a secret from her husband, and the movie proceeds from there to its depressing conclusion. Now, I ask you, ""What would happen logically in real life?"" The wife would tell her husband of the German threat who would then relate this to his superior, and they all would wind up working with the SOE on how to have Beausejour fool the Germans with meaningless British ""intelligence"". (Another issue was raised to which I did not find the answer. SOE claimed that Vatan's wife wasn't the real Beausejour.)The excitement in a more logical movie would revolve around the issue of ""How long can the British continue to fool the Germans and not have something dire happen to the child, Anna?"" I think that could be a much more intelligent movie which would move along at a faster pace.",Allied

She was conflicted, but we don't get to see much of this internal conflict -- rather the story follows the male lead, Max Vatan, played by Bradd Pitt.

223,troyhoch,Ails from its boring and slow-pace,5,2 December 2017,"""Allied"" has tons of talent that simply disappoints. Brad Pitt was surprisingly absolutely wooden in this film, frustrating me throughout. The chemistry in the romance between him and Marion Cotillard was not genuine at all, and felt fake. Pitt's bland performance left Cotillard as the one and only star of the film, but she does not benefit from low screen time, as the story is all about Max Vatan (Brad Pitt). Director Robert Zemeckis creates a love story to the classic film ""Casablanca"" but in the end becomes a wanna-be of sorts. There are too many scenes in the film that try to convince the audience over and over again that the romance between Pitt and Cotillard is real, but continually feels insincere. The plain and predictable third act does not relieve the film one bit, showing that the film could have been cut in half and still met its same end. It's slow, old-fashioned, and bores the audience frequently. ""Allied"" is not good or bad, just mediocre, which let me down completely, as I was expecting a classic wartime story.",Allied

This is an excellent film that is very much worth watching.The war film genre, especially the ww2 war film genre, is not filled with a high proportion of truly great films - most descend to low brow action, jingoism and gratuitous content where any kind of thoughtful investigation of the characters' personalities, motivations et c. are left out.Here is a film with an uncharacteristically low key, subtle and relatively flat content and plot line as we watch the characters interacting as time passes - we are presented with repeated scenes of Marianne (Cotillard) and Max (Pitt) talking, smoking, making love, making war and hanging out domestically - the result is we get a rather detailed insight into how these two live through what they are going through (not a typical war film agenda). The acting is impeccable, the script excellent and the production values very well done - the result very moving. Highly recommended.",Allied
226,tecktomaket,Allied,8,5 September 2017,"Allied depicts historical events during WWII. Even parachuting into Morocco. I am not disappointed with this film but enjoy its plausibility because I have studied clandestine operations conducted by the French and British. These characters roles ring true. Keeping ones cover is paramount-the romance and falling in love are possible. Remember Pitt's character had flown to France to supply the Resistance so he was involved with ongoing military interventions. Pitt is no Humprey Bogart but he's a definitive actor that maintains notability in each of his films. Provided Marion takes the spotlight - remember a co-star down playing their role elevates these interactions. Many military attaches' were rotated in the European theater for purposes of keeping their covers intact. The scene where Pitt kills the Nazi officer because his cover was blown speaks to this. Marion's character has an excellent arch-being a counter spy blackmailed into continuing to protect their child. Sophie's Choice twist.The plot speaks to why spies ought not to fall in love, the risk and lies they live out catch up to the truth sooner or later. ""Both people f' each other and now they're dead"" Pitts line-referring to what happens when spy's fall in love-at the breakfast table. Script and plot points are in sync. Music is balanced. A seamless edit.In a world of SS Nazi suspicion of everyone - civilian men must act reserved to save their skin; beautiful women can be flamboyant.Especially when it comes to cutting the deck... metaphorically speaking.""Max, you're a bloody fool.""

232,aarneai,Disappointed,6,3 October 2018,"I have to start by saying that I was hoping for more. The actors were great, the setting was great, the idea was great but the final product is just lacking in almost every way possible. I think that it's a shame because this could've been one of the best movies in its genre had it just been a bit better at everything it tried to do.Allied takes place during the final years of World War 2. Now, this is a period of history that I have always found to be very interesting and thus, I have always sought after movies that take place in that period. So it's fair to say that I was rather excited when this film first came out. After reading first reviews and hearing what people thought about it I got somewhat discouraged and completely forgot about it until Netflix recommended it for me. I will say that I'm glad that I've seen it and can now judge it myself. It wasn't bad in the ways that I was expecting it to be, but it is far from perfect.Firstly, Brad Pitt felt a tad bit bored. There isn't anything wrong with his performance but it just didn't feel particularly interesting.
Secondly, there are times when Allied feels incredibly slow moving. Perhaps if the movie had been 10-15 minutes shorter it would've been better. The beginning is good, the early bit of action is good and the ending, I thought, was very well done. However, most of the stuff in between could've been done much quicker and the film would have had a better flow.
Finally, I have to credit the visuals of this film. The costume design is brilliant, the world makes you feel like you are in the Second World War and the filming and lighting are great.I really wish that Allied had been a better film. It's not bad and it certainly is enjoyable to watch. I just feel that with small adjustments it could've been much, much better.",Allied

Allied falls right in the middle. An old fashion WWII drama and when I say old fashion I mean, musty, tired. Mr and Mrs Smith territory but with the major plus of Marion Cottillard. She is wonderful. Brad Pitt, who I love, looked like a special effect and being in a Robert Zemeckis movie I thought that he might be. Very strange. The simple premise of discovering that your spouse is not who you thought she was, opens a world of dramatic opportunities but there is something about Robert Zemeckis that makes me think he doesn't really care about the human interaction, no. he seems, always, much more focus in the special effects. Allies is no exception and in fact it has a couple of breathtaking visual coups. Unfortunately the actual drama left me completely cold.",Allied

Handsome star driven drivel that is over stylized in look and dialogue. While the impeccably dressed Brad Pitt takes on those lousy (and also quite well dressed) Nazis briefly in Casablanca to remind the audience who the bad guys were in WW Two, most of the film centers around the trite and jejune dilemma of ""true love"" between the handsome soldier and his mademoiselle. ""Allies' turns ""Casablanca"" on its tete, by truly making two people's Hill of Beans much more profound than the side show of the world going crazy when true Evil almost destroyed civilization. The movie reminds me a little of the English Patient"" without Any of the ""good stuff"" and all of the ""love conquers all"" self involvement. Plus Ralph Fiennes can act circles around Brad.

237,dcal2722,An absolutely ridiculous attempt at a WWII Epic,2,14 June 2017,"I will not even bother to comment on the story line which could have been a very interesting and well made film if only the script were very interesting and well made. In a ham handed attempt to bring the reality of 1940's society into 2016 by streamlining a lesbian couple into the story line as if it would have been a perfectly normal and accepted situation to have a woman, Pitt's characters sister, in uniform at his wedding pawing all over her lesbian submissive lover, this is while sitting at the same table as the ""V"" Section Commander who doesn't seem to care that a military officer is engaged in a lesbian sexual encounter while under his command in an intelligence unit which would have required people who had absolutely no ""weakness"" which could have possibly been compromised. Then later in the film where their roles seem to reverse and she is the one being manhandled by her cellist lover. My complete disillusionment with this film isn't related to the idea that a Lesbian Couple was written into the script, it's how they were written into the script as if they were no longer living their lives in secrecy for the most part, and certainly not in the open within the British Military in 1940's Britain; the very idea is complete nonsense and a complete insult to those who lived alternative lifestyles prior to the societal acceptance of these alternative lifestyles. These people within the LGBT movement had worked decades for acceptance. This idiotic script totally discounts the years and the struggles which were so hard fought by so many. I am not a member of the LGBT community but I can't help but feel incensed by the dismissal of the actual trials which those who were living a Gay lifestyle during WWII. Then there is the lengths which Pitts character goes to in total disregard of his orders and the lives of a number of men behind enemy lines to have people look at his wife's picture; it is simply one of the dumbest story lines I have ever seen played out within a major motion picture that didn't include the launch of space craft full of Well Drilling pros which then land on a Comet headed for New York, and then are successful!

It begins in Casablanca where the film delineates the life of two highly versed spies who appear to be an affectionate and effervescent couple but behind their masks are high professionals with dangerous skills. During their time in Casablanca as a 'fake' couple, construct a particularly complex plan to kill the German Ambassador. Through the success of their assassination they realise their love for one another is veridical and set off to London to pursue a life together. By building a life in London they now have a one year old daughter and a loving family. However, things drastically change when Max Vatan (Brad Pitt) is called to work only to be told intelligence proves that his beloved wife Marianne Beausejour (Marion Cottilard) is a 'counter-spy' working for the Germans. With this disturbing information the normal life they created start to escalate into insinuations and lies.I believe Allied provided audiences with a creative idea, excellent acting, unique characters and historic events. It encompassed everything those would look for in an setback drama.The film provided a concept that could have taken it into major success however the directing did not take it their. I understand if the creators of the film sought to ensure it was very dissimilar to 'Mr and Mrs Smith' but where was the action and the suspense I was craving.When they announced Marianne was a German spy I thought of the copious directions it would take the movie but they failed to deliver what the audience was suspecting and wanted.I advise those interested in watching the film to not be fooled by the trailers and sneak peaks but this is for the most part a drama film with very little action and suspense.My rating for Allied is: 6.5/10Thanks, Josh.",Allied
239,kstjam,Good movie if you're in the right mood,8,14 December 2016,"I went to see this movie after a particularly stressful week, looking for a distraction and entertainment. Wrong move. I left feeling more depressed than when I went in. Even other audience members were somber and silent as they walked out. It was a shocking twist at the end that brought out the waterworks and tissue boxes for the more prepared viewers.The movie was beautifully crafted, from the sets, to the locales and costumes. There are a couple of jarring goofs – the OTT swearing using 'F' word; the introduction of Max's sister whose openly lesbian relationship served no purpose in the film; the snorting of coke by a officer – is this the 40's or 70's? Also, I wasn't sure about the sandals Marianne wore in some of the scenes, which looked like she picked them up at her local mall, but overall everything looked true to the 1940's period.This is a wartime love story. Marianne, the beautiful female spy played by Marion Cotillard, is well portrayed – with wry smiles and more than a hint of mystery. She lies, manipulates and dispatches anyone standing in her way with cold efficiency; is she a double agent or not? Brad Pitt as Max, is her doomed French Canadian husband –doomed because of the relationship and the conflict between his love for his wife and the Allied cause. The romantic chemistry between the characters was lacking - despite Marianne's many sultry stares - but the tension that builds between them as the plot thickens, is palpable. The pace of the movie also quickens, drawing faster to a surprising, but sad conclusion.There are some light moments – the card trick shuffling, the playful banter on the roof- which serve to lighten and ground the film at the same time. The director does a good job of building the characters and balancing scenes which run the gamut of steamy, tense, suspenseful, action-filled and chaotic (eg. Marianne gives birth during an air raid).There are powerful emotions elicited at the end, a bit of overwrought melodrama that deliberately plays on the audience's reaction – but in the end, fitting, given the circumstances. You are left feeling the raw emotions of the main characters.8/10",Allied

This movie like so many others is full of implausible holes. This greatly reduces my personal enjoyment of the film because it irritates most of us that notice them. Just one example, by the time they had a big party where a Nazi Bomber just missed their house it would have been early 1944 or late 1943 the earliest, correct me if I'm wrong but i'm pretty sure that the Germans were starting to lose the war and were no longer bombing England with large formations of bombers, V Rockets perhaps yes. There are many other implausible things I could list but will keep this short. I don't care about tiny details that 99 percent of people wouldn't notice like this or that model machine gun wasn't used at that time, but the bombing of England 3 years after the Blitz ended? Really? I'm sure a lot of older people would have noticed especially the Brits.

Actually I think it's the first movie that I've seen that puts the Canadian side as protagonist. The photography is also very good. The shots that take place in the Moroccan desert, and in Morocco in a more general way, are precious. They have very refined aesthetics and a subtle symbolism. But the big problem of this movie is the chemistry between the two lead actors. Marion Cotillard and Brad Pitt may be great actors themselves but when both are together the chemistry just doesn't spark.

Didn't expect much as I read before going that it was a world war 2 romantic drama. But I was very surprised at the action, the espionage scenes. Moreover it was great fun to watch how they had recreated the early 20th century world war 2 environment, the costumes, the music and the get ups (especially Brad Pitt Man!!). The cinematography of the film was really good.I didn't seem to find any loop holes in the story and felt that the film was well directed and had a good story.It is a really good film for a one time watch.

The strory is catching and you would like to follow it through the end with an amazing mystery that will be solved near the end. The only thing that deduct from 10 score is slow pace at the first half of the film. Although it matched the theme of the film but can be faster.

259,pgmahone,Average film with nonsensical plot,4,15 November 2017,"As a fan of WW2 films I have to say this is the second time Mr Pitt has appeared in a period film with an idiotic plot SPOILERS SPOILERS SPOILERS So Brad goes to Morocco on a secret mission, he is apparently French Canadian but speaks like um Brad Pitt.He connects with a major french spy, an aging Ms Cottiliard, who he has no photo of and has never seen ( why? ) - and they proceed to murder the German ambassador in the most ridiculously planned operation of the war.Fast forward and he marries her and then a year later ( after many air raids that take place long after the BoB ??? ) they are living well when Brad is called to the office and told she is a spy for the Nazi's - well maybe, we'll know on Monday so take the weekend off but don't investigate this matter! Oh - by the way, if she is guilty YOU have to kill her yourself ( um - why? ) So shockingly Brad investigates the crap out of the matter and in doing so gets a fellow spy killed, blabs to his lesbian sister and eventually kills several Nazi spy's in London ( no need to try to turn them, to get them to feed false info to the boys in Berlin, maybe save a few thousand lives in Normandy - no sirree - Brad shoots em! ) Then he tries to escape with the wife but is stopped at the airfield, when she shoots herself and then FIN Utterly stupid",Allied
260,ilovedavii,Surprising,9,24 November 2016,"I had high hopes for this movie because of Robert Zemeckis, Brad Pitt, and Marion Cotillard. I definitely went into it prepared for a WWII movie, full of action and special effects. And to be clear, this movie certainly DOES have action and special effects (what Zemeckis film doesn't?), but it goes beyond that.The actions scenes, when they do happen, are well choreographed and fun to watch. They also earn the movie it's rating, and are brutal but not overbearing. Marion and Brad are both convincing, proving to the audience that they are well- trained spies who don't hesitate to kill.Something I found very interesting about this movie is that while it's not primarily a war film, it did provide a very interesting look at what life was like for people. This was a time when people partied like the world was ending. Drinks, drugs, sex, etc. But this was also a time when people sometimes watched planes get shot out of the sky. It's a fascinatingly personal way of portraying the war, and the people living through it.The special effects are stunning, Zemeckis seamlessly blending reality and effects. Many scenes are simply breathtaking. It's puzzling how the movie manages to be both classic and modern.As I mentioned though, this movie is more than just war and special effects. By the end, there are a few clear themes; putting what's best for those you love above your own needs, and trying your hardest to believe the best of/trust those closest to you. Even if it means you have to break some rules, or even put your own life on the line.The ending, which some say is overly-sentimental, hit a chord that worked for me. It showed the lengths people go to to protect their family. However people complain about the Forest Gump ending, and that one makes me cry almost every time I see it. So if I'm in the minority here, I'm not at all surprised.One last thing that I thought this movie did very well, was showing just how difficult it would truly be for spies to fall in love. For the first half of the movie, the two are basically brought together and drawn to each other because of their abilities. They live, supposedly, very similar lives. They are evenly matched. They fit together in every sense because of their mastery of espionage. And yet, once the twist comes along, that same mastery of espionage is what tears them apart. Marion's ability to lie, once a great asset, is now their greatest enemy. It's a wonderful way to weave the story together, and makes for some excellent tension as well as irony.Overall, Allied is absolutely a mix. It has espionage, it has war, it has assassinations, it has parties, it has family, it has romantic/steamy (quite steamy, might I add) moments, it has costumes and scenery, it has a mystery to be solved, etc. And some of these things it does magnificently. Some of these things it does just well-enough. But it does it all. Which is more than can be said for most movies these days.This movie certainly deserves the R rating. There is nudity, multiple sex scenes, a decent amount of violence, language, drugs.If you are a fan of classic movies, watch it. Is it perfect? No, it certainly has weak points and flaws. But overall I was thoroughly entertained by it. It kept me on the edge of my seat, and I will definitely be buying this on Blu-Ray, hopefully with lots of insight into how this film was made and what technologies Zemeckis used.",Allied

This film lacks the thrill for a thriller, the backgrounds for a war film and the depth for a drama. It is too thin a story that keeps floating on the surface. Even in a 'prelude' of a whole hour it fails to create engagement with the characters and even lacks to develop them. Brat Pitt in particular remains plastic in a failed attempt to 'under-act'. A slow-paced movie can be great. This one just did not deliver.The whole movie feels like the inside of a moviestudio. A few, too imposed, 'artistic' scenes do not raise the uninspiring cinematography.In my opinion a director does not always need to have the urge to elevate the public or make a profound statement in every movie... but, with that budget and talent...

272,niklas47302,Cheesy romantic thriller fun,5,20 July 2018,"Allied is set in the midst of WW2. It sees Brad Pitt and Marion Cotillard as secret agents in Casa Blanca, where they start their romantic adventure. They end up in London where it turns out that Marion is perhaps a double agent for the Germans.The entire film is shot with an absurd amount of filter and Hollywood esqu likeness. To further separate the audience, the script and dialogue do not allow any chemistry to be developed between the central characters. As this is integral in the start of any film, I could not engage fully.Nevertheless, in the second act it is learned that Marion is perhaps a double agent. Although rather predictable, from this point forward the pace is picked up and keeps you guessing until the end. This is its strongest point.Allied is supposedly loosely based on a true story, yet portrays scenes of an impossible and almost absurd nature. To exemplify this is a pregnancy that takes place in the middle of a war zone. There is also an extremely cheesy sex scene in a car while the camera is being spun and sand is thrown at the car windows. These scenes feel like they are forcing you to engage with the characters but just leave you laughing at the absurdity.

276,issa_haddar,Visually Stunning and very strong second half movie,8,26 November 2016,"Well, I had high expectations for this one. It is a movie that no matter how bad it might turn to be I just have to see it. The reason being is Brad Pitt and Marion Cotillard. The movie opens with a stunning shot of Pitt landing in a parachute in the Moroccan desert. And speaking of stunning shots, the movie overall is visually rich and very pleasant to watch; with Pitt's and Cotillard's amazing costumes, Robert Zemeckis delicate direction, and the beautiful sets in Morocco and London, the movie sets a nostalgic romantic mode and takes you back to the Golden age of cinema. As this was intentional by the director, you soon realize that he is trying too hard, at least in the first part of the film. The first half of the movie (before Pitt is informed that his wife might be a German spy) is packed with short scenes with Zemeckis trying to give you that 40s feel. The pace is odd with very short scenes just to move the story forward. There are plenty <1min scenes with beautiful framing and costumes that don't build up very well together, given the effort put in them. I mean there is this one scene that establishes the location and then moves to a well dressed Cotillard and Pitt having lunch and Cotillard says ""It is too Hot"" and that's it! And BTW expect to hear a lot of french in the first half. However, Cotillard keeps the first half engaging with her beauty and witty acting while Pitt speaks only when necessary and suddenly he asks her to marry him which, in my opinion, falls flat without proper build up like other incidents in the movie.The second half takes on a major turn, it was like putting on a new movie. We are now in London and year had passed. While the first half was Cotillard centered, the second revolved mainly around Pitt who delivered a stunning performance. He is informed that his wife is suspected to be a German spy. The background story provided about how Cotillard might be Spy is solid and not another cliché. The screenwriter deserve much credit here as the story is strong and doesn't leave any loose ends. This makes you stay at the edge of your seat during the second half of the film. Pitt denies the news about his wife (as any truth begins with denial). He then takes matters into his own hands trying to find the truth. For that he had to travel to France for a night to see a drunk man with one arm and on the way he fights some Nazis, this was a very nice small turn in the movie. Meanwhile, we are wondering just like Pitt whether is she a spy or not? The movie doesn't have a happy ending, but I loved how both characters were faced with very strong choices and had to take an action while still showing love to each other. Overall, the second half of the film makes up for the lows of the first half and makes Allied a solid WWII movie featuring two beautiful lead actors.",Allied

278,tanmayeshukla,A decent film marred by myriad subplots which provide little time for the good bits.,6,22 January 2017,"Is it a special trait of wars which never fails to accommodate love somewhere amid the politics and enmity or is it the intrinsic nature of love which manifests even in the most inconceivable of times. One can sense a bit of the old Hollywood classic Casablanca in Allied which goes beyond the mere trivial similarity however falls short to emulate the former's cinematic excellence.Set during the World War II, Max Vatan, an intelligence officer and Marianne Beausejour, a French resistance fighter are disguising as a couple in a special situation to assassinate a German Ambassador. They fall in love as they spend time together and realize that they have little time left as the chances of surviving the mission are minimal. As the mission gets over, it is then we realize there is much more to come and what follows hardly matches up to the level of the what is done with in a haste to reach the real plot. Max invariably asks Marianne to be her wife and move to Hampstead with him. They get married and settle in England where they have a child. Anna. After a merry year, the story then changes tracks as Marianne is suspected of being a German Spy and Max, stuck in love, is adamant and goes extreme lengths to prove otherwise.Brad Pitt as Max gives a restrained, stoic performance and such subdued roles usually fail to leave an impression and more less so when they are matched up with somewhat flat characters. Yet he is convincing as an Air Force Officer and besides he need not any intense drama because he is friggin' Brad Pitt. Marion Cotillard is the highlight of this movie. She is seductive when she talks, she is elegant when she walks, and she fights expertly and dresses voguishly. She alights the screen with her unbridled charm. Every time she is in the frame we are immediately drawn to the screen and she constantly elevates the otherwise low-key movie to one with action and purpose. The other actors have played their roles with sincerity which is one of Allied's strengths. The period backdrop has been brought to life with intricate designing of the mise-en- scene. The color tone is deep with high contrasts and shades are not overblown with care to retain the realistic feel to it. The frames are composed from an apparently fresh vision which highlights in addition to the aesthetics but reveals candid beauty in the mundane and often overlooked little details. Casablanca city is pictured with both its scorching desert as well as the soothing cool starry night sky over the terrace. The costumes are tailored beautifully which looks glamorous and classy on the big screen, particularly those wore by Marianne and the scene where she turns up all for the party in the chic outfit is a treat. The whole production works together and sumptuously achieves the singular vision, albeit the visual one, laid by the director celebrated for the same.There was little emotional investment between Max and Marianne to speak of. They hardly shared any intimacy with each other. This may well have been a deliberate decision to further ground the film with reality but there was nothing to compensate for the lack thereof, which is felt more in a film which was oozing with beauty and glorious cast. The result-one is not yet ready to share their sorrows when they haven't shared their 'moments'. The tone and tempo are also flat throughout the runtime which explains the missing 'edge' and surprise factor. Due to an underwhelming treatment, an interesting story which could potentially be an instant classic has been reduced to a bland film which struggles with itself-never sure what it is which is trying to tell. The hurried love-affair, the hurried end, Allied is at its heart a dramatic love story wrapped in the tension-torn of the World War II which rapidly shifts between an espionage thriller at the beginning to a love story for some time and then to a mystery about halfway which is told through jittery transition with limited character focus thus the denouement falls short to have the impact it was meant to inflict and the end comes off as melodramatic when it shouldn't have.Yet, it keeps one's attention throughout its runtime credit to its actors, Marion Cotillard in particular, visual brilliance and overall technical perfection. The director Robert Zemeckis has made a decent film obviated by the subplots which used up much of the space leaving little room to build the interesting bits which the audience most cared about, like the love story and Marianne's anxiety about her future. Granted the subplots add newer dimensions to a story, but in Allied, Steven Knight, the writer, appears to be treading too many paths at once so he takes a long jump towards the end which lead to the destination at the cost of skipping the necessary steps. People who are looking for a period film or a visual treat shouldn't miss this one but keep in mind that being technically good doesn't guarantee an overall rewarding film.",Allied

294,weereewa,World War 2 romantic spy melodrama,5,15 December 2016,"Allied (M) Set between Morocco in 1942 and the UK and France before D-Day, the core theme of ""Allied"" turns out to be German spies in Britain. They were all captured, tried in camera by civil or military courts with offences against the Treachery Act 1940and with one exception were hanged at either Wandsworth or Pentonville prison.Brad Pitt plays Canadian Wing-Commander Max, parachuted into Morocco in 1942 and driven into Casablanca to meet Marianne (Marion Cotillard). A few nights later in story time, maybe five minutes in film time, at a German Embassy reception they use sub-machine guns to assassinate the ambassador and his retinue. Back in England they marry, deliver daughter Anna in the hospital courtyard during an air raid and live happily on his Ministry of Defence salary.Spy-catcher chief (Simon McBurney) orders Max to answer a precisely-timed midnight phone call, write down the message and leave it where Marianne will see it. That's the opening gambit in a convoluted plot to confirm or deny whether Marianne is a German spy. If she is, Max is to use his service revolver to execute her. If he does not, he'll be hanged.British writer Steven Knight probably created that plot device to help director Robert Zemeckis glue film-goers to their seats. Seven decades later, we can allow Zemeckis some leeway in depicting military matters – light aircraft, weapons, uniforms, vehicles, etcetera. Few film-goers nowadays would know or care whether those are authentic. Many are not.But Knight's screenplay for what is otherwise an engaging-enough World War 2 melodrama has many small defects and one unforgivable one. The small defects mostly involve questionable motivation of characters or failure to acknowledge precedent explanations for later behaviour. The biggie is the spy-catcher's order to Max. It was illegal and un-necessary. I cannot imagine a high-ranking official being unaware of that. If she was under suspicion, British authorities would already have moved. That's how they were doing it in those days.I was appalled to see ""Allied"" basing its dramatic credentials on such an order. It may not worry film-goers enjoying an otherwise run-of-the-mill romantic actioner. Knight may simply have failed to do some easy research or, having done it, decided for unfathomable reasons to ignore the result. But either way, it left an enduring bad taste in my mouth.",Allied

This would NEVER happen in the 1940s as homosexuality was against the law and they were greatly disdained by the public. It is a completely pointless distraction from the period setting.

The acting was poor and unconvincing, especially from Brad Pitt. The film also had little creativity in casting. It also felt like the film simply applied the same stylising filter as from films such as The Theory of Everything.

302,Matthacho,"A nice romantic fable, but a preposterous spy thriller",5,3 March 2017,"Allied is a nice romantic fable, sweet and quite touching at times, about what two people caught in very extenuating circumstances might do in the name of love. However, the writer for this movie was so caught up in the artificial setup of the ""intimate betrayal rule"", the spy thriller part of the movie became preposterous at times, so much so that it detracted from the believability of the entire movie, and ultimately, it became hard to comprehend why the characters behaved as they did.The movie has been out for a while, so I hope it is okay to include some SPOILERS to make my point about how preposterous the setup for this movie is. If you don't want to know how the movie ends, then please stop reading right now.So, at the beginning, Marianne Beausejour (Marion Cotillard) pretends to be a French resistance fighter, but really a German spy planted there with the ultimate intent of winning the trust of the Allies and to infiltrate their spy organization. To do that she is going to help Max Vatan (Brad Pitt) kill off an expendable German dissident (Anton Blake). But the way they killed him off, I find it hard to believe that the German Abwehr, even in their most heartless and depraved state, would have allowed the killing of a score of innocent Germans in the process. All that the Abwehr had to do was let Herr Hobar (August Diehl) in on the plot and arrange a private meeting between the German Ambassador and Marianne and Max, just kill him nice and quietly, but I guess that would not have made for that exciting shootout scene at the party.With that mission accomplished and having not only earned the trust, but the love of Max Vatan, Marianne is now off to London to be his wife. Unbeknownst to her, the British SOE captures an Abwehr agent who spills the whole beans about her true identity, while at the same time, a lot of secret information that passes by her husband's desk ends up in some radio transmissions from her area of London. Wow, and then the SOE ""rat catcher"" (Simon McBurney) tells all this to Max and tells him how they are going to determine whether she is a spy or not. I am sorry, but the SOE in its most stupid and inebriated state would not tell this to the husband of a suspected spy, who himself would automatically be suspect. They would have just passed bogus information to him without him knowing to see if that information also turns up in the radio transmissions and try to catch them both. Tap their phones, bug their house, put them under 24-hour surveillance. Anything but the way they proceeded.At the end, Max finds out his wife is really not the real Marianne Beausejour because she can't play the piano. She makes a totally bogus excuse that other German spies threatened their daughter, Anna (Pearl and Luna Rumbelow). Preposterous! The only explanation possible is that she was a willing German spy up to that point, and that her love for the Nazis was greater than her love for Max or Anna, because if she really loved them both, all she had to do was to turn her handlers in to MI5 and could have even still kept her false identity of Marianne Beausejour. It turns out that Max was her stooge for 2 years. Ouch!The most preposterous moment of the movie came for me when Max's commanding officer, Frank (Jared Harris), tells Max that he ""blatantly disobeyed orders"", which resulted in another soldier being killed. In a time of war. At that moment, I thought, oh god, this movie is going to end with Max being court- martialed and being executed by firing squad. But instead, he retires to a horse farm in Canada. Totally preposterous! But then again, if it didn't end the way it did, this movie would not have been a nice romantic fable. Watch this for the romance. Overlook all the preposterous spy thriller setup.",Allied

308,notesfromthegate,Improbable and careless,6,23 November 2016,"The riff on Bogey's 'Casablanca' is superficial and half-baked, especially when the scene shifts to London. Leave aside the formulaic and implausible plot (e.g., a ridiculous scene where they kill a high-ranking Nazi and tons of other Nazis-- and then it's revealed that Hitler wanted him killed; but all Hitler had to do was use one Gestapo agent already in Casablanca and one bullet). Aside from that, it's the historic detail that's clumsy and anachronistic. Pitt's character is called ""Québécois"" but he's not from Quebec, he's from Ontario, an English Canadian, and the Cotillard character would have called him a 'petit Canadien'. Also, we're supposed to think that the Canadian army, with its battalion of Francophone fighters in England, have recruited an English Ontarian to pose as a native Parisian to go underground in French Morocco. Put your head around that one. Oh, we're told, he took French courses for 6 months-- that was probably enough. Only for a robot... Later, Brad poses (still undercover) as a native Parisian who claims to know no English -- despite his crazy English accent and stilted French, both of which could be fatal to him. Before that, he makes a language mistake, which the Cotillard character mis-characterises as ""Quebec French"" (the example is poorly chosen). However, there was no such thing as ""Quebec French"" during the war. From 1800 to the 1990s, it was called French-Canadian. Next, Brad has a dream of going to ""Medicine Hat,"" which in reality is a town in Alberta ('Quebec' and 'Medicine Hat' look like paid advertising placements). Brad wants to start a ""ranch"" in and among ""rolling green hills."" Medicine Hat is a mining and natural-gas city located in a dusty gulch in a desert. There are no ""rolling hills"" and even less ""green"" in the area, and very little ranching. At one point, Brad sees a German officer who is phoning the French secret police. Now the ""capital"" of fascist France was Vichy, a small city located about 700 km to the north across the Mediterranean. Nevertheless, the German picks up the phone and says ""Hello, is this Vichy?"" as if he had to call 700 km away to denounce a spy in Vichy-held Casablanca.

312,johnnyonlinne,It could've been great,5,2 March 2017,"(Warning, contains spoilers)The first part of this movie is excellent. Packed with well thought action, the plot evolves very naturally, and made me really interested on what was going to happen next. It is really good. By the second part, when they get back to London, and Max receives the news that his wife could be a Spy, I was like ""wow, interesting"". I didn't see that coming, and thought it was very original and could lead to a very good story. After the movie ended, though, I was pretty disappointed. It left me with a feeling of ""It could have been much better"". I believe that action could have been built much more, all the way up till the end of the movie. Since the plot was very interesting, action could build up till a ""grand finale"". But the second part was mostly very bland and redundant. During it, there was a lot of cliché moves from the director to stall the story as much as he could. Like every time Max got closer to a lead about his wife, some kind of ""coincidence"" or ""random"" action or thing happened to delay his investigation. For example, like when he went to ask the man in the wheelchair if he knew his wife in the picture. But ""coincidentally"" it happened that the man was blind. Or when he sent that rookie soldier to ask if the battlefield's officer knew his wife. The man was too drunk, couldn't answer the boy, and the rookie soldier died. Then he went to the local prison ask the man personally, and he started vomiting, saying nonsense things, delaying, delaying and delaying his investigation. These cliché moves from the director made watching the second part even a little irritating. It looks like he was out of ideas to make the movie's progression interesting and dynamic, as it was on the first part, so he had to resort to that to stall the story, so that the movie didn't end too fast. But it wouldn't have ended too fast, it just would have made the progression more dynamic and realistic, and then the story could had evolved in different ways. Like Max could have discovered sooner that his wife was indeed a German spy, but after knowing that she still loved him, they could had successfully flown to Switzerland, but the British government went after them, and they had to manage trying to escape them AND the German government as well, who also went after Marianne. You know? Something to keep the plot interesting, progressing and dynamic. I think the plot was very good had a lot of potential. By the end of the movie it indeed left me with a little bitter taste.

I wanted to bail at 30 minutes because it was not just slow, the plot was simply not moving. The movie could've started much later and you would not have missed much.The acting was quite bad. No chemistry whatsoever between the couple. Brad Pitt's French is beyond horrendous. People said that about his so called southern accent in Inglourious Basterds, but this is the first time I needed subtitles for French and I'm a French speaker. No, he does not sound like a Quebecer. Quebecers are not English speakers that speaker French horribly. They're native speakers who speak a dialect of French that does not exist in France anymore. They could've explained his accent in another way - that his mother was a French speaker, but she died when he was 10, so his French did not improve. Or that he was raised by a French family when he was a kid. Or any number of ways that one encounters in real life. Saying ""no, there's a place in Canada where everyone talks like that"" doesn't make any sense and I feel that it was added to get some bonus reference points from The English Patient.Cotilliard's English is, for some (not myself), a little hard to follow, but that's not a valid criticism. She plays a French woman. Making her fluent in English would not make sense.Casablanca. Again this was chosen as a nudge-nudge-wink-wink to some other film whose name I can't remember. But the film is not sure what it wants to be. It wants to be in Casablanca, which was a busy port city, but it also wants to be the English patient, with deserts and such. So it went down the middle - so there are random camel traders in the middle of a city, right in front of the German embassy. There are so many reasons why that's not likely (security perimeter, traffic, commandeering of animals/horses for the war effort, rationing, people eating the animals, etc), but the film doesn't care. If only there were resources or people that one could consult to make an accurate historical film. Something like photos or books or letters or footage or something. If only.The film has a misunderstanding of even the most basic things and passes off that misunderstanding as knowledge. Marianne tells Max (Brad Pitt) that after having sex, men would go to the roof to sleep. That was the custom, she said. But that's not a custom. People sleep on the roof (where it's cooler at night) because Morocco is a hot country and this was before the advent of air conditioning. If couples want to have sex, the roof does not give any privacy and public sex is indecent in the human kingdom. Even car sex gets you in trouble with the law in most countries. Imagine if she said ""this is a conservative country. We can't have sex on the roof"" - as opposed to...? Quebec? Paris? The UK? You can't have sex on the roof here either. Not even in 2017. Cops are such party poopers.This ""no sex on the roof"" thing is twisted and presented as some exotic custom. Moroccans and Germans are such prudes. The UK has lesbians openly living together in the 40's in front of military officers, while Moroccans and Germans make a big fuss over a little dogging on the roof.There's no point in going over every tiny thing, but this film was just one thing after another. Misunderstandings, anachronisms, stereotypes and clichés. From Moroccans to Brits, from Quebecers to Parisians, the film is filled with faults and errors.I would turn a blind eye to all of them if the movie was good, but it wasn't.

It seems that this addition was just another attempt to normalize homosexuality in the minds of viewers. In 1940s England lesbians were firmly in the closet and would NEVER kiss romantically in public. Nor would Londoners openly snort cocaine at a public party. Adding these details destroyed any feeling that you were experiencing life in the 1940s, thus destroying the credibility of the movie.

322,lyricmysledder,It's worth it,9,10 March 2018,"Movies are made for entertainment. Whether the movie is based on a true story or a fictional story, scenes are known to be exaggerated from the original fact. For the most part, movies are not meant to be informational, if you are looking for an informational film, you should be looking at documentaries, not movies. One of the most emotional and entertaining film I have ever watched has to be Allied.Allied is a movie based on the time period of world war 2 in the united kingdom. It jumps around from the opening scene in Casablanca where the main character meets another French operative. The movie follows a Canadian commanding officer deployed in the UK during world war 2. It follows the same guy through his time, during which he found the love of his life during a mission in Casablanca and started a family with a colleague who, along side him, fought together against the Nazis. But, all of his life in the UK, turned out to be a lie. The best and most memorable moment was when he finds out that the love of his life was actually a Nazis spy the whole time, working with other spies in their neighborhood. There was a scene just before this where the husband wanted to know if his wife is actually a spy so he went to France to ask a drunk about his wife. From this meeting, he found out that she played the French national anthem in front of German officers. Once he got back to the UK, he asked his wife to play that on the piano, to which she could not do. The moments immediately after that was absolutely breath taking. It gives a huge insight to how much they loved each other. When the wife was asked if she ever loved him, she replied, ""I loved you since Casablanca,"" fighting back tears of great sadness and guilt. The movie ended with him finding out the whole situation and helping his wife, who agreed to sell out who she is working with in order to stay with him and their daughter. At the very end, the allied forces finds out their agenda and started to chase after them, resulting with them almost escaping in a plane. But before they could escape, they were trapped by the allied forces, who were demanding for his wife to surrender. He, obviously loving her, wouldn't let her do it. But the only other option would be to either die or escape. Knowing their options, the wife decided to surrender so that her husband and her daughter could survive. It ended with her killing herself so that her husband won't be tried for treason.This movie really takes a toll on your emotions. It really brings you on a giant rollercoaster ride. If you didn't know how it would turn out, this movie really would leave a mark on you. From the incredible plot to the amazing acting, this movie really makes this story a wonder that has to be watched in order to be able to be enjoy it to the fullest. Just me telling you how it turned out does no justice for the masterpiece that it is. All i have to say is that it is a movie you must watch.Many of the reviews base their criticisms off of the fact that this film was not ""historically accurate"" but, i mean, it's a MOVIE, not a DOCUMENTARY where it has to historical accurate. Almost all of the bad reviews had a segment where they said something about how this one scene was not historically accurate or the absurdity of the time line of the movie. Also they also talk about how the logic of the movie in general doesn't make sense in comparison to reality. I mean like the movie didn't say that it would be nonfiction, and along with every other movie thats not a documentary, it usually is fiction. So all of their dumb criticisms just go down the drain due to the stupidity of their review in relation to the movie.Many movie critics just critiques on the smallest and most insignificant things, they never focus on the big pictures and all of the points where the movie was expetional in.",Allied
323,benharpwood,Fun romantic spy romp,7,15 February 2019,"This is one of those films that you approach expecting something different to what you get. The trailer and summary made me believe it would be a serious drama exploring love and loyalty in WWII, but The English Patient this ain't...This is more like a revisionist 21st Century reboot of Casablanca, and is old fashioned fun in a very similar vein.The comparisons between the two films are interesting and fun to note: this pair only pretend to have a history in Paris, but will 'always have Casablanca'; instead of a 1940s lame dame we have a 21st Century gun toting super spy; and instead of wartime sacrifice we get an ending where the fate of the lovers does amount to a hill of beans or five (very dishonourably!). It feels like, by riffing so obviously on the events in Casablanca, the film makers are inviting us to compare today's values with those of the 1940s.The script is excellent with some revelations handled superbly. The performances are strong enough. The sets and set pieces are beautiful. Okay there are anachronisms and inaccuracies but this isn't The English Patient, this is a sub-par Casablanca. And even a sub-par Casablanca is worth a watch.",Allied

325,terrylreisz-80228,Disappointed,3,20 November 2020,"Had no preconception and watched for the first time (Nov 2020). The story seemed to be written by Anna to smooth over her parents' shame/scandal. I was looking for confirmation when I landed here. Plot was slow and without a sense of danger in beginning and never picked up even when it was expected. Pitt, whom I usually enjoy, was lifeless, and there was no chemistry with Ms Cotillard who did fairly well otherwise. There were some good/believable fx, but the juggling of languages was difficult to hear. One tense scene was the enemy bomber that looked as though it would crash on top of their house.",Allied
326,downesmillroad,I really enjoyed this movie,8,6 January 2019,In spite of what others have said in reviewing this movie I really enjoyed it. It kept the suspense going as to whether she was good or bad going well. It was good easy watching and made for an enjoyable Saturday nights movie watch.,Allied
