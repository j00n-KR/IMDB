0,Leofwine_draca,A typically shallow teen movie with added witches,4,16 May 2016,"This predictable teen horror was made literally just before the genre became hot again with the success of SCREAM. While refreshingly free of clichéd scenes of a masked killer murdering blondes, the film does have the typical teen characters, like the jocks, the obnoxious bimbos, and the typical ""outsider"" girls who in this case happen to practise witchcraft. My biggest complaint with this film is the trivialising of witchcraft; the witches simply use it to cast a few love spells and cure a scar or two. It's not very grand or partially enthralling, which is (in my mind) how a witchcraft film should be. It's also not in the least bit scary.The film does try and at least there are a few interesting ideas to salvage it and make it a watchable, if forgettable, experience. The central idea about power and how it corrupts people is a good, solid one but here it is taken to laughable extremes - as initially friendly girl Fairuza Balk (who incidentally had an early experience with witchcraft, playing the Worst Witch in an '80s children's TV series) becomes a psychotic killer. Things come down to a battle between her and nice girl Robin Tunney (who also appeared in the much more entertaining END OF DAYS), here sporting a silly-looking blonde wig.Most of the other characters are either shallow or one-dimensional, including the two supporting actresses, Neve Campbell and Rachel True. Neither are given much material to work with and they seem to change from being evil to good and back when the script calls for it. Although it is nice to see the annoying Campbell back before she became famous. The acting is good enough, I suppose, but most of the characters are irritating and unlikeable, apart from good-as-gold Tunney who just doesn't ring true anyway. There's a sad lack of adult actors in what is an entirely teen-centred film, at least with SCREAM we have the saving grace of Henry Winkler in a supporting role. Skeet Ulrich is good value as always but he's not enough to make this a worthwhile experience.The special effects, including lots of creepy crawlies and some magic storms, etc. are fine enough but there's nothing outstanding that stays in the mind. The movie can hardly be called ""horror"" either seeing as the horror/gore content is extremely low, it's rather a teen movie which just happens to be about witches. THE CRAFT will probably appeal to teenagers but not a lot of other people - unless you like looking at pretty girls made up as goths and weirdos. Otherwise, it's an empty and shallow experience.",The Craft
1,SnoopyStyle,paint by numbers teen revenge drama,6,25 October 2013,"Sarah Bailey (Robin Tunney) is the new girl in the Catholic prep high school. She befriends a trio of outcast girls who dabble in witchcraft. Nancy Downs (Fairuza Balk) has troubled impoverished abusive home. Bonnie (Neve Campbell) has massive burns on her back. Rochelle (Rachel True) faces taunting from popular girl. When popular jock Chris Hooker (Skeet Ulrich) spreads rumors about Sarah, the girls cast a spell on him. This leads to more and more powerful spells as things spiral out of control.The girls are interesting. It's too bad the story is so mundane. It's strictly a paint by numbers teen revenge drama. It has no surprises. Other than putting hot girls in Catholic school uniforms, there isn't much to recommend from this film. Robin Tunney may not be the best to play Sarah. If I had the choice, I'd rather choose Neve Campbell. She can bring a lot more sweetness and innocence to the main role. That way the rumors would hurt more. The reluctance to play with witchcraft would be more pronounced.",The Craft
2,kosmasp,Witches be witches,8,7 March 2021,"I can see how some may feel this has not aged well. But the talent at hand here is really all the money as one saying goes. And it all starts so ... well I almost would have said innocently, but maybe that is not the right word. It begins slowly, it begins with things that seem nice to say the least. But even without anyone telling us, we know things can't be that easy - can they? Most certainly not.The movie goes on predictable, the effects may also not have aged well, but they are decent enough if you give this a break. The friendship of the females we have here feels more than real. The dialog is quite well written and the performances match that. The right women (playing girls, but nonetheless) for the right roles at the right time. Buffy was always quoted as an inspiration for Charmed, but I reckon this movie also had something to do with it. Lesson learned: Don't mess with a witch ... unless you are one yourself of course",The Craft
3,gavin6942,A Very 1990s Film That Is Both Horror and High School Drama,7,16 June 2010,"Three high school girls are dabbling in witchcraft, but their efforts are getting them nowhere. But then the new girl arrives, who seems to have a natural power. Together, they will walk the path of the witch, but some will take the safe route and others will walk towards the darkness. What will be unleashed, and will they be able to control it?Having been in high school in the 90s, I was quite aware of the Wiccan craze that was going around, especially among the girls. I don't recall if it came about before or after this film, but they definitely knew what they were doing in constructing the plot and characters. Apparently, Fairuza Balk was a devoted Wiccan and contributed to the authenticity -- I would love to know her thoughts on that now.Aside from Fairuza Balk, we can look back and see the early careers of Neve Campbell and Robin Tunney... even Christine Taylor, the future wife of Ben Stiller. I had no idea at the time they would blossom into big stars. That, and the soundtrack was rather popular, as well.Some have compared this film to ""Carrie"", which I think is a great injustice. Yes, the film is a story of girls coming of age (despite being written and directed by men) and having magical abilities. But it's not much more similar than that. Carrie is an outcast and scared, while the girls here are powerful and puberty really is not a crucial part of the story at all.I think this film deserves a resurgence: a fine story, good acting and impressive effects for the time. I would recommend it to anyone, and especially if you were a teenager in the 1990s. You may find the themes familiar: it's like ""Clueless"" for those of us who weren't quite so glamorous.",The Craft
4,jboothmillard,The Craft,6,12 July 2005,"I saw The Craft years ago, during my time in college, I could only remember it for two of the cast members, some of its concept, apart from that, I knew I had to watch again when I saw the trailer for a follow-up. Basically, Sarah Bailey (Robin Tunney) is a troubled teenager with a painful past, suicidal tendencies and hallucinations has moved from San Francisco to Los Angeles with her father (Cliff De Young) and stepmother. She enrols in a local Catholic high school, but has trouble fitting in. At the school, there are three girls considered outcasts, Nancy Downs (Fairuza Balk), Bonnie Harper (Neve Campbell) and Rochelle Zimmerman (Rachel True), they are witches. They are looking for another girl to join them and become a coven; they find that in Sarah, when observing that she hides unusual abilities. Sarah is convinced to join them after they reveal they also have troubles. Nancy is considered promiscuous, her family live in a trailer and her stepfather is abusive; Bonnie's body is covered in burn scars following a car accident, and Rochelle being black is subjected to racist bullying from a group of popular white girls. They are thrilled by their connection, all worshiping a powerful deity they call ""Manon"", and they often visit occult shop owner Lirio (Assumpta Serna) for spell books. One night, while with the girls, Sarah is harassed by a homeless man (Arthur Senzy) with a snake, he is hit by a car and the girls believe that together they willed it to happen. Sarah goes on a date with the popular Chris Hooker (Skeet Ulrich), who she is attracted to, but she is upset when the next day he spreads a false rumour that they had sex. When Sarah confronts him, he treats her disrespectfully in front of his friends. Sarah responds by casting a spell on Chris. In turn, Rochelle casts a revenge spell on racist bully Laura Lizzie (Christine Taylor), Bonnie casts a spell for beauty, and Nancy one for power. The girls soon find that their spells have been successful. Chris becomes infatuated with Sarah, Bonnie's scars on her back miraculously heal, and bully Laura begins to lose her hair. Nancy causes her stepfather to have a heart attack and die, after which she and her mother Grace (Helen Shaver) receive his life insurance policy and move into a luxurious high-rise apartment. Nancy becomes greedy for power and encourages the others to join her in a rite called ""Invocation of the Spirit"". On completion of the spell, she is struck by lightning. The following day, the other girls see Nancy walking on water, and the beach is littered with sharks and other dead animals. Nancy also starts to lack empathy and takes risks with her life and those of others. The spells that the girls have cast soon lead to negative consequences: Bonnie becomes aggressively narcissistic, Rochelle finds Laura traumatised and hysterical because of her baldness, and Chris has become obsessed with Sarah, she rejects his advances and he attempts to rape her. At a party, in supposed retaliation, Nancy uses a spell to transform herself into Sarah and fool Chris into having sex with her. The real Sarah interrupts, it is obvious Nancy has unrequited feelings for Chris. He is upset at being fooled and says that Nancy must be jealous, she is angered and uses her power to throw Chris out of a window, killing him. Sarah tries to cast a spell to prevent Nancy from doing more harm, but it doesn't work, and the coven turns on Sarah. They invade her dreams, torment her with visions of swarms of snakes, rats, and insects, and make her believe that her family has died in a plane crash. They try to cause her to commit suicide, and Nancy cuts Sarah's wrists herself. Sarah is initially terrified but fights back by ""invoking the spirit"". She heals herself and scares Bonnie and Rochelle using a mirror, Bonnie sees herself with facial scars and Rochelle sees herself losing her hair, they run in terror. Finally, Sarah uses a binding spell to defeat Nancy and prevent her from causing harm forever. Sometime later, Bonnie and Rochelle are now powerless, as Manon took away their powers for abusing them. They visit Sarah attempting to reconcile with her, but she wants nothing do with them. Bonnie and Rochelle scornfully mutter that Sarah must have lost her powers too, but she causes a tree branch to nearly fall on them, and she warns them away. Meanwhile, Nancy has been committed to a psychiatric hospital, stripped of her powers, and strapped to her bed, screaming that she believes she can fly. Also starring Breckin Meyer as Mitt, and Nathaniel Marston as Trey. The four beautiful young leads all do well, Balk being the feisty goth, Tunney as the new girl, and Campbell and True as the other coven members. The story of a group of teenage witches works well, the spell casting and dark moments are mixed but eye-catching, a glossy and worthwhile teen supernatural horror. Good!",The Craft
5,Tweekums,Teenage witches in Southern California,7,1 January 2017,"When seventeen year old Sarah Bailey moves to a new school in Los Angeles she initially has no friends but quickly gets close to three other girls; Nancy, Bonnie and Rochelle. These three are very much outsiders at school and see themselves as witches; one of them sees Sarah as the potential fourth member who will make their magic work. They each cast a spell; Sarah wants the boy who hurt her feelings to love her; Rochelle wants revenge on the girl who racially abused her, Bonnie wants her scars to disappear and Nancy, the de facto leader of the group, wants the power of 'Manon' the deity they worship. Their spells soon take effect and not long after that it becomes apparent that they haven't quite gone according to plan; the boy Sarah wanted to love her becomes dangerously obsessive and the other girls enjoy their power a little too much. Sarah believes they must stop their activities but the others, particularly Nancy, are determined to carry on and turn against Sarah.This is an enjoyably teen film with a supernatural twist. The magical elements are built up gradually but it is safe to say few viewers won't be surprised when things turn bad and people start to die. There aren't many really scary moments, unless you have a problem with the sight of snakes, bugs and rats. The cast do a solid job; Robin Tunney is good in the role of Sarah and Neve Campbell and Rachel True impress as Bonnie and Rochelle however it is Fairuza Balk who stands out as the increasingly insane Nancy; she makes her character feel genuinely dangerous. The film doesn't over-rely on special effects and those that there are are pretty good. The story is well told and fun to watch; there is a little bit of swearing and some mildly scary moments but overall I'd think this can be enjoyed by most teenage (and older) viewers. Overall a fun film that fans of the genre should enjoy; just don't expect anything very scary.",The Craft
6,BA_Harrison,Witchy nonsense for teenagers.,5,19 November 2006,"Three teenage girls, Nancy (Fairuza Balk), Bonnie (Neve Campbell) and Rochelle (Rachel True), practice witchcraft in their spare time, but only achieve real success when a fourth girl, Sarah Bailey (Robin Tunney), joins the group. It is not long before the members of the coven begin to abuse the powers they have unleashed, whilst hurting others in the process. Sarah decides enough is enough and wishes to leave the group, but the other girls have different ideas...The first half of the film is obviously designed to appeal to social misfits and goths, and deals with the main characters' use of magic to improve their lives. We see Sarah dealing with a jerk who spread rumours about her, Bonnie cured of her awful scarring, Rochelle getting revenge on a bully, and Nancy and her mum inheriting a fortune.The second half sees things turning sour, as the teen-witches lose control. Nancy becomes power mad and eventually uses her magic to kill.Aimed squarely at a teenage audience (particularly females), The Craft is a rather weak tale of witchcraft which even its talented young cast cannot save from mediocrity. I found the film to be fairly tedious, even at a reasonably tight 97 minutes running time (although I perked up a bit when Neve Campbell entered the classroom in a tight white top!).Angst ridden girls who like to think they're 'different' will definitely lap this stuff up, seeing the leads as kindred spirits, but pretty much anyone else will recognise this for the calculated Hollywood claptrap that it is.",The Craft
7,moonspinner55,"Lots of charisma, but a script with no smarts...",5,21 July 2001,"Fairuza Balk--as the leader of a group of teen witches--is such a commanding presence, it makes no sense for the filmmakers to try and pass her off as a high school misfit. She would have the kids at her beck and call, whether they liked it or not. Alas, her character is given supernatural powers and naturally she goes over-the-edge. I wanted to see this movie go in a different direction: watching this girl overcome her odds WITHOUT the witch-y powers. This is a formula thriller with no interest in character content or a plot that makes any sense. Its aim is to introduce several characters and quickly have them turn on each other, thus setting the stage for a special effects-induced showdown. Rather a waste, especially since the cast is so strong and the technical aspects so gripping. You come away from ""The Craft"" without much to chew on, except what went wrong and what possibilities were missed. ** from ****",The Craft
8,BandSAboutMovies,Has surely held up!,8,19 December 2019,"You know, I love the movies Ideal Home and Bad Dreams. I'd never guess that they were both written and directed by the same person, Andrew Fleming. You may not know the man, but chances are you know his 1996 film, The Craft.Producer Douglas Wick (he produced Stuart Little and also co-wrote the sequels) wanted to create a movie that mixed the high school experience with witchcraft, which he worked on with screenwriter Peter Filardi (Flatliners). Well, he sure did it. This is a movie that was a quiet hit but has never gone away. Take it from someone who has dated plenty of goth girls.Sarah Bailey (Robin Tunney, wearing a wig as she had shaved her head for Empire Records) is the new girl in town, having moved from Los Angeles to San Francisco with her father (Cliff DeYoung, Shock Treatment) and stepmother. She soon becomes friends with a group of outcasts who are rumored to be witches: the scarred Bonnie (Neve Campbell), trailer trash and totally awesome Nancy (the legit Wiccan Fairuza Balk, who was also in Return to Oz) and Rochelle (Rachel True, CB4), whose black skin in a nearly all white school makes her a target of ridicule. The witch rumor? Yeah, it's true. They all worship an entity they refer to as Manon.Sarah becomes attracted to the popular Chris Hooker (Skeet Ulrich, who was very much a thing in 1996), but he claims that they slept together and ruins her reputation before it gets started. That leads to the girls finally completing a big spell that gives them everything they want: Chris falls in love so hard that he can't live without Sarah, racist bully Laura Lizzie (Christine Taylor) loses her hair and popularity, Bonnie becomes gorgeous and Nancy's abusive stepfather dies and she gets rich.However, it's not enough. After a rite called the ""Invocation of the Spirit,"" Nancy gains even more power because, you know, she got hit by lightning (actual Wiccan Pat Devin was the on-set advisor, so maybe this really does occur). Now she can't be stopped and all of the girls other than Sarah have gone wrong. The coven turns on her, but Sarah ends up stronger than all of them.Of course, Blumhouse is remaking this, with Zoe Lister-Jones directing. There was talk of another remake and a direct to video sequel which never happened. I had hoped that that luck would have stopped this new version, but it's already finished production.I learned a really important lesson from The Craft. The girl I was dating at the time asked me which member of the coven I found most attractive. I said none of them. She kept pressing and begging for my answer. Of course Fairuza Balk is the right answer, but I kept quiet until finally, after an entire meal of her asking, I told her. She instantly grew angry and said, ""The right answer is none of them!"" Somewhere inside this story is a lesson.I love the scene where all the fish wash up and the coven realizes how much power they have. You don't know how many times the women in my life have made me watch this movie. I have grown smarter and not said a single thing about Nancy.",The Craft
9,preppy-3,Scary and well done horror movie,8,19 February 2010,"Sarah (Rachel Tunney) a new girl in a high school falls in with a bunch of misfits--Nancy (Fairuza Balk), Bonnie (Neve Campbell) and Rochelle (Rachel True). It turns out they all have magical powers and use them for themselves. It starts out as fun and games for the girls--but the spells they use get out of hand and they begin to feel their power. Also Nancy starts going crazy slowly and things barrel out of control.Nobody thought this would be a hit when it came out. The studio thought it would die and it was given a totally unnecessary R rating...but it was a big hit. Let's get the rating thing out of the way first. There's no nudity, no sex, very little blood, no gore and only a few minor instances of swearing. So why the R rating? It was shot for a PG-13 and should have gotten it.That aside this is a very good movie. The script is well-written and the four main actresses are very good. Even better the special effects showing the girls using their power are used sparingly at first. They're all done quietly with no sudden noises or blaring music. It makes them all the more creepier when you see them. At the end when there's the big battle between good and evil the special effects REALLY get going and it's all the more surprising because they were used so quietly before. As said before all the acting is good...except for Skeet Ulrich as Chris. He's wooden (his face NEVER changes expression) and he was so annoying I could have cared less for him. He's the only misstep here. This a creepy, scary and fun horror movie that well worth a look. Ignore the stupid R rating. I give it an 8.",The Craft
10,poolandrews,Average teen drama/horror.,5,22 May 2007,"The Craft starts as Sarah Bailey (Robin Tunney) & her dad (Cliff De Young) move into their new house in Los Angeles after moving from San Francisco. While at her new school Sarah befriends three outcasts who claim to be witches, Nancy (Fairuza Balk), Bonnie (Neve Campbell) & Rochelle (Rachel True) who together practise witchcraft. Sarah is a real witch & the spells they cast start to become reality, at first things are great as things appear to be going right for them all for once & Nancy conducts a spell call the Summoning of the Spirit which turns her into some crazed evil witch. Sarah decides things have gone too far & tries to stop Nancy...Co-written & directed by Andrew Fleming I thought The Craft was an average supernatural teen film at best. The script by Fleming & Peter Filardi takes itself extremely seriously & just isn't that good. For a start I would barely categorise The Craft as a horror film if not for an over-the-top special effects driven climax, for the most part it felt like a teen drama with various outcasts gaining strength from each other's friendship. Then it turns into a feel good Disney type film as the magical powers the friends have improves their lives beyond recognition in positive ways & then for no apparent reason Nancy suddenly becomes evil at which point Sarah has to stop her. I didn't like any of the four central character's, I thought they were very unlikeable. The dialogue was flat, bland & totally forgettable. If there are books freely available to buy from a shop which can give you powers such as those seen in The Craft why hasn't everyone got one? What was the thing with the guy & the snake all about at the start as well? The more I think about The Craft the more I dislike it actually. It's watchable if your bored & there's nothing else on telly but I didn't think it was anything special or particularly good.Director Fleming does alright & the film looks pretty good with a nice subdued colour scheme especially at the end. There's not much horror here, there's no tension or excitement & a lack of atmosphere. There are plenty of snakes & bugs at the end though so if you find creepy crawlies scary then this isn't the film for you.With a supposed budget of about $15,000,000 The Craft is well made with high production values & has that Hollywood polish to it. The casting here is very wrong, Balk, Tunney & Campbell were all over the age of 20 while True was 30! They never come across as high school teenagers that's for sure although they are easy on the eye & Balk looks good in goth clothing.The Craft is an OK time waster, it tells a story I suppose but it's nothing outstanding or particularly memorable. Not brilliant but not totally worthless.",The Craft
11,lastliberal,"Watch out for the weirdos, girls.",6,26 January 2008,"This was a really interesting and funny movie about teens and their problems exploded to the nth degree by black magic.Fairuza Balk (Almost Famous, American History X) is a goth dream as she goes over to the dark side. She steals the show and I was almost sorry to see her end up like she did. BWa ha ha!Neve Campbell (Wild Things, Scream 1,2,3) is always worth watching and ""Hot"" is just not good enough to describe her.First time I have seen Rachel True. She was really good, and hot, too.But, it was Robin Tunney (Hollywoodland, The Zodiac) as Sarah that surprised them all!You have to watch those Catholic Schoolgirls. They are sometimes real witches!",The Craft
12,Calicodreamin,Mediocre,5,19 February 2020,"Overall I was a little underwhelmed by the craft.

Not a bad movie... but not great either.",The Craft
13,TBJCSKCNRRQTreviews,Pretty good teen-horror-comedy about witchcraft,7,8 August 2004,"I haven't seen too many films about witchcraft(technically, this is the only one, since Charmed is a series), but I do think that this is pretty good, and probably one of the better, films about the subject. It's about a teenage girl, who moves to a new town, and is made an outcast almost the moment she sets foot in the new high school. She quickly meets three other girls who are outcasts, and who are very much into witchcraft and magic. They need her as a fourth witch, and the moment she joins, they start attempting magic. But not long after, something goes wrong, and the magic seems to take over. The film has a great cast, all four leads are great, the supporting characters are also well-cast and well-acted. In my opinion, Fairuza Balk is great in the lead villain type role. Robin Dunne and Neve Campbell are great in their respective roles. The film has a multitude of teen stars, and it benefits from the many talents. Breckin Meyer, Skeet Ulrich, and several more whose names I can't remember for the life of me right now. The horror portions of the film are pretty well-done, with great shocks and scares, and pretty good atmosphere. The special effects are mostly well-done, except for some of the CGI, which looks horribly dated now, 8 years later. The soundtrack is good, most of the songs fit well with the scenes they accompany. The plot is very good, interesting and involving. It also manages to put in a shade of drama into the film, which further helps the film become interesting. The acting is all good, with a few of the performances being great. The characters are all well-written and credible, and most of them are interesting. The film isn't very cliched, though it may be derivative of other films of the genre; like I said, I haven't seen any other movies about witchcraft, so I don't know for sure. The comedy parts of the film are also well-done, and really lift an otherwise fairly dark and somewhat mildly depressing film to a more enjoyable level. The humor is very well-integrated, it never feels out of place. The film, much like Charmed, offers the witchcraft theme a good balance between respect for the subject and humor, having fun with witchcraft(granted, it's more about the witchcraft than the humor, but it works well, I think). All in all, a pretty good horror-comedy, with some solid lead characters and a thoroughly entertaining film experience. I recommend it to fans of teen-horror, teen-comedy, and mixes of the two genres. Fans of the various teen-actors in the film might also enjoy it. 7/10",The Craft
14,AlsExGal,Absolute power corrupts absolutely,6,11 March 2019,"This film is nothing really special, and it telegraphs what is going to happen from miles away. The story is about four teen girls in a Catholic high school who are outcasts for different reasons - one lives in poverty with a semi-abusive stepfather, another has a scarred arm and back, another is the victim of boiler plate racism, and the fourth - well, I could never really figure out her problem other than she was the new girl in school.They are all beautiful, but all are bullied by girls and gals who - IMHO - weren't as good looking as they were. So they dabble in witchcraft to get out of their bad situations. Only two actually wish bad things to happen to their tormentors. The other two just want their bad circumstances to be gone, and in one situation that results in unexpected and unwished for death. But, absolute power corrupts absolutely, and soon the leader of our gang of four is drunk with power.Am I a bad person because I liked seeing the cool guy make a fool of himself in front of his friends over the girl he trash talked? Well, so be it. The film is mainly good for its special effects and for a look back at the teen stars of the 90s. Fairuza Balk is very good at playing a very bad girl. She has the exotic yet scary facial features for the role, but she couldn't have done anything with it without talent.",The Craft
15,kannibalcorpsegrinder,"Rather uninspired, but still entertaining witchcraft affair",5,15 May 2015,"Arriving at a new school, a teen meets up with a group of social outcasts who offer her entrance into their coven of witches, and after they grow stronger the power-mad coven are soon inciting retribution against their classmates as she tries to put an end to their reign of terror.There isn't much to the film. One of its' better features is the fact that this follows a lot of the real witch's spells and ceremonies which gives it a touch of realism as the chanting and special spells are quite realistic that allows for a touch of believability for many of those scenes. The many different spells, both good and evil are what really keep the film afloat since they start harmless and soon start affecting others. From the simple and harmless ramifications of their easier spells to the later ones that actually focus on supernatural powers are all fun to witness and believably done. The big action scene here, the final confrontation with the coven-members inside a large mansion, is quite entertaining and does offer up some big excitement along with the extraordinarily creepy sequence where almost everything in the house is covered with thousands of snakes or insects that must be crossed before heading to the final destination, is creepy, ingenious and really comes the closest to out-and-out horror. Otherwise, that's all that pretty much all that work for the film as there really isn't a whole lot to it. The only real flaw the film has is that it's really hard to feel threatened by the witches. Most of the spells are pretty much nonthreatening to others, and by removing the fact that they never really harm anyone physically, even at the end, it's really hard to feel fear of them. As the spells themselves aren't dangerous or evil, even the really dangerous ones that are performed do nothing harmful to others even when they're trying, and it makes it really hard to feel threatened by these. That becomes even worse since it spends all it's time on them, and therefore the opportunities are never there to feel that there's much to be feared of in here as simple avoidance makes for a more satisfying hindrance to their plans. It makes it really hard to supposedly be scared of witches seeking revenge when the most dangerous thing that they do is cause a person's hair to fall out. It's a big problem, and the main one in the film.Rated R: Graphic Language, Violence and attempted Rape.",The Craft
16,trashgang,from student flick to revenge to horror,8,29 July 2020,"This is still a classic to watch. It's made in the year that horror was reborn, 1996 (Scream) and that was the reason so many adolescents went to watch it and be honest, the acting is top notch.I watched it back then and just did with my youngest daughter. She wa okay after seen it, she liked it. And she said, there are sentences that rae used on TikTok coming out of this cult classic.Starts off as a normal flick that turns into a real horror. The effects are a bit outdated here and there but still, there are a few jumpscenes. But it came notorious due the fact it had Neve Campbell in it just before Scream made her great and the perfect casting of the 4 witches and the performance of Fairuza Balk.It was so popular that it even was copied the same year by Little Witches but failed completely.It's so nice to see it nowadays, what an excellent flick and funny to see Skeet Ulrich (Riverdale) in his younger years.It's out there on Netflix so watch it with th efamily, you won't regret it.

17,JamesHitchcock,No More than a Trivial Film about Bitchy Schoolgirls,5,24 May 2006,"Contrary to what one reviewer assumes, Hollywood does not generally attack witchcraft or treat it as being necessarily evil. To do so would be to do the subject an honour it does not deserve, the honour of being treated as a genuine phenomenon. There are, to be sure, a small minority of Wiccans- well represented on this board- who genuinely believe that they can cast spells and an equally small minority of fundamentalist Christians who genuinely believe that there exist witches who possess malign powers given to them by Satan. For the great majority of people, however, at least in the West, belief in witchcraft is equated with ignorant and irrational superstition, and Hollywood has long since learnt that it is not good box-office to make serious films about things your audience refuses to take seriously.What Hollywood does is to use witchcraft in two ways. One is for purely humorous purposes, as in the television comedy ""Bewitched"". The other is to use it as a metaphor for the human condition. The witch or wizard is not a god or a devil, but a human being who happens to have extraordinary powers. He or she is also a moral being, aware of the difference between good and evil and with the responsibility to distinguish between them when making use of his or her powers. The ""Harry Potter"" films are a good example of this. Harry's magical powers may be pure fantasy (and the films never try to persuade us that they are anything else), but the moral choices which face him are the same as those which face people in the real world. The audience need to suspend their disbelief in witchcraft, but not their belief in right and wrong.""The Craft"" has the ambition to be another film of this type. Like the Potter films it is set in a school, but this is an everyday Los Angeles school rather than a British public school specialising in the magical arts. The film centres on a clique of three girls, Nancy, Bonnie and Rochelle who are regarded as strange and eccentric by their classmates because of their obsession with witchcraft. All three are outsiders. Nancy, the leader of the clique, is from a poor, ""trailer-trash"" family, looked down upon by her more middle-class schoolfellows. Bonnie is convinced she is physically unattractive because of scars on her body. Rochelle is the only black girl in the class, and the victim of racist taunts from the class bitch Laura. (Laura- like Cordelia in ""Buffy the Vampire Slayer""- is an example of that over-used stock figure in American high school dramas, the ""most popular girl"" who manages to retain her popularity despite being obviously unpleasant; I suspect that in real life a girl who went around making comments like ""I don't like negroids"" would be shunned by her classmates, not voted Miss Popularity).A fourth girl, Sarah, is welcomed into the little clique. Sarah is herself an outsider, being a new girl at the school after her father has moved from San Francisco to Los Angeles. The girls discover that they do indeed have magical powers, and begin to use these powers to their advantage. Bonnie's scars disappear from her body; the handsome boy whom Sarah has set her heart on begins to fall in love with her. Gradually, however, the tone of the film darkens as the coven start to use their powers in a vindictive way; for example, Rochelle makes Laura's hair fall out. Sarah becomes worried by these developments and tries to use her powers to prevent Nancy, who is becoming seriously unbalanced, from harming others, but without success. The film darkens still further as Nancy uses witchcraft to kill those who have offended her, including her abusive stepfather. Sarah, frightened, tries to break free from the coven, only to find the others pursuing her.The film never succeeds in the way the Potter films do. This is partly because of the acting; apart from Fairuza Balk's Nancy, a memorably scary creation with her Goth make-up and spiky hair, all of the witches, especially Robin Tunney's Sarah, seem rather colourless. The main reason, however, why the film does not succeed is that it lacks the imagination that distinguishes all great fantasy films. J.K. Rowling's books (like those of Tolkien) are so successful because they conjure up a whole new world of the imagination, a world which is both like our world and different, a world populated both by strange creatures and by seemingly ordinary mortals like Harry himself, and the films are able to translate this world into cinematic terms. ""The Craft"", by contrast, lacks this visual imagination. It is never able to transport us into another world, but remains firmly stuck in the real world of a banal American high school, which just happens to be a high school where four girls have magical powers. Unlike the Potter films and the ""Lord of the Rings"" trilogy, which use the language of fantasy to make serious points about good and evil and human nature, ""The Craft"" remains an essentially trivial film, where supernatural special effects are simply used to liven up what is no more than a story about bitchy schoolgirls being nasty to each other. 5/10.",The Craft
18,Smells_Like_Cheese,"If you want a good cat fight, watch it",8,15 November 2003,"It's not a scary movie, it's like a weird version of ""Clueless"". It brings me back to when I was in grade school and wanted to be apart of high school. And I always wondered if this was like what my future would hold meeting new people. Witches? The plot is kinda basic ""Evil Dawson's Creek"". :D Sarah is the new girl in town who is trying to fit in with very rude and snobby people at her new school. You can tell from the beginning that there is something very special about her. There are three girls, Nancy, who is the white trash scary goth girl, Bonnie who has severe burn marks all over her back, and Rachelle who is constantly picked on by a racist school girl, they notice Saraa and they happen to be witches who need a forth in their group, guess who that is? Sarah! She is also noticed by the high school jock jerk who uses girls and treats them like whores. She is first frightened by the girls, mostly Nancy, and leaves. She goes to see Chris, but when she refuses a private invite to his house, he spreads a nasty rumor around school about her night with him. She goes back to the girls and they discover how much more powerful they are with Sarah. They perform simple spells at first: flying, love spells, changing appearances. But things get more intense and serious: Bonnie's scars ""magically"" disappear and becomes gorgeous, but snobby. Rachelle's racist bully looses her hair, which seems cool, but is eventually very cruel and immature. Nancy has her step father ""killed"" in some way of a stroke, and inherits $175,000. She also goes as deep as to invoke the spirit of their beliefs of Manoe and becomes crazy. Sarah's love spell on Chris was to only get him to like her and apologize, but it turns on her very badly when he becomes too obsessed with her. Sarah knows that things are bad and decides not to participate her magics with the group and they turn on her, badly. To the point of threatening her life.It's a strange movie, it's entertaining to watch and the acting is pretty decent. You really get into the movie. I'm not sure if you could call it scary. But like the critics said ""It's Carrie meets Clueless"". It's a fun teen movie. So if you liked those movies, you might like this. 8/10",The Craft

22,A_Different_Drummer,"Massively Under-rated, watch two actors at their peak...",10,18 November 2013,"The strangest phenomena in film today (and I have seen a couple) are films which, when you see them, you think they are merely ""OK"" but on second viewing they get better, third viewing even better, and so on. (FORBIDDEN KINGDOM comes to mind, seen it about 8 times, but there are dozens like this). This has something to do with human nature, I suspect, an innate desire to criticize even where criticism is not called for. I believe this film falls into this category. Every now and then I watch it again, and each time I find less to dislike, and each time I fall a little deeper under the director's spell. But that is the key to this film, aside from camera angles and lighting, the story just builds and builds, the suspense just builds and builds, and not only is the ending pitch-perfect, but even the second ending or anti-climax is fun as well. I have seen a lot of these kinds of films but very few that I can make these claims about. I saw the film again just prior to writing this review and even though I knew what was coming I disappeared into the story. Another odd factoid is that, for whatever reason, this film may have captured Neve Campbell and Robin Tunney at the peak of their craft (sorry for the pun). Tunney's charismatic sweetness works best when it plays off against something darker and Campbell has never been scarier in her career. She never gets to the point of eating the furniture -- which would be overdoing it -- yet you the viewer cannot help but believe her when, depending on the point in the film you are at, she alternatively threatens to kill you, and then asks forgiveness for that same threat. I believe time will be kinder to this film than the current IMDb rating.",The Craft

However this film wasn't exciting as I would hoped! It just didn't really give me what I wanted like the story slipped straight away when Sarah left the group and the other three girls became such physios into killing her. I mean woah woah woah, what in the world is freaking going on here? This isn't what should happen for god sake, what were they thinking of just messing up the story?

24,CuriosityKilledShawn,The Daft.,6,15 April 2012,"Teen angst movies are rarely realistic, and more rarely cast actual teenagers. A gaggle of twenty-somethings working through their collective angst with witchcraft is about as far-fetched as you can get. I'd willing to accept all of this if the film were clever or atmospheric, but it achieves neither, opting for a TV-style, by-the-numbers approach. It could have been so much more.The story features four outcast girls (the sad, pouting Robin Tunney, the 29-year-old Rachel True, the mightily-boobed Neve Campbell, and the absolutely dee-lish Fairuza Balk) who come together to invoke the spirit of Manon (as sort-of universal deity with unlimited power) in order to satisfy their petty desires. Low-wattage drama with not one shred of an epic moment follows.I liked this film when I saw it in the cinema as a teenager, mainly because of the yummy girls. As an adult I can see that the film has lots of lame dialogue, bad editing, and poor photography. Revenge fantasies, especially for high school kids, are clichéd and old-fashioned as well as being dangerous. There's not much reason to watch this other than ogling the skin on show.Why this got an R-rating is beyond me. Apparently the MPAA regarded the witchcraft to be dangerous and insisted on an R when the film is clearly no harder than a PG-13. I think this is absolutely moronic. With their logic Harry Potter and Charmed should be for adults only.",The Craft
25,capone666,The Vidiot Reviews...,5,28 October 2010,"The CraftThe reason older women are so interested in witchcraft is because it allows them the opportunity to cast spells that can cause impotency in their ex-husbands.Fortunately, the four female practitioners of black magic in this hokey horror movie aren't a bunch of weary old witches, but nubile adolescents.When high school exiles (Robin Tunney, Neve Campbell, Fairuza Balk, Rachel True) experiment with witchcraft they discover that it can enhance their social standings and settle scores with tormenters.But playing with the occult proves to be hazardous for the girls and soon jealousy, overzealousness and a boy (Skeet Ulrich) comes between them.A cloudy concoction of teen angst, cattiness and necromancy, The Craft perfectly portrays the power and pitfalls of hocus-pocus from the female perspective.And while most would be opposed to witches being enrolled in their school, trust me, burning one before a pep rally really raises the kids' spirits.

26,The-Sarkologist,Power corrupts and abused power destroys,6,9 December 2011,"""Clueless meets Carrie"", and ""a slick, hip, smart arse movie,"" are what the critics allegedly call the movie (or so the back of the box says. For all we know the quote could have been ""it is not a slick  movie""). I have not seen Carrie (as of the time of writing), but The Craft is nothing like Clueless, nor is it slick, hip, or smart arse. It isn't a bad movie, but it isn't one that catapults to the top of excellence either.The Craft is about a girl who moves to Los Angeles and goes to a Catholic School. She begins as an outcast because she is new, and is pushed even further out when she refuses to go to bed with Chris, the school stud. As such she ends up joining with the school's misfits who are rumoured to be witches. They are actually witches, but they need a forth person to make their power work, and Sarah, the new kid, happens to be the perfect forth person.They claim to worship the god Mamoun, who is basically all of nature. They claim that Mamoun is older than any other god and is the only true god. God was only created by mankind who chose to ignore Mamoun. This I dispute because I believe Mamoun was created by man who did not want to worship the true God. Mamoun is nature while God is beyond nature as he created nature and as such expects us to look after it.Mamoun bestows these girls with magical powers, but whatever these girls do is revisited upon them three times. Sarah wants to get back at Chris so makes him fall in love with her, but this love spell backfires and she cannot get away from him. He is so madly in love with her that his sexual urges are fired up to the point where he is do anything to have sex with her, including raping her.Danny becomes corrupted by the power that she works with. She is little more than white trash, living in a small house with quarrelling parents. She wants out anyway she can so she basically asks for the power of Mamoun, but after somebody close to them dies Sarah wants out and Danny will not let her.This movie is about how power corrupts people if one is not careful. The one that was corrupted the most was the one that had the least. As such it seems that it is attacking the rags to riches philosophy. Those who are poor and powerless are that way because they do not know how to handle power. This is not always the case though because some poor people rise to power and are remembered for their goodness, while others who are born rich are intensely corrupt and abuse their power constantly.My friends rave about this movie, but I don't think that it is that great. It is just fancy effects and magic in the modern time with a pretty simple plot. The plot itself does not grab me and the characters have little depth. They are simply unpopular people who really want to become popular, and there is little else to them. Thus, unfortunately, is the way people are anyway.",The Craft
27,filipemanuelneto,It works better than most teen movies.,5,11 March 2017,"This film tells the story of a girl who changes from city and school, befriending a group of young witches who seem to practice a variation of Wicca. As a matter of fact, I know these themes well because I was the boyfriend of an assumed and proud young witch who, not being a Wicca practitioner, explained to me what it was: a neo-pagan cult inspired by the ancient Celtic and Druidic religion, that use to do some ceremonial witchcraft of European origin. But in the movie, the young girls ignore what my ex-girlfriend told me was one of the basic rules of witchcraft: the Law of Return (what you do ends up coming back to you). And that is precisely what will happen next, providing the audience with some of the most intense scenes. The plot uses witchcraft well enough, giving it some realism. I believe the fact of one of the actresses is a Wicca practitioner in real life has helped in this realism. The great sin of the film, however, is to be filled with the problems common to most teen films: stereotyped characters, clichés, perfectly unnecessary romance hints etc. All this stills the film some psychological depth and robs the scene of much more interesting issues, such as personality conflicts between characters, revenge, power and the way they feel seduced by it, among others. Another problem is the forced and unconvincing way the plot unfolds Sarah's past, the central character. About the cast, Robin Tunney (Sarah) did an OK performance but lacked to give it life. Being a complex character, with some psychological potential, she lacked the ability to externalize it. Fairuza Balk (Nancy) surprised in a dramatic, intense interpretation, sometimes exaggerating but in a way that didn't look bad. Rachel True (Rochelle) and Neve Campbell (Bonnie) are OK and comply with what was required of them. The result is a movie that entertains well, doesn't particularly scares but works better than most of teen movies.",The Craft

The cast is excellent with the then big star Neve Campbell (Scream films,Wild Things) & Fairuza Balk (American History X) & Rachel True (Groove) & Robin Tunney (End Of Days) this is a classy cast of then hot talent & all give excellent performances.
Robin Tunney is great as the new girl of the town & School & new girl to complete the group of witches, also Fairuza Balk really gives a strikingly scary & relentless performance as the psycho one of the group that goes too far but all are great here in a movie that is very dark, charming & fun all at the same time, definitely one of the best Teen Horror flicks of the 90's along with The Faculty, Disturbing Behaviour, Urban Legend & I Know what you did last summer, i grew up during the 90's so i have alot of Nostalgic love for these films & the actors of that time that nearly all seem to have gradually disappeared from the limelight & cinema.

37,aidanratesmovies,The Craft (1996)- Quite Enjoyable,9,29 September 2020,"Entertaining, with an interesting premise, and some engaging characters- The Craft has its flaws, but certainly makes for an enjoyable little creepy flick. All the actors involved did a decent job, I didn't feel anyone stood out as much as anyone else (at least in the main cast), but I did enjoy the girls chemistry on screen and found moments when they were together to be incredibly entertaining. The films biggest problems are its very beginning and somewhat tedious conclusion. The beginning seems like the most generic 90's teen film setup you could possibly imagine, and thus annoyed me so much in result. The ending seems to be awfully repetitive, and besides for a cool moment or two, kind of abrupt, as if the story was left to be open ended, but they didn't know how to make it that way. However, throughout the vast majority of this film, I did find myself really enjoying it. It has somewhat of a formulaic nature to it sure, but it truly makes the best with what it has, and is very entertaining to watch. In the end, The Craft is simply a fun little creepy flick to watch. It may not have the strengths of some other 90's horror classics, but it should certainly be appreciated as much, due to its great energy, well executed premise, and of course its stellar castwork.

38,questl-18592,Crafted,5,17 April 2021,"This may be one of the prime examples of a cult classic film. The kind of movie that warrants dressing up for trips to midnight showings and crazy parties.

I get why it has it's following but this just felt boring, sloppy and rushed. It doesn't help that the pivotal character here feels so clunky cobbled together, forced through her arc of ridiculously unnatural progression that never feels earned but is also the cornerstone of the film.Despite my overall indifference on the film though, I would still recommend this one to most folks.

39,rbverhoef,Entertaining enough,6,7 June 2005,"'The Craft' is sort of like 'The Witches of Eastwick' for teenagers starring Neve Campbell, Fairuza Balk, Robin Tunney and Rachel True as four witches who can do about anything they want. Campbell, True and especially Balk turn into evil witches and Tunney as the heroine has to make things right. I didn't like 'The Witches of Eastwick' very much, but thought 'The Craft' was surprisingly entertaining.It lacks the fun Jack Nicholson had in 'Eastwick', and great actresses like Michelle Pfeiffer and Susan Sarandon are not there either, but it combines comedy and drama in a pretty effective way. Especially the way the four find out they have great power when they are together creates a lot of fun moments. Later it is Balk who is really scary, even though we know exactly how it ends. 'The Craft' knows it is not a masterpiece, but it is an entertaining film and handles the material even with some intelligence form time to time.",The Craft
40,Reviews_of_the_Dead,Socially Relevant 90's Classic,8,7 June 2019,"This was a film I remember when it came out. It hit the movie channels and I saw this one quite a bit growing up with my sister. Back then, a lot of it was that even though these girls were older than me, I could relate with some of the issues they were dealing with and I wasn't too far off of their ages as well. The synopsis for this film is a newcomer to a Catholic prep high school falls in with a trio of outcast teenage girls who practice witchcraft. They all soon conjure up various spells and curses against those who anger them.We start this off with Sarah Bailey (Robin Tunney) moving to Los Angeles with her father, Cliff De Young, and his wife. Later in the film we learn that Sarah's real mother passed away during childbirth. She goes to school and we learn that she is a bit of a loner. She tries to befriend the trio of outcasts, but they ignore her.The trio is actually witches. Bonnie (Neve Campbell) is reading a horoscope, which is telling them they will make a discovery and she thinks it will be their fourth so they can conjure up some stronger spells. Nancy Downs (Fairuza Balk) isn't so sure and Rochelle (Rachel True) is pretty indifferent.In class Bonnie sees Sarah making a pencil stand on its own and she knows that Sarah must be their fourth. Sarah is also hit on by Chris Hooker (Skeet Ulrich). He warns her about hanging out with the witches. Nancy warns her about how much of a scumbag Chris actually is as well.Sarah falls in line with the girls and a local woman can tell that she is a natural witch, one that is quite powerful. This seems to bother Nancy who is their de facto leader. The crew has spells they want to make their lives better. Chris spreads a rumor about Sarah, but she wants him to like her. Nancy lives in a trailer with her mother and stepfather. It is a horrible life so she wants money to change her plight. Bonnie has low self-esteem from scars on her back. Rochelle is tormented by another girl, Laura (Christine Taylor).When their spells work, Nancy decides to do something even more powerful and things really start to get out of hand.The first thing that I really want to point out about this film is that it feels really 90's. I guess it is fitting that it came out right in the middle of the decade. It is also interesting that it came out the same year as Scream, with Campbell and Ulrich both starring in that film as well.Even watching this film 20+ years later, this film actually still holds up. A big aspect of this film is bullying in multiple forms. Sarah is bullied by Chris who makes up a rumor that they had sex. There are stories like this where people have killed themselves on rumors like this. Bonnie is mostly ignored due to her thinking she is ugly ands self-conscious about her scars. Nancy is bullied for being different and Rochelle for being a minority. It is crazy how relevant this aspect of the film is still to this day.Going from there, I also really like the change in the characters after they gain power. Sarah does stay the same until the climax. Nancy though becomes power hungry. You could call her a tyrant and quite evil. Bonnie with her new found confidence takes it overboard and actually becomes quite mean to everyone. Rochelle is really the only character who stays grounded. She feels horrible about what she wished on Laura. That becomes a bit theme of the film to be careful what you wish for.This concept of be careful what you wish for is something that we get quite a bit of. Sarah regrets casting the spell that she does on Chris, because he goes too far with it. He is constantly wanting to be with her and not giving her any space. It actually goes to darker things as well. Nancy also realizes that even with all of the money, her life still isn't what she wants it to be.One last concept in the film is that I love it is set at a Catholic high school. They don't really play that up much and we never see any of the nuns or priests scolding the girls, but I think it is an interesting setting for a coven. I definitely feel the film is aware of this and playing on that perversion of religion.Something that really helps bring this to life is the acting. I think the group of girls is all really good in their own individual ways. Tunney I think really comes off as aloof in the beginning and then really excited to fit in. We see though that she has issues with self-esteem. Not going to lie, I had a big crush on Tunney after this film and still kind of do. Balk is great in her role. She is callous and it just gets worse when she finds power. Campbell is interesting because her character has so much change. It really is night and day. I commend her for that. True shows a lot of heart for this role. She wants Laura punished, but seeing how far it goes actually makes her feel bad. It is fun to see Ulrich, Taylor, Breckin Meyer and Cliff De Young as well in their roles. The rest of the cast does round this out for what was needed.I think that with all of this, it is paced really well. I never find myself bored and it moves through things at a good rate. Something I really noticed with a critical eye, you start off thinking that the magic isn't real. It gradually escalates until the climax where things get really out of hand. There's a good showdown though at the end that really caps off this film in my opinion. I also like how it ends and the implications that come from it. I tend to think a lot of it is an allegory of overcoming your issues and becoming the strong person you always have inside. A big concept with Sarah who has a history of suicide attempts.I was really curious as to how the effects would hold up in this one, especially in this era where they weren't always the best. I do have to admit, I was definitely surprised because I think they were good. There are some minor gripes here and there. They don't go overboard with them, which is good. The ones that are used are pretty subtle and the film could pull them off. Overall though I would say that the effects were really good and help to bring this film to life. It is also shot very well with helps.To the soundtrack of the film, I would have to say that much like the feel of the movie, this aspect is also very 90's. I didn't really care for it as one that I would actually listen to, but it does fit the feel of the film. That is really all you can ask for and it never took me out of my enjoy either.Now with that said, this is one that I have a lot of nostalgia for and watched a lot growing up. I am surprised to see that it holds up. I think that it has a really good story, one that is really relevant. I like how they ground the witchcraft aspect of it and that it is believable the deeper that these girls get into it. The pacing of the film is good; it builds tension to a satisfying showdown and conclusion. I also think the implications there are solid. The effects were actually really good for the era. The soundtrack does fit, but not one that I'm in love with. I don't really have any issues with it, just not really my cup of tea when it comes to music. Overall though I'd say this is a good movie and would recommend giving it viewing, especially if you like films about witches.",The Craft
41,Samiam3,Spells before Screenplay,5,1 January 2011,"Time to go back to the old spell book.This movie about a girl who joins a circle of witches at her new school has more spells an black magic tricks than it has brain cells. It also has more characters than it knows what to do which. There are two types of people in The Craft: there are witches and non-witches. If you are a non-witch (and that's everybody but the four leads) your only role is to either have a spell cast on you or to be looked at as inferior to the witches. Whether you are a witch or not, you don't get much of a role. Consequently, the acting here is pretty poor especially from Fairuza Balk.But the biggest problem with the Craft is that is has no story to work with. It starts off okay, and for a while it looks like we may be going somewhere neat, but the more time we spend with Robin Tunney and her new 'sisters' the less fun they are to be around. We go in circles watching them chant and conduct rituals which do little more than make each other float. Conflict doesn't arise until the last twenty minutes, and it does so, it feels sloppy and contrived, (although I'll give a tad of credit for some genuine creepiness.) Otherwise, The Craft has nothing of appeal. It's dry, plodding and silly, and it needs to be rethought.",The Craft
42,triple8,Enjoyable with great special effects . Great cast.,7,3 December 2003,"I'm not gonna bother with an analysis of the supernatural aspect of this movie, I'm not qualified and don't have the knowledge on this particular subject matter. What I can say is I have seen it several times and found it to be a good movie, both fascinating and enjoyable-also a bit scary at times-great special effects-also a great movie to watch in a group-anybody who hasn't seen this and is thinking of renting it should go for it-you will not be bored! I enjoyed very much, the creative special effects and I thought the movie was well acted and was both interesting and tension provoking at the same time.my main problem was: SPOILERS:Toward the end, this movie gets extremely difficult to watch in parts, which would be fine except the movie does not play like a thriller through much of it, so your a bit unprepared when it starts becoming truly sinister. The pacing also becomes noticeably slower toward the end, and I have to say, although I've seen this several times and always enjoyed it, I lose a lot of my enjoyment when it starts really getting into thriller territory. Still, this is a good movie for the reasons already mentioned and I'd recommend it. I'd give it a 7.5 out of 10.",The Craft
43,p-stepien,Crafty but predictable,5,10 July 2009,"Sarah Bailey (Robin Tunney) is the new kid in a Catholic (nuns and all) high school. Moving into the neighbourhood and a drastic change of scenery was her father's idea of dealing with her teenage angst and suicidal tendencies. Despite being devoid of a mother (death during child birth) Sarah is quite a normal teenager apart from having quick a knack for magic.This is quickly picked up by the infamous dark threesome with a thing for witchcraft. Nancy Downs (Fairuza Balk) is a drop dead sexy Goth chick with an abusive stepfather fed up with being trailer trash. Bonnie (Neve Campbell) is insecure due to her skin being covered with burns. Rochelle (Rachel True) is the token black in the circle with dire problems with on-school racism.They are but three which means they miss a fourth to close the witches circle. Quite quickly they entice Sarah to join their little group of outcasts. Not long after they invoke to Manon, the master of all that is, with each of them making a personal wish, which they believe will improve their lives. Unknown to them the rule of three is in force - watch out what you wish for, because nature needs balance and everything you do will hit you back threefold.Balk, True and Campbell are a feast for the eye in this movie, although the latter two are essentially supporting cast and sadly Balk does not carry the role well trying to convey her character by shaking her head a lot, screaming and grinning. She remains sexy throughout the movie but it isn't enough to carry the plot-full script.The movie is likable but not a lot to admire, except for the girls beauty.",The Craft

I remember that ''The Craft'' was one of the very first movies about witchcraft I watched and liked a lot, and at that time I was all excited with Wicca and stuff like that.(But I know that this happened with a big number of people,specially girls) I only discovered this year that the actress who plays Nancy, Fairuza Balk , really is a witch: Maybe that's the reason why I think her looks and role are one of the best. It's funny to see Neve Campbell when she wasn't so famous as she is now. (By the way, it's my impression or she is inactive?) Sarah, played by Robin Tunney, is THE witch, the really powerful and good one, since her late mother was a powerful white witch, and unlike the other girls, she has the inherent gift of witchcraft herself.",The Craft
46,TedStixonAKAMaximumMadness,"""The Craft""- A cult-classic 90's horror flick that still entertains for the most part despite some major faults and a disjointed narrative.",7,25 September 2017,"Ah, 90's nostalgia. It's all the rage. For people of my generation, who came of age at the tail end of that delightful decade and the early 2000's, there's something just magical about looking back on the years of our youth with a yearning and adoration. And this is definitely reflected in the modern day market for nostalgic properties- movies and shows that we grew up with have fallen back into vogue and are even starting to be remade or revived. Stories and characters that we had drifted from have re-emerged through memes, kitschy products and fancy re-releases. And cult-classics from back in the day are gaining growing audiences as we revisit them and share them with newer generations.Which brings us to 1996's ""The Craft,"" directed and co-written by Andrew Fleming. While it was a minor hit back during its initial release, it was quickly overtaken by the shows and movies that followed. Being one of the first major released in quite some time to use witchcraft and Wicca as a major theme and backdrop, it ushered in many imitators, some good and some bad, and it got lost in the shuffle for a time. But over the past few years, it's slowly re- emerged and gained back its audience, becoming a bonafide cult- classic for the nostalgic folks like me who grew up in that millennial generation. Why, you can barely scroll through any social media site these days without stumbling upon a ""Craft"" reference or photo, usually accompanied by a humorous quip or in-joke.But this begs to question... Is ""The Craft"" really the underrated masterpiece that we so fondly remember it being? Or is it just the nostalgia talking? And honestly, it's hard to say. It's entertaining, no doubt. The cast is quite good. And it even boasts some very solid visual direction. And yet, it suffers a disjointed narrative and contrived scares that don't always hit home. It's a puzzling film to say the least. And yet, I couldn't help but completely enjoy it when I recently viewed it for the first time.""The Craft"" follows Sarah Bailey (Robin Tunney), the new girl in town whose just moved in and enrolled at the local Catholic school. There, she forms a strange but genuine friendship with a trio of outcasts comprised of Nancy (Fairuza Balk), Bonnie (Neve Campbell) and Rochelle (Rachel True)- the resident goth-chicks whom are widely despised and derided by their more popular peers. Sarah quickly finds herself drawn into their unique world, discovering that the trio worship and practice witchcraft, and are in need of one more member to complete their circle. At first apprehensive, Sarah eventually joins in and is shocked to discover that magic is all too real, and that she had seemingly unknowingly possessed its powers for some time prior... But also learns that despite the good it can do, every choice will have unforeseen consequences. Consequences that may tear the lives of the four girls apart as they grow greedy and apathetic thanks to their new powers...The thing I found most fascinating about the movie is the fact it does really hold your attention even when the film is plagued with some consistent and noticeable issues. And I attribute this mainly to the excellent cast and sharp direction. The four leads are a big key to making a film like this work, and all four feel perfect in their respective roles. I was particularly taken with Robin Tunney, who plays the most innocent of the four quite well and comes off as extremely likable and someone you can easily relate to. Campbell and True are both very good and play their roles very well. But special commendation definitely has to go to the very extremely talented and criminally under-recognized Fairuza Balk. She and Tunney more or less become the main focus on the film in its second half, and both play off of each other well, symbolizing the dangers of good things being taken to far.I was also very impressed with the production that Fleming crafts for the story, and it's a wonderfully competent and admirable piece of work. His smooth, steady camera-work is slick and stylish and always compliments the scenes well and he's got a keen eye for composition. He also knows where to place focus in terms of narrative, and he organically lets scenes play out at a natural pace, with everyone given their moment to shine. Combined with the wonderful cinematography of Alexander Gruszynski and a score by the always reliable Graeme Revell, and you have the stage set perfectly for such a dark and sometimes surprisingly amusing tale.Unfortunately, ""The Craft"" does falter and stumble on a very regular basis, and I really cannot ignore this fact. Although I do get the feeling it's more due to studio meddling and an over-eager editing team than due to Fleming. The pacing is a complete mess in the first two acts of the film, and I found myself often confused about things like motivation and intent. Heck, there was one or two early scenes where I lost track of the main characters because it was cut so tightly and they would seemingly appear and disappear from scenes. The attempts at genuine horror suffer from 90's ""music video syndrome"" and come off as laughable due to their blatancy instead of being chilling as they should be. And the narrative does rely a bit too much on audience good will and suspension of disbelief. It's just a bit... lazy at times.But that can't change the fact that this is a very fun film and I do think that those who are curious about it should give it a chance. Top-notch direction and an infectiously charming cast make all the difference, and help to redeem the film almost entirely for the plot and pacing related shortcomings. I give ""The Craft"" a pretty good 7 out of 10.",The Craft
47,rivertam26,awesomely wicked,9,28 July 2020,"With the threat of a new version I decided to revisit this childhood classic of mine which actually inspired me and my friends to try goth for a couple months, or maybe it was just me, lol. Well the movie holds up surprisingly well and some part of that may be due to nostalgia but I really loved it, maybe even more than before. Robin Tunney(End of Days) stars as Sara the new girl at school who falls into a group of outcast witches after being burned by the popular kids. Once she joins the coven the stars align and they begin to experience some real power. The only problem is the maniacal and charasmatic leader Nancy played by a feisty Fairuiza Balk (Island of Dr. Moreau) gets power hungry and takes her vengeance to another level. Rachael True (Half Baked) and the always awesome Neve Campbell star as the other two members battling their own problems and insecurities. What makes the film work so well is the sisterhood and sometimes twisted friendship of these girls. They feel genuine and their stories are relatable as they deal with every day problems ranging from rumors to racism, abuse and body issues. The witchcraft is an added bonus and unlike most films of it's kind it delivers on that aspect including a slightly short but effective finale. Christine Taylor (Brady Bunch), Skeet Ulrich (Scream) and Breckin Meyer (Clueless) also star. The film is confidently directed by Andrew Fleming of one of my favorite 80s flicks Bad Dreams with a screenplay by Peter Filardi of Flatliners. It also features an amazing soundtrack with songs by Our Lady Peace, Letters to Cleo, Love spit love and more. I'm sure who's ever reading this has a love for this film as I do, so maybe it's time for a revisit.Budget: $15M

48,gizmomogwai,Mostly well-crafted,7,5 October 2009,"I've been interested in seeing this movie for years now. I kind of have an interest in women with powers- from Medea in Greek mythology to Buffy the vampire slayer and Sabrina the teenage witch. Witch stories can be fun. It's a good movie to see as part of my reviewing of horror and Halloween-themed productions throughout this October.In this movie, a group of four girls practice witchcraft, but three of them begin taking this too far- they are, I guess you can say, seduced by the dark side of the force. As the fourth girl, Sarah, tries to distance herself from the mess being made, her former-friends turn against her.Is this movie anti-Wiccan propaganda? The matter is a concern since I have pagan sympathies myself. I don't think the word ""Wicca"" is used in the movie, unless I missed it, but the girls do practice a similar nature-based spirituality. But the point of this movie doesn't seem to be that magic is bad, just that it's a bad idea to abuse it. Both Sarah and the shop owner seem to be good witches.In terms of quality this is a mostly good movie. The performances and dialogue are mostly smooth, though the bad girl Nancy overdoes it a little, yelling ""He's sorry!"" when she basically kills Sarah's admirer. Likewise, the nightmare where the three bad witches come through the window is a little over the top. There isn't much characterization beyond that Nancy's bad and Sarah's the newer, learning, more innocent member of the group. On the whole, though, the movie's good fun.Happy Halloween.",The Craft

Fairuza Balk, as Nancy, whose moody pouting punky rebelliousness is particularly indignant and so, very watchable. They find that whilst their spells sort out their immediate gratifications (revenge on boys, then each other) the downsides that come about get bad. Especially when things get way out of hand.

51,jluis1984,A very good teen horror film!,8,20 August 2007,"Since its origins in the ""beach films"" of the 50s and 60s, the so-called ""teen film"" genre has been the target of much criticism despite its constant popularity among the audiences. A lot of this comes from the notorious tendency of teen films to be nothing more than clichéd stories done to cash in the popularity of celebrities or fashionable trends, and sadly teen horror, source of most of the worst horror films ever made, is a main offender in this aspect. However, not every horror film aimed to teenagers is dumb, as there have been movies that actually use the conventions of its genre to actually make something interesting and creative with it. Brian De Palma's classic, ""Carrie"", is probably the best example of this, as it intelligently uses teenage angst as source of horror. While nowhere near De Palma's masterpiece, Andrew Fleming's ""The Craft"" walks on the same lines with relative success.In ""The Craft"", Robin Tunney plays Sarah Bailey, a troubled teenage girl with suicidal tendencies who has recently moved with her family to Los Angeles in order to have a fresh start. In her new school, she meets Bonnie (Neve Campbell), Rochelle (Rachel True) and Nancy (Fairuza Balk), three outcast girls who have an interest in the occult and actually are practicing witches. Sarah is invited to join their group after Bonnie notices that Sarah seems to have the real supernatural powers of a natural witch, and after she joins them in their rituals, they discover that with her help they are able to achieve things beyond the normal witchcraft. With this real magical power, the four girls begin to solve their respective problems and everything seems to be perfect, until the ambition for more power overwhelm them, and they discover that everything has a price.Based on a story by Peter Filardi, ""The Craft"" was written by director Andrew Fleming and Filardi himself. It is essentially a teen drama with a touch of supernatural horror that, while predictable in its storyline, feels fresh and original thanks to the interesting plot that Filardi creatively develops. What makes it interesting is the amount of research that the writers put on the screenplay, as they based the rituals the characters practice in real witchcraft practices that followers of nature-based religions perform (obviously with exaggerated results); and what's most important, the angle they take on the story is not meant to be disrespectful to followers of those religions, but presents it as a philosophy as valid as any other faith. Of course, it's hard to escape the clichés of teen dramas, but Filardi never fails to make the story entertaining thanks to a good amount of character development.Director Andrew Fleming takes a very straight forward approach with ""The Craft"", following to the letter the typical conventions of the teen movie genre, with a dose comedy thrown to good effect, a very modern atmosphere and a polished visual look (courtesy of Alexander Gruszynski's cinematography) designed with the MTV generation in mind. While at first sight this may sound unoriginal, it actually adds to the film's charm, as the overall feeling that results as the horror elements begin to enter the story is one of a teen drama gone to the dark side. The special effects aren't really amazing but they work effectively and even today look pretty good and convincing. Fleming's directing of his cast is another of the elements that make the film good, as nearly everyone gives at least a good performance that helps the film in some way.As written above, the performances by the cast are something that makes the movie to stand out, starting with Fairuza Balk, who as the lonely and angry Nancy becomes easily the best actress in the cast. Going over-the-top as her character gets more power, Balk makes a villain that is as delightfully insane as she is sympathetic. Robin Tunney is a effective as Sarah, but her performance feels kind of weak when compared to Balk and even Neve Campbell (the fact that as the hero, her character is probably the most clichéd doesn't help). In the supporting roles, Neve Campbell and Rachel True are very good, specially Campbell who despite the relatively small size of the role shows why she would be the one whose career would rise in the following decade. Skeet Ulrich and Christine Taylor also appear in supporting roles with good results, although Ulrich seems to have troubles with his role.It would be easy to dismiss ""The Craft"" as just another teen horror film like the many weak movies the genre spawned in the late 90s, but even when it may not be a classic, ""The Craft"" has a lot going for it that makes it stand out among the rest. True, the story is predictable, disjointed at times, and truly loses some steam at the end; but the way Filardi plays with the moral conflicts between the characters as well as that of being an outcast and having magic powers is pretty interesting. That element together with the fact that it offers a different (and at the time fresh) view on witchcraft and nature-oriented religions makes ""The Craft"" an interesting and entertaining movie. Still, one has to remember that ""The Craft"" is first and foremost a supernatural teen drama, so anyone expecting a straight forward horror film will probably be disappointed. Despite its many flaws, ""The Craft"" is definitely one of the best American horror movies of the 90s, showing a true understanding of the 90s pop culture and a disposition to play with both the horror and teen movie genres. Sadly, few horror films followed this movie's path and most of the rest of the teen horror movies for the MTV generation ended up having the worst qualities of the genre. It's not ""Carrie"" but still, ""The Craft"" is one of the good ones. 8/10",The Craft

The music is fairly the same standard,but I don't think these girls have to worry about warlocks. Fairuza Balk's character is wonderfully dark and sympathetic in the beginning, but then spoils herself into just becoming just short of a Satanist with her tagalongs Rachel True and Neve Campbell who is not the main character for once in her life. That distinction definitely belongs to the captivating Robin Tunney who looks better in this movie than anything else I've ever seen her in.Fresh from Hull House Mortuary in ""Night of the Demons 2,"" we have Christine Taylor who is for once decidedly going anti-Marcia and then there's Skeet Ulrich about whom only the girls seem to care about at all.

57,Darkside-Reviewer,Blessed Be!,7,13 June 2020,"I first saw The Craft on VHS when I was a teenager in the early 2000s when DVD players were still new and expensive and honestly I fell in love with this movie for two reasonsThe first was I felt like the movie captured the Gothic teen craze of the 90s pretty well with it's relatable main characters who desire power in a world that they often view as cruel and unfair.The second reason is that even though the movie is meant primarily for teenagers it's story and character backgrounds tackle some serious issues that weren't usually explored in movies meant for teenagers especially in the 90s such as characters dealing with suicide, bullying, body issues and depression so while this movie is sometimes silly and over the top it also deals with some very mature themes.This movie is definitely one of the most influential and memorable teenage movies of the 90s and also one of the best in the witches sub genre and while it is a movie meant mainly for teenagers it still has a dark and serious theme to it. One of the most memorable things about this movie is it's great casting for the four main characters first is (Fairuza Balk) who plays Nancy Downs the dark, gothic and often crazy one of the coven next is (Robin Tunney) who plays Sarah Bailey the new witch in the group who brings the balance of light and dark to the coven then there's (Neve Campbell) who plays Bonnie the shy girl in the coven who's back is covered in scars that she hides but she longs to be normal last in the coven is (Rachel True) who plays Rochelle who's probably the most normal of the four but is the victim of bulling from the more popular girls at school.Interestingly this movie plays the Charmed theme song at one point in the movie two years before the first episode of Charmed aired which is a huge coincidence as Charmed story is also about a coven of witches just thought I'd include this fun piece of trivia for those fans of Charmed and The Craft.The best performance in the movie comes from (Fairuza Balk) her performance as Nancy really is unique giving her character a dark and crazy personality who looks and dresses like someone you would imagine as being a dark witch.I highly recommend watching this movie if your a fan of TV shows liked Charmed and Buffy the Vampire the slayer the movie may be a little dated now but it's still fun to watch and makes your feel nostalgic for the mid 90s.",The Craft

63,DavidSim240183,A teen film of smooth assurance. But blows it big time at the end,8,25 September 2007,"The Craft is a film that comes with an appealing idea. A coven of teenage witches use their magic for self-improvement that develops into self-empowerment. Its an idea ripe with possibilities. And for the most part The Craft is a sharp, witty and involving postmodern spin on witchcraft. So more's the pity that it loses the focus in the final act and ends the film on a shrill idiotic note.The coven in question is Sarah (Robin Tunney), the new girl in school who becomes the one who completes the circle. Nancy (Fairuza Balk), the cynical Goth who likes power a little too much. Bonnie (Neve Campbell), a scarred girl who turns her life around through magic. And Rochelle (Rachel True), the Black member who uses magic to combat the racists who make her life miserable.One thing that quite impressed me about The Craft was its direction. I liked the way Sarah arrives at school. She's told to stay away from Nancy, Bonnie and Rochelle. They're quite wittily described as the 'Bitches of Eastwick'. But Sarah's own innate magic power endears her to the others, and recognising them as kindred spirits, completes the coven.And once they're powers are combined, they take steps to become a force at their high school. In the case of Sarah, she takes revenge on a boy who humiliated her by casting a love spell on him. Nancy kills her abusive father through magic. Bonnie cures herself of the scars that have scarred her life. And Rochelle punishes a racist blonde girl by making her hair fall out.The film is smart enough to include the slowly developing consequences of each individual act. Sarah discovers having someone love you to death is dangerous. Nancy realises that power indeed does corrupt. Bonnie may look more beautiful on the outside, but in turn discovers the ugly side of human nature. And Rochelle discovers the line that separates bullied from bully is narrower then she thought.This may all sound a bit preachy and moralistic. But its the cleverly observed performances from the girls that makes The Craft very astute for three quarters of its running time.Robin Tunney turns in a smart and invigorating performance. She discovers power in her life, and her emotions rotate through fear, joy and horror at what she's become. Its an acutely observed piece of acting. Why she hasn't gone onto a rich acting career is frankly a mystery.The same could be said for Fairuza Balk. Before The Craft, she was most well known for playing Dorothy in Return to Oz. Her performance here is a whole 180 degrees removed. Her turn as the cynical Nancy is quite shocking by contrast. Decked out in white makeup, jet-black hair, nose-ring and leering grin that would make the Joker envious, she has a complete ball in the role.Hers is the most interesting character arc and she knows it. She knows the lust of power is too great a temptation, and her revelry in her own abilities is fun to watch. Her acting is broad and uninhibited but its tightly constrained within the boundaries of her character. Its only at the end she forgets that and ruins what was a fascinating piece of character development.Pre-Scream star Neve Campbell and Rachel True are only really supporting players to Tunney and Balk. They get to have fun with their roles, but they're only written in as minute performers and that's about it.Since The Craft uses high-school as a backdrop, it paints the girls coven in terms of not all dissimilar surroundings. There are times when they reminded me of an exclusive clique. But instead of a group of the most popular and well connected girls, they're a group that champions individuality and non-conformity. Its a witty reversal of what cliques are usually all about.For three quarters of its running time, The Craft is a well judged and well executed portrait of teen witchcraft. There are hilarious throwaway gags like the girls watching an episode of Bewitched. And it alternates with the girls powers going from innocent applications, like the beautiful scene of a swarm of butterflies embracing the girls, to their powers turning nasty. And I liked the subtle buildup. We know something dangerous is forming on the horizon.To return to the clique analogy, Nancy has always seen herself as the leader of the group. But when Sarah's powers prove greater than hers, it creates a shift in the group dynamic. Nancy feels threatened by her position being usurped, and takes steps to counter this, by fully worshipping the Dark Arts.This stage of the film should have been The Craft's triumphal moment. And yet somehow I was left disappointed. Up until that point, I had really enjoyed the shifts in loyalties and narrative turns, but its the way its played out in the final act that wrecks everything.Sarah and Nancy's battle could have made for some operatic developments. But the film's special effects start to take over. Beforehand they had been relatively restrained, leaving the actresses strengths and personalities to shine through. We get some really overblown scenes of Sarah's house swarming with scorpions, spiders, snakes, beetles, worms and maggots. And Fairuza Balk's acting here is horribly overdone. She lacks any menace. She looks plain silly trying to act insane and power mad. Almost reminiscent of Jack Nicholson at his worst.And the epilogue is a real wet blanket. Frankly it doesn't make much sense at all. What a shame! Films like The Craft really disappoint me. How they start out great and in control. And throw it all away for some neat sense of resolution. A mistake The Witches of Eastwick made. Relying upon a special effects climax in a misguided attempt to wrap everything up.I can't remember the last time I felt so cheated at the end of a film.",The Craft
64,malkane316,misunderstood,8,16 May 2004,"some reviewers seem to have the wrong idea about this film. no, it is not supposed to be scary, not in the traditional sense anyway.The nineties brought a resurgence of teen horror and comedy movies onto our screens. 90% of these are awful, but this one was different. The Craftrefuses to be labeled as horror or comedy, but has strong elements of both, and it is more akin to Heathers, than any other recent film. Campbell is as gorgeous as always, and her performance is good, Balk is superb, while the rest of the cast is respectable, and both the script and effects are sharp, giving the movie a darker tone than any of its contemporaries. The clichés are there, with the outsider becoming the hero, and the non-conforming females of the period show they can be happy and free. If happy means Goth. Forget your knowledge of magic if you have any, and your preconceptions about teen movies, because this one is cool, dark, entertaining stuff. 8 out of 10",The Craft
65,jayjaycee,Sabrina the emo witch,6,27 October 2020,"""The Craft"" is a 1996 horror drama directed by Andrew Fleming starring Robin Tunney and Fairuza Balk.
⚪
All in all, this witch flick casts a spell with its genuinely enchanting main characters and the way it interweaves witchcraft, outsiderdom and high school angst, and even if the overall plot is not really magnificent sorcery and the suspense is terribly build up most of the time, the themes it explores, the atmosphere and its basically fascinating nature as a strange genre mix make it an enjoyable teenage flick with some unexpectedly dark turns.
⚪
Last week I made a poll and let you people decide whether this flick here should be watched this season or be skipped completely, and for I love democracy and know that my community consists of competent cinephiles whose opinions mean a lot to me, I asked you. As you can see, the majority have voted for me to review it, and honestly, I had an unexpectedly decent time with this film. What is it, though? Well, as funny as it sounds, I think you can best describes this film as the answer to the question of what would happen if Sabrina the teenage witch listened to My Chemical Romance and liked films like ""Donnie Darko"", because this film is literally so emo and edgy. The story is quite simple: the new girl in town befriends a trio of outsider girls who are witches and finds out she is one herself, and then they have fun together before it all gets out of control. Well, this is basically all, and as I expected it no differently, the film fulfils all high school teenager flick stereotypes and clichés that exists, but I think every film targeted at this young audience does that to a certain degree. However, what makes it stick out compared to others is that the four enchantresses are all interestingly crafted and genuinely sympathetic personalities. Even if Robin Tunney plays the part of the new girl and at the same time protagonist Sarah decently, it is ""Return To Oz"" star Fairuza Balk who steals the show as chief Wiccan Nancy. Her character is unpredictable, merciless, and dark, and yet she also shows her vulnerability, humanity and defencelessness as well. However, regardless of how intriguing the premise is, there is not much done about some actually enthralling development. More than the first half of the film is spent with showing what those four witches are capable of and what tricks and spells they are able to cast, but it takes painfully long to create some sort of conflict that makes the promising exposition justice. Only far after the first half a real problem emerges, as Nancy and her friends underestimate her powers (you have read that in Anakin's voice, didn't you?) and become a danger to others and themselves. Regarding the ending, I am still torn. On one hand I just loved how it became unexpectedly dark and offered some aspects that I never expected to show up in a teenage horror flick (things concerning the pasts of members, don't wanna drop unnecessary spoilers here) and made the horror come to life in an eerie way, on the other hand it was completely unbalanced in terms of its indiviuals. The characters of future ""Scream"" superstar Neve Campbell and Rachel True were terribly pushed aside in order to establish a showdown between Sarah and Nancy that was underwhelming in some way as well. It is definitely far from perfect, but what is it that makes me take a liking in it, nevertheless? Well, believe it or not, this film is not like the average teenage fun flick. It more or less explores witchcraft in an interesting way, has a nice soundtrack and, as already mentioned, has countless unpredictably grim undertones. It is cheap and mindless fun for in between, and for this standard, it is outstanding. Bewitching, if you may call it like this.",The Craft
66,Thrashman88,Mediocre 90s Teen Flick,6,23 September 2019,"I was totally oblivious to ""The Craft"" when it was released in the mid 90s. Now, 20 something years later I've managed to see it for the 1st time. Other than having 4 hot looking teenage witches, ""The Craft"" has little else to offer. An uninteresting plot, lackluster special FX and a cringe worthy dialogue is all that this movie has to offer. I give it a 6 for nostalgic reasons, its hot looking witches and the (then) hip alternative rock soundtrack (which dates the movie even more).Other than that, ""The Craft"" is one of the most easily forgettable 90s flicks you'll ever see.",The Craft

But, otherwise a very good film. 8 out of 10.",The Craft
68,patriciogl10,The dark side of high school.,8,14 December 2019,"Whenever I think about this movie I always feel that it should be regarded as a 90s teen classic, if it isn't already. Just take a look at the reviews to see how much love does receive. That's mainly because it is a great film, one that explores teenagers from a darker perception, that is, real darkness, witches, dark magic, curses, rituals, the devil. Looking back, it has aged pretty well, as you can still make a movie about these topics in a high school environment and still get a decent response from the public.Being a female-led cast, it provides a different dynamic, in which all four girls seize their moment to stand out, even though the one who shines the most is undoubtedly Faruza Baulk, who shreds it to pieces with a highly memorable performance. The plot delivers the fantasy aspect quite respectably, without resorting to over the top effects and undertakings, always agreeing with plausibility without taking the fantasy too far.It's always refreshing to watch this film after some time, it's tremendously enjoyable.",The Craft
69,Cedric_Catsuits,"""We ARE the weirdos, Mister""",9,9 May 2006,"Almost a one-woman movie - without the almost totally raw, emotive performance from Fairuza Balk this would hardly be memorable. The plot is solid, the imaginative sets are nicely lit, and there are some accomplished performances from the young cast. But Ms Balk captivates, mesmerises, shocks, scares, and charms her way through every one of her scenes. Tunney may play the central character and has many of the best moments to herself, but Balk's range - from a cheeky wink to a full-blooded rage - is what provides the entertainment here.Watching it again now makes me wonder if it may have influenced elements of Buffy, especially the later Willow episodes. It has that same quality feel to it, same beautiful set design, even the magic shop looks familiar. The theme however is a little more adult, and the humour more low-key. Like Buffy, there is a certain morality to it all, and witchcraft is certainly not glamourized. Did Willow getting hooked and going off the rails in some part pay homage to Balk's performance here? Overall a likable movie and one I could watch over and over. Probably appeals to different generations on different levels, but I think it's a worthy piece of art and technically, quite brilliant in places.",The Craft
70,Darkest_Rose,I Love The Craft,10,18 December 2002,"The Craft is one of my favorite movies of all time. I just love it so much, everytime I watch it I go into this fantasy world. It's about a girl named sarah(Robin Tunney) she moves into a new town due to some bad past experiences. In the beginning everything goes great, she becomes best friends with these three girls that are interested in the occult and practice witchcraft. They are known as outsiders in the school, and when sarah becomes friends with them, they form a circle. Sarah feels wonderful, finally she feels like she belongs. The three girls consist of nancy, the gothic wicked leader(fairuza balk), bonnie, the insecure one(neve campbell), and rochelle, the shy one(Rachel True). Suddenly Sarah realizes that their spells and wicked fun have to come to an end. She feels like everything is going out of control and that the gang, especially Nancy is going a little insane and is using her power in evil ways. When Sarah tries to leave the circle, nancy turns her back on her and tries to ruin her life in every way she can. This is seriously a great movie, and if you are looking for a wicked fun time, definately see the craft. All the actresses are great, especially Fairuza Balk, she is so hot and so damn gorgeous. I would give The Craft 10/10",The Craft

74,Meredith-7,"Glossy & good-looking, but no substance",6,7 June 2000,"The Craft is very nice to look at, it has nice locations, great special effects and an attractive cast- but its not very substantial as a story.  It starts off very well, but loses itself somewhere in the last quarter. Robin Tunney and Fairuza Balk are excellent in their respective roles, and it was nice to see Neve Campbell in a supporting role - that doesn't seem to happen too often these days.  Of course the cast is probably one of the main reasons to see this film, aside from the four leads, there is also Skeet Ulrich, Breckin Meyer and Christine Taylor in supporting parts.  The problem with The Craft is that although it is slickly put together, it seems to be just special effects and slow motion shots of the four girls in various attire - almost like a 90 minute rock video.  Still its entertaining and, I think, one of the best films of its kind. Although it could have been better. Teens and Twenty-somethings will like it- almost everyone else will not.",The Craft
75,bayardhiler,Awesome Movie of the 90s,9,6 September 2012,"God, what an awesome movie this is! 1996's ""The Craft"" is one of those really cool movies from the 90s that they just don't make anymore. The film opens up to a group of teenage witches chanting for a fourth witch to come to them and complete their circle. Then, images of fire and Wiccan symbols fill the screen and the beginning of a cover version of ""Tommorrow Never Knows"" by Our Lady Peace blasts out at us. As soon as I saw that, I knew this was going to be good. Enters Sara, played by Robin Tunney of ""The Mentalist"", who is just arriving to a new town and school. There, she meets up with the outcast group of witches who are Nancy (Played by the great Fairuza Balk), Bonnie (played by Neve Campbell of ""Scream"" fame), and Rochelle (played by Rachel True who gives a convincing performance of being the only black person at her school). While reluctant at first, Sara eventually joins the coven and together they conjure up magic and life is good, at first. Each one wishes for something and they get it but at a cost. Since I don't want to spoil the movie for others, I won't go too much into detail about that. What I will say is ""The Craft"", while being about teenage girls and obviously being aimed at that group, is a movie that anyone can enjoy. First and foremost, who doesn't love magic and second it deals with the issue of feeling like an outsider and/or being picked on, and just about everyone would fall into one of those categories at least once in their life. Add in a great MTV generation soundtrack and you got yourself ""The Craft"". Don't miss it.",The Craft
76,LanceBrave,Nancy is Burning with Fear and Pain,7,3 April 2014,"A couple of things were popular in the late nineties. The sudden success of ""Scream"" made horror movies not only popular again but hip for the first time in years. Suddenly, the genre that had been masked madmen hacking up teens for a decade had to have sharp scripts and realistic, in-the-know protagonists. Around the same time, a rising awareness of new age pagan religions made ""witch"" a hot buzzword. Witches weren't green-skinned, cackling hags anymore. They could be normal people. These two interests intersected with ""The Craft,"" a poppy teen and femme-oriented horror flick that attempted to bring the witch concept into the present day.Set at a catholic school in fashionable California, the film follows Sarah, a girl with a history of mental problems, who has just moved into town. She's quickly dubbed an outcast and befriends a trio of other strange girls: The gothy Nancy, the shy Bonnie, and teased Rochelle. The three girls fancy themselves witches, in the neo-pagan sense of the word, and think Sarah might be the fourth corner of their circle. The fourth girls quickly excel at magic, using their abilities to better their high school lives. However, things quickly get out of hand, especially thanks to the unbalanced Nancy, and the girls start to turn on each other.""The Craft"" is notable for focusing on female characters, a rare feat in any genre but horror especially. The girls aren't your typical horror film victims. Instead, the script makes the effort to get inside each one's head. Nancy and the others are at the bottom of the high social ladder. Nancy's Gothic fashion seems to be in response to her home life, with a trashy mother and an abusive stepfather. Boys tell lies about her at school and her interest in witchcraft steams from a rather literal desire to take back control of her life. Bonnie's body is covered in burns, leading to her shyness. Rochelle's ethnicity makes her a target for bullying from the school's resident queen bee. When their power grows, they naturally use their abilities to improve their lives. Who can blame them? ""The Craft"" tries to frame itself as a story about responsibilities, how power corrupts etcetera, but the film is far more successful in its early half when the premise is played for wish-fulfillment.That's mostly due to the mostly strong cast. The movie made Fairuza Balk, who previously had experiences with witches in ""Return to Oz"" and ""The Worst Witch,"" something of a cult icon. She's the center of the film and gives a powerhouse performance. Nancy is burning with fear and pain, all of it exploding out as righteous anger. While the script isn't beyond playing her outburst as typical teenage angst, Balk deepens the role, making Nancy a real human being. Neve Campbell develops some honest anguish over her condition and, when she heals herself, has fun tramping it up. Rachel True works well as the first of the girls to notice they might have gone too far.The three are strong enough that they completely overshadow Robin Tunney as lead character Sarah. Tunney isn't bad but she's also playing the least interesting character in the film. While Nancy is speeding a car through red lights, magically changing them to green, Sarah is chastising them, like a real fuddy-duddy. Clearly, the other girls go too far, especially once they become murderous, but you can't deny they're having more fun. Making the hero so comparatively uninteresting is ""The Craft's"" biggest problem.The style of ""The Craft"" immediately marks it as a product of the late nineties. The soundtrack is filled out with quasi-pop punk that was quasi-popular at the time, like Sponge, Heather Nova, Letters to Cleo, and Love Spit Love, whose cover of ""How Soon is Now"" would later be used as the theme song for witch-centric TV show ""Charmed."" Andrew Fleming directs with rock-video smoothness, only occasionally overdoing it, like during Fairuza's murderous freak-out or a flying nightmare. The film's digital effects, which include morphing a girl's fingers into snakes, got a lot of press at the time. They come off as very dated today. The intensity the final witches duel produces has more to do with Fairuza's crazed acting then the melodramatic direction or cheesy effects.""The Craft"" became a sleeper hit upon release, meaning that its story and themes resonated with an audience. The film, no doubt, led to a rise in interest in witchcraft and neo-paganism. It also, probably, led to hip witch characters being a common character on supernatural soaps like ""Buffy"" and ""Charmed."" The film holds up astonishingly well, mostly thanks to its excellent cast and decently structured screenplay.",The Craft

But to give you a hint (most would be able to guess the title I'm thinking of anyway) - the B****** (rhymes with witches). For this show really shows how, when empowered with magical powers, a group of outcast girls can really bring harm and disharmony to everyone around them. To even want to kill the person who enabled these powers in them in the first place just because she happens to be a good witch and does not wish to harm anyone without good cause. I really liked some of the special effects - not too much to overpower the plot of the movie, but just enough to give you a sense of the enormity of the powers granted to the girls.

84,Panterken,Above average teenage horror.,6,12 March 2008,"Ah teen thriller movies: cliché-filled stories, pretty boys and girls casts and a thin plot. These movies usually don't have a lot of new content to offer the viewer and The Craft is no exception. The movie follows Sarah, a teenage witch who has recently moved to the small town (the unnamed town where the movie takes place) from San Francisco, the reason for her parents' decision is never explained. The audience is left to guess, but I think it's a safe assumption that Sarah stirred up some trouble with her witchcraft in the city. At first she isn't to keen on Nancy, Bonnie and Rochelle, a threesome who make no effort in hiding they're a coven of witches, but Sarah quickly has a spat with Chris Hooker (the name an unsubtle indication for his nature), one of the 'normal' high school kids and that leads to a (bit rushed) decision of joining the coven. In the beginning it's all fun and games, and the girls are like two hands on one belly but things turn awry when they invoke the spirit of the upper-god 'Manon'. The witches become drunk with power and Sarah soon finds out that getting out of the coven is a lot harder than getting in.The plot is not too insulting for our intelligence, keep in mind that we are watching a light thriller/horror mainly made for a young audience. It's only a means of escapism but entertaining non the less. Robin Tunney easily walks away with the honor of the best performance in the movie, Neve Campbell is not very convincing as usual and Fairuza Balk acts like she was born for this role. Of course, those of you who have seen her in 'the water boy' know that she's merely a one-trick pony so for range she scores very low. Also, she may be accused of overacting, although with the comic book like way these characters are written it's almost impossible to overact. It's no coincidence I almost forget to mention Rachel True's performance, not a single impressive scene comes to mind. She's the weakest link but acting has never been and never will be a priority in these types of movies. She's there to be pretty as is most of the rest of the cast. The 5.8 is undoubtedly pretty accurate when it comes to the rating of how good the movie is cinematically (above average but not far). If I had to rate this solely for entertainment value I'd definitely give it a 7. So this receives a tiny recommendation from me, and I think my score of 6.5 is fair.",The Craft

87,psycho_153,NOT DARK ENOUGH!!,6,30 December 1999,"This was an okay movie, but to make it better i think they should have made it much more darker, freakier, creepier which would have been a good watch. The witches in this are just playing games with witch craft, if they had became really bad and evil as the powers over took them it would have been much better. Fariza Bulks character was the only one which was satisfying.The story is A new girl moves to a new city with her family to start a new life. She meets up with the girls who are very interested in the occult and together, the four of them have a seemingly unstoppable power. They can do anything, from getting their dream guys to like them to... the possibilities are limitless An average movie, should have had a atmosphere like se7en or 8mm which were very dark this was to bright and comedic to be a scary movie, to be much more scary it should have had that evil feeling.",The Craft
88,IrisNo11,A Magical Masterpiece,10,31 July 1999,"The occult has been an influence on Hollywood for years, and ""The Craft"" is no exception!  This is one of the best movies made in the 1990's, with a solid cast and a wonderful plot, which can easily attract attention.  It's great, it's fun, it's spellbinding!  Neve Campbell, Rachel True, and Robin Tunney were good, but I thought that the best ""witch"" was Nancy, played by the very talented Faruza Balk, who is indeed a powerfully wonderful actress. Faruza gave the BEST performance out of all the witches to bring her strange and twisted character, Nancy, alive on the screen.""The Craft"" is more than just a movie...its a true masterpiece!",The Craft
89,Morbius_Fitzgerald,An above average horror flick.,7,10 May 2013,"Okay, first off I need to more or less shed some light on how I first watched this film. I first saw it when I was 13. I absolutely hated it. If you asked me ""does The Craft rate on your bottom 20 films?"" I would've answered with ""Yes."" I almost forgot about this movie until the start of this year when my brother sat me through Return To Oz. I more or less fell in love with Fairuza Balk's acting ability and due to that and the fact that I loved a film that runs along similar lines (Ginger Snaps) I decided it needs to be re-watched and to be honest, it wasn't bad.Okay, I have to say something about the acting. Neve Campbell, Fairuza Balk and even Rachel True put in solid enough performances but out of the three of them Fairuza feels like she is the only one really given any material to shine in. Unfortunately, as well, Robin Tunney was in the lead role and to pull off this specific role requires a great actress and Tunney was terrible. My mother introduced me to this movie, she loved it but even she had to admit that Tunney was awful.The plot; Three Wicca girls are awaiting a fourth member to join their group because they can't practice real magic without someone to back them up. Along comes Sarah Bailey, a girl who is a ""natural witch"". The three win her affections and become friends. They soon start practicing magic together after they describe their God; Manon. They all use spells to get back at people that have angered them; Nancy kills her father, Sarah makes a boy that used her actually love her, Bonnie removes the scars on her back, Rochelle makes the hair fall out of a popular girl who gave her sh!t. Soon the leader, Nancy organizes a ritual where she would be given the power of Manon. It succeeds but soon everything goes out of balance and Sarah has to find a way to stop it.Okay, this film is not perfect. The one thing that needed a bit more time is the script. If only Peter Filardi and Andrew Fleming had one more draft to work with. Just one more, I bet this film could've been an 8/10. I have given 8/10's to films with horrible acting before (Star Wars: Episode III) and I would go so far as to say that Tunney is the only problem besides the script so I would even say a 9.The visual style of this film is rather interesting to watch. While I have seen better cinematography and special effects, this film has enough ""realism"" to them to make me turn off ""Oh yeah, Nancy, Rochelle and Bonnie are flying into Sarah's room, trying to terrify her"" which is rather interesting considering I was only born this film was made and when I go to see a film made today and look at its visuals, I can't turn off because it is so obviously fake. I suppose I was born at the time when the plot was meant to serve the visual effects instead of the other way 'round.Overall this film is a great watch if your thing is a mindless horror film however this is not without its problems.",The Craft

Robin Tunney, fresh off the heels of Empire Records (and sporting a wig), moves to LA where she is to attend a catholic high school.

Her role had a major hint of token-ism, with no real action or dialogue, she seemed wasted in spite of appearing attractive and talented.

The emotional depth is also faulted, due to inconsistencies for each character largely due to uneven writing that makes the plot feel scripted. Character development therefore simply fails. The storyline is rushed, not providing good explanations for much of what occurs and at times skipping scenes entirely. Ironically, the film also progresses too slow, not moving to any remotely exciting sequences until too late. The conclusion almost feels as it should be satisfactory with reference to the story, but it is truly just unfulfilling. Overall, a disappointing film.",The Craft
95,daniele-iannarelli,"Not much substance, and grossly overlong...",4,1 January 2019,"Well, I started writing my review halfway through, tainted by the irritation I experienced with the grating music at the beginning, which didn't finish until nearly 8 minutes into the film.There was just no goal to this film, no aim, no real reason, just a simple easy-going, popcorn-brain, 'coming-of-age' flick about the escapades of a group of teenage girls. Furthermore, the director presented us with a grossly overlong movie with no explanation as to the significance of - for example - the running garter-snake theme amongst other curios.On this basis, I was reckoning on a rating of 2/10, and wondered what the point of it all was (and, to a degree, I'm still left wondering).However, at around 40mins or so towards the end, it did start to develop a bit of life, a bit of zest, verve, with some nice effects and a few life-morals. So, I decided to review and upgrade my previously considered rating.The major factor in my change of rating from a '2' to a '4' was the excellent performance by Fairuza Balk (as 'Nancy'). This actress, I felt, did brilliantly and believably and, by no small margin, overshadowed *everyone else* in this movie.This still doesn't detract from my assessment of the movie as way too long. Much of the introductory blurb (*at least* the first hour anyway) was completely unnecessary. Another, more competent, director (e.g. Hitchcock) could well have achieved all that was necessary, and more, in a much shorter time.If you intend watching this and, like me, can't be bothered with unnecessary bubblegum-head teenage tittle-tattle nonsense, I'd suggest starting watching about halfway. Trust me, you'd pick up on the gist (if there really is one) very easily and very quickly... there really is little substance to it.",The Craft

97,michael-3204,Good film that could have been great,5,4 January 2015,"I wanted to like The Craft more than I do. It has lots of appealing ingredients, including a pretty solid main cast and a story with lots of potential that puts young women front and center. I think my issues with it come down to tone and pacing. There are plenty of scenes that feel very natural and organic, especially those that feature the four main girls together; and then there are jarring scenes (for example, the vagrant with the snake) that seem to come from a different movie. Many of the adults (or, at least, the older actors playing adult roles, as opposed to the adult actors playing teenagers) are somewhat off, including Tunney's father and Assumpta Serna as the owner of the Wicca shop. Helen Shaver, as Fairuza Balk's trashy mother, gives the only performance that meshes well with what the teenagers are doing. Balk herself, though she excels at bringing menacing tension and unpredictability to her performance as the most unhinged of the four main girls, sometimes goes overboard with the histrionics, such as the bedroom scene with Skeet Ulrich at the party. The other girls' -- Robin Tunney, Neve Campbell and Rachel True -- performances stay more grounded through the movie, even as the increasingly unnatural events unfold. (Campbell and Ulrich, who would co-star as high school paramours in a film, Scream, that overshadowed this movie, don't have much interaction here, but I thought Ulrich was actually better -- and certainly funnier -- here as the bewitched, bothered and bewildered wanna-be boyfriend of Tunney.)All in all, the film feels like it wasn't thought through as thoroughly as it could have been. There are intriguing, post-Carrie ideas here about witchcraft and paganism as metaphors for girls' sexual development, but they don't really go anywhere even as the girls become more sexualized (and their skirts get shorter) as they become more confident in their craft. There are elements that feel forced or blunt -- such as the over-the-top overt racism shoved in True's character's face -- when a subtler approach would have been more effective and believable. There are the jarring tonal shifts that make me feel like director Andrew Fleming didn't have complete mastery of his own material. (Fleming also co-wrote the screenplay.) This is still a reasonably entertaining film with some effective scenes, memorable imagery and good performances. In more skillful hands or with more time and money, it could have been much more than that.",The Craft

She is told about the mysterious Bitches Of Eastwick, who call themselves witches. The REAL ones.

101,NoName1989,Not bad!,7,16 August 2006,"This movie was better than I expected. It's about a girl who moves and meets three girls at her new school, who seem to be practicing witchcraft... The movie certainly appealed to me, the acting was not bad, certainly Robin Tunney (who plays Veronica in ""Prison Break"") did a good job, but also Neve Campbell and Rachel True are acting alright. The only person of who I didn't like the acting, was Fairuza Balk. Her voice is (in this movie) not exactly the nicest voice to listen to. But she dóés have some good moments in this movie. Director Andrew Fleming, who's budget for The Craft wasn't so big, did a good job. The movie is -at least in the first half- a good combination between a thriller and a comedy, in the end, all the comedy disappears, the atmosphere darkens and we get a fairly exciting thriller. Some of the special effects are very good. The music was o.k., but (except for a few scenes) nothing more. If you have the chance to watch this, try it!

I liked the lead actress in another role years ago. ""The Boy Who Could Fly."" (I recommend that one, too.) You'll recognize another of the witches from ""The Waterboy"". The plot was titillating. I find myself thinking of this movie occasionally, even though I have only seen it once, and that was when it first came out. It definitely has elements of horror. If you scare easily, don't see this one. If you want your kids to see it, please watch it yourself first. (Unless you WANT your kids sharing your bed for a few weeks after.) I have wanted to see this one again, but I haven't had a chance. I don't own it, and I have young kids. It's rare I get to be alone with my husband to see a movie, so I usually choose something I've never seen before. I will see this one again someday, though. Suspend your belief and get into this one. I think it would be great to watch with friends. (Don't you like to see people react to scary movies? I'm one of the people you want to take to a scary movie.

Apart from a few glamour spells, petty revenges and several spectacular temper tantrums, none of the four young ladies stretches her powers to any great extent.There are some subtle and interesting undertones relating to female subjectivity and relationships (most of the male characters being either cardboard cut-outs and/or pawns for the females), but on the whole _The Craft_ falls rather flat.",The Craft

All of the actresses I believe did an excellent job in their respective roles. Most of what they talk about is extrapolated Wicca which is not Witchcraft. Traditional Witchcraft does not call watchtowers, etc. That got into Wicca because Gardner the originator, was a friend of Aleister Crowley. Wicca does revere nature but it is a hodge-podge of many beliefs depending on the form it takes. Traditional Witchcraft is regional and less ritualistic and they do not believe in 3-fold which is a 20th Century idea despite what they say in the movie, and why I cannot give this movie a 10 because it is misleading. I realize it is only a movie but I can see from what people have already said they thought they were performing witchcraft which isn't true and in Traditional Witchcraft, whether the spell performed be considered dark or not is on the conscience of the practitioner and not some retribution system so yes they could do curses but these generally are done only to protect family and as a last resort. There is no cumulative warning of some cosmic action. It is nice they called it the Craft to leave it open to interpretation. It is a pretty violent movie to be considered a teenage movie. I think it is an adult movie that has characters that are teenagers and there is a difference. It deals with dark topics including murder. Whether accurate in context it is a scary and entertaining movie but shouldn't be taken seriously or as an example of witchcraft in any form.",The Craft

Some will call the film out for its problematic messaging that could possibly say that women can't handle power or that they turn on one another when something better comes along, but I believe it's simply saying that power corrupts no matter how young or old you are or what gender you are.

111,kingderella,flawed but still enjoyable,5,6 May 2008,"neo-paganism was very popular amongst the teen crowd in the mid-90es, and ""the craft"" is the teen flick that cashed in on that trend. the movie is flawed but still enjoyable in a b-movie way.(very mild spoilers ahead. not that it really matters, since predictability is one of ""the craft""s problems.) the plot is about a coven of teenage witches who start using their powers for their own selfish goals, but then must learn the hard way that unleashing magical forces is much easier than controlling them, and that there is a price for everything. so far, so predictable. however, the story rarely follows its own rules: Sarah and Rochelle must never really pay for what they did to Chris and Laura. and why its implied that Bonnie has to pay for getting rid of her awful scars by having more scars, i don't understand; its not that she was hurting anyone with that spell. the general message comes across, but the story falls apart upon closer inspection.the performances are a mixed bag. Fairuza Balk is deliciously evil and Neve Campbell does a good job as well. but lead actress Robin Tunney is a bit too bland, and her character development from ordinary girl to reasonable witch to pathetic crybaby to super-tough power-wicca seems forced. Rachel True's presence is forgettable, but that has more to do with her painfully underwritten character than her acting.despite its many flaws, ""the craft"" is still breezy fun with its wish-fulfillment/power-fantasy story line and generally likable tone. just don't expect too much.",The Craft

Traditional Witchcraft is not like Wicca at all which is a Pagan religion developed by Gardner in the 20th Century. Many believe it is based on the ways of Witchcraft but the differences are like night and day. One must take the movie as totally baseless entertainment. It is more of a psychological thriller than a horror story but is well acted and delivered. All of the young actresses are a little old to be portraying High School students but it didn't detract from the movie at all.

117,KiteVega,Recommended...for some reason,5,27 October 2008,"I watched this film all the way through for the first time four years ago, when it was recommended to all Religious Studies students as part of a Paganism module. Interestingly, the lecturer who was so hot on this movie was a Pagan herself. Why she was so happy, then, to talk-up a movie that basically bludgeons Wiccans to within an inch of their lives remains to be seen. Perhaps the whole walking-boot wearing, vegan, home-made wine Paganism she followed was up for a rather bitter laugh at itself, but I'm not totally sure. She left the department soon after this and perhaps the fact that she recommended this mediocre movie to 200 students has something to do with it. The Craft, in a nutshell, is about a group of 4 misfits who use their growing magical powers for their own selfish ends. Predictably, one of them goes bonkers, one has an attack of conscience, and 2 are pathetic sheep who, of course, choose to follow Ms Nutter around committing increasingly unpleasant acts. The message of this film is confused from the outset. Despite apparently consulting a world-wide Paganism group to make sure the rituals and beliefs portrayed were 'accurate' I cannot help thinking that this film gives Wicca a good drubbing, whether it meant to or not. Ironically, near the beginning of the film, you see a wild-eyed fundamentalist Christian preaching on the wrong side of town. His compatriots appear to be hobos wielding snakes, but don't worry, because the super-cool and liberal Pagans soon appear to have very few redeeming features themselves. They are for the most part portrayed as vindictive lunatics who use their powers for reasons trivial, selfish or murderous. Changing your hair and eye colour, levitating your friends and throwing jocks out of the window is deur rigeur in teen Wiccan circles according to this. If you deviate, three astigmatic chicks crash through your window and attempt to kill you. Is this really how Pagans want to be portrayed? The film even includes the line, ""We are the weirdos, Mister!"" as the gals strut off to perform a ritual in the woods. Even the 'good witch' comes across as an unpleasant character towards the end, as she threatens 2 of her friends (a branch breaks off a tree in a crack of lightening in a shot that looks alarmingly like stock footage) and apparently relishes the fact that the 'bad witch' has ended up in an insane asylum. In addition to leaving a nasty taste in the mouth, the film has also dated horribly. Though 'Clueless' was 90s through and through, its excellent writing keeps it fresh. The Craft is nowhere near as well written, so the 90s Indie music and horrible, semi-goth fashions are glaringly obvious to the 21st century viewer. Another thing that erked me was, of course, the witches had to be goths, which reasserts the idea that Wiccans are all tortured teens going through a phase. Though the acting is good and the plot reasonable, The Craft remains an over-blown supernatural drama that sets out to entertain one type of person and one type of person only. Unfortunately, the rest of us won't be quite so intrigued.",The Craft

Unfortunately, seeing it again a number of years on and I can't believe that I ever enjoyed watching it. The four stars were horribly miscast and the characters they portrayed didn't make me believe in witches at all. Buffy the Vampire Slayer has produced more believable witchcraft than this.

There was the obligatory snobby racist blond chick (""I don't like Negroids"") and the dumb and malicious jock who wants to get Sarah (Robin Tunney) in the sack. I didn't buy either of those characters (the jock looked and sounded about 24 to me, definitely not a teenager).The vengeance on the crazy girl at the end was pathetic.

120,thornrosebud,"How is ""Charmed"" a rip off of this show? It's NOT.!",7,19 July 2020,"This was an interesting movie, especially for teen girls, but older men and women can enjoy it too. It seems to start off as a comedy but then gets a little dark. I watched it because I'm a fan of the TV series Charmed and heard that it was a rip off of this movie. That is ridiculous. Yes they are both about Witchcraft but that's the only thing. If you think Charmed is a rip off of this show then you would have to say that this show is a rip off of any past witchcraft shows that have a dark haired witch. I'm a huge fan of Robin Tunney but she is wrong when she makes this claim about ""Charmed"". I also think the reason fans think she was on ""Charmed"" is because it is a show about Witchcraft with an attractive dark haired female actress (Shannen Doherty) who Robin greatly resembles. Robin and Shannen are both gorgeous with high cheekbones and stunning eyes. If you like shows about witchcraft you may like this movie. However, ""Charmed"" is more about young strong women trying to save the world and ""The Craft"" is more about selfish teens maybe coming of age.",The Craft

The few actual Wicca-type things they show are shown in a positive and true light...that everything you do comes back to you three-fold (The Rule Of Three), that it does revolve around the elements, and that a big part of it (at least if you're in a Coven) stresses friendship. The entering of the Majick Circle was almost exactly like how entering a Wiccan Circle is done within a Coven. The rest of it, anything evil or forceful that happens, doesn't even exist in Wicca.  Menon was completely made-up for this film, and while I wish I could sometimes, we can't levitate or make things appear. 
And I especcially like how it shows love spells backfire.  The Wiccan Rede states, ""Do what thy will, an harm ye none"".  This means, NEVER try to control someone else's will.  The girls do just that, and look what happens.All in all, it definitely shows the divide between a Wiccan (like the woman who runs the majicks shop) and a movie witch.  10/10.",The Craft

Of course the movie offers a twist because these four young teens can cast spells to either benefit themselves or harm those who harm them.

126,moninm,It's alright,3,28 October 2019,"If you're looking for a cheesy, angsty, and sometimes subpar Halloween movie about witchcraft then this is the movie for you. (*Although, maybe don't watch if you have a phobia of snakes, rats, insects, or other vermin)
It's premise wasn't bad, but it failed to follow through in certain aspects of the plot and specific storylines. Viewers never really get to know the woman who ran the Wiccan store and helped Sarah as well as Sarah's mother, which were missed opportunities.
The ending was not satisfying due to the fact that Rochelle, Bonnie, and Nancy never seem to understand that what they did was wrong despite the consequences they face. I also think that by reversing the order of the last two scenes, the viewer ends on a slightly better note.
There is a lot of untapped potential to this film because it begs the question, if you had the power to solve seemingly unsolvable problems in life - would you? It's an intriguing question which is perhaps why a remake is in the works.
Some movies can get away with bad sound recording and it's a job in Hollywood that is sadly overlooked more often than not. Unfortunately the dubbing/ADR for The Craft was so bad it takes the viewer out of the film's environment.",The Craft

129,argento6,Girls Know Their Craft,8,22 June 2016,"Director Andrew Fleming was not a familiar name in the middle nineties in my case. But later on I watched his first feature horror film starring a young Jennifer Rubin, BAD DREAMS (1988). Fleming never became one of my interests but let' say that THE CRAFT, released in 1996 is one of these things that caught my attention as a young teenager. And this is another one of those ""like it or Leave it"" kind of film, among tons of other cheesy teen films released during that era. I loved it and still like it to this day. Even more, it is probably one of my favorite gems of this genre and decade. Thanks to the actresses.Sarah (Robin Tunney) is a young girl that doesn't seem to fit in. That until she moves with her father from San Fransisco to Los Angeles, where she learns in private school, that she isn't the only one in her situation. She soon starts hanging out with three other rejects. Believed to be gifted with the ability to perform magic, the girls are looking for a fourth member to complete their circle. But what Sarah soon learns is that not everything is grey in the heart of a true witch.With THE CRAFT, Fleming and Peter Filardi managed to come up with a pretty fun pop-corn film and dug up a beautiful and fascinating cast of actresses. Most of all, the fourth were able to make us believe that they were both very thigh together and that they were convincing teenagers despite the eight years that separates the elder from the youngest. Neve Campbell did good in her first feature film in Hollywood as the shy Bonnie, a character which suits Campbell like a glove since I rarely have seen her playing a fierce, determined woman or a crazy with such convincing talent. It's a shame that we haven't seen a lot of Robin Tunney and/or Rachel True in theaters or commercial films afterwards. But I do remember Tunney's turn in the disappointing End of Days with Gabriel Byrne and Arnold Scharz Hum, he's five times mister universe and the terminator you know who I'm talking about. Back to Tunney, I thought she played a commendable version of the Heroine à la Bella from Twilight (I will endure comparison but I hated the first film and couldn't bare watching the sequels.) And last but not least, there's Fairuza Balk, in the role of Nancy Downs. She looks way shorter than the others but never let it show throughout the film. She even manages to carry it on her shoulders for the most part, portraying a sometimes candid, other times unstable leader. And if she goes as far as to make some parts a caricature. She also bursts through the screen and that kind of performance in that particular flick is more than welcome in my opinion. She takes a lot of space that she's granted with from the crew I'm sure. The problem is that she may have made that particular character way bigger than she'll ever be in real life. (This is The Joker vs Batman when the Prince of crime is involved in an episode against the dark knight and never the other way around after all). If this is far from my favorite performance of hers, this is surely one to watch.But going deeper than the casting alone, THE CRAFT shows thousands of flaws. Because the writer(s) may have wanted to make it a cool fiction about witchcraft, without turning it into a joke, one thing must be hard to do when you are writing a story for teenagers, involving teenagers and you want to see it granted a PG13. That it managed to get itself an R rate is beyond me. Let alone the subject. There are a couple curse words here and there but that's about it. Let's get back to the serious(?) of the thing shall we? It seems Fairuza Balk was really into Gothic and Wicca at the time, she even did a lot of research about it in order to perfect her part. Still, she ironically plays the character that ended up with the most ridiculous holes in development. How come she has the means to go to private school and own the uniform if she's as poor as the poorest people alive in the first place? Still, who cares for character development for this one. I had a lot of fun. Another brain freeze is a scene involving the four ladies and sea animals. That scene was so irritating; I wonder how they decided to keep that instead of one of the few cheesy bits that we can see as cut scenes on the DVD's extras.But, if only for the fact that it might have given girls of my time a little or too much confidence sometimes and if only for the fact that the lovely Fairuza Balk ended up with all the best lines and shots. She often sports demonstrative and crazy eyes, yet there are also great close ups of those piercing blue gems of hers. And for a use of CG that was kept to a minimum, exploiting special effects in a subtle, yet intriguing way, never turning the scenes into the ridiculousness that it could have been if it ended up looking like an annoying cartoon, I think it deserves one viewing.And with the amount of talks about a remake, I don't know. Yes, I'd just forget about it. But can they still make this one better? Despite how much I like it, I think yes. But boy, I don't want to see forgettable names such as Kristen Stewart and Rooney Mara in the lead roles! And if they happen to find an actress as great to look creepy and as crazy as Fairuza can act, I'd say why not? Go for it.",The Craft

137,moontiger5,The perfect high school movie and not at all insulting,8,2 August 2006,"Though billed as a horror movie, this film left me chuckling knowingly. High school *is* like this, minus the intervention of supernatural powers, which I definitely would have appreciated during those days! The manipulating supposed best friends, the sex-crazed overbearing guys, the well-meaning bumbling adults, the angst and death wishes, it's all here and amplified by special effects no less. Fairuza Balk, Neve Campbell and Rachel True are in their element as the outcasts who recur to magical incantations to turn their sad state of affairs around and wreak havoc on those who exclude them. Robin Tunney also portrays very well the new girl in town who is already struggling without her mother to ease the bump of adolescence.Regarding the portrayal of the pagan elements, I must say I did not find it insulting. The writers of this script did their homework on Celtic mythology and gifted their audience with a very powerful depiction of Manannan MacLir, Ruler of the Ocean (this is the meaning of the marine animals who beached themselves following the ritual at the beach). Also, the architecture of Wiccan ritual is accurately portrayed, more so when the personalities and preferences of the four girls echo the correspondences of the Four Quarters. Also, there is valuable advice in the storyline: ""Be careful what you ask for, you just might get it,"" and ""Seek the power within."" Of course, the suggestion that one can forcefully enlist Nature to realise the common teenage dream of ""taking over the world"" is grossly misleading, but this does not detract from the entertainment provided by this stylish film.",The Craft

It should've been clear to the screenwriter that this was a bad idea to begin with, but what is truly pathetic is that the production company allowed this hunk of cinematic vomit to get to the silver screen. How do they sleep at night with this movie on their conscience? This film has one thing going for it, the one thing it got right for it, the special effects (sort of). It always seemed to me that a good movie should judged by it's story and plot line, but clearly the production company doesn't hold this view.

I'm not really sure why they try to kill her actually, like, it wasn't made clear why. The viewer can imagine it's because she wants to stop them. I mean she does put a binding spell on the evil girl but the spell doesn't even work so she's rather harmless so why kill the witch, ay?It's understandable too I read another review saying the evil witch steals the show. She does kind of, stealing it is a good way to call what she does, but she also expresses some emotions that are almost out of place. For some reason I still freaking loved this movie.

Never do what I did, so you'll never have to live with what you've done."" I highly doubt that I will do it. Not after my internet experience with a demon AND not after I watched that movie.The movie was awesome. I love it. The best part of The Craft was when Sarah found out her mother was a witch too.

164,nadsev,I recommend for people who want to get into slightly scary stuff,10,16 September 2021,"I LOVE this movie! I think the stories plot is amazing, and I'm a teen so it kinda targets me. As someone who practices witchcraft and Wicca, this is among the better films. In other films they will always make witchcraft bad and use pentacles as demonic which drives me absolutely insane!!! I wouldnt say it's reliable info obviously, but I think it captures the culture better than a lot of other things! As for the scariness and all that, I don't think it too bad! Me and my friends are gonna have a Halloween party and I thought this would be good bc I have friends who are kinda into witchcraft, and it's not too inappropriate! Of course the ending scarred me for a week or two, but in the long run I got over it and I can't think of a better ending for this movie. Plus the FASHION!*chefs kiss* so iconic, I absolutely adore it! This could become one of my favorite movies! Watched this last Halloween too, and I wanna make it a tradition! I was going to watch the shining but decided it'd be too scary to watch on a Halloween night with just my mum, so this is a good start for slightly scary things. Since my friends can't handle scary, this would be a good option! I'd recommend not watching this if you are younger than 12 unless you are often exposed to inappropriate things! I'd totally recommend it!",The Craft
165,midnightblossom15,One of the best movies,10,31 July 2007,"The Craft was like one of the best movies I have ever seen. It has everything, deadly romance, seduction, wicca, witchcraft, (by the way wicca and witchcraft are NOT the samething, wicca is pure energy, used for helping and for good, witchcraft is for evil doing.) fear, and so much more. I wish that there was a second one. Although sequels sometimes ruin the first. The cast made it an even better movie. The cast always plays a major role in any movie. I like that their are many themes in one. It is not just a one theme. It has a new girl in a different school, with people who are different than her in more than one way. It is a thrilling movie to watch. And it is one of those movies that you can keep watching over and over again. I feel that what elements are in this movie are right and touch base with a lot of things outside of the movie.",The Craft

It freaked me out a bit the first time I saw it but now as I'm older instead of being scared of this film I have fallen in love with it.  It is one of those films that it doesn't matter if you've watched it 100 times you still reach for it when you feel like watching a film.  The actings brilliant especially from Fairuza Bulk.  This was the first time I'd ever seen her in a film and she completely blew me away with her brilliant performance.  This film also has some funny moments e.g ""She's gonna cry, then I'm gonna cry, we're all gonna cry!"" You really have to watch the film to find that amusing.  Can I also say any film with Skeet Ulrich in it must be worth watching!!! Lol.Go and watch this film, you will regret it if you don't!!!

She meets a guy, and three girls make her think that he's a bad guy(which he kind of is) which is how she meets the three girls, one of the girls saw that Sarah had powers(she was spinning a pencil on the tip without touching it) so they invite her to be in there cult. Well she joins for fun, which it is at first, but the main girl(Nancy) starts doing evil things, and she decides it's starting to get out of hand, so she asks to leave and Nancy gets angry, because she needs 4 girls to complete the circle. So they let her leave, but then they start doing bad things to her... they want there revenge. Sarah has to stand against it, and use her white magic to defeat the black magic. But will she?

170,chadd-firchau,The Crapft,4,14 October 2017,"This flick has a very standard teen-movie formula. It's like Airbourne or Hackers, except instead of rollerblading and hacking, it's witch craft. The protagonist, Sarah, is the new girl in school. She butts heads with the bad crowd and then eventually joins their gang until the final showdown in the end. The leader of the coven is Nancy, played by Fairuza Balk. She got that ugly-hott going on. I always had a crush on her. She looks like the kind of trashy girl who can shot-gun a beer. There's some mondo continuity errors in the characters of this movie. For example, Sarah freaks out when her friends' spells and hi-jinx get a couple people killed. She no longer wants to be part of their club. But why would this bother her? At the beginning of the movie, a homeless person is nailed with a car, and they're laughing and celebrating because they think they made it happen with a spell. This is how they become friends in the first place: by killing a dude.One of the witches, Rochelle, starts to feel really guilty about putting a curse on some babe-zilla bully that causes all her hair to fall out. She shows no remorse, however, for any of the deaths and she has no qualms with trying to kill Sarah and her entire family at the end of the movie. It's like the writer of this script has ADD so bad that he can't even pay attention to his own writing. He forgot what he wrote one page ago as he pulls this whole thing out of his butt. This movie is pretty cheesy, but I feel it could be cheesier. I probably just don't get it because I'm a boy. Maybe if Van Damme were in it, I'd like it more.",The Craft

Four out-casted girls form a coven and use their powers in ways which inadvertently destroy the lives of the people close to them and ultimately their own lives.Its pretty scary actually with a great performance from Fairuza Balk as Nancy who really brings the whole film alive. It also incorporates a number of teenage issues and problems such as relationships, friendships, depression and racism. Its fair to say that this is a pretty cool film using the familiar idea of the outcasts getting their own back, however with an inevitable moral twist at the end. Its worth checking out though and the soundtrack's worth a listen with a pretty decent cover of 'How Soon Is Now' ( I'm not sure who does the cover)",The Craft
173,lmessmj,Good and bad collide in an extravagant magical way,10,27 September 2005,"I think this movie is excellent compared to most witchcraft movies. More realistic yet enough Hollywood to keep it going, great performances and wonderful special effects. The story line is compelling and and does not get stale or overrated. I think this movie was yet another hit for Robin Tunney and Neve Campbell. Rachel True and Fairuza Balk or also superb in their roles. For those of you who are Skeet Ulrich fans, his character of Chris was very believable and well cast. Overall, if you are a believer in witchcraft or just like to be entertained by a great witchcraft movie, and if you like Practical Magic and Spellbinder, The Craft is the movie for you.",The Craft

176,Pathogen-2,Modern witchcraft at it's finest,10,13 September 1999,"The Craft is a powerful movie with several images that invoke fear and thought. There is comedy underlying in the theme of teen age witches, but the story itself is a bleak twisting tale of personal misery and a power struggle.A little magic goes a long way in granting the wishes of the girls, but becomes a bit much as things go out of control outside and inside the coven itself. ""Nancy"" is a character that will stick with you as gothic wickedness incarnate.Two thumbs up. Strongly recommended.",The Craft

178,taint_the_bullet,The Craft,8,9 April 2006,"This movie is entertaining in many aspects and it has grown to be my favorite. However a good majority of the movie is based on fictionary assumptions relating to actual paganism and witchcraft. Being wiccan myself I found a lot of parts in this movie to be untrue to the real aspects of magick. but On the other hand they make many true statements (For example when they talk about the ""Threefold law"" ). Nancy Downs is my favorite character in the film because Fairuza Balk is personally my all time hero. Neve Campbell's performance was outstanding. I think I almost liked her in this as opposed to ""Scream"". I was a little disappointed by Robbin Tunney's role because she made the character seem a little bland and too ordinary. I would have liked to see Sarah played with some more attitude. Rachel True was excellent in this though, I thought her role as Rochelle was phenomenal!

Granted, it is a highly exaggerated example of the Pagan/Wiccan way of life with powerful girls running around in short skirts. However, there are deeper themes woven into the plot. In Wicca there is the rule of karma, and the 3x3 rule is highly looked upon and when ignored has extreme consequences. I am a practitioner of Wicca and I know this firsthand. There is no hair changing or walking on water, but these powers were all in showing exactly which characters the movie focused on. Some people did not understand that the movie was for entertainment, with a real lesson deep inside the special effects. Research Wicca and Paganism to an extent, and then watch the movie.

It tells the story of a coven of teen witches who meet up with a new girl who has just moved into town... through a series of exciting events that take place they realize that together as a foursome they are very powerful and possess great magical powers. However, when the original three abuse this power it is up to the new girl to stop them in a battle of magic which will definitely leave you on the edge of your seat!

189,dunkeldasrosenol,Whats the deal?,7,31 January 2005,"I'm not quite sure why everyone wants to kick this movie down... Sure, the plot wasn't amazing, but it functioned. Some of the scenes were badly directed, but contrasted by some surprisingly well directed scenes. To me this movie really wasn't about magic, but characters. Each character was unique and had their own sub-plot, which is something not done often enough. I was particularly fond of Fairuza Balks character Nancy, who i felt was the deepest and most interesting of the characters. The character had layers. Her exterior is mean and frightening, but under it she was actually a pretty cool person with a good sense of humor. I didn't like the way they made her into a psycho killer completely tripped out on her own power, but it also sets it up for a sequel. Despite what everyone else thinks, I think a sequel for this film has great potential. Of course, with more emphasis on the character driven features they tried to give the first. Less campy spell dialog, a little more humanity, and ALL returning characters (and actors/actresses) plus a few, and i'de go see it. Hell, i'de even write it.",The Craft

Acting could be better, however, I suspect that this low budget movie got what it paid for. An effort was made to appeal to the female high school genre and the normal interaction with the male sex, which to some degree worked, however, as general entertainment, it failed. A gallant attempt was made in regard to special effects, however, coupled with the weak story line and below par acting and direction, this was not enough. I was pleasantly surprised by the obvious attempt to examine the more complex machinations of the female teenage mind during the traumatic high school years and their attempts to solve problems through witchcraft. This movie is still quite watchable and I believe will still appeal to certain teenagers and their outlook on life, and perhaps should not be taken too seriously.",The Craft
191,mr-mvriley,A classic teen horror film with strong messages,10,15 February 2014,"The Craft is one of my favorite movies partly because of my interest in the supernatural and because growing up I use to be very interested in witchcraft. This movie has something that almost any teen can relate to. Seriously, what teen hasn't been bullied, tried changing their looks to make them more beautiful, thought about committing suicide, had relationship problems, or lived in an unstable or poor family environment? Another thing that is great about this movie and makes it different from most other witch movies I have seen is that a lot of the rituals and spells are based on actual Wiccan rites and practices. I think the moral of story says something about power and control and the basic principle that whatever you send out into the world comes back to you. For example, if you send out negative energy, you will get negative energy back and if you send out positive energy you will get positive energy back. The Craft is a creepy, suspenseful blend of the supernatural and teen drama that will captivate you. One of my all time favorites. Watch it, it will not disappoint!",The Craft
192,persephones_beloved,Good take on modern Wicca,10,12 August 2006,"While the God they chose was made up for the film, the elements of it were fairly faithful to its origins. They had a witch working with them on the set that helped amend the spells and incantations to suit the film, and Sarah's comment, that nothing makes everything all better again, is very accurate and what witches believe. Nothing is a quick fix.Very entertaining film, and has been good at putting a brighter light to all things Wicca. Although, it has to be said, the physical powers manifested in the girls are not what really happens in real life witchcraft, as sad as that sounds!

I believe in magic, real magic, and I think that this movie really portrayed what magic really is. in the special features, ""conjuring the craft"" Faruzia Balk said something that really connected with me. So i'll quote her: She said, ""Usually when people try to market magic, they twist it to make it look, evil, or silly, or stupid."" I don't think that many people understood that, but I did. I mean what is usually marketed out there isn't the reality of magic, and it is insulting sometimes. But this movie wasn't insulting at all, it was the truth.

Did she tell someone Nancy was crazy.When she said that to Rochelle and Bonnie I was just really confused and then they went to the part when Nancy was in the Rehab. Center. So how did she end up that way?Also how did Nancy become so crazy at the end?Did Sarah do that to her.Because Sarah binded her is that why Nancys crazy.Also what happened at the magic shop?What was the deal with the explosion.Did that scare Sarah. Was that from Nancy Rochelle and Bonnie or was that just magic.Then Sarah left and went to her house. Did she not feel safe doing the spell.,The Craft

I am not saying the exaggeration of the movie is real. It just over emphasizes to make a point. Not only that, it is entertaining and the cast is well chosen. The movie also gives some cool light on the shop owner, who knows about magick.

196,Wiccan2005,Gives Wiccan's a bad name!,1,20 November 2005,"This is an overall stupid movie, and it seriously gives Wiccan's a bad name. I personally think that ""The Craft"" makes Wiccan's look bad, as well as giving them a bad name. I am a Wiccan and have been for nearly a year. Wiccan's are not evil, satanic, a cult, a clan. we don't use evil powers to harm others, and we don't claim that ""If one leaves the clan they will be killed"" (not worded exactly as in the movie) Not only does it give Wiccan's a bad name, it's story line is lame, and it is full of Hollywood's look on Wicca, which is almost in every case, crap. I hope that if you would like to know more about Wicca you will read a book about it not use this awful movie for information on Wicca because it is false as well as pathetically lame.",The Craft

Robin Tunney is an amazing actress she truly shines in this film.The thematic element of the film was amazing I still get scared watching it. The limited use of the special effects worked out. There were just enough effects in the movie, so it wasn't spoiled by them. The movie showed a true side of magic it wasn't fake or watered down like some movies about magic. They truly tried to reveal some of the real elements of it. It also showed what it was like for the outcasts in high school, and what it was like to be different.

198,jimlav_06,My first ever review,8,6 May 2006,"I think The Craft is a really good film i first saw it in 2000 and the second time May 2006,it has a great cast with whom 2 cast members (Neve Campbell) and (Skeet Ulrich) went to star in the 1997 smash horror Scream as Sydney Prescott and Billy Loomis.It also stars Robin Tunney who was the girl in 'End Of Days' opposite Arnold Shwarzenegger and the girl with the scary eyes 'Fairaza Balk' who probably in her best role to date.The Craft is hip,sexy,weired and some OK special FX for a film out in 1996 with not that much budget.It is a really good film the first time I would give it 8 out of 10 for the first time and 7 for any other.If your after a good solid film to watch at the weekend The Craft is that thanks and I hope its been some help.",The Craft
