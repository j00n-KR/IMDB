0,Horst_In_Translation,"Not a silver medal for this movie, bronze at best",6,12 December 2018,"""Under the Silver Lake"" (I think the lake is not important enough throughout the film to warrant this title inclusion) is a new award-winning 2018 movie written and directed by David Robert Mitchell, his third full feature movie and he is still off to a good start for sure as I certainly enjoyed the watch here. But it could have been a bit shorter in my opinion as this one runs for a massive 2 hours and 20 minutes. The central character is played by Andrew Garfield and you don't see him too often in movies these days, which is a bit of a pity as I like him and I am sure many females do too as he is pretty handsome still pulling off that boyish thingey. Now before we go too much into physics, I think he is also a gifted actor and most other dudes his age would not have been as good as he was being in almost every scene in this extremely long film. Nobody else has much screen time either. Keough looks pretty stunning too and appears very early and very late, but not even there makes as much of an impact as Garfield. It is his movie.Sadly, the script is not always on par with his performance. I think this could have been an amazing crime thriller, one of the best in recent years while still being the good character study it is without a doubt. But all these references about conspiracy theories, hidden symbols and messages etc. add very little for me and I think this is also the kind of stuff that can only come from one writer, not a duo or so, who is in a perfect scenario also the director the way it is here, so he can get his vision 100% through. But maybe it worked better in his mind than in reality eventually. Like the best example is really the way Garfield's character makes the connection between the map in the comic book and the numbers or how he decrypts the message from the song. That just didn't feel right. Yes the main character is as intelligent as he is misguided, but still there's no way anybody could have made the connections Garfield's character comes up with here. Not over the course of a few months and certainly not within a few minutes like he does here. Quite a shame. The dog references, the skunk, the parrot (a lot about animals here), but also the rich society guy could have made for a quality crime thriller with interesting subplots for sure, but it does feel a bit shallow frequently and just not elaborated on as much as it could have been. Instead, the rich dead guy's daughter shows up constantly out of nowhere surprisingly. She also results in the motive the main character loves and loved already as a child. And while this could have been a truly defining moment of the film and certainly was intended to this way, it just did not work out. Not at all. Quite a pity. I think the vision and ideas were there without a doubt. But the execution just wasn't and eventually it turns into a film with all these metaphors and symbolisms, but very little under the surface and you cannot build a really good film on a loose foundation like this one.Finally a few words on individual scenes like the one at the end when our ""hero"" meets the cult. I liked that one actually. Even if the route leading up to this revelation did not feel right a lot of the time, it was an okay solution I suppose and the actors there were doing a fine job and the minimalistic camera work also was spot-on, which is a bit surprising as this is really when the film is at its best despite being at its most minimal. Now let me refer to my favorite scene here: That would easily be the one showing us a very special meeting between a song writer who owns a priceless Kurt Cobain guitar and the main character and what it turns into. It's never about the violence that comes from it, but all the song references there were pretty amazing and that scene may have been very much over the top, but it was fast, bold and just very impressive and as a consequence extremely memorable. Was it Jeremy Bobb? I am not sure really, it seemed to me like a cameo by a much more famous actor, but yeah if it was him, then good for him as he really stole the scene, if not the movie, with that performance regardless of how short it was. It was still very big. Okay I think that is all really. So overall, let me say it was a good film, but not a great one, not the great one it could have been all in all given the potential of the story. But it is still worth seeing, especially if you like Garfield as an actor. I give it a thumbs-up as a whole, but it should be nowhere near anybody's top-of-the-year lists.",Under the Silver Lake
1,nogodnomasters,Beware the dog killer,8,5 January 2019,"Sam (Andrew Garfield) lives in Hollywood for no particular reason or purpose. He is obsessed with a local author who writes a conspiracy book, ""Under the Silver Lake."" He believes in vast conspiracies including a nude owl woman succubus who seduces and kills people at night. The secret map in the cereal box is the key.Sam's mother loves Janet Gaynor and the 1927 version of ""Seventh Heaven."" Sam meets Sarah who loves ""How to Marry a Millionaire."" When Sarah disappears, Sam looks for her having to unravel coded messages in the songs by ""Jesus and his Brides."" ( A vampire music band.) There is a dog killer and a billionaire has also gone missing. There is more, but too much to mention.This is a clever piece of writing taking things that we know and creating coded messages in them. It reminded me of a number of ""B"" acid films, ""They Live"" and Peter Strzok who discovered secret coded messages in Russian spy picture sharing in ""Operation Ghost Stories.""Plenty of clues. Don't try too hard to understand the film, just enjoy it.Guide: F-word, sex, nudity (Wendy Vanden Heuvel, Riki Lindhome, Callie Hernandez (or body double) Stephanie Moore)",Under the Silver Lake
2,kosmasp,Diving,9,4 April 2019,"Some may feel like the title is misleading. Then again, what title would fit this movie? I didn't really think too much on that, since I quite liked the movie. Now I can understand what people don't like about it (it seems without a point or goal, main character is not that likeable, some may feel sexist tendencies poking through).If you can accept this as a movie that is all over the place, does not try to be political correct (quite the opposite) and tests the boundaries of storytelling and character arcs, you may find pleasure in watching this, just as I did. The things you don't find ethical, show that you are ""good"". Btw something the movie does comment on too. You may like that pragmatic touch or not, but it is there. And while you can also consider it a bit cliche, the way it is woven into the story makes it kind of unique.Again, this will not be something that will touch many people (as is evident by the rating already), but those who get behind it, will love it with all they have. You just have to find out on which side you are on",Under the Silver Lake
3,classicsoncall,"""Have you heard about these dog killers?""",6,10 September 2019,"What an exercise in pointless drivel. The entire film plays out like director and writer David Robert Mitchell's stream of consciousness musings on a variety of subjects that go nowhere. The only thing I could relate to, being this is an IMDb review site, and I'm a huge classic horror movie fan, were the iconic film posters in Sam's (Andrew Garfield) apartment. You had ""Psycho"", ""Dracula"", ""Rear Window"", ""The Wolf Man"", ""Creature From the Black Lagoon"", and ""Abbott and Costello Meet Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde"". Those were pretty cool, along with the brief clip of the 1956 flick, ""Invasion of the Body Snatchers"". If it weren't for those and other movie references like Sam's Mom's predilection for Janet Gaynor pictures and the Hitchcock tombstone, the entire effort would have been hopeless. Sam's pointless exercise in attempting to decipher meaningless hidden codes in treasure maps reminded me of M. Night Shyamalan's ""Lady in the Water"", a story that hinged on the placement of boxes of cereal in the protagonist's cupboard. Interestingly, a box of cereal figured in this misadventure too. It's one thing to be quirky like the Coen Brothers or even Tarantino, but at least their stories end up somewhere, even if you don't like the resolution. Here, nothing gets resolved, not the dog killer murders, the death of Jefferson Sevence, or those darned meaningless codes and clues. Neo-noir? Yeah, right, and if you buy that, open your next chess move with H6 to G4.",Under the Silver Lake

Thinking that living is now hopeless, Sam makes it his mission to search every corner of Los Angeles for his mystery woman.",Under the Silver Lake
5,CinemaSerf,A conspiracy: but of what and by whom is still a mystery!,6,13 August 2020,"I seem to recall that Andrew Garfield always used to bemoan his ""Spiderman"" days saying that most folks just wanted to admire his bum in his red and blue lycra. Well here, he (""Sam"") frequently dispenses with the costume entirely as he spends much of his time rather voyeuristically observing his female neighbours from the balcony of his apartment. Then he meets ""Sarah"" (Riley Keough) who, in the brief time they know each other, manages to intrigue him. This intrigue is only heightened when next day, she has moved out - and he determines to travel the length and breadth of Los Angles to track her down. His search introduces him all sorts of weird, drug-fuelled, spiritually challenging experiences, all loosely connected via a band and a mysterious dog killer. It's a curious watch, this - the narrative is all over the place, most of the time - so don't be looking for any consistent plot development; and the ending is about as inconclusive (without screaming sequel) as I think I've ever seen. That lack of structure is irritating, and though Garfield is really good at holding what there is together and his performance is up there with his ""Hacksaw Ridge"" (2016) effort, it's all just a bit too surreal for me and much as with ""Mulholland Drive"" (2001) I wasn't sure if the laugh was on me for watching and trying to make sense of what is, essentially, imponderable self-indulgence from David Robert Mitchell. Certainly worth a watch, but I am not sure I am any the wiser.",Under the Silver Lake
6,evanston_dad,Whacko Movie,7,6 September 2019,"I wish I had written a review of ""Under the Silver Lake"" immediately after watching it. As it is, I'm now trying to reconstruct the plot in my head and all I'm remembering is a mish-mosh jumble. Perhaps not a ringing endorsement of the film's ability to tell a story.I do remember liking this film as I was watching it. I read enough in advance to know what I was in for, so I didn't waste mental energy trying to figure everything out. I just relaxed into its whacko vibe and found myself fairly intrigued by where it was going to go next. I've seen the film compared to ""Donnie Darko"" and ""Southland Tales,"" both of which strike me as apt comparisons, though this isn't as good as either of those movies. It also conjures impressions of David Lynch, or an adaptation of something written by, say, Thomas Pynchon or David Foster Wallace. It's just bizarre, but in a pretty fun way. I'm not sure it has much to say, or at least, if it does, the director didn't do a very good job of saying it. But it's a fun ride nonetheless.Andrew Garfield is quite good as an unapologetically unlikable character. We all know someone like this guy -- a jerk who loafs around doing nothing but who somehow conveys that his lack of ambition to do anything other than watch T.V. and get stoned is everyone else's fault.Grade: A-",Under the Silver Lake
7,bombersflyup,"A puzzle, better left incomplete.",3,17 December 2018,"Under the Silver Lake is a mess of a film about nothing, that goes nowhere.A film of ideas thrown together, without practicality, form or purpose. It had potential, if the writer wasn't so twisted as to not have any sort of reasonable plot whatsoever. Andrew Garfield gives an empty performance, going through the motions. There are many characters with minor roles. Sam invests nothing in any of the these people, moving from one to the next. Leaving little room for them to make an impression, which none of them do. The ending's amateurish and inconclusive, making it a completely wasteful journey.",Under the Silver Lake
8,deloudelouvain,Didn't do it for me.,5,17 December 2018,"Weird is an understatement to describe Under The Silver Lake. I don't have anything against weird if it is a good story but in this case it just goes a bit too far for me. I'm not saying Under The Silver Lake wasn't interesting to watch, as I continued watching it because I wanted to know what the hell was going on, but in the end it's just too weird and most of the time it just didn't make any sense at all. The cinematography and the acting were okay though, so nothing bad to say about that. It's just that these kind of unlogical stories don't do it for me. Maybe for others it will but I have serious doubts there will be alot of amateurs for this kind of movie.",Under the Silver Lake
9,christopher-underwood,just enjoy the moments,8,14 February 2021,"There is much here to enjoy in this likeable neo-noirish/dreamlike offering from David Robert Mitchell. It looks good throughout, has plenty of surprises, some surreal touches and generally a good feeling. At some point after halfway in begins to dawn on the viewer that it is going to be some achievement to resolve all the various and varied elements that have unfolded. Unfortunately (or just maybe fortunately) this does not seem the intention of Mitchell and even more bizarre and unresolved issues are brought up in the file stages. It is perhaps advisable then to not go into this expecting the 'detective' to solve the mystery of the missing girl or the dead dogs or the fantastic caves or the secret code, but to just enjoy the moments.",Under the Silver Lake

12,UniqueParticle,Wonderful bizarre adventure,10,20 February 2020,I absolutely love the cinematography/style throughout! David Robert Mitchell makes such incredible and well written crafty films that tend to have a thought provoking substance to it. Even It Follows had stalkerish esq. so I appreciate the peculiar aspects in this. Under the Silver Lake reminds me a lot of They Live; so much brilliance I'll probably buy this when I get a chance!,Under the Silver Lake
13,Floated2,Quite different in mysterious style,7,16 August 2020,"Having heard very little about this film and but remembering its trailers, perhaps accidentally watched this film lesser on not so purpose.Now this film has the feel of a neo noir type independent and lesser Hollywood atmosphere, and for those reasons it works. The atmosphere is very subtle and mysterious and there are a few things along the way which keeps are interest.Unlike many films today, Under the silver lake is not so predictable which makes it a joy to watch. The runtime is quite length and at times may seem as if the film is about to end, then suddenly some other discovery occurs.Enjoyable film simply for the adventure we see the character of Andrew Garfield goes through. Although the ending was somewhat of a letdown.",Under the Silver Lake
14,eddie_baggins,A bizarre trip through the sun-bleached streets of LA,6,30 May 2019,"Not often do you finish a film and not know what on earth it was about but its the exact sentiment your likely to feel after watching David Robert Mitchell's Under the Silver Lake, a David Lynch like journey through the sun bleached surrounds of Los Angeles.A film that gives all new meaning to the term odd, Lake is certainly not the film you expect from Mitchell whose last film was the critically lauded horror It Follows, as we follow around Andrew Garfield's 30 something year old LA based slacker Sam, whose on a quest to uncover the reasoning behind Riley Keough's attractive acquaintance Sarah disappearance from his apartment complex.It doesn't sound like an overly complicated set-up but when Lake throws in a mysterious dog killer, a crazed songwriter, zany religious cults, a homeless king, a talking parrot and a dream like rock band, you quickly begin to realize that Lake is anything but a stereotypical narrative ride.At close to two and a half hours its also clear that Mitchell is in no rush to give answers to his audience as Sam's journey gets more and more bizarre, as he slowly but surely ebbs closer to uncovering the meaning behind Sarah's middle of the night disappearance.It's the type of product that's going to encourage a lot of audience disengagement, sleep and a reaching for the off button, a likely occurrence in the majority of instances but its also not hard to see Lake quickly become a cult favourite not dissimilar in tone and place to Donnie Darko.Mitchell has thrown in an abundance of hidden messages, metaphors and mysteries that instant fans of this work are going to lap up on repeat viewings for years to come but I cant help have the feeling that at the end of the day Lake feels like one big troll from the filmmaker, who seems on face value to be unearthing a deep and layered vision to be unwrapped by us viewers, only to gleefully be smiling down on us as it becomes more plausible that Lake is having at laugh at us with an expertly constructed plan.No matter your end feelings, Lake is a well shot, scored and acted piece, giving Garfield one of his more memorable big screen characters and for fans of films set around the sprawling heart of Hollywood, Lake offers a unique view of the city of stars.Final Say -A film that's just as likely about nothing as it is something, Under the Silver Lake won't be adored by most of its watchers but it's highly likely Mitchell's unique oddity becomes an instant cult hit in the film world, talked about and examined for year's yet to come.3 Spider-Man comics out of 5",Under the Silver Lake
15,arfdawg-1,Silver? It Doesn't Even Get the Bronze Medal,2,9 March 2019,"Lots of fake reviews compare this to David Lynch/Mullholland Drive. Well, it's set in LA. That's about where any comparison should end. The movie is a mess. All style. No substance.The story is not compelling in the slightest. I was way more bored than I was interested. And BTW, there is WAY too much emphasis on the sexual in this film. It really takes it down. It's as if the writer knew he was writing garbage and had to add some spice to get it made.What a bore",Under the Silver Lake
16,jadavix,Very good but too long,7,29 December 2018,"""Under the Silver Lake"" is a superbly strange, interesting, clever, witty kind of slacker suspense story which is undercut by the New Millennium Curse (NMC).You see, in the new millennium, almost all movies are cursed in the following way: they are too long. This is fatal to a thriller. The movie assembles its conspiracy with details that are too spaced out to be easily correlated in the viewer's mind, and thus, suspense does not build.However, there is a lot to like about the movie besides that. Andrew Garfield, particularly, is brilliant in the lead role.",Under the Silver Lake
17,CubsandCulture,"Just an empty film, lacks cohesion",6,23 June 2019,"This is my first real disappointment this year in film. There are just so many elements here that are fascinating and engaging. Garfield gives a scruffy understated performance that is very tragicomic. He is always wonderfully messed up and alienated that really the film might be at its best as a character study. Visually, the film is stylish and each frame chosen with care. The director allows each scene to have a fullness to it and while the overall narrative momentum each moment seems just right. The mystery never goes where you think it is going to go . It is very unfortunate then that the film comes to nothing.I believe the central flaw is it is not at all clear what Sarah means to Sam. At this film's core is a Neo-Noir missing person case. The various other elements are hanged on Sam trying to find Sarah. But there is just not an emotional connection to explain why he is looking for her and without that the film feels mechanical. In a similar vein all of the oddities of the plot (i.e. The Owl's Kiss) don't cohere into a theme or plot. I *think* the main character suffers from psychotic delusions but I am not sure where in the text I had that impression confirmed.Perhaps the film is meant to be surreal or dadaist in some way. If so I am not sure what the underlying mockery is aimed at. There are too many threads to pick at on that front, and in any case much of the film isn't funny. This film should have been better.",Under the Silver Lake

19,drownnnsoda,"A treat for film buffs and conspiracy connoisseurs, but that's about it",8,25 July 2019,"I am a major fan of David Robert Mitchell's last film, ""It Follows,"" which struck a fine balance between reality and the uncanny that we rarely see in films anymore. This film is less concerned with the uncanny (though it is still present to some degree) and more concerned with the paranoid, using popular conspiracy theories as plot devices that propel the lead character, Sam-a thirtysomething burnout-through a series of encounters and occurrences as he tries to find a woman who has abruptly vanished from his apartment building.The film has a languid tone and paints a vivid picture of Los Angeles, in the tradition of the great L.A.-set film noirs. It is also brimming with intertext, using dozens of tropes, images, and allusions to other films, which itself plays on the conspiracy angle through its repetition of popular cultural images. While the references are too many to count, the film reminded me most of Robert Aldrich's ""Kiss Me Deadly,"" another paranoid, off-kilter film noir set in Los Angeles; like in that film,the lead character of ""Under the Silver Lake"" moves from one bizarre situation to another while trying to uncover the fate of a woman he hardly knows.Because of the vast film history and tradition it draws on, ""Under the Silver Lake"" is a real treat for people who are film buffs, especially those who have an affinity for film noir. It will also appeal to a certain faction of millennial conspiracy theorists who adhere to the oft-repeated theories regarding the illuminati, Satanic messages on backward-spun vinyl, and the various ""codes"" that go unnoticed to all of us who are ""in the matrix.""While I enjoyed the film quite a bit, its one pitfall in my opinion was that it never quite manages to ramp up; where I expected there to be a fever pitch in the last act, the film instead unceremoniously plods along through the bizarre conclusion that rather loosely ties up the central mystery of the plot. That being said, there are a handful of weird and creepy moments throughout that somewhat off-set this lack of tension in the finale. All in all, the film is an enjoyable acid-trip journey through the L.A. underworlds of lore. 8/10.",Under the Silver Lake

21,questl-18592,Under the Bronze Lake,7,26 March 2021,"This was a weird movie. A really weird movie. So much symbolism and crazy without a ton of explanation for anything. I love all the metaphor in it but I do wish there was more of a coherent throughline. There feels like a great conversation here about our relationship with various forms of media and reality. Garfield gives a very solid performance and it's overall engaging but it feels a little off. It's so heavy on the metaphor that the actual relationships don't really track or make sense in a meaningful enough way. And because there's not enough basis in reality it's a little tough to keep track of what all is being said here. All that said, this is a great conversation movie. You're gonna wanna talk about this one when you finish it. I also think it completely warrants rewatching to try and capture more of the symbolism and idea that went into this, if you liked it of course. All that said, this doesn't feel like a great movie for the casual movie watcher, it's a little too off-filter and abstract. It is a great recommendation for the movie fans and cinephiles out there though and given that it's readily available on Amazon Prime, that makes it an easy call for most folks.",Under the Silver Lake
22,davidmvining,The good kind of messy,7,25 November 2019,"I have an affinity for movies that are really messy. Movies that spill over their sides with simply too much stuff, as long as the stuff is at least interesting and it can largely stick together. The one example that I can always call up of something like this is Gangs of New York. It does so much (not all of it that successfully), and ends up being really entertaining in the end.Well, Under the Silver Lake is of that same ilk. There are red herrings everywhere. The whole experience is designed to be discombobulating. And yet, there's a strikingly clear line through it. The movie isn't completely successful (not even as successful as Gangs of New York), but it ends up holding together well enough and is entertaining enough through its run time that I feel it falls just on this side of the recommendation line.Sam, played by Andrew Garfield, is an unemployed loser on the final few days of his grace period for unpaid rent. He seems completely unconcerned that he'll be homeless in less than a week. Instead, he spends his time spying on his female neighbors (ala Rear Window) and wasting time with a hipster friend who uses a drone to spy on women. When he meets a young, pretty, blonde and they hit it off, Sam seems to be coming out of his shell until she mysteriously disappears without a trace.He starts a search that leads around Hollywood, touching old lore, underground bunkers, and a series of obscure clues hidden throughout different points of popular culture. The efforts Sam goes through to discover these secrets seems absurd, but I think the movie ends up justifying it later.Now, I normally don't care about spoilers, but this movie is still rather new, so I'm going to actually include a spoiler warning, which is this very sentence. You're adults, I don't need to bold anything.It turns out that everything is a giant conspiracy amongst the elite powerbrokers (definitely in Hollywood, probably further reaching) to lay claim to some sort of eternal life. They enter these bunkers with six months of supplies, cut off internally sourced modes of communication, and fake their own deaths on the outside, with the expectation that they will transform to a new state of being. When this information is revealed almost two hours into the movie, the man speaking is a believer and speaks with religious conviction, but he also speaks of the process in religious terms.Combine that information with something that came earlier, a scene where Sam meets The Songwriter who's written every major hit for the past few decades and they all have hidden messages, and things begin to fit together. Yes, the elite could have found more efficient and less obtuse ways of communicating this information to each other, but the information itself wasn't the point. The point was the ritual, the quasi-religious process that got them to that point. Another element with The Songwriter is that he pokes fun at Sam for finding his rebellion through his music. The music wasn't meant for Sam, and it was all manufactured.At the heart of the film is the idea of meaning. Where do we derive meaning from? Well, for many people today, it's through popular culture, and yet it's almost all corporate product. It's a thin façade that insufficiently fills in the void of our lives for meaning. The elite in the movie have the same problem, and they've filled it with something more. They have a ritual that promises greater salvation. While the little people are enjoying the latest hit single from Jesus and the Brides of Dracula (or the action movies based on cleaning products, my favorite detail in the whole movie), the elite are discovering real meaning, a potential afterlife. In thinking of this, it's obvious that Sam seems to have gotten to the top, but he only really got his foot in the door before he got scared away and retreated back to what little life he has left.In the end, he does find the girl. Part of the quasi-religious process is that the elite man takes three young women to share the final six months with him. Sarah, the girl, is one of those three for the tycoon we've seen on television as recently decease through the whole movie. Her life was as empty as Sam's before hand, but there in that bunker (that she can't escape), she has something. She takes it in stride and says that she'll make the most of it. Sam is a bit flabbergasted and has no other choice but to come to terms with it before knocking on the older woman's door next to his apartment and getting invited in.I think that core of the film is really interesting, but it's a bit messy and there are red herrings. The title itself is a good title, but ultimately has little bearing on the action. The movie opens with the idea of a dog killer that gets directly addressed in a comic of Hollywood history, but seems to have nothing to do with the movie itself (yes, there is an implicit possibility that Sam is the dog killer, but that feels both thin and ultimately incidental to both the action and his character which is a weird thing to say).However, part of the movie's appeal is its messy nature. I'm not sure tightening it up and clearing some of the extra stuff out would be completely positive to the movie's experience. The journey would feel more predictable and straighter, which wouldn't help the movie, I don't think. In the end, I appreciate the movie's messiness and find what's there to be quite engaging. It's not great, but definitely worth a watch.",Under the Silver Lake

What I find particularly upsetting is first Andrew Garfield is totally under-utilised and secondly he agreed to do this movie, he must have read the script. He maybe thought this might be a vehicle to confound his Spider-Man image in the state, however there was no need he has high quality work before Spider-Man and Andrew is no Tobey Maguire, he is never in fear of being typecast.What was good:1, the atmosphere was comprehensively established2, the acting what we saw of it was good.3, the music and the cinematographyWhat was appalling:1, the script had no narrative drive it was just tedious.2, there was little story to sustain a movie and what there was was cryptic and shallow3, there was insufficient character development for us to have any sympathy for what happened.4, far too much was left hanging with no redemption or resolution what the hell was that all about.Overall this movie was one off a glorified turkey, had it not been for Andrew Garfield this movie would never have reached the silver screen and been dumped in the Silverlake",Under the Silver Lake
26,muamba_eats_toast,What an earth happened?,3,21 March 2019,I spent most of the film wondering what the hell I was watching and where it could all have gone so wrong I enjoyed it follows and Andrew Garfield is by far my favourite actor so it should have been a match made in heaven for me but it's just a pure mess. It took me an hour to get past how annoying the soundtrack was. There is tits for tits sake every few seconds and I genuinely considered giving this a 1 for a while but there was the odd scene I enjoyed such as with the aongwriter on the piano. However it can't be seen as anything other than a mess overall. Another case of what could have been a real wast of Garfield's talent.,Under the Silver Lake

29,aciessi,What is Under the Silver Lake?,6,8 December 2020,"David Robert Mitchell clearly watched Mulholland Drive and Inherent Vice back to back and said to himself ""I want to make these exact movies."". Under the Silver Lake is a druggy, LA based, neo-noir. It's main protagonist is a slacker who tries to crack the code of a high profile murder mystery and stumbles every step of the way. He's the millennial Doc Sportello. Yet, Inherent Vice's vision of LA is far more fitting of its narrative than that of Under the Silver Lake. Also, without the unpredictably bizarre nature of David Lynch's Mulholland Drive, modern day LA seems less interesting. DRM can't seem to grasp what made those films so fascinating and unforgettable. He's got the style and rhythm, but not the whole picture. But it's not as empty as some have made this film out to be. When it really goes out of its way, Under the Silver Lake is fun to watch and downright brilliant. The ancient songwriter who wrote every popular song known to man was by far my favorite wacky plot point here. The ending is so dreadfully anti-climatic. All that time building and building, to ultimately lead to nothing, is unforgivable. For that, I can't say that Under the Silver Lake is a good movie.",Under the Silver Lake
30,rockman182,Under The Silver Lake (2018),7,9 December 2018,"It Follows was a film that I truly loved for its substance, style, score, and themes. It was a really good work and showed that horror films could be intensely entertaining without the jump scares. We were all awaiting what David Robert Mitchell would do next. The trailer for Under The Silver Lake looked good, like a neo-noir that would be stylish and memorable. The film's release kept getting pushed back and now we have a 2019 release. After watching I'll say the film has its moments and is nice to look at as it captures that chill California feel. Unfortunately, it doesn't compare to the innovation that It Follows delivered.The film is about a young slacker who notices that he has a beautiful neighbor. He spends a night bonding with her and then finds out that she has disappeared without a trace. He finds clues that lead him to various parties and events all around town and then starts to realize that the circumstances of her disappearance are deeper than he had originally thought they were. The film stars Andrew Garfield and Riley Keough.You can see the presence of David Robert Mitchell. The film is nice and bright and uses its atmosphere and location to set its mood. As a neo noir set in modern day Los Angeles the film looks the part and has the beautiful people and sex to go with it. The film does suffer from being a bit too long and slow with the next passage not being as interesting as the last. Its by no means a bad film it just doesn't capitalize on the precedent set by It Follows.Maybe the film needed a bit of Maika Monroe, it just felt like there was something missing from this film to make it something special. I'm still excited to see what Mitchell comes up with next but maybe he should go back to what he accomplished with It Follows rather than a meandering noir that doesn't always work. It has the look and feel but needs work to be truly special.6.5/10",Under the Silver Lake

He discovers codes in popular songs and searches for the songwriter. He finds him in a huge mansion behind a tall wall. The songwriter plays the piano and says he has written generations of music all the way back to Beethoven. This infuriates Garfield, because the songwriter symbolizes one giant muse that inspires all writers and Garfield wants answers instead of more riddles. The bracelet from a girl who dies in the LA reservoir (Silver Lake) leads him to a cave where three women and one man know the girl. They call her in the ascension chamber. She can't get out and accepts her fate. Garfield goes back to his apartment and lives with the bird-cage girl. This film is very interesting, because it is visually exciting. The script is scintillating, then profound. This might be something greater than itself. Garfield is impervious to the ordinary. He wants answers.

We are so much more vulnerable to our fears.Los Angeles is wacky enough on the surface, but when Sam falls for a mysterious woman in his apartment complex he is immersed in a higher level of weird. His new crush disappears as suddenly as she appeared, so Sam investigates and discovers secrets, crimes, and subliminal messages on a wider scale. His quest to find the girl triggers something deep inside him and parallels a growing awareness that things he hoped for and dreamed about are merely fabrications. He tries to make the best of things despite a failure to control his impulses.This vibrant, strange, raw, Cannes festival film is a quirky, fun, and well-written meditation on living. It has a graphic novel and Southern California vibe. Under the Silver Lake takes us beneath the surface in more ways than one; under the water, tunnels beneath Hollywood, escorts and underwear, independent filmmaking, the underpinnings of music and hobo culture, drones revealing secrets from the sky, and more. This implausible, impossible, emotional, and awkward film is revealing and enthralling. ""Crazy makes for good sex,"" and good filmmaking. The message is that we need to make the best of life and surround ourselves with light, beauty, mystery, and laughter, for there is just a tiny window where we can have fun.",Under the Silver Lake
35,apryla-58795,Life is meaningless...then you die,5,30 August 2019,"This movie had me so engrossed I couldn't look away or stop watching even for a bathroom break. I kept waiting for the payoff but there was none and I'm guessing that was the point? Life is just a bunch of random events where we cross paths with others and eat, drink, party, have relations and relationships (some last-most don't). Some people accept this and others can't and must search for meaning like Sam. I don't think we need a movie to show us what we already know.It seems like some of the things that happened were imagined because they just don't make sense. He did smoke pot so maybe he was just hallucinating or having vidid dreams.The one scene with Riley Keough in the bunker talking by videophone with Sam kind of resonated with me. She asks him if he thinks she made a mistake and he says maybe to which she says that she has to make the best of it as there's nothing that can be done now. That is what many of us do when faced with tough situations-we just resign ourselves. I think when you realize life is truly meaningless and get over that hopeless feeling then you can kind of say ok that sucks but I gotta make the best of it cause what's the alternative?Also we are manipulated at every turn by media but unless you hide away in a bunker you can't escape that.I don't know who was killing the dogs (maybe Sam due to his rejection by the girl on the billboard). I don't know if Owl girl is real. I don't know who the dark figure in the park was. I don't know who was shooting at them in the reservoir and not sure why Sam didn't report the girl who got killed to the police. I don't know the significance of the mom calling and how the Gaynor actress fit in with the movie. I don't know why Sam would sleep with the older woman with the birds. I don't know why this movie was so bizarre and made no sense but there's nothing that can be done about it now so I guess I just have to resign myself to the fact that I won't understand it and I just wasted about two long hours doing so.This movie is forgettable and it hardly made any money. The writer and director overlooked the fact that we have been programmed and manipulated to not think very much so therefore his movie would not be well received. I mean ok great he made a point but he also did not make any money. If this was an experiment I hope he's happy with the results because he can't be happy with the returns.I wouldn't advise this unless you are someone who doesn't like their movies tied up neatly.",Under the Silver Lake

38,johannes2000-1,"Different, original and inventive, with a great Andrew Garfield!",9,19 September 2018,"This movie will definitely not be everyones cup of tea. Words like weird and bizarre are rightly used in the reviews here, but words like original, inventive and fascinating are just as appropriate. One of the reviewers referred to ""Mulholland Drive"", and I myself had to think of ""Kaboom"" by Gregg Arakis, where Thomas Dekker finds himself in a similar mind-boggling conspiracy-like situation as Andrew Garfield. Anyway: I was thrilled and very much entertained and I loved it!Sure, there are some things to say against it. The movie is really over-long (way over 2 hours!), it could have used some sharper editing. The mixture of realistic and unrealistic (supernatural??) goings-on is mostly functional, but at (many) other times so confusing that you risk loosing your grip, and with that your positive feelings for the story, thanks to moments of just too much weirdness (like the scenes with the homeless king).But oh boy, there is SO much to like! The wonderful photography. The script. The intelligent direction, with many surprising, unusual camera-angles and a daring but always functional use of sex and nudity. The subtle, tongue-in-cheek humor. The consistent and convincing use of the film-noir style. And of course Andrew Garfield. He is absolutely great as the good-for-nothing, egotistical and sex-craving youngster who turns into a hero in spite of himself when he more and more tries to find answers to the mysteries with which he's confronted. It's no more the endearing, athletic Spiderman we see, but an everyday thirty-something guy who stumbles through life, with ruffled hair and a constant baffled look. Endearing in an entirely different way, I would say.So I dare you to go and see for yourself: it's maybe not easy but still a feast for the eyes and the mind. I rank it a heartfelt 9 out of 10.",Under the Silver Lake
39,ronakkotian,A misunderstood gem,9,12 May 2020,"WARNING: *SPOILERS*This is by far one of the weirdest films I've come across. It's understandable why people and critics hated this movie but I loved it all the way through.Under the Silver Lake follows Sam, a man living in LA who meets this new girl living near his apartment. A day after meeting her she disappears, leading Sam on a quest to find her and manages to uncover many secrets and conspiracies along the way.I love films that breaks the regular genre conventions and aims to be different than the rest. Under the Silver Lake is a prime example of this. This seems like a standard mystery film but the way director David Robert Mitchell helms this is totally different from any other mystery film out there. His previous film It Follows was also very confusing to general audience members but Mitchell becomes extremely bold here. The camerawork and music are brilliantly done and having the audience travel with Sam to different locations whilst meeting different people made the film really fun to watch. The humour was great and the whole noir style was entertaining. Andrew Garfield is phenomenal as Sam and Riley Keough does well for the short time she's in it.I can fully understand how polarizing this film may be to audiences as it provides more questions than answers. The mystery of the Dog Killer and the Owl's Kiss are examples of questions that don't have answers and the ending will infuriate a lot of people because of how underwhelming it is but that's the point of the film. Mitchell subtly shows us how we, like Sam, try to find meaning in things are essentially meaningless. There doesn't have to be an explanation to everything. People will also complain about how sexualized women are throughout and say the film's sexist when it's clearly not. The film is commentating on how Hollywood exploits women and how they're being used for others' pleasure.Under the Silver Lake is one of the most unique films I've seen and I'll definitely look forward to David Robert Mitchell's future work. This is a film that I believe people should watch multiple times as it helps get a better understanding of the film's themes and purpose. After watching it a few times it's insane to see how many details Mitchell has hidden within each frame. It shows his creativity as a writer and director. This won't be to everyone's liking but I think people should give it a shot and see which side they fall under.",Under the Silver Lake
40,PyroSikTh,A Movie of Questions Intentionally with No Answers,7,24 December 2019,"Andrew Garfield is Sam, a slob with a surprising knack with women, who becomes obsessed with the disappearance of one woman in particular. A disappearing woman in LA is not all that surprising, but after morse code in random fireworks, a complete cleanout of her apartment, a strange hobo symbol, and a similar-looking girl picking up the last remnants of her stuff before going on a magical mystery tour of LA certainly does raise a few questions. The deeper Sam goes in his investigation, the weirder things get, including a man who calls himself the Homeless King, a creature called the Owl's Kiss who kills men in the dead of night, and a mysterious Songwriter living in a grand mansion in a gated community.Everything connects up in bizarre and surprising ways, ultimately leading Sam to his answer of what happened to the girl, and yet many of the clues remain unanswered or are left as pointless leads that go nowhere. This is potentially where the movie becomes infuriating, especially for those seeking answers, and for me personally I'm still torn on this part. I spent much of the movie picking up tiny little clues which amounted to nothing, which felt unsatisfactory, but also felt fitting for the themes of the movie about conspiracies and pop culture.But honestly my favourite thing about this movie has been reading up on what everyone else thinks it's about. One theory suggests Sam is a Paranoid Schizophrenic, and we're viewing everything from his skewed viewpoint. Some things are real, some things imagined, but most lies in a grey area between. Another theory is that the whole movie is a metaphor for getting over a break-up. Another example is the prevailing existence of the Dog Killer, which is often brought up, but never developed or answered. Some suggest Sam is the Dog Killer, some suggest Sam's Ex is the Dog Killer in a figurative sense, and some suggest the entire role of the Dog Killer is symbolic for the treatment of women in Hollywood. But the best part is that all of these theories could be right. There's so much evidence to support all of them, and yet barely any contradictions or clues that lead to something different. It's a movie deliberately written without one answer, but with many. Some call this lazy writing by not offering any concrete answers, but I can only see it as an example of genius writing by allowing the viewer to take from the movie whatever they see and interpret from it.Linked to this is how the movie is quite clearly a puzzle in itself, and many people have actually approached the movie as something to be solved. Hidden codes open up new possibilities and create too many coincidences to be accidental. It's also suspicious that a renowned codebreaker - Kevin Knight - is listed as a consultant on the movie. But what I love about this is that the movie becomes what it's criticising. It becomes a piece of pop culture for people to obsess over and find hidden meanings in. And part of me hopes there is no hidden meaning, because that's the point. By the end of the film Sam manages to break free of his obsession with answers. He asks the old lady what her parrot has been saying all this time, she says she doesn't know, and he accepts that as the ultimate truth, as a new mystery that will never be solved because there is no answer.But beyond that the film has a number of exceptional individual moments that were a joy to watch no matter how disconnected they were to the main mystery. Sam finds himself paling up with the writer of an urban myth comic, who obsesses over things just as much as Sam, leading him on the path of the Dog Killer and the Owl's Kiss. This is all an irrelevant sub-plot to the missing girl, but the Owl's Kiss is David Robert Mitchell's chance to go back to what he proved he can do well in It Follows. She's a creepy creature that lends itself to the movie creepiest and most unsettling moments, and I lapped them up. Another great scene is Sam's confrontation with the Songwriter, as he dispels Sam's obsession with pop culture, all the while playing a number of famous songs on his piano, from Jump by Van Halen to I Want It That Way by Backstreet Boys, from Smells Like Teen Spirit by Nirvana to the Cheers theme music, from Where Is My Mind by The Pixies to Crazy Train by Ozzy Osbourne. It becomes as fascinating as it is hilarious as it is disturbing.On a more technical basis, Under the Silver Lake has a very similar feel to It Follows. The time period feels vague thanks a myriad of retro items, from the NES to Playboy magazines to candlestick telephones. The use of lighting is soft and deliberate, creating shadows in unnerving places in some scenes, and just being a pleasant visual to bathe in in others. The score by Disasterpiece evokes the kind of music you'd hear in a 1950's noir film, often fitting, but sometimes jarring and uncomfortable. The use of painted backdrops also evokes those classic movies, like the moon and clouds over the reservoir, or the path up to the Songwriter's mansion in the background.There's a lot of recurring motifs that could mean everything or nothing, such as three women (in the apartment, in the burning car, stood around the Dog Killer sign, in the movie they watch, in Sarah's dolls, in the band Jesus and the Brides of Dracula, in the hookers who help Sam find the Songwriter, in the bathroom barking at him, and almost always a blonde, brunette, and redhead), the front cover of the Playboy magazine, the girl on the billboard, the Dog Killer. Not to mention the recreations of famous scenes from classic movies, like Marilyn Monroe's last ever movie before her death, Sam sat on his balcony like he's in Rear Window, or the underground shelters reminiscent of the final moments of 2001.Under the Silver Lake feels like a meticulously crafted and very deliberate movie, while at the same time feeling a little messy and directionless. The surreality of Sam's journey through LA is enough to keep you from getting bored as a viewer, and if you get invested enough to try and stitch everything together you'll have to get used to the idea that the journey is better than the answers at the end. The movie has points it wants to make about pop culture, and becomes a victim of them itself in order to get this point across, from the puzzles embedded for the audience to the misogynistic treatment of its female characters. It's a hard movie to get into, but an equally hard movie to get out of. It grabs you and has you doing mental gymnastics long after it's finished as you try and work out exactly what you've just seen. Oh and Andrew Garfield is fantastic as the misogynistic, violent, obsessive, creepy, lazy, self-entitled main character. I'm definitely looking forward to David Robert Mitchell's next movie. I give Under the Silver Lake a solid 7/10.",Under the Silver Lake

44,Stay_away_from_the_Metropol,If Mulholland Drive were written by a 9th grader,5,5 December 2018,"Let me preface this by saying I was very excited for this movie. I'm into mysteries, I'm into noir, I'm into giallo, I'm into people making things that are ambitious and unpredictable, I'm a sucker for Riley Keough, and I was a pretty big fan of IT FOLLOWS. But, I never could have imagined this...With this film, David Robert Mitchell has basically solidified his position as the world's new Richard Kelly. IT FOLLOWS was his DONNIE DARKO, and THIS is his SOUTHLAND TALES. Southland Tales is the ONLY movie that I find this truly comparable to.First, it's strengths: it is astronomically ambitious, unpredictable, and it will go WAY out of it's way to try to be weird. You have to give anyone who is willing to go THAT FAR out on a limb a little bit of credit. But, aside from that, the casting of a few extremely good looking people, and the desire you'll probably feel to continue observing this 2 hour and 20 minute freakshow just to see if the train wreck can get any uglier, the positives end there.Now, let's just talk about the most painful parts: Garfield's character is impossible to take seriously the majority of the time. His portrayal of a smelly (people bring up how horrible he smells literally every 5 minutes throughout the film) timid weirdo is awkward in the wrong way - reminds me of Bradley Cooper in Silver Linings Playbook - you're trying to be a weirdo but it's not working - I see acting, I see trying. Then, he transforms into the Terminator in some really out-of-place sequences that would be really cool if they didn't make such little sense in their placement. Second, this is a movie about Los Angeles that feels like it was made by someone who only knows as much as tourists know about Los Angeles. The locations are all the most cliche L.A. staples, which serve their purpose, but the majority of the characters feel like ignorant caricatures of what outsiders think L.A. people are like: yoga hippies, music producers, prostitutes, but all depthless interpretations with no inspiration - there is one specific ""L.A. party"" sequence on a downtown rooftop full of bland L.A. actors trying to portray eccentric L.A. people and it's so off base it feels like a rejected Target commercial.It's clear that this movie wants to be Mulholland Drive, but it lacks the conceptual focus, the effective dreamlike surrealism, and the palpable creativity that make that film so masterful. The ""homeless king"" clearly wishes he was ""the mysterious cowboy"", but he's not - his crown looks way too cheap. Under The Silver Lake is full of ""totally random"" characters, scenarios, and cryptic ""clues"" that eventually tie into EACH OTHER, but still leave you feeling like they all served no plausible purpose in the end, like connecting a bunch of effects pedals with coupler cables but then having no batteries or AC adapter to power them up with.",Under the Silver Lake

It's about embracing each moment of your life as an adventure of discovery and in the end accepting where we are and what life is and maybe getting a dog when it all feels like a bit much...It is a delusional idea, in my opinion to hope for a perfect world beyond this one, simply because we are incapable of creating that while we are alive... it is a spiritual emptiness looking to be filled... something to hope for by the weak and unempowered, the downtrodden... we are not a society of spiritual encouragement but of material preoccupation...So you see, Under the Silver Lake is anything but pointless.When you can only see the world of man, it is easy to see how you could become neurotic, that is why you must always maintain a healthy relationship with the earth, with your own existence, and being a beacon of compassion and kindness for others.The message of the movie may be: Be in tune, follow your heart, delusion or not, it'll all work out... after all, the other choice perhaps is only madness, sorrow and death.",Under the Silver Lake

6. The scene between Songwriter (Jeremy Bobb) and Sam is utterly mesmerising with the intense monologue and piano playing by Songwriter that culminates in a brutally gory ending.Cons:
1. The plot is incoherent, and at times it feels as if it's jumping from one to another with no structure.
2. There are a couple pointless characters. For example, the character of Bar Buddy (Topher Grace) who just seems to needlessly play the cliche weed-smoking pseudo-intellectual.
3. There is far too much pretentious symbolism which distracts away from the plot.
4. The character of Sam is mostly bland and uninteresting.
5. The ending is rather anti-climactic as it falls rather flat.",Under the Silver Lake
49,youngcollind,Hollywood Surrealist Maze,8,5 May 2021,"This movie wins points right out the gate for how odd everything is, but also manages to make a few clever points about about the hollow entertainment industry and the futility of existence. It's strengths become it's weakness' mid way when it's lack of traditional narrative start to become a bit grating. After a while, it just feels like watching this slacker bumble from one insane situation to another with no real stakes for any of it. Nonetheless, much of the weirdness is very enjoyable, it's depth is not overlooked, and it's hard not to be at least a little impressed by a movie this bizarre.",Under the Silver Lake
50,bastos,Very bizarre and divise but worth the watch,7,13 March 2021,"This movie reminds me a lot of Southland Tales. They're both follow-ups to hugely popular genre movies where the director got a bigger budget and was allowed a lot of freedom to create a very bizarre movie that ended up being dismissed by critics but loved by some fans. I do think Under the Silver Lake is a much better movie than Southland Tales, but the similarities are striking. As I get older I become more and more jaded towards movies (as most people do) because we stop being surprised as we've seen almost everything and movies are usually a rehash of some other work that we've inevitably seen before so it gets harder and harder to be surprised by them. That's why I value originality over almost everything else when analyzing a movie. But it's a tightrope to walk on because I also like my movies to be comprehensible and if you go too off course it becomes a pretentious piece that only the director can enjoy. I think this movie pulls it off quite well. A very original and bizarre story that has a satisfying conclusion and can be interpreted without much work. It is a bit unbalanced and some parts work better than others, but overall I really enjoyed this noirish trip into the underworld of Los Angeles.",Under the Silver Lake
51,TheVictoriousV,Those who end up liking it will REALLY like it.,9,17 January 2019,"Finally released in my neck of the woods, A24's Under the Silver Lake starts off 2019 with a bang; an effortful, labyrinthine, and transporting treat for all human senses. Its colors exquisite, its music delightfully old-school, and its story wonderfully bizarre and original, I've a feeling I already have one of my entries on my 2019 list set.It starts with the young and aimless L.A. resident Sam (Andrew Garfield), who sees a mysterious woman played by Riley Keough at the apartment complex swimming pool. Although he finds a friend and maybe a lover in the woman, he later finds that she's disappeared without trace alongside her flatmates. Wanting to get to the bottom of this sudden departure, Sam finds out more than he expected, including the woman's connection with the death of a local millionaire, a recent series of dog killings, a peculiar indie band called Jesus & The Brides of Dracula, a ""Homeless King"", and other things that seem to eerily correspond with the plot of a zine he's been reading.The side characters are many but they all leave an impression. We meet the adorable but strange Balloon Girl (Grace van Patten, niece of Dick), an actress known as The Actress (Riki Lindhome), Sam's conspiracy nut friend (Patrick Fischler), another friend (Jimmi Simpson) with his head oft in the clouds, a hipster friend known simply as Man at Bar (Topher Grace), and many more. Some are given cameos before they become important to Sam's quest but they remain entertaining throughout.The director is David Robert Mitchell of It Follows and the composer is Disasterpiece, who provided the Carpenter-inspired synths for that very same film (I recall not being too hot on his music in that film but I've changed my mind). Like It Follows, this movie has an old-fashioned feel, albeit in its own ways.Characters in the film prefer to hear their music on vinyl, play their games on a Nintendo Entertainment System, and get their porn from Playboy. Someone categorized this film as ""hipster noir"" and I can sort of see why.This is an especially great film if you're into mysteries, urban legends, and conspiracy theories. It touches on everything from creatures said to lurk around Los Angeles at night, to secret shelters, to messages hidden within our music, to the idea that all of said music - whether it is rebellious or conformist, regardless of generation - was all masterminded by one person to shape our culture. On top of that is the directing and camera work; the clever, often Wes Anderson-like compositions as well as the long takes that involve many actors, extras and locations at once.Under the Silver Lake is mystifying, to be sure, and some may be disappointed at its lack of answers. However, it is an original (yet classical) and at times mind-blowing film, even to those who aren't exactly conspiracy theorists. Those who end up liking it, as per my estimation, will end up REALLY liking it.",Under the Silver Lake
52,quaseprovisorio,I hope this will get cult status because it deserves it. I think the end does deliver.,9,8 March 2020,"This movie is great. I just finished it now, so it still has to stick in my mind. However it's full of layers and layers, what might upset the viewer if he/she is expecting a standard thriller/conspirational film. This is none of them, also because of the surrealism it adds, when the protagonist just goes with half pijamas to an upscale party (don't think it's actually a major spoiler lol), or simply has access to things that can't come as real. it has a lynch vibe that actually delivers.However all the symbology, the conspiration tone, how the story develops and actually reveals, a place where the middle class no longer belongs and the rich and powerful can do pretty much everything. Sam has everything going against him: he is a faded actor that doesn't know what to do to his life, he's going to be evicted from his house, his mom has no idea of what's going on and he sees a beautiful girl hanging around a swimming pool. The beggining of the movie gives you clues until its end, and i do think everything makes sense, mostly from the pop culture references you see throghout it. it might seem weird to see how easily sam has access to this type of society, but in a way everyone is pretending, and everyone needs to keep pretending in order to get small crumbs of the cake.He is losing, and everyone in the world is pretty much losing too: we've been told time and time again that the system doesn't fail us. we fail the system. Movies and pop culture tells us that we all gonna be rockstars and actors some day, and get the most beautiful ladies(at least to men)...and sam literally kills that voice, even though he's still a victim - or had given up - of how the things are. That's why he takes so personally this case and goes after the mistery, searching for cues in the most unexpected places.I didn't want to give up much anything. i do think sam could be richer in terms of character, and not just wandering around los angeles, but at the same time being passive is important for the character. Some stuff might not add up totally, because of the surralistic tone, but hey it's been give since the beggining. the film is coherent on that. plus it has a lot of references, great music and is very well filmed, with a great cinematography too.I understand why it wasn't a hit. some movies aren't. However, like the big lebowski or donnie darko this movie has everything to become a cult sensation. It has a huge charm into it, and it actually has an ending that makes sense. I was not expecting that to be honest. I really liked it.",Under the Silver Lake
53,tfminfl,I love mind bendy movies,10,4 April 2020,"417. Under the Silver Lake. A pretty wild mind bender, head scratcher, what the fruit loops just happened good time! A great recommendation from the Movie Ninja, thank you. We meet Sam, he's kind of a slacker, and about to be evicted from his pad, but he is dating a very nice prostitute. One day hanging out on his patio, he spies a beauty, Sarah, chilling by the pool, and meets her later on while hanging around her dog. And after fun night of chilling, poof, she disappears. And Sam apparently really felt a connection with Sarah over those 2 or 3 hours because this dude goes on a hunt for this girl. Through a crazy couple of dreamlike days we follow Sam through some insane conspiracy theories that lead him through a hobo underground, complete with its own king (Fisher King?) secret sex drug parties, getting crazy to a Brimful of Asha (Everybody needs a bosom for a pillow) and of course the billionaire cults preparing for the afterlife. Think Alfred Hitchcock, Brian DePalma and Stanley Kubrick got together for a movie, and it turned out pretty sweet! Starring a former Spider-Man and a former Venom (didn't recognize him at first, Foreskin is all grown up) But yea, I really liked it, gets pretty crazy!! Check it out!",Under the Silver Lake
54,Bertaut,"Just like Mulholland Drive. Except really, really, really awful",3,26 March 2019,"Under the Silver Lake is a pretentious, self-indulgent, convoluted, overlong mess. Positioning itself as equal parts neo-noir and genre subversion, it is essentially a cross between David Lynch's Mulholland Dr. (2001) and Thomas Pynchon's Inherent Vice (2009). With the major difference being that it's absolutely, unrelentingly terrible. As with Mitchell's previous films, Silver Lake works as both an example and a subversion of genre - it's a mystery noir à la Kiss Me Deadly (1955), The Long Goodbye (1973), and Chinatown (1974), but is also at pains to undermine and critique many of the generic markers found in such films. A 140-minute labyrinthine, paranoia-laden shaggy-dog story full of MacGuffins, false leads, narrative dead ends, and unexplained details, the film relocates the detective stories of Raymond Chandler and Dashiell Hammett to the chaotic postmodern era of cognitive semiotics where the relationship between signifier and signified is now so arbitrary that meaning-making itself has become a protean commodity. However, it is easily the most self-important piece of garbage I've seen in a long time; a philosophically juvenile rumination thoroughly convinced of its own portentousness. Fundamentally misogynistic, it's at least 45 minutes too long, with an unfocused narrative, poorly thought-out metaphors, and an insipid protagonist. The cinematography is pretty though.Set in contemporary LA, Under the Silver Lake follows Sam (Andrew Garfield), a 33-year-old man-child with no job, no ambition, and no direction, whose day consists of sitting on his balcony watching his neighbour (Wendy Vanden Heuvel) parade around topless, having unfulfilling NSA sex with a friend-with-benefits (Riki Lindhome), and visiting his drinking buddy (Topher Grace) to use a drone to spy on women (it should tell you a bunch about the film that none of these three characters are even assigned a name). Out of the blue, he meets and instantly falls in love with Sarah (Riley Keough), but when he visits her apartment the day after meeting her, he finds her gone and the apartment empty, apart from a shoebox with a photograph and a few trinkets, and a strange symbol painted on the wall. Although he later identifies Sarah as one of three women killed in a car crash alongside billionaire media mogul (and professional stuntman) Jefferson Sevence (Chris Gann), having recognised a hat found at the scene to be hers, he refuses to believe she's dead. And so begins an odyssey to track her down that ultimately involves, amongst other things, a hipster pirate, secret codes hidden in everyday objects, a glam rock band named Jesus and the Brides of Dracula, a dog murderer, a conspiracy theorist comic book writer (Patrick Fischler), the Hobo Code, a vast network of underground tunnels, an actual literal homeless king (David Yow), a helpful coyote, an unhelpful skunk, an escort agency staffed by former child-stars, a balloon dancer (Grace Van Patten), a walled-off Xanadu-like mansion, a mysterious songwriter (Jeremy Bobb) with a strange claim, a female serial killer who enters men's apartments wearing nothing but an owl mask, and a New Age cult lead by super-wealthy men.Perhaps the most immediately obvious aspects of Silver Lake is the sheer range of homages that Mitchell includes at both plot and structural levels. Some of these homages are impressively handled, some not so much. Disasterpeace's score, for example, and Mike Gioulakis's cinematography are both extremely retro, serving to situate the film firmly in the formal styles of yesterday. Vreeland's score (although I didn't like it in and of itself) is a solid imitation of the work of composers such as Franz Waxman and Bernard Herrmann, whilst Gioulakis's photography, with its overly dramatic camera movements and crash zooms that seem to come out of nowhere, recalls the work of Robert Burks and Sam Leavitt.Most of the other homages come at plot level, and although some are well integrated into the narrative, many feel shoehorned in, as if Mitchell is showing off his range of reference, so much so that the film essentially becomes pastiche. Examples include Sam's mother's obsession with Janet Gaynor; Sam sitting on his balcony using binoculars to spy on people, á la L.B. Jefferies (James Stewart) from Rear Window (1954); Sam and Sarah watching How to Marry a Millionaire (1953); a brief glimpse of an Amazing Spider-Man comic (intertextual and self-reflexive, given Garfield's appearance as the titular character in two films); a visual quotation of Marilyn Monroe in a swimming pool from the unfinished film, Something's Got to Give; the Brides of Dracula doing a cover of Lulu's ""To Sir with Love"" from the film of the same name; a visit to Griffith Observatory from Rebel Without a Cause (1955); a very on-the-nose shot of a gravestone with the word ""Hitchcock"" on it; and a scene that references songs as varied as ""I Love Rock 'n' Roll"", ""Where Everybody Knows Your Name"", ""I Want to Know What Love Is"", ""Smells Like Teen Spirit"", and ""I Want it That Way"". The most consistent referential touchstone, however, is David Lynch, particularly Mulholland Drive, an infinitely superior mystery thriller also set in the darker environs of LA involving a sprawling cast of strange characters.Thematically, the film is all over the place, never settling on any one issue, instead jumping around like a hyperactive puppy trying to be in eight different places at once. Characters say things such as ""who isn't being followed these days?"" and ""the ideology you thought you adopted through free will was actually subliminal messaging"", but it's all meaningless in a narrative chaos where nothing is ever examined for more than a couple of minutes. Positing that pop culture has profound hidden meaning (in direct contrast to most cultural-anthropological thinking), the film is so imprecise and scattered that it's impossible to tell if Mitchell actually buys into the notion that schizophrenic conspiracies are all around us or if he's being facetious.And yes, I understand what he's doing - presenting the film from the point of view of a pop culture-saturated Millennial who's easily distracted and hence keeps losing the run of his own story. However, Oliver Stone did a far better job of depicting a similarly media-soaked shortened-attention span over 20 years ago with Natural Born Killers (1994). Easily the most interesting issue touched on is the concept that much of what has defined generations and been the artistic impetus behind and symbol of cultural revolutions throughout the 20th century all comes from the same corrupted and cynical place; the music that has most embodied rebellion and freedom is actually even more manufactured than the worst boy band could ever be. This is a fascinating and fundamentally postmodernist idea, but mere moments after introducing it, Mitchell abandons the theme entirely in favour of a piece of gratuitous violence which says nothing of interest about anything.The most troubling thing about the film from a thematic point of view, however, is how it depicts women. Yes, it's partly about the male gaze and how Hollywood has a track record of objectifying women, especially in films of this nature, so a degree of objectification is necessary. But Mitchell does it to the point where critique simply becomes content - he doesn't need six women (only two of whom are even given names, and none of whom receive much in the way of characterisation) to throw themselves at Sam to adequately deconstruct the trope. Granted, his intentions may be noble; he is obviously side-lining the female characters with the goal of satirising male entitlement, but he is unable to distinguish between replication and repudiation. All the best intentions in the world don't alter the fact that the women in the film are wallpaper, and his attempt to critique Hollywood's tendency to depict women as such ends up as simply another example of the very trope he is setting out to critique. So all the unnecessary topless shots aren't exploitative you see, because irony!!And as for Sam's quest to find Sarah? In Mulholland Drive, Lynch creates a beautiful and complex tapestry where everything has precise meaning, no wasted motion, no weirdness simply for weirdness sake. In Silver Lake, on the other hand, Mitchell just lobs anything and everything at the viewer whether it's ultimately significant or not. A pirate? Sure. A female serial killer? Why not. A dog murderer? Of course. A story that makes sense and deals with its themes coherently? Don't be ridiculous. It's like the worst type of student film where the filmmaker has been allowed to shoot whatever he wants, and ends up making something so convoluted that any meaning it may have becomes subsumed amongst self-important pretension.Under the Silver Lake is a tiresome, self-important, overlong, intellectually juvenile mess. If Mitchell actually has anything to say about subliminal messaging, the commodification of women, wealth buying privileges even in the afterlife, the pervasiveness of pop culture, or conspiracy theories, it's lost within a painfully dull and self-indulgent plot. With Silver Lake, Mitchell has been allowed to play relatively unsupervised in the sandbox, and the results are disastrous; a swollen, self-admiring film that can't follow through on anything, thematically or narratively, a film that is totally and completely in love with itself.",Under the Silver Lake
55,Lewis_Heather787,"Bizarre, but I kinda like it!",7,7 December 2018,"You are either going to get this film or not pretty quickly on. This is an extremely weird and bizarre mishmash of stories and characters that you are likely to see in a film in 2018. So be warned that if you don't like this film your probably not alone, the same goes for if you loved it. For me personally I praise the film big time for the very adventurous film making that is on display. However even though I enjoyed the film and would say that it is good, I'm still rather perplexed by the film as a whole.There are so many things in this film whether that be cosmetic or story driven that appear in the film, that will leave you head scratching. However if your like me and quickly get used to just accepting the weirdness as it appeared on screen you will end up enjoying the experience. That is exactly what this film is an experience.The directing is an aspect that should be praised in this film. Right from the get go there are some really interesting and mind blowing uses of the camera, that drew me into the film straight away. It definitely grabbed my attention! Throughout the film the directing is superb and David Robert Mitchell's work should be noticed and appalled.For a relatively small film it has quite a large cast of actors that appear for a couple of scenes and then disappear. A couple of big names but most unknown for me. Obviously the one standout of the film is Andrew Garfield who plays a real low life but a really likeable guy. His character is someone that you can easily root for because he is relatable whether that is struggling with work or with money. He is an everyday guy with everyday problems and he is propelled into this incredible almost fantasy esc journey, trying to find a girl he barely knowns. Very much out of left field for Garfield but he excels in the spotlight.The story itself is quite simple in theory, Garfield's character is on the search for a girl who has mysteriously gone missing. However there are so many sub plots to this film and mis directions that keep you guessing, it makes you want to watch on to see the result. The twists and turns in this film you will definitely not see coming, some of the strangest things happen. If I'm being honest there is probably a bit to much going on at once with too many characters. But credit must go for attempting this, I'd rather this outcome than a safe, boring and predictable story.Overall this film is a rollercoaster of emotions, for me personally even though there are some parts to the film that don't makes sense. The fact that there are a lot of story threads going on at once that can be confusing, I ended up enjoying the experience and balls of this film to be very different to any other film I've seen in a while. 70% out 100 or 7 out of 10 I would actually consider this film to be good, however I would never but this on casually because it isn't the easiest film to follow. This is a film you either love or hate..............or actually in my case think is good.",Under the Silver Lake

What gets me is that production quality was excellent, sound and editing top quality, score very good. There were a lot of talented people working on this. It's just a shame that they fell into the LA ego trap and forgot the audience.
The main character did a good job. But the repetitive skunk thing stank.
I don't think there was anything original in this film. Maybe it had too many writers? Or just millenial who didn't contribute an original idea to this.

69,IamROCKAS,Life is kind of pointless and you should pick and choose your battles appropriately,9,9 August 2020,"The directing and overall style of the movie is like nothing I've ever seen before. The cinematography and the way the movie is incredibly stylized. Like I was watching the movie and whispering ""wow, this shot is cool"" in five-minute intervals if not more often. There are so many close-up face shots and long one-take shots, far shots that zoom-in on characters or give us a better look at the cityscape and the surrounding areas. It's all done in this 60's noir style that I kind I appreciated, even though I forgot that this was a modern neo-noir during the first quarter of the film, with a blend of surrealism and symbolism. Everything was shot and framed so perfectly to the point that every shot seemed like it had a hidden meaning behind it, an unknown purpose and at the same time, looked surreal, imaginative and raising a lot of questions about our sanity of understanding different views of certain media.To me, the story makes a lot of sense and the characters have clear motives. What happens as the movie goes along is incredibly engaging and I think one thing that helps make the movie engaging is the variety of scenery. Every sequence seems to be in a different location and that gives the movie a lot of fresh air, it never fails to be repetitive even though there are a lot of scenes in his apartment. You want to see where the different settings will take you, what they have to offer and what questions there will be answered for our protagonist and that makes the movie engaging from start to finish.I tend to geek out over the soundtracks and the score on this movie makes me scream and shout. I've heard orchestra pieces, I've heard electronic music pieces and even Nintendo music ques made the cut. From scene to scene, the score is different from the last scene and it works well in every scene it's used. And it's used well as it has an effect on every scene. It's not hidden somewhere in the background and it sort of feels like a defying part of the scene where it is used.Going towards the spoiler territory, let's talk about the nihilistic approach of this movie. Every character seemed gloomy in one way or another and the constant display of that emotional behavior seemed cool for its consistency. Even our protagonist went after Sarah and, in the end, it didn't even matter since he found her alive and he couldn't even do anything about it since she was stuck in the burial tomb so he just goes home. And that is it. The whole movie was building toward the ending where our protagonist either finds the girl or discovers a big dark secret. He finds her and it is pointless. His whole journey to get her completely pointless and useless and, in the end, he achieved nothing.There are so many things that were going on this movie, so many different sub-plots to follow and pay attention to, and once we start to connect the dots, in kind of makes sense. The protagonist is sex-driven and it makes sense that he went after one girl that he never ""did it"" with. Every girl we've seen him with, he had some kind of sexual interaction with, except the girl he was going after with. Throughout the movie, the are so many things going on that our protagonists kind of ignores because of his quest to find Sarah. Like there is an owl killer on the loose who slaughters people in their sleep, there's a dog killer too (I was sort of expecting a Fight Club twist where it turned out our protagonist was the killer without any knowledge of his alter-ego) that is just killing tons of dogs and our protagonists just doesn't seem to pay attention to. He even seemed to encounter the dog killer at one point and the next morning he didn't even care and he definitely encountered the owl person, he pointed the gun at her and she just disappeared and didn't come back. These things seem to be more important than chasing the girl but our protagonist just doesn't care. I think this movie was trying to say that society is focused on certain things that don't matter while the important things are happening under our noses and we don't care or we don't even notice that it is happening.This movie just screams ""I'm rewatchable"". There are so many little things that I noticed upon watching it and that begs the question of how many things I missed and how many more can I spot upon rewatching it? There are a lot of jabs at pop-culture, religion, political climate, etc. It seems to tackle almost everything while also giving the vibes of a cohesive product before it takes jabs at everything. The movie is just a great movie before it is a message of any sort.",Under the Silver Lake

71,writenamehere,Using pop culture to unravel pop culture?,1,15 June 2021,"Carl Jung said that whatever the neurotic mind did, it was only ever attempting to rebalance, and this film seems to rely on this idea entirely. I guess Under the Silver lake has a hopeful message, in a way, in that no matter how deluded and confused you are, if you allow yourself to become even more deluded and confused, eventually you'll pop out the other side of delusion and confusion. The difference between this film's idea and the films it imitates, with a sneering resentful tone, is that instead of the protagonist moving forward psychologically, he moves backwards, until he ends up at his beginning. There is a lot of self loathing and passive aggressive anger, directed in all sorts of directions - most of it towards women and the younger generations. Almost everything he thinks is destructive or takes the extreme long way round to solve his problem. I was going to turn it off after ten minutes, because not just the pointless sex and female nudity, but the attitude towards it, meant nothing useful was going to follow. Behind it all was a sense of superiority, so it's not useful transformative art, just a massive and deliberately misleading exercise in self expression.

I believe in it to some degree, but it's the kind of overly-cutesy clickbait trope I try to avoid. That said, the mystery of this film's expulsion to V.O.D. Hell is somewhat troubling to me. And I've taken it up as a personal mission of sorts to sell it to the masses as a great film by any means necessary, because, honestly, it's easily among the Top 10 films of 2019 or 2018 or literally any other year I've been on this earth watching movies.A Perfect Adaptation of the Best Book Tom Robbins Never WroteThat would be my title/angle for the boomers out there. I want everybody to watch this movie. After premiering at the 2018 Cannes Film Festival, the proper theatrical opening for Under the Silver Lake was pushed back multiple times, until ultimately getting dumped with a comically limited release; odds are you watched this film on Amazon if you watched it all.Far be it from me to use this space to go off on the behind the scenes mechanisms that lead to these decisions. Most of the time, I can't be bothered thinking about the marketing end of things for two seconds. But in the case of this particular film, I'm genuinely baffled. I'm baffled to such a degree that I find it hard to separate the two. What does loving this film as much as I do REALLY mean, man? What does it say about me and MY quest?Writer-Director David Robert Mitchell is of course known for the provocative STD horror-farce, It Follows (2014), a moody, low-budget, really effective and really good movie that became an independent success and garnered a near-cult second life on Netflix. It was impressive enough that A24 obviously let him do whatever the hell he wanted with his follow-up. The resulting 139-minute noir epic is a direct antithesis to that film. It's a sprawling, symphonic, and beautifully shot film with a Topher Grace peeping tom drone cameo. You could criticize this by saying it's trying to do and say too much; that's impossible to argue actually. My counter would be that it succeeds in this, though. It hath chewed and fully digested all that it has bitten off. One of the themes seems to be humanity's current inability to connect be it largely by way of unlimited distraction. So maybe it's fitting so many critics and focus groups couldn't or wouldn't allow the many dots to be connected. They don't deserve this movie.The supporting cast is largely excellent, but this daring journey works because of Andrew Garfield as Sam. It's honestly one of my favorite performances (and one of my favorite characters) in recent memory. He captures an aloof sadness that seems to be a hallmark of the 21st Century. You're rooting for him in spite of the subliminal wink-wink pulsating in the undercurrent that he's most likely going to end right back where he started.The long delay in releasing this film adds some (mostly meaningless) confusion to as whether we should consider this a 2018 and 2019 entry. It's the kind of vague housekeeping detail that would only drive someone as obsessed as I am at chronicling minutia insane. I guess I'm the target audience. I might be the only one.

I hadn't fully realised that the same director created It Follows, but, it makes complete sense upon completion.UTSL is coloured by David Lynch, incredibly so. The way Los Angeles is used and exalted is really Lynchian, additionally David Robert Mitchell has tapped into the compelling surrealism David Lynch accesses in his own films.Finally, I hope this is on purpose, but Mitchell has really gotten under the skin of the vacuous listlessness of Hipster culture.

85,nikxatz,"""Sex, Dizziness and the Truth about Hollywood: the movie""",8,30 June 2019,"Well, I actually watched this a week ago and I am still thinkng about it. It is an eperience, that's for sure.
Firstly, the whole film is so weird and dizzing... in a good way. There is a constant move, it is like an nevernending heist about solving a huge secret and new details and characters keep poping up and we get a lot of plolt ploints and new stuff to chew on and there are plenty of sureal sequences ... damn that's a thing. But overall this consant movement and fast pace creeate a thirst foro more and more and suddennly swimming ""Under the Silver Lake"" turns into a bumpy but joful time.
So, the mood and the tone are unique and the direction is surely innovative.
Moreover, this art piece manages to not onl serve as a thrillin mystery story but it also serves as a hillarious and honest satire on pop culture and of the mother of every thing we view today...Hollywood. The crititism is just so fun to watch...it shows how every emotion we ever had, every time we shaked our headswhile listening to a nice beat or every poster we see or every film we watch and love are all nothing more than a product for the mass to consume so that money are made. Nothing personal or sentimental.. just a piece of souless product. And I actually get that point. Every single blockbuster aims at being 'cool', ""catchy"", ""sellable"" so we the audience fall in love with it and make it a part of our lives and ignore that all these...is money and that there is a dark aspect to them, a practical one, a ""dirty,malicious"" side of funky pop songs and old classic films. Boom on you, Disney!
Also, it's about our nature. The protagonist, Sam, is addicted to women. But to every woman .He oversexualises every femle he sees but never wants to show cause deep down there is shame. He is a loser, a sinner, a failure living in a world were he thinks he is a hero.He stinks, he is paranoic and acts weird and dangerous. He is one of us who fight so strong for a cause till they find it and keep going for anotoher one. He is lost. But we don't hate due to one reason...
And that's Andrew Garlfield. What a performance. He brings life to the character. He is more sympathetic and his weirdness feels justifiable. Brilliant acting.
The soundtrack is fantastic. From a blues and jazz 60's Hitchcockian vibe to R.E.M and Jesus and The Brides of Dracula...really loved it
It is also obvious that a certain amount of focus was given to the production and the placess to shoot. They look fabulous and make this universe feel real and alive.
These were my thoughts. As you can see this film has lots of things to praise and discuss but it is a diizzing ride and it splits adiences for sure...It's ok if you dislike it, but I actually found it a fun mystery with lots of style and a fitting commentary. After wathcing I was dizzed but I love being dizzed.
Need a rewatch for sure.

Andrew Garfield gave a great performance and I enjoyed the bonkers trip he embarked on. Some of the themes and story elements are absolutely nailed here. Especially in the second half which smoothed out some of the films rough edges. The cinematography was absolutely gorgeous and creative. So much was great about the film and yet something is holding me back from truly loving it. This might have to do with the overabundance of symbolism and thematic ideas. I feel like the film had so many good ideas and didn't know what to do with half of them.These ideas are either underdeveloped, unresolved or confused. The first half of the film is especially evident in these problems. I also don't know how much the satire was intentional, or even, what the filmmaker was trying to satirise half the time. There were elements of it with the whole male gaze, dog and woman motifs but I felt that it could've used refining. Luckily the second half does pick up in almost every way. Sam's revelation at the end makes the film oddly heartbreaking and poignant. Apart from the pacing and certain aspects of the payoff, I thought it was the highlight of the film.Flawed?

Then she disappears from the neighbourhood and he starts to look for her everywhere, which brings him in a lot of weird, fancy, secret LA parties.
Meanwhile, he is also interested in some weird comic book telling the stories of urban legends like a guy obsessed by killing dogs, and he also starts to decrypt secret codes from pop songs, because all pop songs contains secret codes. Feeling lost yet ? This is just the beginning.So this is a 2-hours-long random voyage of this lazy guy trying to find this girl in LA for absolutely no reason (he likes her ass though), and it serves as a pretext for creating tons of clip-based visuals, which are nice, but as you may expect, make no sense at all.He finds himself hiking in the back of the Hollywood sign, finding some cult where people bury themselves in a bunker-styled house for six months before hoping to be elected in an elevated life. And you remember the killing dog thing ? Just kiding, there is no relation whatsoever. Oh, did I mention the masked vampire who kill some guys in their sleep ? Again, no relation, no purpose. Just a fantasy added, like you put some sugar on a disgusting cake.But you know, there is always someone naive enough to try to find the metaphorical, artsy meaning in all of this, so why not play the pretentious card and end up in Cannes festival ? Whatever works !I just forgot ! He likes to bang his old hillbilly neighbour sometimes. Quite a piece of writing, right ?The music is unbearable. Actually it's quite normal as it brings a mystery tone, but it just used all the time. After one hour, I swear to God I could put the whole orchestra on fire. I never saw music used so badly.

In the middle I thought : ""My god, so much mysteries involved ! The ending must be an incredible climax ! "" There is no ending. Nothing is resolved. You will have no answers. Why respecting the spectator when you can just pretend he needs to elaborate by himself ? Nothing to elaborate here, this is just a bad joke. You pretended to be Hitchcock with your crappy Vertigo effects, you pretended to be Terrence Malick with your failed contemplative atmosphere, you attempted to be Quentin Dupieux and create an cinematic UFO, but you have just no clue what you're doing, don't you.Good visuals, horrible writing.

91,gooseshaw,A puzzle of a movie with extensive payoff.,9,1 April 2020,"Much of this movie may have gone over my head, but I think that after multiple viewings I'd only grow to appreciate it more. I went into this movie knowing it was very divisive and I had heard that it was some kind of commentary on Hollywood and the general 'shallowness' of the city and it's industry. Because of this, I was able to confirm some interpretations and observations that I'd made during the movie. There's definitely much more to this film than I can go through here. The movie is a jab against Hollywood and it's objectification of women, it's constant obsession with sex and partying, as well as it's inflation of it's own self-worth.The elite characters in the film (mostly background characters) have supposedly been secretly communicating with each other through television. At the end of the movie, we find out they have plans to ascend into some otherworldly realm, because they, unlike normal people, are worthy and wealthy enough to accomplish the ascension (by building giant underground bunkers and faking their own deaths). These Hollywood elite each bring three women with them to use as their sex partners - and the women themselves, all of whom are struggling actresses who moonlight as prostitutes, join these men willingly, essentially selling themselves out for this dream. A comment made by Sarah (the missing girl), illustrates the Hollywood mentality. Something along the lines of ""well I'm here now and I can't go back so I may as well enjoy and indulge myself.""Some of these messages, of which the movie seems to be filled with, are quite obvious. Others however, I still don't understand. Who is the Owl Woman? I've seen one comment on the internet claiming she's a representation of suicide - but then why an owl? Why is there a killer obsessed with dogs, and what is the significance of dogs in the movie? This one is pretty big and I'm disappointment in myself for not understanding it just yet. And who is the music writer and why is it so important that he wrote all of the pop music that everyone has loved for the past half century? Perhaps this is simply a claim by the director that Hollywood is essentially of one mind - that it is not, as we like to believe, a collection of artists coming together to create great works, but rather a sort of corporate product that has been sold to us in order to influence us over the course of our lives.Aside from these hidden meanings, the movie is extremely enjoyable on a more basic level. The setting and music provides the viewer with a wonderfully fun neo-noir atmosphere. The characters are all interesting and very well acted. The mysterious story is beyond compelling - in that you as the viewer must follow the plot progression, piecing together the clues that the protagonist finds, while also searching for the hidden meanings within the film.

95,toonyjakes,"I feel as if I got hustled, artistically. Let me be thorough.",5,19 July 2019,"Under the Silver Lake was a movie I wanted to see from the moment I saw the preview. It looked funny, with a mystery overtone and unique choice for a protagonist. But after just finishing it I can affirm that those are only small components of this grand, yet extremely anticlimactic film.Plot- A man looks for a neighbor girl after she mysteriously moves out one night, the first night they actually meet. And as for what follows, wow. There's so many plot plants, allusions to pop culture that make you curious, and side stories that seem too crazy to tie together. Well, it is true, they never connect- in such a bad way that my rating was only based on the lazy ending. I was robbed.Writing- An original movie with noir impulses, pop cultural references, and a dash of creepy horror. The comedy mainly comes from the protagonist, a stoner 20 something who brings a new persepctive to the mystery genre- he's just a jobless dude with nothing to do but conspire. That ending though... huge killer. The main theme is coincidence, and by the end you see that more than half of them were useless. We have an unexplained dog killer, an unexplained murderous siren, and alot of things the protagonist did are disregarded or inexplicable at moments. Even the main plotline is concluded before it ends, and that was just plain lazy, truly shut down the intrigue within me.Characters/Acting- The protagonist is likeable, although he isn't written out sensibly after he does something incredibly surprising about half way through. Other characters act more as a guide rather than being memorable or three dimensional. Acting was never bad for a moment though.Quality- The music was stellar even though at some points it was over dramatic. Cinematography was excellent. The editing was good but it has way too many of those 'dissolve' moments where one scene fades into another, which will leave people asking ""Did he really do that? Was that a dream of his?""Overall, this film left me feeling hungry, dry, confused- all accompanied by a long lasting case of blue balls. It was so great until just after the middle of the third act, where the amount of mystery and coincidences become so overbearing it's not even mysterious anymore, yet you'll be hopeful still. For all it presents to you, for how intriguing it is, this is essentially a film that was probly intended to be three hours, but they didnt know how to wrap up the ending at all.

Mitchell is an auteur with a distinctive style which comes across strongly in this movie. Garfield is very engaging as the rather unpleasant 30 something slacker, Sam. A bit of a waster who somehow gets embroiled in a weird and wonderful mystery after his sexy blonde neighbour disappears. The cast is large, the locations in LA are strange and dreamlike and it plays like a wacko dramedy with neo noir overtones. It's an homage to Hitchcock and Lynch and you can see the influence of these two greats in this movie but it's also a very original ramble through one man's particular obsession. It's a very long movie but doesn't feel like it. Garfield is in every scene and is brilliant. He plays world weary and scuzzy very well! Riley Keogh plays the femme fatale whose vanishing act gets Sam started on his quest, and she doesn't have to do much but look gorgeous. The rest of the large cast play their parts well, but its Garfield's movie. The plot is surreal and ridiculous and ends with as many questions as answers. The scene where Sam gets his hand stuck to a copy of a Spiderman comic book is hilarious and a nod to Garfield's role as the web slinger! Quite a few Easter eggs and in jokes if you look for them.

Just fantastic. When this one came out I expected more of the same.Not quite. This is uber black WTF comedy of the highest order. My homesters and I have been watching each scene with scrutiny and evaporating into uncontrollable laughter with every scene setting, bizarre character introduction, plot and music twist, and especially Andrew Garfield's hopeless expressions as the carnival of outrageous nonsense takes place all around him.We have been luxuriating in this existential masterpiece for endless hours, pointing out favorite background characters, objects and landmarks, sometimes playing a scene four or five times until we can't stand it any more. Through it all Andrew Garfield leads us along as our eyes water and ribs ache from our hysteria.OK so it takes a special type of humor to laugh at this film I suppose, and it also helps if you have warped friends with unconventional recreation habits. Find some and watch it. Lots of gratitude to Mr. Mitchell for this gem.",Under the Silver Lake

101,FlickChick82,WTF???!!!!!,2,30 March 2019,"Stay away from this atrocity of a film. If only I had. The only good thing about it is the music score throughout. If one closes one's eyes, it gives one an illusion of watching or better yet listening to a Hitchcock film. There are a few nods to the master himself, such as the opening scene, which is very reminiscent of his classic Rear window, then Vertigo although by a long shot, a blonde as the main character's obsession and a scene with a memorial site dedicated to him. Furthermore what's good is a quote: ""I saw you spying on me earlier"" and advice that one character gives to another, suggesting to buy a dog in order to get unconditional love, because it would do that person good. Technical details of the film are decently executed, for instance, directing, cinematography, but what ruins it is the incoherent plot masked as a script.",Under the Silver Lake
102,thetyvonlesure,An Uncanny Mystery Film,7,3 July 2019,"Under the Silver Lake is an unusual take on Film Noir. It's a weird love letter to the Golden Age of Hollywood. The film is riddled from head to toe with mystery and hidden messages. The cryptic messages within this film are entirely unsolvable in the first viewing. Despite the film's vague meaning, it is remarkable on a technical scale. The cinematography within this film is very unique, yet cohesive and well done. The liberties taken with the style of this film perfectly blends humor, suspense, and mystery. Andrew Garfield does a great job of portraying the lead, who is very frantic and paranoid. This is a weird film, but with multiple viewings there is likely a more complete picture. This film will hit with some and miss with others. It deserves the nomenclature of this generation's (late 2010's) Blue Velvet. Overall, Under the Silver Lake is an unusual work of art that will likely go down as a Cult Classic.",Under the Silver Lake

104,uberdonkey6,"Original, brilliantly filmed",9,15 December 2018,"There is so much to love about this film. It is in the genre of mystery.. an unemployed relaxed but driven young guy looking for a pretty girl through a web of odd clues, urban myths that may be real, and lots of subplots and atmospheric pieces that provide a rich and interesting texture which never bores and constantly surprises. The soundtrack, both the instrumental and the songs that form part of the story, are excellent and an integral part of the movie. The cinematography is unique, clean, beautiful and adds to the suspense and the (noir) atmosphere. Some of the subplots don't seem to be resolved, but that doesn't seem to matter because the whole film is somewhat quirky. The lead is perfect, and supporting actors also well played.This isn't an 'art-house film' but it is certainly a work of art which suggests the director either spent a long time thinking about and carefully planning this or he simply a natural genius. Not only would I recommend anyone (above 16) to watch this, but in 20 years time I'd say watch it again. Indeed, there are few films I could see twice, but this is one of them. I didn't give it a ten because the actual reveal maybe isn't as interesting or fulfilling as I would have expected, but I don't think that's necessarily the important part of the film, and indeed the ending doesn't necessarily conclude everything with satisfaction, but that really is part of many of the events.. true to life, not everything is concluded neatly or can be shown to have a meaning we can decipher.",Under the Silver Lake
105,rsj624,A Scathing Critique on Modernity,9,5 November 2020,"First and formost, dude better not have actually written in permanent black marker on the zelda fold-out map from Nintendo Power Magazine Issue #1... Just sayin. Okay, onto the review!""We crave Mystery, because there is none left"".This single line uttered during the runtime of Under a Silver Lake perhaps hit me the hardest of them all. I have spent most of my cinema going time as of late journeying through the 60s and 70s, in search of the next great thriller/horror or mystery film I had yet to see. So even thought this line within the context of said film is meant to imply more of a loss of originality and imagination in the modern world, it spoke volumes to me on a personal level. Under the Silver Lake a modern day take on the classic mystery films of old, and boy does it deliver on all the key ingredients that made its many inspirations so great in the first place.Under the Silver Lake stands as one of the few rare films in recent times that follows no rules but its it's own, and ventures fearlessly into the limitless realm of cinema at it's most adventurous and entertaining. But let me state that it is by no means a perfect film before I gush all over it. It does feel way on the long side at an over 2 hour runtime, and many segments felt like they were used to pad out and better pace the film. The ending is a bit of a letdown and some loose ends are never addressed, yet, those are hardly complaints when considering the scope and ambition and mystery of the warped LA world we are introduced to, not to mention that even at its worst I was still more entertained than I ever thought it'd be.It's a scathing critique of modernity, pairing pop culture with conspiracy theory in which director David Robert Micthell employees the same dizzying world logic he used in his last film ""It Follows"", to provide us with what feels like a surreal journey through a beautifully nightmarish landscape, populated by characters as alluring as they are apathetic. It's all about the layers here, and there are plenty of them to peel back. It's aethestics, both good and bad saturate the world in which nothing is what it seems, yet everything is as basic as it appears. Andrew Garfield's aimlessly incorrigible take on a clueless protagonist blundering through an amateur detective-esque parade of bizzare occurrences and inconsequential encounters, just to find a girl he likes, simultaneously feel like a whole lot of nothings, within a whole lot of somethings. It's quite the achievement in my opinion for a film to balance so many opposing elements, yet all frame under such a titled, but cohesive narrative.But most importantly it's just a fun movie to watch. It doesn't take itself as seriously as it seems, yet it's obvious a lot of work went into making everything feel as finely crafted as possible, something I feel few films outside of maybe The Lighthouse, Little Women, and Marriage Story from last year managed to successfully do. Again, this isn't to say its perfect, and those other films I mentioned are a better watch in my opinion, and indeed Under a Silver Lake could even be considered 'goofy' at times, but it's nice to see a film be so genuienly daring.Here's to hoping at the very least in time it finds it's audience, and can become a cult classic. I recommend this one to any film lover who feel things have been a bit stale lately, and need a good dose of the wild and weird.",Under the Silver Lake

The amount of truth and allegories in this movie was fun to watch and kept me interested to the very end. This film can be Interpreted in so many different ways it's amazing.

113,jramza-1,It was like reading only halfway through the Davinci Code,2,26 December 2019,"The movie begins with an intriguing set up and what seems to be careful character development, given it's very slow, methodical pace. This is backed up by a very dramatic, stirring and amplified musical score reminiscent of the 1950's Hitchcock films, that hints of oncoming mysteries and a journey to solve them. Slowly (very, very slowly), the plot (which seems less methodical and more randomly meandering) leads us to a character who is a conspiracy theorist, who presents several conspiracies to the protagonist (several), all of which are then introduced to the film as well. Interspersed throughout all of this are random, highly graphic scenes of the protagonist in casual sexual encounters. One wonders if this is somehow conveying a tragic inability of the protagonist to cope, or some other nuanced message; after the final encounter, I personally came to the conclusion it was just soft porn. Also interspersed are scenes of the protagonist brutally assaulting 2 children, and another brutal, bloody and explicit killing.Then, like the Deus ex machine of Greek tragedies, we're provided only one simple nugget of explanation to only one of the protagonist's mysteries, which somehow is supposed to bring resolution (not even close) and the movie ends. At this point, despite all of the character development, I did not feel like I knew this main character AT ALL. I could not discern if he was tragic or victorious, insightful or psychotic, the hero or just one of the villains. I don't think this is a spoiler ; I don't think I COULD give a spoiler for this movie. In the end, it was well-acted, but very poorly scripted, strangely scored, and confusingly contrived. I would sum it up as long, tedious scenes for character development that ends up vague, with never-ending plot set ups for mystery and shock that are never resolved, interspersed with gratuitous violence and soft porn.",Under the Silver Lake
114,corceiro,Beautiful movie.,8,30 December 2018,"It is one of those movies that today is considered as excellent, because it moves away from the simplistic paradigms of the current cinema. It's like a mix between david lynch and alfred hitchcock, sometimes he approaches ""Vertigo"", in others it recalls ""Mullholland Drive"" but it seems to me that the quotations of the two masters are assumed by the author and function as a tribute to a cinema which is, unfortunately, rare. The narrative construction reminds me also of the Coen brothers, in the notes of subtle humor and in the construction of some characters. But, mind you, these references to the most accomplished directors do not detract from the quality of David Robert Mitchell's work! After all, our whole culture is a broth of influences and learning and in this case I think the final result is very interesting and contribute positively to the history of cinema.

Andrew Garfield is amazing and really unlike anything he's done before, and Riley Keogh comedic and silly, with fantastic cameos from just about every indie actor with any shine right now popping up here and there. It's been such a long time since a film as rich and crazy as this one came along, and it captures the city so well in its present incarnation. With its life hacking theme, it's right on the button for now, and with its trippy, stoned atmosphere and true to life locations and events, this film is the antidote or even the poison to the terribly boring LALA Land.

This movie takes itself way too serious at times and then, not too serious at other times in the worst way possible. If it had simply followed the original plot and erased a good 45 minutes of nonsense it might have actually been interesting to watch. Instead what it gives you is eye strain. I give it a 5 just based on visual style and score. Script was way too all over the place. I don't believe it deserves a 1 by any means as they would be total and utter garbage movies that are 10-50K in budget and lack any amount of talent of visual flair or substance.

I couldn't stop thinking about Mullholland Drive all the way through, which took away some of the shine from what should have been a very interesting film in it's own right.There are some really interesting moments of mystery and trippy delight that really captures Los Angeles in the same way Lynch managed to. But where Mullholland Drive excelled was in staying power right to the end and the ability to make the viewer intrigued well after the movie had finished. 'Silver Lake' does that to a point but has so many references / puzzles / guessing games that the final 20 minutes seems more of a chore than a crescendo. The amount of movie / pop culture / music references is insane and I agree with another reviewer that this could all be a nod to Mitchell's own experiences of trucking around Hollywood wondering where his next move is going to take him.I still think this could be a cult classic in years to come and is a tidy enough paranoid thriller.

To put it short: the picture seems not able to decide what it wants to be. Some might call it an experimental mix of genres, yet it felt more like indecisiveness to me.The individual scenes are good, not great, but good. The complete film just couldn't win me over.Furthermore I am kind of pissed of about the plot (don't worry, I'm not going to spoil anything).

It sounds like these viewers were expecting some bang! boom! action film, but found a thoughtful and intriguing ode to Hollywood instead and were disappointed. If you actually appreciate movies and classics, then disregard these 1 star, pedestrian reviews. Maybe they should stick with pointless Disney remakes, Vin Diesel, and Megatron because this movie was great. It feels like a collage made of all things Hollywood. Hitchcock's grave makes an appearance (as does his style. . . but with love). Think ""Rear Window"" or ""Vertigo"" meets ""Donnie Darko"" with a hefty helping of ""Mulholland Drive"".
I would say the three directors alluded to most in this film would be Hitch, Richard Kelly and David Lynch. A lot of Marilyn Monroe references. ""Somethings Gotta Give"" and ""Let's Make Love"" alongside Spider Man and Barbie props. Dead actresses. Hidden messages. Substitution Codes. An underground Hollywood, ran by cults and running the world through pop culture. ""Starlets"" moonlighting as prostitutes. There's interesting characters like ""The Homeless King"", ""The Owl Woman"", and the mysterious (and hidden) ""The Dog Killer"". It IS a mash up, not gonna lie. One moment you hear ""To Sir, With Love"" and the next it's blaring ""What's the Frequency Kenneth?"". But It's NOT ""Transformers 12"", so no explosions, nor is an Avenger gonna Knock you from scene to scene. Instead it's a steady wave of curiosities that keeps the wheels in your mind constantly turning. Hell, I'm just happy to see original content. No sequel. No capes. It's a love letter to everything that has or may have lurked in the Tinseltown shadows this past 100 years. If you didn't like it, odds are you missed some (or all) of the references.

Maybe it's me and I didn't understood the subtle meaning of the movie, but I'm quite sure I wasn't drunk when I watched it.
I would have given an 8 to this movie for the characters and places the movie was shot, but watching further I was kinda disappointed because the movie was going nowhere.
Then I thought maybe it deserves a 7, but in the end I changed my mind and gave the movie a 6 just because it had no sense.
It wasn't like a movie with those unpredictable endings but it was like an unpredictable nonsense and maybe waste of time ?
I don't regret I watched it, but I just thought it will end in a different way.",Under the Silver Lake

UTSL is admirably confident, but it doesn't pay off because all of its many elements merge into an ending that is underwhelming at best.What the film does well is keep the story entertaining and leaves you wanting to see the next step in the mystery unfold (although the pacing is brutal at times). Ultimately, it just isn't enough to make this movie the type of grand metaphor that it thinks it is. As I said earlier, the confidence is admirable, but by the end turns laughable at the same time. It just doesn't make sense. The acting performances are pretty solid, but a lot of the characters that seem important have no real purpose.I enjoyed watching Under the Silver Lake for the first time through, but I don't foresee myself revisiting it anytime soon.

143,TheUserIDYouEnteredHasAlready,I really enjoyed this meandering take on 2018 Cali-noir,8,30 December 2018,"This is an interesting title to review - both for professional critics (they must attempt to juxtapose it with their reviews of ""It Follows"") and for people like me (who feel the need to turn people ON to it that I think would like it and OFF to those I think will trash it).Style - I'd call this a neo-noir with a bit of a hipster/slacker shaggy dog detective story thrown in, but it doesn't take itself too seriously. That's key because a lot of the negative or confused reviewers didn't seem to just turn off their minds and follow along, which is what I think the director intended. In any case, it's just got a cool vibe. Not overdone, but it combines with some of the soundtrack (which at times is an over the top rendition of ""LA Confidential's"") to create just enough of a modern sunshine-noir world for our protagonist.Scene - Clearly this is some kind of homage to the Los Angeles / Hollywood area. Very lovingly depicts numerous overlooked locations and gently pokes fun at the conventions of the young, hip 'rising stars', the people who cling to them, the music they listen(ed) to, and the parties they attend.Soundtrack - I'm a bit biased, but I loved it. Very much a combination of a throwback to my 90s upbringing, modern pop and and the aforementioned sweeping cinematic noir pieces reminiscent of ""Chinatown"" and ""LA Confidential.""Plot - I won't give too much away and I did have to watch it a few times due to sheer length, but I will suggest that you go into it with no expectations. There's nothing too unbelievable about what transpires, and the main character is clearly a total slacker with all the wrong priorities. Sort of a millennial ""white male gaze"" is how I've read it described, and that's accurate. How his apartment (and it's in a very expensive locale) got furnished with all the nice stuff he has is a question for another review. The treatment of women is along those lines - maybe borderline misogynistic, but just accurate for the demographic and story.All in all this director did a good job of blending a few of his influences and putting his own spin on a newer genre that he clearly appreciates. It doesn't take itself seriously like ""LA Confidential"" or even ""After Dark My Sweet"" - or for that matter, Rian Johnson's ""Brick"", which for a long time was one of my favorite movies - but takes itself way more seriously than ""Under the Silver Lake"" which gets my qualified recommendation if you have the patience and willingness to turn off all expectations but to be entertained, then sit back and soak it all in.",Under the Silver Lake

I was enjoying this

Just happenedThe most interesting thing is that, despite being restless, I continued to be more interested in the development of the film, and with each addition of character, with each addition of context, I became more interested.
The end of the second act occurs in interesting, intelligent, agonizing and certain formations.The third act ended the film almost the same way it started, but from a different angle and perspective. It ended in the perspective in which the protagonist saw himself, in a house opposite to his (literally).
Even with a sweeping ending (like all endings in an A24 film), ""Under the Silver Lake"" caught my eye in a positive way. Even with its ups and downs, I liked it.

Being a conspiracy flick, Mitchell uses the very subject of conspiracy as the main plot device(s). My issue with this is that it's not very efficient as a movie. Too many ideas with not one of them really delivering a satisfying punchline. I may have appreciated it more if one did. The main character spends too much time sitting, walking, or staring around. It's basically a version of tell and not show with too much backstory that turns out to be unimportant woven into the movie.What I did like was that Mitchell was still able to keep me interested. His camera moves nicely and his cinematographer does his best Hitchcock impersonation which isn't bad at all, along with the music. Was hoping for more, but hopefully this is something to build on for David Robert Mitchell. 'It Follows' is a superior film to this. I just hope he has a breakthrough on his next outing.

The movie is interesting in that it has an out-of-the-ordinary lead character and, above all, an out-of-the-ordinary plot. It is sometimes rather hard to follow what Sam is up to, and about what's meant to be real and what's not, however director David Mitchell manages to sustain a sufficiently intriguing atmosphere for most of the duration of the film. What I especially enjoyed were the original shot selection (camera angles) and numerous hints to classic movies and hall-of-fame directors.A big minor of this film, I found, is that it is at least 15 mins too long. At a certain point you reach a level of saturation, resulting in confusion over what the movie is actually about.

I fully expect the 1 star reviews to outnumber the 10 star reviews by a 2-to-1 margin. Personally, I wanted to like it more than I actually did, given I often like things off the beaten path that this movie is determined to avoid. But, ultimately, the movie failed to pull me in on any level.The plot owes a lot to Thomas Pynchon's ""The Crying of lot 49"" (and a bit to Umberto Eco's ""Foucault's Pendulum""), as we follow a protagonist investigating a bunch of mysterious conspiracy threads that lead him down an increasingly perilous and bottomless rabbit hole. The style is something of a mashup of ""John Dies in the End"", ""North by Northwest"", and any David Lynch movie--hallucinatory, paranoid, and somewhat aimless.Given the apparent literary and thematic ambitions, it is a shame it came off as sophomoric to me. It always felt like the writer/director was trying too hard to be clever and literary. It never felt like a movie in itself, but rather a collection of allusions to other movies and literary themes. Or to put it another way, it felt like one big ""in joke"", at the audiences' expense.It might be that I simply found the cast's ""A-listers"" slumming in indie-ville entirely unconvincing (Andrew Garfield never felt like he was playing anything but himself, ""the Dude""-he ain't). In this way, it reminded me of ""Southland Tales"". Self-serving, self-conscious cameos with a wink and nod; it distracts and detracts.All that said, I enjoy the idea of this movie. Writer/Directors should be encouraged in ""straying from the path"". But they just need to keep in mind the effort to bring the viewer with them on that journey.

Its quirky to be sure and older viewers might enjoy seeing what hip young people get up to in LA after the sun goes down. If those bars are all real some are quite cool - one looked like a mausoleum. Garfield plays a smelly guy who you don't really end up rooting for. However he does act with an awe-inspiring deranged intensity at times. At first you go down a couple of rabbit tunnels and are keen to see where it all ends, as it is all quirky and curious. However after a while it starts to drag a bit and there are just so many plot lines that parts of the movie don't make any sense and it just runs way too long. A subplot about a composer dictating all our generational music moods really proved unsatisfying for me. Ultimately there is no mystery and at least 30 minutes could have been cut out of the time. I liked the balloon girl.... but like other reviewers was disappointed by the blatant 'male gaze' of the main character.

I think he's terribly underrated and I also think he was an excellent Spider-Man/Peter Parker. Watch out for the neat little injoke in this film about that. Under The Silver Lake is a very, very odd duck. It's waaay too long for its own good. At the same time you never lose interest in what's going on. But it is still detrimental. I watched this in two segments, doing some cooking, taking a shower, etc in between. Perhaps this would've worked better as a Netflix mini-series instead. The main draw here is Garfield but there are many cool little characters showing up along the way. It's all very mysterious and strange. Sort of a teen noir anti La La Land, if that makes any sense. Garfield's character meets a girl he gets instantly smitten with. When she suddenly disappears he starts on a very bizarre quest to find her. Along the way he meets all sorts of odd characters. I loved all the little cool pop culture references sprinkled throughout as well as the hints at a much seedier semi-hidden part of the entertainment industry, such as low level actresses ""escorting"" on the side in between movie jobs and the hit maker Garfield encounters in the mansion. It's very hard to describe the film or the plot. It's a journey you have to take for yourself. You might regret it, you might love it but definitely see it.

Leaning toward keeping a mysterious mood rather than making the film spell out its intention, which isn't always a bad thing, but its not interesting enough to keep the viewer wanting to find out what's going on. In other words - it just gets boring. It has a nice Hitchcock feel (including lovely use of music), along with a modern, if not an entirely original take on film noir but the story just isn't nearly dramatic enough.

170,sean3240,This really surprised me,9,24 April 2021,"I have been disappointed both times I watched 'It Follows' and didn't think I'd be able to get into other stuff by this director. I was absolutely wrong.Within probably 20 minutes of watching the movie I knew I was in good hands. The weird tone and performances which matched it were done so tastefully. This is an area which many movies can easily go wrong in for me because they just try to be as ""WTF"" as possible and just lose you all together. 'Weird for the sake of weird' is often a problem for me and I find this movie fully justified in it's weirdness. After the set up had shown me what this movie was gonna be like, I was able to relax and take in these crazy ideas the story presents and the wonderfully abstract ways in which it shows us them.The cinematography is really prominent in this, colours really pop and there's some really beautiful shots. It is however almost good to a fault, it feels really polished, it starts to take away from any authenticity of it when you're so aware of what they're doing with the visuals all the time. Also, there's quite a darkness to the film and that character, and I don't feel the cinematography reflects that enough considering how reflective everything else is of how he's thinking.Andrew Garfields performance is fantastic in this. He's always great in anything I've see him in, but in this I was really blown away. He manages to blend the lines between cool and creepy for this character, while also being really funny at times. The whole movie is really from that characters perspective, and so fittingly the movies tone fits that description of the character (cool, creepy and kinda funny). Because of how perfectly he fits into the film I can only imagine Garfield is playing this character exactly as the director envisioned, which I'm sure not only made the directors job easier, but also helps him to further develop the very specific tone of this movie as he sees the character played out.Even at its most convoluted, the story has every excuse to be, because searching for some sort of hidden meaning in the film fits exactly into the themes it was already putting forward, as this search for meaning is exactly what the main character is going through. I really think this is what 'Inherent Vice' should've been.I only really wanted to talk about the technical aspects of the film in this review. Talking about what it meant for me will just remove an aspect of enjoyment I got out of it, and will hopefully get on rewatches or even just from reflecting on the film. The dream-like nature of it doesn't try to imply a concrete meaning, and so it would just be ruining the fun to boil it down to a couple of ideas.Maybe what's really under the silver lake is the friends we made along the way.",Under the Silver Lake

The nearest thing to a Lynch movie you'll see (other than from the man himself) and for a film that is so deep and layered then it is extremely easy to follow when considering the tale. An enchanting movie of the highest calibre",Under the Silver Lake

It's one of the best movies I've ever, Completely underrated and completely addicting as well. The soundtrack is a perfect Noire style soundtrack Linking each mysterious seen almost effortlessly",Under the Silver Lake
177,CMTempest,Not to be missed,8,15 March 2019,"Under The Silver Lake is an immensely rewarding and clever little noir that's intriguing and breaks new ground for the genre. Indeed, on top of having a seriously wacked out premise/concept, one which effectively lends itself to delicious wierdness at evey turn, what's perhaps most exciting of all about Mitchell's sophmore effort is that it actually manages to be accesible enough to keep you watches in spite of its mounting absurdity. Mitchell expertly maintains a constant aura of peculiar intrigue, while simultaneous relaying a story that's growing increasingly off-the-wall random and zany by the moment. It's the perfect blend of nioristic hard-boiled sluething and reefer fuled paraniod conspiratory existential absurdist madness.Yes, it's a trip. No, you have not seen anything quite like it before. While comparisons to The Big Lebowski, The Player, Inherent Vice, and Mulholland Drive are inevitable (because clearly they all explore some similar themes), in this case these comparisons are indeed earned. In my opinion, Under The Silver Lake is every bit as good as these classics, and I hope it ultimately achieves the level of recognition it deserves. Don't miss out on this one! It's a refeshingly succesful genre gamechanger that doesn't in any way dissapoint. I honestly can't wait to see what Mitchell does next, and I hope that this is profitable enough that he will be able to keep all creative control of his future projects.",Under the Silver Lake

This is a thoroughly fleshed out concept that goes leaps and bounds over what you initially think. It progresses from one absurd set-piece, onwards. Andrew Garfield is spot on here with his performance. I found myself wanting more and more, and then by seemingly the third act I was not disappointed. This all plays like an ode to Hollywood during the early 1900's and how it was cutthroat then, just as much as it is now. Garfield's a deadbeat in LA, and the theme of ""work"" continuously pops up. It's one fat piece of dreams can come here to die; wrapped in an esoteric - super-sensualized murder mystery nightmare. Until it wasn't...",Under the Silver Lake

Just like the best works by the many auteur's named in the above reviews ( Lynch, Hitchcock, Roeg etc) the ""plot"" is not the point. This is what cinema does best when it's done well. It makes u feel things and depending on the viewer, almost any scene in USL can titillate one while annoying someone else. Did anyone else contemplate that Sam's car, apartment and even his life may not have really been his? That he may have been a sociopathic killer that simply became obsessed with random folks, murdered them and then simply became them afterwards? I kept getting flashes of American Psycho. Sam, clearly an unreliable narrator, seemed to be surrounded by people who only saw their peers as interchangeable objects, there for them to use as they saw fit. Where is this more true than young Hollywood? Women bark like dogs, no one remembers anyone's name, ""he was a producer, she's an actor/artist"". This only propels the paranoia of a world totally under the control of a powerful elite cabal's deeply coded reality. Why else is he/she famous while I'm struggling?!?

I never figured out who the dog killer was. What was that part about the followers and their religion under ground? Why didn't he try to get a job? Why did he have to park his car so far away, take that long, dark, winding path just to get to his apartment? The ending revealed nothing as I lost sight of the girl he was looking for since he met so many others in between. What a waste of time. Don't bother.",Under the Silver Lake

187,lucasacosta,Lo que esconde Silver Lake,7,21 December 2018,"Ignorando los aspectos técnicos que en Under the Silver Lake no fallan, el Director que nos deleitó con la película de terror definitiva de la década (It Follows), esta vez nos muestra un thriller de conspiración, en teoría, clásico, pero en la práctica. , más cercano a un trabajo que puede considerarse parodia. Y esto no es algo negativo, es solo que parece que nos enfrentamos al trabajo de alguien que conoce perfectamente el Film Noir y la parodia y, mejor aún, es un genio cuando se trata de combinar géneros. A pesar de mostrarse como una película densa y grotesca al principio, en realidad es una película de género muy convencional pero que aprovecha esta condición para hacer algo fresco, emocionante, original y, por supuesto, de una calidad inigualable. Con un ritmo casi formulado, Mitchell puede dejar su marca y su toque personal con planos que recuerdan su aclamada película anterior y un tono oscuro y paranoico en ciertos momentos que realmente te hacen creer que estás viendo un thriller de misterio de lo más denso. Todo acompañado por el gran Disasterpiece que trae con su música un ambiente que bordea lo ridículo, pero reafirma la condición de la película como una parodia del Thriller más clásico que puede existir.
Y la contribución de Andrew Garfield es, sin duda, invaluable también, demostrando ser un actor convincente y dedicado, algo que, si se hace bien, da excelentes resultados. En cuanto al contenido de la trama, que fácilmente puede considerarse una excusa para desarrollar un thriller ""inusual"", debo decir que si bien puedo estar de acuerdo con eso, es una trama llena de guiños, referencias y ataques a la cultura pop que pueden ser interpretado como un mensaje subliminal más dentro de la película, un mensaje que solo puede ser descifrado cuanto más lo revisamos y nos comprometemos a encontrar el significado de una historia tan extraña. Una película de los que a primera vista es divisiva, pero cuantas más veces la vemos, lo probable es que la valoremos más que al principio. Igual que con las buenas películas.",Under the Silver Lake

Regardless the protagonist (Andrew Garfield) whose almost a viewer himself just along for the ride except in real time is one of the movies real gems.

But because he was only a one hit wonder coming into this, I was skeptical.I will say this- this film is not for everyone. I can see it being a very polarizing movie. You either love it or you hate it. And for me, I loved it. Nobody does David Lynch as well as Lynch. But this film does the surreal feeling so well. Diving down the rabbit hole of the unknown.This film does leave me with many questions of certain things that were not answered (ex: what happened to the Owl's Kiss?).Once again, Mitchell left me with a film that is going to stick with me for a while.

It is about something that is explicitly mentioned: what if pop culture is just a vehicle to manipulate us, to alienate us, to keep us controlled and happy, not facing and fighting against the inequalities and the injustices? I think this movie is also about the present day youth, about the shallowness, about hedonism, about crazy conspiracy theories, about emptiness, about mythomania (yes, we all know that even rock stars are humans like we are, but we had never seen it so graphically, in such grotesque and so unpleasant way), about the rampant consume (Sam consumes girls. He ""falls in love"" with every girl he meets. He is not in love with Sarah, he is infatuated with her. Sarah is just a whim. He has to posses her, to consume her).

192,candice-l-clark,Indie art film that doesn't necessarily make sense but is thoroughly entertaining,9,20 April 2020,"I was thrilled to stumble across this film randomly. It has a really a cool feel to it and appeals to a number of themes I love in film: neo noir, homages to classics I love, L.A. being portrayed from a less glitzy angle and interesting characters going about their unusual lives. If you like indie art films which don't necessarily have a very well-developed plot then you may enjoy this, although I suspect people who need a film to 'make sense' will hate it. I feel like people of a certain generation (those who grew up in the 90s) might appreciate it more than others. The film is very original, but also pays tribute to noir classics and has a very Hitchcock-ian vibe to it (which is referenced a few times in the film).The protagonist is played perfectly by an odd, scruffy, Americanised Andrew Garfield who was great as Sam, the aimless loser looking for adventure who tries to solve the mystery of the disappearance of his glamorous neighbour. His investigation leads to the discovery of even more strange loose ends, but this trippy journey is thoroughly entertaining to watch and I was compelled by the characters and situations Sam found himself in.I highly recommend for like-minded viewers.",Under the Silver Lake

194,batmanorgiants,An underrated gem,10,9 March 2020,"When I first watched Under the Silver Lake I wasn't sure what to expect. I knew based off of critics and audiences reactions I would either love or hate the film but I wasn't sure why. And I think I can understand the reasonings now. You see, as opposed to many other neo-noir films, there is no true Definite end to the mystery and due to this it can leave the viewer unsatisfied. There also is little to no character development from any character but Sam and this is further heightened by the refusal of naming anyone other then our title character(for example, the girl that mysteriously disappears has no name given: she is just the beautiful neighbor). Now the excessive and arguably degrading usage of females in the film can be interpreted as sexist but I saw it's portrayal of women as a necessity to the overall narrative of the film. And what would that be? The concept of conspiracy as a whole. You see, in the film, one of sam's friends complains how due to the obsessive and technology based culture we live in now, there can be no true puzzle that can be examined by anyone since the answers are clear. And of course this is a tongue and cheek reference to the absurdity Sam finds himself in when solving the disappearance of this beautiful girl. The movie is incredibly ironic and has a deadpan humor to it that can admittedly be a bit obnoxious to a lot of people. I have no gripes with anyone that does not enjoy this film because one has the right to interpret this film as ""pretentious"". But I find it to be brilliant. Without spoiling anything, the climax of the film brought me to tears and the actual ending left me dumbfounded and speechless for a few hours. And of course, the film is held together by the brilliant acting from Andrew Garfield. Overall just an intelligent, insightful mystery film that was engaging and suspenseful from the opening scene to the finale.",Under the Silver Lake

It feels like they had all the ingredients to do a great movie, but somehow the director lost his idea on the way. Don't get me wrong, I enjoyed but I really had more expectations. By seeing this movie I realize the importance for a director to be a good storyteller, imagine Quentin Tarantino or David Fincher taking UTSL.

Any ratings above a 5 are surely posted by cast and crew or lonely, pretentious art-house students with nothing better to do after a hard day at school trying to decipher the collective works of David Lynch.
To be clear, this movie makes absolutely no sense and has you continuously asking yourself, what, when, where, who, but mostly, why. Be forewarned; there are absolutely no answers.
And to top it off, we are held hostage for almost two and a half excruciating hours, squirming uncomfortably as we continuously wrestle with thoughts of just cutting our losses and turning off our TV never to speak of this again.

Until a specific scene with a piano...then BOOM all that built up knowledge and understanding of Sam comes into play and you find urself watching a griping noir movie.

For my opinion, this is the key to understand this film : Sam is a lost, broken-hearted man who tries to seek some meaning in a world that doesn't have any. He's a modern Don Quichotte, fighting against the absurdity of a life without love. That's why he's looking for secret messages in pop songs or cereal boxes ; that's why he has meaningless sex and spends days trying to find a girl he doesn't really know. But at the end, he finally discovers the truth : there is no meaning to all of this. Sam seems in peace on the balcony, because he has accepted the fact that things sometimes happen without a purpose.
Overall very good film, severely underrated. Reminds me a lot about the work of David Lynch (Mulholland Drive) and the writings of Bret Easton Ellis (Less Than Zero).",Under the Silver Lake

At first this works, and the adaptation of noir thriller music and ambience to modern LA gels well. The murkiness of the plot somehow hangs together and the strange weirdness of the high society parties blend together well. About halfway through this starts to unravel though and the clear film references start to feel strained as the movie plot itself struggles to stand on its own. The hazy feeling of the protagonist being thrown from one encounter to the next works surprisingly well until we come to forced 'odd' dénouements which have no real content other than being out-there. Lynch's weirdness, even at its most gratuitous, has a firm conceptual vision underpinning it which this film lacks. It simply doesn't know how to end after ramping up the oddball intrigue, promising something or can't deliver and shouldn't try to. Without its own clear vision, the film's homage dissolves into imitation.",Under the Silver Lake

The kind of bad that begs the age old cinematic question - ""What were you thinking?"" - which brings me to my next line of inquiry - Was there anyone at the helm thinking about the outcome of this movie? How will it turn out? It's a run away train of bad ideas, one following the next. It's one thing to have a bad script, it's another and more unfortunate circumstance when no one called it out before it went into production, fascinating really.

My problem with this movie ( besides the fact that it last 2 hours 20 minutes) is that there are a lot of things that makes no sense , and there is no explanation of them, plus some scenes that doesn't add anything to the plot.Naturally , i went to IMDb to read some reviews , sometimes i miss something and there was an explanation after all, i didn't find anything so i decided to write one.for example : the drone scene where the two guys wait for the ""model"" girl to show up, it lasts way too long and it doesn't add anything, the girl is seen crying , and the characters doesn't seem to care.... Sam be like ... ok bye...During the movie i was checking my clock to see how much time left , since the movie kept introducing new ""characters"" , new ""clues"" and riddles and well after half-movie I started to realize that this movie was one of those movies that doesn't explain anything on the end.Since the beginning of the movie i noticed that there was a lot of women around, then on Sam's aparments we found (among other ""characters""):1) the topless bird lady (useless character that doesn't add anything , nor her birds)2) Sam's girlfriend (who came to visit him 2 times using costumes , for some reason, then dissappeared )3)Sarah (who had a dog , another thing that they didn't bother to explain or at least connect it to something) who invites Sam over to get high,then they get interrupted by the pirate guy ( another character that has no reason to exist and isnt explained) and two friends , while Sam walks next to them like he was invisible. then the firework scene ???? , wtf was that for?4) Owl succubus girl , who was this girl ? why did she exist? why the f did she run to the bedroom when Sam pointed his gun at her? and WHY THE HELL DID SAM LOOK FOR HER ON THE DRESSER DRAWER??? then the police woman knocks the door and the Owl girl is gone for the rest of the movie..5) the dog killer , was it even a character? what was the point? also, the barking girls ????? wtf?? i thought he was dreaming but it was real... another thing that they never gave an explanation about.6) the misterious chasing silhouette , who was that? they never bothered to explain who he was. also, when Sam escapes from him and reaches the aparment, he hides behind the bushes instead of going inside of his house??? 
7) the homeless king and homeless symbolism, why ? and why does this guy seems to be the gate keeper of the anti-bomb shelter? another thing that goes unexplained.then there is the stuff that made no sense and i laughed at:1) Google maps censorshipwhen Sam goes to this ""supersecret"" place that wasnt showing on satellite view , in the mountains near LA, all he finds is a 3-square meter hut made of wood and grass .. lmao
a group of hikers would have more chances to stumble upon that place than someone just looking around Google maps.2) the videocall tech...at this point i was laughing so hard .... "" so you wanna talk to Sarah ? yeah dont worry,we can call her by phone, because we have a phone inside this hut, and it includes HD videocalls too!""3) Sam spent the whole day chasing Sarah's friends to ask them about the girl.after hiding from them the whole day to avoid being seen , then the lake scene where the girls gave the pirate guy the box with Sarah dolls , then he runs away (for whatever reason ), then on the party , Sam decides its a good oportunity to confront said friends IN THE GIRLS BATHROOM...! the guy had a million times to ask them , one of them was right after the girl left Sarah apartment, but he had to spend a whole day chasing them on his Mustang , which he seems to be able to afford the gas for.

I was in Madrid and I had two hours to kill (the movie premiered in Spain before it did in the US so I knew nothing about it). It could be one of the happiest accidents I've had in a long time.
As the elements of the plot grew thicker and weirder, I kept asking myself -how the hell is the writer going to make sense of all this information? Shockingly, he does. I walked out of the film feeling exhilarated. As a screenwriter I thought it had some issues but it wasn't until I woke up the next morning that I finally understood how everything fell into place.
This is a movie about a young and handsome Hollywood wannabe on the verge of eviction, who embarks on a mysterious adventure to discover the fate of young and beautiful women who -just like him- dream big, but can't afford to live in Hollywood.
The film is filled with smart references to Hitchcock, de Palma and other masters of suspense, The music is amazing. The surreal mystery of the story is grounded in the real drama of young and beautiful people who soon realize that there's no gold pot waiting for them in Hollywood-and they can't even afford living in San Jose.
Thinking back about the film, the lines I found most memorable have nothing to do with the mystery, but with the real drama of the main character who is losing everything -his job, his home, his car, his status, his youth-, all buried in this weird magical adventure where almost every string -maybe all- are nicely tied at the end. The ending is beautiful and tragic: the main character ends up buried in the same place where the object of his desire is. That is the only possible happy ending for him-and for her.
I see many negative reviews here, but unfortunately they all seem to come from people who expect films to be purely entertaining, movie fans who are unfamiliar with the brilliant movie references the film presents. Can you call yourself a ""movie fan"" if you've never seen ""Rear Window"", really?
""Under the Silver Lake"" ends up been an indictment of the entertainment industry and its mesmerizing and devastating effect. If you look carefully, the real danger is not the mystery killer- is your own landlord.

In times of a surplus of options and diminshing attention spans, making a good movie choice has almost become a life skill. So we head to user reviews.Had I have read a couple of the negative reviews before watching, I would have certainly given this film a miss. Very fortunate of me to not have. There are so many negative reviews scoring this film a 0 or 1 that it would have been hard not be dubious. That's where I suppose the lesson comes in. This is obviously not a movie for everyone.

I'm sure there are some good scripts out there just waiting to be made and the fact that this film was made makes me question everyone involved with the project. First and foremost the director/writer. Feels like he spent a little too much time in Silver Lake LA smoking up a whole lotta weed and thinking this is a real interesting place, what if? And now we know the Silver Lake represented in the film is far from interesting, it's down right bland, empty, hollow and yearning for a creative spark, which is probably an insult to the people that inhabit the area.",Under the Silver Lake

There are holes in the plot, it's difficult to follow, very unrealistic. Uses sexual themes as a desperate attempt to make this movie decent.

285,garrettcraig-37044,So much potential,2,1 November 2019,But falls flat on its face. Ending was weird and confusing. The movie was way to long for a plot that felt empty. I feel bad for a good actor like Garfield to put his name on a film like this.

286,cosmicfilms11,This film has a lot to offer for those who are open to it.,8,2 May 2019,"I think you've gotta be in a certain type of mood to appreciate this movie. It's a slow-paced, meandering film that doesn't always resolve every single sub-plot fully. Some things are left unanswered and some viewers may not feel fully satisfied at the film's conclusion. But leaving a certain degree of ambiguity usually is something that I enjoy, if it's executed well and has a purpose. I think it most definitely has a purpose here and is executed perfectly. David Robert Mitchell manages to evoke something that is difficult to fully express in words, it's an odd blend of surrealism, comedy, mystery, horror, and social commentary. It has a very clear opinion of LA culture and the darker side of Hollywood. The climax of the film is fascinating, understated, and refreshing. For me, it was resolved in just the right way, considering the events of the previous two hours of the film. And even though it is a bit lengthy, it never over stayed its welcome. There were plenty of interesting plot points, excellent performances (especially Andrew Garfield), and unusual visuals to keep me constantly engaged. Substance is the word that I keep thinking of. This movie is rich in it's ideas and provides a lot to think about given you're in the right head space for it. For those who didn't like it I'd say give it another shot, maybe something will hit you in a different way on second viewing.",Under the Silver Lake

This is what I think happened to Under the Silver Lake. There is simply too much going on here and not enough developed so the effect is a movie that changes course so many times that you can't really sink your teeth into any of ideas.It has elements of noir in it that I really liked. I liked the idea of marketing companies inventing all of pop culture, even the anti-stuff and I liked the stuff about rich people at the end. It's a good detective movie and worth the watch.

It felt like this movie could be split into pieces which made for weird but funny and artsy shorts. But for a movie it felt like it was all over the place whitch made me impatient as to get to a point or keep track of any plotline. I do mind nudity but I got the feeling that feminism was set back a lot of years in terms of women just being used as beautiful prop or 'damsel in distress' that could only be desired or have any significant part, plus the male figures where, as usual more clothed. And a stereotypically white boy child (owns an appartment and car way above paygrade or job ). However the actor playes it well. A lot of scenes were too long and vague and could've been cut. Why the many parties (time stalling to me)? Liked the detective part, but also failed to be a strong plotline. Even the part about the Owl's kiss, was cut too short (didn't feel like it would end). Even the humorous bits could be more extreme. Be all out or not at all I would say and pick a plotline, stick to it or explain what it adds to the plot for people who do not know of all references visually.",Under the Silver Lake
305,ana-burda,Meh,6,3 October 2021,"It has a good atmosphere, especially in the first half. The soundtrack and visuals over all are really good. The plot starts off intriguing with some cool mysteries but ends up being a let down. My main gripe is that it seems the writer forgot that women are actually people. All the women characters in the film are either plot devices or shallow eye candy and all inexplicably attracted to the stinking (hid bad smell is mentioned multiple times throughout the film) dishevelled main character who's clothes look like he fished them out of a dumpster.Frankly, I can't understand why people praise it for being so unique either. Sure it is weird, but in my opinion The OA did unpredictable better, Brand New Cherry Flavor did weird better and The Neon Demon is a much more interesting film on the topic of Hollywood eating people alive.Over all 5 stars, + 2 stars for the excellent music and exceptional styling and costume design, -1 for the lazy presentation of women.",Under the Silver Lake

307,mereldegrauwe,What did I just watch?,9,26 August 2018,"Under the Silver Lake is the third feature film of upcoming director David Robert Mitchell. Mitchell already established his skills in creating atmospheric movies with 2014's It Follows: a clear homage to 80's horror films. And with his new movie it's obvious that he dared to drift even further from the classic hollywood style of filmmaking.Under the Silver Lake is not an easy movie to digest and will probably not be appreciated by the general public, nor does it need to be. It's clear that Mitchell creates movies out of passion (as the best directors do), and after the success of It Follows he became more bold and as a result was able to create a truely bizzare piece of cinema that reminds us of movies like Enemy (Denis Villeneuve), Donnie Darko (Richard Kelly) and the most obvious: Mullholland Drive (David Lynch).Sam is a lonely, miserable and in the end quite unlikable guy living in L.A. After a neighbour girl who he became enamoured with dissapears, Sam becomes obsessed with finding out what happened to her. The search for the truth reveals more and more weird secrets along the way. Including the disappearance of furniture, a dog killer and hidden messages in the media. 
If you're looking for a movie with an easy plot that will give you all the answers in the end, this movie isn't for you. Many of the plot elements don't get resolved or explained, but when looking at the movie as a whole, this is not a problem. In my humble opinion it just adds tot he overal weirdness and atmosphere of paranoia that the movie is meant to give way to. By far the most striking element of this movie is, however, the unique style. The cinematography has some expertly used neo-noir elements, adding to the detective atmosphere of the movie. Furthermore, it's obvious that Mitchell is selective in the shots being used in the movie. Only a minimal amount of shots are used to tell the tale, leading to a very clean-cut look. The movie has some unique camera movements but those are sparsely used as well, contrasting strongly with the otherwise simple camerawork. Because of this, those special camera movements stand out more and really serve their purpose. The use of music and sound elements is also quite striking: in particular the use of mickey mousing, to often compliment the previously mentioned unique camerawork. Overal Under the Silver Lake is a beautiful piece of cinema that might not be what the average film goer is looking for, but cinephiles will probably appreciate for it's distinct uniqueness and surprisingly well mashed up uses of different stylistic choices.",Under the Silver Lake

This movie follows the a few days of a young guy in his twenties who drifts through the day watching TV shows and mastubating or peeping tomming on his female neighbours. His L.A. neighbourhood is haunted by a mysterious dog killer. He stumbles upon a comic book about him, and so begins his journey into a dark hidden underworld of Los Angeles. When one of his neighbours he has a crush on disappears, he cannot stop following up on his paranoias and drug related conspiracy dreams, which start to become true.
This movie is great because you never know what crazy thing might happen next and many quirky characters appear on his path.
