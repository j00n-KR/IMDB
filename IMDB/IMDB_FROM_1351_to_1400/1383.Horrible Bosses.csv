0,TheLittleSongbird,Great cast and premise in a very well done film,8,9 September 2011,"The cast and premise were what drew me into Horrible Bosses in the first place and while they are the main excellent things about the film Horrible Bosses succeeds in many other ways too. The film is photographed and edited beautifully and with precision, and Horrible Bosses also boasts a driven soundtrack and efficient direction, as well as a sharp and witty script, a compelling story that lives up to its great premise and well observed characters. The cast give their all, I thought Kevin Spacey was the standout, however Colin Farrell and Charlie Day were also excellent and I don't think I have seen Jennifer Aniston better than she was here. Overall, a very well done film that serves its cast and premise well. 8/10 Bethany Cox",Horrible Bosses
1,SnoopyStyle,Some stupid hilarity,7,1 January 2014,"Three friends have horrible bosses, and try to get rid of them. Nick (Jason Bateman) is in sales hoping for a promotion, but his boss Dave (Kevin Spacey) steals his job for himself. Dale (Charlie Day) has a boss Julia (Jennifer Aniston) who's sexually harassing him. Kurt (Jason Sudeikis) has a nice boss, but he dies and leaves the company to his douche son Bobby (Colin Farrell).It's a bit too serious at times. The stupidity gets a little funny. There are some hilarious moments. Charlie Day's manic idiocy can be very annoying and very funny. Sometimes it's both at the same time. In the end, the guys are just likable enough. The humor is just silly enough. It's a good comedy that breaks out every once in a while.",Horrible Bosses
2,Horst_In_Translation,"Delightful watch, quite funny",6,3 February 2016,"""Horrible Bossses"" is an American 105-minute comedy movie from 5 years ago and as the title already tells us it is about a trio of truly unbearable bosses. Well, actually it is really more about the poor souls working under them and the bosses are really only the supporting players even if almost all the actions of their employees revolve around them. And the bosses are also played by the more famous actors, namely Colin Farrell, Kevin Spacey and Jennifer Aniston as you have never seen her before. The employees are played by Jason Bateman (""Arrested Development""), who is nice to watch as always, Jason Sudeikis, who I do not really care about, and Charlie Day (""Always Sunny""), who is at least as funny here as on his regular show. Other minor supporting players include Julie Bowen (""Modern Family""), Oscar winner Jamie Foxx and Donald Sutherland.I thought this was quite a funny film and occasionally I was even tempted to give this one a 4/5 rating, but the moments of true comedic greatness weren't frequent enough as a whole. All in all, it was a very well-crafted film. The introduction to the 3 scenarios was as good as the elaboration on them until we finally find out that the three employees are friends. The murder plot was pretty absurd of course, but nonetheless an interesting idea to keep the film rolling. It never dragged for me. To me, it was especially fun to watch Kevin Spacey go full a**hole as a ruthless boss (even more than on ""House of Cards"" season 1) and human being, who becomes a cold-blooded murderer as well after he suspects his wife of cheating on him.""Horrible Bosses"" was a commercial success as well, so that they made a sequel a couple years later. I heard it is not as good as the original, but I will probably check that one out as well at some point. As for this first film here, it was definitely a positive surprise and I would count it under the best comedy films from 2011. Some very funny moments and good acting from pretty much everybody involved. Occasionally it reminded me a bit of ""The Hangover"" in terms of the comedic contents and general style of the film. So if you enjoyed that Golden Globe winner, give ""Horrible Bosses"" a chance. You will not be disappointed.",Horrible Bosses

4,claudio_carvalho,A Silly Comedy that Occasionally Makes the Viewer Laugh,6,13 December 2011,"Nick Hendricks (Jason Bateman), Dale Arbus (Charlie Day) and Kurt Buckman (Jason Sudeikis) have been friends for a long time and they usually have happy hour together. Nick is an ambitious employer that has been working for eight years in the same company and expects to be promoted to Sales Vice President by his boss Dave Harken (Kevin Spacey). Dale is a dental assistant that expects to marry his beloved fiancée; however, he is sexually harassed by his boss, Dr. Julia Harris, D.D.S. (Jennifer Aniston). The womanizer Kurt and his boss Jack Pellit (Donald Sutherland) are great friends and he will be assigned to be the manager of the family business where he works; however, Jack has a heart attack and dies and his cocaine addicted son Bobby Pellitt (Colin Farrell) assumes the company and he and Kurt hate each other.One day, the three friends are drinking beer and talking to each other their problems with their bosses and they conclude that they can not quit their jobs due to the economical crisis. However, they decide to plot a scheme to get rid off their bosses. Nick, Dale and Kurt seek out a hit-man to kill their bosses in a dangerous neighborhood and they get in trouble with the police. ""Horrible Bosses"" is a silly comedy that occasionally makes the viewer laugh. Kurt and Dale are complete imbeciles and not funny. The beautiful and sexy Jennifer Aniston is miscast since I can not imagine any man (with the exception of Brad Pitt) that could resist to her harassment. Julia Hams should be an actress not hot like Jennifer Aniston. Kevin Spacey, Jamie Foxx, the unrecognizable Colin Farrell, Jason Bateman and Jennifer Aniston are responsible for the funniest moments of this uneven comedy. The jokes with ""Strangers on a Train"", ""Throw Momma from the Train"" and ""Snow Falling on Cedars"" are also funny. My vote is six.Title (Brazil): ""Quero Matar Meu Chefe"" (""I Want to Kill My Boss"")",Horrible Bosses
5,nogodnomasters,PLEASE STAY WITH YOUR VEHICLE,8,22 August 2018,"Three friends have horrible bosses. For one reason or another they are stuck at their jobs. Nick works for Kevin Spacey who is a ridiculous driver and badgers Nick when he is 2 minutes late. Kurt works a chemical company. His new boss is a coke head who sees the business as an ATM machine and wants to run it into the ground. When he says he wants to ""trim the fat"" that means he wants to fire fat people. Dale, who is engaged, is a dental assistant to Jennifer Aniston, who wants to have sex with him. Even his close friends have trouble believing that is a problem.Kurt claims killing his boss, who wants to dump waste on the proverbial poor Bolivians would save lives and that they have a moral duty to kill their boss. Jennifer Aniston develops a comical potty mouth in this film, one that makes Madonna sound like Mother Teresa.After some very brief soul searching our trio decides life would be better without their bosses. However getting to that point is not easy. The movie takes some unexpected twists. The role of Dale (Charlie Day) was clearly written with Zach Galifianakis in mind. In spite of that, this was still an excellent movie. Good laughs, and an enjoyment to see Aniston as ""R"" rated.F-bomb, crude sex talk (mostly by Aniston)",Horrible Bosses
6,kosmasp,Over the top,8,22 January 2012,"I'm not only referring to the plot, but also to our ""über-villains"" on display here. It's obvious that Jennifer Aniston (first time I see her as evil as in this one) and Colin Farrell having a field day. Kevin Spacey has done similar things before, but that doesn't take anything away from his performance here.As always with comedies, quite a lot of the gags have been used for the trailer. The good news is however that there are still a lot of jokes in here, that work and haven't been used in the trailers. So while it would be good to not have seen the trailer, even if you have seen it, you will find this highly amusing.What I cannot understand however is, how they thought this should get a sequel (see IMDb, though only pro users have access to additional information at this moment). Of course the movie was successful, but still it should remain a one-off.",Horrible Bosses
7,Sleepin_Dragon,"Really funny, original.",8,22 August 2018,"I'm sure this movie hits home with many of us, who can say we've never had a bad boss, or a horrible teacher? We've all had to answer to someone despicable.Some truly funny moments, the main trio of actors are great, with Jennifer Aniston displaying her true comic brilliance, as well as looking sensational, such a versatile talent. Charlie Day was great as the goofy fuzzball, but best laughs came from Jamie Foxx and Ioan Gruffudd. Two very different parts for each to play.Hollywood has come up with some good, and some awful comedies over the last few years, Horrible Bosses is one of the better ones. 8/10",Horrible Bosses
8,lee_eisenberg,"misery's no life, but it makes for a hilarious movie",9,8 April 2015,"Sort of a modern spin on ""9 to 5"", ""Horrible Bosses"" is partly about the main characters' plot to murder their bosses, but the supporting characters are also really funny. This movie, along with ""Glengarry Glen Ross"" and ""Swimming with Sharks"", proves that Kevin Spacey is the perfect person to cast as a sleazeball employer (he plays basically the same role in ""Hurlyburly""). It's one of those movies that sets up things to happen, just so that the viewer has the pleasure of watching the characters find out (such as the deal with the phone).True, a lot of the humor is sophomoric, but I was laughing every step of the way. Jennifer Aniston gets to play against type in the role of a nymphomaniac dentist; her character is enough to drive anyone nuts. And then there's Colin Farrell's character: that guy made my skin crawl. Appearing briefly is Julie Bowen (Claire on ""Modern Family"") as Kevin Spacey's wife.Long story short, it's one of the funniest movies of the past few years. Seth Gordon later directed the equally funny ""Identity Thief"".",Horrible Bosses
9,jboothmillard,Horrible Bosses,5,24 February 2013,"I had seen the poster for this film so many times that I was getting annoyed that I hadn't seen it, because it has such a good list of stars in the cast, I had no idea about the plot apart from clips I had seen from trailers so I was looking forward to watching it, from director Seth Gordon (Four Christmases). Basically Nick Hendricks (Jason Bateman) hates his boss Dave Harken (Kevin Spacey) in his financial firm because he is a sadistic, power-crazed bully who keeps tricking him into thinking he is up for a promotion he wants; Kurt Buckman (Hall Pass's Jason Sudeikis) hates his boss Bobby Pellitt (Colin Farrell) in his family owned chemical company because he is insensitive, addicted to cocaine, and his father Jack Pellitt (Donald Sutherland) was a nice man until he was killed; and Dale Arbus (Charlie Day) hates his boss Dr. Julia Harris, D.D.S. (Jennifer Aniston) at the dentist surgery because he is engaged and she is sexually harassing him, demanding that he sleeps with her, and threatening to his fiancée that they slept together if he doesn't. The three men are good friends, and one night they are simply joking around at the idea of killing their horrible bosses, Dale is the first to say that he actually wants to do it, and Nick and Kurt agree to this as well, they obviously do not want to do it themselves though. They are just three ordinary guys, so they have no idea how to hire the services of a hit-man, and their first attempt to do so from an advertisement on the internet goes wrong when Wetwork Man (Ioan Gruffudd) shows up, and it turns out he is a male prostitute who pisses on people for money, this is the ""wet work"". They are directed by navigation-system operator Gregory, real and unpronounceable Atmanand (Brian George) to a bar that is supposed to be full of criminals, and there they meet and pay a supposed hit-man who calls himself Dean 'Motherfucker' Jones (Jamie Foxx), after he caught his mother having sex, who advises they should use movies like Strangers on a Train and Throw Momma from the Train as a guide in how to swap murders of their bosses. They are told that the deaths should look like accidents, so one by one Nick, Kurt and Dale break into their bosses' houses to find out more about more about them, such as habits and potential ways to cause a convincing accident, incriminate them or of course kill them, this includes finding samples of cocaine, wiping toothbrushes and razors between their butt cheeks, and finding cell phones. During these break-ins they cause unintentional mistakes, such as breaking and spilling things, leaving behind things that would mean being arrested if identified from DNA evidence, at one point Dale almost unknowingly kills Harken when he has an allergic reaction to peanuts, and Jones admits he is not actually a hit-man. Doing this however does cause some unexpected events, including Harken who shoots Pellitt right at his front door, this is because his cellphone, dropped by Kurt, was found by Harken at his house, and he assumed wrongly that Pellitt was having some kind of affair with his wife, and Dale is sure that he can get Julia off his back by agreeing to have sex with her. With Pellitt murdered Nick, Kurt and Dale know that they can get of Harken by getting his arrested for the crime, so they take a recording device so they can record him confessing to the killing, but he catches on to this plan at his surprise birthday party, and when it looks like they are the next victims the police rescue them, and Gregory in the car recorded Harken's voice threatening them. In the end Harken is sentenced to twenty five years in prison for murder and Nick is promoted to company president, Kurt keeps his job and gets a new nice boss Lou Sherman (Bob Newhart) who may have a dark side, and Dale blackmails Julia to end the harassment by having Jones secretly recording her harassing a supposedly unconscious patient and threatening he will get her fired if she tries anything. Also starring Lindsay Sloane as Stacy and Julie Bowen as Rhonda Harken. Bateman, Sudeikis and Day are great choices as the men who cannot stand their bosses for equally unbearable reasons, Spacey is suitably cruel and vicious, Farrell is alright but not really on much, Aniston is for once really good playing the opposite to anything you would be used to from her being a beautiful nymphomaniac bitch, and with his time on screen Foxx is cool as the dodgy lawbreaker. The story is exactly like one of those classic murder-swap films, with three slightly boozy but career conscious chums, the plot is easy to follow and you can find so much of the material really funny, I personally found it mostly hilarious and I don't know why the critics gave it a low rating, in my opinion a fun black comedy. Worth watching!",Horrible Bosses
10,Tweekums,Pretty funny but not for everybody,7,25 September 2018,"Nick, Kurt and Dale are three friends working for bosses who make their lives a misery. Nick's boss, Dave Harken works him hard with the promise of a promotion that never materialises; Dale, a dental assistant is sexually harassed by dentist Julia Harris and Dave's new boss is running down the business to fuel his drug habit. Eventually they can take it no more and decide their bosses have to die. Attempts to find a hitman don't go well but eventually they decide to kill each other's bosses. Inevitably it isn't quite as easy as they thought.As the characters acknowledge the basic plot is 'Strangers on a Train'/'Throw Momma from the Train'... being a comedy more of the latter. The premise is simple enough and it does provide a good number of laughs; it also manages to get near the knuckle at times as certain situations could offend some viewers... if Dale and Julia's positions had been reversed I'm sure it wouldn't have been allowed. The characters are a fun bunch; each of the bosses is unsympathetic in nicely varied ways and the three protagonists are amusingly incompetent when it comes to planning a murder. The cast is solid with Jason Bateman, Charlie Day and Jason Sukeikis being amusing leads; Jennifer Aniston, Kevin Spacey and Colin Farrell are equally fun as the titular Horrible Bosses... particularly Aniston who plays against type as the sexually predatory dentist. There is also a very funny turn from Jamie Foxx as the trio's 'murder adviser'. Overall I found this to be pretty funny but some of the material is likely to offend some viewers.",Horrible Bosses
11,BA_Harrison,Consistently amusing throughout.,7,6 December 2014,"Have you ever wondered what adorable 'Friend' and rom-com favourite Jennifer Aniston would be like as a domineering, slutty, sexual predator? Yeah, me too.In Horrible Bosses, we get the opportunity to find out, for the lovely actress gets down and dirty as a reprehensible dentist who makes life very uncomfortable for her male assistant Dale (Charlie Day), pestering him for sex at every available opportunity. While that might not sound all that horrible to you and I, Dale isn't happy with his boss's behaviour; his best buds Nick (Jason Bateman) and Kurt (Jason Sudeikis) also have very good reasons to hate their own bosses (played by Colin Farrell and Kevin Spacey), and so, while out for a drink, the three pals decide that it might be a good idea if they got rid of their problematic superiors once and for all.The plot for this unsophisticated comedy might just be a comedic spin on Hitchcock's classic thriller Strangers On A Train (which gets referenced here), but it it's still a winner thanks to fun performances from a solid cast, and a script that, while not laugh out loud all the way through, provides more than enough decent chuckles for a good time. Bateman, Sudeikis and Day make for a likable trio of dopes, but it is Aniston, Farrell and Spacey who are most memorable, Aniston for being so incredibly sexy, Farrell for being so utterly sleazy, and Spacey for being such a total tosser.",Horrible Bosses
12,paul_haakonsen,What was all the hype about?...,4,25 September 2011,"There was a lot of hype around this movie, and I must admit that it had caught my interesting, so I was looking forward to seeing the movie.And now that I have seen it, I must say that I feel somewhat cheated. That the hype was all for nothing. Don't get me wrong, I am not saying that this is a bad or boring movie, not by a long shot. The movie just wasn't all that I expected it to be.The storyline is pretty good; you have three friends Nick (played by Jason Bateman), Kurt (played by Jason Sudeikis) and Dale (played by Charlie Day) who all have these mean, wicked, horrible bosses (hence the title of the movie, clever, eh?). They come up with an ill-planned scheme to kill their bosses and rid themselves of their tormentors. But of course, things doesn't turn out as planned.For a comedy, I found myself lacking laughs. There were only a single time or two times throughout the movie that I was laughing. Sure, the movie did bring about a lot of smiles, but in general it wasn't over-the-top funny. Which was a shame, because the movie could really have been so much more.What did work for the movie, was the impressive cast. All three main characters were played by some really good actors; Jason Bateman, Jason Sudeikis and Charlie Day. And the people who played their tormenting bosses, well that was the most impressive. You had Jennifer Anniston in the role of Dr. Julia Harris, a sex-crazed nympho. It was kind of surreal to see her in this role, but it worked out quite well. You had Colin Farrell in the role of Bobby Pellitt, a man over the hill, but still believing he was all that and a bag of chips. And finally you had Kevin Spacey in the role of Dave Harken, a scrupulous company boss, bent of slave-driving his workers. There were also a handful of good appearances by other great actors, for example Donald Sutherland in the role of Jack Pellitt and Ioan Gruffudd as Wetwork Man and Jamie Foxx as Dean 'MF' Jones. All these amazing actors/actresses really came together for a marvelous performance that carried the movie far.I just wish there had been more comedy in the movie, at least the style of comedy that I liked. But of course, we are all different people, with different likes and dislikes. The movie just didn't deliver what I had expected it to, so it was a somewhat lukewarm experience for me.",Horrible Bosses
13,blanche-2,"some excellent acting, some funny sequences",6,14 September 2016,"I'll watch Jason Bateman in anything, so I watched ""Horrible Bosses"" from 2011. Besides Bateman, the cast includes Kevin Spacey, Colin Farrell, Jennifer Aniston, Jason Sudeikis, and Donald Sutherland.Three best friends hate their jobs. At a brokerage firm, Nick (Bateman) works his fingers to the bone for his boss (Spacey) who dangles a big promotion over his head if he can stop coming in two minutes late. Then Nick doesn't get it. Jason Sudeikis is Kurt, who loved his job until his boss (Sutherland) dies suddenly, leaving his cokehead son Bobby (Pellit) in charge. Bobby tells Kurt the place is just one big ATM for him and he plans on milking it dry.Then he orders Kurt to fire a fat woman and a man in a wheelchair. Salt of the earth. And Charlie (Dale Arbus) is a dental assistant constantly being sexually harassed by his sexy boss Julia, played by a very hot brunette Jennifer Aniston. Charlie's engaged, and Julia holds the threat of telling his fiancé that Charlie is sleeping with her (which he isn't) if he doesn't come across.They decide the only thing they can do is kill their bosses. The three hire a hit man (Jamie Foxx), so they think, but after he takes $5000 he tells them he can only be a consultant because he can't go back to prison. He suggests that they do one another's murders so suspicion won't fall on them.It's easier than it sounds, and things go from bad to worse when a home invasion leads to coke being inhaled as it flies through the air, an allergy attack, a suspicious husband, a shooting they witness, and other things that get in their way.There are some hilarious scenes and some great dialogue in this film, and the acting is outstanding. Both Aniston and Farrell are not recognizable and in different roles than they usually play. They are both terrific. Bateman has his usual great delivery, and Spacey is excellent as one mean, horrible boss.There was also some vulgarity to appeal to the lowest common denominator, and that's why I don't like today's comedies. However, I did like this one for many reasons. The characters are well- developed and become involved in bizarre circumstances - usually of their own making. And don't miss the outtakes at the end.",Horrible Bosses

16,studioAT,Crewd but strangely enjoyable,1,28 August 2011,Horrible Bosses won't be everyone's type of film. Yes it does contain slightly more sexual references than I feel comfortable with and yes there is a fair amount of foul language that is off-putting (and really just not needed) but strip away all of that and by and large this is a fairly enjoyable film.A lot was made of Jennifer Aniston's role in this film and while her character is a mile away from what we've seen before she really isn't that great in this film and anyone could have played the role.It is the three male leads who make this film and their banter helps it to flow at a nice pace. The whole film is far-fetched but if you just accept that you should have no problem understanding this film.At two hours the film is too long and the premise cannot hold out that long. The end is rushed and dry but by and large the film serves it's purpose. It's certainly not all about Aniston though.,Horrible Bosses

19,zardoz-13,Politically Incorrect But Above-Average Hilarity,8,24 July 2011,"""Horrible Bosses"" qualifies as hilarious hokum from fade-in to fade-out. Of course, this imaginative but subversive R-rated comedy of errors about premeditated murder is not designed for everybody. If you can tolerate neither profanity nor homicide, then this laugh-fest may not be appropriate fare. Conversely, if you have or have had a boss who deserved a slow death, ""Horrible Bosses"" could make you laugh instead of wallow in your homicidal tendencies. The biggest joke of ""Horrible Bosses,"" which truly lives up to its descriptive title, is that the heroes behave like The Three Stooges. Imagine a parody of Alfred Hitchcock's ""Strangers on a Train,"" except our wannabe killers lack the nerve to go for the jugular. They don't have any murderous bones in their collective bodies. Most contemporary Hollywood thrillers feature one chief villain, but ""Horrible Bosses"" boasts three! Two are male, but one is female, while our protagonists are all men. ""Horrible Bosses"" contains many amusing scenes, especially when Nick hurls his boss out of a skyscraper. ""Identity Thief"" director Seth Gordon gives us a jolt every now and then with pussycats that burst out of nowhere to startle Nick and Kurt.Nick Hendricks (Jason Bateman), Dale Arbus (Charlie Day), and Kurt Buckman (Jason Sudeikis) all suffer the agonies of the damned as they tangle hopelessly with their respective bosses, Dave Harkin (Kevin Spacey of ""Superman Returns""), Dr. Julia Harris, D.D.S. (Jennifer Aniston of ""Rock Star""), and Bobby Pellit (Colin Farrell of ""Miami Vice""). Clearly the worst of the three, Harkin qualifies as a smiling sadist with a streak of misanthropy. When he isn't terrorizing poor Nick, Harken believes that his wife Rhonda (Julie Bowen of ""Amy's Orgasm"") is having sex with everybody but him. Incidentally, Rhonda may be cuckolding Harken because she has quickie bathroom sex with Kurt during Harken's surprise birthday party. Aniston plays a sexy but unscrupulous dentist who takes advantage of Dale, her male dental assistant who is a registered sex offender. Meanwhile, Sudeikis deals with a total swine of a boss who is a cokehead. Colin Farrell stretches the most as an actor here because he looks nothing like he typically does in movies. Here Farrell wears a sculpted beard and has his hair thinned out so he looks like he is losing his hair.After our woebegone protagonists have put up with far too much abuse, they locate an African-American, Dean 'MF' Jones (Jamie Fox of ""Miami Vice""), who is on parole. Initially, they think that he will terminate their bosses with extreme prejudice. One of the running jokes is the use of Dean's profane nickname that our heroes use in the most casual way. Anyway, 'MF' refuses to commit the killings for them, but he agrees to serve as their ""murder consultant"" for $5000. At the time, our foolish protagonists believed 'MF' pulled a 10 year stretch in the big house for murder. One of the surprises of ""Horrible Bosses"" is that Dean wasn't convicted of murder. He did time because the authorities caught him in a movie theater with a video camera recording a film! Nevertheless, 'MR' tells our hapless trio: ""Most killers are first-timers. You wanna pull off a brilliant murder; you gotta act like it's an accident. Failed brakes, gas leaks, suicide. You do it right, you ain't even gotta be there when it goes down."" Sounds like 'MR' saw the Charles Bronson hit-man movie ""The Mechanic"" because the Bronson character staged each hit as if it were an accident. Hendricks remains skeptical about MR's advice: ""Sounds like Scooby-Doo. How are we supposed to fake three accidents?"" Our heroes are naturally disappointed by 'MF's lack of participation. According to 'MF,' they must ""stalk their prey."" Second, he continues: ""Gotta be smart. Find out where they live, find out their habits. What's their hobbies?"" Nevertheless, 'MR' warns them if they have motives that the 'popo' will find them. Nick points out, ""We all have clear motives for killing our bosses, . . .so this is not gonna work. This is garbage."" 'MF' suggests they ""kill each other's bosses."" This is when Kurt alludes to Hitchcock's ""Strangers on a Train."" Dale hasn't seen ""Strangers on a Train,"" but he has seen the Danny DeVito movie ""Throw Momma from a Train."" ""We kill each other's bosses, there's no link to us,"" Kurt observes.During the remainder of ""Horrible Bosses,"" comedy galore ensues, particularly while Hendricks and Buckman are in Dave Harken's house, and dimwitted Dale Arbus (Charlie Day of ""Pacific Rim"") sits parked outside the house. Harken surprises Dale after the latter has littered and reprimands him for littering. Harken catches a whiff of peanuts and collapses helpless to the pavement, and witless Dale struggles to save Harken's life without realizing who Dave is. Everybody gets their just comeuppance, especially Julia. Director Seth Gordon and his scenarists do an exemplary job of foreshadowing what occurs later in this politically incorrect comedy. One of the biggest surprises occurs outside Bobby's house while Nick is watching Kurt's boss. Donald Sutherland has a brief bit as Kurt's boss. The ending with Nick meeting his new boss, Mr. Sherman (Bob Newhart), is really funny. ""Horrible Bosses"" never stops spouting jokes.",Horrible Bosses
20,grantss,Great fun,7,24 October 2015,"Far better than I expected. On the surface it looked like a typical juvenile comedy. Also, it stars Jennifer Aniston, so you know it's going to be fairly shallow. However, it turns out to be hilariously funny, with some great comedic performances. Plot is decent, direction is fluid, though there are scenes which seem overly slapsticky or contrived. Performances are mostly spot-on.

A Funny Comedy for Adults,8,21 December 2011,"Those who think Hollywood is no longer capable of creating a funny comedy for adults need not worry, as ""Horrible Bosses"" is proof that that increasingly rare phenomenon can still happen.""Horrible Bosses"" is one of those comedies like the classic ""Ruthless People,"" in which an outrageous and dark premise works because of good writing and an ensemble that knows exactly how to handle the material for maximum comedic value. Jason Bateman, Jason Sudeikis and Charlie Day play the requisite straight man, alpha male and dumbass, respectively, that male buddy comedies need, while Kevin Spacey, Jennifer Aniston and Colin Farrell (sadly underused) play the titular bosses. All of them have a field day with their roles, and Aniston especially stands out because of the film's decision to cast her against type as a slutty, foul-mouthed sex kitten; you can almost hear Aniston sighing with relief as she gets to play something other than the cute-as-a-button girl next door.As with most comedies, whether or not you think ""Horrible Bosses"" is funny will probably depend simply on whether or not you think the actors are funny. Charlie Day, for example, will likely drive some people crazy -- I thought he was hilarious.Grade: A",Horrible Bosses

Goldstein superbly balances over exaggerated physical comedy with blunt & edgy one-liners,which go from the guys attempts to invade Bobby Pellit's house ending in a cloud of nose candy,whilst they each soon discover that their Sat Nav has a mind of its own.Along with the hilarious Comedy hits,the writers also give the second half of the title a surprisingly dark twist,which leads to this being a horrible,but very funny gang of bosses.",Horrible Bosses
23,anaconda-40658,Not Horrible.,9,29 July 2015,"Horrible Bosses (2011): Dir: Seth Gordon / Cast: Jason Bateman, Charlie Day, Jason Sudeikis, Jennifer Aniston, Kevin Spacey: Corporate comedy that deals with fantasies that was the subject in another comedy masterpiece Nine to Five. Three males are tired of abuse taking from their bosses, and plot to have them murdered. Jason Bateman is constantly abused by his tyrant boss, played by Kevin Spacey, who offers him a drink early in the day then accuses him of having a drinking problem. After being passed up a promotion, he decides he has had enough. Charlie Day plays a dental assistant who is sexually harassed by his boss, played by Jennifer Aniston. He is engaged yet she threatens to blackmail him into sex through photos she had conjured up. Jason Sudeikis loved his boss until he had a heart attack leaving him under ruling of his boss's cocaine addicted son who is a creep in every way. In some ways this film comes off in poor tastes in its hateful relationships, yet viewers will find much to relate. Director Seth Gordon previously made the horrible Four Christmases. Here he directs a film that is horrible in title only. What works is that the screenplay builds on the agony of the three individuals, gradually forces them into a position where they decide to hired a hit-man. This in itself backfires hilariously leaving them to find ways to deal with their situation, which only gets worse and funnier. Even the plot solution is clever in that revenge is somewhat avoided. While there is great bosses out there, this great comic achievement concentrates on the complains, the hours and the nightmares. Score: 9 / 10",Horrible Bosses
24,HotToastyRag,"Funny, but a little raunchy",6,12 June 2017,"Either Jennifer Aniston was still tied to the Faustian contract that forced her to work with Adam Sandler, or she was ridiculously determined to shed her FRIENDS image. Sure, that makes sense. Take the role that made you a millionaire and one of the most popular actresses in America, a household name, a hair and fashion icon, and gave you a decades-long career, and do everything you can to tear that image to shreds.Anyway, Jennifer Aniston's filthy sex-crazed character in Horrible Bosses aside, it's not the worst movie in the world. Parts of it are pretty funny, if you like raunchy comedies. I look at it as the male, much filthier version of 9 to 5. Three unhappy friends plot to ""get rid of"" their horrible bosses. However, those who saw the original in the theater probably won't like this version; it has the distinct air of being aimed at the under-50 crowd.Kiddy Warning: Obviously, you have control over your own children.

But Dale is on the list of child offenders so he can't quit.Kurt actually likes his job and his boss, up until his boss dies and the boss's coked-out, psychopathic son takes over.But who could quit their jobs in such poor economic times? Instead Nick, Dale and Kurt drunkenly and hypothetically discuss how to kill their bosses, and before they know it, they've hired a murder consultant to help......Up until the last half an hour, I thought it was another one of those movies where all the best jokes are in the trailers. It was going along good, but it just wasn't as funny as I expected it to be, or wanted it to be.It wasn't the cast, they are really good, and the three bosses are simply some of the best characters in a comedy this year. Spacey can do this in his sleep, as anyone who has seen swimming with sharks know, but Farrell and Aniston are the standouts here.But as I have said, nothing really happens in the film, and then toward the end of the second act, something truly shocking happens, and then the film finds the dark side that was trying to get out previous, and becomes one of the best comedies of the year.It's little touches like this that make it more worthwhile than other comedies, it doesn't go for gross, it knows what the film is about and sells it well because of character development. You actually care for these guys, because work takes up the majority of your life,and what could be worse than having the titular boss? It's laugh out loud funny, and seeing actors such as Foxx (who's anecdote about why he went to prison is hilarious) and Ioan Gruffaund (who has the cameo of the year) go against type for such a small role.Just stick with the film and enjoy the last 30 minutes, which really makes the film.",Horrible Bosses
26,zetes,"Uneven, but Day and Aniston are hilarious",6,20 November 2011,"I almost want to recommend this comedy, because at times it can be absolutely hilarious. The problem is that it's so uneven. So many jokes just completely flop. Jason Bateman, Jason Sudeikis and Charlie Day star as three guys who can't stand their bosses. Bateman's is Kevin Spacey, a control freak who basically tortures him all day. Sudeikis has Colin Farrell, a cokehead who undeservedly runs the company after his father (Donald Sutherland, briefly) has a heart attack. And Day has Jennifer Aniston, a dentist who sexually harasses him throughout his shifts as her assistant. The three buddies get together and decide to do a Strangers on a Train thing. Now, the big thing is that the Day/Aniston storyline is far, far more hilarious than the other two situations. If you don't know Charlie Day, you should, because he's one of the funniest people on Earth. He's best known for his role on It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia. He probably doesn't have a lot of range, as his character here is just a less stupid version of his Charlie Kelly from Sunny, but who cares? That character is great, and Day is hilarious here. Aniston, too, matches him with her cougar act (she particularly likes to talk dirty while she operates on gassed patients). Its her best role in years - she can be so damn good it's depressing that she's always in such crap. Bateman and Sudeikis are both fine, but they only really work well when Day is in the mix (the three of them together have good comic chemistry). Spacey and Farrell fare worst, as neither of them are given too interesting a character. Spacey has played this role better in Swimming with Sharks. Jamie Fox has a great supporting role as a guy named ""Mofo"" Jones (except, obviously, the full word), whom the guys consult on their intended crime. Most of the funniest gags are Day's, and hopefully this will land him a leading role in a comedy film.",Horrible Bosses

The premise is three best friends from growing up decide to kill their unsavory bosses like Spacey and Jennifer Aniston who plays a predatory dentist on Charlie Day. Spacey drives Bateman's character crazy. The film begins okay and you think it's going to get better but it doesn't overall. After 90 minutes or so, the film comes to a predictable conclusion. The film has a great cast but the humor in the writing doesn't come across to me. I think the film could have used more light humor instead of bathroom sleazy humor to get it's point across. Julie Bowen has a small role as Spacey's unfaithful wife. The trio of Sudeikis, Day, and Bateman could have delivered a classic but it's mediocre here.",Horrible Bosses

29,DICK STEEL,A Nutshell Review: Horrible Bosses,10,5 August 2011,"I'm sure many of us have encountered bosses we'd love to hate, or worse, actually are demonstrating some of the mean traits on display in the movie as bosses ourselves. Horrible Bosses by Seth Gordon amplifies just about everything negative from people we report to, ranging from accusations, lies, and the passing the buck to right size the company, and delivered a roaring, laugh out loud comedy that employed everything from slapstick to the requisite toilet humour and though as simple and clichéd as the story might be, scored on all its attempts thanks in part to the performance of its ensemble cast.Michael Markowitz's story introduces us to the bullied protagonists of Nick Hendricks, a typical employee sucking everything his boss Dave Harken (Kevin Spacey) throws at him due to the belief that only those who suck up get to rise the corporate ladder, finding out the hard way that his boss is actually one heck of a motivator in the most negative sense. Dale Arbus (Charlie Day) on the other hand has to fend off the countless of sexual harassment moments as the dentist's assistant to his dentist employer, played by the really smoking hot Jennifer Aniston as Dr Julia Harris, with a sexual appetite that's hard to placate. And rounding off the three buddies in distress is Kurt Buckman (Jason Sudeikis), working in a family company whose boss Jack Pellit (Donald Sutherland) had passed away, leaving behind the top job for his son Bobby (Colin Farrell) to take over, where the crack head is absolutely clueless in the running of the company if not for the profits to milk from.In one drunken stupor they hatch a hypothetical plan to bump off the thorns at their sides, only for their plans to be kickstarted into actual motion when the last straw broke the camel's back. The story shifts into high gear with the trio figuring out how best to carry out their threats and plans with minimal risks, and here's where the cameos by Ioan Gruffudd and Jamie Foxx as an ex-convict turned consultant breathed some bravado into the trio's plans.If I were to compare the recent comedies involving a brethren of good friends to Horrible Bosses, I dare say Horrible Bosses had enough legs in it to best even The Hangover, even with its simpler, straightforward narrative. There are of course some similarities here such as relying on the chemistry of its protagonists to carry the film through from one set piece to the next, and the plenty of sexual innuendos thrown around, but it is exactly this camaraderie on display here by Jason Bateman, Charlie Day and Jason Sudeikis in executing their shenanigans that gives this film its one up against the competition.Interesting enough, the best roles here are those of the antagonistic Bosses even though they play caricatures. Kevin Spacey may just have recycled his role here from ones he had played in his earlier works, but I suppose watching Spacey recycle is but a guilt trip all over again. Collin Farrell almost does a Les Grossman clone here with his trash talking, hair thinning role, while Jennifer Aniston plays a very in your face femme fatale who spares no effort in pushing the boundaries of sexual harassment - though I'm pretty sure any hot blooded male would take up that challenge - and like Tom Cruise's effort in playing something totally different in Tropic Thunder, does the same here in portraying a character never seen before from her filmography, firmly smashing being typecast in this minor role. Somehow the best lines got reserved for these three characters, and they delivered them with aplomb.Like Revenge of the Nerds, Horrible Bosses celebrates the little guy, where the bullied are hoping to seek some justice in their lives when forced to a corner, fighting back even when they don't know exactly how. Enough surprises are thrown along the way, and its simplicity is its key here in setting everything up without a careless loose end. Ultimately it's still a fantasy piece that we can all have a good time at, before those who really have horrible bosses wake up to reality post screening. Horrible Bosses gets my vote as one of the best comedies this year, and those who do have one or a few in real life have my sympathies. Highly recommended!",Horrible Bosses

31,Smells_Like_Cheese,"Hmmm, this movie gave me a very bad idea",7,16 July 2011,"A few months ago I saw the trailer for Horrible Bosses, the first thing that came to mind is ""Finally, a true fantasy movie!"". Not to sound cruel, just who hasn't had a horrible boss and dreamt of the day that they were either fired from the company or even to the point of dead just because it seems like they don't deserve to be amongst human society? But after hearing some great reviews, my boyfriend and I saw this film the other day and had a great time! Even though it's a pretty average comedy, what really makes this film work so well is the great cast, they had such a great connection and you can tell. The thing that makes most comedies great is when you saw the cast have a good time, so it's like you're getting invited to the cool party and you're allowed to have fun. This is the black comedy we have been needing in a while, with it's flaws, I promise you will have more than a few good laughs with Horrible Bosses.Nick, Dale, and Kurt are friends who despise their bosses. Nick works at a financial firm for Dave, who abuses Nick constantly. Dale is a dental assistant to Dr. Julia, who wants to have sex with Dale, who is engaged. Kurt enjoys his job working at an industrial company for Pellitt, who treats Kurt like a son, but Jack dies of a heart attack one day, leaving his biological, cocaine-addicted son Bobby in charge. One night over drinks, Kurt suggests their lives would be happier if their bosses weren't alive. That night, they finally agree to help kill their bosses. They go into a bar and meet Dean ""Motherfer"" Jones, a paroled ex-con who will only agree to be a murder consultant. Jones suggests that the three stage murders that look like accidents and that they do each others' bosses so as to not be traced. They all agree and now are out to get their boses.I'd say the only story that was a bit unbelievable was Dale's, he has Jennifer Anniston for a boss and she's just going above and beyond sexually harassing him. It was just a little unbelievable how far she was taking it, not to mention that when his friend saw her through the window when he was spying on her and she's having all these ""suggestive"" foods, funny but I'm sure if I see this again I won't laugh at that part just because it is a bit predictable. But the one story I wished they carried a little more was Kurt's boss, Dale played by Collin Farrel, he was way too funny, even though cruel, it's a comedy so you're allowed to laugh. But there could have been more fun jokes played around him, but who knows; it might have been overkill. Kevin Spacey seems to have more fun playing a bad guy, you can tell he just had a ball with this movie and he was such a pleasure to watch. Our three main actors playing the friends have such a great connection and are like today's three stooges, they worked really well playing off each other. But for me it was the bosses who stole the show, especially Kevin Spacey, but he's just a great actor. His last act with the group was priceless and it's the reason why I will always put him in my top ten list of actors. I would definitely recommend Horrible Bosses, it's a great comedy that I'm sure you'll get a few laughs from.7/10",Horrible Bosses

It's the theme of having a horrible boss that I and many others can relate to! Like the characters in this film many of us would even go as far as a plan to kill our boss. It's a fact stress and problems come from work mostly from those in charge and the ones that work over us. It's typical you know the boss is arrogant a prick and cold and uncaring just wanting to work you to death. Then in this comedy we see and wish we could have fun with a plan to conspire like three workers did! Set in sunny and beautiful California it involves three single guys all friends who work for horrible bosses. Nick Hendricks(a nice big screen return from Jason Bateman)is a hard working office systems man who's always dogged and treated badly by his prick and cock arrogant boss Dave Harken(good performance from Kevin Spacey). Nick's not getting a raise or even a promotion! And Kurt Buckman(Jason Sudeikis)is stuck in a tough and dead end job for a chemical trash company with the throne now being steered by party boy, hooker chaser and coke sniffer Mr. Pellit(Colin Farrell). And most interesting is the case of Dale(the funny Charlie Day) a dental assistant who's got a hot and sexy cougar boss in the form of Dr. Julia Harris(in one of the more sexy roles that Jennifer Aniston has had in a long time!)who's always a hot distraction at the dental chair for Dale and that's even while they work on patients! Some of the foul mouth and sexual teases are just downright nasty! A plan forms for all three to get rid of their bosses only as with these crazy far out comedies nothing goes as planned. Things look bad yet in the end they twist the right way as the trio will hopefully live happily for a change. Yet this film is a wild ride very funny and unexpected moments of wild happenings the writing is very funny and far out for a comedy film, it's a chuckle! And it's very enjoyable due to the sex appeal and hot scenes that Jennifer Aniston brings(her black bra and panties scene was sugar and spice good eye candy!)

Since 2011 has not been a good year for comedy this might be the best one of this year.Foxx is part of a large mostly male cast that is pretty well known. Think this helps make the movie better too. Jennifer Aniston is one of the few women around. She does have one hilarious moment in the film but little else. While it is one of the most successful film she has been associated with, Jennifer has little to do here.I can understand some of the box office appeal, who doesn't sometimes have a horrible boss they want to eliminate?

34,lasttimeisaw,Horrible Bosses,5,17 March 2012,"Too raunchy to be applauded and appreciated, this slapstick ragbag squeezes a whiff of middling laughters while all its characters are in deficit of credibility (compared with BRIDESMAIDS 2011). The film typifies that while possessing an engrossing notion, it falls short of imagination and practical measures to present it into a gleeful feature-length work, a filmmaker's block? Surely it is. The glistening cast presents a leading-star-playing-wacky-supporting-role pattern, passably attracts their most loyal groupies and also intrigues many non-comedy cinema-goers to witness the fervently hyped overturn of these stars. Quite a cunning move and ostensibly it has functioned (a worldwide gross $209,638,559 is purely stunning). Plot-wise, Jennifer Aniston's section is too weak to be taken for granted, particularly for a hamsterishly squeaky Charlie Day (she's way out of his league, right?), nevertheless, this part is most laughable and refreshing. Kevin Spacey practically plays a main villain in it, 12 years after American BEAUTY 1999, his second spring woefully has arrived yet, a full-out one-dimensional asshole simply cannot pay his dues. As for Colin Farrell, one should chuckle that he doesn't own much screen time, his outfit is tellingly steals his thunder. The film could have been more authentic (e.g. replace Aniston with some eye-broccoli cypher, excise the unfunny gags with ass-brush or anything relates the organ, don't make Jason Sudeikis's character a moronic sex-addict etc.), but pitifully the markets crammed with run- of-the-mill pictures (check the top 10 of the northern American box office at the rotten tomatoes last week, no single film was able to procure a fresh status, an after-awards-season syndrome?), which targets different audiences, even though for people who only looks for shallow laughters in the cinema, the film faintly undercuts its audience, mercifully not much.

Yeah the characters are so goofy to the point it's not believable, but that element works in this movie. Some of the big name actors and actresses roles weren't that big but that really didn't matter, although Jennifer Aniston is still hot. Anyways the cast is what makes this movie work, because of the way they act and interact with each in a goofy and yet funny manner. It's immature and stupid and yet witty at the same time.

That's the basic premise of ""Horrible Bosses,"" in which three guys (Jason Bateman, Charlie Day and Jason Sudeikis) decide they're fed up with their bosses (Kevin Spacey, Jennifer Aniston and Colin Farrell) and decide to kill them, the only problem being that they don't have a clue how to go about doing that, so they hire a guy (Jamie Foxx, whose character's name is so crude that it probably can't even be included) to do it, except that he turns out to only want to advise them how to do it because his prison time was for illegally recording a movie in a theatre! If it sounds crazy, it is. It's a wild ride.It's an extremely crude movie. Obscenities and sexual innuendo run rampant through the whole thing (surprisingly, perhaps, since actors like Bateman and Aniston generally have a more ""wholesome"" image.) To be honest I didn't buy Aniston in the role of the nymphomaniac dentist Julia, who's out to bed her dental assistant (Day.) Of course, all three bosses were over the top caricatures of the horrible boss, so that in addition to Aniston, Farrell's Pellit is a mean pothead who inherited the company from the father he couldn't stand, and Spacey's Harken is just plain mean toward the world and everyone in it. In addition to being extremely crude, this also includes a few very funny scenes. The one that really did get me laughing was watching the scene in which Harken (Spacey) goes into anaphylactic shock and Dale (Day) saves his life by stabbing him repeatedly in the heart with his epi-pen, while his pals look on and think he's actually committing the murder. Aside from that one scene, though, I would describe this as often amusing, but not really a spectacular comedy. (6/10)",Horrible Bosses
37,Hellmant,'HORRIBLE BOSSES' isn't horrible but it isn't that good either.,5,9 July 2011,"'HORRIBLE BOSSES': Two and a Half Stars (Out of Five) Dark comedy with a plot-line almost everyone can relate to focusing on three men who plot to kill their self absorbed sadistic bosses. In today's economy the premise is almost guaranteed box-office gold but that's one of the only things the film really has going for it. It's yet another comedy that probably sounded a lot better on paper but then failed to translate (any strong humor) to the screen. One other thing the film does have going for it though is a really strong and impressive cast featuring Jason Bateman, Jason Sudeikis, Charlie Day, Kevin Spacey, Jennifer Aniston, Collin Farrell, Julie Bowen, Donald Sutherland and Jamie Foxx. It was written by Michael Markowitz, Jonathan M. Goldstein and John Francis Daley (who also plays a small part in the film) and directed by Seth Gordon (who's known for directing the popular documentary 'THE KING OF KONG: A FISTFUL OF QUARTERS' and a segment of another documentary film known as 'FREAKONOMICS').Bateman stars as Nick Hendricks, an employee of a successful financial firm who has been putting up with his abusive boss, Dave Harken (Spacey), for years in hopes of a promotion. When the time comes for Nick to receive the promotion he deserves Harken absorbs the position himself instead. Day plays a recently engaged dental assistant named Dale Arbus who constantly has to put up with his boss Julia Harris's (Aniston) inappropriate sexual advances. Things escalate to the point where Julia blackmails Dale into having sex with her. Sudeikis also co-stars as a happily employed industrial worker named Kurt Buckman who has a change of fortune when his lovable boss Jack Pellitt (Sutherland) dies and his moronic cocaine addicted son Bobby (Farrell) takes over the company. All three men reach the point where they decide to resort to murder and look into hiring a specialist to 'take out' their bosses. They turn to Dean ""Motherf---er"" Jones (Foxx) to do the job.The film works on a lot of levels: the actors are all well cast and deliver strong performances and the movie has a lot of funny ideas. The directing is a little off target though and the script probably could have used some more polishing. The cast is funny but I can think of a few better casting choices, in my opinion. I would have went with a Charlize Theron, Salma Hayek or Sigourney Weaver in Aniston's role. Jennifer does her best but she's a little too sweet and innocent to really pull off that part. I also would have went with more notorious celebrities for the Farrell and Spacey roles (although Spacey is perfect in his part, he seems like he's so full of himself that he does make the perfect ass). Someone like Charlie Sheen or Mel Gibson would have been hilarious in Farrell's role though (especially Sheen). One of the main problems with the film is you don't hate the bosses enough. In order for the film to be really relatable the bosses should have been almost pure evil. The movie is also not dark enough so it has a really uneven tone. Three likable guys resort to murder pretty quickly but of course the viewer always knows they're not going to be able to go through with it. Even with all these flaws the movie's main problem is that it's just not that funny. Parts work but not a single scene is truly laugh out loud hilarious (Foxx is completely wasted in the film).

39,thesar-2,9 2 5 2,9,2 September 2019,"Horrible First Review...HORRIBLE BOSSES (Revisited for Labor Day 2019.) I guess I wasn't high enough back on the day after release: 7/6/11. Well, technically, I'm not high now, but I thoroughly enjoyed this comedy 10x more than before.Technically? Literally.Anyways, it's probably because I now watched the uncut version or because I appreciated the humor after spending another 8 more years in an office setting. I had a freaking ball. Laughing out loud so many times, I had to keep rewinding it. Couldn't do that in theatres in 2011.Funny thing. My own boss asked me what I was planning this weekend. I told the truth: I wanted to re-watch for the 2nd time: Horrible Bosses both for Labor Day 2019 and to finally see the sequel for the first time. Then I spent the next couple of minutes explaining *I* didn't have a horrible boss to my boss. It...I...was a mess.At least I don't wanna kill her. Or have been raked over for a promotion from her, or manipulated by her skeevy son - IF she has one! or even sexually harassed by her.All the while during this revisit almost a decade later, I kept thinking: The Hangover, another one of my favorite comedies. This would be the best double-feature with that film. That is, if Horrible Bosses 2 isn't that great coming up next.*** Final thoughts: Here's my original review from 7/9/11:9 2 5 2There's a Red-Band trailer for Horrible Bosses.

41,Robert_duder,A fun dark comedy that gives you what you'd expect,7,1 January 2012,"Horrible Bosses is exactly what it looks like it would be. No more and no less and there is nothing wrong with that. Its hard to make a flat out slapstick comedy about murder but they do pull it off and while some of the laughs and gags are distinctly dark and disturbing you will laugh a lot, there is no doubt about it. Ironically it isn't the main cast which will have you in stitches but rather the bosses themselves. Jason Bateman, Charlie Day, and Jason Sudekis are all good but they don't really stand out as the ones delivering the comedy in the movie. They all have good chemistry together and deliver the story well. This movie shines when it comes to Kevin Spacey who delivers a dark, twisted, spiteful performance as Bateman's boss, and Colin Farrell as the dim witted, angry boss to Sudekis. Some of Farrell's one liners are just classic and you'll be spouting them to your friend's for weeks. Jennifer Aniston is also good as the sex crazed Dentist and boss to Day but she wasn't my favorite. I thought she was rather darkly disturbing even too much for this film and just didn't much care for her character. Jamie Foxx is sadly underused but has a great small role as the killer for hire that wants to teach them to kill their bosses. This is definitely a dark comedy but its also laugh out loud at the same time and the way the movie comes together and ends is actually very funny and outlandish at the same time. Director Seth Gordon comes from some very funny Television and that comedy carries over to Horrible Bosses which is great fun, maybe not outstanding but still all around fun to watch. 7/10",Horrible Bosses
42,bowmanblue,How would you kill yours?,8,2 January 2015,"How has this movie never been made before? With all the horrible bosses in the world and all the employees wanting to dismember them, surely someone should have committed it to film by now! Basically, the story follows three downtrodden employees working for three horrible bosses (Kevin Spacey, Colin Farrell and Jenifer Aniston - who, if you're a man, does not count as a 'horrible' boss and would relish the chance to work alongside her in her dental practice - amen to that.) One night they decide they've had enough and that the only way to go through with it is to murder their tormentors.The three bosses manage to steal every scene they're in, but the three employees do well on their own. This is a great film to unwind to. Sure, you can probably pick out a few plot holes and the humour is dependent on how bigger pinch of salt you take with this whole movie, but I loved it anyway (and that goes double for Ms Aniston) and has given me plenty of food for thought with regards to how I can work my way up the career ladder.Short and sweet - simply great fun.",Horrible Bosses

44,g-bodyl,Hilarious!,9,2 March 2013,"Horrible Bosses is one absolutely hilarious movie as it tries to push the boundaries of R-rated comedies even further as recent comedies have been doing. Some people may find this truly offensive while others such as myself, may find this to be a very funny comedy. I mean when I come to think about it, people seem to relate with the premise especially those who have nasty, horrible bosses.Seth Gordon's film is about a group of guys who are having trouble with their bosses. One expects a promotion after eight years of hard work and doesn't get it, one is constantly sexually harassed by his boss, and the other just despises his recently made boss because he wants to put other people in danger and is a cokehead. They make a pact to kill their bosses but will it work? The three main leads as a group are likable enough. Jason Bateman as always delivers a solid, funny performance. He has good chemistry with Jason Sudeikis who is also funny. I thought Charlie Day was quite annoying. However the real show goes to the bosses and Jamie Foxx. Foxx is just great in his role which I won't share. I barely even recognized Jennifer Aniston since she was so good. I also give kudos to Colin Farrell and the wonderful Kevin Spacey.Overall, this is a hilarious movie with a relatable premise. The majority of these jokes worked because they stretched the boundaries that have been previously unseen in other comedies. It would be nice to a sequel with the main cast returning but I don't think that's likely. I rate this film 9/10.",Horrible Bosses

46,lesleyharris30,"Hilarious and Original Comedy,",8,12 August 2013,"Horrible Bosses is a fantastic movie with a very well developed plot and a great comedic cast. The plot description and trailer may lead you to expect that this movie is a typical comedy affair that hits all the same beats, leaving with many laughs, but no originality. However, this movie is actually quite different as far as a Frat Pack comedy goes, the stakes are risen and throughout we are in genuine suspense for the well being of these characters as a result of the criminal situation they are in. While we will mainly be laughing at how funny it is, you will also find yourself very invested in to the story. I would like to have seen more from the bosses. Granted, Bateman, Sudekis and Day are the main characters, and we are given enough of a reason to despise the antagonists, but I would have loved so much more from them. The three bosses are very, complicated and unlikeable characters that steal every scene they are in, and I do think the film's biggest downfall was not giving them enough screen time, particularly Spacey and Farrell. The cast is all around comedic brilliance. The chemistry between Jason Bateman, Jason Sudekis and Charlie Day is without a doubt the movie's highlight, there is a great back and forth between them that is a pleasure to watch. The three antagonists are also top notch, with Kevin Spacey playing a shrewd, nasty business tycoon, Jennifer Aniston as a seductive, mischievous dentist, and Colin Farrell, in one of his most out there performances, as a spoiled, slimy rich boy, no one of them have any quirks that make them forgivable, and they are always a pleasure to watch.Funny and different. A great ride from start to finish, I would certainly recommend Horrible Bosses to anybody looking for a good comedy. Three close friends that all have a tough time with their bosses work together to murder all three of them in order to make their own lives easier.Best Performance: Jason Sudekis",Horrible Bosses

48,The-Sarkologist,Probably worth seeing for some decent laughs,6,7 October 2011,"I actually ended up quite enjoying this film, and will say that there are a few twists in it, and it is quite humorous at times, however in the end it still, in many ways, is typical of the Hollywood movie making machine. I am not going to say that this is a bad movie, but it is nowhere near what I would consider hugely original, nor is it something that I would consider outrageously funny, however it is something that I did enjoy watching.The movie is about three guys who have horrible bosses. One of them is forced to work ridiculous hours for a paranoid tyrant who always dangles the promotion in front of him only to take it away at the last moment. The second is a convicted sex offender who was simply at the wrong place at the wrong time, and has landed up as a dental assistant for a nymphomaniac while his dream in life is to become a husband. The third seems to have it all right until his boss dies and the bosses son, a coke head, takes over the business and decides to milk it for all its worth so that he may live the high life.So, these guys (who are idiots by the way) decide that the only way to deal with their problem is to kill their bosses. They did flirt with leaving, but when they met one of their college friends, who used to work at Lehman Brothers before it closed down and is now wondering the streets begging, decide that this is the only way to solve their problems. As is expected, everything turns out okay, and Hollywood doesn't have to condone murder to get there (but I won't tell you otherwise it will spoil the movie).I guess this film relates to all of us who work. We have to all deal with bosses, some of them are good, some of them are bad. Those of us who are lucky to have good bosses should remember that, but the workplace will always be the workplace. It is the nature of work. When God created the world he created us to work, and work was to be enjoyable. In fact, many of us desire to work. I know that I really don't like sitting on my hands doing nothing (and earning nothing to boot) While we may not be satisfied with things like our pay, or our bosses, we must remember that this is a fallen world, and work as been frustrated. While in one sense it is enjoyable, it has been frustrated, and thus comes with a very nasty sting in its tail. While things can be done to make things better, we still will have to plod through work until the restoration of all things.However, killing your boss is unlikely to solve anything.",Horrible Bosses

The film requires some suspension of disbelief as well as few convenient coincidences to click, however, it is an enjoyable enough romp since all concerned are clearly having a lot of fun playing their parts. In fact, if anything, the film is funnier the second time round knowing some of the hilarious set-ups to come. Kevin Spacey sizzles as a condescending boss, Jamie Foxx is great as their 'coach', and Colin Farrell has some truly wacky scenes as the slackest boss in the film - though his best moments come in the blooper reel played during the end credits. Donald Sutherland on the other hand is sadly under-used and Jennifer Aniston is never credible, but most of the performances work. The chemistry between the friends feels real too, and the script smartly gives the trio all of the funniest scenes rather than letting the bigger name boss actors steal the best parts. It also wonderful to see the film so happy to acknowledge its influences and origins with not only 'Strangers on a Train', but 'Throw Momma from a Train' also mentioned. If slow to warm up, this is possibly the funniest treatment that a swapping murders story has ever gotten, though one wonders what Hitchcock would make of it if he knew that his legacy had borne comedies full of crude jokes like this like this.",Horrible Bosses

53,Floated2,Over the top and Forced Comedy,5,3 January 2014,"Horrible Bosses has been praised by many of one of the funniest, if not the funniest movie of 2011. Having passed upon it many times having little interest in it, I decided to watch it. As a comedy I expected more laughs but most of the jokes fall flat to me. The humor is either crude without meaning (many of the constant insults) and not witty or clever enough, and predictable. It is a film where I understand what the jokes are and I can imagine people laughing at them but I didn't find them funny.What does work is the story is interesting, I was interested in if they were actually to go ahead and get revenge on their bosses and see how it unfolded. The chemistry from Jason Bateman, Jason Sudeikis and Charlie Day was present as they carried the film. I didn't care too much for the bosses. Kevin Spacey's character came off bad, had no interest in Collin Farrell's, and was in between Jennifer Aniston (many other actresses could have sold the role better).Maybe laughed about twice throughout the entire film, one involving the introduction scene of Jamie Foxx and another to due with the back and forth conversation of Bateman and Day (when they sneak into Space's house). I did not find the gag with the voice detector in the car to be funny. It was almost too forced.Horrible Bosses being R rated was suited, as had it been PG-13 the appeal wouldn't be there. Only had they included more clever jokes and gags. Many of it was over the top, and the death to Farell's character was too soon (he was possibly underutilized). I think had it ended better, maybe adding a few extra scenes, this would have faired better. I am somewhat wondering how the sequel will be, as seeing many sequels to comedy hits haven't been as great as the original.
As a rewatch 04/19/19' Horrible Bosses does certain things right but is also quite over the top. The lead characters are likable but as a comedy, nothing was too funny. More so predictable humor.",Horrible Bosses

From my side, I also laughed and I was the first surprised because I never imagined that I would ever watch a movie starring Farrell + Spacey + Foxx. Fortunately, they don't have much screen time and it's really about the crazy plans of those three buddies. For one time, the ideas are here and that's a labeled comedy that is indeed funny. The power of the movie is that we can all relate to odious bosses as well in our life and thus the movie acts like a catharsis. Jennifer was cute in this movie with her black hair and the three buddies, albeit unknown to me were excellent in their goofiness. The funnier for me was that Bateman looks really like another old colleague who like him was very decent with our old octopus boss. I have even nicknamed him ""Kai-Kai"" for all the punches she slapped on his nose thus this movie was a great mirror and I dedicate this review to him!",Horrible Bosses
55,TheMovieDiorama,Horrible Bosses showcases three self-obsessed individuals to create a humorous comedy.,6,30 July 2018,"Bosses, who would have them? No one likes being told what to do. It's human nature to not want to be bossed around like a minion whilst the head honcho is making mountains of dollar. So when this comedy presents three different yet similar bosses, you may find one of them to be relatable (or you're lucky enough to have Sutherland's character). Three friends plot the murders of their overbearing bosses. We have a psychopathic master manipulator (Spacey), a sexually aggressive maneater (Aniston) and a moronic cocaine-addict (Farrell). This is a rather dark comedy from director Gordon, tackling the theoretical possibility of murder from three seemingly innocent hard workers. Bateman plays himself in everything. Sudeikis charismatically plays his part and possibly becomes the funniest. Day...well, he just grates on me. The constant high-pitched shouting does become tiresome. However, it's the three employers that really shine, clearly imitating enjoyment and hilarity within their performances. The screenplay, again, reaches for the depths of darkness. There are a few unnecessary misogynistic and racist jokes, but the vast majority of scenes and gags bring plenty of laughs. Including, but not limited to, manipulating an employee to drink scotch at 8:15am or searching for a hitman who turns out to be their ""murder consultant"". It's all fun and games for this American comedy, which is definitely one of the stronger modern films of its genre. Upholding a clean narrative structure that somewhat dissipates towards its conclusion. The first act impressively sets up each character and their motives, the second act slightly dips into the unimaginative territory and then the final act crumbles completely with plot conveniences and a rushed ending. As if Markowitz could not think of a suitable resolution, so settles with the most uninspiring forgettable conclusion possible. Horrible Bosses may not be as horrible as its title suggests, boasting decent performances and laughs. But loses it entirely in its final act.",Horrible Bosses
56,Movie_Muse_Reviews,"Killer concept and comic chemistry make for far from ""Horrible""",7,2 August 2011,"A story of average guys who become small-time crooks always has comedic value; add to that the blue-collar motivation of wanting to kill your boss because he/she makes your life miserable? Golden. Documentary director Seth Gordon (""The King of Kong"") ropes up an impressive ensemble to make ""Horrible Bosses,"" a vaguely dark comedy with a concept that does half the work. Despite a slightly addled plot, the film offers a variety of laughs from the R-rated sex humor of many of today's comedies to more standard slapstick.Jason Bateman, Charlie Day and Jason Sudeikis star as a trio of friends who despise their bosses for one reason or another. Bateman's the first to arrive and last to leave work every day to get a promotion after eight years, but his asshole boss (Spacey) plays him like a puppet; Day's a dental assistant with plans to be married, but his nymphomaniac boss (Jennifer Aniston) plans to blackmail him into sleeping with her; Sudeikis, on the other hand, loves his job, but when his great boss dies, his soulless coke-head son (Colin Farrell) takes over and looks to ruin everything out of spite. After first joking about taking them out, the three realize they'll be eternally miserable if they don't do something drastic.The three amigos have a classic comic chemistry; they're all idiots in their own respects, namely Day and Sudeikis, which is weird because Bateman — a terrific character actor — has suddenly become the face of the straight-laced everyman. Although we sympathize with Bateman the most, he offers the least amount of entertainment. Sudeikis and Day on the other hand offer dynamic humor. Day's the most lovable as he exercises that doe-eyed stupidity and cluelessness whereas Sudeikis gets to be the jerk who puts sex ahead of everything and thinks he has tact when in fact he's incredibly ignorant. The Stooge-like function of their friendship provides most of the humor, though sometimes the slapstick diverges a bit from the tone of the story.As far as the bosses, all three come off as horrible as they need to for the story to work. Spacey earns points for being particularly despicable and as such gets most of the boss spotlight whereas Aniston earns the most laughs for playing against type. Farrell is practically unrecognizable, which delivers in a couple places, but mostly the script takes the character way over the top.I would've loved to have seen the Coen brothers script this comedy as not only does it perfectly suit their proclivities, but it also would've found some true wit and poignancy amidst the murder-plotting chaos. ""Horrible Bosses"" does well enough for the sake of humor and shows flashes of cleverness throughout such as the way Jamie Foxx's ""Mother****er"" Jones"" gets involved as a ""murder consultant,"" but the plot has a hard time wrapping up in a satisfying way. Toward the end, the film struggles in determining whether to head down the darker path or take the lighter more farcical one. Instead of choosing, however, the story never fully commits to either.In general, the schizophrenic tone and tendency to pin turning points on the stupidity of the characters doesn't outweigh the comic performances. Although we never get deeper than the characters' personality traits and a motivation to kill their bosses, it's enough of a portrait to take away some hardy laughs as well as interest in what will happen to them. Lastly, the killer (no pun intended) premise provides enough reason to take a vested interest in the final outcome.~Steven CVisit my site at http://moviemusereviews.com",Horrible Bosses

I love the cast, the characters, the entire plot, basically everything from this movie that you're meant to enjoy, I do. I love how the bad, or horrible, bosses, get it, get what they deserve. In this movie, Dale, Kurt and Nick are three average, hard working, nice guys. But they don't get treated that way. One has a boss who wants to sleep with him, and won't take no for an answer. One does a lot of hard work but never gets recognized for it. And one was meant to get a promotion, until his really nice boss died, and his cocaine addicted son became his boss. They are fed up, and I'm not surprised. So they decide to kill their bosses. Each of them will kill another boss, so there is no link between them.

Sudeikis boss is played by Collin Farrell, who is a crazy drug addled fool, and likes to fire people because of certain things about them, Days boss is played by Jennifer Aniston, a sexy temptress, who sexually harasses him, a good part of the day, and Batemans boss is played by Kevin Spacey, is a guy you don't even love to hate, you just hate period. All three come up with a plan kill each others bosses, they get advise from a former Criminal played by Jamie Fox, but the question is will they go through with it? Horrible Bosses I think is the funniest movie of 2011, Bateman, Day, and Sudeikis are all very funny, they play off each other perfectly, and there funny reactions during all the hilarity. The bosses are pretty funny, and unlikable in there own way. And Aniston is good too, a little departure from what she usually plays. Like I said it puts The Hangover to shame.",Horrible Bosses
59,Polaris_DiB,Funnier than expected,8,14 August 2011,"The first question going in the theatre is how these guys are going to justify killing their bosses to themselves and us in a way that doesn't feel like too much of a device. Just as how in Office Space their revenge has to be turned on them to prevent any viewers from getting the wrong idea, this movie had to really win us over on their intentions while also holding back from leading people to the wrong moral conclusions. So it did so by making the bosses incredibly sadistic.Which is great! The three main characters as television-trained comedy leads works for a sort of small-screen charm and episodic shortsightedness while the three bigger star actors as the bosses get to be Big Personalities. It's surprising how little of the gags in the movie end up being too gimmicky--even the ""wet worker"" scene, the most disposable in the movie, ends up showcasing just how inept these guys are and justifies their decision that leads them to the character named Mother****er Jones (mrp mrp IMDb guidelines). Even that groan-worthy joke works, partly because of a buildup behind M. Jones' explanation if his name but also because this is just how out-of-their-league the leads are. Also, Jamie Foxx embraces that character and makes it shine. Everyone seemed to relish their roles. No one the less than Jennifer Aniston, who seems transformed here....but nowhere near as much as Colin Ferrell, which if the credits hadn't told me, I would have never noticed it was him.So anyway, the basic plot is this: three guys got three bosses that they decide to kill off. One boss is an unabashed egomaniac willing to tell you to your face that he'll eat you alive (Kevin Spacey, deliciously evil); another is a nymphomaniacal dentist (Jennifer Aniston) who sexually molests her assistant (Charlie Day) by blackmailing him against his fiancée; and the third is a raging coke addict (Colin Ferrell). From here, however, the movie plays it smart and focuses more on the leads (Day, Jason Bateman, and Jason Sudeikis) as they figure out how to pull off their intent. The smart move the movie takes is to show they can't even figure out how to figure out their intent. Things spiral out of control and it becomes a race for the characters just to catch up with themselves. These guys are so effectively clueless that it takes a deft series of mistakes and misunderstandings just to get them to the point where they can even ask themselves if they are capable of taking a human life. And of course by then things have happened beyond their ability to go back, really justifying the movie's brisk playlength. You'll be amazed how quickly time flies while watching this movie.There certainly is a bit of a disappointment that the movie did not really go into questioning and reminiscing on its concept a little more. This movie under the hands of someone like the Coen brothers would have made an amazingly dry classic. However, it is under the capable hands of Seth Gordon, whose King of Kong: a Fistful of Quarters shows an almost equally sadistic ego/underdog id relationship. Perhaps in a sense the characters ARE too big to be fully believable and there's something more serious to go with here, but what this movie does have works well for it, and its closing sequence is a perfect closing note to the rest of the movie.Now my qualms. Of all the boss/employee relationships shown here, the one between Jennifer Aniston and Charlie Day has a lot of room for criticism. This is a situation where if the genders were reversed, people would NOT find this movie funny... and my feelings about that are a little mixed. Is it wrong that we find this funny, or is it wrong that we wouldn't if the genders were reversed? However, there are two other reasons to criticize its inclusion. One is that whereas all the story elements ultimately work themselves out satisfactorily, nevertheless nympho-chick sort of gets forgotten as the two other bosses take over the movie for a bit. The unbalanced structure works because the movie ties up all its loose ends, but there is the fact that this part of the story is predicated on Day not wanting to lose his girlfriend. So, riddle me this, why couldn't he have said to his fiancée before psycho-lady drops the payload that she was trying to blackmail him? The question is tossed off with, ""Oh well nobody will believe you because you're a sex criminal"", but if we're to believe that this marriage he hopes so much for is supposed to have any basis for survival, we have to also believe duder has a spine and the trust of his lady. The spine is character development--the trust... absent. Nothing can convince me that Day's character could not have found at least some way of telling his fiancée what he told his friends, how he told them, and earn her trust--especially since he is clear whenever he tells everyone else about it that this is real victimhood.So in that storyline is a wide variety of issues that may end up pulling this movie down from a deserved cult status. To be fair, it does point out things that need to be acknowledged, like the dismissiveness of most people towards the concept of female-to-male molestation and our tendency to automatically villify sex criminals without ensuring we know the actual crime. It's a storyline that I feel only falls apart because there's not enough of the relationship shown to believe in it, but it's open to being torn down depending on the reception of the audience. Nevertheless I found the movie hilarious and witty, well written despite three writers and with surprising and welcome twists, with a satisfying payoff.--PolarisDiB",Horrible Bosses
60,dfranzen70,A hot Jennifer Aniston with a potty mouth? Sign me up,7,30 March 2012,"We've all had them, although not quite the way these guys do. Mean boss- bullies. What looked at first to be another dopey Office Space wannabe turned out to be pretty hysterical in places. Part of it's the script, but a lot of it is in the casting. Think of it as more than Office Space - it's Office Space with the piquant aftertaste of The Hangover.Nick (Jason Bateman) has one of those tyrannical hate-everyone bosses (Kevin Spacey). Kurt's (Jason Sudeikis) boss is a coked-up freak (Colin Farrell). Dale (Charlie Day) has an oversexed maneater (Jennifer Aniston, playing way against type). Each for his own reason has issues. And, for reasons not necessary to reveal here, they conclude that each supervisor must be killed off.I liked this movie. For one thing, I could - as I'm sure many people can - identify easily with each of the main characters to some extent. They were relatable, not caricatures. I mean, sure, they sort of leap to the conclusion rather quickly that murder should be committed, but that's just nitpicking. You buy into the premise, you take what you get.It's a well-cast film. Bateman surprised me a great deal. When I heard he was to be in this movie, I assumed he'd be one of the bosses, because he's lately played so many smarmy jerks. But not here - here, he's the sensible one, and he gets some of the best lines in the movie. Delivery is flawless. Sudeikis I could do without, but he does add some smarm of his own, thus offsetting Nick's niceness rather neatly. But for me the best was Charlie Day, who's best known for his role on It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia. He's a manic panic and a true comic find. I hope this turns out to be a bit of a breakout role for him.The bosses are also interestingly cast. I mean, I always pictured Aniston as a goody two-shoes. That's the image, right? The good girl who meets cute with someone? Oh, not here. So not here. Here she's about as X rated as you can get. And she's stunningly good at it, too. Doesn't even feel like she's playing a role. Spacey is essentially playing the same role he had in Swimming with Sharks, only even nastier, and of course he's up to the task. Farrell gets the short end of the stick; he gets limited screen time, but that's okay.Horrible Bosses offers plenty of madcap fun at an R-rated level without stooping to poop jokes. A nice switch, wouldn't you say? I mean, it's not Henry V, but at least it's not Freddy Got Fingered. It's at the right intelligence level - you can veg out and enjoy it without feeling the least bit ashamed.",Horrible Bosses
61,PWNYCNY,A laugh-producing machine.,9,13 July 2011,"This movie is hilarious. Every scene is funny. Jennifer Aniston has never been better. She is not only a great actress, she is a great comedienne too. Charlie Day gives one of the funniest performances in a Hollywood movie in years. His phone scene with Ms. Aniston is hilarious, a take off on the Doris Day - Rock Hudson romantic comedies from the 1960s. Colin Farrell and Kevin Spacey give wonderful, strong performances. They are great actors and prove it in this movie. Playing heavies, they are perfect foils for the comics in this movie. The trio of Bateman, Sudeikis and Day is the best comedy combo since Chevy Chase, Steve Martin and Martin Short in Three Amigos. If this movie doesn't make you laugh, and laugh often, then either you're sleeping or you just don't like comedies. This movie is proof that when it wants to, Hollywood can make a comedy that actually produces laughs. The story is zany, goofy and upbeat. It's a farce, a romp, and a laugh-producing machine.",Horrible Bosses
62,meeza,"You be the boss, but I thought it was pretty good, though not great.",8,9 July 2011,"The supervisor revenge comedy ""Horrible Bosses"" is not horrible, not terrible, definitely tolerable, but not incredible. Jason Bateman, Charlie Day, and Jason Sudeikis star as employee slaves to controlling bosses who decide to take the ""last resort"" highway in seeking vengeance to their higher ups by scheming to murder them. Bateman plays Dale Arbus, an overworked office employee who is constantly scrutinized by his hardball boss Dave Harken. Sudeikis portrays Kurt Buckman, a man who works for the bucks in a family owned chemical company who's controlled by the egocentric cokehead Bobby Pellitt after Pellitt's admirable father passes away from a heart attack, and therefore making Buckman's worklife a living nightmare. And the day has come (or at least the time) to tell you that Day spent his days on ""Horrible Bosses"" playing dental assistant Dale Arbus, he who is sexually harassed by a voluptuous female dentist boss Dr. Julia Harris; who is portrayed by a very sexy Jennifer Aniston. I think the last one is not so horrible and that is no muela, but it is for Dale since he is recently engaged and had always wanted to be a ""husband"" when he grew up. The Three Amigos put their liquid assets together so they can liquidate their Three Jefes. However, they are not exactly The Big Three Killing Machine, more like The Three Stooges. So therefore, they try to contract a hit-man to do the dirty deed. Things do not go exactly according to plan on that, so they end up contracting ""murder consultant"" Dean ""MF"" Jones. Director Seth Gordon commands ""Horrible Bosses"" with lots of slapstick comedy which at times raises the comedy of the film, but at others it downsizes its narrative. I prefer the subtle comedy Gordon inserts in the film and I rather promote that aspect of the movie. Screenwriters Michael Markowitz and John Francis Daley should have been more closely supervised by their boss Gordon, because their screenplay needed some polish even though it did have enough comedic turns to be it classified as a moderate success, so good (not great) job goes out to Michael and John. Our three leading actors Bateman, Day, and Sudeikis were solid with their performances but not ready to promote them as the exemplary comedic performances of 2011. However, their evil thespian counterparts were bad to the bone! Kevin Spacey was vintage villainous Kevin Spacey as the profoundly horrible Harken. Colin Farrell was the scene-stealer of all the thespian employees of ""Horrible Bosses"" with his spectacular work as the despicable Pellitt; I am just Pellitting as it is. And my friends, I guarantee you have never seen this side of Jennifer Aniston with her hands-on deadpan performance as the Sexual Dentist the Menace Dr. Harris. Jamie Foxx was also a bad M.F. and a sure hit with his work as Dean ""M.F"" Jones; just wanted to see more of it. Overall, this movie is not in the company of superb workplace comedies as ""Office Space"", but then again you will not spend horrible losses of time by clocking in to ""Horrible Bosses"". **** Good",Horrible Bosses

Jason Bateman, Charlie Day and Jason Sudeikis may enjoy top billing as the straight men with devious motives, but the true heart and soul of this flick is in the hilariously exaggerated supporting roles of Kevin Spacey, Jennifer Anniston and Colin Farrell as the trio's vile, larger-than-life caricature bosses. Spacey is brilliant as the venomous, capitalistic middle manager, a role he's had decades to perfect. Anniston's sex-crazed, blackmailing dentist is equally tremendous, while Farrell is barely recognizable as the selfish, partied out, comb over-laden incompetent.

64,st-shot,Horrible leads can's Bosses.,4,29 July 2011,"The bosses are excellent but the trio of leads dreadful in this pedal to the metal comedy that floors it from the start but doesn't get far with these three flat tires. Lotsa screeching but little traction.Nick, Dale and Kurt bemoan the fact that they love their jobs but hate their bosses. Unable to quit and move on they decide to hire a hit man to off them but that goes un hysterically wrong and they are left to do the dirty work by themselves. They then spend the remaining hour plus trying to whack them in a series of poorly timed dark humored bits that fall for the most part flat on their face under the slipshod direction of Seth Gordon.As the villains of the piece Kevin Spacey, Jenniffer Aniston and especially Colin Farrell as a coke head CEO with a green belt fulfill their part of the bargain with flying colors. Jamie Farr faux hit-man also registers but Jason Bateman's Nick is without spark, Jason Sudeikis' Kurt's smarmy confidence off putting and Charlie Day's Dale aggressively abrasive Bobcat Goldwaithe resurrection one annoying harangue from start to finish. There is no chemistry at all between these three stooges and the adolescent logic they employ as each clearly ignore what the other one says. I realize fifty five is the new forty but these guys act like thirty five is the new fifteen.The extent of Gordon's erratic and anally fixated direction looks like he outlined a scene turned his camera on and let the three say whatever came into their droll minds; the result being blank stares, unctuous cool and whiny hissy fits. In the credits Gordon parades his ineptitude even further by showing outtakes, one of which features the zany Farrell in a drug store dealing with a pharmacist.

66,estebangonzalez10,One of the best comedies of the year!,8,28 September 2011,"¨You can't win a marathon without putting some band aids on your nipples! ¨I've been on a hot streak recently with comedies; this is the third one in a row that I've found really funny. The laughs began with Bridesmaids, then came Cedar Rapids, and now Horrible Bosses; another hilarious comedy that perhaps is a little more mainstream than the others and has more stereotypical characters, but it is saved by the wonderful cast who really got a lot of laughs off me. Sometimes it can be hilarious to make fun of some of these stereotypes, especially when we are dealing with bosses. The characters aren't deep or anything, they are more of caricatures than normal people, but that is OK because when a comedy is done right it totally works. The plot of the story isn't new either; we've seen it before in other movies and the film even mentions them. So why did I have such a fun time with this film? The cast was brilliant! We got to see Jennifer Aniston in a role that I never thought she would do; she says things you'd never think would come out of her mouth. Then you have the rest of the cast all delivering several laughs. Sometimes the actors have such a great chemistry together that the movie just clicks and you find all the situations funny. It's like when you hear a joke that isn't that funny, but the person who tells it does it in such a great way that you just can't stop laughing. The cast makes this R-rated comedy worth it and I had a great time with Horrible Bosses. The premise of the story is pretty simple: it's about three friends who hate their bosses (extremely horrible ones) and begin talking about how they wish they would die. They can't just quit their jobs because they run into an old schoolmate of theirs who shows them how difficult it is to get a job during the recession. Their only option seems to be to kill their bosses. Nick Hendricks (Jason Bateman) works for Dave Harken (Kevin Spacey) at an important business company. Nick has worked really hard the last few months in order to get the promotion he has been expecting for a long time. Dave however gets upset because Nick happened to show up two minutes late one day to work and doesn't give him the promotion he rightfully deserves, and goes as far as blackmailing him so he won't quit either. Dale (Charlie Day) works as a dental assistant for Dr. Julia Harris (Jennifer Aniston) who sexually harasses him and claims she will tell Dale's fiancé that they've had sex if he doesn't sleep with her. Dale can't get a job anywhere else because he's been mistakenly charged with a child sex offence for peeing in a park near to a school. Kurt Buckman (Jason Sudeikis) on the other hand loves his job and his boss Jack Pellit (Donald Sutherland), but unfortunately he suffers a heart attack and passes away, leaving the company in his coke addict son's hands: Bobby (Colin Farrell). He wants to cuts expenses and tells Kurt that he must fire all the obese and disabled employers. Kurt, Dale, and Nick get together and decide the only solution to their problems is murdering each other's boss. Horrible Bosses is extremely funny, despite the strong language. It has memorable performances from Jennifer Aniston, Kevin Spacey, and Colin Farrell in roles we are not used to seeing them in. Jason Sudeikis, Charlie Day, and Jason Bateman are extremely funny in every scene they are together in; their chemistry was just great. The situations these guys got themselves into was hilarious; beginning from trying to hire a hit-man online (with a really funny cameo from Ioan Gruffudd), to getting criminal advice from an ex-con named Dean MF Jones (played by Jamie Foxx), ending up breaking into Bobby's house and accidentally sniffing some of his cocaine. Charlie Day also gets some laughs while lip singing to The Ting Tings ¨That's Not My Name¨ while staking Dave's house. I had a really great time during the entire movie, and there are just too many memorable scenes to point them all out. All I can say is that you should go check out this movie if you ever felt like you had it bad with your boss. I guarantee you won't complain anymore after seeing what these guys had to put up with. Seth Gordon did a great job with the direction of this film and I highly recommend it if you're in the mood for laughing. http://estebueno10.blogspot.com/",Horrible Bosses

How many people have found themselves in the situation that our 3 employees are in? How many times have you thought about getting 'one over on your boss'? How many times have you received a horrible e-mail from your boss or been told that you haven't done enough when you've clearly tried your best? How angry does that make you feel? Nick Hendricks (Bateman), Dale Arbus (Day) and Kurt Buckman (Sudeikis) are 3 friends who all have one thing in common; they all have bosses that are a nightmare to work for; Hendricks boss is Dave Harken (Spacey), an arrogant Vice President of a sales company who cares for no-one but himself who manipulates Hendricks into working longer hours on the basis that he will offer him a promotion. Arbus boss is Julia Harris (Aniston), a crazed nymphomaniac dentist who treats Arbus as his play thing whilst at work and continually makes sexual advances towards him even though he has a fiancé. Finally, we come to Buckman's boss Bobby Pellitt (Farrell), a coke head who assumes control of the chemical company Buckman works for when his father (Sutherland) suddenly dies from a heart attack.The 3 men decide that they cannot cope working for their current employers and feel that the only way they will be happy is by killing their employers. They decide that they require some professional help in order to carry out the killings in the most 'professional' manner. Following advice from their Sat Nav (yes you read that correct) they are directed to an area full of low lives as they hope they will be able to find someone who can give them advice on executing the killings. This is when they stumble upon Dean 'MF' Jones (Foxx) - it should be fairly obvious to most what MF is short for, but it's not a word I will write in full for obvious reasons. Jones acts as a murder consultant who charges the men a substantial amount of money in return for advice on how to carry out the perfect crimes.A lot of the laughs come from the incompetence of the 3 characters when trying to execute their crimes. I also felt that the chemistry between the 3 leads was pretty good. The acting was also great (particularly from Spacey, Farrell and Day) and I thought I'd never say this, but I actually thought that Jennifer Aniston put in a fairly decent performance. For once she didn't seem to be 'Rachel' from friends so much.Whilst Horrible Bosses is a decent watch, I personally felt that the first half was much better than the second half and I felt that it started to lose steam towards the end.

I will say though that the performances by all the bosses, including Jennifer Aniston, Kevin Spacey, and Colin Farrel were very well played. I really did enjoy Jennifer Aniston's performance in particular, she really nailed her performance as Julia, she was viscous, über sexual, and very raunchy, which was exactly what her character called for. Kevin Spacey was very good as Jason Bateman's jackass of a boss, I mean this guy was just blatantly evil, and Spacey pulled it off wonderfully. So yes, the performances were pretty good all around, although I was not that impressed at all by the lack luster dialogue and the sorta weak execution of the plot.

So one day, they decide to just go ahead and kill them. And from that premise, the black comedy arises. To cut the long story short, the three guys undergo several adventures and misadventures in order to exact their revenge on these bosses. The script is downright mean, nasty and raunchy.I did not really know the three actors who played the down-and-out guys, except Jason Bateman (vaguely). But the bosses are all-star: a pompous Kevin Spacey, a balding mousy Colin Farrell and a very sexually aggressive Jennifer Aniston. The scenarios with Spacey and Farrell are sort of familiar already and not really too funny. The most hilarious parts for me however are those that involve the lady dentist Dr. Julia Harris (Aniston) and her sexually-harassed assistant Dale (Charlie Day). her performance here is so unlike anything I have seen Jennifer in and she nails this character cold.So if you are not yet tired with this raunchy comedy trend, you can still try to catch ""Horrible Bosses.""

The film is led surprisingly well by its 3 leads, with all truly putting their A-games into their own comedic performances. The supporting actors are also quite good as well, and in total the cast proves to be quite impressive for a comedy flick. Kevin Spacey, Colin Farrell, and Jennifer Aniston all give fantastic performances as the 3 leads bosses, and the film has you rooting against them every step of the way. The film is very cleverly paced, and massively entertaining. I was never bored during the film, nor did I ever feel like it was dull in any moment. It's very tightly bound script and good performances make for quite an enjoyable experience. The film does seem to go a little overboard by pulling jokes out a little too long, and feeding material a little too heavily at times, or perhaps too predictably. However, if you go into the film with an open mind and laugh at the jokes along the way, the film can be quite a fun ride. It's humor isn't perfect, but at times the film can be very funny. It starts to grow funnier as the film goes on, and so does your interest in the film and its characters by the closing credits. In the end, Horrible Bosses is by no means a horrible comedy, and is in fact a very impressive comedic effort. It's unique concept, script, and well acted performances- not to mention it's very entertaining nature- make for one hell of a good time. It's jokes may not always land perfectly, but the film does earn a giggle or too, especially by the end.

75,dierregi,Best comedy of the year,8,21 August 2011,"What a pleasant surprise! I went to see this movie mostly because I had my share of horrible bosses in the past and I was intrigues by the trailer. It must be noted that the three male leads are basically unknown in Europe, so it was not their star power to attract me. Neither was the presence of Spacey, Aniston or Farrell, since I am not a fan of any of them.Since it was purely the topic that drew me in, I was very pleased by the plot. It was obviously demented and over the top, but still with a hint of realism. It is easy to argue that when you hate your boss you should find another job. Unfortunately, in times as ours, chances to find a better job are slim, while horrible bosses seem to proliferate. Therefore, it is easy to sympathize with the crazy murder attempts perpetrated by the trio of friends, with the help of their ""murder consultant"" (glorious idea, character brilliantly played by Jamie Foxx). In any case, it is clear that these three guys are unable to murder anybody, so I did not see any dark undertone in the comedy. It was a long time since I laughed so much at the cinema and I appreciated almost every joke (from the build-up about Jamie Foxx character's name, to the ""Gregory"" development). The only part less funny, was the sex harassment plot, which Aniston played well, and very much against type. Unfortunately, playing women with a sex angle is by far the easiest choice. Choosing a different evil for the female boss, might have been a bolder challenge.",Horrible Bosses
76,AudioFileZ,"Full of Memorable Quotes: ""That Isn't From A Movie...It is now!""",8,11 September 2011,"Horrible Bosses first and foremost is funny. There certainly is a low- key comedic brilliance in the script, a solid premise creatively at the core from which to hang black humor. Simply put, a shared emotion almost anyone can relate to is an irritating boss wielding an inordinate amount of power seemingly for no other reason other than to be a jerk. The commonality makes it easy to get on board with such a story if done well. Horrible Bosses is done so well that it sells itself in spite of the liberal use of very low-brow humor. When there are copious amounts of foul language and sophomoric humor there simply has to be an element of brilliance to keep things from being weighted down by these elements, thankfully innumerable excellent nuances abound.The performances of the three principle actors and their related bosses mesh perfectly with the script and the result is a movie that is very entertaining in spite of the ridiculous situations depicted. Jason Bateman as Nick Hendricks plays the role he naturally inhabits which is the young exasperated professional who in his deadpan comments and frustrated expressions speaks to everyone. Topping that is the part of his friend played by Jason Sudeikis. Sudeikis gets his Saturday Night Live breakout role here with his depiction of the character Kurt Buckman. Sudeikis is the glue holding the three central characters, as well as the movie, together. His character, Kurt Buckman, is a simple hedonist quite detached from reality, he is wickedly funny delivering his constant smirks and golden nugget comments. And by-the-way, those comments become instant quotes which cult fans will be repeating ad infinitum. Finally, the over-the-top performance given by Charlie Day is so outrageously spot-on hilarious he almost steals the movie. Day's character, Dale Arbus, is the most unlikely of the three to be harassed by a boss and the fact that his harassment is of the sexual variety ,which his other two friends would welcome, is a large part of what makes this story gel. Day uses such an acute and hyper expressive delivery; Horrible Bosses is worth watching twice for his performance alone. Just listening to Charlie Day deliver his lines with his high register high ""rpm"" screech slays this viewer. These three actors have a synergy when coupled with this script hit it out of the park for a grand slam homer.There is an excellent supporting cast which in order of magnitude includes Jennifer Aniston, Kevin Spacey, Colin Ferrell, and Donald Sutherland. The surprise here is the perfect performance, against type no less, by Jennifer Aniston. She truly shines and raises the performance of Charlie Day as they play off one another. Kevin Spacey plays a role he's done before except with a cold-hearted hilarious twist making his screen time irreplaceable. Colin Ferrell steps totally outside of his norm once more to create a creature like character that will double the viewer over before he spits out the few corrosive lines he delivers. Donald Sutherland is pretty much an icon who just adds a nice counterpoint to his evil son played by Farrell. Sutherland's role is small, but it is an absolute stroke of genius! And finally, speaking of utterly amazing small rolesBob Newhardt's cameo at the end is the pièce de résistance for a perfect ending! This movie is a slice of comedic gold which in spite of the ample use of low humor rises to a greater sum total effectA perfect comedy which speaks to both the mainstream and cult markets. Don't miss it.OH, THIS IS IMPORTANT...I'D SAY JENNIFER ANNISTON AND CHARLIE DAY STEAL THE SHOW...BIG-TIME.",Horrible Bosses
77,pachara87,Horrible Bosses is very funny.,9,22 January 2019,It's refreshing to see that some writers still like to turn an intriguing situation into one where laughs can flow naturally as opposed to attempting to force them out with extremely bad jokes.,Horrible Bosses
78,SnakesOnAnAfricanPlain,Horrible Bosses (2011),8,12 December 2011,"Horrible Bosses takes a trio of idiots and has them trying to kill their bosses. Sometimes stupid characters can be ever so annoying, but here the slapstick and one-liners are bountiful enough to make them likable. It is also clear that these guys are certainly no killers, making it fun to see them fail considerably. Bateman is tortured by his boss Spacey, Sudeikis has to deal with Farrell's paranoid coke head, and Day is sexually assaulted by Aniston. Each of the people playing the bosses really hits the nail on the head, though Farrell just isn't in it enough. The film never took itself as dark as I wanted, but this comes from a guy that loves Very Bad Things. I was also unsure if Aniston's role was really necessary. Not that she was bad, but the writers seemed to have a hard time including her, and even her conclusion seemed tacked on as an afterthought. Overall though I was far from disappointed, as this gave me the most consistent amount of laughs I've had in quite some time.",Horrible Bosses
79,Seraphion,Quite unpredictable for the kind of premise it brings,5,9 October 2014,"The opening hyperbolically introduces the main characters and their abusive bosses. Not long, the movie turns into the characters deciding to kill their bosses, and that's where the main conflict happens. I like the jokes in this movie because they're not particularly stupid jokes like Will Ferrell's signature, which are still funny but looks pitiful of you think of it. The jokes do base their builds on the characters' ignorance or unpreparedness, but they don't look stupid in the execution. The twists and turns in the story's development quite helped to keep this movie interesting besides laying the backgrounds on how the jokes can be logical. Jason Bateman and Jason Sudeikis really is funny here without have to be a laughing stock or self deprecating. Charlie Day helped the work of the two Jasons well enough. Having senior names such as Kevin Spacey do increases the notch of the acting overall. Jennifer Aniston did enough in her role here as the only significant female character. Jamie Foxx and Colin Farrell adds a nice spectrum to the movie's acting.",Horrible Bosses
80,Kamurai25,Between a Rock and a Wet Place,6,11 July 2020,"Good watch, would watch again, and can recommend.This is really a great example of multi-threaded stories, obviously inspired by (hell, they even mention it) ""Strangers on a Train"", this is actually a fine idiot's version of that. Imagine a braid, but one of the strands careens off and crashes into another strand and then it completes anyways, it should look like an Escher sketch: that's this movie.It's fun. You get 3 quality actors to be some of the worst people you could write (Kevin Spacey, Jennifer Aniston, and Colin Ferrell), and, not that first 3 were funny, have 3 quality comedic actors (Jason Bateman, Jason Sudeikas, and Charlie Day) play 3 of the most flawed, average people you could write in respective situations of explosive seriousness in which they will ultimately be humiliated.I think that's a pretty good formula, and they got a sequel out of it, so I feel pretty secure in that opinion.In all respects, if this was just written with a more serious atmosphere, it could be powerful. I'm not saying taking the ""dick and fart"" jokes out of it would make it more enjoyable, but it would certainly make it more powerful.If you're a working adult, or you just like watching horrible things happen to people, I'm pretty sure you'll enjoy this one.",Horrible Bosses
81,pc95,Vulgar and Unfunny,2,9 December 2011,"A truly awful movie with no wit, full of vulgar contrived humor, we couldn't even finish half of ""Horrible Bosses"" out from the library. The wife and I started watching it and she got up at about the 15 min mark, and I stayed another 10 min. What was the first 25 min composed of? 3 men enduring phony, ludicrous, and unreasonable episodes with their bosses or work environments, and then getting together at a bar to discuss it. To compare it to ""Office Space"" would be offensive to those involved with Office Space (Aniston completely shameless in choosing this new filth). I'm not really sure it deserves a review, or even how IMDb'er can fill up 10 lines when reviewing this brainless potty-humored, crass, juvenile schlock. Thus really writing this as a warning of how not to waste your time. Put it this way, the part of ""Horrible Bosses"" we watched was worse than a lot of current Adam Sandler movies. And What is Donald Sutherland doing in this drivel too? Loss of reason. Stay away.",Horrible Bosses
82,lewiskendell,And you thought your boss was bad.,7,18 October 2011,"Horrible Bosses is one of the funniest movies I've seen this year, but it's also one of the most frustrating.The story is pretty simple. It's about three friends (Jason Bateman, Charlie Day and Jason Sudeikis) who have three different bosses (Colin Farrell, Jennifer Aniston and Kevin Spacey) who are making their lives a living hell in different ways. It gets to the point where the three guys get so frustrated that they decided to try to find a hit-man to off their superiors. That's when the shenanigans start. When Horrible Bosses focuses on the trio of bosses, it's absolutely hilarious. All three of then steal the show in their own ways, be it Spacey's pure evil, Farrell's childishness and coke-fueled hedonism, or Aniston's super-charged sexual harassment (Charlie Day gets no sympathy from me). Their part in all of this is relatively small, though, with most of the time spent on the three main guys deciding to go through with their plan and doing ""recon"". And without the bosses involved there are long stretches of jokes that fail, are recycled from other movies, or just go on too long. Bateman, Sudeikis and Day are funny, but they're just playing slight variations of characters they do so often, and they don't get most of the funniest lines. Don't get me wrong, I really liked Horrible Bosses. It just had the potential to be even better if the three funniest people in it (Spacey, Farrell and Aniston) would have been given more time to shine. Still, good movie.",Horrible Bosses
83,brando647,One of the Few Good 2011 Comedies,8,18 November 2011,"Seth Gordon's HORRIBLE BOSSES is a breath of fresh air in a summer that's had a high dose of comedies that failed to get much of a reaction from me. With the exception of BRIDESMAIDS, there really hasn't been much to laugh at in 2011 and I was ecstatic that Gordon's film was a lot funny than the trailers led me to believe. The concept isn't original (and it even plays on that with a mention of THROW MOMMA FROM THE TRAIN from the main characters) but that's to be expected anymore. It's the cast that makes this film so fun. The story centers on three friends: Nick, Dale, and Kurt. Dale slaves endlessly in his office job with hopes of eventually climbing the corporate ladder, unless his megalomaniac boss has anything to say about it. Dale is recently engaged and works as a dental assistant where sexually harassed on a daily basis by the gorgeous dentist he works under. And Kurt has recently come under hard times when his beloved boss has died and left his cokehead son behind to run the company into the ground. When enough is enough, the three hatch a scheme to murder each other's bosses with the aid of ""murder consultant"", Motherf***a Jones and it goes about as well as you would expect.The humor in the film is essentially a lot of fast-talk from the main trio (Jason Bateman, Charlie Day, and Jason Sudeikis) as they chatter over each other in hopes of getting out the better improv'd one-liners. You'll notice most scenes in the movie that feature two or more of them have them stumbling over each other's lines in a constant state of confusion. Still, the humor works. These guys are frightened, confused, and completely in over their heads in a complex murder scheme with only the most basic of advice from MF Jones (Jamie Foxx in a hilarious supporting role) to guide them through. Jason Bateman is always a safe bet for a good dose of funny, and Jason Sudeikis comes from the SNL family of comedy, which could go either way. Sudeikis is on the current SNL lineup and I haven't seen enough later episodes of the show to really form an opinion of him, but he's good here with his overactive libido and utter contempt for his coked-out tool of a boss. The wild card in the film for me was Charlie Day, as I'd never seen much ""It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia"" before this movie came out. Day was probably the funniest part of the movie in my opinion with his manic energy and total naivety. A ""registered sex offender"" for the weirdest of reasons, he has to suffer through his boss's advances knowing he won't find work anywhere else.Speaking of the bosses, I don't know a single man who would loathe a job where Jennifer Aniston routinely tried to get in his pants. Aniston completely throws away the sweetheart image she's created from her previous work to be an over-sexed dentist determined on getting herself a piece of Dale. At first it's weird hearing raunchy comedy coming from Aniston, but it works. Kevin Spacey is Nick's boss, David Harken, and let's face it...Spacey's great in any role, especially one where he's on a power trip. It's no surprise that the film works him into the position as the primary antagonist. Finally, there's Colin Farrell as Kurt's boss, Bobby Pellitt. Farrell is over-the-top hilarious in a way that I never would've expected to come from him. I never saw him as a comedy type but he knocks you out here with his crappy comb-over and his shoddy karate kicks. He gets the best lines in the film for what little we get him. It's unfortunate but Farrell gets the least screen-time of all the bosses.HORRIBLE BOSSES isn't going to find itself on many top 10 lists but it's great for some laughs. It's the most entertaining comedy to come out all year and one of the few times I've found myself laughing in the theater. The cast are superb and the antics are fast-paced. I doubt it's going to find any cult status and it may even be forgotten by this time next year but I think it's worth a viewing for those who've found our selection of good 2011 comedies to be slim pickings.",Horrible Bosses
84,moviewizguy,Ever wish your boss were dead?,7,5 July 2011,"For Nick, Kurt, and Dale, the only thing that would make the daily grind more tolerable would be to grind their intolerable bosses into dust. Quitting is not an option, so, with the benefit of a few-too-many drinks and some dubious advice from a hustling ex-con, the three friends devise a convoluted and seemingly foolproof plan to rid themselves of their respective employers...permanently. There's only one problem: even the best laid plans are only as foolproof as the brains behind them. -- (C) Warner BrosAs many Hitchcock films have shown us (like STRANGERS ON A TRAIN, DIAL M FOR MURDER, and VERTIGO), even the best laid plans have loopholes. No matter how perfect the plan seem to be, there's usually some incidental human error involved that messes everything up. HORRIBLE BOSSES takes this concept with a dark comedic twist, and it works really well! Even with the mean-spirited feel of the film that has been so common among comedies these days, the film successfully contains consistent laughs through and through, which already puts it above 75% of comedies released in the past several years.The film works because of the TERRIFIC cast, with Charlie Day standing out the most. While he only had a supporting role in GOING THE DISTANCE, he has a much bigger role here, and he steals the freaking show! He does everything in here to get some big laughs from the audience, and he doesn't disappoint. I can easily see him in a starring role within the next few years. I also enjoyed Jason Sudeikis' antics as the sex-addicted friend. However, I didn't think Jason Bateman was any special. He's just Jason Bateman.It's great to see Jennifer Aniston in a different role, although she's still in a comedy. It was refreshing to see her with a sexy, skanky attitude (matched with her darker brunette hair) compared to her several previous ""good girl"" roles. Kevin Spacey and Colin Farrell also seemed to have tons of fun playing baddies as well. With a short screen presence, Jamie Foxx continues the pattern with delivering some good laughs.Story-wise, HORRIBLE BOSSES has its shares of ups and downs. The upside is that you really don't know how the film will end. I thought I knew where it was going, but then a plot twist came up to surprise me which took the film in a completely different direction. The downside is that the film contains some plot contrivances that were really hard to swallow and an all-too-convenient, abrupt ending to top it all. I didn't want it to end so soon.With those minor flaws, HORRIBLE BOSSES is not only better than ""horrible,"" it's a lot better than ""horrible."" In fact, it's quite good -- a dark comedy that delivers some really great laughs due to the excellent cast that manages to give it their all into making a good film. In the end, HORRIBLE BOSSES, while not amazing, is better and more memorable than most modern comedies these days.",Horrible Bosses
85,bkrauser-81-311064,Whose the Boss Now?,8,10 November 2011,"Who hasn't worked for a horrible boss at least once in their lives? You know the types; incompetent, exploitative, crass, mean-spirited, theirs a wide spectrum of adjectives to describe people who may not deserve the positions they have achieved. Wouldn't it be nice if they were taken out of the picture? That's what this black comedy asks, brought to you by an up-and-coming director and a cavalcade of talented stars.The story revolves around three working stiffs: Jason Bateman, Jason Sudeikis and Charlie Day. One works for a megalomaniac slave driver (Kevin Spacey), another for a drug-addled idiot (Colin Farrell) while the third works for a crazed nymphomaniac (Jennifer Aniston). Stuck where they are for various reasons they discuss their laundry list of workplace grievances concluding their bosses need to take a long dirt nap. They then wonder into the bad side of town to hire a murder consultant (Jamie Foxx) soon realizing the best laid plans never go smoothly.The energy of ""Horrible Bosses"" is what sets the movie apart from other R-rated comedies. Bateman, Sudeikis and Day have a natural chemistry and gift for comedy lobbing jokes off each other like a professional three-way tennis match. The films vivacity doesn't let up when introducing our primary villains either. Each take their respective tropes to farce levels and seem to have a lot of fun doing it. Jennifer Aniston in particular seems to take relish in torturing her assistant going so far as to stripping down to only a lab coat in front of him.Seth Gordon is a director to watch for in the future. Like a old pro, Gordon has a steady hand and confidence not seen in many comedic directors. While many like Adam McKay and Jay Roach become indulgent, distracting from the plot with anarchic comedy bits, Gordon wisely trims the fat to balance time between the three major conflicts.It would have been nice to see a little more of the supporting players which include Donald Sutherland, Bob Newhart, Ioan Gruffudd and especially Jamie Foxx. Additionally the script is surprisingly light for such dark subject matter as evidenced when the body count starts to rise.Still ""Horrible Bosses"" remains the best mainstream comedy to come out this summer. It's energetic, timely and of course downright hilarious.http://theyservepopcorninhell.blogspot.com/",Horrible Bosses

87,Troy_Campbell,Offensive and funny.,7,30 August 2011,"I must admit I was hesitant before seeing Horrible Bosses; such was the blandness of the trailer. I was pleasantly surprised then, to find myself laughing constantly during this offensive movie. The simple premise – three ordinary blokes decide to kill their abusive bosses – is pillaged for every possible drop of humour, with the hits more prevalent than the misses. Whilst the ribald dialogue is well written, and you sense well ad-libbed, the major source of hilarity is the against-type performances of Jennifer Aniston and Colin Farrell. Aniston is in career-best form as an atrociously inappropriate dentist (you won't believe some of the phrases that come out of her mouth) and Farrell turns in an arsehole to end all arseholes. Other than Charlie Day's excruciatingly annoying voice, this is a solid comedy worth seeing with the masses.",Horrible Bosses
88,oneguyrambling,Exactly what you expect when you watch the trailer. The relevance of that comment is up to you.,5,1 March 2012,"Nick (Jason Bateman) is an extremely hard worker who is very good at his job. He has a Horrible Boss (Kevin Spacey) who dangles a big promotion like a carrot to a mule.Dale (Charlie Day) is a loyal worker who is soon to be married. He has a Horrible Boss (Jennifer Aniston) who talks dirty and menaces him sexually.Kurt is a hard working second in command in a family owned and run company. He has a great boss who respects him and values his ideas and input.No wait. Not for long. That wouldn't work in the movie.Kurt has a Horrible Boss (Colin Farrell) who is lazy and cares only about himself, drugs and hookers. In fact it is very likely that he will soon run his late Father's beloved company into the ground.Phew. That's better.So here we have it, three spineless gits who for various tissue thin reasons feel obligated to stay in their current crummy environments regardless of how much they hate working under their respective HB's, so over one too many beers one evening they hatch a plan to kill them instead.The 'genius' in their plans is that to avoid being implicated each man will kill one of the other's boss. Of course this will lead the forensics a merry dance and ensure that no-one will be caught.So with this threadbare premise established the ill equipped trio start ham-fistedly stalking, surveiling and scheming against their unpleasant superiors, with the usual bumblings and (always bad) coincidences and ridiculous turns and twists that such actions demand in these films.It seems that every time a scene or situation builds a tiny bit of momentum something dumb or overly predictable manages to instantly highlight the fact that this film is a blatantly commercial cash grab.Strangely enough in these films the three leads are largely gormless personality free idiots, it is in fact the three Horrible Bosses who manage to bring a faint hint of laughter to proceedings. Kevin Spacey plays his absolute bastard role to the hilt, bringing not a skerrick of compassion or decency to his over the top character. Aniston too manages to be suitably smarmy to the point where every woman in the audience is positive that their man would succumb to her persistence - and every man insists no while imagining the possibilities of the dentist's chair...). But the real story here is Colin Farrell in his fat suit and combover hairpiece, his womanizing carefree dick is simultaneously hilarious and repugnant, in fact I have no idea why he has the briefest role out of the 6 leads.The only other character of note is Jamie Foxx as a guy from a seedy neighbourhood who the guys go to for advice, a man who berates them for thinking that all African Americans are well versed in the ways of crime (while ignoring the fact that he met them in a seedy bar and offered his services, namely his expertise in the ways of crime).I liked parts of the film, the Jamie Foxx scenes are actually pretty funny and some of the scenes involving the Horrible Bosses practically demand that the actors go to absurd lengths to help substantiate the evil thoughts of the underlings, and they set to the tasks with gusto. But in reality Horrible Bosses is merely another piece of cinematic filler hastily created to make a quick dollar or two from the non-discerning. It has precious few surprises and only warrants a few chuckles, but that said it is a fair effort, but then that's hardly going to be the comment that goes on the poster is it? While I am here I sincerely hope that Charlie Day was acting as if he has a shrill, annoying, whiny scratchy voice. I have not watched his sit-com and don't intend to, so this is my only direct exposure to him thus far. If I happen to come across him in another film and he clicks back into Bobcat Goldthwaite mode it might prove my last.If you liked this review (or even if you didn't) check out oneguyrambling.com for over 800 reviews and plenty more good stuff...",Horrible Bosses
89,napierslogs,Adding crude and sexual content to make a plot-rich story funny,8,8 July 2011,"In the vein of ""The Hangover"" (2009), ""Horrible Bosses"" has three friends taking a wild trip to—well, jail, most likely. They mean well, but when you spend your free time drinking at a bar complaining about your bosses, reckless plans are bound to be hatched. But I'm glad they do. It's a premise with lots of possibilities, never quite knowing which turns they would take, and they were all hilarious.The wild heights they reach are mostly with profanity and sexual explicitness. In fact, there's an entire scene about where the ""line"" is and if they've crossed it. As you can guess, that line has long since been crossed, re-drawn and repeatedly crossed.At the beginning we meet our three protagonists, Nick (Jason Bateman), Dale (Charlie Day) and Kurt (Jason Sudeikis) working in decent jobs but for crazy assholes. Their bosses all have titles, but it would be wrong of me to string that many expletives together.They're not being serious about killing their bosses, but before we know it they're putting together haphazard, drunken plans. It's the type of story that seems plausible at first but then somewhere along the way, we don't really know where, reality is thrown out the window. It's an R-rated comedy where the plot is central, characters are secondary but still important, and last but not least there are funny lines. For that, it's smart.The dark comedy works because of the ensemble of characters, the three hapless adventurists and their really horrible bosses, each played by actors who can say comedy lines with straight faces and aren't scared to get dirty. Some are just really good and what they normally do, like Bateman as the normal, straight man and Sudeikis as the obnoxious womanizer. While others are stepping out of their comfort zone and showing some real comedy skills, like Jennifer Aniston as an over-the-top, inappropriate seductress and Colin Farrell as a skinny, coked-out criminal. Kevin Spacey, equally adept at comedy and drama, is of course great here. I don't know Charlie Day all that well but he made me laugh in ""Going the Distance"" and he made me laugh really hard here. His whiny voice is perfect for the role of Dale because he's manic and paranoid to begin with but with his head in a bowl of cocaine he's going to need to become even more manic and paranoid.""Horrible Bosses"" is more silly than it is dark as the crimes occur after we've been removed from reality.

92,hall895,A comedy that's far from horrible,7,5 December 2014,"Kevin Spacey, Jennifer Aniston and Colin Farrell play three horrible bosses. Jason Bateman, Charlie Day and Jason Sudeikis play their respective mistreated employees. One night over drinks these employees get the bright idea to kill their bosses. Well, it seemed like a bright idea anyway. Their plans inevitably go awry, these are not guys well-equipped to plot murders. The laughs come fast and furious as their plot unravels. Who knew attempted murder could be so hilarious? The movie sets up a reasonably interesting story and then the excellent cast takes that story and runs with it. It is the performances that really make Horrible Bosses work. Each of the six key figures fits into their role wonderfully. Spacey is a treat in playing a sadistic executive at a financial firm. Aniston is both funny and sexy in playing a man-eating dentist. And Farrell effortlessly disappears into the body of a clueless, cocaine-binging schlub. But while the bosses are great it's their murderous employees who really carry the movie, we spend much more time with them. Bateman, as he does so often, largely plays the straight man which suits him perfectly as he reacts to all the chaos swirling around him. Sudeikis is terrifically witty, delivering deadpan humor in a way that always brings a smile to your face. And Day may be the best of all. Perhaps the least known of all the film's stars he threatens to steal the whole show. There's something endearingly offbeat about his character and Day captures that so well. The chemistry between Day, Sudeikis and Bateman is terrific. You really pull for these guys, and laugh with them, even as they plot a triple homicide. The fact they bumble things all the way through obviously helps with the laughs.While not a perfect comedy Horrible Bosses ultimately is a very satisfying one. Perhaps we could have spent a little more time with the bosses, there was probably some comedic potential there left untapped. Farrell in particular gets short shrift, he is definitely underused. And if you have Kevin Spacey playing a deranged psychopath there's so much more you can do with him than this movie does. But all in all the movie works. What the performers are given to do they all do very well. Day may be the standout, and Aniston memorably blows her good girl image to smithereens in hilarious fashion, but all six of the film's stars deserve a lot of credit. It's a winning ensemble enhanced by one supporting character, the ""murder consultant"" our bumbling idiots hire. That character adds a few more laughs to the movie's impressive comic mix. This is a comedy with great energy, great laughs, great characters and just enough story to keep the whole thing moving forward. The bosses may be horrible but the movie about them is pretty great.",Horrible Bosses
93,thekarmicnomad,More than Nine to Five,7,19 June 2012,This film feels like a rehash of several other movies mushed into one (the characters even agree) but it does work. The performances are top notch and Jennifer Aniston made me triple check the back of the DVD box several times before I would believe it actually was her.The film is fairly inoffensive reallying on situation farce with a sprinkling of vagina gags. It all worked really well in all and keeps you guessing to a certain extent.The only issues I had was one of the characters seems to take a Jekyllesque personality change half way through the movie; and it does run out of steam before the credits roll.All in all not bad at all,Horrible Bosses
94,phubbs,Horrible Bosses,10,16 October 2014,"Well what have we here...a film with an original plot AND Jennifer Aniston actually growing up and acting like a proper woman for once. Lets really add to this and point out that the whole cast, including the overrated Farrell, was actually very very good and the humour was pretty smart.So what we have here is a very good comedy with a large number of the cast being small name stars! I still can't believe it, the film started slow I gotta say, wasn't really getting into it, the guys are living crappy lives due their nasty chiefs so they all decide to bump them off...meh. Then on comes Aniston offering to fudge the living daylights outta Day and telling him to fudge her slutty mouth!!! what am I seeing?! Aniston actually using her sexy girl next door looks for some adult humour at last.I may as well point out that every scene with Day, Bateman and Sudeikis was an absolute pleasure to watch and extremely funny yet I've never even heard of any of them. Every scene and every line was just so chuckletastic you can't fail to smile, the comedy was sharp, witty and with some slapstick but not over the top and childish. The villains of the piece were all fantastic too, Farrell, Aniston (who also starred in the similar genre flick 'Office Space') and Spacey all showing great comic evilness, some of the best casting I've seen for a while.I really didn't hold much hope for this film to be honest, heard a lot but assumed it was all over the top hype, how could it be so good with that cast? so I was wrong I admit it.Pretty much a perfect little comedy of horrors that is simple yet original and doesn't get carried away with overblown sequences. The only thing that kept popping into my mind was how gay Day's character was. Who in their right mind wouldn't let Aniston have her wicked way like that?! she could blackmail me like that any day.10/10",Horrible Bosses
95,KnightsofNi11,More generic brand comedy,5,25 July 2011,"Movies with the most hilarious seeming concept often produce the most disappointing results. Such is the case of Horrible Bosses, a film about three blundering idiots who decide to kill their own bosses who make each of their lives a living hell. The three leads are Jason Bateman, Charlie Day, and Jason Sudeikis, a trio that can deliver plenty of funny lines and dish out some amusing banter, but lack a lot of chemistry to make them a believable trio of friends. The bosses are played by Kevin Spacey, Jennifer Aniston, and Colin Farrell who I can say all make entertaining, albeit over-the-top, villains. Horrible Bosses is good for a few laughs, but not much else.The premise of the film is really what drew me into this film along with the cast which I am a big fan of except for Jennifer Aniston who was surprisingly one of the better characters in the film. Anyways, this film has a premise that is a bit ridiculous but has the potential to deliver some hysterical scenarios. Horrible Bosses doesn't really take advantage of this and ends up being another generic comedy that just goes through the motions of a sub-par gag flick. It is an R rated film so thankfully it doesn't have to hold back on the raunchiness, paving the way for a lot more laughs than a PG-13 stamp would have merited.Horrible Bosses is really nothing more than a middle of the road comedy that you won't remember long after you see it. It's simple minded and unoriginal, never tossing in a plot point that will throw you for a loop. You can easily predict everything before it happens and there's nothing that will really take you by surprise. It's a film that offers too many easy solutions to difficult situations and problems, cheating itself out of more hilarious scenarios that could have gotten a much bigger laugh. The story line offers up problems and then shoots them down with incredibly simplistic and unbelievable solutions that highlight the film's laziness and drain it of its creativity. It hurts to watch this film commit comedic suicide, but you have to sit back and watch it anyways.I'll admit that I laughed at Horrible Bosses and I didn't hate the film but it really just doesn't have much to offer. I feel like this film could have been a lot better but due to its lack of creativity and the severe absence of originality this film has joined the ranks of all the forgettable comedies that we see so that we can laugh once or twice and then move on with our lives.

It's an excellent farce with some original twists about three guys who hate their bosses and decide to kill them. It's silly and funny and well done with good performances by all. Kevin Spacey does an excellent ""boss from hell"" and Jennifer Aniston is great as a nymphomaniac dentist. (Why was Donald Sutherland's role so brief?) But... Is the constant stream of profanity necessary. Does the F word, used endlessly, really add to the humour. The movie could have been just as funny without all the foul language. There are some terrific situations here that would have worked just as well without the potty mouth stuff. We've reached a sad moment if film producers feel a movie won't sell without gratuitous profanity.",Horrible Bosses
98,eminkl,It's just too bad this genuinely funny comedy ran over a nail going into the final reel,7,14 December 2019,"Talk about riding a wave of success, Jason Bateman (who should have been Gil in Woody Allen's Midnight in Paris) is in everything these days. It's just too bad this genuinely funny comedy ran over a nail going into the final reel, because otherwise there is a lot to like here. The set-up is enjoyable, showcasing the villainy of the three bosses; Colin Farrell is a particular standout as the hilariously detestable son of Donald Sutherland, who begins the pillaging of his father's company while Sutherland's funeral isn't even over yet. The break-in of his ""lair"" was the comedic highlight for me. A lot has been made of Aniston's break from her usual girl-next-door roles to play crude-talking, sexually harassing dentist Julia Harris, D.D.S., and she does well, but it has to be filed under ""as expected"" from someone with her comedic resume. Unfortunately the wheels fall off near the end while trying to deliver main baddie Kevin Spacey his comeuppance.",Horrible Bosses
99,Ruskington,Lame offensive drivel,4,29 April 2020,"This is actually a decent concept for a comedy, but like so many other mainstream Hollywood films this century, it falls painfully short. The three main characters are borderline tropes and Charlie Day is particularly atrocious, overcooking every line. Jennifer Aniston's character is completely over the top and the sexual abuse gender reversal dynamic is a horrific miscalculation by the writers. People being upset with this theme is not a a case of political correctness gone mad, it is a rational reaction to a distasteful and unacceptable part of the movie.This is a film that tries to be dark and edgy but is still just predictable formulaic vulgarity. It's a huge shame to see talented actors like Kevin Spacey, Jamie Foxx and Jason Bateman drawn into these lowbrow films as they are all capable of so much more.",Horrible Bosses
100,aesgaard41,Horribly Entertaining,8,13 November 2012,"It's not often that an actor like Jason Bateman succeeds in both the small screen and the big screen. TV stars don't always make good movie stars, and movie stars can often be constrained by the limits of TV to really showcase their talents. In ""Horrible Bosses,"" Jason basically plays Michael Bluth, his character from ""Arrested Development,"" but in this incarnation, he's trapped in employment limbo and being kept from a raise and position in his company that he knows he deserves and that his boss wants to keep him from in order to keep him in servitude. Kevin Spacey plays his power-hungry boss and seems to be having fun in the tyrannical role portraying a sadist who delights in the misery of others just for the delight of being mean and nasty. Bateman is joined by Jason Sudekis and Charlie Day as his wildly irreverent friends. Jennifer Aniston is barely recognizable as the sex-crazed dentist, but she's still smoking hot as she goes through oozing sex. Colin Farrell is also altered to fit his character, but he is still recognizable as the Irish miscreant seen in so many of his movies. In this broad remake of ""Strangers On A Train,"" Bateman, Sudekis and Day conspire to kill off each other's employers, advised by Jaime Fox whose character is not quite the criminal they believe he is. The best part of the movie is that the guys finally get the solutions to their problems, but not by actually murdering anyone, but by just sheer dumb luck and improbable situations that could only happen in the movie universe. This dark comedy has a great script, funny lines, enjoyable characters and a satisfactory conclusion that opens itself to new revelations. That's what makes the movie for me, setting up the stage to wonder what happens next without necessarily suggesting a sequel.",Horrible Bosses

The story line and the writing were very original and clever making this movie hilarious and interesting. All the actors did a great job and there were so laugh out loud moments.This movie is about 3 friends who each has a horrible boss.

Read the full IMDb Storyline and you'll have a pretty good idea of what the plan to make you laugh is. The cast does not take itself too seriously; they play as if they were on a stage, not in front of cameras and it is clear they are having a great time. For a while, I was waiting for the cast to provide us with a little of that fun they seem to enjoy. During that time I was having doubts it could shift in gear to make us laugh. It took a short while but we got there; once there, you can relax and enjoy the not so predictable twists that make it so funny. I say this because I felt the early parts were somewhat predictable. The outcome was a flow of small but sure little surprises you could not predict, each funnier than the previous. You are happy to let the story roll on its own without playing the game of guessing.The three victims of horrible bosses, friends from school are not great deserving employees, but yes, their bosses are the scum of the earth. Colin Farrell was the poster boss for what horrible bosses can be; he was, all things consider the only one who deserved to be taken out. Kevin Spacey was the kind of boss who is his worst enemy, by his behaviour. Jennifer Aniston was my favourite bad boss, as I'm sure most guys will agree. That vixen filthy minded and dirty talking boss was the one we all wanted to see more of. She relentlessly sexually harassed poor Charlie Day. His two buddies would have gladly have traded place with him, so his boss' demise was low in the priority to dispose of her. Spacey and Farrell through stupid luck in favour of Nick and Kurt, played by Jason Bateman and Jason Sudeikis, are respectively murdered; in the case of Farrell, by Spacey and in Spacey's case he gets charged for that crime. How Dale (Charlie Day) manages to put an end to the slut boss Jennifer Aniston is cute and precious. It was a fun movie.

107,Likes_Ninjas90,The first quarter of this film is diabolically unfunny,5,17 August 2011,"Three friends are being taunted at work by their merciless bosses. Nick (Jason Bateman) works in an office and is bullied by Dave (Kevin Spacey). Dale (Charlie Day), who is engaged, is a nurse resisting the advances of dentist Dr. Julia Harris (Jennifer Aniston). And Kurt (Jason Sudeikis) is employed in a chemical factory. He's tormented by his new boss Bobby (Colin Farrell), who has taken over, after his own father (Donald Sutherland) dies in a car accident. He's a sex and drugs maniac. These blokes are so frustrated with their jobs that they plot to kill their bosses and decide to hire a hit-man to help them. They are ripped off by a criminal who calls himself 'Motherfucker' (Jamie Foxx) because he takes their money, only to give them some limp advice. They decide that they will kill each other's boss themselves so that there won't be any motives or links to the crimes. Why doesn't this fleeting comedy work? It has several heavyweight names attached to it and a concept that I am sure many people would find agreeable. The problem here is with the bosses themselves and the type of comedy that director Seth Gordon (Community) has tried to employ. Like so many American comedies it relies too much on obvious humour and implausible dialogue. Each of the three bosses is so extreme and unlikely that any credibility is taken out of the picture. The way they speak and act in this film is out of touch with reality. Take Jennifer Aniston's character in her first scene. While standing over an unconscious patient, she starts telling Dale about her nether region and starts squirting his pants with water to see his penis. And in a later scene she traps Dale in her office, while wearing nothing but her underpants and a white coat. It's an embarrassing and thankless role that's neither funny nor clever. It borders precariously on offensive. Spacey and Farrell are equally cartoonish too. I didn't buy for a second the way that Dave spoke to Nick in the office, calling him his 'bitch', saying that he owns him and literally knocking down walls so that he can extend his own office. Farrell probably gets the least amount of time and his order for Kurt to fire some of the fat people and disabled people makes him a pretty lame villain. Adding to the woes is the film's tendency to make light of subjects like rape and sex offenders. A running 'joke' in the film is that Dale is a registered sex offender because he urinated one night in a playground. Ultimately, the first quarter of this film is diabolically unfunny. What's also a stretch for the plot is that the boys never approach any other method of dealing with their problems. No one else in the office seems to notice or talk about this outlandish behaviour. There doesn't seem to be anyone to complain to. The jump to murder is a pretty extreme and ridiculous conclusion. Perhaps if the boys had more of a life outside of work they wouldn't be so miserable. The characters are underwritten because apart from Dale being engaged they don't seem to have inner lives outside of their jobs. They don't have any other friends and they spend most of their time together eating and drinking at a bar. But thankfully, very thankfully, what saves the film are some of the laughs that come in the second half. I don't know a lot about Charlie Day but this guy does hysteria very well and he actually made me laugh more times than I expected at that point. And it's a shame Jamie Foxx doesn't have more scenes because he's actually a great asset to the film too. His scenes are funny because he plays the comedy straight, trying to be a tough gangster figure. This gives the boys something to play off because they're chatty but trying to take him seriously. Just listen to the way Bateman tires to address him by his street name 'Motherfucker'. The way he drops that line is just hilarious and I wish the film gave him more of this deadpan humour to work with. He really needed more jokes in this film. And given the way that the film ends on a very mean-spirited note I can't recommend it on just a handful of big laughs.",Horrible Bosses
108,Christian_Dimartino,The actors really make this shine.,8,10 September 2011,"2011 has been a mixed bag for comedy. We've had movies like Bridesmaids, the funniest film of the year, and films like Your highness, which was dreadful. We also had The Hangover Part II, but that doesn't belong near Bridesmaids or Horrible bosses, the one I just saw.In a lot of recent comedies, there is always a scene stealer. In The Hangover, it was Zach Galifianakis. In Bridesmaids, it was Melissa McCarthy. But in Horrible bosses, there wasn't just one actor. All of the main actors glow. Nick, Dale, and Kurt(Jason Bateman, Charlie Day, and Jason Sudeikis)all hate their bosses. Nick's boss(Kevin Spacey) is cruel. Dale's boss(Jennifer Aniston, looking hotter than ever) sexually harasses him and Kurt's boss(Colin Farrell) has a blow problem and doesn't care about his company, and is cruel also.So, they decide that they want to kill their bosses. But obviously they have no experience, so thats what the film goes off of. They receive advice from Mother f**ker Jones(Jamie Foxx), a hit man, while they look for intel on their bosses.Horrible bosses takes its premise seriously, and has a lot of fun with it. The film is a total blast. Its one of those films that you can tell that the cast is having a lot of fun making it. But luckily for us, we're having fun too.All of the actors here have an enormous talent. Bateman isn't a household name yet, but someday he will. He's pretty awesome. So is Charlie Day, who steals the show on his TV show, It's always sunny in Philadelphia, and Sudeikis is also talented on SNL. The whole cast is marvelous, and the teamwork that they provide makes Horrible bosses a comic gem that shouldn't be overlooked. Put this, not in front of Bridesmaids, but definitely in front of The Hangover 1 and 2... one of the year's funniest films.A-",Horrible Bosses

It's got Kevin Spacey wasting his talents in some dumb comedy when he needs to be in more serious movies and a total waste of his talents. Jason Bateman basically just plays the exact same character or at least the same persona for a character in every movie he's in. Probably the best thing about the whole movie is Jamie Foxx in his bit role, but he's only a few scenes.

The script takes on the challenge, creating work situations with which many people can identify, and with feelings of frustration, despair and revenge that we have all had but never carry out, of course. We need the fantasy, and this movie is the fantasy.This is not a comedy that reinvents the genre, it is not a witty movie, or white humour, is every-day humour with all the stereotypes and nuances that we want in a movie when we want to LOL at ease.The movie succeeds because it has a classic funny script with formulas that work in comedy and, especially, because the cast fits like puzzle pieces and there is chorus working to make you laugh, instead of a hero comedian trying you to get his/her humour. I especially liked some of the bad bosses :)) Kevin Spacey as the psychopathic posh boss, and the biggest surprise to me was Jennifer Aston; I'm not a fan of her at all, but she she is great as the sassy horrible dominatrix dentist boss.I had a great time watching this film.

113,Rickting,"Unoriginal, but well played and often funny",7,18 April 2015,"Horrible Bosses is a dark comedy involving 3 friends who conspire to murder their 3 dreadful bosses. HB doesn't look too out of the ordinary, but surprisingly it works although it's far from perfect. A piece of commentary of the recession, which thankfully doesn't shove this point down your throat and keeps it as a subtle background theme, HB uses dark humour to get its laughs and initially it's difficult to get behind the 3 protagonists, but at the same time they are likable characters and the film goes in a different direction than what you're expecting. As the 3 leads, Jason Bateman, Charlie Day and Jason Sudeikis are entertaining and relatable, while Jamie Foxx makes his mark with a small but still memorable role as a criminal adviser. The 3 bosses are fairly 2 dimensional villains; Kevin Spacey is very good and his character is an entertainingly horrible boss, but Jennifer Anniston's character is too exaggerated while Colin Farrell's character is both too exaggerated and wasted. Suffering occasionally from the mean spirited, OTT jokes which often plague adult comedies, HB also occasionally takes plot turns which just don't make any sense.HB is still funny though, and with a neat running time it's a story you can get invested in without having to pay too much attention. Many of the jokes are funny and a scene involving an assassin who turns out not to be an assassin is very funny. A certain aspect of the ending is illogical, although the conclusion is still satisfying. It's well directed and the screenplay is mostly well written and manages to be funny instead of mean spirited. The Hangover this ain't, but HB is an effective and fitfully nourishing comedy which delivers on the laughs, doesn't run out of steam and manages to keep you guessing about what's going to happen next. It won't cater to all tastes and some will inevitably find offensive. Personally, I think it's pretty offensive at times, but only in a silly, jokey way. Overall, the film is fairly safe and standard in some ways, and doesn't do anything we haven't seen before but not every film needs to be an innovator. Overall, I enjoyed Horrible Bosses.

It is actually a great premise but is seriously badly done. It is crude in the extreme and all the foul language does not make it any funnier. There are moments when one can see what might have been but they are few and far between. Jennifer Aniston has great comic timing but employing her to use such crudity is a waste of her talent. Obviously none of this was aimed at my demographic as I am too offended by the gratuitous use of the ""f"" word amongst other profanities I know no-one that uses language like this so liberally - I do swear myself so to be offended by swearing seems ludicrous but when it is not real it jars.

They are fantastic, and were the main redeeming feature of the film. Their characters were pretty funny and that's where most of the comedy lay for me. I wasn't that convinced with Charlie Day's character.

It was a surprisingly star studded cast with some great cameos, all giving us something different and contributing to a varied character list.But like I've said, I found the whole thing pretty generic.

118,estreet-eva,Another work-themed disappointing outing from Jason Bateman,4,3 January 2012,"While not as inexcusably awful as Jason Bateman's foray into the manufacturing sector in ""Extract"", he hasn't exactly exonerated himself with the workplace comedy ""Horrible Bosses."" To be fair, it's not Bateman but the bosses that don't quite work here. While the usually excellent Kevin Spacey's exploitative boss does ring true, Bateman's character wants his dead largely because he wants his job. This motivation would work better in a noir rather than a comedy. Nice-girl Jennifer Aniston takes a crack at playing dark as a newer comedy-stereotype-the perverted dentist. The problem here is that the writers need to twist themselves into knots, even putting their protagonist on the sexual offenders registry, to explain why her male dental hygienist would reject her advances. Why not just make the character gay? It would have made so much more sense and provided an interesting dynamic. The third horrible boss played by Colin Farrell spends so little time on the screen, we are not clear why he needs to become a target of a murder plot. The movie does get points for being upfront about the lack of moral rectitude of the three main characters who are, after all, resorting to murder to make their working lives more pleasant. Similarly, it is upfront about the ""soft"" racism of the three white, male, early-middle aged characters in their interactions with Jamie Foxx as a con man and an Indian technical support rep who is central to the end of the film. The film may be among the last that will be able to try to wring most of its funny out of prolonged sequences of wild profanity. The shock value of shocking language has largely lost much of its voltage through overuse and increasing familiarity. In short, the far more subtle horror of the bosses in ""Office Space"" or Sigourney Weaver's fashionista in ""Working Girl"" far better earn a homicidal fate.",Horrible Bosses

123,diac228,"I'll take my comedy raw, blackened, with a side of crazy please.",9,9 July 2011,"Murder. Car chases. Scandal. Rape. Conspiracy. Blackmail. Revenge. These are usually the key words to a suspenseful drama, but in this case are applied to a dark comedy that is relentless, chaotic, and just as funny as advertised. Horrible Bosses is the type of movie that would make Danny DeVito proud, as it blends a fun plot full of fun twists with standout comedic performances, plenty of surprises, and the inability to ever become predictable. Unlike most recent R-rated comedies, this film is raunchy without truly crossing the line, profane without becoming redundant and outrageous without becoming tedious. Don't look now but this movie is legitimately funny, and among the better comedies released in quite some time.Horrible Bosses is about three average joes (Jason Bateman, Charlie Day, Jason Sudeikis) that are stuck on their job with awful bosses (Kevin Spacey, Jennifer Aniston, Colin Ferrell) all for different reasons. After all three reach their breaking point, they decide that their lives would be better if their bosses ceased to exist. What follows is their hilarious efforts in finding a way to get it done without getting caught. The premise was promising and thanks to a fresh script by Michael Markovitz, John Daly, and Jonathan Goldstein, the potential was indeed delivered—although not in the ways you'd expect.The cast is hands-down the standout reason why this movie works. As a matter of fact its also its one minor flaw because we have tons of talent that were not utilized enough because some of the performances were so hilarious in the minimal material given. The bosses themselves were convincingly awful, especially the always-reliable Kevin Spacey as this sadistic, manipulative, and extremely cruel president of a company. Colin Ferrell and Jennifer Aniston step out of their usual roles and surprisingly deliver plenty of laughs with their own cruelly aggressive mannerisms. The main three also provided plenty of laughs and played off each other perfectly well, with Charlie Day being the best of the three. Day's experience with the mildly-dark ""It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia"" definitely shows off here, as his whiny and high-pitched voice perfectly matches his character persona and offers the most laughs and one-liners.Seth Gordon's resume as director has been an interesting one; ranging from the enjoyable Fistful of Quarters to the weak-weak Four Christmases. In here, he keeps the pace constantly quick, constantly throws a crazy scenario to pit our heroes in, and never gives you a chance to breathe and realize how preposterous this movie really is. The movie's raunchiness is matched by its grim sense of humor—you need a dark strong heart to laugh at some of the mean-spirited shtick that is embedded in the 100 minute timeframe. In this movie, nobody is safe, and you never know just what might happen next. Unpredictability is essential in comedy, and the best part of Horrible Bosses is how it can remain one step ahead of you while still giving plenty to laugh about. We are laughing at our heroes but secretly we are definitely rooting for them too. Yes folks, you will secretly be hoping that they do indeed do the dirty deed.Bottom Line: The talent pool runs deep here, and is the main reason why the film works. Luckily for us and the cast, they also got to work with great pacing, a fun script, and fresh dark humor that can inject life in this dismal summer season. The underrated talent of Sudekis, Day, and Bateman continue to quietly shine in Hollywood as they are hilarious from the first second to the closing credits. But let's not forget the triple-villain team of Aniston, Spacey, and Ferrell, which infused even more humor (and craziness) into the comedy. To sum it up, the film works in its dark manner, as Horrible Bosses never takes itself seriously, but you'll be too deep into laughter to notice the difference. The movie is dark as the movie earned its R rating easily, but if you can handle it you are in for a uproarious ride. Keep an eye on this one, as it is one of the best summer surprises in recent years.",Horrible Bosses
124,DavidYZ,Jennifer Aniston is brilliant,7,21 April 2017,This black comedy film is about three employees who have awful bosses whom they hate. They decide that the best solution to their work problems is to kill them. Jennifer Aniston is brilliant as one of the bosses - a slutty dentist who tries to seduce and blackmail her assistant into having sex with her.,Horrible Bosses
125,Okonh0wp,Kind of rushed but pretty fun. Great chemistry,8,7 June 2013,"That was one enticing trailer that ""Horrible Bosses"" offered. Unfortunately, many of the best jokes were in the trailer. And it's worth pointing out that the trailer was misleading. It's not a film about three people trying to murder their bosses. That's really just the first act of the story. Maybe it's because the film switches directions in so many spots, that the film feels kind of rushed.The film is still pretty solid. Jason Sudeikis, Charlie Day, and Jason Bateman are three talented actors (Sudeikis and Day really prove themselves movie-worthy here) and the trio has Hangover-like levels of chemistry. Kevin Spacey and Colin Farrell have a lot of fun hamming it up as villains. On the whole, I just wish it ran a little longer",Horrible Bosses
126,nickmesafilms,Horrible Bosses (2011) - I Really Hate My Boss So Much!,9,11 October 2011,"Three bosses. You hate them a lot. You go out on a murder mission, and then everything goes haywire! That is the diabolical laugh-out-loud plot to ""Horrible Bosses"". But to be more specific, the movie is mainly about these three guys who each have three horrible bosses, and they set up a plan with the Jamie Foxx character to kill their bosses, which leads into so much mayhem. Anyways, ""Horrible Bosses"" is one of the funniest movies ever since ""The Hangover"". The plot is crystal perfect, the script is hilariously well-written, and the raunchiness is funny as ever. But what impressed me the most, was the hilarious casting ensemble of some of the best actors you can hire for a movie. But just to fit the occasion, I'll arrange the cast like this: THE DUDES: Jason Sudeikis knows his comedy skills, and he can do anything that involves being funny. Jason Bateman was perfect, but he is always playing the same role as a quirky, nervous type of guy. Charlie Day, on the other hand, was the best dude of the three guys, because with all of his energy and quirkiness, he can be able to do such funny things by just acting completely weird. THE BOSSES: Kevin Spacey once again does brilliant work on the screen since ""American Beauty"", and took on a role that brought a lot of enthusiasm and wackiness. Colin Farrell does a killer performance, but he should have got more screen time. But Jennifer Aniston completely stole the show, because she was portraying such a role that she has never done before, and she really delivers! Let's just say her role is ""sexually surprising"". Oh, and Jamie Foxx was pretty funny in the movie as Mother-(fill in the blanks) Jones! That's it! From a cool soundtrack, a hilarious script, to a brilliant cast ensemble, ""Horrible Bosses"" delivers all the laughs you want, and they never stop entertaining you with so much raunchy humor. ""Horrible Bosses"", in my review, ""laugh-out-loud hilarious, enjoyable from start to finish"".",Horrible Bosses
127,Rockwell_Cronenberg,The funniest movie in a long time.,6,22 September 2011,"Simply put, one of the most hilarious films I've ever seen. I never laugh out loud when I'm watching something by myself, but I did it at least a dozen times during this. There were times where I couldn't breathe I was laughing so hard. I was expecting the film to go to some dark places, but it was way more black and wild than I was anticipating it to be. There were moments that just had me screaming in stunned laughter. What really sold the film were the three leads. Jason Bateman, Charlie Day and Jason Sudeikis are three actors that I have immensely enjoyed for years in their own contexts, but bringing them all together was such a brilliant idea. The film is at it's peak when they are all on screen together and the most surprising thing is that no one upstages anyone else. The three of them work together as this cohesive unit, nobody stealing the show.Colin Farrell is the only one of the bosses that I loved and I wish he was given more screen time (his scene in the credits had me crying), but Kevin Spacey and Jennifer Aniston certainly weren't bad. Another huge surprise was how fresh it felt all the way through. Pretty much every by-the-books comedy like this feels the need to throw in this dramatic ""everyone learns a lesson"" third act in the end that always disrupts the flow and just makes the film drag on, but this one didn't do that at all. It ended with a hilarious high and never once dragged for a second. I don't think I've ever felt that a comedy like this was too short, but at the end of this one I seriously just wanted it to go on longer; that's never happened with me. It was too good, even better than I was hoping and I can't wait to watch it again.",Horrible Bosses
128,asb_deutsch,A good one time watch,7,11 November 2015,"Kudos to the ""killer cast""- Aniston and Spacey sizzle as crude bosses. The cast is quite good, Kevin Spacey shines in the role of one the bosses and as does Jennifer Aniston. Jamie Foxx and Colin Farrell also worth a mention are the most funniest of them all. The lead- trio share a nice chemistry and even if unoriginal they fill in the shoes just fine. Colin Farell of course, devilish indeed! 😈 HB is still funny though, and with a neat running time it's a story you can get invested in without having to pay too much attention. Many of the jokes are funny and a scene involving an assassin who turns out not to be an assassin is very funny. Though it should be funnier than it is 😂",Horrible Bosses
129,Meven_Stoffat,"Nothing ""horrible"" here",10,11 July 2011,"Admit it. You have, or at least have had, a boss that you wish would just frack off and die. As Jason Bateman's character correctly puts in the beginning of the film, ""the way you become successful is taking sh-t"". Well in Horrible Bosses, three lovable average ordinary men have taken too much sh-t, and have decided it's time for them to put some action in their lives. The results are only hilarious, and dark and twisty, making for a fun and hilarious dark comedy! I'll admit when I saw the trailer, I just thought this was a comedy about a bunch of people that hate their bosses, making it a passable black comedy at best. But imagine my surprise when the movie's twists came!First off, this is a smart black comedy. If you are expecting Observe And Report, which was another brilliant black comedy, you will be disappointed. This is very different.the first half of the film is where all the big laughs that you'd get in an Apatow production came. And there are plenty of laughs. The film manages to stay light and funny, even during the part where they conspire to kill their bosses and hire Motherf-cker Jones, played brilliantly by Jamie Foxx.And then the second half comes, and with just one scene, the movie takes a very dark turn. I was completely gob smacked. The film still manages to be funny, all while toying with your expectations. There is lots of black comedy in the second half, and boy does it work out well. Believe me, this is a fantastic movie. I dunno if I would say I'd place it on par with Bridesmaids, but it certainly better than that Hangover II garbage. The script is clever and twisty, and the humour is spot on, like any brilliantly written comedy. Whet makes this great is that for once it was actually WRITTEN, and it shows. Not like garbage like this year's abortion named Your Highness, where a large chunk was improvised. And for that, the movie works and is funny from beginning to end.Another great feature is the performances. One would expect with a cast like Kevin Spacey, Colin Farrell and Chris Day, for great performances. Foxx steals the show, in my opinion, but Spacey and Aniston were great too! Honestly, all involved were great. Bateman is charmingly brilliant too, as is Sudekis. And the ending, well let's just say it was one of the best I've seen in a long time!In short, this is one of the best movies of the year, and maybe the second best comedy of the year. Especially with all that garage like Pirates 4 and Super 8, this is one movie you cannot miss!Overall:10/10Pros: This film is consistently funny, dark, unexpected and overall will provide a great time for those willing to have their expectations completely defied!Cons: Tise expecting Apatow or a movie like Your Highness will be disappointed.",Horrible Bosses
130,dommercaldi,Fun Little Comedy To Pass Away The Time,7,14 April 2020,"Pros:
1. The comedy is laugh-out-loud hilarious and almost never fails to procure a laugh.
2. Jason Bateman (Nick Hendricks), Charlie Day (Dale Arbus), and Jason Sudeikis (Kurt Buckman) have terrific chemistry together.
3. Jason Sudeikis, Charlie Day, and Jason Bateman deliver great comedic performances. Colin Farrell (Bobby Pellit), Kevin Spacey (Dave Harken), and Jennifer Aniston (Dr. Julia Harris) do a great job at appearing evil and you genuinely detest their characters.
4. The soundtrack does a really good job at adding a fun bounce to the movie.
5. The pacing is not too slow or fast, thus helping to keep your attention until the end.
6. All of the bosses, for the most part, receive an extremely satisfying comeuppance.Cons:
1. A couple of the jokes fall a little flat.
2. The exposing of Dave Harken to the police via Atmanand (Brian George) informing the police of his sound recording functions is a little bizarre. There is no AI software that is that well-developed.",Horrible Bosses
131,Ryan_MYeah,Witty for what it is. Just don't expect a comedy of total hysteria.,6,20 December 2011,"I'm just gonna be blunt... I was not crazy about this movie. I'm sorry, but I honestly was expecting to enjoy it more, especially since I had heard so many funny things about it. Maybe it was aimed at those with something of an acquired taste, because the movie has a very specific, very twisted sense of humor that goes down some pretty dark roads. I mean, this review is coming from someone who laughs harder at the Monty Python show and movies than anything.At least the cast is pretty admirable stuff. They each get their own unique moments of hilarity, with Charlie Day and Colin Farrell standing out in a field of such talented comics. When the movie is funny, it's hysterically so (Day has one particular scene with Kevin Spacey, whose character has a peanut allergy, that had me rolling). I just felt like the comedy was a bit on the uneven side. A lot of outrageous things happen, but I'm not laughing that much.Still, I can't be too harsh on something that was actually not half bad, so I'll recommend it for a rental.**1/2 out of ****",Horrible Bosses
132,D_Burke,"Everyone's Had A Bad Boss, & Everyone's Had That Fantasy",8,17 July 2011,"For us moviegoers who have had at least some real world experience, and have had ""one of those jobs"" with ""one of those bosses"", ""Horrible Bosses"" comes as a huge breath of fresh air. Regardless of whether it's a good job or not, there are some, perhaps many, executives who leave a trail of blood on their way to the top, and don't even have the courtesy to clean it up. It doesn't matter who you are or what you do. These bosses are just assholes or bullies.As I watched this movie, I couldn't help but think of a horrible boss that I had. I was working in a grocery store in college, and one of my assistant managers made Ebenezer Scrooge look like Lee Iaccoca. I worked hard every day I was there, but if I did one thing wrong, he would get right in my face and speak harsh words through gritted teeth. I always wished he would get himself caught in the box crusher out back, while I ""accidentally"" pulled the switch. If that actually happened, I would be writing this review from jail. Still, though, for disgruntled workers like me, ""Horrible Bosses"" struck very familiar tones.Jason Bateman (""Hancock"" (2008), ""Up In The Air"" (2009)), Jason Sudeikis (TV's ""Saturday Night Live""), and Charlie Day (TV's ""It's Always Sunny In Philadelphia"") do great jobs portraying hard-working professionals whose bosses stand in the way of advancements in their jobs and lives. Of course, their performances would not have been great without the actors playing those bosses.It's no surprise seeing Kevin Spacey as a corrupt, micromanaging hothead at the financial firm where Nick Hendricks (Bateman) works. He played the same kind of character in ""Swimming With Sharks"" (1994), and he does well playing someone who is mean and intense. He also doesn't miss a beat when he awards a coveted position to himself. Other actors may have winked and nodded to the camera at that point, but Spacey never has to.The other horrible bosses are brilliantly over the top. Bobby Pellitt (Colin Farrell) is a coked-up slacker of an employee at Pellitt Chemicals who is hired only because of his father, founder Jack Pellitt (Donald Sutherland). Although Kurt Buckman (Sudeikis) is second in command, Bobby becomes CEO, and Kurt's boss, after Jack suddenly dies. While Jack was like a father to Kurt, Bobby is the worst boss ever.Anyone who has seen a preview for the film knows that Kevin Spacey and Colin Farrell could easily be bad bosses, but Jennifer Aniston? A bad boss to a guy? Well, dental assistant Dale Arbus (Day), who is engaged, is a lot more professional than his boss, Dr. Julia Harris, who is a nymphomaniac that takes pride in sexually harassing Dale every chance she gets. To guys, this boss may be a dream come true, as Kurt, who has a way with the ladies, surmises many times in the movie.It's refreshing to see Aniston in a comedy role that doesn't require her to be the distraught girlfriend or the whiny single woman, which are roles that have practically defined her acting career after ""Friends"". Here, she's funny because she says the most outrageous things to Dale, and her come-ons to him effectively bring the awkward and uncomfortable. And yes, this is coming from a heterosexual man who had a crush on Rachel in the 90's.So why do these three friends not quit their jobs? Well, it's 2011, and the economy still sucks. That point makes sense to me and anyone else who has turned on the news lately. So they decide to hire a hit-man, although have no clue as to how they do that. Their attempts to find one on Craig's List and through an OnStar-like representative are pretty funny.Eventually, they go to the bad part of the city and happen upon former convict Dean Jones (Jamie Foxx in his first funny role in years), who goes by a nickname that I can't print on IMDb. Rather than Mr. Jones whacking these bosses, he suggests each of them whack one of the bosses that's not his own. Oh yeah, they have to make it look like accidents too.From there, the three friends break into their bad bosses' houses in desperate measures to off their bosses. It's funny how they go about doing these things without even the slightest idea how to create a perfect murder. If I described each part and why it was funny, it would completely take away the magic of this film. Plus, there are some great plot twists that effortlessly weave their way into this story, and even result in some shocking turning points here and there.Other comedies of similar nature would have the main characters be too nice, and ultimately decide in the end that killing is not the answer. Here, the story comes close to that conclusion, but fortunately doesn't succumb to that temptation. What results is a hilarious comedy that doubles as a revenge fantasy, and most of the plot elements fit together perfectly. There is also a surprising cameo at the end, who fortunately is also funny.Of course, many people are already comparing this movie to ""The Hangover"" (2009) and, for that matter, ""The Hangover II"" (2011). To those people I simply say: stop! Not every comedy that has three or more guys working together is automatically a ripoff of ""The Hangover"", nor is this movie trying to be ""The Hangover"". The guys in ""The Hangover"" didn't have a plan, whereas the guys in ""Horrible Bosses"" do. Their plans inevitably go awry, but that's why it's funny. Take a deep breath, remind yourself that's it's mostly original, and enjoy the film.",Horrible Bosses

I love films like these; starting with The Hangover. They bring dark humor with lots of entertainment. And that is all I expected. The cast is a great lineup. They aren't too famous and they aren't too big. This is what the Hangover did, and I love it. The movie starts with regular people with regular hatred towards their bosses. Simplistic and sweet, it's automatically awesome. Then all of them have the plan to kill them, and this is where the fun starts... I loved everybody's performance ESPECIALLY Jennifer's. You never see her playing this type of role, it was new and exciting; I never would've expected it. Everybody else was great too, especially the bosses. When they get caught up in their bosses dirty business, your in for more fun. It reminds me of the formula from stoner flicks like Pineapple Express or some others. It was all innocent and sweet until it moves along more. The humor was spot on; everybody's performance and every line delivered was gold. I must point out the interrogation scene or the gang in the house. More of, I loved the whole movie. I thought it was something new for everybody; but still keeping the same sort of power older ones have. You can instantly get caught up in their hilarious situations and join along the fun. Everything was spot on and everything was formulaic for summer fun. If your expecting what I expected, you found the right movie. If your expecting another comedy, you found the right movie. If you expected a new selection is comedy classics, you possibly have came across the right movie. Highly recommendable, highly see able, highly hilarious. 8/10.",Horrible Bosses
135,mistoppi,"Average dark comedy, not necessarily worth seeing",4,21 January 2017,"I didn't exactly know the plot when I started watching, I just knew the name and didn't make big assumptions based on it. The biggest reason for me to watch this movie is the incredibly talented cast. I'm especially fond of Charlie Day, Jennifer Aniston, Colin Darrel, Kevin Spacey and Jamie Foxx. The casting is great, everyone's character is exactly right for them, and especially when it comes to comedians and their style of acting in comedic roles.The plot is funny and it's actually so weird how thrilling this movie ended up being. But as to whether or not it's unpredictable... it's a comedy, so typically the writers have chosen always to go into the funniest way possible. Well, as funny as they can imagine. Sometimes it's predictable, sometimes it's not. What you can predict that in comedies everyone is very very dumb even when they are accidentally brilliant. Everything is going wrong until the last possible moment perhaps. So vis-à-vis the plot and the humour, Horrible Bosses is just pretty average typical dark comedy, apart from having somewhat atypical plot. And by somewhat atypical I mean it has definitely been done before, but it's not repeating some movie that already exists, and the same kind of thing isn't being done every year - apart from sequels. What bothered me the most was the annoying way the characters reacted to their friend (played by Charlie Day) being sexually assaulted by his female boss. ""Your situation isn't so bad"", ""I can't really take you seriously right now"", like are you f#@4ing kidding me? Apparently it's rare to see men writing comedy and not being really awfully sexist, like can people stop with the idea that men would enjoy being sexually assaulted / raped? So all in all, pretty average for its genre and humour. ... Wow that seems really dark after the last paragraph but that's how it is, I guess.

136,rparham,"Funny, falling a bit short of hilarity",7,29 July 2011,"You have to wonder these days if Hollywood has any ability to make more than two kinds of comedy films. The first is the supremely juvenile kid film, targeted so blatantly at children that parent's groan at the thought of their little ones wanting to go to the movies. The second category, arguably born with There's Something About Mary, is what I call the ""Shock Comedy"", films that try to push the boundaries of good taste and civility to its breaking point. Horrible Bosses definitely falls into the latter category, but proves to be an entertaining, if somewhat underwhelming, example of the genre. It isn't quite as lewd as other films of its style, and manages to deliver a decent number of laughs, but I doubt anyone will be singing its praises a few years from now.Horrible Bosses rides on the casting of its three titular bosses: Dave (Kevin Spacey), whose seemingly whole purpose in life is to make Nick's (Jason Bateman) life a complete living hell, forcing him to work long hours and endure psychological torture with the promise of a promotion at the end of the tunnel. Bobby (Colin Farrell) is the coke-addled son of Kurt's (Jason Sudeikis) beloved long-time employer (Donald Sutherland) who takes over the company after the elder dies of a heart attack and is exclusively interested in riding the white horse, partying with strippers, and siphoning off as much profit from the business as possible to make his dream life of endless partying possible. Finally, there is Julia (Jennifer Aniston), the dentist who employs Dale (Charlie Day), but also has her eye on using Dale as her own personal sex toy, constantly taunting him with potential faked blackmail she will use against his fiancé if he doesn't do the horizontal tango with Julia prior to his wedding day.Nick, Kurt and Dale have decided their individual situations are no longer tolerable, and have decided to take matters into their own hands: they decide that the world will be better off without their bosses in it. Not initially interested in getting their hands dirty, the trio stumble upon a ""murder consultant"", in the guise of one Mr. Jones (Jamie Foxx), first name not to be featured in a mixed company forum. He suggests that they off each other's superior, a la Strangers on a Train or Throw Momma From the Train (depending on your film knowledge). The group starts out with reconnaissance, then eventually things get unexpectedly out of control, leading to some sticky situations for the friends.With the potential of Spacey, Farrell and Aniston selling the premise, and its murder driven plot, Horrible Bosses has the potential for a black comedy, but only vaguely dips its toes in the pool of the that genre. Instead, it only briefly touches on the depth of the darkness possible, but mostly keeps the overall situation light, well, as light as an R-rated comedy can get. Some of this is helped by the likability of the protagonists. Nick, Kurt and Dave, as portrayed by Bateman, Sudeikis and Day, are relatively nice guys, stuck in bad situations, and only turning to their particular resolution out of a sense of desperation. Even Jones has an air of frivolity to him, despite the prominent head tattoos and off-putting first name. Horrible Bosses takes a peak behind the black comedy curtain, but never steps into the darkness.It does manage to wade a bit into the pool of the Shock Comedy, featuring such scenes as an initial meeting by the friends with a guy hired off the internet who is a specialist in ""wetwork"" (you have to see the film to figure out what it means), a visit to his bosses bathroom by Kurt that ends a bit gross, and Aniston's Julia, who isn't afraid to push the boundaries of all her previous work far beyond what you expect of her. There are plenty of laughs to be had by the misadventures in the film, to be sure, although Horrible Bosses never quite crosses the line into hilarity. The film is funny to be sure, but it is never riotous, falling short of a great comedy that will tickle the funny bone for years to come.Spacey is at his mocking, depraved best as Dave, the boss who isn't afraid to let everyone else suffer while he makes his own life better. Spacey plays this kind of role well, and fits the character to a tee. Farrell shows promise as Bobby, but of the three, he is the most underutilized by the film. Some blooper materials in the credits suggest that there were more scenes with Bobby planned that got cut, which is too bad, as he provides some nice laughs in his limited scenes. But Aniston is arguably the standout, operating outside the type of role she has taken before, and giving Julia a mix of sexy and mean that is very effective. She turns into the boss you love to hate in this film. The friends are all well filled out by Bateman, Sudeikis and Day. Bateman, having seen a significant career upswing since Arrested Development, has been mastering the role of put-upon working stiff for several years, and gives his dependable best here. Sudeikis is the horn dog of the group, but still manages to have a degree of niceness to him. Day is the weird one, albeit not so weird to be off-putting. Of the three ""straight men"", he delivers the most laughs. Finally, Foxx manages to put on a good show of parody and in-jokiness as Jones, making the most of his small part.Horrible Bosses is a decent comedy that has a sufficient number of laughs to make you leave the theater feeling entertained, but doesn't quite get let off the leash to soar higher. There are more than a few standout scenes, but manages to be just a good, not great, comedy.",Horrible Bosses
137,robsta23,It Was Hilarious the First Time...,7,12 February 2015,"I'm doing a double review today of this and Horrible Bosses 2, which is playing at my dorm building's theater tonight, and I have to say I'm somewhat disappointed with this film after I have seen it so much. Noticing this film has little comedy that is actually clever or invested in character rather than just random jokes, this film merely passes as an entertaining, easy watch to me now. At its best, this film takes good philosophy from Strangers on a Train as well as Crime and Punishment and grounds it in a story that many can relate to - hating their bosses. It is also a meta-film at points, aware of and referencing other films in pop culture, even making fun of crime movies with how little money is actually in the briefcase given to Mother F***er Jones ($5000 IS a small amount of money to pay for a crime - sorry, murder consultation). The comedy of the movie is primarily driven through the characters of Dave Harken (Bateman's boss played by Kevin Spacey) and reactions/mistakes/quirkiness coming from Dale (Charlie Day's character). In 2011 my thoughts were that if Robert Downey Jr. can be nominated for an Oscar for his role in Tropic Thunder, why cannot Kevin Spacey be nominated for his great mannerisms in this comedy? Spacey is clearly the strongest actor in this movie, which is a disappointment with him getting little screen time as one of the bosses who need to go. Like most comedies this seems to be more of the ""lightly edited improv"" we get instead of smarter comedies such as the recent film The World's End, which actually use visual comedy. Cinematically, the only aspects of this film I found interesting were a good time lapse that happens around Nick at the beginning of the film and the feel of a camcorder when Jones is using one at the end of the film. To enjoy it, I guess do not watch it as many times as I have and you might get some good laughs from it.",Horrible Bosses

Perhaps I am just asking too much but if I just read some parts of the script to myself I can make it sound funny whereas in the film it seems to fall flat.Jennifer Anniston is a revelation, Kevin Spacey is bloody brilliant, Charlie Day is excellent, Jamie Foxx is part perfect and Colin Farrell camps it up like the best. The rest are chiefly okay but, in parts, do the sliding I referred to earlier. The script is better than the movie, a work of art, and with several laugh out loud moments.The premise is probably central to all our lives - what to do with the boss from hell - but is compounded by the characters themselves since they are just not good enough to be horrible bosses if you understand my meaning. But they do kid themselves they are up to the task of relieving themselves of their nemesis and this is when the film begins to go where the comedy can come thick and fast.This is not a must see film but it is a good comedy.

139,loco_73,I wish my dentist looked like Jennifer Aniston!,8,18 July 2011,"Let's be honest a lot of men would at that...and also let's be honest about the fact that at one point in time we have all worked for or at least encountered in the workplace the ""horrible bosses"" of this movie's name sake. Case-in-point, myself...12 years in my job and invariably I have seen some form or incarnation of the portraits painted of the bosses, supervisors and co-workers in this hilarious comedy! ""Horrible Bosses"" evokes a lot of the same feelings I had when I watched the now comedy classic ""Office Space"" and its more subdued but still good companion ""Extract"". I mean this as a compliment. It just killed me at how accurate a view of the people which populate an office or any other work setting, those movies captured. ""Horrible Bosses"" easily accomplishes that same threshold.Sure, the nastiness of the antagonists is exaggerated and inflated, but the kernel of truth upon which it is based is unmistakable! The cast is remarkable Jason Bateman and Jason Sudeikis are solid, but to me Charlie Day reserves the biggest portion of the laughs! He feels really oppressed and abused, a feeling that is amplified by his companions' outright dismissal of his plight at the hands of the nutty and crazy Julia, his boss (and one of the sexiest dentists I have ever seen...). He is a man that has been constantly walked over, mistreated and seen as a weakling and push-over, especially as he says because his goal in life has always been to ""be a husband"".The movie's quality would have been seriously hampered had the supporting cast been any less. Just seeing Colin Farrell's visage in front of my eyes solicits laughs, his entire appearance and demeanour is prime rate, and one can tell that he had a lot of fun with his character. Kevin Spacey, well he is Kevin Spacey, always top-notch, and here thankfully channelling some of the maniacal streak he displayed in ""Swimming With The Sharks"" another seminal take on workplace torture and enslavement...LOL! Jennifer Aniston in this movie, is the Jennifer Aniston I would like to see more of in other movies. She is ballsy, crazy, demanding, weird, nasty, explicit and really, really horny, which makes for a hilarious character! Instead of doing all the mindless and pointless romantic comedies she has made recently, she should perhaps focus more on these off-kilter roles, because they suit her, again I don't mean this as an insult! Her turn in ""Horrible Bosses"" was as good or perhaps better than Cameron Diaz's as the pot-smoking, sex-crazed, foul-mouthed teacher in ""Bad Teacher"".All in all a good comedy to go along with ""Bad Teacher"" and ""Bridesmaids, and an over-all relief from the drone-like-assembly-line feel of the Summer box office.",Horrible Bosses

143,axlrhodes,"Same tone as The Hangover, funny though.",7,11 September 2012,"Ever since 'The Hangover' stormed the box office a few years ago, the stock of the screwball adult comedy has risen significantly. If there's any film that in terms of tone Horrible Bosses could be compared to, then it's most definitely Todd Phillips' tale of drunken memory lapse in Las Vegas. How you feel about that film might determine whether your'e going to get much further than this sentence, for the characters and situations in Horrible Bosses are every bit as ridiculous as their hungover cousins. What this film has in it's favour however is three star studded horrible bosses all given full licence to indulge their inner over-actor. Kevin Spacey gleefully turns on the manipulation as Jason Bateman's nasty boss, Jennifer Aniston revels in sexing things up as Charlie Day's nymphomaniac dentist boss while Colin Farrell rounds things off a sleazy Tony 'Scarface' Montana wannabe and boss to Jason Sudeikis. All three bring a huge amount of enjoyment while clearly relishing the opportunity to let rip. As was the case in The Hangover, the further things progress, the more outrageous they become but it's clear from early on that this is the tone and despite the madcap antics, there are laughs aplenty. This isn't a film that people are going to be talking about for weeks afterwards, you might forget it and see it again on TV again in a few years only to remember that you found parts of it funny, but while it's on, it's perfectly good fun. While not as smart or incisive as say 'Office Space', it isn't without merit and will work well for anyone after indulging a spot of brainless knockabout comedy.",Horrible Bosses
144,Fields201,Almost Like The Hangover Without The Hangover,7,10 July 2011,"I only found out about Horrible Bosses just recently and decided to give it a watch this weekend. I needed a good laugh after the week I had. I must say that I laughed, but not hysterically or anything.The film centers around three guys: Nick, Dale and Kurt; who hate their bosses and wants them dead. This sounds like a premise for a psychological thriller but it's actually a comedy... an adolescent comedy but a comedy. One boss played by Kevin Spacey (the best part of the movie) is such a jerk, that he's more of a bully than a boss. He also suspects his young hot wife of cheating on him, and this could be part of why he's so angry all the time. The other boss, played by Jennifer Aniston, wants to seduce Dale who is trying to be faithful to his fiancé. Then there's Donald Sutherland.... who isn't a jerk but he dies and the company is left to his cokehead son (Colin Farrell) who just wants to sabotage the company for his own personal gain.Part of the comedy is how they try to kill their bosses which is all part of the comedy. It has a nice few twist and turns in the story, and honestly I wasn't sure how it would all end. Another great addition to the film is Jamie Foxx who acts as their murder consultant. He looked like he was having a lot of fun with the role, and it was fun to watch him.Horrible Bosses is a funny film, but I didn't think it was a hilarious film. It's enough to go see it, but I doubt it would reach The Hangover standards with people so don't expect a sequel. The best part of this movie is that they refrained from using Ken Jeong, who is getting typecast lately. Kevin Spacey is worth seeing this film alone. For that I recommend it.",Horrible Bosses

What is wrong with you people, have you lost your judgment capacities entirely?! What have you been watching lately to unbelievably consider this movie something watchable, entertaining or whatever?It has an interesting plot but a horrible script, actors playing annoying characters and a very, very awful development. Never found Jennifer Aniston funnier or interesting more than what she did in Friends, but here she exceeds the line of what an actor should never ever do. I think the same about Jason Bateman, he's not funny and I never could understand why Americans love him so much. The only actors who save some minutes are Kevin Spacey and Collin Farrell. Both Kevin and Collin seems to just having some fun and never try hard to give very funny moments that the other ones never give.Awful, unfunny, uncomfortable, a waste of time and money.

Jason Bateman, Charlie Day, Jennifer Aniston, Kevin Spacey, Jason Sudeikis, and Collin Farrell all do a great job at portraying their respective characters. Jennifer Aniston's character is probably the best only because Jennifer is so freaking hot. The story is fast paced and is very funny with well timed jokes and some over the top humor. The runtime is a little bit lengthy and the ending is kinda cliché.Pros: Great acting, fast pace, well timed humor, and Jennifer Aniston's hot bodyCons : Overlong runtime and a cliché endingOverall Rating: 7.3P.S.

147,troy-manatunga,Maybe fall short of 10 spine cracking laughs but clearly and firmly will stand at number 2 for a long time!,7,9 July 2011,"****Sigh**** In a more than dry summer release at Hollywood, amidst the vast number of summer failures only a handful, literally only a handful of movies of 2011 summer will remain with us as entertainment for the masses. Clearly almost on Par with Todd Phillips is Seth Gordon in his progressive directorial ""Horrible Bosses"". Nick, Charlie & Kurt ; 3 young men pursuing the real American dream of making a life and leaving behind a legacy for their next generation unfortunately has 3 of the worst possible bosses anyone of us of could dream of. A psycho, A man-eater & a tool in the order of Harken, Dr. Julia & Bobby Pellit. Working for these 3 monsters becomes extremely frustrating and in a drunken state Nick, Charlie & Kurt suggests that killing them would be the only way out of misery. Although they completely treat it as a conversation one would have after a few beers, certain incidents leads them to take it to the next level. The 3 adamant men with the assistance of Gregory (The Navigation system of the VW Kurt drives) set out in search of the meanest bar in the most dangerous part of the city to find a Hit-man! Jason Bateman, Jason Sudeikis & Charlie Day, this is the WOLF PACK in this side of town I would say. I am not quite sure how they do it, but they work with each other brilliantly. Bateman who is calm in his (Just as in Arrested Development) Sudeikis with his Alpha male ego & Day in his hyperactive state compliments each other stunningly well. Jamie Foxx clears it over the ropes as the hit man from the dark alleys of town ;)  Kevin Spacey in his aura of vanity, Jennifer Aniston who can still pull off the sexy dentist with a performance that surpasses ""Just Go with It"" from earlier this year & Colin Farrell as the crack head boss who is fantastic in his support role. My personal overall favorite was Charlie Day, all you readers watch out for this guy, he is pure concentrated laughter with a touch of Steve Carell in his style if I may so without offending Charlie day in any way for his talent. A great movie is a collaboration of the cast & crew. A director with a vision a writer with the passion and the cast with talent! Every now & then we see these traits together in certain productions, I have personally seen such this summer as I am certain you readers too have. Director Seth Gordon who surprised me with ""Horrible Bosses"" in making it such a successful comedy has spent more time on TV screens than the wide silver screens of Hollywood. Bringing his experience and sharing his talent and lifting his career through to the next level of directing through this production is wise. So here I have my director with a vision. Now for my writer with a passion Michael Markowitz whose brain child ""Horrible Bosses"" is, very smart and unique school of thought from all those that we see today. As for the cast with talent you have already met them!VerdictA tough one; the easiest way to pass judgment on this would be to benchmark it with the worldwide hit ""The Hangover"". Maybe fall short of 10 spine cracking laughs but clearly and firmly will stand at number 2 for a long time!Title: Horrible Bosses Directed by: Seth Gordon Starring: Jason Bateman, Jason Sudeikis, Charlie Day, Jamie Foxx, Kevin Spacey, Colin Farrell & Jennifer Aniston Rated: R for crude and sexual content, pervasive language and some drug material Rating: 7.5/10 100 Minutes",Horrible Bosses
148,Bravesfan17,A funny movie that goes into darker grounds,9,8 July 2011,"Nick, Dale, and Kurt are all best friends and have jobs that are not the greatest in the film. In the beginning of the film we are introduced to each of our leading characters and what they go through on a daily basis from their bosses. Nick, played by Jason Bateman, has to follow extreme rules set by his boss Dave Harken, played by Kevin Spacey. In order to get a promotion that he wants, Nick has to do things he doesn't want to do but has to because it's Harken's orders.Next, we are introduced to Dale, played by Charlie Day. Dale is a dentist's assistant. His horrible boss is Dr. Julia Harris, played hilariously by Jennifer Aniston. Julia is a sex fiend who is always hitting on Dale, even though he is engaged to another woman. Dale must play by Julia's rules so that he doesn't lose his relationship with his fiancé or his job. Dale also won't be able to get another job because he is a registered sex offender.Then along comes Kurt, played by Jason Sudeikis. At first, Kurt is happy with his job at a chemical company owned by Jack Pellit, played in a brief role by Donald Sutherland. Not too long in, Jack gets into a car crash and has a heart attack. The company is taken over by Jack's son Bobby, played by Colin Farrell. Bobby is a coke addict and total prick who orders Kurt to fire some employees.All three know that they do not like the fact that they have to deal with their bosses, but feel they have no options but to suck it up. One night while they are drunk, they come up with the idea of killing their bosses. They then hire a guy named Jones, played by Jamie Foxx, to be their consultant on how to kill them. Jones gives them the idea of killing each other's bosses.The story goes into many dark grounds with the idea of killing their bosses, and the story manages to stay funny, thanks to the efforts of director Seth Gordon. Gordon found the ability to keep the humor intact to each scene and keeps the film hilarious and interesting throughout. Gordon also does some great work at making the situations really dark but also shining some light on it.The acting is really good. Bateman, Day, and Sudeikis make a hilarious trio and have great chemistry together. Spacey, Aniston, and Farrell are all hilarious as the title characters, and each have their great moments. Foxx also has a couple of great moments as Jones.",Horrible Bosses

150,Kubris,A fun and silly comedy,6,27 July 2011,"Horrible Bosses is a fun movie with some interesting characters and many, many crude jokes. In that regard, it's a regular comedy. Come, laugh, forget about it.The story of Horrible Bosses is about 3 dudes who want to deal with their bosses. They decide to try and kill their bosses. The first part of the film, which shows their predicaments, is funny and can be hilarious. But after meeting MF Jones, the jokes aren't as funny and the film just isn't as good. This isn't a story-based movie.Jokes. Crude, sexual, plentiful. Horribles Bosses is surprisingly vulgar. If you like Jennifer Aniston saying 'p***y*' you'll have a great time. I didn't find it too funny. The wit is lacking.Two characters are great: Kevin Spacey as the boss and MF Jones. Spacey's monster is evil, and it's hilarious. He's just an awesome actor that can play all kinds of roles.The other is MF Jones, played by a badass looking Jamie Foxx. He reminds me of Jules Winnfield, a cinematic icon. His name explanation is too funny.One character that isn't great is Charlie Day's. He's copy-pasted from the Hangover, including the beard and adding a brutally annoying voice. He's a chore to hear.You'll probably laugh at Horrible Bosses, because you're a more lenient comedy critic.

If it wasn't for her tremendous comic timing I would have fallen asleep plenty of times throughout Horrible Bosses, it's great to see her playing against character.The rest of the movie is pretty mindless, the 3 male leads are flat, the gags are cheap, the ending is so far fetched I felt insulted the filmmakers expected us to fall for it, with each new movie I see Jason Sudekeis in I dislike him mote and more.I think in a better directors hands this movie could have been great, also replace the 3 leads and it may have been a tad better. There's not much else I can really say, it's just so disappointing. I do hope Jennifer Aniston dies more roles like this though, she shines.Thoroughly disappointing.",Horrible Bosses
152,julian-mumford,A middling comedy with a lackluster script,5,15 February 2012,"Some of us have bosses we don't get on with, it goes with the territory, sometimes it's hard to like the people who tell you what to do.Nick (Jason Bateman) hates his boss Dave Harken (Spacey), who criticizes him for being two minutes late and accuses him of a drink problem, after he has plied him with Scotch at 8:00am.Newly engaged Dale (Day) hates his hot boss Dr Harris (Aniston), as her dental assistant he sits close to her all day providing Harris every opportunity for constant unwanted sexual harassment.Finally, we have Kurt (Buck) who loved his job until his benevolent employer (Sutherland) drops dead leaving his coke addled loser son in charge, an unrecognizable Colin Farrell.Instead of sucking it up, the trio decide over beers at a bar, that enough is enough, the bosses life expectancy needs to be de-emphasized. Not possessing the necessary homicidal skills they employ a ""murder consultant"" (Jamie Foxx), to complete their dirty work for them and get their bosses ""whacked"".The premise is good and we have some significant talent on display, so does this comedy have what it takes to kill you? A comedy needs laughs and we do get some chuckles but the tone is very uneven and none of the characters are believable or acts in the manner you might expect. The ""A"" list cameos add some spice but largely the opportunities for real belly laughs due to the farcical situations in which the trio find themselves, are criminally wasted.Dale is designated as a ""Child sex offender"", albeit somewhat falsely accused, this sloppy plot device ensures he cannot leave his employment. Why not just place him in a job where he cannot use his skills elsewhere, rather than this bizarre trait, which will instantly turn audiences off.There are some funny lines, including why drag racing in a Prius is a bad idea and why it is difficult to put cocaine back in a box. The trio do their best with a weak script and improbable situations but on occasion their commitment is lacking and there is a feeling of ""phoning it in"".With a box office take of over $200 million this is yet another example of a very weak ""comedy"" performing well at the box office. Expect more movies with modest budgets, great trailers and yet disappointing films at a multiplex near you soon.Summary Despite an interesting set up and major talent available, this is disappointing and lacks real laughs to pull the story through.A middling comedy with a lackluster script, you can certainly do better for your comedy dollar.http://julesmoviereviews.blogspot.co.nz/",Horrible Bosses

I tried my best to remain interested but it is soooo slow. Then all the way through it constantly misses the comedy timing. When I say misses, I mean HUGE miss.

Before my review gets pulled for ""abuse"",heres the basic premise. In a nutshell, some office workers deceide to murder their bosses cuz they feel that their lives would be a lot better with them gone, then when things take a wrong turn, the desperation of the workers-and the screenwriter begin to show. ""Borrowing"" elements of some of Hitchcocks best work, the story quickly fizzles out as film takes the shortcut to predictability and mediocrity. . Cast is only so-so, but Kevin Spacey seems to be chanelling his ""American Beauty"" role. Bateman and others are quite forgettable and Jennifer Aniston-possibly the worst non actress of this decade goes against type and plays a slutty skanky role that the director hoped would give this film some ""balls"", but all she seems to do is alienate and repel the audience even further. The only way I could recommend this movie to you is to try to sneak into it at some multiplex and wait until the film you really want to see starts, that is, of course if you can find one that is actually worth seeing. If you remember the early 80s ""Nine to Five"" that movie pretty much had the same premise as this with some funny fantasy sequences too. I'll leave you, dear readers to deceide which is the better one-think Dolly Parton. Thank God that I get to see these movies for free.

He tells a ridiculous story about how he got that name. As they then try to execute their plans, we get their goofy stuff which forms most of the gag.The story feels a bit forced though. The first half comparatively was much better and hilarious. The humor in the relations between the 3 of them and their bosses is well executed. The cast is quite good, Kevin Spacey shines in the role of one the bosses and as does Jennifer Aniston. Jamie Foxx and Colin Farrell also worth a mention are the most funniest of them all. The lead- trio share a nice chemistry and even if unoriginal they fill in the shoes just fine. There are many hilarious scenes, my favorite one is when when Dale is left outside in car while other 2 are in Nick's boss's house. The humor is mix of dark and goofy which makes it enjoyable in much wider band and good acting backs it up nicely. Entertainingly funny and worth a shot.RATING: [3/5]",Horrible Bosses

He dreams of a big promotion, which he clearly deserves. Dale is committed to the woman he loves. His plan is to marry her, sustaining their relationship through his earnings as a dentist's assistant. Kurt is content with his role in the chemical company he's in. He smiles in the thought that he could one day be in charge. Nick, Dale and Kurt are such harmless, typical fellas that, when they agree that it would be best to kill their bosses, we wonder how evil their superiors could be.The bosses in ""Horrible Bosses"" are indeed what the title suggests them to be, and more. Besides being horrible, they're also psychotic, perverted, delusional, and mean. They make other people's life miserable because they can. They take advantage of their authority by engaging in activities that can only be classified as either immoral or illegal. I describe these bullies from observations I made during office hours. How do these people entertain themselves on a Holiday?The first of three bosses is Dave Harken, played by Kevin Spacey. Dave is so skilled at publicly humiliating others that he might as well host the next Oscars. Dave knows that he can easily make Nick's dream come true, but won't. Next up is Jennifer Anniston's Dr. Julia Harris, the world's horniest dentist. Julia's instinctive habit of seducing the nearest conscious male would make an ordinary man rejoice, especially if you're her assistant, but not Dale. He fears that Julia's regular sexual stunts will jeopardize his engagement. And then there's Bobby Pellitt (Colin Farrell), who has recently took command of the chemical company that employs Kurt.

161,jonnyhavey,Balanced Casting: Bosses Better Be Nice!,8,10 July 2011,"Everyone who has ever worked can sympathize with having a boss that is horrible to be around. If not, everyone at least has someone in his or her life that makes life hell. Director Seth Gordon (""Four Christmases"") has exploited this idea in the perfectly casted, logically over-the-top, daydream comedy ""Horrible Bosses"". The exposition of the film is very intelligent establishing the relationship a trio of friends has with their respective bosses. Nick Hendricks (Jason Bateman, ""Paul"") works at a large corporation burning the candle on both ends in order to receive a promotion from his boss Dave Harken (Kevin Spacey, ""Casino Jack""). However, Harken is unequivocally evil and absorbs the position instead of giving Nick the job. When Nick tries to quit, Harkin threatens to ruin his life. Kurt Buckman (Jason Sudeikis, ""Hall Pass"") has a similar problem at a chemical plant when his boss Jack Pellit (Donald Sutherland, ""The Mechanic"") dies, leaving his crazy, coked up son, Bobby (Colin Farrell, ""The Way Back""), as the new boss. Conversely, Dale Arbus (Charlie Day, ""Going the Distance"") is a dental assistant to the overly nice and inappropriately sexy Dr. Julia Harris (Jennifer Aniston, ""Just Go With It""). After Julia blackmails him into not telling his fiancé that she is trying to sleep with him, Dale solidifies a scheme with Nick and Kurt to kill their bosses. With the help of proclaimed murder expert, Dean ""MF"" Jones (Jamie Foxx, ""Due Date""), nothing could go wrong as they challenge the limits of comedy procuring a belly full of laughs.Finally a great movie idea hasn't been wasted on a slapdash script, poor directing, and unworthy actors. Instead Director Gordon and his screenwriters have contrived a new kind of buddy comedy so ridiculous everyone can relate to it. This is achieved by the smartest casting of the year seamlessly balancing the star power of the protagonists (Bateman, Sudeikis and Day) and antagonists (Spacey, Farrel, and Aniston). Both parties are worthy of the audience's attention with each star distinguishing his or her self from the other with a unique formula of hilarity. TO make things even better Jamie Foxx can do no wrong with his portrayal of murder consultant MF.Everything is very smooth throughout the majority of the film until the climax is reached and the resolution takes place. Gordon directs a very clever film up to this point connecting all of the characters and expressing the audience's concerns, but when it begins to conclude the film is very lazy. A disconnect sets in that is not necessarily cliché, it just should have been much better. Also, Jennifer Aniston's sexual performance is so over-the-top viewers will either love it or hate it.""Horrible Bosses""' perfect balanced casting blends acting veterans with up-in-coming comedic stars to create a film that connects with the audience through awkward situations and laugh out loud humor.

The writing is vulgar and clever.Jason Bateman, Charlie Day and Jason Sudeikis play the three main guys getting pushed around by their evil bosses. They then hatch a plan to kill each others bosses. Kevin Spacey, Jennifer Aniston and Colin Farrell play those three evil bosses. You also get other big names like Jamie Foxx, Donald Sutherland and an unexpected cameo from Bob Newhart. Everyone is great, but I have to give a special props to Jennifer Aniston. We finally get to see her in a role that showcases more of her talent than everything else she has done combined. She's funny, sexy and pulls of some nasty lines with ease.What's interesting is that Horrible Bosses kind of follows the same formula as The Hangover; three guys getting themselves into a really terrible situation but situations are replaced with a crazy scheme to kill their bosses. The funniest aspect of the movie lies within three guys,obviously having no idea what they're getting themselves into and dealing with the situation in the worst way imaginable.Horrible Bosses has a strong cast, amusing dialogue, and entertaining banter between Nick, Dale, and Kurt. Charlie Day will have you laughing right from the start.Conclusion- Great comedy, doesn't disappoint, Hilarious! NOT for the kiddies, but great laughs for the grownups.",Horrible Bosses
163,rogerdob,Wears thin after awhile,4,8 July 2011,"I loved the way the movie starts out. Well written at the beginning the movie does a great job of setting up the premise...three bosses that are so morally bankrupt, mean, and bad, that the only recourse is to kill them. With some really funny moments, lines, and situations the movie is quite entertaining. Then it runs dry. The last 30 minutes seems to drag on and the writers gets sloppy. The movie wraps up far to neatly and conveniently.The standout performances in this film belongs to Charlie Day, who gave an excellent comedic performance of a man being sexually harassed, and Jennifer Aniston who performed her part wonderfully as the harasser.",Horrible Bosses
164,LuckyFour-LeafClover,Ever have a horrible boss?,7,14 September 2020,I'm thinking most people in their working career have dealt with a boss they didn't like. If not then you're lucky. Most people can appreciate this film on some level.It's not a comedy classic like Office Space revolving around the working environment but it's pleasant entertainment if not at times raunchy. Three guys deal with three different types of horrible bosses and plain revenge.I might just add I realize Jen Aniston's character is a wet dream to many teens and young guys (hey I'd include myself there) but she's not worth risking your marriage over. Imo anywayBut yeah as I said it's worth a watch if you're bored or looking for something,Horrible Bosses
165,kismit,Decent but probably not worthy of the cast.,6,9 July 2011,"Having recently watched Hangover 2 and Bad Teacher with mixed feelings I was actually looking forward to this film. Having watched it, I can't quite see where the strong reviews came from. Not as formulaic as Bad Teacher but not particularly clever. Spacey was just okay, Aniston was better, and Farrell was very good(but too little screen time for his contemptible character). I am not sure if Sudeikis wasn't carrying his weight or if it was the writing but he was easily the most replaceable of the leads. His lines just seemed like another SNL bit. I don't remember Charlie Day from any other work but he definitely injected some life into the film. Not bad for sure, but not something I would recommend you pay theatre prices for unless you go every weekend. Not as bizarre as Hangover or as crazy as Bridesmaids, but a few pretty good laughs.",Horrible Bosses
166,gilligan-11,More than funny enough,8,22 April 2012,"This movie scores points for originality and the clever use of crude humor. For example, how hilariously disconcerting and squirm-inducing is it to hear Jennifer Aniston, whom we came to know and love as the sweet Rachel on ""Friends,"" tell her befuddled male underling exactly what she wants to do with his schlong, grab his crotch, and behave like the horniest cougar on the Serengeti? VERY. Aniston plays one of the titular ""Horrible Bosses,"" and her storyline masterfully turns the whole stereotypical sexual harassment scenario on its head. Colin Farrell (near unrecognizable a la Tom Cruise in ""Tropic Thunder"") plays another horrible boss, although he doesn't get nearly enough screen time. And Kevin Spacey, who never seems to do a bad job in anything, is the quintessential boss-from-hell. The high concept here is that Charlie Day, Jason Bateman, and Jason Sudeikis—as the unjustly abused underlings—will kill each other's bosses in a comically bizarre take on Hitchcock's ""Strangers on a Train."" They enlist the help of M*****f**ker Jones (Jamie Foxx) as their ""kill mentor"" and hijinks inevitable ensue. Funny enough, and definitely good for more than a few laughs.

167,treeskier802,Fresh Spin On This Comedy,7,15 July 2011,"When I heard about Horrible Bosses, I couldn't help but think that this was a fresh spin of another successful comedy of the early 80s, 9 to 5 starring three women, Dolly Parton, Lilly Tomlin and Jane Fonda.Instead of three women who have one evil boss, we have three men who each have a horrible boss. Ultimately they decide their lives would be better if their bosses were dead. Unfortunately these three guys have no clue as to kill their bosses and this is where the comedy ensues. Watching these buffoons go from hiring a hit man to attempting re-con in order to do the deed themselves is hilarious. I particularly enjoyed the above camera shot in the parking lot where these fools couldn't even figure out which car had the right of way.Kevin Spacey was brilliant as Jason Bateman's evil boss. Jennifer Aniston was absolutely hot as a sexy dentist boss who enjoys overstepping boundaries. Colin Ferrel rounded out the boss cast.There really are not many movies like this one, so this film was something new and fresh. I certainly would recommend this film.

This Seth Gordon directed black comedy written by Michael Markowitz , John Francis Daley & Jonathan Goldstein would have all those dissatisfied employees out there vent out their feelings for their bosses.""Horrible Bosses"" is a hilarious comedy which makes you laugh at many places with some intelligently written & executed scenes while certain other plain childish. Ya it does threads through the clichéd path now & then but the comical though of the scriptwriters & execution of the director make you glued on to the screen. Though the tempo takes a while to pick up once the lead three start to chart out plans to bump off their bosses the pace picks up & things get riotous.Charlie Day as the dental assistant being sexually assaulted by his boss played by Jennifer Aniston ( she tries her level best to appear hot in her role of a ""maneater"" unsuccessfully at that ) is the show stealer with his comic antics & quirky one-liners. Jason Sudeikis second one of the trio with weakness for attractive women is first rate. Jason Bateman is the third of the trio is wooden , tires his best but futile in his attempt.Kevin Spacy as the manipulative & almost psychotic president of Comnidyne Industries for which Jason Bateman works has done a stupendous job . Almost everyone who watches his performance would hate him & would be rooting for his downfall & therein lies his success. Colin Farrel as a drug-addict , callous & wastrel son of Jason Sudsikis' boss who becomes his boss after the untimely death of the former is adequate.The man who steals the show is Jamie Foxx as Dean ""motherf$%ker "" Jones as small time crook who masquerades as a ""murder consultant"" & usurps cash from the innocent trio. The conversation involving him are damn funny . The point where his true identity is revealed is nicely done. Another scene that is humorous is the one in which Dale mistakenly hires a male prostitute thinking he is an assassin & the ensuing conversations.Along the way they have nicely touched upon current issues like the recession & the job scarcity following that , south Asian call-center employee with an American name involved in the customer service ."" Horrible bosses "" is an unadulterated comedy with the writers leaving no stones unturned without any logic whatsoever.

169,jcallows,As Dull As The Hangover,3,30 October 2011,"LIke The Hangover, the main characters were uninteresting and unlikable and had no chemistry. One was simply annoying. And that guy was Jason Sudeikis. What the heck was he doing there? How did he get the part?Anyway, like in The Hangover, the main characters experienced wildly, fantastic, knee- slapping events. And just as in The Hangover, I just stared blankly at the screen watching these guys try to make me laugh. I saw the cues where I was supposed to laugh but I couldn't. As time passed, it became more and more evident this film wasn't going to get funnier. So now the only thing that kept me watching was to see how the bosses got knocked off. Interestingly, The Hangover had a similar gimmick-- to find out what happened to the bachelor-- to keep people hanging around until the end.Despite my curiosity about the fate of the bosses, the shear dullness of this film kept me from watching the remaining 15 minutes. To be fair, I did laugh a few times. The film started out promising in the first 5 minutes, but just sputtered from there until the finish line (which I didn't really get to.) It felt like there was an opportunity here that was missed. This film had a good premise. Would it be a black comedy like Heathers? Or would it poke fun at the common, mundane work environment like Office Space? I laughed just thinking about it. The actual product ended up being neither and was just poorly executed. It would've been better as a half-hour TV show. In fact, it felt like one-- except it was stretched into 2 hours. Watch Office Space instead. Jennifer Aniston is in that too.",Horrible Bosses

It was too long and after deciding to kill their bosses it concentrated on just one boss for the rest of the film. So much so that the second came across as an after thought, the fate of whom the viewers found out about as the credits rolled!

171,AliceofX,Bumbling Idiots And Cartoonish Villains,6,9 March 2016,"There are some funny parts in Horrible Bosses but they are entirely predictable. Most of the time it's just not funny and instead of being smart it settles for being raunchy and explicit with crude, disgusting sex jokes.The bosses were too unrealistic. Zero subtlety was involved in their roles. Instead they just openly said how horrible they are in such a cartoonish way that it was hard to take the main characters situation seriously. It didn't develop any empathy for them. The only boss that really sticks in your mind is the one played by Kevin Spacey as the rest are barely given any time to develop as characters.Probably the best thing about this film was the three main characters. They had great chemistry together and you really liked watching their failures as they went about their mission like bumbling idiots. And that's what basically happens in the movie – despite their idiocy through sheer luck they manage to come on top and solve all their problems.Overall this is not a completely unwatchable movie and personally I rather liked it but I can't see myself ever recommending it to anyone or even watching it a second time.",Horrible Bosses
172,TourettesPersonal,Humorous Crimes,7,30 September 2011,"Horrible Bosses is too crazy for a dark comedy. We all know killing your boss is a cruel idea but in this film they're making it a joke. Despite from its cruelness, Horrible Bosses isn't horrible at all. It's undeniably hilarious. Too much fun by the performance of the cast. Horrible Bosses doesn't have a lot of gumption to its dark premise but it's all about the comedy. This is just a little comedy that you will enjoy all the time.The beginning of the film shows how horrible their bosses are. It's pretty reasonable why they wanted to kill them. But what's fascinating here is how the main three had a perfect chemistry to their horrible bosses. Especially when it comes to Charlie Day and Jennifer Aniston. Charlie Day made his role too innocent to get sexualized by Jennifer Aniston. He's like a child being harassed by a pedophile. Jason Bateman plays a hardworking man and Kevin Spacey is teasing him like a bully. Kevin Spacey is perfect for this role. Jason Sudeikis and Colin Farrel does their thing.The entire film is all about the laughs and the fun. Nothing else to say about the filmmaking. The movie is just funny. It doesn't have a knack to get serious in some parts. Its darkness is always hilarious. By the way this is a comedy. It's supposed to fun all the time. Yes, like even murder is funny.Horrible Bosses is not the kind of film that tries to be the best. It's just a little fun comedy. It's a movie that you'll still enjoy even if you've seen it many times. It's funny enough. It's clever enough. Most of the fun goes to the performances.

I must talk about Hangover coz it gave rise to such concepts after being a run away hit. Anyways i did have a laugh or a smile throughout the movie. The best part is that though its dark sometime but the mood is throughout funny and don't get serious. Jason, Charlie and Jason Bateman have done awesome job but Charlie is outstanding with some good liners. Colin Farrell, Kevin Spacey fits well in character and are equally humorous. Jennifer Aniston is actually too hot in her avatar. The direction is good maintaining the comic timing and fun element throughout. Dialogs are well written. I loved the story and concept.

There is only one thing that spoils this movie and prevents me giving it a 10 out of 10 and that is Jennifer Aniston. She is barely believable as an actress in any of the productions she has assaulted with her presence and this one is no different. I can appreciate that most guys wont see this, as she gets her breasts out during the movie and if that is the only way that this charlatan can get work, she should consider an alternative career.That aside, the other actors in this movie more than make up for Anistons lack.The idea isn't a new one and I would be lying if I said there weren't funnier takes on the ""disposal of boss / partner"" theme.

180,mad_mandonna,"An often amusing and fun comedy, that with a bit more spark could have been hilarious",6,26 July 2011,"We've all had them, haven't we that man or woman you despise in a position of power over you despite the fact they may not deserve that power. We all know or know of someone who abuses that little sprinkle of power that they have. I personally have worked in catering all my adult and half my teen-aged life, and that particular industry has those types of people in spades, even when you do everything in your power to please them, its still not enough! Ever fantasised about throwing said person out of a window, I know I have. I could just have a sick sense of humour that others may not share, but I generally have hated a lot of my bosses. So in comes Horrible Bosses, a film that promises to fore fill that immoral fantasy we cannot undertake.The promise is made, but unsurprisingly not kept. The Villains of the piece include Kevin Spacey's CEO of a major company, that tortures his employee's like a playground bully. We also have Colin Farrells, coke snorting, spoilt brat wannabe playboy who inherits his fathers company with no intention of upholding it's values. And Finally Jennifer Anistons nymphomaniac dentist, with a rather ridiculous obsession with her dental assistant. The bosses are delightfully horrible, Jennifer Anistons in particularly nasty and you can easily see why the employee's would want to off these particular human beings.Now the premise is here, it works for the most part and the bosses are in place. But now you need your employee's and I believe this is where the stumbling block may have been. They three male leads are funny and do have great moments , but there all one piece of the same puzzle. Variety is the spice of life so they say and more varied characters would have made this all the enjoyable. Having a female or a homosexual or an ethnic minority I believe would have been funnier. Jennifer Aniston coming on to her gay assistant as opposed to her straight one would have been far more entertaining and unexpected. Thats my own thought anyway, and many of the ethnic stereotypes in Horrible Bosses come across as a little crass.There some rather brilliant bits, two of the employee's getting high off cocaine dust is brilliant and the bosses seem to have a lot of fun here. Of the R rated films I've seen this year Horrible Bosses manages to come off somewhere in the middle, better than The Hangover: Part 2, but not quite as good as Bridesmaids. Its most comparable film is probably Bad Teacher, in that both films took some jokes too far while others didn't go far enough. I think with a smarter plot the film could have been wittier and more exciting, it manages to stagger on the line of entertaining without really stretching the audience in any way.Its a risk free comedy, that doesn't live up to the premise. There is much to enjoyed here, but generally this is a middle of the road comedy that had way more potential.",Horrible Bosses
181,IheartCali5882,"Very good story, very good actors.",7,4 October 2011,"What I most appreciated about this movie was this: Where lesser comedies take a plot on autopilot and rely solely on jokes to keep the audience entertained, the writers of Horrible Bosses have actually created a good story. Sure the theme has been done before in past films, but the writers of HB have managed to make their version fresh and edgy. For me the storyline was always interesting, never predictable. Even up until the last minutes, I had no idea where the plot was going to go. You can tell the creators put serious thought into their project, instead of what happens so often as of late where Hollywood producers greenlight those recycled, unimaginative paint-by-numbers type films.And credit also goes to the actors themselves who are pitch perfect in their roles. I see Jennifer Aniston has been getting a lot of attention for her role as the nymphomaniac dentist Dr. Harris. While I think she excels at comedy, it seems that here the dialogue of her character takes the credit. She's as good as she ever is, but the vulgarity of her characters' lines is what catches the audience off guard. Still I was pleased with her performance.Colin Farrell on the other hand, really kind of blew me away. If I hadn't known he was featured in the film, I wouldn't have recognized him. Who knew that he could pull off this comedic role so effortlessly? His was the role that gave me the most laughs. A truly unexpected surprise from Farrell. I never pegged him as a comedian.I could go on about each and every character; Jamie Foxx was hilarious as usual, Sideikis, Bateman, and Day are spot on (although Charlie Day's voice does start to get annoying about halfway through the movie), but it's enough to say that this is one of the better comedies I've seen in recent years.

186,stephenpaultaylor,I Laughed Once... Maybe Twice,5,9 November 2013,"To be completely honest, I'm surprised by the high rating of this movie. I would have assumed it would be more around the 5.9 area... not 6.9... but I digress.I love comedy. When a comedy is done well, I'm a happy, happy camper. However, this movie just wasn't funny. I felt like they were trying really hard to make me (and everyone else) laugh, but it just didn't work. I personally think that if Colin Farrell had way more screen time, the movie would have been much funnier. His comb-over, his twitches, his absurd mannerisms made him hands- down the funniest element of this movie, yet he only appears in two or three scenes.Kevin Spacey plays a carbon copy of Buddy Ackerman. The writers practically lifted his lines from Swimming With Sharks. I'm not sure if this was intentional or not. I do think, however, that SWS was a much funnier and fascinating movie.Charlie Day was hilarious in It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia but in this movie his screechy voice renders him almost unbearable to watch. His dilemma regarding his boss is also a tad unrealistic. His boss is the gorgeous Jennifer Aniston (who was very sexy in this movie) and her constant heavy flirtation with Dale is unbelievable to say the least, as is his disgust with her. I understand the character as not wanting to cheat on his wife, but I think that if a woman who is ten times as beautiful as his wife is constantly flirting with him, that he would suffer some sort of inner dilemma regarding the situation. We're all human. Yet in this movie, he seems utterly unphased by her advances.My other issue with the film is it's constant expletives. I've never been one to shy away from swearing. I'm not a prude. However, this film is littered with F-words and it just feels like the writers put them in with the thought that they would generate humour. They don't. They just make the characters look vulgar, tasteless and dumb. There is one line in the movie I laughed hard at. The rest inspired a few smirks and chuckles, but it was hardly a laugh-fest. Jennifer Aniston is ridiculously cute and Colin Farrell is hilarious. The three leads weren't funny, in my opinion. One character shoves a toothbrush up his butt. Wow... so funny. I watched The Odd Couple last week and I was astonished by how much I liked it. The movie was clever, frantic, full of very tight dialogue and visual humour. However, watching Horrible Bosses made me feel a bit sad about the state of comedy these days. Very few ""Comedy"" movies that are released these days inspire more than a giggle out of me. It would be nice to see a return to intelligent humour. Enough of this crude, potty-mouth, Adam Sandler-esque humour. Is this movie a reflection of the ""dumbing-down"" of America?

187,siobhanmckibbin,A horrible conventional comedy!,5,16 February 2012,"I thought when i saw Horrible Bosses advertised that it would be a pretty good comedy, especially considering the casting, but sadly i was wrong. A few funny bits here and there maybe, but not the kind of comedy that had my utmost attention the whole way through.Horrible Bosses stars Jason Bateman, Charlie Day and Jason Sudeikis as three best friends who all have the same problem; they hate their bosses. Bateman's boos is an egotistical jerk, who has lead him on since he took the job. Day's boss is a nymphomaniac, and Sudekis' new boss is a coke head, who does not care one bit about the company he now owns. What starts out as a joke between friends soon develops into something more dark and they are soon plotting ideas on how to kill each other's boss.The cast was very promising and the plot looked somewhat interesting, but sadly it failed to deliver. The jokes are unoriginal and the characters are fake. The movie tries to redeem itself with having Jennifer Aniston's character being rather dirty minded, thinking that unnecessary innuendos were the way forward, but even that was stale and unbelievable. The plot is rather predictable, and you can easily guess whats going to happen, so there's nothing really that takes you by surprise. I feel that the film could of contained more hilarious scenarios to the difficult situations and problems that the characters find themselves in. This just highlights the simplicity of the plot which the movie takes, instead of fully exploring the themes creatively. I'm not afraid to admit that i did laugh occasionally at Horrible Bosses, but i will stress it was just occasionally.Horrible Bosses is nothing more than an average comedy, which you won't really remember long after you've seen it.",Horrible Bosses

In particular, Day's formidable sense of humour helps this comedic experience become a continuous hell raiser. Although the film consistently and dangerously flirts with many offensive quarrels that many viewers may criticise director Seth Gordon's film for, the three protagonists strive to make their changes for the better. The material here may not be admirable to the masses due to its loud-mouth approach and disrespectful tone for the disabled, alcoholics and in particular those who work in dentistry, as this profession is usually tailored with a strong and positive sense of care and precision. Therefore, some may suffer to understand why such a film requires implementing such bad behaviour amongst middle-aged characters. But, as the genre of humour often mimics those who take life too seriously, this film offers an escape route for those who believe that they should be noticed for the commitment or difficulties they face during their daily shift.With multiple recognisable characters amongst the casting, the film offers various pointers of interest. The cast choosing is obvious due to the actors and actresses genre preferences, but to counter-balance this, the film offers comfort as we know what to expect from the faces on screen.",Horrible Bosses
191,Marthian80,Some good jokes but overall a bit dull,6,15 February 2017,"Horrible Bosses is about three male friends who each have a good reason to absolutely hate their boss. Nick (Jason Bateman) works for Mr Harken (Kevin Spacey) who refuses to promote him and blackmails him so he can't quit the job. Womanizer Kurt (Jason Sudeikis) actually likes his boss until he dies of a heart attack and his idiot son takes over. And finally we have Dale (Charlie Day) who works for Dr Julia (Jennifer Aniston) who sexually harasses him and also blackmails him so he can't take legal steps against her. The three decide that it would be best to kill their bosses and spend the rest of the movie on that quest, with hilarious results. There are some funny moments in the movie but overall I find it a bit dull. They could have done way much more with the situations created but they kept it very tame. I also found Jason Bateman's character boring so most of the humor had to come from Jason Sudeikis, Charlie Day and Kevin Spacey. They do their best but I think the movie would have been better with another big comedy star in a lead role. The main plot has some small twists which keep it interesting, but there is not much there that you haven't seen before. The supporting characters are hit and miss; I like Jamie Foxx in his role as 'consultant' but Jennifer Aniston's character was so over the top that it was no longer believable. I had the feeling they just put her in there to have a hot woman in the movie. So overall an amusing movie with some good jokes to watch on a weekday with but nothing special.",Horrible Bosses
192,WilderMovieReviews,Easily my favourite comedy of 2011,9,19 March 2012,"Easily my favourite comedy of 2011, with Crazy, Stupid, Love. coming a close second. The film is about three guys whose jobs are made hell by their bosses. They decide to kill them in a ""Strangers on a train"" style, where one kills another's boss so it can't be traced back to the employee. I wasn't sure what to expect from the cast that includes Kevin Spacey, Jason Bateman, Colin Farrell, Donald Sutherland, Jamie Foxx and Jennifer Aniston. Each fine actors but how would they fair in this film? Amazingly is how. Colin Farrell is almost unrecognizable as one of the bosses and Kevin Spacey is great as usual. However the stand out performance of the film is Jennifer Aniston. She plays a dentist, the boss of Dale (Charlie Day) and she is sexually harassing him. She really takes the role and plays it to perfection. Dale is her shy assistant who is engaged to Stacy (Lindsay Sloane). He is faithful to her and resists all advances from his over sexed boss. It is not a role we are used to seeing her play but it is a perfect performance. Another great performance was Jamie Foxx the murder consultant they hire. Horrible Bosses is a great comedy, almost a perfect comedy. The only flaw for me was it was all tied up a little too neatly. I saw the ending coming before it happened and it would have been nice to have an ending a little more surprising. Having said that I can't imagine how it could have been ended differently. The film doesn't have to resort to crude gags and just lets the script and performances of the cast tell the story. This works so well and full credit to the writers for a great comedy.",Horrible Bosses

And I wasn't disappointed. In fact, I was pleasantly surprised. Horrible Bosses was funny and included a number of unexpected plot twists. Still, I don't see any reason to rush out to see it in theaters, so I recommend you ""Wait for the instant download"".The story is all about three guys (Jason Bateman, Charlie Day and Jason Sudeikis) have horrible bosses (Kevin Spacey, Jennifer Anniston, and Colin Ferrill). Batemen's boss cheats him out of a promotion. Sudeikis' boss dies and his coke-head son takes over. And Charlie Day has the enviable problem of Jennifer Anniston's sexual advances. The boys decide the best thing to do is kill their bosses and pay M.F. Jones (Jamie Foxx) to give them assassin advice. And the boys go off on their journey to free themselves from their demons.This plot could have come right out of a Three Stooges movie. In fact, the boys fumble and stumble and slap each other in classic style. What has changed is an update for modern times. They deal with felons, drug abusers, and gratuitous sex. And it's as much fun as a barrel of monkeys.The film has no serious weaknesses except that it is a bit slow in the middle. Kevin Spacey is a great villain boss. Jennifer Anniston evokes her same sexy image with an upgrade to sexual predator. And Colin Ferrel delivers a believable jerk boss.There are points when we think we know what will come next. And sometimes the film is a bit predictable. But there are a number of unexpected twists that make the movie lively and worth the time spent.",Horrible Bosses

My wife was done with it a bit before I was, I guess I just kept expecting it to get better somehow, and rise above the gutter where it started out. But, it never got better. I was ashamed of Jennifer Aniston. I would challenge her with this: ""Ms. Aniston, would you take your mother to see this picture?""My wife was embarrassed by the women in the audience who were laughing at the sexual innuendo and crass jokes in that 1/2 hour of the movie we saw. One woman in particular was cackling like a fool. It reminds me of that scene in Forrest Gump where the guy is standing at our nation's capitol and he keeps getting the audience fired up by dropping the F-bomb. In that case it was an editorial comment on our society's downward plunge, in this case it's a sad commentary how far we've come that is all the writer's (and actors) have left to try to create ""Humor.""

203,FrostyChud,"Another ""Castrated Schlub"" comedy",5,22 August 2011,"What is the deal with guys in comedies like this being so aggressively typical? It seems like they're always eating at Applebee's. It's become a real genre over the last few years...movies about a bunch of pathetic regular guys...Hall Pass...Old School...The Hangover...I guess these movies make money. What they all seem to traffic in is the quivering fear of the Middle-Aged American Beta Male before Woman. Nothing like true femininity ever appears in these films: we either get exaggerated ""slut"" characters like Jennifer Aniston here (whose exaggerated sexuality makes her unrealistic and therefore non-threatening to us) or we get ""perfect"" (i.e. sexless and charmless) suburban wives. The end result is a barren, Eros-free wasteland inhabited by fake men and fake women. Here is the main problem with these movies: they are essentially powered by a fear of women, and there is something inherently boring and unfunny about a world created by men who hide their fear of life and women under a ""typical guy"" facade. ANYWAY, enough theorizing. This movie is just not that funny. It's only OK. Jason Bateman is, in my opinion, the funniest person here. He does his best with average material and manages to give his character some depth. Good for you Jason Bateman! For some reason I find you sympathetic. Jason Sudeikis is fine. Charlie Day, however, is NOT FUNNY. What an awful, grating voice and weak face he has. His final monologue is cringe-worthy. The premise of the movie is good but they made it about 30 percent too goofy and unrealistic. It would have been funnier if they had played it a little straighter and let the laughs come more naturally from the chemistry of the main characters. The whole thing is haunted by two other (better) movies: The Hangover (3 buddies on a wacky adventure) (the scene where Charlie Day is on the cellphone as Kevin Spacey rams them with his SUV was stolen directly from The Hangover) and Office Space (which was funny not because of the bland main characters or the plot but because of the details). There are a few laffs. The scene with the cocaine is funny. Some of the scenes with Jamie Foxx are kind of funny. Colin Farrell's character falls flat, as does Jennifer Aniston's, but it's not their fault. Kevin Spacey is excellent as always. Go see it if you want. It's OK.",Horrible Bosses

206,franciscoraposo72,The Best Movie I've seen since The Hangover,7,4 January 2012,"Lets start of by saying that before I've watched this movie, The Hangover was honestly my favorite movie, but this is not just the best movie i've seen since The Hangover, it's my new favorite movie, I can proudly say that this movie is better than The Hangover. First, it has one of the great casts ever, Jason Bateman, from Couples Retreat, Arrested Development, The Switch, Juno..., Jason Sudekis, from What Happens In Vegas, from an episode of It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia, from Going the Distance and from some other movies and Charlie Day is the other guy that completes the main cast, which turned out to be probably the most funny guy in this movie, he was no surprise, because if you saw him in Going the Distance and It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia, you wood understand, because Charlie rocked in this movie. The bosses cast is also amazing, it includes Kevin Spacey from several great movies, Colin Farell, which is also in several great movies, and the same thing about Aniston, who played the best role of her career, at least I think that way.Nick (Bateman), Kurt (Sudeikis) and Dale (Day), have all of them, one horrible boss, who are Nick's boss, Harken (Spacey), who's a Psycho, Kurt's boss Bobby Pellit (Farell), who's a Tool and Dale's boss, Julia Harris (Aniston), who's a Maneater. Dale, Kurt and Dale just hate their bosses a lot, but everyone of them have a reason to can't quit their jobs, Dale is in the Child Sex Offenders list and the rest of the guys can't quit because they know a role model of a role model of a fired person, who appears that be fired is not good it all. After being drunk at the bar, Nick, Kurt and Dale come up with the idea that wood make them happy forever after, which is to kill their bosses, it was only necessary another day of work to make them want to do that, so after having all figured out, they hire a hit-man, Dean Jones/MF Jones (Foxx), a guy who as been in jail for some years. Jones was only arrested because he committed piracy, so he will only tell some advices to the three folks and they will have to murder their bosses without now one doing the job for them. The plan is flawless, but the persons who are going to make it done... are not.Can you see how clever the story of the movie was? I mean, this was no copy to any movie, this was actually an excellent idea, who in the world wood come up with idea of making a movie about three guys who plan to kill their awful bosses, cause who did, invented the story for a movie that has smart jokes, very smart jokes and lots of them, it has a great cast, it's very entertaining and it's someone's favorite movie, such as me.

207,gere-c,Could be much better,5,4 December 2015,"A weak movie, which does not add anything in his comedy, but enough to yield a enough money to another commercial film comedy.He is not even really bad, is in the middle ground between good and bad, in my opinion, this for several reasons. Starting with the plot, the idea seemed to have everything to be done a good movie, and the fact that Kevin Spacey be in the movie made me more enthusiastic, but this was not well spent. The plot is rather forced and no depth at all, where it takes considerably until you reach the apex of the film (when the triplet put their ideas into practice), which is not great, but it lasts very little also, as soon arriving at the end, in addition to various cut scenes being ""cut"" in a bad way, including sexist forms, occasionally. Overall, it's a plot that could be well used, but it was not, not really.The acting is not great, actors like Kevin Spacey, Jennifer Aniston, that are actors already well known in several cinema films, were not put to good use, as well as fine secondary performances, they were very attached to their characters (where they had not much variation to be) and forced jokes. The rest, especially the actors that are most commonly in today's films, was also no big deal, just regular performances, did not see any highlighted, except for the actions of Charlie Day, who was the only one considered outside of the curve, but the Colin Farell was very disappointing, including the arrest of the character that had, in the same way as Kevin Spacey, for example.Basically this is a comedy that pays a good commercial profit but does not have anything new, anything really good or really worth investing your money or time on it.

We could honestly do without the titles of what kind of boss each boss is- it's enough to have the employee say it imho.The difficult part of the film for me was watching Jen Aniston in such a nasty role. Yes, she's attractive. Yes, I like Jen. But I much prefer her in roles not so Chelsea Handler-ish (which of course is Jen's lady crush and BFF).Anyway, for me, Charlie Day made this movie funny.

And considering the absolute mediocrity, in all ways, of the male dental assistant she keeps attempting to assault sexually, the set-up is ludicrous, except for the beer-guzzling, baseball cap-wearing frat-bro types who fantasize exactly this kind of thing.

215,gigadragon12,Word of Mouth Review: Horrible Bosses,8,10 July 2011,"Horrible Bosses is a crude, sexual, racial comedy that shocks you with its amoral characters without regard for morality, consciousness, or common sense.And we all love it. -Review Score: 8/10In case the previews weren't clear enough, this movie is about three friends who hate their bosses to the point they want to kill them. What lacks in the preview is how each person is ""trapped"" in their jobs (more on that quotation later) and some background on how they got into their various situations is touch and go, but that's a good thing because this is a comedy and not a serious movie.All the actors are good in their roles, Kevin Spacey is easily the star of the show as the only seemingly serious person in the entire plot. Charlie Day is probably going to be everyone's favorite as he essentially plays his character from Its Always Sunny In Philadelphia, except with a soul.The big issues (if your a real stickler like me) are the plot, and perhaps if I had gone to see this movie in a different mood, I wouldn't rate it so well. The sticklers are the plot. Just about every character threatens to leave their job at some point in the first part of the film, but something stops them. Not a single point that stops them is anything that would really stop someone in real life, so in essence it sort of dumbs down the characters, which gets really irritating as a reminder later on when Jason Bateman's character is attempting to be the moral center of the group. Also Jason Sudeikis' character's boss is so thrown together for the sake of having another bad guy that he is literally in the movie for a total of 5 or so minutes, the movie focusing a lot more on Jennifer Anniston and (even she takes a back seat) to Kevin Spacey's character.So a better title might have been Horrible Boss (Sexual Harassment, and Thrown Together reason to get a third comedian in here), rather than Horrible Bosses...BUT This movie is funny, and not just normal trashy funny its good trashy funny. Charlie Day is already associated with Its Always Sunny In Philadelphia which is GREAT Trashy Comedy, and this movie follows in the same footsteps with the annoying mild moral reasoning thrown in (though mostly as a joke). Also Ron White cameos about halfway through and literally does nothing, its like they just got him in there to surprise us with the fact that he's there, but he doesn't even make a funny, or at least not a memorable one.So... overall its fun and funny and there's no reason not to see this movie.

221,neji107,"A fun and creative comedy, but a lot of wasted potential!",7,6 July 2011,"Horrible Bosses hits the road running and starts right off with an interesting (and perhaps relatable) scenario. Three average Joe's decide they've had enough of their psychotic, incompetent, and nymphomaniacal bosses and seek out a hit-man to relieve them of their headaches. However, things go awry and the plan instead transforms into a Hitchcockian scheme to murder one another's bosses.As a comedy, Horrible Bosses really shines. The plot alone is a breath of fresh air, and when the jokes start rolling they don't let up. The film turned out to be a seamless flow of clever and engaging hilarity.The major disappointment was on the part of the boss characters. For goodness sakes, if you manage to nab Kevin Spacey, Colin Farrell, and Jennifer Aniston as your antagonists, you should award them with plenty of juicy, villainous screen time. Unfortunately that doesn't really happen, and it's a shameful waste of potential. For a comedy like this, the bosses were sufficiently shocking, but their characters were not as fleshed out as I would have liked to see. Still, don't let that discourage your interest in Horrible Bosses – it is guaranteed to entertain!7/10",Horrible Bosses
222,marcusdestorm,If I had a boss like that...,8,25 February 2012,"The first is the office worker who has been teased into thinking that he has a chance at the company Vice President position while sucking up to his grumpy boss (Kevin Spacey). Then we have the jumpy Dental Assistant, who's boss (Jennifer Aniston) is after more than just good hard work from her employee. The third man is one who loves his work, loves his boss and absolutely hates his boss's son who wastes life getting stoned and snorting cocaine. It is with an unforeseen and unfortunate accident, that the boss has a heart attack and dies. Now, with no interest in the company – just its profit for more drugs – our third man has the task of escaping the everyday woes of the dead boss's son (Colin Farrell). Armed with the intentions of hiring a hit man from one of the Personal Adds, things don't exactly work out the way they were intended. With added appearances by Jamie Fox and, it is the combined strength and character of this cast that makes the film what it is – very funny.Conclusion: Horrible Bosses is by no means a classic in the making like ""Hall Pass"" or ""The Hangover"", but it is one of the funniest films in a long time and will definitely get a good vote in the comedy section. If you are Renting this movie out or Buying it on disc, then it has to be on BluRay for the Extended bits, as well as the added Features which will also have you rolling around.A must have for the ""Aniston"" fan, as there are some pretty raunchy scenes in the movie where the average ""Friends"" fan would be wondering why there was never any such scenes like these in the series, but remember, it is a serious and down to Earth comedy that has been rated for 15 years and over.

I saw the trailer for this film while waiting for Transformers 3 and thought ""I'd like to see that"", and then promptly had my brains and will to live removed by Michael Bay and so forgot all about it. I was really bored last weekend and so when a friend suggested a trip to the flicks I agreed. The only film that looked remotely watchable was Horrible Bosses.Plot: Three friends hate their bosses. One boss is a mental coke addict / party boy, another boss is a mean, deranged control-freak, and the third is probably the sort of boss that many heterosexual men in the 18-65 age range dream about. The three friends all decide that their bosses must die, and hilarity ensues...Cast and acting: It is rare to see an all-star line-up such as this. And it is also uncommon to see every big name performing really well. I was so, so impressed. Worthy of special mention are Kevin Spacey (hilariously homicidal) and Jennifer Aniston. I should mention that I loathe ""Friends"" and genuinely never saw Aniston as attractive, but her portrayal of sexually unhinged, patient-molesting, prospective rapist of men Dr. Julia Harris D.D.S. had me rather hot under the collar.Memorable bits and bobs: Colin Farrell's hair, the box of cocaine, Dean Jones, Aniston's lab coat, Donald Sutherland, ""Gregory"", and many more.Overall: So good, I will probably go and watch it again.",Horrible Bosses

There are times when it gets a little physical, but on the whole the violence was kept to minimum, which I think is a good thing. It's definitely more of a (wise guy kind of) clever movie, and not a smash- and-grab-and-gore kind of a thing. The supporting characters were also rather interesting, and one of them in particular (a certain ""consultant"") is quite a surprise, in that he's not all that his appearance gives you the impression of.

After all, Rotten Tomatoes has 73% positive from the critics and 80% positive from audiences around the country. Must be good right? I found the film to be funny enough. Jasen Bateman is very good in his role as Nick Hendricks, the loyal employee trying to kiss Dave Harken's (Kevin Spacey) butt enough to get the coveted promotion to senior VP. Kevin Spacey - who is good in most every part I have seen him play - does and excellent job as the boss you just love to hate. Charlie Day plays Dale, a dental assistant, constantly being sexually harassed by his Dentist boss, Jennifer Aniston. The trio of friends is rounded out by Jason Sudeikis who plays Kurt who loves his boss but hates his bosses son. Of course, to move the movie forward, tragedy strikes, and Kurt must now suffer at the hands of Bobby (Colin Ferrell).The three buddies, lamenting their sorry work lives at the local bar, hatch a scheme to hire a hit-man to rid them of their ""Horrible Bosses"".

226,shannonmykayla,A little too much and not quite enough,6,9 April 2012,"Very rarely do I ever give reviews of movies, television programs, or anything in general to be honest, but this one, I just had to.Aside from the alluring cast members- Jennifer Aniston and Jason Batemen I chose to rent this movie because the title and concept of the movie hit home to me, well would have hit directly home about 2 and half years ago. I too had a horrible boss that was such a diabolical product she actually embodied in a very sly way, those of the characters that were projected. However not to the extreme lengths that Jennifer Ansiton portrayed, or to the psychotic depths of Kevin Spacey's character. My boss F.B was the perfect 40 year old self- righteous cocktail of everything poisonous and corrosive. Yes this is why I watched this movie, I figured that someone brilliant thought of a way to give a voice to all of us who wanted nothing more than to never have to either see, smell, hear, or even feel the presence of our bosses ever again. Bosses that we secretly hope have an allergic reaction to the vaccinations being given out at work. Bosses that make us sick to our stomach at just the thought of another minute working with them that can only be one's biggest test of fortitude, endurance, sanity, and long-suffering. Pretty much what Jason Batemen's character hit on in the movie- that the key to success is putting up with crap. That is what I hoped I was getting when I rented this movie, some sort of relation from a character that could put my story not just into words but into actions, of course in a humorous way. The result couldn't be more further from what I really got.I have to admit that Jennifer Aniston (ironically enough an idol of my former Boss) certainly stepped out of her comfort zone for this part, but she'd definitely have you believing that what you were watching was more of a scene from her reality show rather than an Actress playing a character, and playing it well.Jason Batemen, well we've seen him over the last few years make some pretty lasting impressions through his characters from Couple's Retreat to switching lives with Ryan Reynolds in The Change Up, to The Switch with Co-star Jennifer Aniston. Unfortunately though, his Character in Horrible Bosses was horribly boring. I am a fan of Jason Batemen, he has a tonne of potential, it's just unfortunate that the writers did not capitalize on that because although we love him, his character was horribly forgettable.With a few off-course twists and turns, almost inaudible sputters at the bar table with Jamie Foxx,an over active high pitched border-line annoying character played by Charlie Day, and a far more used than necessary amount of cheap vulgarity, this movie made the passing grade but only by a crack and a nose. There was a very thin line that crossed relation so that the far-fetched story was forgivable, however there was an overwhelming amount of the story that all you could do was shake your head and almost sarcastically say ""ok...."" while keeping in mind it's JUST a movie, based on a fictional story with fictional characters and it's not meant to be an outward projection of your own battles. Fine and dandy but when you mix too much dialogue, use an over abundance of sexual antics to steal the show, and not enough substance you wind up feeling overly and sickly full yet somehow still unsatisfied. But thanks to Charlie Day's character who accidentally found himself in a cloud of cocaine which ignited some pretty funny responses, as well as accidentally on purpose reviving Jason Batemen's character's boss, and to Jason Sudeikis who found a ingenious way for his boss to almost and as close to literally as possible- kiss his ass- this movie assigns some off the cuff laughs, a few over-due chuckles, meets the minimal deadlines, but disappointingly falls below it's quota.",Horrible Bosses
227,Nuz_Reviews,2011 Comedy of the Summer,8,12 July 2011,"I will just be completely frank with you, and tell you that this post will be pretty biased since I am a huge fan of the comedy flick. With that being said, tonight I saw Horrible Bosses. A gallow humor about three individuals whom desire to kill their bosses, played by Jason Bateman, Charlie Day, and Jason Sudeikis. In case you're not familiar with that comedic term, Merriam-Webster defines it as ""humor that makes fun of a life-threatening, disastrous, or terrifying situation."" Along with that completely accurate nomenclature to the comedy genre, I could also argue that this flick was a bromance, thriller, crime, and dark comedy. It really did remind me of an I Love You, Man twisted into a Pineapple Express.The cast for Horrible Bosses was quite superb. Bateman played his typical Arrested Development self, Charlie his high-voiced character from Sunny, and Sudeikis was just ol' SNL-style Sudeikis. They were all great. This was such a good casting for a comedy movie. All the characters seemed so real and meshed so well together to portray the story. It also co-starred Jennifer Aniston, Kevin Spacey, and Jamie Foxx, all of which did a fantastic job with their supporting roles. Aniston, the slut. Spacey, the crazy. Foxx, the bad-ass mother-$#!@er. Very comical and entertaining. Additionally, Modern Family's Julie Bowen played the wife of Kevin Spacey's character and did a fine job too. I really hope she appears more often. And, I'm waiting for Phil Dunphy to break out in a comedy film, by which I mean actor Ty Burrell. Anyways, more about the movie itself.I really enjoyed the pace of this movie. It was non-stop and everything was a twist-and-turn, nothing was expected and surprises were at each and every bend. On top of that, it was a rated-R so it had every word imaginable. As subtle as it seems it still makes it that much more funnier. And, all of the sexual tension was great.I would definitely recommend seeing this movie before it's out of the theaters.

And in the first few minutes I thought it was going to be good. I even admire Jennifer Aniston playing a totally evil slut, I think it takes guts for someone in her position to take that risk. But after a few minutes the writing just fell apart. The characters all started making the most imbecilic choices. A few five-year-olds would have been smarter about planning a murder. It was just beyond stupid. After ten minutes of one ridiculous choice after another, we finally left the theater because it felt like someone was hitting us over the head with a hammer.

229,torchwood949-166-552404,"Fun, But Flawed",6,7 February 2012,"There are times in our lives where we meet people who would love to kill, but what if we got the courage to do it? 'Horrible Bosses' is a comedy where our main protagonists pluck up the courage and decide to kill their truly evil bosses. With a concept like this it would be easy to completely destroy the general idea and create distasteful comedy full of crude humour and pop culture references but somehow manages to stay afloat. Kevin Spacey, Colin Farrell and Jennifer Aniston are our horrible bosses in the story and are each introduced with their own evil trait. Spacey first appears to be a manipulative, joyless long time financial boss, Farrell as the newly appointed narcissistic head of his fathers company and Aniston as nymphomaniac dentist. Each character has their moments but are essentially supporting characters.Though the script is often funny, 'Horrible Bosses' is far from perfect. It shy's away from the dark side in which it could have approached and wraps it's self up too neatly. The jokes can come across as hit and miss with some being just plain awkward and the stronger ones thrown around in passing conversation. A stand out character however is Jamie Foxx's who portrays a serial killer and steals the screen within the scenes it's in. The same however can't be said about the bosses though as, much as Spacey and Farrell portray really evil characters, Aniston's rarely reaches the same level as those and comes across as the weakest plot strand and disappears from the story for a lengthy amount of time to the point where it wouldn't be surprising if you forgot about her.Another major problem is its misogynistic approach to female characters within the story. Aniston's role is the only real main lead that women can have any real connection too, but her character is so exaggerated that it's difficult to find any key elements that they can relate too. There are other small female roles such as Spacey's wife but she is constantly referenced to committing adultery in derogatory ways. It's fine for a film to contain a male headline cast but when that's used as a tool to use prejudice sub context towards females it's hard not for it to surface above the comedy which should be the front hold.Though despite these criticisms there's a script there that is genuinely hilarious but could have been developed stronger and funnier if it decided to delve deeper into the dark story it is essentially playing. It's a fun way to spend two hours, the story is amusing, the script is strong and as a majority the cast manages to bring a special little something into each of their roles. I just wish it were a bit more horrible and a little less prejudice.",Horrible Bosses
230,galvanekps,A Rare Product From Hollywood: Real Comedy.,8,2 November 2011,"Well it seems that Hollywood can only do it about once every three to five years but Horrible Bosses is evidence that can do it when they want - make comedies that are actually funny.No political agendas, none of the stock premises like men are all stupid buffoons who couldn't live without some enlightened leftist woman to around to remind them to breath and wipe their bottoms or middle America is comprised of uneducated religious fanatics and closeted deviants ... none of the anti-male/anti-American/anti-religious screeds that have become the staple of Hollywood ""comedies"" the past few decades and driven theater patronage to new lows year after year, just funny.Can't comment on whether this is the best work of Jennifer Aniston's career as others have stated as I tend to avoid the movies and shows she typically appears so I have little to compare to but she is hilarious in Horrible Bosses.

236,Mattissimplythebest,"Sporadic, Stupid, Not Funny Enough",4,28 July 2011,"This movie has all the right ingredients to be an interesting and extremely funny comedy: excellent casting with Jason Bateman's sharp wit and Jennifer Aniston's comic timing complemented by Kevin Spacey playing what I saw as an over the top version of his Swimming with Sharks Buddy Ackerman, and a wish fulfilment plot line that we can all get fully behind. So the question given these ingredients why does the film fail so completely? I think the answer is simple: it just isn't funny enough. Don't get me wrong there are excellent moments where I found myself laughing out loud; there is one scene where Nick (Bateman) Dale (Charlie Day) and Kurt (Jason Sudeikis) break into a house which has some genuinely funny moments. However this is where we come back to that word ""moments"" - these hit you almost by surprise during the meandering storyline which becomes more stupid and predictable the further along in the movie we go; now I don't mind this if the laughs are still coming but in their absence the strange thing is you start to look more at the plot and with this film that is fatal. With a comparative film such as The Hangover the humour washes over the cracks of the storyline so that by the end you simply don't care that virtually none of the events were plausible; with this film I'm afraid the cracks sit their and gape at you. Another thing that annoys me is that Jennifer Aniston sets up the this wonderful character called Dr Julia - her horribleness is that she is a sex maniac who is harassing Dale to the point where she blackmails him into sleeping with her; however in the name of god knows what she gets sidelined (to be wedged back in here and there later on) in a plot which narrows down its focus to the two male horrible bosses. I'm not sure exactly why this is because it would have been great to have seen that side developed. Instead in the end you feel that because she (Jennifer Aniston) is a ""hottie"" the idea of actually killing her is not really going to be explored because she is ""hot"" - we don't need to think any more of it than that, just like Kurt who turns up to stake out her house to get information on her weaknesses we are supposed to simply think ""yep, I'd probably just screw her as well"" - and he does so. All this leaves you at the end feeling that this was a great idea for a movie but the one you've just watched doesn't live up to it.So I would say watch the DVD when it comes out or go on a half price cinema day - but don't pay full price for this when you could go and watch Bridesmaids which is much funnier.",Horrible Bosses

Each of the actors brings their own perspective of what's funny to the table and were seemingly given free rein to portray their talents. Depending on what the viewer finds funny however, there was about 20 minutes of solid entertainment. The only consistent style throughout was the use of its cutesy sexual humor which is what earned this movie 6 out of 10 stars but a solid 8 as a specific great date movie. The plot was rather enjoyable. 3 friends all hate their bosses and decide the only course of action is to off them. Not having any knowledge on how to kill someone, they seek the aid of a killer 'MF' Jones played by Jamie Foxx. This made for an interesting twist, partly because Jamie Foxx used to play a clown and became this GQ facade after Ray but in this movie seems to fall back into his original more fitting role of being a joke. Always Sunny in Philadelphia actor Charlie Day has to be noted as being the most influential character who sticks with you well after the movie is over partly because he becomes slightly annoying. For timing and uniqueness, no one can hold a candle to Kevin Spacey. There is really not a lot of substance or mentionable other than that.

While the 3 subordinate were well played too.I think ""Horrible Bosses"" is definitely one of the top of my list for a comedy, as, unlike some comedies which do not make any sense, ""Horrible Bosses"" did not make the actors act stupid to make the audience laugh, instead they have some smart dialogs and some funny acts that you would think it might really happen in real life too. the movie also had a lot of twist in the story, which was kind of surprising and unpredictable.

247,seansworks,"Comedy in pure crazy, silly, gross form",8,8 February 2014,"There's nothing more divisive in taste than comedy. Airplane! Can be either one of the funniest movies of all time, or something you just don't get at all. So when I say Horrible Bosses is damned funny, and sometimes just plain hilarious, I say that with my own taste in comedy firmly in place.And this is a comedy in the vein of Crazy, douchebag, and weird. If some guy getting back at his douche of a boss by rubbing the man's toothbrush along his ass seems funny, then this is your type of movie. If you think douchebag is an offensive word, then screw off and watch your own type of comedy.Because this is one in which three average, nice guys plot to kill their own crazy bosses for ruining their lives, and it's damned funny. The main cast all nail their parts, and manage to do so playing roles different from their most familiar parts. Jason Bateman isn't the blank faced niceguy from Arrested, he's still subtle but is a lot more confident. Charlie Day is the sweet bumbling nice guy here, but still manages to get all the comedy out of that. Jason Sudekis is horny average guy, and we relate to all of them.Which really makes the bosses the stars of the show. Aniston is damned hot, and a solidly crazy slut. Spacey is even better as an openly hostile and douchebag psychopath, the kind of person you might secretly suspect is in charge of many a large corporation. But Colin Farrel as the completely whacked cokehead steals the show in this case. I won't give it away, only to say I'd now automatically pay for any comedy Farell is in after this performance.So if you want three average idiots played by three solid comedy stars to square off against three others playing their most douchebag crazy for laughs, then this is for you. If random and explicit sex jokes, casual talk of murder, and well done if well worn gags like accidentally inhaling a bunch of cocaine aren't for you, then this movie isn't either.",Horrible Bosses

I have sat through some terrible movies in my lifetime, but this one actually took the biscuit. Not only did it take away two hours of my life it actually made me feel physical pain, and not from laughter I might add.The plot was so far from reality, so inane and so predictable that it was irritating rather than humorous. The jokes consisted of American toilet humour and forced slapstick. There was nothing new, intelligent or funny about this movie. If this film was meant to be a comedic satire then it failed on all levels, but I believe it was just a dumb movie.If this is what passes for ""good humour"" then the world is in trouble, serious trouble. What happened to the days when writers had an IQ and wrote sophisticated and genuinely funny movies? I haven't seen a box office ""funny"" movie from the 2000's that has been anything other than horrible inane American toilet humour, which isn't even funny. It's just stupid!

Why is it that every new Hollywood 'comedy' these days seems to feel the need to push the boundaries of bad taste ever further. Some of the language and sexual content matter of what we saw was really over the top and quite sick.The scenario is that three guys hate their respective bosses because they are bullied, sexually harassed and the third is uncaring about the staff which is in contrast to his dead father. Kevin Spacey was good as the bully, Jennifer awful as the sexual predator and her prey's whiny sissy voice was cringingly agonising. The third boss seemed just - well idiotic.It was so disappointing to hear the language that Jennifer Aniston spouted in the first 20 minutes and the motel scene with the three guys was extreme sleaze. The final straw for us was when they met a potential hit man (if that's who he turned out to be) called motherf****r which got repeated over and over in the scene.That was enough for us - we left.",Horrible Bosses

Don't get me wrong, there were some instances in which I laughed aloud, but I would be willing to bet it was when an ad lib was delivered instead of a line from a script. After I watched it, I was convinced that this was a script written during a night of circulating a joint. In my past, I came up with ""brilliant' ideas that in the light of day made no sense whatsoever. This movie got made based on the notoriety of the cast and director.

Some great comedies have paid more attention to theme, story arc, character development - all that stuff - but if you want sheer brutal comedic force, line for line, you've got to see this. At one point I was laughing so hard I couldn't catch my breath, a la Tom Hanks in the bathtub scene in ""The Money Pit"".It's rare I would pay to see the same movie again, but I want to see this one again soon to catch the lines I missed - there were many - because the laughter in the packed theater drowned them out.",Horrible Bosses

They slap each other around throughout the entire movie and is generally acting as you would expect your friendly neighborhood schlemiels to act.If you call this a comedy you might as well call it a crime story.

What was actually not so appealing to me was Jennifer Aniston taking such a role, someone of her stance in the industry (and age) should not resort to such minuscule roles that can be done by thousands of others. Being an A list celebrity she should be more wise in choosing her roles.

Scenes are loaded with sexual implications and too linear script with simple, cheap and predictable gag setup.

Though their behavior is reprehensible, they torment their employees with such hilarity you can't help asking for more of their scenes.Bateman and Sudeikis are both pretty good in their roles, too, with the former quite sympathetic and the latter giving a sardonic performance not unlike the one in Meet the Millers. In fact, this movie reminded me of that one, both in tone and humor. I enjoyed both equally and welcome this type of comedies.The weak link here is probably Charlie Day, While I wouldn't say I hated his role, I was left unimpressed with his grating, high- pitched voice and whiny character. I'd say he's tolerable and somewhat funny at times, but he was really walking on the edge, dangerously close to being just a tiny bit too annoying.Regardless, this is still a pretty entertaining comedy, both smart and funny, and a great option for movie night with friends. In fact this is a pretty safe choice for laughs with wide appeal, the kind you rented back in Blockbuster days that left everybody satisfied. Note: there's actually another hilarious performance in there I didn't mention, but I'd rather not spoil it. (+) Fun characters, great performances but the 'horrible bosses', tight plot, sharp dialogue and a fair share of laughs.(-) Actually fairly tame given the subject and R rating, it holds back a little and remains a step or two below legendary status.

266,Kratos666,"Compared to all other comedies done lately, this is a masterpiece!",9,2 January 2012,"""I'd like to bend her over a barrel and show her the fifty states."" I was in New York for two weeks for the second time now. I had some goals for the trip, like buying some comics, eating a genuine NY hot dog, a pizza slice, walking thru the Park etc. One of the main goals was to see a movie in the theatres, cuz I wanted to compare the differences between Finnish and American moviegoers. On a hot day, we ended to go to the theatre near Bloomingdales. 'Horrible Bosses' was our pick and that was a choice I'll never regret.Everyone of us has had our frustrations with our bosses. I can tell you now that I've hated everyone of 'em in some ways, some of 'em in all ways imaginable. But have I ever wanted them dead? No. These guys do. Nick (Bateman), Kurt (Sudeikis) and Dale (Day) have horrible bosses. The Anti-Christ, a coked up green belt and a sexy, horny dentist. Wait? Is the last one that horrible? It's obvious that these guys aren't the killa types, so they seek out for some help from a specialist called Muthafucker Jones (Foxx). With all the tattoos and the attitude, is Muthafucker the real deal? Well, he does give the guys the idea of 'em killing not their own bosses but instead making it a mixed killing. Nick kills Kurt's, Kurt Dale's and Dale Nick's. A simple plan that needs some recon. What could go wrong? The casting for the movie is great. The bosses are well-known performers. Kevin Spacey plays the Anti-Christ, Colin Farrell the coked up green belt and Aniston the sexy bitch. Especially Farrell tends to steal the movie completely. He reminded me of Les Grossman from Ben Stiller's 'Tropic Thunder'. It's like they're some sort of relatives. Farrell doesn't even have to say anything, just looking at him makes you mimic Stan Smith's laughter (American Dad!', anyone?).""I'm a green belt, motherf**ker!"" Aniston's character has probably the filthiest dialogue I've heard from a woman's mouth for a long time. She nails the role perfectly and I'm sure that most of us perverts are pleased to see her deepthroating an innocent banana in her lingerie. It's nice to see Aniston change her casting from these lame rom-coms and do something different. I think that this is her best role as a post-Friends actress.Kevin Spacey can nail any role so there's not that much to say about that. I'm pretty sure that if I would have a boss like Dave Harken, I'd be in jail right about yesterday. Looking at Spacey, Farrell and Aniston, their enjoyment of the roles is so apparent. The same goes for the ""good guys"".I had never seen Sudeikis before this (wait! after some IMDb viewing, 'Semi-Pro' proved me wrong) so there's nothing I can compare him to. But he was good in his role and that's all you need, right.Jason Bateman has done a long career and after a lame big screen start, he started to get some good roles after 'Juno', back in '07. The films I've seen him in, it looks as if he's been typecast. He does pretty much the same things, manners etc in his roles. But like I've said so many times now, it works.Charlie Day. I simply put love this guy! This is the first movie I've seen him in, but I've enjoyed 7 seasons of 'It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia'. Day is for me the new big hit in the comedy business. There is a problem though. If you've seen Day in 'Sunny in Philly', it doesn't differ that much from his character in the series. He is somewhat ""milder"" here but if he would do his stuff in 'Horrible Bosses' like he does in the series, the film would be something that the majority would probably not ""approve"". But I like offensive humor and parts of 'Horrible Bosses' humor is pretty offensive...I'm fed up with all these lame comedies that the studios defecate to us. 'Horrible Bosses' is something that needs to be done more often. Compared to the other (R-rated) comedies I've seen this year ('Hangover 2', 'Just Go With It'), 'Horrible Bosses' is superb. I enjoyed the film from start to finish. The mood was right, the characters quirky enough and the dialogue probably improvised and funny as hell. This was some crazy sh*t at best and at its ""worst"", I still had one hell of a time!",Horrible Bosses
267,abhitaliyan,Horrible Bosses: FlickyFriday Review,7,23 November 2011,"Horrible Bosses is a routine R-rated comedy affair with fairly entertaining twists and turns. Directed by Seth Gordon ( Four Christmasses) and backed up by a very dominating cast consisting of Kevin Spacey, Jennifor Aniston, Colin Farrell as 3 horrible bosses and Jason Bateman, Charlie Day, Jason Sudeikis as their lamentable employees, it takes you on a 95 minutes journey of bizarre and sometimes forced comedic moments.Movie is about 3 pitiful employees who are sick of their bosses. They loathe their bosses and their untowardly demeanor towards them. They blame them for their ruined or about to be ruined lives and finally when they just can't take it any more, they plan to kill their bosses. What follows next is the mixed bag of both funny and flat moments.Kevin Spacey as a paranoiac, vicious boss; Jennifer Aniston as a nymphomaniac, sexually harassing dentist and Colin Farrell as a coked- out, psychopathic nutcase were highlights of the movie. I think gags about recession-hit ex-investment banker, ""trimming the fat"" in the office and mother****** jones were best parts of the movie. Colin Farell nailed his cameo, he was ludicrously funny as Bobby Pellitt and I can easily say Bobby Pellit is the funniest comedy cameo after Tom Cruise's Les Grossman in Tropic Thunder. Jason Bateman and Jason Sudeikis were both likable in their roles but Charlie Adam's acting and handling of his role came out as a buzzkill for the movie. Some scenes were over the top and tried too hard to be funny. Writing is to be blamed for that, having such an interesting premise, supported by a cast of this calibre; they should have done better. But nonetheless, movie was laughable in most of its parts, while losing some of its steam in last the 15 minutes during that whole chase sequence.With everything considered Horrible Bosses is a movie with fair amount of hearty laughs and crude humor, swamped by its own sophomoric writing in certain parts. It's a Hit and Miss farce (with more hits) that in the end leaves you wishing it was funnier than it is.My Rating: 6.5/10, Definitely a one-time watch.",Horrible Bosses
268,Jon_Mathias,Hollywod Just Can't Do Comedy,3,25 November 2011,"A genuinely funny comedy film is extremely hard to make. Humour tends to work much better in shorter formats like TV episodes. However, films like Monty Python: Life of Brian show how it can be done. In Horrible Bosses, Hollywood once again shows how not to do it.The premise of three ordinary Joes wanting to kill their intolerable bosses is a good one and the first 40 minutes setting this up are OK. Kevin Spacey is excellent as the manipulative corporate monster and Jennifer Aniston is surprisingly good as the sexual predator, particularly as she has to act being sexually attracted to a whiny, bearded dwarf like Charlie Day. It's obvious that Aniston has only been cast for the novelty of having her talk dirty on screen but she makes a pretty good fist of the part. Colin Farrell puts in a pedestrian performance as a selfish coke head. Then the film starts to unravel with the bumbling attempts of the three stooges to accomplish their plan.The three leads (Bateman, Sudeikis and Day) just don't work as an ensemble at all. There is no chemistry between them and the lack of direction is woeful. The dialogue appears to be improvised, such is its lack of timing or comedy content. Day tries to steal scenes by talking very quickly in a screechy voice and the other two are just flat and unfunny. At no time do you feel sympathy for any of the three. Some of the attempts at humour are hopelessly out of date; do 21st century audiences really find a crude attempt at acting high on coke funny? The plot is also weak. For a great premise, the comedy possibilities were excellent but the story lurches from predictable misunderstanding to tired cliché to a ludicrous deus ex machina at the end. It cops out on dealing with the sexually predatory dentist, who is blackmailed by Day's character into leaving him alone, raising the obvious question of why he didn't just do that in the first place instead of involving himself in a plot to kill her.Hollywood has never been good at comedy but it doesn't seem to be getting any better. It's either bland and clichéd or else trying to get laughs from extreme behaviour (what the Yanks refer to as 'gross-out'). Neither is funny in itself. Good comedy, like good drama, starts with good writing. US TV comedy has learnt this lesson and been reborn as a result with shows like My Name is Earl, 30 Rock and Curb Your Enthusiasm.

Overly perverse in sexual ways, and definitely not appropriate for children, I suppose this dystopian film is a sad reflection of our reality. Ultimately, it reminds us that we are living in a society dominated by soulless corporations, which are riven by irrational, prejudicial, and feudal hierarchy.Kevin Spacey performed brilliantly, which should be expected of the second-best American actor era of his era (after Clint Eastwood), whilst Charlie Day is clearly becoming a modern Woody Allen or Charlie Chaplin. Furthermore, Jason Bateman was reminiscent of Ron Livingston in Office Space, or perhaps Tom Hanks in either The 'Burbs or Joe Versus the Volcano. James Foxx also deserves mention, for his first major role since Any Given Sunday. As for Colin Farrell, you can tell that he gave this role a lot of serious study. Meanwhile, Jennifer Aniston once again played herself perfectly.Horrible Bosses is highly recommended for anyone who liked Stone, Hesher, War of the Roses, Office Space, It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia, Arrested Development, Crash, or American Beauty.",Horrible Bosses

Now I'm no hit-man, but searching the 'Men Seeking Men' section of a newspaper for a cold- blooded killer seems a bit unusual to me – turns out is is.After a failed rendezvous with a potential erm.. accomplice, enter MotherF**ker Jones (Foxx), who enlists as the Murder Consultant and sets up a 'genius' scheme of how to take down the purveyors of injustice played by Spacey, Farrell and Aniston.Spacey shines as a stark, raving, mad, lunatic CEO who gets sheer joy out of being nothing short of cruel to Nick on a daily basis, think Mr. Burns and Scrooge combined and you'll be heading in the right direction.Aniston also gleams -A. For being so unbelievably attractive.andB. More appropriately for stepping outside of her usual character role and really letting loose with some seriously explicit vocabulary – the kind of things you'd never expect to hear from the former Rachel Green.The trailers and early footage made the film look incredibly promising but as seems to be the case with recently hyped films, it hasn't surpassed expectations and though the laughs are there, the constant dithering about from the harassed workers turn the laughs to half hearted chortles.It's actually a film about inspiration if you think about it, so if you snipe your employer on Monday and get the promotion you've been seeking it can't be totally horrible.6/10 http://wp.me/p1AJJT-sM",Horrible Bosses

272,Diorafan05,Genuinely funny,6,22 November 2012,"Comedy has come a long way over the last couple of years. These days the genre relies very heavily on sex humour and jokes. This is fine with me. I find that element quite funny. For some it is considered toilet humour. And it isn't appealing to a majority due to it being considered cheap. The difficult part is combining a story to go around it. 'Horrible Bosses' ingeniously manages to succeed in adding a story to the comedy. What is especially unique about this film is how comedy arises from every scene. There is not a single moment that is devoid of laughter. The film' theme isn't entirely original. It follows in the same tradition as other work based films such as 'Nine to five', 'Office Space' and 'Office Killer'. Clearly the inspiration is evident. But much similarity is at a minimum level. It is ironic seeing Jennifer Anniston cast in this as she was also in 'Office Space'. The story basically revolves around three men who belong to different professions who decide to murder their respective bosses. Each has personal issues that make it difficult to work. Charlie Day is a dental assistant who is constantly being sexually harassed by Anniston. Then we have Jason Sudekis who is being controlled by Colin Ferral. And Jason Batemen who is being slave driven by Kevin Spacey without being offered promotion. Murder is taken in to consideration because they feel quitting will only hinder their career prospects. They realise that they are not equipped to do this without professional help, seek advice from Jamie Fox. They soon go about trying to put their plan in to motion. But hilarious results ensue due to some mishaps. Spacey has issues with his wife which only leads to inconveniences.The whole aspect about the plot is that the three characters face difficulty in accomplishing their murder plan despite taking advise from someone else. Their attempts were immature and this served at the best recipe for comedy. The scenario is a little unrealistic but how it was depicted in a comical manner is what makes this film shine. The three leads give their best performances and it is their interactions with each other that makes this fun to watch. Charlie Day is exceptionally the core f the movie. Every dialogue and situation he encounters is rib tickling. Jason Sudekis gives good support and Bateman however was limited in his involvement.The film excels in every department. And it amazes me how comedy arises from every moment. The quality lies within the dialogues and not particularly the plot. For instance the first scene with Jamie Fox had a double meaning. We the audience think he is implying to his mother in a rude manner, but it was referred to in a normal tone. Full credit goes to the writer",Horrible Bosses

This movie was so funny, I couldn't stop laughing. When I started it I wasn't expecting too much, but oh my god this film made my day. HILARIOUS is a huge word for me, but this movie was, in fact, hilariously funny, and without even trying (of course they tried hard to make this movie funny, but while watching it you don't notice, because it's so amazing) The plot and characters are nothing out-of-this-world, but I have so much fun, I laughed so hard and I enjoy myself so badly, that I have to give it 9 hole, beautiful, bright stars.",Horrible Bosses

They couldn't have been doing it for the credibility as the script was unbelievably lame. They couldn't have been doing it for the laughs, as the jokes were consistently low-brow, unfunny stereotypes. The jokes, even when viewed as ironic or cringe-worthy, were consistently terrible. I don't mind swearing or crudity, but it should be within the context of a halfway intelligent script, otherwise it's just rubbish schoolboy humor.Even a script containing bumbling idiots needs a degree of believability about it. This movie, even when viewed as nothing more than a brain-dead comedy, is repeatedly stupid. The three guys being tormented by their bosses continually make out-of-character mistakes.I was genuinely offended that actors like Kevin Spacey and Colin Farrell would lower themselves to this guff. Jason Bateman not so much, as he seems to be finding his niche with these kind of movies. (See The Change-Up)",Horrible Bosses

276,scunnered_again,Horrible...no just disappointing,6,24 July 2011,"Having seen some of the trailers for this film, I was looking forward to a really funny 'Saturday-night-at-the-movies' film. Unfortunately Horrible Bosses didn't live up to the hype. The laugh-out-loud moments were just too few in number and the strand of the storyline , which involved Jennifer Aniston was quite uncomfortable to watch. I say this as had it been a female employee with a male boss then some of the scenes would have taken on a creepier edge. The strongest storyline was Justin Bateman's with Kevin Spacey as his over-the-top boss - a character, which was very easy to hate. Colin Farrell's character was criminally under-used and Jason Sudeikis's character was a wee bit too irritating. I reckon that this film could have been much better but if you lower your expectations then maybe you won't be as disappointed.",Horrible Bosses

After a boozy night they decide to take some positive action and decide to hire someone to do the dirty deed, that quest in itself is an hilarious bout of gaffs. So the action begins and to say much more about the plot would be to spoil it for the viewer. Just to say if you liked the Hangover you will love this. Colin Farrell was unrecognisable, Jennifer Aniston can act, Spacey was brilliant as one of the bosses. The car chases were great . Jason Bateman, P.J.

278,mounachab,The film the hangover part 2 should of been!,8,30 July 2011,"Funniest film of the year no doubt and was a big surprise to how good it actually was. The 3 friends who decide it would be in their best interest to kill their bosses are fantastic together and brings a similar comradery or 'wolfpack' to the hangover. The way they bounce of each other is fantastic and i lost count on how many occasions the cinema audience burst out with uncontrollable laughter, young, old, female or male. Okay, so what they decide to do sounds completely evil and sinister but you find yourself rooting for the guys in a tale of many twists and turns. Over here in the U.K Jason Bateman is the only one of the trio that many will recognise from recent roles in couples retreat or hancock or even far less recently in Teen Wolf two!! But the other guys Charlie Day and Jason Sudeikis were brilliant and I can see only bigger things in store for both. Bateman is the straight man of the three and Day and Sudeikis just fight out to see who is deemed the comic relief of the three. Its very close too!!The first 15-20 minutes was not the best of starts to a film and it may be fair to say that the three bosses are the weak points to film. Spacey who is an amazing actor just didn't seem to suit the role for me and wasn't believable. Farrell took a page out of Tom Cruise's book from Tropic Thunder but was still fairly funny and there was Aninston who plays nympho boss Dr Julia Harris. Who let's face it!! Was hot in this film. Really hot!!! I think all three were okay, its just that the three of Day, Bateman and Sudeikis totally outshone them.The film did start to get much better when the three decided that killing their bosses may be a good idea. They begin plotting, carrying out research and following covert operations which lead to meeting other interesting characters along the way such as; A hilarious misunderstanding involving Ioan Gruffyd, An unusual character and name in Jamie Fox and a sat nav operator in Gregory.Some classic, laugh out moments and for me this is easily film of the year so far...I had the same feeling coming out from watching this movie as I did when I watched hangover 1...

From the opening scenes to the ridiculous end it was not really funny to us and perhaps to any Australian or British audience. British comedy was like this back in the 1950's in such as the carry on series, mainly slapstick humour. Thankfully British humour came of age with Monty Python and others. Don't expect much more from this film than childish humour as experienced in three Stooges films and alike.I don't know what's funny about an aerial view of three cars trying to get out of a car park or brushing your arse with your bosses tooth brush.

They even destroyed what could have been funny, like when he inhaled the drugs, but even that joke couldn't make me smile. Dales voice was unbearable and annoying. anistons role was sexist and cruel to watch her. the story didn't go somewhere, even if it was a good idea to have horrible bosses, they couldn't realize this concept in the movie.

Once they make their decision that decides the plot it becomes funnier and funnier. You get into it as much as they do. They panic, you panic, once they get in trouble, you get worried for them. there are a few points on the movie where you can go over any possible outcome and still be surprised at what happens next.

Basically,3 high school best friends are always talking about how much they love their job, but hate their bosses(hence the title). All 3 of the men star in other comedy films, including 'This is where I leave you' which for me was a smash hit! So eventually, one of them come up with the idea of killing their own boss, which doesn't go well at first, so they decide to hire an assassin. But, that goes even worse, as he is not an assassin, and then they meet a guy who says he is an assassin, but turns out to be a piracy copier. The 3 men don't have the best of luck, until they decide to take it into their on hands, and kill someone else's boss, other than their own. For one of them, it goes to plan in a very random twist that got me laughing my head off. But not so much for the other two, instead, one boss is blackmailed, and the other is saved from death.To be honest with all of you, it's a very random storyline, but it's a perfect comedy, which my boyfriend and I loved!

284,janetki-imdb,In one word: MEH.,4,14 July 2011,"There's an incredible amount of comedic talent in Horrible Bosses: Charlie Day, Jason Bateman, Jason Sudeikis, Kevin Spacey, Colin Farrell, Jamie Foxx, and Jennifer Aniston (yes, she CAN be funny). Sometimes when you have too much talent in a movie, you think that talent will cover up the lack of creativity or a need for good writing. I did get some good chuckles in. But I couldn't get over the outlandish plot turns. I don't expect anything to be believable when I step into a movie theater, but I want to be courted into the movie's suspension of disbelief. The three main dudes: Sudeikis, Day, and Bateman are pretty much the same characters they play in any other movie/TV show (except that Sudeikis is uncomfortably sleazy). That's not really a complaint, these guys are aces. Especially Charlie Day. As each day passes, my love for this man grows stronger and deeper. He's so goddamn lovable – I want to tell the whole world to watch It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia. Hands down one of the best shows on TV. I'd put it up there with Arrested Development. Actually, it has some strong parallels with Arrested Development – a family of despicable, bickering fools with black holes for hearts. Only there's a huge class divide between these two families – I kind of like that the folks in It's Always Sunny are working class, because it lends them to do things like dumpster diving, trying to get welfare, and making friends with bums under the bridge.

Anyway I went to see it again the next day and came out with both sides aching this time! So It's an absolutely crazy, mad, OTT and knock-out movie, right into the class of stuffs made in 80s.

All of the actors in this film were perfect for this movie and the acting was superb! This is a movie that should be watched for the entertainment factor and when you just need a great laugh.

This movie was not only fun, it was unpredictable. We knew the idea from the beginning three guys have horrible bosses they want to kill but how it's played out is what's fantastic. Another great thing about this movie is the A list celebrities who play the bosses, (Kevin Space, Colin Farrell and Jennifer Aniston) and the ""murder consultant"" Jamie Foxx.

All the characters were one dimensional and complete morons at that. Charlie Day basically plays his Charlie character from IASIP, but the Charlie from the very first episodes when he was still just a dim-witted loser and a fairly ""normal"" person. Now, I love IASIP and Charlie Day on that series but here it just doesn't work at all. None of the IASIP chemistry and outrageous yet hilarious humor is to be found here. His character doesn't work well on its own it seems. And the other two lead characters are just so badly drawn ones you never really get to rooting for them or even getting a sense of who they are. I guess everyone can relate to their hatred of their bosses so no real effort needed. And on the subject, the boss characters are just too much over the top, in this case with unfunny results.Now throw in some rather racist stereotype jokes, which in their right environment could be funny if done in the tastefully crass ironically mocking style of say, South Park.

I knew he would be, because I watch ""It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia"", and he was funny in ""Going the Distance"" as well.

I loved Charlie Day's character in this film as he is always fun to watch. Jennifer Aniston's character was so sexy to watch that any young man would show some interest. As it was said before it was good to see her do something new and she nailed every sexy/dirty line. Another character I loved partially because he usually never does comedies was Colin Farrells as the coke head boss. He really went out did himself for it and it shows.The script in this movie was so well done and had some really raunchy and crude things in there but it was acted and portrayed so well it made it even the more better. The dirty and sexual dialog was hilarious, it was hard not to laugh and it showed they weren't afraid to hold anything back.This movie is a great summer flick and I highly recommend this comedy.

I gotta say, I would've been better off letting my friend just in the theater while I spent my 98 minutes peacefully reading a book at Barnes and Nobles. This has got to be the worst movie I have ever seen! Let's start with the plot: three guys hate their bosses so the best thing to do is quit/find another job? No. Report their bosses? No. Ah that's right: let's murder them. The three main characters were annoying and over-the-top. They were too stupid to actually be believable. The dialogue was just an endless stream off curse words, sex jokes, and dirty humor which is typical in ""comedies"" these days. Last time I checked, comedies were supposed to be oh I don't know funny! The movie also had no ""heart"". The writers wanted this movie to be simply another dirty, raunchy comedy with absolutely no substance! The writers could've given the ""evil bosses"" a reason for the way they acted. It could've been a movie about understand different points-of-views and people's experiences but no...it was simply a movie about three guys who want to commit first-degree murder because they don't their bosses. There was absolutely nothing funny about that concept at all.What's up with Jamie Foxx's character who served no purpose than to be the stereotypical black guy with a criminal record and the street cred. And while we're on the subject of stereotypes let's not forget the movie's ode to outsourcing with the Indian guy ""Gregory"" operating customer service for a built in GPS. He ""saves the day"" (go see the movie if you really really want to).My advice: don't spend a dime on this movie. Sneak into, wait for it to come out on DVD, whatever...this movie was the worst.

The closest situation to reality was the one between spacey and bateman. Jennifer Anniston's persona was so unrealistic that it failed to become funny, and collin farrel was heavily under played resulting to somewhat fall on the side.There were a few laughs don mistake me but in general i laughed less than the times that i thought ""Why do they have to be so crude and vulgar..is that what funny has become now days?""

The three bosses are nothing other than a douchebag, slutty and Psychopath. Even though the Comedy is mostly dirty but a good time pass.The plot is flooded with the twist and turns. In total the movie is unpredictable that makes it different from the others of its class. Some scenes like one coating boss's toothbrush with his arse, Aniston's foul mouth and her hunger for sex make you roll on the floor laughing.Lets have some critics eye here now, the story wasn't really that great. Even the scenes would have better linkage between them. At some scenes you will be frustrated.",Horrible Bosses
308,jeffreytull1960,"Horrible Bosses? ...More like ""Horrible Hangover""",1,9 July 2012,"This movie makes me furious. I expected a funny guy-romp a la Hangover with a decent, capable cast and all I got was this. Like a pin in my eye. Its plot was pathetically weak. Totally unsophisticated humor. It was poorly written. It was poorly executed. It was, in a word, horrible.Then ensemble has some promising talent but when they give the majority of the lines in the movie to the guy with the MOST annoying voice I've ever heard in film, (a whiny, whimpering, screeching Charlie Day), one has to wonder how anyone could continue to sit and watch. Honestly, I am mad at myself for having done so. It would have been easier and much less painful to sit and listen to a coked-up Gilbert Gottfried read from the telephone directory all evening.I expected more from the 'Jasons' (Bateman and Sudekis). Hey, JB was mega-funny in Arrested Development and if your last name is ""Sudekis"" you're just naturally born being funny, right? Not so. His character was a boring sex crazed tool. Colin Farrell, by my guess, appears in the film for about ten minutes total. Jamie Foxx was equally ignored and a bit superfluous to the story. The writers had assets they didn't know how to use.Concerning Jamie Foxx. Didn't this man win an Academy Award a few years back? Why is he back to playing the hood rat with the stereotypical street name? His agent said ""Yes Jamie, this is where you wanna go""? This movie was beneath him.And what about Kevin Spacey, who clearly was the veteran actor here? Are they foreclosing on his mansion or something? This man was brilliant in so many movies. Here he played a psychotic, jealous husband; a popcorn fart of a character for an actor of his depth and a disappointment for the audience wanting more.The bad writing doomed this stink-bomb from the start. The actors had precious little to work with here. The whole movie was amazingly flimsy. It premise is shopworn and worthy of a TV episode. The writers somehow decided it would be okay to substitute substance with skank (cue Jennifer Aniston!). They owned up to their unoriginality with a few feeble, unfunny ""Throw Mama From The Train' references, proving THEY KNEW there's very little original going on here in the way of humor, dialogue, plot or anything.Horrible Bosses? There's a horrible screenplay with a horrible premise and horrible humor. It pretends,...PRETENDS to be Hangover. It should be called 'Horrible Hangover'. Now how entertaining is THAT?",Horrible Bosses

The movie has its moments but I found it to be the same joke (for the most part) stretched out for 100 minutes. Jennifer Aniston got to play ""against type"" and largely pulled off a portrayal of an over-sexed woman boss. Lots of four-letter words. ""Horrible Bosses"" is loosely based on the 1987 movie ""Throw Momma From the Train"" which was based on Alfred Hitchcock's ""Strangers on a Train"" made in 1951. Both movies receive a passing nod from the main characters. Bottom line, I saw using a discounted ticket and I overpaid. Save your money.

I'm still trying to figure out what was funny about the Hangover. For me this movie hit, consistently, where Hangover missed. In terms of comedic appeal, this was up there with Role Models, another brilliantly executed comedy (Paul Rudd could easily have played the Jason Batemen role, but JB pulled it off with his own brand of comedic flair). People have problems with stereotypes?? C'mon folks, that's the idea (with some twists). Great screenplay, well-directed (wtg, Seth). Sudekis was smooth and still funny and Charlie Day was the hilarious foil, kind of a cross between Galifianakis and Goldthwait.

311,Agatha666,Predictable but funny,5,20 December 2011,"I am the first to admit that horrible bosses had some funny moments. I found myself laughing almost inadvertently. That being said, I did not really enjoy this film. This falls into the gross out comedy specter for me and I didn't really get into the story. The premise is three guys hate their bosses and decide to kill them and the hijinks begin. The problem with this film is you didn't feel the depth of how bad these bosses are. You barely explore the relationships between the characters before the dumb jokes begin. Everything in this story is typical. Kevin Spacey was a great deal more entertaining in Swimming with Sharks. Every overplayed joke in the book is used in this film. The characters dropping the cocaine and inadvertently getting high from the cocaine dust. The Indian customer service rep with an American name. All of this has been seen and done before. If you are the kind of movie viewer that wants to sit on the sofa, pop open a beer and have a couple of laughs you will probably enjoy this.

Well, they didn't do a very good job. Three guys have problems with their bosses, so they decide to kill them?

This is far more the caliber of Bridesmaids than Mr. Deeds. All the actors work brilliantly together and it was so witty and fresh that I did not want it to end. Even though Jason Bateman plays the same character in most of his comedies his timing is great and he is always funny. I laughed hard and loudly so I am glad I didn't see it at the theater. Yes, there are some corny and preposterous bits of luck as with all of these kinds of movies that I used to avoid but this one is worth it. Jamie Foxx has several scene stealing moments.

There were a few forced laughs, but the characters and scenes were weak in every respect--there is nothing to care for in these characters, in the plot, nor in the design of the film; it's essentially a romper-room for grown men behaving like mindless teenagers, with a plot that bears only superficial relation to probable frustrations and how we might confront them (even comedies deserve some element of realism).It's these types of films that make me think: ""If only we could take all the money that went into this film--both during its making and from its profits--and divert it to humanitarian aid.""

320,badumtssh,'Horrible Bosses': A Performance Review,4,8 January 2012,"There are a few laughs in 'Horrible Bosses.' Kevin Spacey, Jennifer Aniston, and Colin Farrell seem to be having fun playing the titular bosses. And Charlie Day is enjoyable, at least when he can stop shrieking long enough to spit out a decent line. But beyond that, there's not much to enjoy in this lazy, forgettable attempt at a black comedy.The movie focuses on three ordinary guys, played by Jason Bateman, Charlie Day, and Jason Sudeikis, who plot to kill their bosses for no reason other than that their bosses are jerks, and they can't simply quit because, like, it's a recession and stuff, and it's bad out there ya know? Like, so bad that their former investment banker classmate is giving out $50 handjobs! And loudly announcing that fact in his hometown bar, because that is what a recession does to people. Look, I get that the concept isn't supposed to be taken seriously. We're just supposed to sit back and roll with it and wait for the humorous and outlandish consequences that will inevitably result from this wacky scenario. Yet the movie goes to great lengths to rationalize the protagonists' decision, which comes off as a lot of clunky exposition in which the characters do a lot of sitting around and bluntly stating things that they should already know about one another. The result is an odd mix of tones, where the film tries to stay grounded when it would really do better to just commit to being wacky.Another problem with this movie is the ""raunchy"" humor. Raunch has been done to death, and let's face it, it's just lazy. When we first meet Jennifer Aniston's character, she's talking about fingering herself to Penn Badgely. Haha, shock value! Jennifer Aniston is totally playing against type! And then, the joke just goes on and on, with the raunch escalating in every scene. Aside from the disturbing double standard being employed here, in which the audience is expected to find hilarity in a female boss aggressively sexually harassing a male employee, the joke is just plain lazy. As are the endless series of dick jokes that only 8 year-olds would find funny. Don't get me wrong, I appreciate a well-crafted dirty joke, but I also don't believe that ""dirty"" is always an acceptable alternative to ""clever"". But maybe that's just me.Issues aside, 'Horrible Bosses' isn't altogether terrible. Like I said, it's good for a few laughs. But mostly what you've got is a pretty lame black comedy with a predictable plot, leads who are enjoyable but have zero chemistry with one another, and a whole genital-oriented humor. But hey, Colin Farrell's got a bad combover! P.S. If Colin Farrell's character routinely held hookers-and-blow parties in his office, how hard would it have been to just tip off the cops and get the guy arrested instead of killing him?",Horrible Bosses
321,Ul_Ko,truly one of the worst comedies I have ever seen,1,9 August 2014,"I saw the good reviews on IMDb and watched this movie the other day. It was truly the worst bunch of cliché jokes I have ever seen. Moreover, many of these jokes just insult some categorised people such as black, migrant and fat people. The scenario starts very catchy and it keeps the audience curious. However, I found it very weird how the movie tries to show the boss and worker relationship (giving money to worker and owning him/her) in a funny way. Because it is simply not funny. This is nothing else than slavery. Therefore, in many parts of the movie, I asked myself if I should laugh or not. Right after the movie presents the relationship between the bosses and workers it continues with a murder attempt story, which is another outrageous part of the scenario. I mean, should we really laugh at that some people tries to kill others. And at that point the movie shows to audience the classical three white American male and their story with black, Indian (migrant), Asian, fat people with so called ""jokes"" which is simply ugly. If you are a person who watches movies with a bit of critique, I do not recommend that movie. It is simply a waste of time.",Horrible Bosses

Some great scenes involving crude/sexual/racial humor that catch you off guard and have you rolling. The plot is a little forced, as was the ending, which is partially forgivable in the case of a comedy, as long as it makes you laugh. Seeing Kevin Spacey play asshole boss brought back fond memories (Swimming With Sharks), he pulls it off very well. Jennifer Aniston very outside her standard girly role, and it was awesome.

324,sreeya-wiesner,Hilarious comedy!,7,11 July 2011,"In this hilarious comedy starring many big actors, the talented veteran, Kevin Spacey, steals the show all the way through. His character is wacky and mean but yet likable because of his brilliant performance playing the most horrible boss in the movie. In real life, you wouldn't like your boss to be like him but in reel life, the more horrible, the better. The three frustrated men with 'horrible bosses' team up together to rid themselves of their miseries. Jason Sudeikis' character, Kurt, is probably the most convinced of the three that he needs to change his work situation as he has to start dealing with his boss' son who is a coke addict and is out to run down the company and suck every penny that it's worth for his own gain. Jason Batman who has the worst boss played by Kevin Spacey needs a bit more convincing to join the gang. Charlie Day in his character as Dale, starts off being an innocent, fearful man but circumstances lead him to become an angry, foul mouthed man who ends up getting ""high"" on coke and gains this insurmountable energy to take revenge on his boss. Although he has created many comical moments in the film, he somewhat over-does the 'fast-talking, coked up' character that he transforms himself into toward the end. The vengeance combined with suspense and humor makes this movie worth a watch. Dale's boss, Julia, played by Jennifer Aniston is a dentist who is out to ""eat"" every man she comes in contact with. The make-up artist has done a good job complimenting her sexually aggressive nature with those attractive looks. She isn't trying to make you laugh through her jokes but rather through her aggressive, overtly sexual character. Two noteworthy and hilarious performances are given by Jamie Fox and Collin Farrell. Jamie plays the character of 'MF#%$&&"" with huge tattoos around his body pretending to be a high rolling gangster to make a few extra bucks when he is merely a movie pirate in reality. Collin has brilliantly disguised himself in the character of Bobby Pellit, the new boss of Kurt after his father's death. You don't realize it's him until you see the credits at the end. Overall, this comedy is sure to entertain you and give you a bang for your buck!",Horrible Bosses

The premise is very interesting because people can relate to a bad or horrible boss but the execution is typical by the script with no redeeming insight. Basically some of the situations the characters find themselves in with their bosses is downright abuse and very cringe worthy rather then being funny. sure there are nightmare bosses out there but this film takes it to extremes. They are trying to hard to be funny in this movie and the jokes ends up being forced rather then flowing with the story.

I find it difficult to impossible to say which actor is ""best"" only because so many of them are extremely good.

330,zachornsey,Horrible Bosses Is Easily The Best Comedy Of The Year!,9,8 July 2011,"There have already been two major comedy releases this summer, in the form of The Hangover Part 2 and Bridesmaids, but Horrible Bosses puts both of those to shame. With ease.Director Seth Gordon (The King of Kong) has put together an absolutely fantastic dark comedy, full of hilarious dialog, raunchy humor, and an exceptionally strong cast. The real treat of the film, much like 2009's The Hangover, is the in the execution. So many aspects of the film come together in just the right way, with exceptional comedic timing, that you simply can't help but to enjoy the ride.Horrible Bosses stars Jason Bateman, Charlie Day, and Jason Sudeikis as three good friends who all have the same problem: they hate their bosses. Albeit for different reasons, of course. Bateman's boss, Dave Harken (Kevin Spacey), is an egotistical jerk. Day's boss, Julia Harris (Jennifer Anniston), is a sex-craved maniac, while Sudeikis' new boss, Bobby Pellitt (Colin Farrell) is a coke head. The film gives the audience plenty of good reasons to hate these bosses, which helps to relate to the friends' idea of murdering them.What starts out as an off-joke one night between friends blossoms into something more dark and sinister than one would think, with the three friends actually going out of their way to dispose of one another's bosses. They can't handle their work environment, and the film's script gives very good reasons as to why switching jobs really isn't an option. This is key in relating to and believing in the script.Despite what the trailers may lead you to believe, most of the time within the film really isn't spent establishing the murders. Instead, the jokes are found within the concept, giving the three actors plenty of time to entertain you. You're not watching three men plot to murder their bosses; you're watching three men ponder the plot of how to murder their bosses. There's a fine distinction here, and the script does a great job of establishing the difference.Seth Gordon does a fantastic job directing here, adding a layer of intensity to the dark subject matter. The script is nearly perfect, offering the right amount of dark and crude humor with a great amount of solid, unforgettable laughs.Outside of those two concepts, Horrible Bosses really shines in two great ways. The three stars of the film, Bateman, Day, and Sudeikis, have fantastic chemistry here. The three play off of one another in such a manner that you can't help but laugh. Each is bringing a drastically different character to life (though arguably Bateman is still playing the same man he plays in every movie), and their interactions are key to the audience enjoying the film. The group truly works well together, much like a great ensemble should, and we only hope a sequel is quickly green-lit.The other amazing component of the film is the supporting cast, which couldn't be more perfect. Spacey is clearly enjoying his dark, disturbing role as an office jerk, spending much of the film steam-rolling anyone who gets in his way. Every so often you can even catch a slight hint in Spacey's eyes that he's enjoying himself. Maybe a little too much.Colin Farrell completely disappears into the role of Bobby. His despicable manners and attitude toward other human beings is absolutely hilarious. He's nearly unrecognizable in the part, and it's fantastic to see a role where Farrell is out of his comfort zone.And last, but not least, is Jennifer Anniston's Julia Harris, the sexually harassing, foul-mouthed and loathsome creature. She spends much of her time on screen making one sex joke after another, and it's great to see her playing a character completely unique to her past. Horrible Bosses is easily Anniston's best film to date, though that might not be saying much.If you've enjoyed movies like The Hangover or Bridesmaids, you'll love Horrible Bosses. It is simply the best comedy so far this summer, and deserves to be seen in theaters. It's a must-own once it hits retail shelves. Horrible Bosses is one movie not to miss this summer.Our Rating: 4 out of 5 Reels",Horrible Bosses

332,mandywill70,Horrible bosses ho hum,1,13 January 2012,"Why don't I learn from my mistakes? I did the exact same thing with The Hangover. Went with the buzz that the film would be hilarious and was disappointed. Disappointed and bewildered at the people who think this kind of thing is funny. I'm no prude - I loved and laughed raucously at Bridesmaids, Knocked Up and 40 year old Virgin for instance. I cross the line regularly with my own sense of humour and love doses of crude, rude and black with my comedy....if it's FUNNY! If it's lame (which this film is) it's just, well, lame. And offensive.I got this out on video and just sat there with a 'ho hum' expression all the way through. I did not laugh once (begs the question, why did I sit through the thing? I can't tell you!) It was so predictable. For instance, I knew the Kurt character was going to end up having a tryst with Jennifer's character as soon as it was apparent he was a 'ladies man' (for want of a better word) with that stupid vagina line in the bar. As for James Fox's M**F*** character. Haha! They call him M**F** all the time but that's his real his name! Get it! Yaaawwwn. Ho hum.And who is Charlie Day. Oh my God, his voice is annoying.I can also put up with the silly unrealistic scenarios - again, only if they are FUNNY. If the film is lame - they just become stupid unrealistic scenarios which I can't help but pick apart. I.e. - all three bosses would have never got away with their behaviour. I know that's obvious but the inane humour just drew attention to the unbelievability factor for me.Definitely a 1/10 from me.",Horrible Bosses
333,BenMello18,Horrible Bosses is funny but could have been MUCH better,5,9 July 2011,"The first 1/3 of this movie was amazing. The premise was clever, and nothing was overdone. The acting was great and the delivery was near perfect. The characters were great as were the writing and while not completely original the film still drove the plot in a unique way.However the movie's greatest flaw is that it becomes too goofy and unbelievable.A movie about killing your bosses already requires you to suspend your disbelief, however it is much more funny when done SOMEWHAT believable and realistic. The characters become overly dumb, do too many over the top crazy things and scenes turn out so unrealistic and goofy that it is just not as funny anymore.It was funnier when it was more subtle and believable. It almost feels as if the writers got lazy as the transition occurs over the course of just one scene and the movie then takes a dive from there.One example is the character harassed by his boss, Jennifer Aniston. He was done very well in the beginning but by the end is so over the top that his voiceonly serves as an annoyance. The movie takes a plunge from clever and creative jokes to screaming and ridiculous scenes with more cursing showing what felt like a desperation to get a laugh.Jamie Foxx's character was uninteresting, and Jason Bateman's new boss gave a horrible bland performance as if it was his first time acting and he wasn't even trying, but those were the only bad performances in the movie. Kevin Spacey was brilliant as we're the bosses and leads. More screen time for Colin Farrell's character would have been welcome. Almost everyone gives a good performance in this movie.Even after the first 1/3 when the movie took a turn for the worst it still manages to be clever and get some laughs throughout the rest of the film, showing this movie had more promise if better writing was present. However it was nowhere near as good as the beginning 1/3.Horrible Bosses WILL make you laugh, however the over the top writing and acting hurts it greatly and what could have been a great classic comedy is now just another average flick.First 1/3 of the movie gets a 9 out of 10.Latter 2/3 of the film gets a 5 out of 10.Overall score of 6 out of 10.",Horrible Bosses

She totally kills it as the super hot, sexually harassing boss of Charlie Day's character. Also hysterical, as always, is Jamie Foxx. Amazing, all star cast nails it all around.MUST WATCH!",Horrible Bosses
335,Ar23035,A fun time at the movies,8,19 July 2011,"""Horrible Bosses"" probably won't be nominated for any Oscars, but it is definitely a fun movie for a night out. I actually saw it twice--once on a date and once for a friend's birthday--and I didn't mind paying to see it twice at all. Was it silly and crude? Yes. Were there a few plot holes? Yes. But it's so funny that you won't even care. The trio of Jason Bateman, Jason Sudeikus, and Charlie Day is comedic gold. The ""horrible bosses"" are all excellent and deliciously, hilariously evil, played by Jennifer Aniston, Kevin Spacey, and Colin Farrell. Jamie Foxx has a particularly funny and memorable supporting role. It reminded me a little bit of ""Office Space"", but the premise was fresh and imaginative, and the movie avoided being too clichéd. Overall, a creative concept + great comedic talent=hilarious movie. Go see it if you are a fan of comedy, particularly of the R-rated, Apatow-like kind.",Horrible Bosses

337,warriors_fan,Definitely worth a watch,7,3 August 2011,"A plot that many can relate to. Having the worst boss in the world. That's the problem 3 best friends Kurt, Nick and Dale have. How do you solve this problem? Well obviously you conspire to kill each others bosses. That's the premise behind the black comedy Horrible Bosses.This movie will not have you rolling around the aisles in fits of laughter but there is enough genuinely funny moments to make you feel you got bang for your buck.There is an all star cast including Kevin Spacey and bit parts from Colin Farrell and Jamie Fox. Jennifer Aniston also steps right out of her comfort zone playing the almost sexual predator type Dr Julia Harris.As I say it is not the funniest movie I have ever seen but it gets a solid 7 out of 10 and is recommended for a bit of light hearted relief",Horrible Bosses
338,rockthearts-against,Very Funny! Don't watch with relatives!!!,7,17 October 2011,"A hilarious comedy about three men who (like most people) hate their bosses. Easy enough to relate to and entertaining to watch. be warned: this is not a family Friday night movie, your in for some crude humor and tense awkward glances. Jenifer Aniston was particularly funny considering i'm used to her in her usual 'good girl' roles. I love movies that make movie references and that certainly made me happy here. The only thing that disappointed me was the excessive use of raw language, at some points I just felt it was unnecessary but other than that it is a solid funny movie. Great laughs for hours! All in all its a great movie, worth money in the theater or a few bucks for a CD, definitely something to watch over and over and over again.",Horrible Bosses
339,TheAlbinoRhino,A Comedy to Remember,7,2 October 2011,"I'll be honest - when I first got into watching this movie, I wasn't expecting to like it this much. I was expecting it to be a typical ""We hate our bosses"" movie that attempts to appeal to the working-class American. I was blatantly wrong; this is so much more.The three protagonists aren't exactly the most memorable characters, with the exception of Charlie Day's character, Dale. The other two are fairly normal men, except with opposite personalities. One is a womanizer; the other is a normal hard worker and overachiever. Dale is sort of in the middle of them. He's a sensible guy who loves his fiancé, though he's also crazy as hell (yes, I did just say he's sensible, but crazy). Dale will most likely be the character that you get the most kicks out of. Day is a fantastic actor who always does seem to stick out in whatever role he plays, and I think he was absolutely perfect for the character of Dale. The antagonists are the real characters you'll remember. You will get a genuine feeling of hatred for these horrible bosses, I guarantee it. You'll even feel hatred for Jennifer Aniston's character, which is constantly trying to seduce Dale (I thought that was impossible until I saw the total ""B-word moves"" she pulls). Needless to say, the acting is great and the characters were pulled off pretty well.The movie starts out as the three main characters are jokingly considering murdering their bosses, and it soon ensues into them going into MUCH more than they were expecting, and even more than I was expecting. You honestly will not see much of the twists in the movie coming. As a comedy writer, one of the best tips that I've been given is that the best comedy can be anything that's unexpected. This film is exactly that. I cannot recommend it enough for people wanting a good, enjoyable comedy flick.",Horrible Bosses
340,SylvainSivori,"More or less a series of sketches built into an unbelievable storyline, funny enough though.",7,10 October 2011,"Horrible Bosses(2011) The next big comedy coming out of Hollywood. The story is as simple as absurd and this works well within the genre. It creates great situational comedy, the main characters are simply victims of the script and because of coincidence and stupidity find themselves in some hilarious situations. Three friends with something in common, their bosses are evil monsters. They have to die, and deserve it.Jason Bateman plays Nick, he doesn't really agree with killing the bosses but is dragged along anyway. He seems a bit cold and distant, hard for the audience to really connect. There isn't any background on his family life. He spent eight years kissing his boss' ass, not the best quality in a human being. Charlie Day plays Dale. He basically recreates his character from 'It's Always Sunny in Philidelphia', which is a neurotic, fast talking, hyped up guy. He is devoted to his fiancée but has to cope with the sexual advances of his boss. Jason Sudeikis plays Kurt, a confusing character. In the beginning of the movie we see him as a typical nice guy who is friendly with his buddy, the boss (he dies, after which his horrible son takes over the company), cares about the environment and co-workers. During the course of the movie he changes into a rather unbelievable womanizer who picks up women sweettalking them with lines like 'you have to be a model'. Not the best pickup line but hey, when so attractive as Sudeikis it's easy right? They are convincing as friends though and play off each other very well. The real strength of the movie however lies in the supporting cast. The bosses are all greatly done. Kevin Spacey plays the role he is made for (remeniscent of his character in Swimming with Sharks). An egocentric, narcissistic, self centered, manipulative asshole. He seems to be really enjoying himself here, top class. Colin Farrel is very funny as the egocentric kung-fu minded, coke-head who cares about nothing but his desire to party. A bit of a shame he didn't get much screen time. His funniest bit was in the closing credits, a missed opportunity. Jennifer Aniston is considered to be an American Sweetheart, I believe. Here she plays the complete opposite. A sex crazed single hot dentist who goes the distance to get Charlie Days character to have sex with her. She says the exact things that you wouldn't expect from 'the sweet princess', it works well. Jamie Foxx as the murder adviser is a flat black gangster parody at first. It turns out he tricks the three friends in a good way. The 'most likely to succeed guy', who first was a broker at Lehman Brothers who had it made, fell down so low that he'd perform hand-jobs for a couple of bucks is absurd and very funny. The twists in the story are nothing special and the ending is a bit forced, the story relies on coincidence. The strength lies in absurd situations which will almost never occur in real life. It's more or less a series of sketches built into an unbelievable storyline, funny enough though. 7/10",Horrible Bosses

Most pseudo comic lines of the script can only pretend to be humorous to a kind of parasitic cynic and close to demonic minds that relish in deception, a twisted adulation of vulgar language for no other reason than the kick of it, childish pee pee poop humor, yet at the same time arrogantly trying to subjugate the viewer with an illusory sense of moral. This is trash of the lowest level and watching this raise concern about the kind of society this kind of movie is trying to foster. Incipiently, it appears this may be the work of Jewish writers.

344,jwhittier16,Horrible Bosses Review,8,17 October 2013,"The movie Horrible Bosses is a hilarious comedy, which came out in 2011. The movie is full of stars, including Jason Bateman, Kevin Spacey, Charlie Day, Jennifer Aniston, and Jason Sudeikis. The film was set in Glendale, California, and in current times. The movie starts with Nick Hendricks (Jason Bateman) getting to work a minute late, and getting called out by his boss (Kevin Spacey) for it. Kurt (Jason Sudeikis) loved his job until his boss died, and the business was taken over by his boss's coked-out son. Dale (Charlie Day) hates his job for the oddest of reasons; his extremely attractive boss continually makes unwanted sexual gestures towards him. The three men get together and all complain about their situations, but none of the men can quit because of the current economic times, and for Dale a spot on the sex offender list. The three, under the influence of a few drinks decide to kill each other's bosses to solve the problem, and in no time have a murder consultant hired. These three inexperienced killers attempt to go through with their three hits, and this entertaining comedy goes through many twists and turns to reach an ending that no one expected.The acting in this movie was simply amazing. Each star, and supporting member played his or her roles flawlessly. Jason Bateman is a prime example of this. He was able to stay serious, but still come off to the audience as hilarious. This is exemplified later in the movie during his explanation of the red light he ran to the police.Another great aspect of this movie was the setting. Glendale is a beautiful city, and encompassed all the aspects the film needed. The downtown was perfect for Nick's job, while the luxurious suburbs were great for both his boss, and Dale's boss. The city also possessed a lower class neighborhood, perfect for the murder consultant. The camera work in this movie was also great. There was angle shots to show the bosses power over Nick, Dale, and Kurt, as well as many close ups to show emotion.If you want a movie that keeps you laughing the entire hour and 40 minutes then Horrible Bosses is for you. The movie is unpredictable, the acting is great, and the setting is perfect. I would recommend this movie to any comedy fan.",Horrible Bosses

Colin Farrell does a superb job acting as a spoiled son of the owner, while Aniston is brilliant acting as a horny sexpot. A fantastic cast of actors that really know how to make you laugh through the little things not written in-script make this film, in my opinion, one of the funniest movies of the year. By placing these actors in a series of ridiculous and insane setups can really make you laugh. I do not regularly go to the movie theaters to watch films, but with this cast and comic story line, is was convinced, and i don't regret it.",Horrible Bosses
347,onlycyou,A Great Movie Introduces Me 3 Talented Actors,10,20 August 2019,"I am so glad that I have seen this movie. Horrible Bosses opens a door for me to see three different talented actors in the show. First, Jason Bateman, who is absolutely brilliant and funny, can easily make audience to laugh without make much effort. Everything I see in him can be described as nature. He is born nature to play in comedy movies. Different from other comedy actors, he can perform hysterical funny scenes with very serious faces. Moreover, after watched his performance at TV Shows Ozark, I am confident to say that Jason Bateman can do perfect in comedy movies, and he also is able to kill for other dramas. He is a true actor. Second, Jason Sudeikis, who is also an gifted comedy actor, is fulfilled with funny cells/blood all in his body. One of the flash points I seen in him is that audience can find him funny not only through his word, but body language. I can not be serious with this guy because I feel there must be some happy field around him all the time. Last but not least,Kevin Spacey, who is naturally born with bossy attitude, perfectly played his role, and I think people find his charm through different roles he can build in different movies, and always leave rooms for audience to discuss how impressive he did in the shows. Most importantly he has the ability to make everyone who has seen his performance remember him as one of the most favorite actors at all time.",Horrible Bosses
348,woitek,"bad, bad film",2,5 September 2011,"For me and my girlfriend it was very painful to watch. Also there were some 20 other people in the cinema and I heard maybe 3 faint laughters..Most of the time I was under the impression that I'm watching one of those 1-minute chaotic totally-improvised self-made movies on youtube, only one that is 100 times longer and thus way beyond being bearable.There were only a few genuine jokes, and Charlie Day's monologues, while probably meant to be funny, were annoying enough to me wanting to fast-forward. Many one-worder lines, again, often found as comments under youtube movies, made it a really bad movie.I guess it was a favour to the makers of this movie on the well-known-named actor's part to take part in it, but sadly, I couldn't stop thinking that the movie would be MUCH better with only their short appearances in it. Kevin Spacey's acting was sharp, to the point, amusing. There was too little of Collin Farrel's character, and Jennifer Anniston's character was definitely under-scripted. It was bad the way it was delivered, I guess it could have been much better.I may have seen worse movies, but then again, this one was advertised so much, that it deserves an even lower grade.",Horrible Bosses

350,sugaryspice14,Entertaining and funny... definitely worth a watch,8,23 July 2011,"While the storyline appears to be fairly conventional at first, this witty comedy surprises the audience with clever twists and a humorous outcome. The basic plot revolves around three old friends, Nick, Kurt and Dale (Jason Bateman, Jason Sudeikis, Charlie Day), who meet on a regular basis to complain about how evil and twisted each of their bosses are (Kevin Spacey, Colin Farrell, Jennifer Aniston). On a particularly bad day, the idea of doing away with their bosses is so appealing that they begin plotting to have their bosses killed. This leads to several entertaining and funny situations as they realise just how complicated the task is, and consider whether they are actually capable of murder.The three main actors do a good job of convincing the audience just how much they hate their bosses. They had great chemistry on screen, making their characters quite likable, and the story all the more funnier. The three high-profile actors that play their bosses don't disappoint either. Jennifer Aniston is particularly good in a role that is very different from her usual comedy, and Kevin Spacey was the perfect choice for the worst of the three bosses. The story was well structured with some sharp comedy that's a refreshing change from the usual toilet humour coming out of Hollywood. It is well complimented by good directing and original score.Overall, Horrible bosses is definitely one of the funnier comedies of the year, and is an entertaining and enjoyable watch.",Horrible Bosses

Even their Bosses are also adorable in their roles and steal the show in their short roles. I especially liked the performance of Colin Farrell , Charlie Day and Jennifer Aniston.

Althoug the bosses are okay, the heroes are completely losers and you cannot have any sympathy for them. If Jennifer Anniston is harassing her assistant you think: 'Good for you, Dumbo'. The movie is dualistic: the bosses are horrible but the 'heroes' aren't that much better.There isn't any climax in the movie, it just ends at some point. I think I will soon forget this movie.

I was disgustingly disappointed.The movie is full of stereotypes, and they are all extremely exaggerated - but that's not why this movie is a complete waste of time. It is because the characters are also written to be complete morons: they do and say things that no real person would ever say or do. They are unbelievable to say the least. It's pointless as a movie. It could have been a 10 min SNL sketch - that would have been fine. But not a full length movie. The only thing good about the movie was that Steve Wiebe had a small role. Seth Gordon should stick to documentaries - because at least then he can find some real people.It made me feel disgusted and annoyed, and if you have half a brain you'll pick another movie.

You've got Jason Bateman (Arrested Development), Charlie Day (It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia) and Jason Sudeikis (Saturday Night Live) giving prime performances that's either comparative or even surpassed by the great supporting cast Kevin Spacey (American Beauty), Jennifer Aniston (Office Space) and an almost unrecognizable Colin Farrell (In Bruges).It's not just the great acting that makes the movie. The writing is genuinely inventive (a rare find in mainstream Hollywood) and hilariously constructed to keep the audience laughing. The direction by (hopefully) up and coming Seth Gordon is nothing short of greatness and the cinematography is excellent (especially in the night shots).If you're looking for a true comedy that doesn't fall short on laughs and even action that most comedies fall short on go see Horrible Bosses.",Horrible Bosses
355,Tulan,Great cast makes a good comedy,10,14 September 2011,"At first, this movie caught my interest when I've seen pictures of Kevin Spacey, Jennifer Aniston and Colin Farrel (or in other words: the upper side of the poster). After seeing the movie, I am confident to say they each nailed their part. Spacey hasn't been this great in years (although I loved him in The Men Who Stare at Goats). Farell doesn't have that much screen time but it's good to see him in a different kind of role. His last movie I had seen was Fright Night - 180 degrees from that part for sure. And for Jennifer Aniston, whom I adored in Friends, couldn't watch her in any of her movies. Until this one. She's sexy, she's funny, she finally makes a good character outside Rachel Green.And the other reasons why the casting is good is the ""lower side of the poster"": Jason Bateman, Charlie Day & Jason Sudekis. Until this movie I only knew Jason Bateman but even so, they are the less famous trio. But during the course of the movie, I could separate the fact who is famous, who is not, which actor I knew for years or which one I see for the first time. So both trios, the ""Bosses"" and ""Employees"" were great. Jamie Foxx was good too, and I'm happy Donald Sutherland was also in this.The script and the directing were also good, although I expected a little more dark humor and I thought all the ""bosses"" would cross each other's path (Harken said he would go to the dentist next week but that line led to nowhere) which didn't happen.All in all, I had a really good time. Not a perfect comedy but the best one of the year - at least, according to my taste.",Horrible Bosses
356,danjama,'Horrible Bosses' is the best comedy in recent memory.,8,23 July 2011,"FINALLY, a new film worth writing about. 'Hangover', get the hell out of here, 'Horrible Bosses' just owned you. All I will say about 'Hangover 2' here, is that it is DULL in comparison to this film. And you have to compare them, because they have the same basic concept - a trio of friends with a hard-to-reach, against all odds goal. Moving on...Credit to the writers - Michael Markowitz, John F. Daley and Jonathon Goldstein, clever, tightly written comedy, with more unusual and risky jokes than we're used to seeing (Colin Farrell mocking a man in a wheelchair - brilliant). I applaud you.Anything with Kevin Spacey is always worth a watch. He is one of the most creditable and successful actors in the world. From the first trailer, I knew I had to see it. I had a small doubt when I saw Jen Aniston, but...i'll admit it, she surprised me here. Looking sexier than ever, she played the part of the fiendishly, criminally dirty boss perfectly. She has found her new role in movies. It was great to see her doing something different, and more grown up, finally moving away from her innocent Friends era. It's been a long time coming. It was great to see talented and sometimes unexpected actors in smaller roles - Lindsay Sloane, for example, who I first remember in my memory as a friend of Sabrina the teenage witch, but has been popping up in many places recently (at least, more prolific places than 5-10 years ago).The characters were what made this film stand out, and the actors all brought the characters to life. There was a genuine and natural chemistry that came across on the screen, and it made the characters distinctive and believable, even in their ridiculous venture. With other actors, the oral comedy could quickly become boring, cliché and redundant, but the performances from Jason Bateman, Charlie Day, Jason Sudeikis and the rest of the cast all stand out from anything in recent memory. For me, Charlie Day requires a special mention; Many moments of comedy came from his quick and unhinged tongue. A small thing I really liked about this film is the few references to popular culture - very cleverly done; as a taster, there is a certain cut-scene which involved 'The Notebook' on a netbook and some teary eyes in the audience, and a stylish and subtle reference to 'The Great Gatsby' which goes almost unnoticed - there's also a fantastic, naturally edited scene between the three friends and Motherfu.r Jones (Jamie Foxx) where they discuss the intricacies of a film that they may or may not have seen in relation to their predicament. Really nicely done.The story itself is a dark comedy about three friends who decide to kill their bosses. The story beginning is textbook perfect, as we're introduced to each case individually (each situation brilliantly set-up and introduced), and then we are the fourth man at a table with the three of them, as they discuss the ins and outs of their working lives. One thing leads to another, and sooner or later we're seeing and hearing about rape, murder, assisted homocide, sexual harassment, loose fillings, blackmail and all that great stuff that I love. It's just great to see a comedy that has low moral standards (as low as mine).It's eventually wrapped up very cleverly and unexpectedly, just as you begin to think there is no end in sight (not that you're bored, but you're sort of expecting it and then it doesn't come). I won't spoil it.The credits were great; fresh sounding soundtrack and it's always nice to have outtakes, to connect you more with the actors and the process, and then slowly bring you out of the movie 'disbelief' zone. As the final outtake broke into the black screen with the SUPER 'Horrible Bosses', I was still laughing and smiling. The film is a credit to all involved, and will not be forgotten for a long time.I just hope they don't bring out a 'Horrible Bosses 2'.",Horrible Bosses

Sudeikis, Day, and Bateman delivered performances typical to them. Anniston's character was probably one of the most different than usual. Awesome character and performance. Spacey and Farrel did a pretty good job, and Fox was pretty damn funny. But Charlie Day and Jason Sudeikis were probably the shining stars here. The plot wasn't surprising or out of the ordinary, but the story was great. The ending wasn't a surprise, but the comedy was non stop, so the movie was really enjoyable.

The character of Dale was massively overplayed by Charlie Day. Fans of It's Always Sunny In Philadelphia will see that he was pretty much playing playing his character from that show.

Wanted to kill Kevin Spacey's character....guess he did a good job. The rest of the characters did not engage me, nor did the major holes in the ""plot.""

363,ariadiva13,Hilarity ensues...,10,9 July 2011,"...when three men head out on a mission to do something most of us only dare dream of. A series of circumstances brought about through a combination of incompetence and blind luck concludes in a finale that you have to see to believe and makes this film a true winner. Jason Bateman, Jason Sudeikis, and Charlie Day decide to rid themselves of the most insane bosses ever to walk the earth. With Kevin Spacey, Colin Farrell, and Jennifer Aniston in the roles of these world-class psychopathic managers, nothing could make this movie much better except having Jamie Foxx in small, but crucial supporting role.Bateman, Sudeikis, and Day bring decidedly different acting styles and personalities that merge into a holy trinity of comedic suspense. If you aren't falling off your seat laughing, you will be on the edge of it until the very end. Definitely stay in it for the gag reel during the credits which puts a tremendously funny cherry on top of this wonderfully satisfying darkly comedic sundae.Warning: This film is rated ""R"" for a reason - foul language, gratuitous sexuality, and violence play a large role and some viewers may find it offensive.",Horrible Bosses

365,JackMayhauf,Not as funny as I thought,6,12 July 2011,"Last night I saw Horrible Bosses. I heard that it was supposedly funnier then the Hangover and Superbad. So I had some high expectations and really it didn't live up to the hype. It was funny with some good laughs but overall seemed sort of drawn out. There was no real purpose to the movie, it was like someone came up with the idea while sitting at work and thinking ""Man wouldn't it be awesome if I could kill my boss"" The casting was good, took some break out comedians in Jason Sudeikis and Charlie Day and paired them with a solid veteran in Jason Bateman. The bosses themselves really weren't my favourite. Colin Farrell definitely wouldn't have been my first choice to play Bobby Pellit and Kevin Spacey just doesn't go well with comedies. The best part was seeing Jennifer Aniston's smoking hot body and the really odd sexually related things she does to Charlie Day. I really can't believe she's over 40 that's just unfair. The whole part with Jamie Foxx just seemed unneeded cause he really didn't do anything to help the plot move forward. He basically just wasted time. For some reason I always find that whenever there are cops in a movie they are either really smart or just plain dumb-asses. And you can guess how they are in this one. It's one of those movies where I thought preview was funnier then the actual movie and at the same time it basically tells you the entire plot anyways.I know I might be being over critical but I thought everything just worked out too smoothly for the guys. They literally break into Kevin's house by finding a key inside a fake rock and of course there's no alarm system. Same with Colin's house, how wouldn't you notice people run into your garage as you drive away. When Charlie Day repeatedly stabs Kevin in the chest with an epipen the movie just became too over the top, especially after the tenth stab I think he would be dead. Also I didn't really understand why Jason Sudeikis's character was such a player it didn't suit him at all. I'm sure after stalking a woman for hours outside her house she's just going to invite you in for a quickie or even better in a closet at her husband's birthday party. Overall it was an alright comedy but not even close to being on par with any Judd Apatow comedies. I wouldn't be rushing to theatres to see this one; it's more of a renter like most of Jason Bateman's movies. I'd give it 2 out of 5 stars at best. If you're thinking of seeing Horrible Bosses I'd say see Bridesmaids first if you haven't yet.",Horrible Bosses

Why would Kevin Spacey act in a movie like this?! Charlie and Michael Bluth were type casted - looks like they found their winning potions and as for the third main character, he probably has a bunch of std's by now!

They decided that there lives would be much easier if their bosses were dead so they enlist the help of motherf***** Jones( jamie fox)And from there hilarity ensue. Bateman is great as the straight man while sudekis and day have all the fun but are great at it. Now for the villains, spacey was great as usual while Farrel was barley recognizable as the coke addicted boss of sudekis, but aniston was probably the most fun to watch as the dentist who harasses day and she is great at it her alone is the reason the movie is rated R.

I can not believe an actor like Kevin Spacey accepted this script. Really disappointed.It starts of alright, but gets worse as the movie progresses.

370,benigthed40,Childish Humor for the Immature Adult Simpleton,2,6 August 2011,"What makes something 'funny' is the focal point of comedic philosophy. Do you enjoy racial humor? Sexual innuendos? Poop-jokes? Silly curse words? Sardonic Family Guy-like, non-linear one liners? Lots of things can be funny. But all jokes are not created equal. There is nothing worse than watching an unfunny comedy; something strangely unsettling about staring at a 90 foot screen, just praying for the movie to end and knowing in the back of your mind that you will never get this time back. Why did I not just walk out? Because it was 105 degrees outside and there was a nice air conditioner. Seriously. That's why I didn't leave. I will not say that I did not laugh at all, because that is untrue. There were a few times I made audible chuckles, mostly because of Charlie Day, but 3 laughs in 2 hours is not worth a $7.50 matinée. There were a surprising number of cameos, like from Ron White, that dude who plays Bunk from The Wire, and several other easily forgettable performances by famous people I typically like in films. But just because I like peanut butter, and mayonnaise, and pickles, and feta cheese, and oysters, and raw Kobe beef, and orange sorbet does not mean that I'll add all of them in a bowl, mix em up, and hope something good comes out of it. Charlie Day was alright. Kevin Spacey was unforgettable. Jason Bateman was just bad. Jason Sudeikis was the worst. Jennifer Aniston was hot. So, why was this movie so bad? Comedy is a complex art form. Not everyone can be funny all the time. They can't all be winners. Not all Led Zeppelin albums rock the same. This is a case where seasoned actors and proved writers combine in a cacophony of crap and the result is remarkably unfunny. 2 stars (for Charlie).",Horrible Bosses

The cast is reason alone to go see it. Jennifer Aniston was really funny in it, however there wasn't much explanation as to WHY her character was doing the things she was doing and why she was the way she was. The other two horrible bosses (Spacey and Farrel) had clearer motives to their bad behavior. Nonetheless, Aniston was better in this movie than in a lot of her other roles. Kevin Spacey and Colin Farrrell were absolutely stellar, and Jason Bateman was amazing. I liked Charlie Day's character, however it was a little too similar to his character in ""It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia."" He's a young actor though and not as seasoned as the others - he will eventually find his stride in developing characters different than what he's already done.Plot was pretty solid, with enough twists that were actually feasible in real life. Soundtrack wasn't anything to write home about. Cinematography was pretty standard. I think they could have done more with the camera zooms, angles, lenses, etc to make the flick more visually interesting. The out-takes and extra scenes through the credits were also very funny.

What better way than to see a movie that displays most people's fantasy, which is murdering their boss. I thought the cast was excellent. I feel Kevin Spacey played the perfect slave-driving-high-school-bully-type character perfectly. I also loved Jennifer Aniston portraying portraying the horny, slutty, hot dentist. But my favorite of the three villains was definitely Colin Farrell. He was, without a doubt, the funniest character in the whole movie and I loved how he tried to ""trim the fat.""I also believe the three protagonists (Jason Bateman, Jason Sudeikis, and Charlie Day) were perfect for their selected roles and each one complimented the other two. I also love how in the beginning of the movie, Charlie Day was seen as the idiot character while the other two were much smarter. Then later on, he proves himself to be an invaluable member of the group by getting them off the hook with the police temporarily only for Jason Sudeikis (who was also hilarious btw) to remember he stuck his boss's toothbrush up his ass leaving DNA behind. Oh, and how can I forget Motherf*cker Jones (Jamie Foxx)? You thought Mr. Chow from The Hangover films was crazy? He was nothing compared to Motherf*cker Jones. This guy literally charged the three guys $5,000 to be their ""murder consultant"" only for them to find out all he's ever done to get into trouble was video piracy.Overall, this was a great dark comedy with an ensemble cast and in my opinion, the best comedy film of 2011. It sure beats the likes of Take Me Home Tonight, Arthur, Hall Pass, and The Hangover Part II. If you enjoy watching a dark concept being acted out in the most outrageous ways, you should definitely see this movie.10/10",Horrible Bosses

381,ghehsv98,Not that good a movie either,3,1 June 2014,"After reading the other IMDb reviews for ""Horrible Bosses"" I have to wonder if many of the reviewers and I saw the same movie. ""Horrible Bosses"" is almost totally dependent on the ""idiot plot"" (usually defined as ""a plot which is kept in motion solely by virtue of the fact that everybody involved is an idiot"".) I understand how logic in comedy is often allowed to be ""loose,"" but the three abused employees, Nick, Dale, and Kurt (played respectively by Jason Bateman, Charlie Day, and Jason Sudeikis) come across as being way too dumb and fearful to even dream of carrying out a successful murder plot.Not that the three bosses aren't deserving. Dave Harken (played by Kevin Spacey) is an arrogant sociopath who delights in tormenting his employees, particularly Nick; dentist Julia Harris (played by Jennifer Aniston) apparently wants sex with Dale, her assistant, more to dominate Dale than for any attraction; Bobby Pellitt (played by an almost unrecognizable Colin Farrell) is a wastrel coke-head who makes no secret of intending to loot the assets of his recently deceased father's business so he can live ""the good life,"" oblivious of any ramifications on others. Farrell's character is relatively minor, only appearing briefly in two scenes before being murdered (not by Nick, Dale, and Kurt.)The movie has it's amusing moments and was well acted, but overall it is a disappointment. A good concept for a film that apparently the writers and director didn't quite know which direction to take.",Horrible Bosses
