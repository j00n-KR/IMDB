0,MartinHafer,I can't believe I actually saw this stinker in the theater!,2,1 June 2006,"Okay, as I say above I can't believe I actually saw this in the theaters, but at least I didn't PAY to see it! This movie managed to be WORSE than Roger Moore's other terrible James Bond film, MOONRAKER and that is no small accomplishment! And why is it so bad? Well, there are many reasons--acting, script and casting decisions that were just hair-brained to say the least.First, Roger Moore just looks so old and tired in this film. It's actually embarrassing to have him play the young Lothario as he sleeps with women who are young enough to be his daughter,...or maybe even granddaughter! And, it's really hard to believe that he was able to beat up much of anyone in the film as well--except perhaps when he was able to physically able to overpower a 100-pound Grace Jones. It seems that due to his age, this film makes his opponents less demanding! Second, Grace Jones, Tanya Roberts and Christopher Walken are probably three of the top five worst James Bond supporting actors. Grace Jones seems to think she is acting in CONAN THE DESTROYER and her acting range is ultra-limited to say the least. Tanya Roberts is incredibly sexy,...until she opens her mouth. She doesn't so much SPEAK her dialog but SQUEAKS it! And, she just sounds rather addle-brained. So, it seems that apart from nooky, she has little to offer Bond. And as for Christopher Walken, he plays much the same character he plays in many other films--a nutty guy who seems too loony to be much of a threat.Third, the film is dull and that's the biggest problem overall.If you want to watch another Bond film that MIGHT be worse, try watching Sean Connery's NEVER SAY NEVER AGAIN. Both these films prove that just because you may have been an excellent Bond, there is definitely a time to say enough is enough and retire from the role.",A View to a Kill
1,TheLittleSongbird,One of the weaker Roger Moore Bond movies,4,18 August 2010,"That's not to say it is the worst, I'd say Octopussy is the worst of the Roger Moore Bond movies mainly because it was so careless in the plot. However, despite some good things, this is one of the weaker Roger Moore Bond movies. It looks beautiful though with some fun action, the music is good(with exception of the forgettable theme song), Christopher Walken and Grace Jones make for effective(if not particularly evil) villains and Patrick MacNee fares even better as Bond's right-hand man. However, the story is over-familiar, predictable and contrived, the script lacks the wit and arch of other Bond films, the pacing is very uneven throughout consequently the film lacks that key ingredient-excitement and the direction is lacking. Tanya Roberts is okay with what she has, which isn't much, all it is really is looking sexy, and while Roger Moore is nice and smooth he is truly starting to show his age in this one, no offence. Overall, it is okay but for a Bond film it is rather weak and disappointing. 4/10 Bethany Cox",A View to a Kill
2,bkoganbing,A MicroChip off the Old Block,6,11 October 2009,"For his last outing as 007, Roger Moore gets to save Silicon Valley in California as mad French industrialist Christopher Walken seeks to corner the market on nuke proof microchips. It's funny how it's inevitably British Intelligence that seems always to be saving American bacon.Truth be told my favorite James Bond was getting a little too old to be playing in these action adventure films. Moore was 58 and looking like someone in his Fifties doing all these action stunts. Tanya Roberts joins the exclusive club of women who've been Bondified by some 007. She's the owner of some mining properties which Walken ruthlessly acquires for his nefarious schemes. Also in this cast is Grace Jones who functions oddly enough like Richard Kiel as Jaws in two earlier Bond films. She's certainly as deadly as Kiel and she also finds out as Kiel did just how expendable she ultimately is.Walter Gotell as Russian spymaster General Gogol returns as well in this Bond film. Gotell always provides a note of levity in the Bond films, but never more so when he tells Robert Brown as M as to why he's happy that Walken gets foiled in his plot which we all know James Bond will do in the end.So as Roger Moore rode off in his Astin-Martin car into the sunset we can thank 007 and the rest of the gang at British Intelligence that San Jose, California is not now an underwater city. A View To Kill gets a bit silly at times, but fans of the James Bond series should be happy enough with it.",A View to a Kill
3,Leofwine_draca,"Underfairly maligned Bond film is great fun, in a cheesy '80s way",7,27 November 2016,"A much derided final entry into the Bond canon for ageing star Roger Moore, who decided to quit the role when he realised that the real-life mother of his love interest in the film, Tanya Roberts, was younger than he was! A VIEW TO A KILL comes in for a lot of negative criticism and sometimes, it's easy to see why. It has a smattering of '80s cheese about it, a lot of attempts at humour that fall by the wayside, and an overall lack of seriousness/realism that make the rambling storyline hard to take seriously. Despite all the flaws, I still enjoyed this more than earlier, boring outings like, say, THE MAN WITH THE GOLDEN GUN.Roger Moore may be looking distinctly aged in this one – he was 56 – but nowhere does it say that Bond has to be a young man, so I was more than okay with that. What counts is that he still has his excellent dry delivery for the one-liners, and a twinkle in his eye that shows he knows he's having fun. The storyline may not be one of the best, involving horse racing scams, Nazi doctors, Aryan supermen, and a plot to create a natural disaster, and in the end it all descends into a big action scene, but I thought the film moved along nicely unlike some of the worst-paced ones like THUNDERBALL.There's a good supporting cast, too. Bad guy Christopher Walken was fresh off THE DEAD ZONE and retains his quiet craziness for the role of the psychotic Frenchman; not the most sinister or hateful bad guy of the series, but one of the most irritating. Tanya Roberts is an absolutely stunning Bond girl and probably the best of the '80s actresses that appeared opposite the British spy. Roberts embodies everything that was best about the '80s, and she more than makes up for any deficiencies arising from the miscasting of the (frankly scary) Grace Jones as another Bond girl. Still, the appearance of Jones firmly dates this film in a fun way, perhaps adding a touch of nostalgia for older fans. There are other interest actors here, too: David Yip as a CIA agent, a brief cameo from Dolph Lundgren in his first screen appearance; sinister Belgian Patrick Bauchau and ex-AVENGERS star Patrick Macnee as a posh ally, who is absolutely EXCELLENT in the film, adding a lot of humour to what's going on.Director John Glen did all of the '80s Bond flicks and he knew how to keep the pace going, as well as delivering some decent action. This one has some skiing (bit bored of it, frankly), then some unusual interludes – there's a horse race going out of control, and a car chase on a fire truck that prefigures a similar scene in TERMINATOR 3. It ends on a (literal) high with an airship above the Golden Gate bridge, a scene with great effects and plenty of adventure. So there you have it, not a bad Bond film at all, and the Duran Duran theme only makes it better.",A View to a Kill
4,SnoopyStyle,Roger Moore cheese finally comes to an end,6,20 February 2014,"James Bond (Roger Moore) recovers a microchip from the dead body of 003 in Russia. The chip is capable of withstanding an EMP and an exact copy of a top secret chip created by Zorin Industries. Max Zorin (Christopher Walken) is presumed to be an anti-communist, but he and his henchwoman May Day (Grace Jones) are up to no good. His loyalty is questioned. He's juicing his race horses, and creating an earthquake to wipe out his Silicon Valley competition. And there is the pretty Stacy Sutton (Tanya Roberts).It's getting cheesy with Roger Moore. It's the end of an era and just as well. His schtick is getting old, and quite frankly so is Roger. The writing is lackluster, and the action lacks intensity. It's one of the poorer Bond effort. The character of Stacy Sutton should be more prominent in the first half. The problem with the story is that it starts with a fascinating subject like microchips, but most of the beginning has Bond running around investigating race horses. What does it matter that Zorin is cheating in horse races? It's just an excuse to advance the story, but the first half of the movie is wasted on it.Even the big firetruck chase has its problems. It's more comedy than thrilling. The actors have too many scenes in front of the projection screen while on the firetruck. It's fake, and it shows. Action scenes have moved on. A Bond movie should be better. And a blimp is no evil vehicle. It lacks the power, and is much too flimsy. It just adds to the movie's cheesiness.",A View to a Kill
5,Horst_In_Translation,I liked it for the most part,6,18 June 2020,"""A View to a Kill"" is a British, mostly English-language movie from 1985 ans this makes it the first James Bond movie released during my lifetime, even if I was not even a year old at that point. It runs for approximately 130 minutes and the director was John Glen. He started as an editor, but after working in that department also on Bond got picked to direct several Roger Moore 007 movies and also the two films starring Timothy Dalton. Glen is still alive today at the age of almost 90. Writer Richard Maibaum is not, but that would also be a huge surprise as he would be 110 by now. His younger co-writer still is, however, and I am talking about Michael G. Wilson here. For Maibaum and Wilson, the 007 franchise also includes their most known career efforts and Wilson even worked on the Craig films not too long ago. Now as for this one here, it has its 35th anniversary this year and it was the final effort for Roger Moore who was already getting closer to 60 by then and is as of today the only James Bond actor (actually playing Bond) that is not with us anymore. May he rest in peace and I am grateful for the body of work he left us. He always brings a slightly cheeky approach to the role, probably more comedic than everybody else, but definitely more comedic than his direct successor Dalton and also definitely more comedic than Craig. As for Connery and Brosnan, opinions may differ. With the one Lazenby movie, I am not entirely sure right now. I think I remember that his approach was also more serious. Anyway, fun quotes (on the erotic side) by Moore here mostly appear when he is in the presence of attractive women. One he asks the question if she likes it harder and for another he compares her buttocks to explosives. Enough said. This film also has a title that is a play on words per se that by the way was not translated into German, my native language. There it was just a general title. Said play on words is very unusual for the Bond franchise. Brosnan's films for example often had quotes from the movies and as for the older films, there were sometimes just the names of antagonists or even a helper once (""Octopussy"") or just terms linked to the story, time and age (""Moonraker""). Not so here. If you cut the ""a"", the meaning is entirely different. The Bond song from this film has the same title. It was made by Duran Duran and they scored a Golden Globe nomination with it. And it was a huge commercial success, made number one in the United States and that was the first time a Bond song achieved something like that. It did not manage the Oscar nomination though. Still, it shows how big Duran Duran were back then, even if not too many, especially younger listeners, are familiar with them today anymore if we compare their current popularity to the likes of other Bond song performers like Madonna, Tom Jones and also Paul McCartney.Now as for the film itself, there are once again all kinds of different locations included. Nothing too exotic this time, but the main antagonist is from France and his target is in the United States and this is also a very British movie with the horse racing going on, so basically a Bond film that focuses on industrial nations. The only difference is the beginning in the snowy mountains where Bond has to retrieve a very special item. This location was different to everything before that, but it is not the first time a film started in the mountains, not even a Bond film, not even a Roger Moore film as in another he kills his future love interest's man. But back to this one we have here now: I already mentioned the United States and the main antagonist basically wants to blow up Silicon Valley to increase his economic strength as he is a famous microchip producer and would basically stomp his only rival to the ground this way. So a fairly simple plot and idea similar to the one Goldfinger has decades earlier. I liked it somehow, others thought it was too gimmicky. But some other plans by villains in the Bond universe are simply too stupid and confusing. By the way, the main antagonist here is played by Christopher Walken, already an Oscar winner at that point. I like him and think he is a great actor, but they did not use his full potential here. Eventually, nothing about Zorin really stays memorable except his blonde hair and how he goes full berserk with the gun at the mine towards the end and also sacrifices May Day this way. Or is ready to sacrifice her I should say because Bond shows up and the two work together before she decides to commit suicide for the cause. I must say I struggled a bit with May Day's complete change in character towards the end. Sure she was disappointed because of what Zorin did, but still. I wonder if it was explanation enough to see her as a good girl. But with what she did to two other characters earlier in the film, there was probably no way she could live. Henchmen don't get arrested, but she at least took a somewhat dignified way out. I was also confused about that scene when she spends the night with Bond early on. I mean villain girls ending up in bed with Bond is not a rarity, but the circumstances felt pretty strange, especially as she loved Zorin as we find out near the end. Maybe she wanted to test him? He does not care though and there we see already that he does not love her. No jealousy. The only one he really seems to care for is his creator as we see the moment he is about to die. By the way, nice inclusion of the Golden Gate Bridge there. Actual monuments, despite all the countries in which the films are set, are not included too often. So another good move. Of course, the old man does not make it out alive either. Many people die here, more than usual I felt. It's also not a good film for Bond's fellow agents. The one he retrieves the item from at the start was killed. The Asian/American guy from the fish market also does not get lucky. And finally, Bond's likable ""butler"" is murdered by May Day, which we do not see, but find out about. This killing also results in a pretty rare moment of real anger from Moore's character when he says they should not have done that.Other than that, the film lives through its individual scenes. When they sink the car with the ""butler"" and Bond inside, that was maybe my favorite moment from the entire film. Very nicely done how Bond gets oxygene to help him and how we see from his perspective that the two bad guys are still standing up there waiting if he gets out. Very realistic that they do not go away immediately, but make sure he won't come back up on the surface. Also great camera work. Taking this into account, I was a bit surprised that Zorin was not more surprised when he ran into Bond again up there in the building that was about to burn down. But his plan there shows what a sociopath he is and how he wants to frame everybody involved while killing one character in cold blood. Still Bond also gets out of a burning elevator and building. Highly intense sequence there. Did definitely more for me than the following fire truck chase sequence. This one also involves Tanya Roberts' character and she is the main Bond girl, actually the only one if we don't count the unknown one very early on at the snow mission and May Day. I am not sure if Roberts was bad enough to receive the awards recognition she achieved, but she was mostly forgettable and I really struggled with seeing her character as a gifted scientist. I can see why awards bodies preferred Grace Jones. Her character was much better, although in my opinion she is probably the least attractive Bond girl in history. Which has nothing to do with her color and I think her character is pretty cool anyway, also how she goes out with a boom. And when we see Bond running out of the mine in Moore's usual ""ready for the next challenge style"" and Zorin's reaction to that, it was pretty funny in fact. Not sure if intentionally though. Still alright that they picked a black Bond girl, fairly unusual by then. There were many Asians before, but in terms of black Bond girls I can only think of one from years earlier from the two Bambi girls and she was only in one scene, even if she made it out alive. Halle Berry of course everybody remembers, but she came considerably later. Still, there is a connection. Hers was the final film for Brosnan, just like this one here was the final film for Moore and both did not receive a good reception at all and are considered contenders for worst Bond movie from the entire franchise. I would not go so far, at least not for this film here. It had its moments. Also many Bond films included casino and gambling games, but this is the only one that included a great deal of horse racing, which is still many people's favorite sport to bet on. So horse lovers will definitely get their money's worth. One thing that was not too logical is how Bond really managed everything on his own almost, occasionally helped from the girls (hey he was ready to commit suicide too for the cause, but May Day's words save him), even if Roberts' character again made little sense there as one half of a two man army. The focus on microchips here also takes us into the age of technology, which became a huge factor when Brosnan took over. Also the quote from Gogol about Silicon Valley at the end was hilarious in a good way. Cold War is still a thing in this movie with the Soviet Union's involvement with Zorin, but he is mostly acting out his own motives and Russia is not a main antagonist, a henchman at best. Henchnation. They really stayed careful there all the time in Bond films. Okay, that is all. Go watch this movie. And by watching this one, I have seen all the Moore 007 movies (though not chronologically as you could imagine) and there was not a single failure. Or weak film. This one gets a thumbs-up from me as well. Again, may he rest in peace. Go watch the works he left us. They are not perfection, but you certainly won't regret it unless you hate 007.",A View to a Kill
6,classicsoncall,"""He may be armed, and he's sure dangerous!""",7,3 January 2019,"I get a kick out of reading viewers' perceptions of the James Bond films and determining which ones were the best and the worst. A lot of the reviews for this movie give it a thumbs down, but quite honestly, I find all the Connery and Moore films to be about on a par. Either that or I'm not being all that critical. They're entertaining for what they are, spy genre flicks that load up on the high tech gadgets and over the top action, pretty much leaving any sort of credibility way behind. This one had the privilege of featuring Christopher Walken in the lead villain role, and how can you go wrong with that? The guy is genuinely out there in his characterizations, not only here but in most of the movies he's in portraying a villain. He's so psychopathic in this one that he actually tells KGB chief General Gogol (Walter Gotell) that he no longer considers himself part of the Soviet State Security apparatus. It got a summary response from Gogol, but in real life, Maximilian Zorin (Walken) would have been history.Like a lot of Bond films, an initial plot line is set up and then the story veers off in another direction altogether. The opening scene here has Bond retrieving a newly designed microchip impervious to magnetic pulse damage, developed by the Brits. Then, even though we learn that Zorin is hoarding the world's surplus of microchips, the one that 'Q' (Desmond Llewelyn) gushes over never comes into play again. Speaking of that opening sequence, that was a pretty slick move by Bond to take a ski-mobile away from one of the Russians. But what was the idea of playing the Beach Boys' 'California Girls' over that scene? There was no connection there whatsoever, I just had to laugh.And of course there was that entire diversion with the race horses and how Zorin's scientific genius Mortner (Willoughby Gray) came up with a steroid to overcome fatigue and have Zorin's prize horse come on strong against those with better bloodlines. It's not until Project Main Strike is mentioned that we get the real gist of the story, Zorin's desire to control the global production and distribution of computer chips, and get this, by destroying Silicon Valley in a flood! You know, it's a good thing no one ever took that idea seriously, it sounded like it could work if James Bond wasn't on the case.Oh well, I like to spoof these flicks but I do kind of enjoy them, especially the assemblage of Bond girls from picture to picture. The most unheralded one here was Fiona Fullerton as the Russian agent Pola Ivanova; she wasn't around very long. Tanya Roberts was sexy enough in the role but was kind of one dimensional as a character. With a little more work, Grace Jones might have ranked right up there with Oddjob and Jaws as one of James Bond's most vicious foes, but she had that turn at the finale when Zorin threw her under the bus, and actually wound up saving the day for Bond. But man, she did look mean, didn't she?",A View to a Kill
7,gavin6942,"Good Music, Good Villain",6,19 December 2014,"An investigation of a horse-racing scam leads 007 (Roger Moore) to a mad industrialist (Christopher Walken) who plans to create a worldwide microchip monopoly by destroying California's Silicon Valley.What makes this film pretty entertaining is the villain (does Walken ever disappoint?) and the catchy theme song that plays throughout the film in various motifs. The opening montage is a little strange (trying to get some of that MTV money), but fits the song well. Duran Duran is a great band.The casting of Grace Jones seems odd. She makes a good villain, but then to be a Bond love interest, too? With her superhuman strength and manlike physique, seems out of character for Bond. Again, a great trait for a villain, but will Bond literally sleep with anyone?",A View to a Kill
8,jboothmillard,A View to a Kill,4,10 March 2006,"This was the last film that we saw Sir Roger Moore play the great James Bond before Timothy Dalton stepped in. He had played him seven times and is still the longest running Bond so far, Sir Sean Connery's Never Say Never Again doesn't count. Anyway, Bond this time is up against American big shot Max Zorin (Christopher Walken) who is found to be planning to flood Silicon Valley with his oil wells and a bomb. He has the help of the really fit, but squeamish Stacey Sutton (Tanya Roberts). Also starring Grace Jones as May Day, Patrick Macnee as Sir Godfrey Tibbett, Patrick Bauchau as Scarpine, David Yip as Chuck Lee, Fiona Fullerton as Pola Ivanova, Manning Redwood as Bob Conley, Alison Doody as Jenny Flex, Willoughby Gray as Dr. Carl Mortner, Desmond Llewelyn as Q, Robert Brown as M, Walter Gotell as General Anatol Gogol, Geoffrey Keen as Sir Frederick Gray and Lois Maxwell as Miss Moneypenny, also for the last time. It is filled with some good chases, fights and humour, but seeing it again I can see why the critics give it two out of five stars. James Bond was number 3 on 100 Years, 100 Heroes & Villains, he was also number 21 on The 100 Greatest Sex Symbols, and he was number 21 on The 100 Greatest Pop Culture Icons, the film was was number 10 on James Bond's Greatest Hits for Duran Duran's Golden Globe nominated title song.

9,ccthemovieman-1,Moore Knew When To Get Out,5,10 September 2006,"This was Roger Moore's last James Bond effort. I salute him for doing a fine job replacing a legend in Sean Connery. However, Moore didn't go out with a bang, more like a whimper.That's the way this movie went: started with a bang with a wild opening. It was still excellent after the first half hour, but then went downhill. After the next half hour, the film was actually boring.Tanya Roberts was a pretty female lead but her overdone eye makeup made her look cheap. Grace Jones was supposed to be sexy but a woman with flat- top haircut, a ton of makeup and a constant frown on her face was anything but ""sexy."" Moore must have known this was a turkey and got out while the getting was good.",A View to a Kill
10,rmax304823,A View to a Cash Cow,4,9 June 2009,"I've sometimes wondered what keeps this franchise going. Born of Hugh Hefner's Playboy philosophy of the 1950s -- how to choose an expensive pipe, the most stylish watches, the sveltest babes -- it seems monstrously dated, eclipsed by its own imitators, all the action-by-the-numbers movies of the 1980s. It's descendants offered more gore and violence, though the wisecracks and double entendres remain at about the same level.Roger Moore as James Bond, to a beautiful young woman: ""I see you've been in the saddle."" Woman: ""Yes, I like a good morning ride."" Bond: ""I'm an early riser myself."" They all must be really expensive and, with a few exceptions, they're hard to differentiate. Oh, some star Sean Connery, some Roger Moore, and some Pearse Brosnan -- but what's the difference really? Some of the difference is in the kinds of chases, in the sense of what kind of vehicle is pursuing what other kind of vehicle. I can't remember them all, but I do recall half a dozen speedboats in the coves of Florida. This one features Moore in the driver's seat of an out-of-control fire engine pursued by the Keystone Cops, bouncing over the streets of San Francisco. (See ""Bullit"" for the original.) Then there are the glamorous women themselves. This one features Tanya Roberts as Bond's good companion. Grace Jones is the villainess, and she's startling. Her body is that of a sinewy leptosome, and her physiognomy and even her hair style are suggestive of a Tutsi warrior. Her eyes seem unable to simply look at something. They glare. And her teeth, generally exposed, are always clenched. She can't act but neither can good girl Tanya Roberts so it evens out.Yes -- the story. Moore, as Bond, foils a plot by a mad man (Christopher Walken) to blow up the reservoirs above the San Andreas fault and flood silicon valley, cornering the market for computer chips.Aside from some nicely choreographed action scenes, Walken may be the best thing about the movie. I can only think of one film in which he's given a performance so poor that it becomes ludicrous -- something to do with Anne Heche being gang banged by the police. One of the most hilarious scenes in any movie ever made HAS to be Walken's brief appearance in ""Pulp Fiction,"" a story delivered dead pan, a sentimental tale, about Walken's being a prisoner of war in Vietnam and walking around with another man's watch in his anus.I keep waiting for the series to develop Cheyne-Stokes breathing, shudder, gasp that it was once a big shot, and expire, but it never does. The last two entries feature Daniel Craig as a serious Bond, an attempt to resuscitate, I suppose.Will there be another remake? Does a bear sit in the Vatican?",A View to a Kill
11,Tweekums,Roger Moore's last outing as Bond,7,21 June 2012,"This instalment in the Bond franchise opens with 007 in Siberia retrieving a silicon chip from the frozen body of 003; of course he then has to escape across the ice on skis, a snowmobile, a makeshift snowboard and finally a boat disguised to look like a small iceberg! We soon learn that the chip recovered from Siberia matched those made by a government contractor recently taken over by Zorin Industries. Bond is given to job of investigating Zorin; a task that takes him to France where Zorin is holding a horse sale. Bond learns that Zorin is stockpiling silicon chips but at this point he has no idea why. The only real lead he finds there is a cheque written to a Stacey Sutton, Californian woman for five million dollars. It is at this point that the viewer learns his plans... he is intending to destroy Silicon Valley to give him and his associates a monopoly in silicon chip supply. Bond heads to California where he learns that Zorin is pumping sea water into a series of oil wells. He is initially told that this is routine to test the pipes but when he finds Stacey she tells him that Zorin has been trying to force her to sell her family's oil well and that pumping water into the wells is dangerous as they are on a fault. It turns out he plans to flood both the Heywood and San Andreas Faults while simultaneously blowing up the location that prevents both of them having earthquakes at the same time... Bond and Stacey only have a limited time to prevent to flooding of Silicon Valley and the drowning of hundreds of thousands of people.As with the other Roger Moore era Bond Films this one contains many elements that are fairly silly; whether that makes them more entertaining or just annoying will depend on the viewer... a case in point is the use of the song 'California Girls' as Bond 'surfs' on a makeshift snowboard in the opening scenes; personally I thought that was rather fun but I know others disagree. Christopher Walken who played the psychotic Zorin made an entertaining if somewhat OTT villain and Grace Jones was good as his Amazonian assistant May Day; although better when doing action scenes than when talking! Roger Moore once again put in a fun performance as Bond although by now he was getting a little old for the role. It wouldn't be a Bond film without exciting stunts in impressive locations; these included having Bond chase May Day in a stolen taxi as she parachuted from the Eiffel Tower; Bond fleeing from the police in a huge stolen fire engine and finally a fight on the top of San Francisco's Golden Gate Bridge. It could be argued that the plot has been taken straight from 'Goldfinger'; right down to killing the 'investor' who decides not to proceed when he learns just what the villain is planning, while this is a fair argument I don't think it spoilt the film, even if it is not in the same league as the earlier film. Overall this was a decent final Bond film for Roger Moore although it is far from his best; still it is a fun way to pass a couple of hours on a rainy afternoon!",A View to a Kill

13,BA_Harrison,Roger Moore's swan song as Bond.,7,25 March 2012,"After the abysmal mess that was Octopussy, I wouldn't have been at all surprised if Roger Moore's license to kill had been revoked right there and then, but obviously producer Cubby Brocolli thought there was life in the old Rog yet and gave him another crack as everyone's favourite secret agent in A View To A Kill, a last chance for the aging star to regain some dignity before hanging up his Walther PPK forever.The opening scene—a Siberian set piece with some awesome skiing stunts—suggests that Cubby's faith in Moore was justified: the actor acquits himself with style, looking as suave and unflappable as ever and quipping with just the right amount of camp. Being almost of bus pass age, however, Roger's stamina wasn't quite what it used to be, and there are a fair few lifeless moments where the film threatens to stall while he seemingly catches his breath.Fortunately, Moore makes sure he is well rested for the film's most elaborate set pieces—an exciting scene in a fiery lift shaft, a chase involving a San Francisco fire truck, and the excellent finale, a real showstopper that sees Bond battle with Grace Jones in a flooded mine, go up against Christopher Walken atop the Golden Gate Bridge, and take a shower with Tanya Roberts—and it is these moments that make this a more respectable way for Moore to end his stint as 007.6.5 out of 10, rounded up to 7 for IMDb.",A View to a Kill
14,moonspinner55,James Bond in Siberia...literally and figuratively,4,23 July 2010,"The 14th James Bond spy thriller, and a rather beleaguered farewell to Roger Moore in the celebrated role. 007's adventures begin in Siberia where he recovers a mysterious microchip from the now-deceased 003 and narrowly evades the Soviet army; the microchip leads Bond on the trail of an industrial scientist, who has nefarious dealings with the KGB and is hatching a plot to destroy part of California. Jam-packed with narrative and incidental characters, but dead at its core. Moore, winded and disinterested, gets through the picture but just barely. Christopher Walken and hench-woman Grace Jones are a tantalizingly evil duo, but enervated Tanya Roberts registers nothing as the resident Bond girl.

15,JohnHowardReid,Disappointing TV-style movie!,5,11 September 2017,"Admittedly, ""A view to a Kill"" certainly starts off with a bang, but, alas, it's all downhill from there, as the project quickly deteriorates into a talk, talk, talk fest, illuminated by lots of boring, and downright irritating, television-style close-ups.The movie's advertising phrase catchwords, ""Bond As Never Before"", is certainly right on target. Never has Bond looked so old and haggard, as played here by an aging Roger Moore. Even his photo on the cover of the M-G-M DVD has necessitated being touched up! (Look at it through a magnifying glass and you'll see what I mean!). The movie's advertising catch phrase, ""Bond As Never Before!"" was right on target. It turned out to be Roger Moore's final performance as James Bond. A shame! Less TV-style close-ups and more medium and long shots could have maintained the illusion that Bond was still as chipper as ever! ""Moneypenny"" is also looking old and weary!On the credit side, a lot of money has obviously been spent on actually shooting the movie. There are certainly some good stunts and a small fortune has undoubtedly been spent on crowds of extra players and filming scenes on real locations.",A View to a Kill

17,BandSAboutMovies,A rough Bond,3,14 April 2020,"This is Roger Moore's final Bond appearance and what a way to go - having a love scene with Grace Jones when he's all of 57 years old. For his part, Moore would say, ""I was only about four hundred years too old for the part."" He was not a fan of this movie, as he would later look back and say, ""I was horrified on the last Bond I did. Whole slews of sequences where Christopher Walken was machine-gunning hundreds of people. I said ""That wasn't Bond, those weren't Bond films.: It stopped being what they were all about. You didn't dwell on the blood and the brains spewing all over the place.""Walken was the third choice, as David Bowie and Sting almost played Max Zorin, the product of a Nazi genetic experiment who wants to destroy the Silicon Valley. Patrick Macnee - once John Steed from The Avengers - shows up as Sir Godfrey Tibbet and Tanya Roberts plays Bond's love interest, Stacey Sutton. Dolph Lundgren also has an early role as a KGB agent.As fuddy duddy as much of this movie feels, at least it has a great Bond song. Duran Duran killed it, pardon the pun, with ""A View to a Kill,"" which came about when bassist John Taylor, a lifelong Bond fan, drunkenly cornered Cubby Broccoli and said, ""When are you going to get someone decent to do one of your theme songs?""The movie itself is kind of all over the place with horses being given adrenaline and airships and mines. But hey - like I said, Grace Jones pins down Bond and you genuinely worry for Roger Moore's life. According to Moore's biography, she had a large black dildo with her in their bed scene.Roberts was nominated for the Worst Actress Golden Raspberry Award, but she lost to Linda Blair, who appeared in Night Patrol, Savage Island and Savage Streets. Those guys have no sense of taste whatsoever. She was one of the reasons why Moore decided to retire as Bond, as he learned he was older than her mother.",A View to a Kill
18,Coventry,Bond Mediocre Bond!,5,14 November 2015,"I usually rank my James Bond movies based on the level of evil of the main villain Therefore my favorite James Bond movies include ""You Only Live Twice"" (with Donald Pleasance as Ernst Stavro Blofeld), ""Goldfinger"" (with Gert Fröbe in the titular role), ""The Man with the Golden Gun"" (with Christopher Lee as Scaramanga) and ""License to Kill"" (with Robert Davi as Sanchez). However, this ""A View to a Kill"" made me realize that a fantastic main villain isn't enough in order to guarantee a great James Bond flick. Christopher Walken also depicts a terrific Bond villain in this movie, but the film as a whole nevertheless remains one of weaker and least memorable entries in the entire franchise. The plot is largely uninteresting, the supportive cast is wooden and many of the traditional James Bond ingredients are missing, like a nice variety of Q's hi-tech gadgets and obligatory quotes. That being said, ""A View to a Kill"" still provides nearly two full hours of campy entertainment and a handful of impressively staged stunt sequences, including a grotesque chase on skis at the beginning, a crazy parachute pursuit through the crowded streets of Paris and a climax high on top of the Golden Gate Bridge in San Francisco. Oh, and of course this particular film also features one of the catchiest and recognizable title songs, courtesy of Duran Duran. The plot deals with microchips-technology. The deranged industrialist Max Zorin implants chips in his racing horses in order to give them electrical impulses when reaching the finish line and win the races. But that is just the least disturbing part of his fiendish activities, as he also plots to neutralize California's Silicon Valley – the heart of American technology – through an immense flood caused by a self- inflicted mining disaster. The sub plot that I personally found the most fascinating sadly isn't elaborated properly, namely that Max Zorin himself is, in fact, the psychopathic result of controversial genetic experiments on pregnant women by a Nazi-scientist during World War II. It becomes quite clear in this film that the regular players are getting pathetically too old for their roles, not just Roger Moore as Bond but also Miss Moneypenny and even Q, and this has a noticeably negative impact on the chemistry between them and the supportive cast members. For instance, there isn't any plausible chemistry between James Bond and the four women that he sleeps with in ""A View to a Kill"" and most of the time he actually just resembles a sad old playboy. The most remarkable character, next to Max Zorin, is undoubtedly his eerie and super-flexible black female accomplice May Day, depicted by the natural born frightening Grace Jones. She's as evil and relentless as her master, although I personally really didn't like the plot- twist regarding her persona at the end of the movie.",A View to a Kill

21,hitchcockthelegend,There is one obstacle - Sillicon Valley in San Francisco.,6,8 July 2012,"A View to a Kill is directed by John Glen and adapted to screenplay by Richard Maibaum and Michael G. Wilson from an Ian Fleming short story titles From a View to a Kill. It stars Roger Moore, Tanya Roberts, Christopher Walken, Patrick Macnee, Grace Jones and David Yip. Music is scored by John Barry and cinematography by Alan Hume.Bond 14 and 007 is assigned to investigate millionaire industrialist and race horse owner Max Zorin, who MI6 suspect is selling critical microchip information to the Soviets.It was touch and go if Roger Moore would carry out his intention to quit the franchise, as it happened he slotted into the tux for one last time. A mistake, for although A View to a Kill is hardly the runt of the Bond litter, it's a very lazy Bond movie, one that desperately tries to hide its laziness with production values. On the plus side is that Bond here is mostly gadget free, meaning he has to use his wits and guile to either save himself and others or further his ends. But the overt humour is all over the tired script, a script that lifts from Goldfinger, thus making a mockery of the claims in some quarters that this is a fresh and imaginative Bond! it also includes one of the worst Bond girls of all time in Roberts' Stacey Sutton. Sexy without doubt, gorgeous too, but the character is nothing but a woman in peril excuse and Roberts' delivery of techno speak laughably lacks credibility.Elsewhere there are some fine performances. I'm very much in the camp that loves Walken's take on Zorin, looking like he has just stepped out of the Aryan Brotherhood, he is maniacal and callous, but Walken knows when to underplay the role and gives the clearly psychotic loon a degree of charm that underpins Zorin's edginess. Grace Jones is one of the more original Bond girls, a villainess who is highly sexual, strong of mind and a physical threat, Jones does fine work with the role, even if a sex scene with Bond is more funny than sexy. Macnee is a welcome addition, his byplay with Moore a highlight and there's a certain thrill to observing John Steed and James Bond together, even if it as two old stagers. Lois Maxwell makes her final appearance as Moneypenny, and thankfully for a change the makers giver her something to do as she goes out in the field. Fiona Fullerton slips in as KGB agent Pola Ivanova, and leaves a very good mark by paying the role with seductive charm and no little skill, really it would have made sense to have had Fullerton in the Stacey Sutton role. Other performances, though, are either weak (Yip, Willoughby Gray) or superfluous (Patrick Bauchau).Acton wise there is plenty, though not all of it works. An exciting pre-credits sequence is ruined by the crass introduction of a ski-surf escape backed by the Beach Boys singing California Girls, a ""half"" car chase in Paris is just stupid beyond belief, while a fire engine chase/escape in Frisco serves no purpose and is blighted by crude back projection. However, film is saved by Bond's participation in a steeplechase sequence, a breath taking leap from the Eiffel Tower (B.J. Worth the stunt man), underground flood peril with a murderous Zorin going bonkers and a quite excellent finale atop of the Golden Gate Bridge, resplendent with stricken airship and hand to hand combat. Hume brings vibrancy of colour at the lovely locations and Barry provides a strong score and oversees a belter of a title song by pop sensations Duran Duran. Worldwide box office cashed in $152 million, a big success but considerably down on Octopussy's take. As with all Bond films, it does have fans, but View to a Kill was fairly well assessed by the critics and Bond purists, it is tired and Moore, as game as he was, only aids the lazy feel of the film.Moore left the franchise, however, with head held well and truly high. He thought it an honour to play James Bond and during 7 films that garnered sustainable/huge box office takings, he brought his own unique entertaining brand to the much loved secret agent. It should not be forgotten that he had to take over from Connery, a task many predicted would be too much for him, and he often had to contend with silly scripts, but with The Spy Who Loved Me and For Your Eyes Only on his CV, Moore proved to be a very good Bond indeed. Now the producers once again found themselves at a crossroads with the franchise, a new actor was needed for Bond, and would they go in another direction for the new era? 6.5/10",A View to a Kill
22,Theo Robertson,Extremely Boring,5,7 August 2002,"A VIEW TO A KILL is a substandard Bond film with a rambling and boring plot involving a villain trying to create a microchip monopoly. Tanya Roberts is almost certainly the worst Bond girl ever , and we get to see the worst back projection in the series. The only thing that stops it being a serious contender for the worst Bond film is Christopher Walken. Max Zorin could possibly have been the most forgettable Bond villain ever if it wasn`t for the ridiculous ham performance of Walken , and a VIEW TO A KILL is shorter than OHMSS and MOONRAKER the two other contenders for worst Bond film",A View to a Kill
23,Scarecrow-88,A View to a Kill,7,7 July 2012,"A View to a Kill is considered bad Bond and propelled Moore out of the role he had occupied for over a decade. With a great title song from Duran Duran, the film has a unique if rather unspectacular plot (Christopher Walkin, with blond-dyed hair and sociopathic, cold-blooded method of conducting business, plans to use an earthquake to submerge Silicon Valley under water so he can take full control of the microchip industry). Walkin's Max Zorin is assisted by titanic model May Day (Grace Jones) who can lift people in the air, throwing them around like rag dolls, and is not afraid to kill for her man when needed. Tanya Roberts is a geologist (!!!) whose father once owned an oil plant Zorin stole from her, fighting him in the courts which has taken practically everything but her mansion. Patrick Macnee has a nice part as a field operative, Sir Godfrey Tibbett, who goes undercover as Bond's chauffeur, both trying to figure out what Zorin plans to do. With locations in Paris and San Francisco primarily, Bond will wind up trying to halt a bomb set in a cave near the San Andreas Fault, hang from a rope dangling from Zorin's blimp, and battle Zorin on the Golden Gate Bridge. Patrick Bauchau's Scarpine is Zorin's right-hand man, as psychopathic as his boss is. When Zorin floods the cave where the workers had been setting the explosives, he and Scarpine machine gun them all who attempt to escape from out of harm's way! Hell, Walken's Zorin laughs while shooting them as pleas of help spray out across the entire cave! Jones makes a sacrifice when Zorin betrays her, Bond gets plenty of action (not just from Walken's cronies, but with the girls, Roberts, Fiona Fullerton (as the foxy Russian agent Pola Ivanova), and even Jones!), and the climax is quite the bonafide stunner (the Golden Gate Bridge, quite a place for the hero and villain to duel, don't you think?). There's plenty of plot centered around the horse track (Zorin's is an aficionado of horses, and his mentor and ""creator"", a Nazi who was performing experiments on women to see if they could perfect a genius race, is using steroids on thoroughbreds) and stuntmen are put to good use as Moore's no spring chicken by this point. I didn't have the least bit of problem with Moore, here, as Never Say Never Again will attest to, an actor can remain in a part a little too long and strain credibility as a chick magnet, particularly when you see him in scenes next to the much younger Roberts. Roberts is eye candy, but her part is similar in acceptability as Denise Richards' role was in a later Pierce Brosnan Bond vehicle. Moore's chase of Jones through Paris in a car that takes a licking and keeps ticking with just two tires left and half a torso gone once he reaches her to a boat, unable to reach her is quite a stunt sequence.",A View to a Kill
24,LeonLouisRicci,Above Average Roger Moore James Bond but Average at Best Bond Movie,7,24 January 2017,"Uneven but not the Worst Roger Moore Bond Film, and that somewhat Surprises.

25,CinemaSerf,A view to a Coke!,6,28 March 2020,"Roger Moore's last outing as 007 is his weakest. This story that Christopher Walker ""Zorin"" plans to dominate the world micro-chip industry by destroying California's silicon valley takes the franchise just a shade beyond credible. Whilst Grace Jones ""May Day"" is lithe and beautiful, she has no subtlety or panache and Walken hasn't the script or the charisma to do justice to his role as the megalomanic industrialist. Moore tries his best, and with early appearances by Patrick Macnee there is a semblance of some of the style of films gone before; but as it develops this is all - except, perhaps, the ""butterfly act"" about large scale photography and product placement. Duran Duran & John Barry got a Golden Globe for the title song, but that is probably the only highlight for me...",A View to a Kill
26,zardoz-13,Roger Moore's Final Appearance as 007 Isn't As Bad As Some Argue.,8,26 February 2009,"The fourteenth James Bond extravaganza ""A View to a Kill"" pitted 007 (Roger Moore) against the franchise's most psychotic villain, 'staunch, anti-Communist,' French industrialist Max Zorin (Oscar winner Christopher Walken of ""The Deer Hunter""), who schemes to corner the micro-chip market by destroying Silicon Valley. Essentially, this Bond movie recalled Goldfinger because Zorin resembled Goldfinger with his wealth and his plan to wipe out Silicon Valley the way that Goldfinger wants to take over the gold market by turns America's supply of gold at Fort Knox in a radioactive rubble. Indeed, as villains go, Zorin ranks as one of the more memorable with an interesting back story. A Nazi scientist had conducted steroid tests with pregnant women and most of the offspring died, but Zorin survived to become a genius but a psychotic. Zorin and the good doctor who had been captured by the Soviets after World War II helped their athletes. Mind you, the Bond movies neither demonized the Soviets, nor did they romanticize the Russkies. The Soviets made mistakes, but they always managed to clean up after themselves. In ""Octopussy,"" the Soviets caught up with a renegade black market General Orlov (Steven Berkoff of ""Beverly Hills Cop"") who tried to start a nuclear war and frame the Americans. In ""A View to a Kill,"" the Soviet catch up with Zorin who had been in cahoots with them in the microchip manufacturer business but the two fell out. Indeed, like all the Roger Moore Bond's after ""Live and Let Die,"" ""A View to a Kill"" takes place with in the context of the Cold War. Furthermore, while tensions exist between East and West, there is also an air of détente that characterize these Bonds. Although it proved to be Roger Moore's last mission as James Bond and it didn't surpass the box office receipt of ""Octopussy,"" ""A View to a Kill"" contains more than enough virtues, such as the snow pursuit in Siberia, Bond's careening car chase through Paris, and Zorin's sadistic massacre of his own men in a secluded mine in California. Original 007 composer John Barry provides a strong, atmospheric orchestral soundtrack and the Duran Duran title tune is a knock-out! The Richard Maibaum & Michael G. Wilson screenplay contains a some imaginative twists on the Bond formula, especially with regard to the sacrificial girl convention. Essentially, the sacrificial girl in most Bonds is either an agent working with Bond as in ""Thunderball"" or the villain's girl as in ""The Man with the Golden Gun."" Oh, yes, let's not forget Plenty O'Toole who stumbles into bad girl Tiffany Case's house and dies because the villains catch her. The difference with ""A View to a Kill"" is that Mayday (Grace Jones) is not only Zorin's main squeeze but also a villainess herself. She has to die, but her death is heroic. Alan Hume's cinematography is good and John Glen never lets the pace flag in his third outing as a Bond helmer.Director John Glen, in his three outing as a Bond helmer, stages several interesting sequences. The fistfights are rather conventional, primarily those at Zorin's laboratories and in Stacy Sutton's home, but Zorin's plan for Operation: Mainstrike against Silicon Valley takes place in a zeppelin, but we don't know that until one of Zorin's associates literally takes a walk into thin air for refuses to participate in his Silicon Valley scheme. The scene opens in a conference room as Zorin explains how Mainstrike will work and we don't know until the last second that they are hundreds of feet in the air. The fire truck chase with the SFPD in pursuit is reminiscent of ""Diamonds Are Forever"" and ""Live and Let Die."" There's a robust disaster sequence when Zorin kills a San Francisco City Hall official and traps Stacy and Bond in an elevator while setting the building ablaze. Stacy Sutton (Tanya Roberts of TV's ""Charlie's Angels"") qualifies as the most annoyingly hysterical heroine of the franchise. She screams convincingly throughout the blazing city hall predicament. As seemingly lightweight as ""A View to a Kill"" is you cannot overlook Sir Godfrey Tibbett's murder by Mayday and Zorin's decision to plunge a KGB agent into a shaft with a whirling propeller at the other end. Actually, we see him thrown into the shaft by Zorin's men and he dies in a gush of water. Occasionally, Bonds contain gruesome death scenes that—owing to their PG-ratings—are left to the imagination of the spectator. Of course, it isn't as grisly as the snow plow scene in ""On Her Majesty's Secret Service,"" but violence does creep into every Bond.The scenes at Zorin's equine stables and the eccentric Frenchman's château is scenic. The idea that Zorin and his doctor pal are tampering with horse races is no doubt inspired by the characteristically decadent Ian Fleming villain who cannot help but cheat, even when he has more money that most people. Christopher Walken with his blond hair is ideally cast as the devious Zorin. Unfortunately, to be as nefarious as Zorin is, he lets 007 off the hook too easily. Bond's escape from the sinking car is slick but far from believable and the shift from the lake to San Francisco is the film's weakest link. Furthermore, Patrick Macnee's demise is glossed over too much. Patrick Bauchan plays Zorin's right-hand man and actress Alison Doody is one of his girls. Robert Brown plays M and Lois Maxwell plays Ms. Moneypenny for the last time. Bond regular Walter Gotell reprises his role as the sympathetic KGB chief, while future B-movie action star Dolph Lundgren has a moment as a KGB henchman at a race track when the Soviets upbraid Zorin. ""A View to a Kill"" isn't as bad as some might argue. It tops ""Live and Let Die"" and ""The Man with the Golden Gun,"" but it isn't as great as ""The Spy Who Loved Me.""",A View to a Kill

He plays an excellent psychopath, a bit over the top maybe but very entertaining nevertheless. One of the better Bond villain. The rest of the cast is also good and it's hard to believe that Roger Moore was already in his late 50's while making this movie. Grace Jones portrays the legendary character May Day which also is a big addition to the movie. Another wonderful addition to the cast is Patrick Macnee.Like in all Bond movies the story is actually quite silly and unbelievable. But then again Bond movies are not known for their realism, their are known for their very high entertainment value and entertaining this movie is.The movie is full with great moments, maybe even more then all the other Bond movies. One of the better moments is the escape from the burning building, it's great not as much visually but more musically. And the golden gate bridge finale is maybe one of the best Bond endings.

So in order to track down the security leak he begins his investigating with the founder of the computer corporation that produced the microchip, ""Max Zorin"" (Christopher Walken). Unfortunately, getting close to Max Zorin, or finding any clues, becomes rather difficult because of his extremely tight security which includes his own personal bodyguard by the name of ""May Day"" (Grace Jones). Now rather than reveal any more of this movie I will just say that this turned out to be an okay ""James Bond"" film for the most part. Although I thought that Roger Moore performed in his usual competent manner, I have to admit that Christopher Walken essentially stole the show with an exceptional performance as the main villain. Likewise, having the beautiful Tanya Roberts (as ""Stacey Sutton"") grace the screen certainly didn't hurt either. On the other hand, I felt that the performance of Grace Jones was slightly uneven and that the movie itself seemed to drag a bit here and there.

Soon 007 faces off against the villainous Zorin and his tough Amazonian bodyguard, May Day, who are scheming to cause massive destruction that will eliminate the competition.........Yes, the film makes absolutely no sense at all (Zorin Wants to destroy Silicon Valley, because of competition, the Valley only manufactures micro-chips, it doesn't sell them, and the sub-plot about horses has nothing whatsoever to do with the film), but it's still enjoyable as a guilty pleasure.And if like me, your a Bond fanatic, it has one of the best scores Barry has done, and Walken is a wonderful Bond Villain.But then there are the negatives, Moore is far too old to play Bond, he even states this in several interviews, location wise it's the least glamorous, and Grace Jones, well, she. Should have just kept her mouth shut and be a silent hench-person, she's stunning and scary to look at, but as soon as she speaks, it takes you away from the film.Walken, as I be said before, is brilliant, psychotic and clever, a literal experiment with nothing to lose, could he be Bonds Joker? There are certainly times when he has Joker- esque tendencies, especially his laugh before he takes his final drop.It's just a shame that the middle of the film is just so saggy, Tanya Roberts is okay as a Bond girl, but she screams way too much, and its almost as if you can leave the film once May-Day jumps off the Eiffel Tower, and return just after Zorin has massacred his crew.The final battle is pretty breathtaking, but it's over too quickly, which is a shame, because the cinematography is stunning.So all in all, it's not Moore's poorest effort, that lies with Octopussy, the Duran Duran Theme is the best Bond song ever, and there is a strange sound effect where Moore goes 'oooooooooohhhhhh!!' And it's used at least six times.It's better than you remember....",A View to a Kill
33,Aaron1375,Roger Moore's final go as Bond a nice send off,8,14 December 2014,"For a lot of people, Roger Moore is usually dismissed from the 'who was the best Bond' argument. For me, he was my favorite, possibly still is. Part of the reasons for this is a pure nostalgia factor in that he was the Bond when I was growing up. His films were the ones that were on television and when there was a new film he was Bond. Another reason he may be my favorite is the movies themselves. His Bond films were an eclectic collection of movies that were usually fast paced and fun. Most of his films featured multiple exotic locations , lots of cool action sequences and an awesome villain. Roger Moore's Bond got to duel with Christopher Lee and in this one Christopher Walken two of the best actors to portray Bond villains. Sure, Octopussy was almost the Austin Power's of its day in that it was almost a parody, but this one reigned in the campiness a bit and while not his best work, still ended his tenure as Bond in nice fashion. Not perfect, mind you, as Timothy Dalton's 'The Living Daylights' would be better, this one is still is a good Bond film that probably did represent the 80's more so than did any other Bond film from its opening featuring a Duran Duran song and lots of neon to the inclusion of Grace Jones as villainous sidekick Mayday.The story has Bond recovering a microchip from a Russian facility that mirrors one at a plant run by Max Zorin. Meaning that somehow the Russians have gotten a hold of one of these chips. James sets out to investigate Zorin at his horse staples as Zorin seems to also have an unnatural edge in the racing of horses as well. It is not too long before Zorin tries to off Bond and show himself as the bad guy and soon Bond must go to San Francisco where he must try to figure out what Zorin's plans are as Zorin seems to be plotting something large. Bond will be assisted by a lady that Zorin has been trying to pay off and intimidate and together they will find themselves in a cave that is laden with Zorin's men as they plan to do something insane to turn the world of computers and microchips decidedly in Zorin's favor.Roger Moore was quite old by this time and it was time for him to relinquish the role of 007. That being said, he still did a great job as the one thing you can say about him is that unlike Sean Connery near the end of his run as Bond, Moore still seemed to have fun doing it. In fact, I would say had Moore started as Bond instead of Connery, he would likely have kept the role up to View To a Kill. Here his age is apparent, as he is older than Connery, so one knows that you're mainly getting stunt doubles, but they made it work. Christopher Walken is the main villain of the piece and he is crazy good. Probably one of the more psychotic Bond villains he relishes killing those who work for him and laughs as he faces death. Grace Jones is also in this film and like most of the villains henchmen, she is a formidable opponent. Patrick Mcnee also does a good job as the agent initially investigating Zorin's horses. Now for the main problem with the film, Tanya Roberts. She has the looks, but she just does not seem like a Bond girl to me. She is perhaps, my least favorite Bond girl besides Denise Richards in The World is Not Enough.So, I think this film was a nice farewell for Roger Moore as Bond. I actually thought Octopussy was good too, but this one was just a better send off as it had less comedic elements than did that film. Like I stated above, that one was nearly a parody in areas. Roger Moore's age does show, but he still carries the film well as he faces off a very nice opponent in Zorin played by Walken. I did not enjoy this one as much when I was younger, but it has grown on me, it is just nice to see so many very well down practical special effects rather than mainly CGI ones that accompany nearly every film released these days. It is also interesting that this is the film that sort of brought snowboarding into the open and made it quite big, so Roger Moore's final Bond film did start something rather big and that is rather cool. So is this filmnot even Moore's best Bond movie, but a nice cool entry into the series and a nice farewell to probably the actor who enjoyed being Bond the most.",A View to a Kill
34,Wuchakk,"Not as good as the previous four, but still a solid Bond film with Christopher Walken, Tanya Roberts and Grace Jones",7,2 September 2018,"A mission in wintery Siberia leads Agent 007 (Roger Moore) to globetrot from England to Paris to San Francisco and Silicon Valley investigating a horse-racing scam and the psychopathic entrepreneur, Max Zorin (Christopher Walken), who schemes to flood Silicon Valley for the purpose of creating a global microchip monopoly.This was Moore's last of 7 Bond films from 1973-1985 and it's a solid Bond flick, just not up to the exceptionalness of the previous four films: ""The Spy Who Loved Me"" (1977), ""Moonraker"" (1979), ""For Your Eyes Only"" (1981) and ""Octopussy"" (1983). Just as ""For Your Eyes Only"" toned down the excesses of ""Moonraker,"" so ""A View to a Kill"" (1985) scales things down after the ultra-action-packed adventures of ""Octopussy.""As such, the movie focuses a little more on the psychological drama of intrigue and rivalry. For instance, there's a long sequence at Zorin's impressive chateau and a horse racing scene that's reminiscent of the low-key golf game in ""Goldfinger"" (1964). Despite this direction, there's still a lot of action, like a thrilling ski chase in Siberia, a murder/chase at the Eiffel Tower & Paris, a brouhaha at a mansion, a fiery elevator shaft episode, a wild vehicle chase through the streets of San Francisco with a fire engine, an extended clash in Zorin's mine complex near the San Andreas fault and a thrilling climax at the Golden Gate Bridge.On the female front, Tanya Roberts is just stunning and has a couple of quality scenes. A year earlier she did ""Sheena"" where she had to thin down to fit into a skimpy animal-skin bikini (although she still looked great). Meanwhile Grace Jones is a formidable villainous with an interesting story arc. Mary Ann Catrin Stavin also has a quality cameo in the opening teaser.I shouldn't close without mentioning critics' denouncements of Zorin's psychopathic actions in the mines. I don't get these whiney criticisms, are Bond villains supposed to be nice guys or something? Zorin is mad and this is what megalomaniacal whack jobs do!The film runs 2 hours, 11 minutes.GRADE: B",A View to a Kill

The business man (not sure of his name) joins a gallery of minor characters who meet gruesome deaths at the expense of a funny quip, e.g. the gangster who witnesses The Joker's pencil trick, the guy who is Arnie's body shield in Total Recall.This was Roger Moore's final performance as Bond, and since then I haven't watched a Bond movie.

37,SimonJack,Bond climbs the Eifel Tower and hangs out atop the Golden Gate Bridge,7,10 May 2018,"""A View to Kill"" was the last of the Agent 007 movies that starred Roger Moore as James Bond. As with Sean Connery before him, Moore slowed down with age toward the end of his reign in the role. That refers to the amount, level and finesse of their physical prowess. Each older Bond has much less fighting, and the martial arts of the ""older"" scenes don't seem quite authentic - with the bad guys having to slow down accordingly. But, this film has plenty of action otherwise. It's one of the few films that doesn't have a big piece of the story take place in a tropical setting. Instead of exotic locales, this film has scenes in London, Paris, San Francisco and the Bay area, especially the Silicon Valley. Action scenes take place on the Eifel Tower and atop the Golden Gate Bridge. The interesting plot is set around the San Andreas Fault in California.Christopher Walken is the guest villain. He plays psychopath Max Zorin whose plot is to corner the world's computer chip industry. Patrick Macnee, former star of the long-running TV series, ""The Avengers,"" plays an MI6 cohort of Bond's, Sir Godrey Tibbett. He's their resident expert on art. Here are a couple of favorite lines from the film. Sir Godfrey Tibbett, ""Another wealthy owner?"" James Bond, ""Who knows. But she'd certainly bear closer inspection."" Sir Godfrey, ""We're on a mission."" James Bond, ""Sir Godfrey, on a mission I am expected to sacrifice myself.""Max Zorin, ""You amuse me, Mr. Bond.""

He's very much long in the tooth here, and the silicon valley scheme is one of the sillier OO7 plots. Mostly, it just kinda stumbles along. to its credit, it does have Christopher Walken, an actor who relishes his role as the bad guy and genuinely looks like he's having a good time (in direct opposition to Moore in this case).It's not at ""Die Another Day"" levels of bad, and it helps that the intro song is one of the greats, but this is a snoozer. 4/10",A View to a Kill

40,ShadeGrenade,Roger keeps the British end up one last time,9,4 June 2012,"Days before the rogue Bond movie 'Never Say Never Again' - which starred Sean Connery - opened in London at the end of 1983, Cubby Broccoli managed to pull off a champion spoiler. He announced that Roger Moore - who had declared his retirement from the role earlier that year with 'Octopussy' - had signed for a seventh movie, provisionally titled 'From A View To A Kill'. In other words, it didn't matter whether or not 'Again' was a hit, because Moore was still going to be around in the future. Loosely based on Ian Fleming's short story ( which appeared in the 'For Your Eyes Only' collection ) 'A View To A Kill' appeared two years later, again directed by John Glen. Critics who had claimed the 56-year old star too old for the role had to eat their words - in fact, he looks in better condition than Connery did in 'Again'. The plot by Michael G.Wilson and Richard Maibaum has Bond investigating the nefarious activities of millionaire 'Maz Zorin' ( Christopher Walken ). When I saw this originally, I chuckled. ""They've remade 'Goldfinger!"", I thought. ""Only with microchips instead of gold bullion!"". The two films are similarly structured. Instead of cheating at cards, Zorin is fixing horse races with the aid of steroids and micro-chips. Whereas Goldfinger wanted to increase the value of his gold by blowing up Fort Knox, Zorin wants to increase the value of his micro-chips by triggering an earthquake along the San Andreas Fault, California, thus destroying Silicon Valley.'Kill' is a long way from 'Goldfinger' in terms of quality, of course, but it is much better than 'Again'. The equivalent 'Oddjob' is the enigmatic 'May Day', played with gusto by singer Grace Jones. Strangely, she never gets to fight Bond, which is a pity as the posters gave the impression such a skirmish was going to the movie's highlight. The action scenes start with an impressive Siberian skiing sequence ( marred only by the use of the Beach Boys' 'California Girls' ), and go on to include May Day jumping off the Eiffel Tower, Bond losing half his car in a chase, Bond and 'Stacy Sutton' ( Tanya Roberts of 'Charlie's Angels' ) trapped in a burning lift shaft, a chase involving a runaway fire engine in San Francisco, and Bond and May Day in a flooding mine, culminating in a climax involving an airship and the Golden Gate bridge. One of the film's pleasures is seeing Moore alongside Patrick Macnee of 'The Avengers', cast as 'Sir Godfrey Tibbett', Bond's sidekick. There is an amusing scene with Bond posing as a rich man and Tibbett as his chauffeur. It is a pity Tibbett was written out so soon. More of him and less of Fiona Fullerton's arch Russian agent - 'Pola Ivanova' - would have helped the movie no end. Moore was reputedly uncomfortable with some of the more violent aspects, such as Zorin machine-gunning to death his own men. With its lively 'Duran Duran' theme song, 'A View To A Kill' was another big hit when it opened in the summer of 1985. Though it was not formally announced at the time, it was obvious that Moore was not coming back. Ditto Lois Maxwell as 'Miss Moneypenny'. His tenure as 007 - seven films across twelve years - marks him as the longest serving incumbent in the role. He might not have pleased humourless Ian Fleming fans, but there is no denying that he was massively popular with the general public. His successor, Timothy Dalton, was closer to the original Fleming character but the public chose not to endorse him. It was not until the arrival of Pierce Brosnan in 1995 that Moore was successfully replaced. The look of pleasure Moore put on the faces of cinema-goers world-wide took a long time to fade.",A View to a Kill
41,JamesHitchcock,Roger Moore finally topples over into self-parody,5,6 August 2013,"""A View to a Kill"" was the seventh and last film to star Roger Moore as James Bond. The basic plot is essentially the same as the one previously used in ""Goldfinger"", ""The Spy Who Loved Me"" and ""Moonraker"", the one about the megalomaniac business tycoon with ambitions of world domination. (This plot was later to be recycled in two Bonds from the Pierce Brosnan era, ""Tomorrow Never Dies"" and ""Die Another Day""). The villain in this case is the billionaire industrialist Max Zorin, who plans to destroy California's Silicon Valley by setting off a gigantic earthquake. (His motive is that this would give his European-based company a virtual monopoly of the world microchip market). The film is often regarded as one of the weakest of the James Bond series. Even its star Roger Moore is said to have disliked it, which is ironic given that it was Moore's own performance which has been the source of much of the criticism. Ian Fleming seems to have envisaged Bond as being in his mid-thirties, but Moore (46 when he took over the role in 1973) was 58 in this film, and seems far too old to be playing an active MI6 field agent. He always played Bond in a rather lighter, more humorous way than his predecessor Sean Connery, but here he finally topples over into self-parody, putting very little effort into his acting and relying entirely upon his standard repertoire of witty quips and raised eyebrows as his sole means of conveying emotion. Moore's acting, however, is not the only bad thing about the film. Indeed, it is probably not even the worst thing. The structure of the film is deficient; too much of it (indeed, the entire first half, set in France) is taken up with a horse-racing sub-plot in which it appears that Zorin's main crime is doping his horses. It is only when the action moves to California that we discover what the villain's real design is. It is normally a bad sign when Bond producers feel the need to confer some academic qualification upon the main female character in order to make her seem less of a bimbo; think of Lois Chiles's boring astrophysicist Holly Goodhead (aka Airhead) in ""Moonraker"", or the inept Denise Richards's performance as the oddly named scientist Christmas Jones in ""The World is Not Enough"". Here we are supposed to accept that Tanya Roberts's character Stacey Sutton is a qualified geologist, but whenever she has to say something on the subject of geology it is all too obvious that she has little idea what she is talking about. Not that she is any more convincing talking about anything else. Tanya was always an actress who relied more on looks than on talent, as she showed in her contributions to the ""Charlie's Angels"" series, and while she is not quite as awesomely bad here as she had been the previous year in ""Sheena Queen of the Jungle"", she certainly deserved her second ""Worst Actress"" Razzie nomination in as many years. So is Tanya the worst ever Bond Girl? There is plenty of competition for that particular title, but actually she is not even the worst Bond Girl in ""A View to a Kill"". Grace Jones, in my book probably the strongest contender for the ""worst ever"" title, gives a singularly wooden performance as Zorin's bodyguard and sidekick May Day, and unlike Roberts, Chiles, Richards, Barbara Bach and other below-par Bond Girls she does not even have looks to rely on. Christopher Walken can be good when playing unsympathetic characters, so it was a disappointment that his Zorin makes such a bloodless villain. All Bond villains are evil, but at least with the likes of Gert Froebe's Goldfinger, Donald Pleasence's Blofeld, Christopher Lee's Scaramanga or Michael Lonsdale's Drax we get a good idea of the passions which motivate their villainy. With Zorin we get nothing but a cold-blooded psychopathy. Zorin and May Day are supposed to be lovers as well as partners in crime- indeed, she turns on him after discovering that he has betrayed her- so it is a pity that there is so little chemistry between the two actors. It is also a pity that a larger role could not have been found for the lovely Fiona Fullerton. The previously obscure actor Robert Brown never really made the role of M his own in the way that his predecessor Bernard Lee did, but there are good contributions from two other regular faces, Lois Maxwell in her last appearance as Miss Moneypenny and Desmond Llewelyn as Q. Other positive features include Duran Duran's theme song and a couple of good suspense sequences, that car chase through the streets of San Francisco with Bond and Stacey in a fire engine and the final cliff-hanger aboard the airship and on the Golden Gate Bridge. Overall, however, I would agree with those who regard this as a sub- standard contribution to the series. Indeed, when it first came out I would have rated it as the worst Bond since George Lazenby's disastrous contribution in ""OHMSS"". (Since 1985 ""Licence to Kill"" and ""Quantum of Solace"" have joined them as possible candidates for the title ""worst ever Bond""). ""A View to a Kill"" was certainly the weakest entry during the Moore era. After it came out there could be no denying that it was time for a change. Whether Timothy Dalton was a change in the right direction is another matter. 5/10",A View to a Kill

43,DKosty123,"This Film is often Under-Rated, Better Than others over Time",6,26 August 2005,"While Ian Fleming created a great character in 007, time is wilting away the logic to a lot of the plots to the early films in this series. While this one still has touches of the Cold War Theme, the plot actually holds up better over time than some of the other films. In fact, this film does very well with the location shots being scenic including the Eifel Tower & Golden Gate Bridge in the same film.Even though Flemming's material is long gone by this time the plot in this film actually holds together quite well. Actually, in a way the plot borrows on the plot of Goldfinger replacing Gold with sand. This does hold the film together quite well. The biggest problem with this film is Tanya Roberts, on my list the second worst Bond girl. Trouble is there is nothing good to balance her here & since her poor performance dominates the film, we are stuck with her here.(In case your wondering, the worst Bond Girl of the entire series is Lynn-Holly Johnson. In FOR YOUR EYES ONLY, Lynn proved she can't act, & couldn't even be a believable skater even though in real life she is one. Carol Bouquet balances her off because she is one of the best Bond women ever, because without her, Lynn would have killed the series off for Moore sooner.) Christopher Walken is good as the heavy in this. Grace Jones does a good turn as ""Mayday"" also. Roberts is the reason this ended Roger Moore's reign as 007. Maybe this is a good thing, but I wish they could re-shoot it with another better actress (not Johnson) because this film is good. The scenery is good, and the rest of the cast brings this off well. The stunts in this one are top notch too. This film grows on you when you watch it. There are times when Moore's advanced age shows up plainly though.",A View to a Kill
44,KineticSeoul,"Moore's last outing as Bond doesn't end with a bang, but it's passable",5,8 February 2016,"One of the staples that made the 007 franchise to become so popular. Is because Bond is a character that men wanted to be and women find irresistible. No one wants to get old and Roger Moore was close to his 60's when this movie came out. So this movie seemed more like a fantasy movie for 60 year olds and above than a movie that teens or people in there 20's or even 30's would think of as a cool watch. Plus Roger Moore clearly did eye lifts that made him look creepy. Men who are still womanizers in there 60's just isn't a good look for a guy. So it takes away the charm and suave of the Bond character. Sure, it's not Roger Moore's fault for aging, but they needed a new Bond. I mean the Bond girls in this could be his daughters or maybe even granddaughters. Even the male characters Bond interacts with are either old or older than him to make Bond look more attractive from the bunch. Going as far as the make the villains a bunch of grandpas so Bond wouldn't have as much trouble taking them on. So it just came off a bit uncomfortable than sexy when he made his move on the Bond girls. As for the plot, it takes a bit of the plot from ""Goldfinger"". Tanya Roberts as Stacey is one of the Bond girls with very glamorous eyes in the franchise so far. Christopher Walken is a good actor and could have been a great villain for Bond. But they dropped the ball on that one as well by giving him lame mannerisms and character. His motives weren't at least understandable and lacked the strong villainous presence that was needed to make this a memorable Bond film. It really is a shame, because this isn't just Moore's last outing as Bond. But it's the last Bond film when it comes to original Bond story line on film with the next installment being a reboot.5/10",A View to a Kill

In this story, Bond returns from the USSR with a computer chip, which is immune to a nuclear electromagnetic pulse and was created by Max Zorin (Christopher Walken) of Zorin Industries. Bond discovers that Zorin is planning to set off an earthquake in San Andreas that will wipe out all of Silicon Valley.There are some intense action scenes followed by a fast-paced and exciting plot by Richard Maibaum and Michael G. Wilson. John Glen gave solid direction to this film. Moore's continuing unique suaveness and charm as 007 kept this movie entertaining and, this being Moore's 7th and final appearance as 007, it appeared he was just having a blast for his farewell. I thought Moore added more humor and physical comedy in his acting, especially during the chase scene through a wedding party (Bond hands the wedding cake to the groom he had just accidentally smashed and says, ""Congratulations!""). Max Zorin makes a ruthless and crafty villain, making you love to root against him. May Day (Grace Jones) proved to be a seductive but formidable opponent to Bond and Tanya Roberts makes a charming Bond girl.Loaded with thrills and drama, this is a fine film that closes Moore's Bond saga.Grade A",A View to a Kill
46,bensonmum2,"""Hello. My name is James St. John Smythe. I'm English.""",3,2 September 2009,"As a rule, I love James Bond movies. I was born the year after Dr. No was released, so I've kind of grown up with the series. As a kid in the 70s, some of my fondest movie related memories are of those Sunday nights that ABC would air a Bond movie. I couldn't wait to see the car chases, the gadgets, the fight scenes, and the over-the-top villains. It was a great time. That's why it pains me to rate A View to a Kill as low as I do. While there are a few James Bond movies that I have problems with, this is really the only one in the entire series that I would call a bad movie. In fact, I can't think of a single positive thing to write. Watching A View to a Kill last night was akin to nails on a chalk board. Everything about the movie scrapes the proverbial bottom of the James Bond barrel:  Roger Moore – I'm not a Roger Moore hater, but by the time he made A View to a Kill, he was way too old to pull it off. He looks absolutely ridiculous romancing the young hotties. And that dye job – it's the worst. The Bond Girls – Some Bond girls are better than others, but there are none as bad as the two in A View to a Kill. Grace Jones – she's got to be the most unattractive female to ever appear in a Bond movie. Who in the world ever thought she was sexy? If I saw anymore of her backside, I think I might have ripped my eyes out. Tanya Roberts – she probably the worst actress to ever appear in a Bond movie. Imagining her as a geologist is about as silly as picturing Denise Richards as a nuclear scientist (oh wait, she did play a nuclear scientist in a Bond movie). And if Tanya had whined the world ""James"" one more time, I think I might have ripped my ears off. Christopher Walken – Don't misunderstand, I like Christopher Walken. But could he have looked any more foolish than he does with blond hair? Why did they have to do that?  The Plot – I've got two problems with the film's plot. First, the whole idea of flooding Silicon Valley is beyond stupid. I don't see how it would have accomplished much of anything. Wouldn't companies have just gone elsewhere to produce their computer chips? Second, can someone please explain to me what the steroid injected horses in the first half of the movie have to do with the flooding Silicon Valley plot of the second half of the movie? It's like the entire first hour of the movie was little more than padding.I could go on and on (Duran Duran's crappy title song, the use of rear projection anytime Roger Moore is supposed to be doing anything physical, the all too obvious stunt doubles, the groan inducing quips, the fire truck chase, the film's title being forced into the dialogue, Q as a peeping tom, etc.), but I'll stop there. You get the idea – I don't like A View to a Kill. In fact, with each successive viewing, I like it less and less. I'm at the point now where I pretty much hate it and doubt I'll ever give it another chance. It's just bad.",A View to a Kill
47,gridoon,Middling Bond; Great Villain,5,17 February 2005,"""A View To A Kill"" is a big comedown for 007 after ""For Your Eyes Only"" and ""Octopussy"". In fact, of all the Bond movies that Roger Moore made, only ""The Man With The Golden Gun"" is worse. At least this one has more action than ""TMWTGG"" - the car stunts in Paris rank with the best of the series. But John Glen's direction has no pace, no excitement; in the first half, we spend too much time around Zorin's luxurious mansion and his stables, and in the end we get way too much footage of the mine flooding. The one saving grace of the film is Christopher Walken, who doesn't really play a Bond villain; he plays a Walken villain, perverted and smug about it. His reaction to the information that Bond is ""extremely dangerous"", and the scene where he completes the last phrase of a man (""DEAD!"") and then shoots him in cold blood, are gems of acting. As for Tanya Roberts...sure, no acting talent, but for sheer physical beauty she is hard to surpass. (**)",A View to a Kill
48,Lejink,Stop The Bond I Want To Get Off,4,10 September 2020,"Roger Moore's last outing as James Bond, although you could see it coming from two or three films back. Unfortunately it doesn't exactly end on a high for him being also the third of director John Glen's ""Dull-ogy"" of three 007 adventures in a row, all I which I found plodding and underwhelming. Personally, I found ""Octopussy"" to be worse than this as ""A View To A Kill"" does at least have a scant few redeeming features.Firstly the title song actually sounded up to date wasn't a lush ballad and was by a current hit act, then teen idols Duran Duran and their collaboration with house-composer John Barry yields a surprisingly impressive end product, Barry remarking at the time it was the first time he'd written a song to a drum pattern. Certainly the best since McCartney's ""Live And Let Die"", which of course was Moore's first Bond feature. Then there's the inclusion, at least for the first fifty minutes, of the original, accept-no-substitute Avenger, Patrick Macnee as Bond's quite literal sidekick. I enjoyed seeing these two old ITC stalwarts bouncing off each other and thought it a shame that they couldn't resurrect Diana Rigg to get her in on the act too.But that's about it, I'm afraid. Christopher Walken's psychopathic megalomaniac Max Zorin exhibits a callousness at odds with Moore and Macnee's old-fashioned politesse and his plot to flood Silicon Valley so that he can corner the market in microchips seems a bit overthought to me, hey Max, why not just rob a bank or hold someone or other to ransom. Odder yet is Grace Jones's casting as Zorin's girlfriend / hired muscle (you better believe it, the way she hoists James and a live bomb up from a collapsed mine). Out of nowhere, after all it's the equivalent of James coupling with Odd Job or Jaws, Bond beds her May Day character, the thought of which I don't want to begin to imagine in my head, 'nuff said.The stunts and one-liners don't save the day either. There's a distinct lack of the latter, in fact Simon LeBon's pay-off line in the Duran pop video is far funnier than anything you get here while the would-be spectacle of high jinks up the Eiffel Tower or Golden Gate Bridge are hopelessly compromised by the zillion cut-aways and poorly back-projected inserts from Moore to the no doubt various stunt-men employed to do the heavy lifting. It was disappointing too to see old ideas rehashed, such as the car chase led by a big-mouthed American police chief, or Zorin making an example of the one crime boss who doesn't want to follow the masterplan.As for the other Bond girls, they registered with this viewer as little as they likely did in Bond's memory after their various one-night stands. I thought progress was being made when the old lech lets you g-enough-to-be-his-daughter Tanya Roberts alone at one point but of course that is rectified (no pun intended) for the familiar closing shot, under the remote view of an increasingly perverse Q.Moore certainly did his part in restoring the franchise to prominence after the relative failure of George Lazenby's one shot and out, but on the evidence of this, he was right to revoke his licence after this and let someone younger have a go.",A View to a Kill
49,bowmanblue,Not bad Bond,8,3 August 2017,"'A View to a Kill' has an odd reputation. It was the last in Roger Moore's Bond films and it seemed that most people couldn't get past the fact that he had one too many wrinkles and therefore was probably due a Dr Who-like regeneration. Now, they may have a point. He was looking a little too 'lived in' even by Bond's mature standards, but, if you can get over the fact that he obviously wasn't as sprightly as he once was, it's still a fun enough romp. It involves a genetically-enhanced leftover from Nazi Germany who plans to hold the world to ransom by destroying everyone else's supply of microchips and therefore cornering the market on their distribution. Now, if you think that you've heard something like that before, then you may be right – Goldfinger used basically the same premise, only with gold instead of microchips. But that was in the past. And it's not like any Bond fan will remember, right? Okay, so the plot may have actually managed to simply be an upgrade of an earlier story, but this was released in the eighties when microchips were really starting to take off. So, if you can forgive that, you should be able to get some fun out of it.Moore's previous film was 'Octopussy.' Now, I didn't hate it as much as most, but even I had to admit that it was probably the most campy Bond film made to date. I'm pleased to say that @A View to a Kill' tones down the silliness in order for a more serious affair. Of course you still get Moore's trademark 'dry wit' along the way, but at least he's stopped making noises like Tarzan when he swings through the jungle! It's actually pretty good, you obviously get everything you expect from a Bond film, i.e. the exotic locations, chase scenes and beautiful women. However, special mention to a pretty awesome rescue/chase section during the middle of the film where Bond has to not only escape from a burning building, but also drive a fire engineer (recklessly) through the streets of San Francisco (kind of like you see later in Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines!). But no Bond films would be anything without a decent villain for our man to go up against. Rumour has it producers wanted Mr David Bowie to take that place, but the Starman appeared uninterested and the role when to the (equally-talented) Christopher Walken. Now, he's pretty awesome in everything he does and in 'A View to a Kill' he's no exception, clearly enjoying playing a complete psychopath. However, I can't help but wonder if the producers wanted Bowie so much that they decided to dress Walken up like him in his 'Let's Dance' video (seriously, once you see it you can UNsee it!).We also have Tanya Roberts as the 'Bond girl' of the film. She does her best with what she's got to do – appropriately getting captured when required and throwing the odd punch here and there. However, if 'A View to a Kill' has a memorable Bond girl then it's Grace Jones! Granted, she may not be everyone's idea of a Bond girl, but she's pretty impressive in her role and cuts a far more memorable figure with everything she has to go through, making her possibly the best 'henchman' since Jaws.As I said, 'A View to a Kill' may not be everyone's vodka martini. Moore is looking a little tired, but it's still an enjoyable enough Bond romp to please most casual fans. Besides, even if you don't like the film, you can't deny that it has the greatest Bond theme ever recorded, courtesy of Duran Duran (if you watch 'A View to a Kill' then I defy you not to be singing it by the end credits!).",A View to a Kill
50,ThomasDrufke,A View Without a Thrill,4,28 October 2015,"The 80's produced several all-time great action films, but A View to a Kill is not one of them. In fact, it's one of the weaker ones. It's unfortunate because this film ends Roger Moore's long 15 year run as everyone's favorite British Secret Service agent. Films have come along way since he began in 1973, but the quality has varied in this franchise. Bond films attempt to go bigger and bigger with every release, but A View to a Kill fails at bringing a more mainstream approach to the series. It's also unfortunate that we have a wasted performance from Christopher Walken, who very well could have been an all time great villain.The action definitely feels bigger, and there are a few notable action scenes that I can see myself re-watching. But the film is poorly paced with an incredibly slow first half. It doesn't help that the first action scene we see is before the opening credits and it's yet another ski chase. Only that this time Bond gets away on a snowboard, how original. Speaking of the opening credits, this film contains one of the better credits songs and the score for the entire film is great. So it's not all bad. Walken plays a horse breeder, yes Bond goes after a horse breeder. The twist on his character was welcomed and it definitely made more sense as to why 007 would be assigned to this case. The problem is, this happens half way through the film, so the first hour or so just seems like an entirely different film. On the other hand, at least they attempted to change up the villain formula from past installments, but Walken's performance never takes off.A strong point for the series often includes strong supporting characters. Unfortunately, none of the women or even men that Bond gets help from prove to be of any relevance. In other words, not enough care is given to them in the script to make us feel sympathy for them when everything hits the fan. So in all, A View to a Kill is another missed opportunity to have a classic film with a classic villain. Once again, there's some entertainment to be had, particularly in the climax, but it doesn't make up for the lackluster first half.+Opening credits theme+John Barry's adjusted score-Wasted role for Walken-Don't care about the supporting characters-slow slow start4.8/10",A View to a Kill

Bond is assigned to foil a wealthy industrialists plot to destroy California's Silicon Valley.Best Performance: Roger Moore Worst Performance: Grace Jones",A View to a Kill
54,CuriosityKilledShawn,What a view!,8,1 October 2006,"Okay, I'm going to lose a lot of fans by saying that I really liked Roger Moore as James Bond - he was the quintessential 007. However, by the time Moore got to View To A Kill, he was definitely looking like a tired old warhorse. He was approximately 175-years-old during the filming of AVTAK and it shows. Moore is quite happy to let his stunt double do the hard work while he occasionally performs in front of rear projection at Pinewood. Even his ""hot young sidekick"" Patrick Macnee celebrated his 200th birthday on set and Lois Maxwell as Moneypenny was well into her second century. Despite a combined cast age that could could reach back to the dawn on mankind there's enough fun in this installment to balance it out, thankfully.Christopher Walken stars as Max Zorin (a role originally intended for David Bowie), a purebred Nazi baby all grown up into a psychotic capitalist madman. He plans on destroying the key geological lock underneath the San Andreas Fault, resulting in a massive flood that will drown Silicon Valley, thus allowing him to corner the ""chip market"".Throughout the course of the story, Bond involves himself in a number of set pieces and makes the odd joke or two. There's a neat scene of a Ruskie being chucked into a big fan, a memorable firetruck chase and the showdown on Golden Gate Bridge that feels like a natural climax instead of having the landmark shoved in for some 9/11 porn like so many other movies these days. It has very little to do with Ian Fleming's story, retaining the French setting before shifting to California, where it almost becomes a completely different movie.All the Bond clichés are here - the practically meaningless title, the encounter with the bad guy before there are any hard feelings, the bad girl who is either tamed or a double-crosser, the shy girl who is driven wild by Bond's double entendres, though the gadgets are played-down for the most part.If you're a fan of the contemporary Bonds, it might feel a little jarring going from overrated Daniel Craig bedding the ladies, to a leathery octogenarian Moore, bedding shrieking androgynous Amazonian Grace Jones for no apparent reason. That scene has always been rather uneasy on the eye, but I can see the appeal in her.John Glen is a veteran of the world according to Ian Fleming. Nowadays, every movie is directed by someone new in order to keep a fresh perspective, but they all look the same when there are no explosions, or car chases (such scenes are directed by second unit anyway). Glen keeps a balance between the plot and the action that is believable and frequently exciting. The Panavision photography looks amazing and has many simply gorgeous wide shots. John Barry's score is naturally brilliant, but I am undecided if this or Living Daylights in his best Bond work.This Moore's last hurrah before handing over to Timothy Dalton, and, despite the hate, it was a good movie to go out on.",A View to a Kill

57,The-Sarkologist,Not One of the Franchise's Best,5,16 December 2019,"Honestly, I really can't get the song out of my head, though that probably has something to do with me still remembering when it was blasted out all over the radio, and also that it happened to be performed by Duran Duran, not so much one of my favourite bands, but a band that does bring me back memories of when I was much younger. Yet on the other hand it sort of wasn't anywhere near one of my favourites either.I guess I could give you a brief run down on what it was about, but the thing is that a part of me does feel that a lot of them start to get rather similar. In a way, this story felt as it run just like the previous couple of films, especially the last one. You know, they start of in some exotic place, sort of uncover a place, and then head off somewhere else where they suddenly have to prevent a huge bomb from going off - this was the case with Octopussy, and this is definitely the case with this film.Then there is the ending, which sort of felt a little forced, namely because it seemed as since this was a Bond film, and they were in San Francisco, then they might as well have the final fight occur on the Golden Gate Bridge. In a way it almost seems as if that is something that just needs to be done, especially when we are dealing with action films (though of course since the Bond franchise is technically British, then we can't necessarily consider them to be Hollywood movies). In any event though, a part of me just felt that there wasn't all that much that set this apart from some of the other ones.However, that doesn't necessarily mean that this was a particular bad film - by no means. In fact, it was a rather enjoyable film to be honest with you. Yet, even then, as I mentioned, it is basically just another bond film, and you probably know what you are going to get with a Bond film, which is probably why then ended up doing as well as they did (and still actually do).",A View to a Kill

59,slightlymad22,"So Much Wrong With This One, But Walken & Jones Shine",3,9 March 2020,"A View To A KillSadly my biggest problem with this movie is Roger Moore. When this was made, he was 57, 5 years older than Connery (who played a retired 007) in Never Say Never Again. Something about face looks really off here (I don't know if he's had some work done) and he just does not look believable in the few action scenes he actually does (it looks like your grandad knocking out weightlifters with one punch) so most of it is left to awful, obvious stuntmen (they don't even try and hide them) and front and rear projection. The less said about his wooing of the women the better. It also has the worst Bond girl ever Stacey (Tanya Roberts) who is nothing but a screaming damsel in distress for Bond to constantly save.Obvious miniatures and studio sets mixed with real footage really cheapen the feel of this one and it's a shame as it does have some good things going for it. Christopher Walken is great as is Grace Jones (they are the best things in the movie) and Duran Duran's title song is great. That said The Beach Boys Surfin USA is ridiculously out of place.It's funny I have whinged about Moore looking so out of place in this movie, as in more modern movies Tom Cruise is still more believable doing crazy things in Mission Impossible movies, Liam Neeson was 56 when he made the first Taken, Connery was 66 when he kicked all kinds of ass in The Rock and Sly was 64 in the first Expendables ten years ago.In a year when Back To The Future, Rocky 4 and Rambo 2 dominated.

61,Rodrigo_Amaro,Even with its imperfections this is still a great Bond movie.,10,24 July 2012,"""Skyfall"" is coming with Daniel Craig again as the new and ultra serious Bond so what's better than to take a look at the Bond classics and revisit some really great moments? ""A View to a Kill"" marked Roger Moore's last film as 007 (a forced exercise to him, since he was hoping that ""For Your Eyes Only"" would be his final), not much of a great exit but still a fun thing to watch. My evaluation of this film comes in light of how Bond series changed through the years, stuck with some aspects, characters, situations, his eternal drink, and why even the funniest flicks of the agent still are slightly better than the ones we're seeing now. It's a generation thing, I grew up watching those films and they were a lot of fun. I know the whole change behind the longest franchise so far (let me know if there's any other...) was to gather a new audience and maybe preserve the oldest, just like the Batman reboot started brilliantly with Christopher Nolan, and many other franchises went along. But that didn't meant quality in the Bond case. Fine, the oldest ones like ""A View to a Kill"" were ridiculously in its editing, you can clearly see the stunt double changing places with Moore or Connery, or whoever is playing Bond, and it's very funny and a little bit over-the-top but they were fun, amazing, pleasant to watch. Now, all we have is dramatic parts, a certain reluctance in acting (this never works in Bond films, take a look at George Lazenby only instance), an agent with so much feelings. I liked the movies but didn't enjoyed them so much (Q is going to return, so let's see, difficult to replace the irreplaceable Desmond Llewelyn).Enough with the comparisons, let's see what ""A View to a Kill"" is all about. 007's mission is to investigate the eccentric Max Zorin (an blonde Christopher Walken) and his enigmatic Zorin Industries and the masterplan that involves the destruction of the Silicon Valley. And Bond is escorted by Stacey Sutton (Tanya Roberts, you all know her from ""That 70's Show"" as Donna's mom) and May Day (the diva Grace Jones), Zorin's partner and a woman of many talents. Among the action sequences, highlight to the chase at the Eiffel Tower and the fight on the blip flying over San Francisco, where it also happens a strange car chase that looks more suitable on a Police Academy movie than in a Bond movie. There's excitement and good moments overall, some forced moments and an almost empty plot when it comes to the villainy committed (just a psycho who wants to sink Silicon Valley? We could have more). Don't even get me started on how bad edited some sequences were (the car chase in Paris, it's unbelievable how close they were from the stunt double, obviously not Moore driving that ""half car"") or even endure with Roberts sexy hoarse voice all the time calling ""James!"" (priceless!), far from being perfect. But who cares? This is so much fun, highly entertaining, it's always a pleasure to see Moore as Bond (the funniest and in a good way!) and there's the best theme song ever in a Bond movie, Duran Duran's title song (the video clip is even better, with the band members at the Eiffel tower, mixing scenes with 007 chasing the mysterious killer).You can't miss this! 10/10",A View to a Kill
62,johnnyboyz,"Strained blend of cartoonish aesthetics with a general sense of menace; Moore starred in better and Glen made better, this hovers somewhere around what's not acceptable.",5,15 November 2011,"The precredits sequence is where we begin with A View to a Kill, as is standard for the Bond movies; in this one, he is infiltrating an icy area nowhere-Siberia so as to find and recover a small microchip another double-0 agent had attained before being killed. Bond does so, as is expected, and upon finding it hidden in a pendulum the guy wore around his neck, tosses aside the picture of his wife and child for the real reason Roger Moore's hero is even there. Such an action epitomises this edition, the film that signalled the end of Moore's seven film tenure and around about the peak period of Glen's tenure at the helm appears as a whole lot more interested in casually placing to the side the heartfelt and humane characteristics of the predicament for business as usual, business encapsulated by that chip. Following this, there is a brief skirmish during which Bond manages to find his way back to an Allied rendez-vous point through snow and ice, via canted angles out of the sun that come complete with lens flare as he snowboards over ridges to The Beach Boys, before getting out of dodge in the company of one of MI6's more luscious-looking Navy employees.The opening encapsulates the fact that the film is a bit of a cartoon, a weak comic book adventure with the odd glowing moment. I'd be lying if I said there wasn't some fun to be had out of some of the film's second unit work - the often pumping Barry score, which combines old fashioned orchestral bursts with then-contemporary discharges of electric guitar, is often good value and the narrative is a lot easier to keep up when compared to some of Moore's previous entries. It is, however, mostly disappointing – the moment the film arrives in San Fransisco and laments upon us the J.W. Pepper of The Sunshine State in Joe Flood's SFPD police Captain, plus badly executed comedic cop car chase, the moment it shoots its bolt and misses.Things kick off in earnest when Bond makes it back to London following the opening only to be greeted by some laborious exposition on the situation. Following this, everybody darts off to the races - a sequence allowing a certain Max Zorin (Walken) to be introduced via another avalanche of exposition and firmly reiterating we're not anywhere near the domains of something like 1976's Marathon Man, which took time and effort in creating a character behind Olivier's villain through its props and setting and such. It is revealed Zorin is heavier into the world of horse racing than most; a billionaire businessman, and after some brief romping around on the Continent, Bond heads to his remote agricultural domain of well dressed patrons and racing studs in order to infiltrate and deduce whilst under the guise of a wealthy Englishman (complete with indelible alias) to investigate.Armed with a side-kick named Tibbett (Macnee), Bond uncovers a sordid plot to do with the scientific experimentation on horses that allows them to win most races they enter; if we didn't already feel those throngs of mistrust and menace about Walken's character, the fact he abuses animals ought to be enough to pine to a side of the audience which sways them into somewhat despising him. At the festivities, and as Bond's guise of cover begins to come under threat, we observe separate fight scenes instigated by both Moore's character, which he wins easily, and that of his adversary Zorin whose aggressive girlfriend May Day (Jones) is beaten in man-to-man combat alluding to a common, equal combative link. As is often the case, something Bond investigates, which is seemingly small and features an eccentric tycoon up to no good, expands into something a lot larger. Here, Zorin's plan is dealt out to cohorts and the audience alike in a fashion akin to the villain of Goldfinger in the film entitled as such as a room full of business partners get the low down away from one lone individual's request to be cut adrift, a lone individual who is expansively eliminated. The plan is more broadly linked to flooding a stretch of Earth which he believes will eliminate cooperate opposition.Mixed in is a reasonably fun sub-plot to do with Zorin having turned his back on the KGB, of whom created him and nurtured him out of certain sordid scientific backgrounds echoing that of what he does to his race horses. Their own war that they wage on him offers some meek support to Bond fumbling through the motions and this plot reaches a bit of a crescendo when our hero steals some vital information on the case from a Russian agent equivalent of whom he recognises from some years back, but we are not even granted the trivial thrill of it being someone along the lines of Barbara Bach's Soviet agent from The Spy Who Love Me, which it could so easily and realistically been. Popping up is Tanya Roberts' Stacey Sutton and her subplot revolving around Zorin, a Californian native playing Bond's screaming blonde damsel to Zorin's dominatrix May Day; a woman who's strong and independent in the male dominated working zones of America's West Coast but struggles in the department of hard bodiedness when faced with taking Zorin down physically - a character desperately needing some of the vitality expressed by For Your Eyes Only's Melina Havelock. The film is not without its fair share of engagement but lacks an overall sense of competence; it is interesting, in hindsight and having seen Moore's Bond films afresh, that those which focused on Cold War elements are the better ones, with excursions off to stop cooperate billionaires and outcasts making a nuisance of things alá Moonraker or The Man With the Golden Gun falling a little flat. Here is another, a flakey and flimsy adventure rounding off a sporadically successful stretch for Moore and the series as a whole.",A View to a Kill

Wilson and is the fourteenth film in the franchise. In this film, besides the central cast inherited from the previous films and the ending of Roger Moore in the role of 007, we have a good cast of artists: Tanya Roberts plays the Bond-girl Stacey Sutton, Patrick Macnee gives life to Sir Godfrey Tibbett, Grace Jones gives life to May Day and Christopher Walken gave body and soul to mad Max Zorin. For the last time, Lois Maxwell played Miss Moneypenny, after fourteen movies giving life to M's secretary.In this film, James Bond investigates a fraud in the world of horse racing involving Max Zorin, a powerful businessman. However, the British agent will quickly find a much more dangerous and malevolent conspiracy behind it.This is the last film in which Roger Moore embodies the secret agent. Despite the undoubted talent, the actor was already too old for the role and it was time to pass the baton to a new generation. Nevertheless, Moore stood firm until the end, always maintained a correct posture and took his Bond until the end, with the dignity of a true British. The script could be much more convincing: it's a bit strange that Bond, an agent who already got used to save the world, was investigating such a common fraud as doping in equestrian races to, quite naturally, tripping over a global conspiracy against the mecca of technology production. And even if that were to happen, there would certainly simpler ways to achieve that than the way, contrived and complicated, chose by the villain. In any case, the film is good enough, even if not extraordinary: it entertains the audience, allows a good time and not disappoint Bond fans.

But come on, when a spy film contains the line ""the bubbles tickle my...Tchaikovsky!!"" you just have to roll over and give into the sheer stupidity that is onscreen. Roger Moore was past his sell by date so it was only right that this was his last entry. He couldn't do any of the easier stunts, like hand-to-hand combat, let alone the driving scenes. His womanising talents are still supreme though...not sure if that's a good thing. Christopher Walken laughs like a maniac and Grace Jones is the manliest beast as she portrays May Day, a villainous sidekick that would give Jaws a run for his money. No special gadgety from Q Branch except a robot dog that acts as a gag in the final minute. A blimp that flies around which leads to an underwhelming yet badass showdown atop of the Golden Gate Bridge. Horses injected with steroids, base jumping from the Eiffel Tower, a mine in Sili...wait a blimp!? What use is a blimp!? The most impractical use of transportation ever! You know what? I don't even care, this film is a good time. The soundtrack is great, Glen's direction is perfectly solid and the story is well paced. Weak? Sure. The worst? Probably. Entertaining? You betcha.

They pretty much steal this film from right under Bond's nose. They have all the best scenes.Hits all the spots that you would expect and hits them well.Who doesn't love a supervillain and no franchise does it better than Bond and in this film its delivered splendidly.Hard not to have fun watching this :)",A View to a Kill

(I think he is fed up with the geeks n nerds).Apart from Zorin none of the henchmen are noteworthy.This one's a bit violentThe main villain Zorin, a sadistic psychopath (played smoothly by Christopher Walken) displays a near-total lack of loyalty to his own men n shoots hundreds of people with machine guns n that too with a smile.A man gets minced in an underwater exhaust fan.In this movie Bond does an amazing horse hurdle race.It has a lovely pre credit scene of that of a breathtaking ski chase.It has a spectacular chase up and down the Eiffel Tower which must have inspired the parkour chase sequence in Casino Royale.The climactic fight scene on Golden Gate Bridge is very well done.This movie is Dolph Lundgren's first on-screen role, playing General Gogol's KGB bodyguard Venz but without any dialogues.He is present before the iconic dialogue, ""No one ever leaves the KGB"".In this movie Bond gets to cool off with Mary Stavin, Fiona Fullerton, Tanya Roberts n Grace Jones
(A true Amazonian female n better than the fake Gal Gadot. Grace Jones was the first sexually aggressive Bond girl, evidenced by her reversal of positions - she climbed on top).Many fellas say that Muad Adams is present in the movie as an extra n uncredited of that of a passerby. I tried but didn't notice her.Some info on Zorin:
Max Zorin is a sharp businessman, operating on the microchip market. He is highly intelligent n acts very fast cos he is the product of a Nazi medical experimentation during World War II, in which pregnant women were injected with massive quantities of steroids in an attempt to create ""super-children."" Most of the pregnancies failed while the few surviving babies grew to become extraordinarily intelligent-but also psychopathic.After the war, Hans Glaub aka Carl Mortner, the German scientist who conducted the experiments, raised a young Zorin. Zorin was later trained by KGB agents.",A View to a Kill
68,Movie_Muse_Reviews,"Lots of distinctive features, but more of the same, plus a tonal mess",4,14 April 2019,"""Ad absurdum"" would best characterize the state of Eon Productions' ""James Bond"" franchise by this point in the mid-'80s. Sir Roger Moore, at age 57, has nothing more to give to 007. He, director John Glen, writers Richard Maibaum and Michael G. Wilson, and even Albert R. Broccoli (though probably unaware of it at age 75 or so) are going through the motions in ""A View to a Kill."" They just do everything they can to make the same formulaic story look and feel new.This was also the state of things in 1983's ""Octopussy,"" but the difference is that film embraced its wild, colorful absurdity; there's a chunk of ""A View to a Kill"" that wants to be a serious action film. Another way of looking at it: the ability of this film to balance humor and wit with espionage is seriously dysfunctional.The story tries to bring Bond into the technology era with a plot involving a microchip that leads to the second-half action taking place in San Francisco. Although that may be future-minded, Glen's direction continues to feel dated. The amount of implied brutal violence gets taken up a notch, perhaps in recognition of the kinds of action films being made at this time, but there lots of '60s-style fist fights, bad Foley sound and all. ""A View to a Kill"" has no identity in this sense, offering a stunning Eiffel Tower chase and jump in one scene, and a goofy firetruck getaway in another. Both show an effort to be inventive, but they land so differently.Moore doesn't phone it in here, but he's got no chemistry with Tanya Roberts, whose character is so unbelievable even if it weren't matched by her terrible performance. One of the underrated choices of ""Octopussy"" was to cast a female lead in Maud Adams that was at least close to Moore's age (17 years younger) and whose character had some experience. This compares to Roberts (27 years younger), Fiona Fullerton (28 years younger) and Alison Doody (38 years younger). Timothy Dalton should've just been Bond at this point.Casting an Oscar winner in Christopher Walken as the villain might've gone over well had the character not been all over the map. He's got the personality of every Bond villain rolled into one, with an extra dose of crazy. The script tries to paint him as terrifying because he's unpredictable, but doesn't give him enough to work with. May Day (Grace Jones) is by far the most creative and risky of all the evil sidekicks cast in the series over the years, and she's exciting to watch, but ultimately she's just a henchwoman in a ""Bond"" movie-the formula doesn't allow that much wiggle room.""A View to a Kill"" stands out among the ""Bond"" library for a number of its choices. The Zorin blimp, Christopher Walken, May Day, the Golden Gate Bridge, horseracing-the distinctive features are abundant. Maibaum and Wilson have good ideas, they just keep applying them to the same story structure-probably because that's what they were paid to do. Perhaps out of chronological context, it's no better or worse than most of the Moore era, but watching them chronologically, there's undeniable fatigue. Add that to a film with humor and high stakes that take to each other like oil and water, and there's little arguing that ""A View to a Kill"" is one of the franchise's biggest misses.~Steven CThanks for reading!

70,Anonymous_Maxine,007 entering the computerized age,8,5 November 2008,"Dr. No, the original 007 film, was basically a murder mystery, so whenever I see a Bond film like A View to A Kill, I am always struck by how far the series has come and how much bigger the stories get. In this installment, we get a truly evil, classic Bond-style villain with Max Zorin (played by a wonderfully nefarious Christopher Walken - who looks exactly like Luscious Malfoy, by the way), with a truly evil, classic master plan.The movie starts with Bond on a mission in the Soviet Union where he narrowly escapes after recovering a microchip off the snow-bound body of another British agent. There is a great ski chase in the movie's opening scene as he's pursued by the Russians, but at one point, the song ""California Girls"" comes on for about a minute and then fades out just as suddenly. I'm going to go ahead and say that this must be the most out of place piece of music in any James Bond film ever made.It seems that the microchip that he recovered is a ""silicon integrated unit"" capable of triggering a magnetic pulse and blowing out everything that uses a similar chip, which would include anything from toasters to the most advanced computers. I didn't know toasters were computerized in the mid-1980s (are they now?), but needless to say, a nuclear explosion over England would short out the entire country, destroying their national defenses and rendering the entirety of their population completely toast-less. The British have a computer chip that is impervious to all magnetic pulse damage, and Bond's mission is to find out how the Soviets have managed to get a hold of an exact copy of one.An investigation of a suspicious horse-race gambling circuit leads to Max Zorin (also the maker of the original chip), who is suspected of selling the design to the Russians. But of course, starting a war between the British and the Russians is not nearly enough, Zorin plans to create an underground earthquake in California, sink the entire Silicon Valley and corner the market on all computer manufacturing!I think it's safe to say that the plot of this particular movie is years ahead of its time. If Zorin had succeeded in his plan, no one would have known that he had created the earthquake, and he would now be the most powerful man in the universe. His sidekick, May Day, is played by Jamaican actress Grace Jones, who is best known for doing scary roles like this one. I'm not sure what the deal was with her hair in this movie, but they definitely went overboard a few times. There is one point in the film where it looks like it was sculpted to look exactly like Batman's ears. Who comes up with this stuff?Nevertheless, she is one of the better female Bond villains (and a rare example of genuine character development and change), as is Walken's Max Zorin. In order to raise money for his take-over of the computer market, he has devised a scheme where he implants devices into race-horses that time injections of horse steroids, so that they aren't detected in pre-race blood tests. Pretty clever, but it's the design of that underground earthquake that really takes the cake. It's so good that it even provided the inspiration of an episode of ""Ducktales!""There is some depth added to the characters of Zorin and May Day near the end of the film as well when it is revealed that Zorin is ex-KGB and, if it weren't for them, he and May Day would now be nothing but walking biological experiments. We never learn exactly what is meant by this, but it doesn't matter. There is a great chase through the streets of Sa Francisco and a thrilling finale atop the Golden Gate Bridge. Love it or hate it, this is definitely vintage Bond.Note: A disclaimer at the beginning of the movie informs us that ""Neither the name Zorin nor any other name or character in this film is meant to portray a real company or actual person."" What about the KGB?",A View to a Kill
71,elshikh4,Horrible Horrible Bond !,5,19 May 2008,"Why this movie is provocatively nasty?Let's begin with the opening sequence. It repeats its like in (The Spy Who Loved Me - 1977), for (Moore) also, yet so weakly. Originally, since when do they repeat the opening sequences in movies that used to excel at making matchless intros?!!The plot was formulaic, so I hated that most of the events felt recycled from another Bond movies, some of them were for (Moore) himself. And talking about hate; Bond's cover here was discovered in a very idiot way. This undoubtedly was the script's lowest point and shameful insult to the supposedly high profile 007!(Moore) seemed so old and weary to do action or seduce women. He was 58 year old at the time, but strangely enough he looked older. At the action sequences, he wasn't believable, especially with a very visible stunt for him all the time. Simply this round, (Moore) lost the persuasion!This is the only movie for Bond which required from him having a homosexual experience, since I don't consider (Grace Jones) a woman in the first place! Casting her as an evil Bond girl was historical fatal mistake, one of the stupidest decisions I've ever witnessed, and a lousy try to attract the pervert audience. She seemed, with those creepy costumes and that awful haircut, more like ""The Bogeywoman"". Honestly, I've had some time till I became convinced of her as not a MAN!(Lois Maxwell) as (Moneypenny) was 58 year old, so any sexual innuendo was near to bad tasting. And (Tanya Roberts) was frigid, with no role to act.(John Barry)'s music was surely the movie's best. The title's song was superb, but maybe too young for that Bond. The action sequences were very good; the thing is they leaned to feeling exhausted and fake; for example, the climactic sequence was overtly exposed as something done in a studio. (John Glen), who directed 5 Bond movies, made sparkling image, but with no charm. And (Christopher Walken) was one talented factor as maybe the craziest evil man appeared in a Bond movie, though it was lost performance at a movie that wasn't forgettable inasmuch as being better forgotten!So, with old plot, old Bond, ugly cold Bond girls, and fake action, you have to know why (A View to a Kill) is provocatively nasty. It is run-down, at my list of the worst bond movies, and with (Grace Jones) they should have called it ""A View That killed Us""!",A View to a Kill

The 70s, by 1985, were long over and Moore was clearly the 70s era 007. The mood, the atmosphere, the silliness, the feel of 007 needed to change and we still had 70s Bond in 85.And then, Moore himself looked kind of like Bond in his 70s. He was far too old for the role. Too old to be believable as a super spy. Too old fit the part, and needed to pass on the mantel a few films ago.By 85 the Silly Bond Era needed to end.

74,FilmCriticLalitRao,A view to a kill : Actor Roger Moore's final film as agent 007.,8,17 September 2015,"After the success of 'Octopussy', it was felt that actor Roger Moore should continue winning ways of James Bond. Nobody had any idea that 'A view to a kill' would turn out to be his last film as British agent James Bond. After this film, Timothy Dalton was chosen to represent James Bond on the big screen. This is something which his loyal fans and other admirers of this series must bear in mind while watching this Bond flick where American actor Christopher Walken appears as a highly dangerous, psychopathic villain with a smile on his face who set his mind on destroying America's Silicon valley. Actor Roger Moore doesn't disappoint a bit as James Bond continues to move from one place to another in order to gather valuable information about the villain's nefarious plans. However, it is through sudden twists and turns of events that Bond achieves final victory over the villain. There are times when even a villain can also be more popular than a hero. This is depicted in Christopher Walken's performance as Zorin, a shrewd businessman with stakes in an expensive stable. Actor Christopher Walken dominates this film to a huge extent. It is his arrogance which brings his downfall. When this film was being made, there was absolutely no link between horses and a silicon valley as 1985 was too early a period to speak about the destruction of 'Silicon Valley'. However, the inventiveness of the script ensured that even such an idea was practical. This is one of the film's key strengths.",A View to a Kill
75,drqshadow-reviews,"Silly, Exaggerrated Action That Skews the Careful Balance Seen in Bond's Better Efforts",3,26 April 2012,"The climax of Roger Moore's seven-picture run as the world's most notorious gentleman spy. For my money, Moore's take on the character is at the bottom of the pile, for a variety of reasons that are on proud display in this clunky, weak chapter. Though his face-off with Christopher Walken and Grace Jones in Silicon Valley isn't quite as relentlessly cheesy and absurdly slapstick as 1979's Moonraker, my candidate for the weakest Bond, the two do have an awful lot in common thematically. What bothers me most is its constantly dopey attitude: always after the cheap gag or bad punchline, it thankfully stops just short of implementing a rimshot or laugh track. It's not like puns and cracks are strangers to the franchise - in fact, that's always been a part of their charm - but there's a point in the middle of Moore's run where the balance tipped and Bond's audience-aimed winks became more important than his spy work and lady-wrangling. View to a Kill also suffers from a distinct shortage of gadgetry, which makes it feel more generic and even less like a Bond adventure. Moore looks positively ancient in many scenes - a 57-year-old man nailing stunts and ladies that would stretch the imagination for a star half his age - and Walken is an appropriately maniacal if not particularly imaginative foil. A drizzling farewell that left me wishing the franchise had moved on to greener pastures much earlier.",A View to a Kill

He also steals a horse, shoots down a helicopter, invents snow boarding, hijacks a truck full of dynamite, jams a drilling rig, replays the ""inside job"" massacre at San Francisco's City Hall, crashes a wedding, bests Evel Knievel's top vehicle jump, straddles the point of the TransAmerica Building, and saves Silicon Valley. (Almost sounds like Bauer. Jack Bauer.) Roger Moore is back for his seventh and final crack at Bond. Though Electro-Magnetic Pulse resistant (or EMP-proof) microchips are the initial ""MacGuffin"" of this yarn, that tech angle is soon dropped in favor of rehashing the same storyline of the previous Bond flick, OCTOPU$$Y. The renegade Russian is reduced in rank from ""General"" Orlov to ""Agent"" Zorin. Since Orlov never had his own blimp, Christopher Walken as ""Zorin"" probably doesn't feel too slighted here.

It marked Roger Moore's final appearance as 007 and tips its hat to THE AVENGERS by casting Patrick McNee as Moore's sidekick.

Walken and Jones make one of the best pair of villains since Christopher Lee and Herve Villachaize in THE MAN WITH THE GOLDEN GUN.

The plot of the movie is quite different but execution is not that great, the length of the movie is another concern as the movie could've been cut short by at least half hour.Acting was decent but Roberts was a disappointment. Screenplay is slow and could've been made more gripping. Locations are good and cinematography is good. Climax is very long and viewers might get bored with such long climax.Overall not a perfect adieu for Mr. Moore. Movie can be watched once.",A View to a Kill

I liked Sean Connery in the role more, though Moore did star in my favourite so far in 'The Man with the Golden Gun'.

81,JoeKarlosi,A View to a Kill (1985) ***,7,29 November 2006,"For a very long time I'd always listed this James Bond film as the very ""worst"" of the franchise at the rock bottom slot, but all that has changed for me with a recent reappraisal. While it will never enjoy a spot among my own personal Top Ten list, it's far from the least of the series and I've come to think of it as, while not great, certainly underrated.The biggest problem right out of the gate is Roger Moore's age. When he made this movie, which turned out to be his final of seven films as Bond, he was well over the hill at age 57. In between making the last film, OCTOPUSSY, and this one, Sir Roger supposedly had a face lift. As a result, he looks quite bizarre at times walking around in a sparkling white suit with his eyes often bugging about wide open in a virtual look of surprise as he goes undercover and announces himself with a beaming grin as ""James St. John Smythe!"". But much to Moore's credit, once you get past that initial impression, his commitment to the role and his own patented brand of James Bond - charming, witty, and professional - helps you forget about his advancing years to the point where you don't even think of it. Just imagine it's like Bond on his last mission, prior to retirement.Christopher Walken, reportedly a big Bond fan himself, gets to play the villainous Max Zorin. Bond goes to Walken's private mansion to investigate a shady horse racing ring when he discovers that Zorin is hoarding a tremendous stockpile of microchips. Much similar to the plot of GOLDFINGER (where Goldfinger intended to take over the world's gold supply) here Zorin hopes to destroy California's Silicon Valley and thus become the sole supplier of the world's microchip market. Walken is an interesting nemesis for Bond, with a strange and ironic origin. His dangerous and athletic henchwoman May Day is played by the bizarre-looking Grace Jones, and as a strong woman with an uncomfortably androgynous manner about her, she makes for an unusual change of pace baddie.The Bond girl this time is played by former Charlie's Angel Tanya Roberts, and there isn't much to say about her after you get to admire her stunning beauty. She doesn't have much to do in the part of Stacey Sutton, who is more or less just your typical damsel in distress for much of the movie once she meets up with James Bond. Patrick Macnee (of ""The Avengers"" TV series) is a welcome addition to the lineup as a mock chauffeur to Bond, and it's a lot of fun seeing Macnee and Moore together with Roger having a chance to tease him in their scenes together.The other biggest problems with A VIEW TO A KILL, if you're successfully able to go along with Roger Moore being nearly 60, are some ridiculous comical scenes here and there. The first is during the pre-title segment where Bond is surfing in the snow to the soundtrack of the Beach Boys' ""California Girls"" (!). Another horror is a fire engine chase sequence late in the film where 007 is left hanging helplessly on the truck's swinging ladder while whining and crying out like someone from out of an old Keystone Kops comedy. But in the end, these are just eye-rolling moments in an otherwise interesting and presentable James Bond adventure. This is not a film to write home about, but it's more entertaining than it's typically given credit for, and before I go I should add that the theme song as sung by the '80s group Duran Duran is one of the best in the series. *** out of ****",A View to a Kill

Did some one year old kid come up with this title? Okay, so its the worst title ever of any movie. Get past that, and what have you got? The events in the movie are very Bond like, and there is a lot of effort going into stunts and storyboards, but none into plot and character. Walken is obviously an evil business tycoon. No, wait, he's a hit man for the Soviets. No, wait, he's a genetically engineered creature. There are a lot of good ideas that never materialize or make sense. One idea is the idea of genetically altering a race horse. There are so many ways horsemen could fool the industry, and this is one, where a horse can be altered from a sprinter to a distance runner. But the like the other ideas, it is not elaborated on one bit. Just mentioned and never goes any where. The characters are clichéd, so its not fair to scrutinize the actors. The director probably should have given more leeway to making this a comic Bond movie, which in essence most Bond movies do to help you accept the ridiculous scenes. Such as in another Bond movie where Bond and Jaws fall through the sky without parachutes and land alive-but the audience accepts this because of the comic attitude. This movie lacks such an attitude, and fails miserably. To judge it against all movies, not just Bond movies, it may have registered a 3 or 4, but the title and the horrible song (easily the worst Bond song ever), lowers it further. Most Bond songs have some rock quality or beat or inspiration. This one has absolutely no rock, and is totally bluesy. If you like fingernails on chalkboards, you may like this song, but most people have enough pain in their lives, and watch movies to get away from it. Total waste.

For once he seems miserable at tossing off one of those token Moore-isms of his, like ""there's a fly in your soup"" when a contact of his is murdered by a poisoned butterfly.A self-conscious Roger Moore is not a good start for a Bond film, and it gets worse. The plot, something to do with a microchip maker's plan to destroy his competition by flooding Silicon Valley, gets out of hand early with a goofy horse-doping subplot that disappears an hour in. The direction by John Glen is ugly and uninspired, presenting an overall texture that strives to be both gritty and goofy and winds up a mess. Even John Barry's theme music sounds at times like a hollow ""On Her Majesty's Secret Service"" retread.Tanya Roberts and Grace Jones are fine physical specimens who can't act a lick between them. ""We're not sure about her"" is the first line about Jones' exotic May Day character, and after 22 years, I can't say I'm farther along than that. Roberts' Stacey Sutton screams and wears tight clothing, obviously not concerned for a moment about being mistaken for a serious actress.Christopher Walken unlocks the puzzle of how to succeed in such a bad movie by treating it as a total joke. His Max Zorin, the bad guy, is such a psychopath he kills his underlings for pure kicks and even tells the KGB where to get off. Walken wasn't known in the mid-'80s for his gonzo comedy stylings, so maybe this was a coming-out party for the cowbell side of his nature. Flip, smirking, he seems to enjoy himself whether he's winning or losing.""May Day will provide you with a drink"", he tells one unfortunate before his girl tosses him into the Pacific. ""Anyone else want to drop out?""Most of the action setpieces are undercut by bad comedy, like an unfortunate fistfight in a factory where assailants are dumped on conveyor lines and turned into boxes. A fight in Stacey's house does manage to amuse and capture some of the old Bond spirit, and the finale on a blimp atop the Golden Gate Bridge is actually rather terrific.Patrick Macnee is even on hand as a 007 helper, alas not long enough. The problem though is more about overstaying one's welcome. Moore looks bored and jaded, while Lois Maxwell's Moneypenny, in her 14th and last Bond film, appears more matronly than ever dressed in an Easter bonnet to see Zorin at the Ascot horse races. Always good when MI6 has the secretaries helping with the field work.There are fun moments amid the stupidity and chaos of ""View To A Kill"". It's not as terrible as ""Die Another Day"", anyway. But it represents a sad exit for this viewer's favorite Bond actor.",A View to a Kill
85,I_Ailurophile,"A bit of a mixed bag, but more good than bad",7,29 June 2021,"Especially compared to most other films in the James Bond franchise, I've long held 'A view to a kill' in relative esteem. That said, it had been a couple years since I last saw this, so I was due for another rewatch. It still holds up - mostly - though in retrospect is a bit more irksome than I'd last recalled.The Bond name carries a lot of baggage with it, and the success of films depends in no small part on if or how they engage with the torrid excesses. 'A view to a kill' fares alright, but also doesn't get away unscathed.The less than credible gadgets of Q Branch are all but absent from this entry, save for an arbitrary small robot that only appears twice - at the very beginning and the very end, and with no purpose save for one last gag before the credits roll. Bond's womanizing is portrayed with no particular sense of purpose, mostly relying on cheap one-liners, visual gags, or eye-rolling flirtations. Of four women he sleeps with in this movie, one tryst is cheap and unnecessary, two are somewhat clever maneuvers to advance the agenda of his mission, and one - the romance with this movie's requisite ""Bond girl"" - is just unconvincing.And then there are the action sequences, which historically are very over the top, and 'A view to a kill' is a bit all over the place. The opening scene, before the credits, may have been passable - if not for the frankly obscene, cheeky insertion of the Beach Boys' ""California girls"" over top. Most of the later nighttime sequence in San Francisco, effectively marking the end of the second act, is simply tiresome, especially as it's punctuated frequently with cries for help from Bond girl Stacey Sutton (Tanya Roberts). Whether fights or chase scenes, much of the movie otherwise is reasonably solid. The climax is a bit on the ridiculous side, but fun and sufficiently credible, and for every bit of charged excitement in the picture, there's a lot of sneaky fact-gathering, too.Overall the narrative is pretty well built, with some especially noteworthy moments scattered throughout. The villain's plot is more realistic than others 007 has foiled - essentially boiling down to an expression of capitalism in its purest form - and suitable as foundation for an action-adventure film. The antagonists, and most of the supporting characters, are written fairly well, and the globetrotting that's become a trope of the series is less far-fetched than in other entries.I'm given to understand that there were difficulties among and between the cast and producers with this movie. It doesn't necessarily show, though Roger Moore's lack of enthusiasm for 'A view to a kill' comes across to a small extent in his performance. It's regrettable that this ended up being Roberts' most significant role, as Stacey Sutton wasn't written especially well. She is little more than a damsel in distress, which is particularly aggravating as a viewer since there are tiny hints elsewhere in the screenplay that she could - and should - have been granted greater agency, more akin to Melina Havelock in 'For your eyes only.'Still, otherwise the cast is pretty great. Christopher Walken's unmistakable visage and characteristic delivery makes villain Max Zorin's casual menace and penchant for violence all the more unsettling. Grace Jones lights up the screen with her best thousand-yard stare as Zorin's chief goon, May Day, and it's a real joy to watch her at work. Patrick Macnee, David Yip, and Willoughby Gray have smaller supporting roles, but are no less capable. As a minor side note, it's fun to see Dolph Lundgren here, for a grand total of 1-2 seconds of screen time, in his first film role; it's likewise a surprise to see Alison Doody in her supporting part, a few years before her very prominent role in 'Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade.'John Barry's score is reliably fantastic, maintaining the sense of adventure of the movie and often echoing the titular theme. Duran Duran's song ""A view to a kill"" is easily among the better selections of the franchise, inherently imparting a measure of playfulness that provides balance to the more dramatic chords.In a series plagued by excess and self-indulgence, it takes an adept, stubborn writer, and or director, to be able to lift a film out of the muck. John Glen and Richard Maibaum have a long if spotty record with James Bond, but when they're at the top of their game, they pull off some swell successes. 'A view to a kill' has its problems, but is certainly more enjoyable than not. Even with some of the silliness at hand, for 007 enthusiasts and general audiences alike, this is a fun, worthwhile action-adventure flick.",A View to a Kill
86,ShootingShark,Moore's Swansong As James Bond Is Entertaining But Uneven Action Spectacular,5,26 September 2010,"British secret agent James Bond is called in to investigate Max Zorin, a wealthy business tycoon with an insane plan to flood Silicon Valley in California and gain control of the world supply of microchip processors. Can this madman be stopped ?This is seventh and final of Moore's outings as the suave, supercool spy 007, and whilst in my view it's one of the weakest, it's still cracking good entertainment. It's got all the classic elements; car chases, sexy women, hair-raising fights, crazy gadgets and tons of spectacular scenes like the final showdown on top of the Golden Gate Bridge. The main reason it doesn't work so well for me is because the tone varies pretty wildly; the straight ahead spy stuff is great but there are too many comedy moments like the Keystone Kops chase on a fire engine, mixed with a horribly violent scene towards the end where Zorin gratuitously massacres a mine full of construction workers. The mine sequence features an incredible set and an astonishing flood sequence but is really tacky; it's interesting that the BBFC rated this film as a PG (as all Bond films are), but if somebody like Walter Hill or John Woo had put that in their movie it would be an instant 18/R. Moore is good but perhaps a little too old (he was fifty-seven) and mismatched against a great method actor like Walken. Jones is fun in a nutty sort of way but Roberts is a bit of a wet blanket. One of the comedy scenes that does work is the hot tub sequence with sexy Fullerton; it's a bit of a shame her part isn't more substantial. The story is completely potty (even by Bond standards), complete with drugged horses, a crazed Josef Mengele character, a villainess who switches sides ten minutes from the end and a central premise lifted from Superman. As ever with this series though, it is extremely handsomely produced, with superb art direction from Peter Lamont, stunning costumes by Emma Porteous and a thrilling score by John Barry with a huge romantic main theme. It's also worth noting that this was the last appearance of the charming Maxwell as Miss Moneypenny; she was in all fourteen of the official Bond films up to this one and brightened every one of them. Look fast also for a young Dolph Lundgren (Jones' boyfriend at the time, would you believe) as a heavy in the scene where the KGB chew out Zorin. Not Bond's finest hour by quite some way but a spectacular epic nonetheless, shot in San Francisco, Paris, Chantilly, Iceland, Ascot Racecourse and at Pinewood Studios.",A View to a Kill
87,adamjohns-42575,A view to a snooze!,2,7 September 2020,"Well, it was better than the last one, but actually quite slow this time, possibly because dear old Roger was just a bit too dear and old, as he himself admitted.
It was however nice to have a decent bad guy for a change and I'd love to see his character brought back, perhaps it was just because Christopher Walken played the part so well? Unlike Grace Jones and the Miss Sutton character who were terrible actors. It's a shame Dolph didn't have a bigger part (Must be all those steroids- tee hee) as I think he could have been good opposition for James, even though I'm not generally his biggest fan.The Duran Duran soundtrack was a success for me, but there's nothing else about the film that I found particularly noteworthy. I think a good half an hour could have been cut from it although it was good to have a bit of a pause and to see Bond not just making puns, but actually spying. He does however seem to be a useless spy that always gets caught, but is fortunate enough to know how to escape, it's more MacGyver than espionage.Still a bit too Austin Powers for me. I'd rather watch the Mike Myers version.",A View to a Kill
88,davidmvining,Bleh.,3,26 February 2020,"This feels like no one cared and everyone was bored except Christopher Walken who just made the best of it. Moore doesn't want to be there. Tanya Roberts looks lost. The story barely exists and goes on meandering tangents for entire acts that don't matter. We get characters introduced and dropped like a hat. This is probably the least enjoyable Bond film up to this point, and I watched Diamonds are Forever.The confusion starts from the beginning. We get another ski chase. It's derivative of several Bond movies before it, but it does have some good moments around snowmobiles. However, Bond is in Siberia to find 003 and the locket that contains a microchip. Returning this to MI6, we learn that the chip is a copy of a Western design that's built to resist EMP pulses. So, EMPs are going to be part of this somehow, right? No, never mentioned again. We do get to follow Bond to a horse race, though.It's there that Bond sees Max Zorin, Walken's villain, and watches Zorin's horse win improbably. Bond then goes to Zorin's French manor where he takes part in a horse auction and discovers that Zorin is using microchips to...deliver steroids to horses in the middle of races, or something. Does any of this excruciating detail about horses, chips, auctions, or races matter? No, not in the least. And the movie spends about a quarter of its run time on it.You see, Zorin's plot doesn't have to do with EMPs or horses or even really microchips. He's going to drill the fault lines around Silicon Valley to flood it because he believes they build microchips there. Bond could have ended the whole misadventure by telling Zorin that Silicon Valley doesn't manufacture microchips, so his plan to flood it to kill their production of microchips was never going to work. In San Francisco, Bond meets Stacey Sutton who is the daughter of an oil magnate but got pushed out of her leadership position of the company by Zorin who's using her company's wells to make his plan work...or something. It doesn't matter. She's the Bond girl, and her real life mother was younger than Moore.Together, they investigate Zorin, but Bond takes a random side mission to sleep with a random female Russian agent in the area. They talk like they have history (supposedly, it was originally supposed to be Barbara Bach's character from The Spy who Loved Me, but she wouldn't do the movie), sleep together, and she tries to steal a tape from him that contains Zorin talking specifics of the plot. She then disappears from the movie forever. This might have worked slightly with Bach, but it doesn't with random blonde lady. It shouldn't have been filmed, much less included in the final cut.Anyway, Bond and Stacey investigate one of Zorin's sites at a mine where Zorin kills all of his employees, escapes in a balloon, and Bond gives chase with a decent action scene on top of the Golden Gate Bridge.This movie is awful. It gets lost in unimportant details for long stretches. It feels randomly generated from an algorithm instead of assembled by a screenwriter. Moore is bored. Walken and Grace Jones make the most of their roles, what little there is of them, by being outlandish performers, but it doesn't change the fact that Zorin is a boring villain with a stupid plan that makes no sense. This is a sad way for Bond to go out on. He would have been better to go out in clown makeup in the much better Octopussy.",A View to a Kill
89,RatedVforVinny,A rather long in the tooth Bond.,6,26 November 2019,"I think i saw every one of Roger Moore's bonds in the cinema. This one's an unfairly overlooked entry, although is soon rather pedestrian (after an incredible opening ski sequence). Moore himself also looks rather aged for the role but he was always most comfortable (more than anyone else) in delivering the sexual innuendo jokes. A bleached-top christopher walken, plays a parody of a Bond villain (completely wasted!) and Grace Jones, delivers even less! On the upside, in the mid 80's, Bond films still contained the World's most dangerous stunt and chase sequences. The title song is also one of the most memorable of the latter day Bonds and John Barry delivers yet another top score.",A View to a Kill
90,ArtVandelayImporterExporter,A View to Kill Die Hard,7,21 September 2019,"Despite closing in on 60. Roger Moore does more than OK in this, his 7th and final outing as Bond. In fact, that age thing might have helped. The writers seem to have toned down the pervy cheese that mars so many Bond films.For action fans there's the ski sequence, the super-cool steeplechase that pays homage to Ben Hur, the fire truck chase, and the Golden Gate clim@x. What's not to like here?For my money, Christopher Walken is the best Bond villain of all time. No contest, In fact, I was halfways cheering for him to prevail. And Grace Jones is my favorite Bond hench(wo)man. They both bring an edgy menace to things while still seeming human. Most bond baddies are clowns, with about as much menace as pro wrestling bad guys; while the henchmen are usually ripped right from the pages of Marvel comics,The soundtrack rates right up there, too, riffing nicely on the eight bars or so that are tolerable about an otherwise molar-grinding theme song by an MTV-manufactured band.The one glaring weakness is Tanya Roberts.

The makers of the movie wanted them to make a song for the movie so that younger fans that loved mtv like 007 as much as their parents. As for the movie itself, it's pretty violent for a PG rated movie and the first Bond movie to be made a year after the PG-13 rating went into effect. The Living Daylights, which came out two years later and starring Timothy Dalton, would be the last ever James Bond movie to receive a PG rating before License to Kill became the first to receive a PG-13 rating and nearly killed the franchise due to corporate issues until Goldeneye saved it.",A View to a Kill

""A View To A Kill"" wasn't too well-received when it came out, but I seriously have no idea why. It's a highly entertaining movie, filled with all of the elements that you could possibly watch Bond flicks for. It goes on for almost two and a half hours, but it contains more than enough action to justify that running time.

93,Zbigniew_Krycsiwiki,Underrated,7,17 March 2011,"Roger Moore, looking in better shape here than in the previous film (Octopussy) returns for his 007th, and final, turn as Bond, this time trying to thwart plans of a rich industrialist planning to sink part of California. Roger Moore, Moneypenny, M, and Q are all pensionable here, and the screenplay has little to do with the short-story From A View To A Kill (besides its French location) but I still think this is an improvement over the previous Bond film, with a more serious tone to some scenes, better action and a sexier leading lady (even though her character in annoying) Sequences at the stables are good, and seem like they are loosely based on a similar section of the book Diamonds Are Forever, but don't really go anywhere. Something additional should have been learned about Zorin's plan to cause the earthquake, or Zorin himself, here.The producers and screenwriters here seem to be trying for a more serious side to Bond here, and Roger Moore does that well here, but they still hold on to some of the sillier jokes featured before, like making a mockery out of the well done opening ski scenes by having The Bleach Boys belching California Girls over it; and Bond's chase through the Eiffel Tower and the streets of Paris becomes inane when he starts driving the incredible self-dismantling car, as another vehicle clips the rear left side and its entire back half snaps off like it were made of plastic.Overall though, the good far outweighs the bad here, and if one can turn off one's mind, just sit back and enjoy the ride, this movie can be a lot better than its reputation has it, and a fine sendoff for Roger Moore as James Bond.*** out of ****",A View to a Kill
94,brando647,It's Never as Good as I Remember...,5,30 October 2015,"A VIEW TO A KILL is the most frustrating 007 movie in the series because it's far from being a good film but my memory, for whatever reason, continues to paint it as one. I'll go for a while without watching it and then, one day, I'll be mulling over which 007 movie I feel like revisiting. Inevitably, A VIEW TO A KILL will come to mind and I'll think back and remember how much cheesy fun it is. On the chance I settle on the movie, I'll watch it and, not even halfway through, discover I've been conned yet again. I can't bring myself to call it a horrible movie (though I might see how others could accuse it of such) because I'm a major 007 fan. I've got a bias and I still believe that the worst of the films are still better than most other garbage out there. I can always find something to love about the movies and that includes this one. So, if you're looking for an outsider's unbiased perspective on A VIEW TO A KILL, this probably isn't the place. Roger Moore's final outing as the legendary British secret agent tries to jump on, what was at the time, at modern adventure about the technology industry. It starts with an investigation into industry mogul Max Zorin (Christopher Walken) and some potential funny business in the world of horse breeding. It's soon revealed that Zorin, a powerful man in the world of microchip production, has a plan to eliminate his competition by literally wiping Silicon Valley off the map.We'll ignore the fact that the destruction of Silicon Valley is the exact opposite of how Zorin would accomplish his goal and would, actually, ruin his business this way. Plot holes and poor research are expected often in these movies. So what are my problems with A VIEW TO A KILL? For starters, poor Roger Moore is just too old to be globe-trotting and fighting evil at this point. Just one look at the man tells you he is well past the point of successfully portraying this iconic character. I give him props for doing his best but, come on, his stunt doubles are the most blatant in this movie than in any other. It's almost distracting. Anything that isn't the most basic of movement for Moore is a stand-in. The film wastes no time in flaunting this with an opening sequence in Siberia where Bond must escape some Russians on skis. At no point is it believably Moore. And don't get me started on the use of the Beach Boys tune to the scene of Bond snowboarding to escape. It's just not right. Moving on, the film is just too long. Well, length isn't the problem. I've got no problem with a 007 movie being over two hours; my problem is that it feels it because there's so little going on to care about. The first act at Zorin's estate with the horse-breeding (which, keep in mind, has little to do with the big-picture plot of the film) lasts something like half the movie. So the movie is somewhere around half over when the microchip stuff and Silicon Valley stuff come into play. And then there's Tanya Roberts as the movie's Bond woman, Stacy Sutton. Roberts is only slightly more believable as a geologist than Denise Richards was as a nuclear physicist in THE WORLD IS NOT ENOUGH, and she spends most of her screen time screaming ""James!"" and failing to stay out of danger.So what worked? Well, Roger Moore has always been one of my top 007 actors because of the charm and humor he brings to the character. His body might be showing his age but his personality is intact and makes some of the cheesier dialogue a little easier to stomach. And then there's the fact that he's facing off in this movie against Christopher Walken. Let me repeat that: Christopher Walken. In a 007 movie. That's awesome enough. I do wish his character had been built up more. Zorin is really underdeveloped and his history is a little shady. Apparently he was genetically modified since birth by the KGB (in the same manner as his horses, I guess) and he's supposed to be a near-perfect human: vastly intelligent and above-average physical prowess. He doesn't display it much here. I mean, his plan makes little sense and he's bested by an aged Roger Moore in physical combat. He just goes the route of the psychopath. That's his one real character trait. His main ""henchman"" and the film's femme fatale is Grace Jones as May Day. Really, if Zorin wanted to win, all he had to do was send May Day after 007. She's an imposing woman. Her character also gets the most ""character development"" (I know I'm using a lot of quotes here but I want to be clear I'm using a lot of these terms loosely) in the film. She's Zorin's most trusted associate and we find she views him as more than that, culminating in a proper send-off for her character in the final act. Let's seeI loved the use of San Francisco as a location. When I think of Bond, I think of exotic locations so the juxtaposition of putting him in 80's era California still entertains me. And I would be stupid not to mention the film's title song, performed by Duran Duran. I love this song and it rates as probably my favorite title song of the entire series. When I have the urge to watch this movie, I think it's just my brain trying to tell me I need to go listen to this track.Would I recommend A VIEW TO A KILL? To the average viewer, probably not. To a 007 fan, you've probably already seen it. The real question is: can we bring Walken back for another new 007 movie or have we wasted our chance?",A View to a Kill
95,coltras35,Dance into the fire!!,10,4 October 2021,"Roger Moore's final Bond film, A view to a kill, is a criminally underrated entry in the canon, and I just don't get what's the gripe is about. From the opening sequence, it jumps on to one dazzling event to the next, the pace flowing. The plot just sucks you in like a vacuum - The racetrack scenes, the Eiffel Tower scene where Bond chases Mayday after she kills an informer, and the investigation at Zorin's mansion. It just rocks, and never lets up the pace. It's never boring and it's a glorious romp with some killer action sequences.The story-The recovery of a microchip off the body of a fellow agent leads James Bond to a mad industrialist who plans to create a worldwide microchip monopoly by destroying California's Silicon ValleyAs for Roger Moore, he's on top form, on a roll as a mature Bond - the word ""old"" is a bit degrotory - who still looks handsome, but importantly is exuding confidence, a great screen presence, elan and smooth as ever, but his fun approach is tempered with a seriousness and determination. His dialogues, especially when conversing with Zorin, are delivered brilliantly. His disgust for Zorin is very apparent. It's seems too convincing. He is much more mature and less winking at the camera - the only thing the filmmakers should've done in this entry was indicate that Bond is retiring, that this is his last hurrah, that way miserable moaners who go on about his age wouldn't raffle on about that point. ( odd though that the literary Bond chronologically is way past 60!!)The action sequences are awesome, well-staged, exciting, especially the pre-credit sequence with the skiing, and Bond tackling the swarming helicopter. Matching this is the Eiffel Tower and the mine sequence - the latter is just pure cliffhanger. The cinematography is superb, especially around the golden gate where Bond and Stacy is clinging to life as Zorin wields his axe. The bits in between the excitement is engaging, with plenty of investigation and tech talk.Christopher Walken is suitably creepy as the psychotic as Max Zorin, the way he shoot his own employees is so callous, and underpins his disturbed persona. Grace Jones as his henchwoman is menacing and emotes well when Zorin stabs her in the back. The oft-criticised Bond girl Stacey Sutton played by the sexy Tanya Roberts was really good, capturing that innocence of Bond girls Solitaire and Melina Havelock - she can scream ""James"" a lot, but if you're hanging to dear life in some perilous situations, what else would you do but scream. Patrick Macnee makes an inspiring appearance as the ill-fated Tibet, alongside his former ITC mate, Roger Moore. He's the third actor from the Avengers to appear.A view to a kill might have some shoddy editing in regards to it being obvious that it isn't Roger but a stuntman, but overall it's an exciting addition to the franchise, and a fitting end to Roger Moore's tenure in a role that made him a household name. He's always been a heroic, Douglas Fairbanks-type of Bond, so it was fitting to see him carry Stacy down the ladder. A hark back to when heroes were heroes. In 1985 that was very much anachronistic - a farewell to the old-fashioned hero.",A View to a Kill

98,pyrocitor,Bond at his worst,3,22 September 2004,"(spoilers herein)After the very nice piece of work that was Octopussy was released in theaters, I must say that I was nothing less than appalled when I saw the lumbering monstrosity 'A View to a Kill' which succeeded it.Now where to begin? There is so much wrong with this movie that I can't even be subtle when trashing it. There were rumours of severe budget cuts throughout the production of A View to a Kill, and after seeing the movie I would have to guess that the rumours were absolutely correct. We see a camera reflected on the rear of a fire truck and on the windshield of a car pushed into a lake and the 'May Day' who explodes with the bomb is very obviously a dummy. This is the sort of botched stunt we would expect to see in the early 60s, not in the mid 80s! The action is snail paced and totally uninteresting, the chase scene on the fire truck seemed horribly out of place, as did the inclusion of a Beach Boys song during a snowmobile chase (this was funny for all the wrong reasons) and the love plot is completely screwed up thanks to Tanya Rogers. Why oh why would they cast her? There are many other pretty actresses who can at least PRETEND to act. Rogers squeals like a stuck pig throughout the movie, and spends the rest of the time being enormously clumsy. She proves to be easily the least convincing Bond woman next to Britt Eckland, who I can never forgive for messing up The Man with the Golden Gun. Scriptwise, all the writing is pathetic, to say the least, with the exception of a couple of good lines given to Zorin. Bond's 'Bond-isms' seem to be a last minute rewrite, and they come off as glaringly obvious, and just plain stupid. To add insult to injury, Q spends the entire movie playing with a ridiculous little robotic dog thing, which is apparently supposed to be a surveillance device, despite the fact that it is large, loud and conspicuous. Honestly guys! Don't drag Q into the stupidity!Speaking of budget cuts, the quality of this movie is so poor that they don't even seem to be able to afford an original plot. The one used is an obscenely obvious remake of Goldfinger, with billionaire Tycoon Max Zorin (Christopher Walken) trying to rule the world's supply of microchips by destroying Silicon Valley. Sound familiar? Now why would that be? Oh yes! It's because it's exactly what Auric Goldfinger did in his namesake film, except using gold instead of microchips, and Fort Knox in the place of Silicon Valley. While Goldfinger's plan to turn all the gold in Fort Knox radioactive sounded almost possible, Zorin's flooding of Silicon Valley comes off sounding rather lame and ludicrous.Continuing my 'Obvious Goldfinger takeoffs', I note that there is still a tycoon who will 'have no part' in the mastermind's plan, a psychotic and downright scary henchman, (this time it's Grace Jones instead of a 300 pound Korean wrestler, the difference being she has no razor tipped bowler hat) the villain double-crosses all his lackeys and kills them all, and...what? You've lost interest? OK, then I'll move on.It was nice to see Patrick Macnee as Bond's temporary assistant, even if he was denied the screen time he deserves, the Duran Duran title song was nothing less than excellent, and Roger Moore, despite looking too haggard and grandfatherly to properly convince, proves yet again that no one can be more suave than him. Grace Jones was very scary and memorable as May Day, there's no denying that, and Christopher Walken is finally given the chance to do what he does best and go totally homicidal with a machine gun, and later a fire axe. Sadly, he falls to his death from the Golden Gate Bridge and ends any semblance of quality in the movie. It's just a shame that before the end fight scene he's given pretty much nothing to do, and seems to be fervently wishing he was somewhere else. (understandable: he could see how the movie was going to turn out) What irked me about his character was that he was supposed to be a French industrialist, yet he had a very openly American accent. That isn't too bothersome, though, considering all the other problems with the movie. What a shame. I can't even say that the movie had the potential to be great, because I would feel that I was lying. Much like Zorin's blimp, this movie was doomed from when it was first revealed, and not even including Christopher Walken and Patrick Macnee could save it. It's a shame Moore had to leave the series on such a bad note.-3.5/10",A View to a Kill
99,Sirus_the_Virus,I think it's underrated.,9,28 August 2009,"A View to a kill is one of the most underrated Bond films ever. Alongside The Man with the Golden gun and Octopussy. Both of which are films that I like a lot. I also think Live and let die is incredibly underrated. Face it, most of the non Sean Connery bond films are underrated. But I think that A view to a kill deserves a little more credit than it received. Everything in the movie deserves more credit. Critics have never quite given Roger Moore enough credit than Sean Connery. Because he's not Sean Connery. I actually like Roger Moore just as much as Sean Connery. Sue me I don't care. Well, perhaps I do care. Because it's my money going away because i'm defending Roger Moore. I'm not saying that A view to a kill is a fantastic classic that deserved tons of Oscars. I really and truly did like it though. I think the Bond girl(Stacey Stutton) was forgettable no less. She's not Xania Onnatopp or Vesper Lynd. But the villain Max Zorin (Christopher Walken) and May Day(Grace Jones) are rememberable. A view to a kill is an underrated but to me rememberable Bond film. I mostly remember it by the action sequence on The Golden Gate Bridge and the fantastic Bond song""A View to a kill"" by Duran Duran. I also think that Roger Moore is memorable as Bond. This was his last film as Bond. Which truly is a shame. No he's not dead. Is A view to a kill as good as From Russia with love? No. Is it as good as Live and let die? No. But it's still an effective Bond film that I am sure to remember.The Plot: An investigation of a horse racing scam leads 007 to a mad industrialist named Max Zorin, who is planning on inventing a worldwide microchip monopoly that is to flood Silicon Valley.",A View to a Kill

Roger Moore seems like he made this only because he was contracted to. Chris Walken who is one of the great Amercian actors seems lost in his role as the villian , when it comes to the bond Grace Jones is black and ugly as ever and Tanya Roberts just seems lost.

101,jeremycrimsonfox,So-So End To Roger Moore's Time As Bond,6,5 April 2019,"A View to a Kill is the final film with Roger Moore as Bond, and yeah, it is a bit so-so.The plot is after recovering a microchip from a deceased agent in Siberia, 007 is sent to investigate Zorin Industries, which leads to a race against time to stop Max Zorin, the owner of Zorin Industries and rouge KGB agent, from destroying Silicon Valley.One of the problems that keeps this movie from being perfect is the fact they make some mistakes, like in the intro, where they play California Girls when James decides to use an object as a makeshift snowboard to escape Russian ski patrol officers (I have nothing against the Beach Boys, I think the song is good, but I'm saying it does not fit well with an escape scene in a snow setting). Also, Roger Moore does look a bit too old for the role, especially when it gets to the obligatory sex scenes. But the movie does have okay action sequences (like James trying to chase May Day through the streets of Paris), and the theme song by Duran Duran is nice.",A View to a Kill
102,Beta_Gallinger,"Like Sean Connery, Roger Moore certainly didn't go out with his strongest film in the official Bond movie franchise",5,17 October 2008,"After twelve years of playing James Bond, starring in a total of seven films in the franchise, ""A View to a Kill"" finally marked the end of Roger Moore's stint in the role. Sadly, like Sean Connery, whose last official Bond film was 1971's ""Diamonds Are Forever"", Moore's stint ended with one of the disappointing installments in the franchise. Not only was this his final outing as Bond, it was also the end for Lois Maxwell as Miss Moneypenny, and she had been playing that role since the franchise began with Connery in 1962, so her 23 years of appearing in Bond films didn't end so well, either.Bond returns to England with a microchip from the USSR, one which turns out to be identical to the ones manufactured by Zorin Industries! The secret agent is sent to investigate this company and its owner, Max Zorin. During his mission, the secret agent discovers that Max Zorin is drilling near the San Andreas Fault in California! The owner of Zorin Industries has a sinister plan to cause an earthquake there and destroy Silicon Valley! On this mission, as usual, Bond finds himself in a some deadly situations, and will not only have to face the evil and insane Max Zorin in different places, but also his very strong lover and henchwoman, May Day! Eventually joining agent 007 on the mission is a geologist named Stacey Sutton.I know I'm not the first to point this out, but Christopher Walken doesn't put on a very good performance as the main villain in this movie. In fact, the character may get pretty absurd at times, especially towards the end! Also, Grace Jones doesn't play May Day convincingly, and Tanya Roberts' performance as Stacey Sutton is average at best, certainly no match for many other actresses who have played Bond sidekicks. In addition to problems with certain cast members, ""A View to a Kill"" also has similar problems as ""Octopussy"", the last film that came before it, such as lack of excitement for the most part (I did find it exciting towards the end, but not very much before that at all), and it may be tiresome enough to seem longer than it actually is. Most of the action in this film didn't seem to grab me. Instead, it usually bored me, and perhaps sometimes got on my nerves a bit.I know ""Octopussy"" is more popular than this film, but I'm not sure which one I think is worse. However, ""A View to a Kill"" just MIGHT be a bit worse in my book. I may have rated it 4/10 if it weren't for the excitement I found towards the end, after so much dullness, and I've never rated a Bond film lower than 5/10 before! Now that I've seen all seven of the films in the franchise starring Roger Moore, I can say I think his first two (""Live and Let Die"" and ""The Man with the Golden Gun"") are decent, his third (""The Spy Who Loved Me"") is better, but it all went downhill from there with ""Moonraker"", and never improved much after that, only slightly with ""For Your Eyes Only"", and then went back down to average at best with his last two, ""Octopussy"" and ""A View to a Kill"". So, while I don't think Moore was bad as James Bond, and would say he definitely was in some decent films in the franchise, he unfortunately starred in a string of disappointing ones before finally leaving in the mid-eighties.",A View to a Kill
103,vip_ebriega,"The usual Bond formula, but still very enjoyable.",7,21 February 2007,"My Take: Goes by the usual Bond movie formula, but this time, much more enjoyable than the previously appalling OCTOPUSSY. After staying on screen for numerous years in the role of James Bond, Roger Moore does his final performance with this film. ""A View to a Kill"" is actually does the usual expectations for a 007 flick. Bond is sent thwart the plots of maniacal industrialist Max Zorin (Christopher Walken) to flood California's Silicon Valley by breaking the San Andreas Fault. It's simply as expected, but there is still enough action to keep a Bond fan glued to their seat.Moore is getting too old, but still keeps the suave charms of James Bond. Christopher Walken is deliciously psychopathic (he is THE Christopher Walken after all). The Bond girls (Tanya Roberts and Grace Jones) aren't much good though. Roberts, despite being gorgeous, is bland while Grace Jones is just dreadful. But the film has a lot of exciting moments. There's the opening sequence, where Bond narrowly escapes a helicopter while skiing through Russian ice landscape. But the best would be the final showdown atop the Golden Gate Bridge. Director John Glen almost nearly makes up for the plot. But among the elements that make it worthwhile is the title song by Duran Duran, one of my favorite Bond themes.Overall, it's not the disappointment that others dismiss it. While its completely formula and almost forgettable once you've seen it, I like ""A View to a Kill"", a decent end to Moore's tenure as the British super-spy.Rating: ***1/2 out of 5.",A View to a Kill
104,one9eighty,With bubbles to tickle your... Tchaikovsky!,7,26 August 2020,"The 14th official Bond, and the 7th (and last) with Roger Moore in the famous tuxedo. This time Bond is investigating a microchip... hang on in there because this explanation my go off the rails...At the start of the film Bond is in Russia, retrieving a computer chip from a dead double-o agent. Once back home and its investigating, the chip turns out to be made by Zorin Industries. The chip can withstand an EMP explosion, meaning that in the event of a nuclear explosion, anyone with this chip in their technology would be okay to operate as normal. Off Bond goes to Ascot to spy on Max Zorin (Christopher Walken). Zorin's horse wins but needs controlling at the end of the race by one of his 'henchwomen', thus introducing May Day (Grace Jones). Sir Godfrey Tibbet (Patrick Macnee), who is an MI6 agent and horse trainer, believes Zorin's horses are drugged to win. He arranges a meeting for Bond with a French investigator called Achilles Aubergine at the Eiffel Tower. Aubergine is killed and Bond loses the assassin while pursuing. Posing at St. John Smythe and his butler, Bond and Sir Tibbett go undercover at Zorin's mansion/country estate to see what they can find. He almost finds some information from Stacey Sutton (Tanya Roberts) who attends a gala to meet with Zorin covertly. As Bond cannot get near her, he, and Sir Tibbett resort to snooping. They find out that microchips are embedded in the horses which control the release of a steroid, helping the horses win. Bond sleeps with May Day to ensure cover is not broken, but after a meeting Zorin is able to work out who Smythe really is - a 'License to Kill' secret agent. Sir Tibbett is killed, and various attempts are made on Bond's life. KGB General, Gogol (Walter Gotell) visit's Zorin to tell him off for getting mixed up with Bond, but Zorin announces he doesn't need to KGB sticking their noses in, despite being trained by them himself. With Bond seemingly out of the way Zorin moves his plan forward, he meets fellow bad guys in his zeppelin/airship and announces his intention to destroy Silicon Valley, thus stopping 80% of the world computer chips being made - meaning he would have the monopoly. Bond learns that Zorin is the child of a Nazi experiment to create super intelligent people and that as a psychopath he probably is a bigger threat than to just the world of horses. Bond goes to one of Zorin's oil pumping stations and finds out that its working wrong. He bumps into KGB agent Pola Ivanova, who has a tape of Zorin's intentions. Bond sleeps with and switched the tape for himself (his 4th sexual encounter in the film). Now he has more of an idea that Zorin's plan involves land, so he goes undercover as a reporter to the local government in charge of these kind of things. He meets Stacey again; she is working there to try and make ends meet. Zorin has taken over her grandfather's oil company and she is trying to fight it but is running out of money. After piecing the evidence about Zorin together, they go to confront Stacey's boss but Zorin turns up and kills the boss and tries to frame Bond and Stacey in the process. They escape the police in a fire engine and go to Zorin's mine to put a stop to him. They discover a bomb, Stacey gets captured, May Day helps Bond deal with the bomb and Zorin escapes with Stacey. Bond manages to stop Zorin escaping in his airship over the Golden gate bridge. A fight ensues and Zorin is killed, Bond saves the day and gets the girl.With all this happening, it is no wonder that the film has a runtime of over 2 hours (131 min). This was an original film, based purely on an Ian Fleming title, but with original content which was written by Richard Maibaum and Michael G. Wilson - who both have other writing credits in the Bond universe. John Glen once again directs this, as he did most of the official 80's Bond films. The budget was $30 million and at the worldwide box office the takings were $152.4 million - so it was a major success.In interviews, Moore has suggested that this was his least favourite Bond films in the franchise. Age was catching up with him and he was horrified to find out that he was older than Tanya Robert's mother. He was also unhappy with the amount of blood and guts, in particularly criticising the way that Zorin just gunned down innocent people for no real reason. This was also some of the critique that film reviewers had about this entry into the Bond universe. However, it was also equally praised by other film critics suggesting that this was the best Moore performance, he looked sharp and was engaging. So, a bit of a mixed bag when it comes down to it. As far as the cast goes, I thought Moore's last outing as 007 was good, this is possibly one of my favourite Moore outings - ""The Man with the Golden Gun"" being my top pick. By now you know what to expect from the eyebrow raising suave secret agent, and Moore does not fail to deliver. As well as it being Moore's last film, it also happens to be Lois Maxwell's last outing as Miss Moneypenny. After 14 other appearances in the role the last time you see her is crying into her hanky before she retires from her majesties secret service. She (Maxwell) was a fantastic servant to the role and always delivered keenly with a rye and knowing smile. Desmond Llewelyn is of course Q in this film and Robert Brown returns as M. Walter Gotell also returns as General Gogol, a role he never really got enough credit for. A major casting choice for this film was Christopher Walken, who by this time already has as Academy Award to his name. He is fantastic as Max Zorin, easily once of Bond's best villains. It's a pity that by this stage in the Bond franchise everything was so throw-away, because he would have been great as a reoccurring bad guy for a follow up film. He is menacing and witty and commands attention with his on-screen presence. His number 1 is May Day, played by Grace Jones. Fresh off the back of her performance in ""Conan the Destroyer"" (1984) she is intense and menacing - somebody who clearly isn't going to let Bond get away with his usual antics... well, until he gets away with his usual antics anyway. I'm not really a fan of Grace Jones, in this film her presence is more affective than her dialogue delivery which is wooden at times. It's nice to see Patrick Macnee in this film, who for years had been one of ""The Avengers"" with Diana Rigg - famously the only woman to marry Bond. Mcnee always manages to deliver well in everything I have seen him in, he suave and cool, but is only a moment away from a cheesy smile. Then there is Tanya Roberts, as Stacey, silky smooth on the eye but at times in this delivering line which felt forced. There are moments where she comes alive and delivers a great performance, but there are times where she looks and sounds uncomfortable too. Keep an eye open for Dolph Lundgren making his acting debut (he got the role as he was in the right place at the right time, dating Grace Jones during filming). Also making a debut is Alison Doody, who some people may know as Elsa in ""Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade"" where she get's to actually kiss a one of the Bond stars (Connery).There are lots of nice locations in this and there is plenty of action. For me this is a typical Bond film and is has all the elements to be a successful film. Stereotypical of the era, Bond beds 4 woman, which is joint record in the Bond films. There is plenty of attitude from all the stars in the film. There are a few gadgets for the kids to enjoy seeing. The soundtrack by John Barry is epic. The theme tune by Duran Duran is excellent - in some polls it has been voted the best Bond theme song, but I won't debate that here. My only real criticism, if any, is that there is an awful lot crammed into this film. This easily could have been condensed to be more effective, or it could have been a series of films. Considering where film starts off and ends - dealing with a microchip and then a location which famously makes microchips (Silicon Valley) - it takes a bloody long time to get there. I guess that's how the excess of the 80's works though - why have a little of something when you can gorge on as much as you can cram in.I love this film, I loved the cheesy computer game in the 80's, I had the famous watch which was released in association with this film. A great send off for Moore, and a great film all around. Family friendly, loads of fun, and a great and stylish adventure.In terms of Bond films this is an 8 out of 10.In terms of movies in the long and illustrious history of film I would give this a 7 out of 10.",A View to a Kill
105,Mister-6,"Really, 007...",2,6 February 2000,"Ever wonder what happens when you try to make a James Bond film in such a hurry that you don't have time to write a script?You get ""A View to a Kill"".This marks the first Bond film which was not based on one of Ian Fleming's great books and the last in which Roger Moore essayed the part of 007.  But it also makes for one of the weakest Bond films ever (especially after the dynamic goings-on in 1983's ""Octopussy"").  The story itself is no great shakes; bad guy Zorin (Walken) wants to wipe out Silicon Valley and make himself the worldwide supplier of computer micro-chips (I think; if nothing else, the screenplay is a mess of information that makes 1040 forms look relatively simple). 
And the characters are pretty pale (especially Roberts - she is the WHINIEST Bond girl I've ever seen), except for Grace Jones' May Day.  Now, if SOMEONE really needed to tone it down, she's my candidate.There's not even any cool Bond gadgets in this one; just trick sunglasses that let you see through tinted windows...and that's about it. 
And slapstick, slapstick, slapstick!  You'd think the Keystone Kops co-wrote this movie with Laurel and Hardy as technical advisors.  Never have such elaborate sight gags seemed so out of place.  Always a sign of desperation when they use a building's radio antennae for a shot-to-the-groin joke - aimed at James Bond!!I usually LOVE the Bond films, and I can usually find stuff to defend in them to every anti-Bond fan I've ever met.  But as for ""A View to a Kill"", they win that argument.Two stars.  The pre-title sequence in the Arctic was well-done as was the car chase through Paris.

Look for Dolph Lundgren (then Grace Jones boyfriend & body guard) as a henchman.Moore may not have been the best Bond, but this was somewhat unimpressive note for him to end on (he really should have bowed at either ""Moonraker"" or ""For Your Eyes Only"" or ""Octopussy"" since his age was starting to show by FYEO).

109,ivo-cobra8,Moore's last decent Bond very underrated and unappreciated good 007 flick,10,12 November 2017,"A View to a Kill (1985) is guilty pleasure of mine. I don't think it is a terrible movie like mostly people are saying. I love this film always did and it is one of my favorite Bond films. This is the last Roger Moore movie he did before he was passing on Timothy Dalton. It is very underrated and I know that Roger Moore him self has stated that A View to a Kill is his at least favorite James Bond film because Christopher Walken was machine gunning everyone. I have enjoyed the film it was fast paced, entertaining and it had action. I know it does have flaws and mistakes like every movie does. I have enjoyed action and Roger Moore was good in his performance. He did 100% off him and he is acting was decent it wasn't so much goofy or terrible in my opinion.A View to a Kill is the 14th entry in the official James Bond series and the final film to star Roger Moore in the role of Agent 007. The 1985 installment follows Bond as he investigates a possible plot to destroy California's Silicon Valley. The film's cast includes Christopher Walken, Grace Jones, Tanya Roberts and Dolph Lundgren, who made his acting debut.I will say I have simply enjoy this flick more then I did The Man With The Golden Gun, Octopussy, From Russia With Love, Skyfall, Spectre, Quantum of Solace, The World Is Not Enough, Die Another Day and of course the worst Bond ever On Her Majesty's Secret Service.The cast: Tanya Roberts as Stacey Sutton was in my opinion good Bond girl. I have read so many negative comments about her performance. Because she was screaming, she was way too young for Roger Moore she looked like his daughter etc. I disagree she was good and I have enjoyed her performance.Grace Jones as May Day was another bad girl just like Famke Janssen in GoldenEye. Grace Jones was good as May Day Zorin's lover and chief henchwoman I thought she was really good at her performance.Christopher Walken was good as Max Zorin: a psychopathic industrialist he was really a good bad guy and I have enjoyed his performance. He did his job good and convincing and it was good in his good effort.This was really the only movie that was filmed in the USA in which they used Golden Gate Bridge in San Francisco. The movie really had a lot of action scenes. The car chases in San Francisco with fire truck the cops are chasing Bond and he with Stacey is fleeing trough the bridge. I love the mining scene in which May Day (Grace Jones) slide down Bond and they bring the larger bomb that would destroy the lock. They put the bomb on a handcar and push it out of the mine along a railroad line. May Day stays on the car to hold the faulty brake lever, sacrificing her own life as the bomb explodes.Great stunt on Eiffel Tower in which May Day jumps off the Eiffel Tower really great stunt scene. Great car scene in which Bond is chasing May Day with a stolen car. I know it was a stuntman and Roger Moore did not drive the car. In Stacey's house the fight with Bond and Zorin's henchman that wasn't Roger Moore fighting them that was his stuntman and it was funny, I thought the stuntman did a good job. But Tanya Roberts did her own stunts and she was good.I liked the opening scene in which Bond use a flare gun and shots down the helicopter that was cool. I really enjoy the song A View to a Kill from Duran Duran. I have enjoy the horse riding that was really joy able to me in which Bond races with the horse on the race track with Zorin and Zorin's henchman has set booby traps for Bond and Zorin's men get caught instead. I like Bond with a shotgun Remington and he has a rock salt in it. Pretty cool the first time we see Bond with the shotgun and rock salt.I did not thought that Roger Moore was that old or was that horrible, no he was really good at acting. I am sorry just my opinion. I like the burning elevator in the building in which Bond escapes and saves Stacey I love that sequence.I miss those kind of movies: like Rambo, Superman and James Bond 007 Roger Moore I miss movie like this? Why can't we get movies like this one back. Again I did not thought Tanya Roberts was horrible or Roger Moore is too old and Tanya Roberts is his daughter. This movie to me is unappreciated and I wasn't bored with it!9/10 better the Octopussy in my opinion it was good in my opinion.

110,bankofmarquis,Not the best,6,9 July 2015,"One of the weakest of the Bond films, A VIEW TO A KILL still has some good things going for it.Though Roger Moore is clearly long in the tooth for the role of James Bond, he actually looked younger and ""perkier"" than he did in his previous Bond outing OCTOPUSSY. He still imbues Bond with a solid ""wink"" in his eye and is capable of making something out of the rotten dialogue that was given to him.The fun part of this (and many) Bond films are the villains and this one does not disappoint. Again, though the dialogue and plot are flimsy (at best), Academy Award winner Christopher Walken has a great time playing (and overplaying) his role as Zorin. Ably assisting him is Grace Jones as henchmen Mayday. Not everyone's cup of tea, Jones' villain is instantly recognizable and different a chief henchmen as you will find in a Bond film. I was sad to see her character exit the movie.One other fun performance is that of the very professional and very proficient Patrick MacNee as Sir Godfrey Tibbett. His scenes with Moore are fun and playful, like two old friends finally getting a chance to play with each other.And here is where the good parts of this movie ends.The rest of this movie is laughably horrid. The plot - flimsy at best. The dialogue - clunky. The acting (especially Tanya Roberts Stacey Sutton) - flat, wooden and stilted. The stunts - unspectacular. The direction - uninspiring. The movie - mediocre.There is enough here to make this an enjoyable movie, it just isn't up to the level that a James Bond movie needs to be.6 (out of 10) stars (and that's being generous).

Awful I know.Talking about Zorin. He is the one of the two highlights of the film. Walken is a great actor and his performance deserves a far better Bond film than this. In a better Bond film he could possibly have made the best villain.

115,RonellSowes,Atrocious remake or rippoff of Goldfinger,3,7 November 2020,"There's now doubt that after the first couple,the imagination for the Bond films was diminishing and by the time of A View To A Kill they were mentally bankrupt.Richard Maibum and John Barry were recruited in an effort to bring some of the quality of the Connery films but as skilled as they are,neither are inexhaustible resources of talent. None of the clever quips Maibum used to deliver with are to be found; it's hard to imagine the man who did the music for Dr No did this.
The movie is a loose remake of Goldfinger but it doesn't deserve to be even mentioned in the same breadth. The action sequences are ridiculous and move with the fluidness of a car on square wheels. And the opening sequence is one of the worst of any of the Bonds.Roger Moore is a decent Bond...at least when he was young.He was far too old by the time he did this and his age serves as a large distraction throughout.Being such an odd and interesting actor,Christopher Walken is a good choice as a Bond villain but that doesn't stop his character from being a caricature of a person. Not to mention Grace Jones is the absolute worst Bond villain or girl or whatever she is.I can't believe one as terrible as A View To A Kill is the first James Bond movie I've reviewed on this site,not that anyone cares other than myself.",A View to a Kill
116,perfectbond,Another missed opportunity,7,17 November 2003,"This film could've been a feather in the cap of the series if Moore was anything approaching believablitiy as Bond at this point. He was simply too old for the physical aspects of th role, especially when stuntmen become apparent. The other major negative is May Day. She is just too brutish in appearance to be a Bond girl. Tanya Roberts as the other Bond girl rightly relies solely on her looks to win the audience over (at least me!). She was a big improvement over what was presented in that department in Octopussy. Walken as the villain made for very interesting viewing. His performance was a pleasure to watch. The action sequences on the Eiffel Tower, the mine shaft, fire engine, and especially the Golden Gate bridge seem like excess but they are actually quite entertaining. All in all this Bond outing is quite entertaining but like OHMSS, one can't help but feel an opportunity to create something special might have existed had the main attraction (ie. Bond himself) been better. Still, 7/10.",A View to a Kill
117,ofpsmith,Definitely a mixed bag.,6,7 May 2020,"I enjoy Roger Moore's portrayal of James Bond a lot and I enjoyed him in this film as well but it's pretty clear that he was getting too old. A common criticism of A View to a Kill is the obvious stunt doubles and, yeah, it can get a little bothersome after a while. There's also the problem of the plot which I didn't find amazingly memorable. Still there were things to enjoy about it. Christopher walken as Max Zorin and Grace Jones as May Day were fun and over the top villains and I even liked Stacey Sutton (Tanya Roberts). But overall A View to a Kill is one of Moore's weaker films.",A View to a Kill
118,Hayden-86055,Have a soft spot for this film,8,4 November 2020,"I love this film, it's one of my favourite pleasure films and just downright enjoyable. The plot's ridiculous without being silly and I love it. You have Christopher Walken, Grace Jones and Patrick Macnee all gracing the screen along with the now ageing but equally brilliant Roger Moore!The film opens up to an exhilarating ski chase, similar to the one in Spy who loved me but with an 80s twist, and then treated to a banging' theme tune by Duran Duran, all before the film hits the 10 minute mark. The rest of the film is about a massive plot at world domination, no more of that prancing around with small operations Zorin is taking it to the next level.Another positive is Christopher Walken and Grace Jones as Max Zorin and May Day. Both are brilliant and elaborate characters with personality, something a lot of villains and heroes these days don't have, the sets are gorgeous and Walken is glaringly over the top and hilarious, completely out of his mind. There's a very shocking scene near the end where Zorin mows down his workers with a machine gun, laughing all the time, shocking stuff. And the end fight on the golden gate bridge is one of my favourite bond scenes ever.Moore was showing his age a bit and you'll find yourself cringing at some of the love scenes with girls ridiculously out of his league and age range (reportedly the Bond girl's Mother was older than Moore, yikes) but I think a lot of that is just overblown, sure he's a bit older but it's not like he's 70 for crying out loud! He can play an action hero. I didn't like the Bond girl actress very much, and I thought the film was a bit too hammy in some places and slow in others but overall it was excellent8/10: Brilliant, ridiculous and crazily good fun",A View to a Kill
119,timdalton007,A View To A Disaster,1,29 February 2012,"With 1983's Octopussy having won ""the battle of the Bonds"" at the box office at least, work began on the next big screen adventure for James Bond. Roger Moore, now in his mid-50s, had tied with noted predecessor Sean Connery in doing six Bond films for EON productions. Moore though would do a seventh, and film, Bond film at the age of 56, 1985's A View To A Kill. In fact, it's thankful that it was him and not a new actor playing the role. If that had been the case, Bond might well have come to an end in the mid-1980s thanks to the worst film of the series.Looking at the film, it's clear that Moore was well past his prime in this film. Moore would seem to have aged quite a bit in the couple of years between making Octopussy and this film. He looks much older and not in a good way like when Connery returned to the role in Never Say Never Again. Moore looks laughably out of place as Bond be it in the action scenes (where he isn't clearly being doubled that is) but especially in scenes with his much younger female costars. It also doesn't help that Moore's performance is little more than the actor effectively sleep walking through the film, with little or no emotion present throughout. This is Moore at his worst as Bond.The film's cast doesn't improve from there sadly. After a series of stronger female characters, Tanya Roberts as Stacey Sutton is nothing short of a letdown. The character is a damsel in distress, who can do little more than scream and shout ""James!"" every so often. The character is poorly written and the performance of Tanya Roberts does the character no favors either as she goes for over the top every chance she gets. What we're left with is another worst: worst Bond girl of the series.Over the top doesn't begin to describe the film's villain Max Zorin played by Christopher Walken. Walken doesn't seem to take the role seriously at all from the moment he appears on the screen to the moment he thankfully exits the film. Walken plays Zorin with zero menace and instead plays up the insanity of the character by laughing manically almost every time he appears on screen. This was presumably for dramatic effect but instead makes the character utterly laughable and ridiculous. The result is a villain who is never threatening and a waste of an actor's talents.The supporting cast is mixed as well. Grace Jones as henchwoman May Day is even more over the top than Walken's Zorin with the result of being more annoying than threatening. The character is further ruined by a plot twist late in the film stolen out of an earlier Bond film (more on that later). Other villainous characters such as Patrick Bauchau's Scarpine and Willoughby Gray as a former Nazi scientist are little more than clichés on legs throughout. Other members of the supporting cast fare better though. Patrick Macnee as Sir Godfrey Tibbett gives what is perhaps the best performance in the entire film even though his character is all too often played for laughs. Also of mention is Lois Maxwell who plays Miss Moneypenny for the last time. Maxwell, like Moore, is well past her prime in the role but her exit from the series does little to mark her more than two decade long contribution to the series. The supporting cast is mixed though it does serve the film well in places.Moving into the production values, the film's other faults come into focus. The film's action sequences are played for laughs such as the snowbound teaser sequence (ruined by the use of a Beach Boys song) to the car chasing parachutist in Paris (further ruined by very, very obvious doubling of Moore) and most obviously in the fire truck chase through San Francisco. Other action sequences come across as uninspired, especially in the fight scenes at the Sutton house and the climatic fight on top of the Golden Gate Bridge. There is also increasingly obvious doubling of Moore in every single one of these sequences which detracts from the film itself and believability in its star. That isn't where the film is hurt the most however.Nothing lets the film down more than its script. The script does little more than rip off previous Bond films in a vain attempt to create something original. In particular, Goldfinger is effectively pillaged. There are horses, there's a plan to destroy a sizable chunk of the economic wealth (Fort Knox's gold in the previous film, Silicon Valley and its microchips here) to make the villains stockpile of said material all the more profitable, a last minute change of heart by a woman connected to the villain which derails the plan and an underwhelming final climatic fight between Bond and the main villain. For that matter, there are scenes in the film which seem ripped out of Goldfinger with a few changes to dialogue. The film's plot also unfolds with too much coincidence and ease and the dialogue is cringe worthy throughout. The result is the worst Bond script yet written.There is only one word to describe A View To A Kill. That word is uninspired. Worse than being uninspired though, is another fact about the film: that is the worst of the series. From an over the hill 007 to poor casting, a returned emphasis on humor and a script that did little more than rip-off the previous triumphs of the series, the film feels like a parody of the series rather than being a proper film. If not a self- parody then perhaps it is a film that steals from the past to create a film that merely goes through the motions of a formula. The result is a disaster and a clear mandate for a new Bond to take charge.",A View to a Kill
120,Bogmeister,BOND#14: a Final View of the Moore Bond,6,19 July 2007,"MASTER PLAN: flood Silicon Valley in California and corner the microchip market. The eighties were not a particularly good time for the Bond franchise - most of the Bonders were subpar, dominated by an aging Roger Moore and the later new guy Tim Dalton, who lacked a certain charisma. At the center of this mediocrity was this last Moore Bonder, a last gasp and formulaic to a fault. Only after seeing this again recently did I realize how derivative the teaser was, for example - a blatant copy of the ski sequence of ""The Spy Who Loved Me"" - it's one of the more exciting sequences of this film, but that's not saying much, especially as it throws in cutesy scenes and pop tunes, even as Bond takes over a deceased agent 003's mission in a rare somber moment. A lot of this is still entertaining, but in that 'shaking your head, eye rolling' reaction when watching schlock entertainment. The title song is by Duran Duran and, with its disco vibe, it seems outdated as of 20 years ago. If one had never seen a Bond film before this one, this one may seem original, but otherwise, the usual repartee between Bond, Moneypenny, M and Q, for example, seems very old, in more ways than one, virtually duplicating dialog from previous Bonders. Q's gadgets here are no more than a joke, unfortunately. This was a farewell, by the way, for actress Maxwell in the long-running Moneypenny role; appropriately, her final scene has her weeping.Bond's mission takes him to France in the 1st half and involves a lot of horse-racing scenes and getting to the bottom of a problematic microchip conspiracy (it's prescient that Bill Gates was just about to become famous around this time). There's a silly chase in Paris with Bond in a steadily-destroyed automobile and then another very silly one on horses on a rigged track. The 2nd half is in my old hometown of San Francisco, complete with a panoramic view of the Golden Gate near the climax. The main villain, Zorin, is a Bond-world version of Bill Gates, following the super-wealthy megalomaniac mold of Dr.No, Goldfinger, Stromberg and Drax. The actor Walken is well-suited for quirky psychos, but playing a larger-than-life Bond villain is a bit of a stretch for him; he's more at home as traditional gangsters or oddballs. His strange mad cackling was getting tiresome by the end, though he proves to be more intense than the older maniacs of past Bonders and his demise was oddly appropriate - we do look forward to it after he proves to be a genuine mass-murdering psychotic, not just a greedy creep. This film also continues the Soviet connection of the past couple of Bonders, as Zorin is revealed to be a renegade KGB agent (swept away by the opportunities of rampant capitalism, ah yes) and General Gogol was now becoming another regular like M & Q. There's one intriguing bit of nonsense involving Zorin's origins, related to the use of steroids in producing superior, yet crazed, children. But, this is just another sample of weird sci-fi concepts warping the series away from traditional spy stuff, like ""Moonraker"" did before.Curiously, Zorin's artificially-created superiority complex does somewhat explain his sad underestimation of Bond in a couple of scenes - rather than simply shooting him, as many diabolical geniuses fail to do, he leaves Bond to drown or burn; of course, Bond escapes (duh!). Of the other characters, May Day is also over-the-top, a super henchwoman who appears to be into the bad stuff out of love, but Grace Jones never develops beyond the fierce glare of a characterization (as a trivia note, Dolph Lundgren appears in a bit part where he stares at her with more than a passing interest - he and Jones became an item in real life). Former Charlie's Angel and ""Sheena"" actress Ms. Roberts is the latest Bond girl, complete with whiny voice and nearly non-existent acting ability. They also brought in another secret agent, former ""Avengers"" actor Macnee, to assist Bond; he brings a certain amount of class to his scenes, though some of it is played to comic effect, like much of the movie. His role in some scenes as a servant to Bond, however, is a highlight, producing genuine laughs. Zorin's overall mad plan is ludicrous, of course; I don't even know the scientific accuracy of the logistics, but - picture Bill Gates and many of his Microsoft employees, say, planning to drop the San Francisco peninsula into the sea and no one else except one CIA agent knows about it. Moore, in his late fifties here, looked a little better than he did in the previous one ""Octopussy,"" thanks to some, ah, personal tune-ups. But, enough was enough - Moore retired with this Bonder, and Bond would return as Dalton in ""The Living Daylights.""

122,RussHog,Great send off for Roger Moore,9,24 April 2020,Ah - Roger Moore's Bond. He went through many layers with the character. He saved humankind from the bottom of the sea to the crisp of the stars. He had many car chases and fought many bizarre henchmen and masterminds. But through it all - he played the character with a straight face. This final film is a good send off for Moore. The final half hour of the movie is an awesome mess of action and disaster with a classic final battle on the top of the golden gate bridge against a classic villain performance from Christopher Walken. Thank you for your service to Her Majesty - Sir Roger Moore!,A View to a Kill
123,cariart,Moore's Last Bond a Disappointing Throwback...,4,9 April 2004,"Roger Moore, during the filming of OCTOPUSSY, told interviewers that it was about time to turn in his Walther PPK, as he was getting ""too long in the tooth"" to be portraying James Bond.He should have heeded his own advice; instead of ending his reign on the high note of OCTOPUSSY, he would agree to do one more Bond, and A VIEW TO A KILL was simply awful!The creative team of director John Glen, and scriptwriters Richard Maibaum and Michael G. Wilson, who'd rejuvenated 007 with grittier, more physical, less comedy-driven adventures (FOR YOUR EYES ONLY, OCTOPUSSY) rejected the formula in VIEW, opting instead for the overblown comic escapades of DIAMONDS ARE FOREVER and MOONRAKER. While this probably pleased Moore, who, at nearly 58, had always preferred comedy to action, it betrayed the good 'karma' that the recent Bonds had generated with fans.
From the opening sequence, shot in Iceland and Switzerland, of Bond snowboarding to elude Russian ski troops, ultimately joining a comely lass in a motorized 'iceberg' getaway, the film feels artificial. As Moore pulls down the hood of his parka, his facial features are so stretched and mask-like that one suspects he'd had plastic surgery done between films, and the results had gone awry.The story, of genetically-'improved' madman, Max Zorin (a youthful, blond-haired Christopher Walken), with a plan to flood Silicon Valley, destroying America's 'hold' on the world's microchip technology, was already passé by 1985 (Japan had long since passed us), and seemed merely an excuse to bounce Bond around Paris, Ascot, and California for some flashy stunts, like a parachute leap off the Eiffel Tower, or a firetruck chase through San Francisco. Although Zorin and Bond 'size each other up', it is Zorin's mistress, May Day (Grace Jones), who appears the most formidable. The black singer/model, tall, muscular, and ferocious, is so intimidating that the aging Bond's bedding of her is patently unreal (looking fragile, Moore seems more likely for heart failure after a night with her than an orgasm!)As the film's 'sacrificial lamb', 63-year old Patrick Macnee (the legendary star of ""The Avengers"" TV series that also provided one of Bond's greatest leading ladies, Diana Rigg), is the most welcome ingredient of the film. A cousin of David Niven's, Macnee and Moore had been friends for years, and had done the TV-movie, ""Sherlock Holmes in New York"" together, in 1976 (with Moore as Holmes, and Macnee as Watson). As a trainer who suspects Zorin of using performance-enhancing substances on his horses, the 'old pros' are delightful together, in scenes often ad-libbed. Moore's reaction to his murder is both simple and profound, a rarity in this film.Then there is ""Charlie's Angel"" Tanya Roberts, as Bond's love interest, geologist Stacey Sutton. Chosen by Albert Broccoli on the basis of her performance in THE BEASTMASTER (which should give you an indication that 'Shakespeare in the Park' ISN'T in her resume), the 29-year old actress is epically bad, breathlessly chanting ""Oh, James!"" and frowning and pouting to convey 'deep' emotion. Until Denise Richards' even more inept performance as 'Christmas Jones' in THE WORLD IS NOT ENOUGH, Roberts would hold the title of ""Worst Bond Leading Lady"". One almost wishes that Zorin and Bond, in their climactic fight on the Golden Gate Bridge, might have thrown HER off!In a bizarre twist, the worst Bond film would have one of the best theme songs, as Duran Duran's ""A View to a Kill"" would hit #1 on the U.S. pop charts.Despite the regret Eon Productions expressed, as Roger Moore announced this would DEFINITELY be his last Bond film, no one argued his decision, and no call would be made begging him to return again. James Bond needed a major overhaul, and a younger, tougher, more dynamic actor to pull it off...and there were, not one, but TWO candidates, waiting in the wings...",A View to a Kill
124,Rickting,One of the biggest Bond duds,3,28 June 2015,"A View to a Kill is another misfire from the ever unsatisfactory Roger Moore and could be the worst in the franchise. It's hard to choose between this and Moonraker, but at least you can actually remember what happens in Moonraker. This time, Bond is investigating computer chips, horses and eventually comes face to face with Christopher Walken (on excellent form) as he battles to stop a horrifying (and hugely unrealistic) cataclysm. AVTAK is enjoyable at times when you're in the right mood thanks to its humour and like with every Bond film it's always cool to see the Bond formula but this is weighed down by an elderly Bond, a complete lack of gadgets, lame action and arguably the Worst Bond Girl of all time. This veers into near comedy too often and although it can work it doesn't feel serious enough and often just doesn't feel like a Bond film. Grace Jones makes an interesting henchwoman and Christopher Walken is a genuinely fine villain, but Tanya Roberts is atrocious and Roger Moore gives his worst performance as Bond. The fact that he looks ancient compared to the other Bond actors in this doesn't help.The Paris action sequence is good and the Golden Gate Bridge finale is sometimes palm sweating but it's all flatly filmed throughout and John Glen doesn't inject any passion or glamour into the film. They decided to play the Beach Boys during the opening action scene which rips off The Spy Who Loved Me and there's a terrible sequence involving a fire engine which just isn't thrilling and has Bond acting extremely foolishly. The lack of energy is noticeable and very off putting, while the plot lacks charisma, originality and escapism. It's not as absurd as certain other instalments but there's a very good reason why this is lowest ranked on Rotten Tomatoes out of the 50 year old franchise. So- if you're in the right mood this might be bearable at times. If you're not, you will slightly hate it. This does go into enjoyably bad territory so it's not unwatchable but there's just no heart and no care put into this creaking Bond entry. The thing to compare it to is that car crash in Casino Royale. That's a good visual representation of AVTAK.3/10",A View to a Kill
125,grendelkhan,Roger should have stepped down sooner.,5,30 November 2012,"A View to a Kill presents us with another Roger Moore Bond; but, Roger is really showing his age in this one. Well, let's face it, from For Your Eyes Only onward, he was looking more and more like he should have been shipped out to The Village (rest home for all the old spies, don't you know?). Moore is rather embarrassing in this one, looking like someone's grandfather, not the debonair hero he started out to be. He tries, though; but he isn't aided by a script produced via committee and a very weak female lead in Tanya Roberts.The plot is rather convoluted and silly. A product of eugenics is trying to destroy Silicon Valley to drive up the value of his own microchips. Yeah, not exactly world threatening stuff here.Christopher Walken is good, as usual, though his character isn't really put to its best use. I think we could have come up with a better motivation for our psycho to play to Walken's strengths. Grace Jones would have been fine if she hadn't been given lines. A female bodyguard/henchperson is a nice idea, but she can't deliver a single line without sounding like she's in a bad high school production. Tanya Roberts is another who just isn't up to the level that Bond should require. Poor Patrick McNee is wasted in little more than a cameo, when he could have done so much more. If you are going to have John Steed with James Bond, take advantage of it! The stunts descend into further silliness, though at least we don't have any Tarzan yells, and the battle atop the Golden Gate Bridge is pretty good. Really, the problems, aside from the aging lead and miscast ladies, is a mediocre script.This just feels like a bunch of ideas were thrown into a pot and then drawn out and pasted into a script, whether it made sense or not. Part of the problem was that the filmmakers had run out of ideas for villains and situation that would require a James Bond to handle. Zorin would have made a more interesting assassin or a nihilist, out to create chaos and destruction. Walken certainly seems to enjoy playing his imbalanced side, so run with that. As it stands, he is the only thing that keeps you interested in the plot. The romantic angle falls flat, between bad acting from Roberts and the age difference. Bond looks like an old lech here, not a sophisticated ladies man. It was probably time to turn the franchise over back with Octopussy, but it definitely was here.In the end, it's not the worst film (Die Another Day has a firm lock on that, in my book) but it's definitely in the bottom few. If you have to watch this, do it for Walken's scenes because there is little else to satisfy.",A View to a Kill

127,FilmFanInTheHouse,Moore's Bond just cant be taken serious no more,7,12 February 2007,"It seems to be the trend to have your last Bond film not as good as the others. Connery has Diamonds are Forever, Pierce Brosnan has Die Another Day and Roger Moore has A View To A Kill. The problem is similar to Never Say Never Again. Roger Moore is just too old. The big action sequences in his previous feels really helped you believe it was in fact Roger Moore character in danger. In this film, there are so many blatant attempts of a stunt double used, that when Bond moves, such as rolling over, you really hard to take it seriously. Moore just doesn't look like who would be able to perform it.His style of Bond also seems to wear thin in this film. Although us the audience know that jokey nature of this Bond, its easy to feel as if we've already heard it before. The other characters are a mixed bag, The are some real gems such as Max Zorin and Sir Godfrey Tibbett, and some real annoying characters such as Stacy Sutton with her annoying girl-next-door character and May Day, who most of the time looks as if she can bend in any possible way.John Barry has really seemed to have lost his imagination in the film. The main title theme sung by Duran Duran isn't fantastic and often loses its impact by the end of the film. During the film, it really seems like there's only two pieces of music present. An action piece of music and an instrumental version of the theme. There's bound to be other pieces of music, but i only remember these 2.AVTAK isn't a complete disaster.

128,jhaggardjr,Roger Moore's 007 finale,8,27 May 2000,"""A View to a Kill"", the 14th James Bond picture, is a ridiculously well made 007 film with Roger Moore giving his last performance as Bond. Moore seemed to be the James Bond that clowned around the most, and that should be said because ""A View to a Kill"" is without question the funniest James Bond movie to date. Parts of the film are downright hilarious. Some of it is absolutely ridiculous. But I enjoyed it anyway. It was appropriate for Moore to retire from the series after this one, because by the time this movie came out, he was getting too old to play Bond. Most people agreed with this, especially the critics. Nevertheless, Moore's send-off is a pretty good one. This time Bond faces off against Academy Award winner Christopher Walken who plays the out-of-control villain Max Zorin, and rock singer Grace Jones who plays the even more out-of-control villainess May Day. These villains is what makes this movie tick. Plus, they're funny. Tanya Roberts plays Stacey Sutton, the Bond girl who teams up with Bond and tries to help him save the day. Roberts is one of the weaker Bond girls, but she's not the worst (that honor still belongs to Britt Ekland's brainless Goodnight for ""The Man with the Golden Gun""). As for the stunts and action scenes, they're first-rate as usual. Same goes for the locations which include San Francisco (mostly) and Paris (briefly). But the best thing about ""A View to a Kill"" is that it's so funny, and Roger Moore's humor obviously contributed to that. I remember one time when I was watching this with my best friend, and he constantly kept cracking jokes during several key scenes. Every time I've watched this movie since, I keep thinking of those jokes when those scenes turn up. It's great. ""A View to a Kill"" is a delightful action comedy that turned out to be a good finale for Roger Moore. It also marks the final appearance of Lois Maxwell as the original Miss Moneypenny (she was wonderful). Plus, it has (in my opinion) the best theme song written for a 007 picture (sung by Duran Duran). Lots of fun.*** (out of four)",A View to a Kill
129,MattBrady099,Time to hang up the suit Moore,4,27 November 2014,"Even Christopher Walken as the main villain couldn't save this movie. The story is about James Bond himself as he returns from Russia with a computer chip cable of surviving the EMP of a nuclear blast. Zorin industries is responsible and Bond uncovers a plot to corner the chip market and destroy Silicon Valley in the process. Last august a good friend of my asked me, ""What's you least favorite Bond film out there?"", and it took me about a year to find the worst Bond film out there. Until I watched For Your Eyes Only which I thought wasn't good at all. I tried and search like crazy to find the worst Bond film out there, it was like my destiny to find the worst. Until came across A View to a Kill, and this movie is flat out awful in many ways possible.Is it just me or Roger Moore got on my nerves in this movie, maybe it's the cheesy puns or just the writing, but anywhere in this movie Moore didn't look like he cared at all during most of the scenes, it's like watching a cardboard box with arms and legs moving around during the big action scenes, not caring at all. The villain in this movie blows and I hate saying that because I know Christopher Walken could have been a great villain but due to bad screen writing and poor delivery, that ruined a great chance of a great, fun and maybe Walken's best performances that will be remember through time lines of Bond villains, that sadly that did happen here, I mean Walken could have been like Christopher Lee villain in The Man with the Golden Gun. Tanya Roberts in this movie is completely awful and totally missed cast. No wonder she got nominated for a Golden Raspberry Awards for worst acting for this movie. The movie itself feels like a straight up comedy spoof. The stunts are very noticeable and sometimes kind of messy. This is a James Bond film with messy stunts, a boring Villain and Bond getting under me skin; what kind of film is this?! I'm shocked by this.Now you probably asking yourself, ""Is they anything good in is?"", the movie doesn't look that bad, the movie is actually pretty well shot at times and even the theme song is pretty good and the only thing that stops me from giving this a lower rating.The best way to describe this movie can go something like this: A View to a Kill is like a rocky, bumpy roll coaster ride that you just wish it would end anytime soon.",A View to a Kill

It's more likely that I had this movie in mind. Managed to stay awake all the way through this time, as an Australian free to air TV station is now showing all the Bond movies in sequence. Sure, it had some interesting elements, but it's not enough to make me think that this was a movie which really needed to be made.A central character in this movie is super-rich...all the perks of the landed gentry...which is what makes this movie seem like something Jane Austen might have flirted with...or ""Lifestyles of the rich and famous"". For a Bond movie, it has little wit to it.Exotic locations: Paris, San Francisco.Plot: A microchip which is immune to the magnetic pulse of a nuclear blast has been developed for Britain, giving it a tactical edge against the Soviet Union. However, when the company manufacturing the chip is taken over by a private company, the Soviets may secretly get their hands on the technology.

In fact, The Power Station had their first hit before this movie was released...maybe some cross over influence here? The visuals for this song seems to contain beautiful women dancing with glow in the dark dildos...but don't quote me on that! Silly female character names - May Day. OK, that's not over the top. Jenny Flex...get it?Sexism/misogyny - Bond is patronising at times...or maybe he's being avuncular? Wine fetish - Bond orders ""Bollinger '75"". This brand is mentioned in the end credits. In case you are wondering if this displays good or bad taste, he is complimented as a ""connoisseur"" for this order. Hmm...seem to remember reading somewhere that actual wine buffs think that the movie Bond has less than connoisseur taste! Q -He's back. The usual guy...Connery's last turn as Bond a few years previously (in ""Never say never again"") had a new character with that moniker. And the relationship between Bond and Q isn't as unpleasantly poisonous as it was in Moore's previous movie, ""Octopussy"".End teaser - Yes, but no specific title, just ""James Bond will return"".Watch out for: * Christopher Walken's boyishly nerdy psychopath. One of the good elements to this movie.* Bond recovering a chip from 003 in Siberia...seeing other ""00s"" is rare in this franchise.* a lesson in ee-nun-cee-ay-shun by Bond...pretending to be St.John Smith...it's actually pronounced sin-gin-smythe. Ah, those Hyphenated-Names! * the facial equivalent of incontinence by Moore...he seems to have lost all control of his expressions in this movie! He smirks creepily at times in this movie...like when told of the price of a horse for sale...doesn't really come across as very upper class here!* May Day making Bond look frail in the castle. May Day actually has an interesting arc as a character in this movie...which is another good thing about this movie. May Day looks like she could suggest to Bond that she was going to use a dildo on him and there's not a damn thing he can do about it! Yes, Moore looks his age here. It took one more movie for this to happen than it did Lois Maxwell (as Moneypenny).* Chuck Lee, C.I.A...what on Earth is his accent? * I missed him, but Dolph Lundgren has a role in this movie as ""Venz"".* microchips...in horses! * Bond gets Order Of Lenin from Gogol. Not sure if this is the last time that Gogol appears in this franchise.* James Bond's cover identity...James Stock, London Financial Times. See what he did there? Notes to self: Surete means? Pola Ivanova...has she appeared in previous Bond movies? hmm...not sure about the plausibility of the evil scheme at the heart of this movie. Not sure if the notion of ""double earthquakes"" seals the issue or not!Conclusion: Christopher Walken plays a different kind of Bond villain...more willing to do the dirty work himself, up close. He's interesting. Grace Jones as May Day ends up having an interesting story arc. But these pluses aren't enough to lift this movie above ""mediocre"". Roger Moore started his reign as Bond in a dull way (Live and let die) and his final turn has symmetry as far as dullness goes.",A View to a Kill
131,Angeneer,"Bad, but it doesn't take itself seriously",6,26 January 2000,"The production? Nice stunts and effects paired with idiotic dialogues and jokes that make you cry. The cast? Roger Moore played a character who couldn't be his age, Grace Jones' only goal was to confirm her vamp status, Tanya Roberts proved that there can be roles that require no brain cell usage and Chris Walken initiated his trademark, psychotic roles. The movie? You won't miss anything special, unless you're a hardcore Bond fan.

A View to a Kill is a great James Bond film, Christopher Walken did a great job as the Bond Villain, Grace Jones did a great job as May Day, Roger Moore still does a great job as James Bond. Like other Bond films A View to a Kill has a song performed by a famous artist or group, this time the group is Duran Duran and the song is called ""A View to a Kill"" which is a pretty good song. A View to a Kill is another great Bond film that should be seen by Bond fans and people who's new to the series.

133,willcundallreview,Underrated kind of OK Bond fun,6,7 May 2014,"Rating-6/10A View to a Kill is a Bond film that although never quite hits the heights of previous instalments, still in my opinion let's Moore leave the role with a fun film that isn't so much good but is also far from bad either. With a punch and a kick this is one of Moore's most fighting like films and I appreciated the down to basics approach that the film makers took on here, He also does all sorts of other things which is why I felt that this film was strongly kind of OK, and here below is why.The story is not the most great and awesome story Bond has ever taken on but he conducts in a manner which suggests it is a much more serious thing than what it really is in the end. Set around many luxury estates and others such places, A View to a Kill travels to some nice places and for the story this wraps around well and although parts can be more boring and seem unnecessary, the story is nevertheless entertaining. I felt it took on a darker tone for the first real times and the villain actually seemed quite hell bent on completing his massive objective.Roger Moore goes out with a movie which won't enthral everyone and although I felt here that Moore fights hand to hand more than any other, he still seems just too old and unable to do stunts well enough. Christopher Walken as the villain is not too bad and as I said the darker tones lead to him becoming one of the first if not the first villain to have very evil traits let alone his world plans. Everyone else does there job but other than Walken no one truly stands out, Grace Jones and her slightly intimidating character leave a scary imprint on your mind, the character is played superbly sinister.John Glen did a good job here and is one the saving factors for me even though people heckle this move so much. Written not so great it is still fun and with some fun stunts and nice fight scenes it makes for probably the only movie that is dark yet very humorous. I especially loved the car scene in Paris which in well I won't ruin it but let's just say that Bond really knows how to drive a cut car and then also at the same time catch up to the people he is after.The film's main criticism usually is and rightly so is the fact that Roger Moore was 57 when he did this and was just way too old to portray this Bond he was showing. I also disliked the maybe parts of the film where you have Moore being humorous or light and the villain being overly dark as the two just don't mix and you could even say that for this one, the villain actually is overshadowing the performance of Roger Moore.Bond fans will possibly like this although I think it depends on when and who is Bond because this is as I say a mix of light heartedness with darkness and sometimes fails to blend. Those who like a good crime mystery may like it as Walken's villain is kind of hard to figure out at times and what comes next is never predicted and so a mystery thriller which a good one of that ensues here. Finally those who like Moore's comedy may be disappointed as he takes a more serious turn here although he isn't completely without joke.Overall I give this a 6/10 meaning it was Strongly OK-ish, I think although this is nowhere near being good let alone OK, the film is underrated and definitely not a Bad or Poor one. Just enjoy Moore in his swansong and wave goodbye to longest serving Bond, whether you like him or dislike him he still has brought Bond to the forefront over his 12 years and made some truly memorable moments.",A View to a Kill
134,majikstl,"""A chance to find a phoenix for the flame""",5,17 November 2006,"You don't review James Bond movies, you evaluate them, rate them according to how well they meet expectations. There are certain things one has come to expect, even demand of a Bond film and each individual effort either delivers or it doesn't. So, here are ten elements that make a Bond film a Bond film and how A VIEW TO A KILL rates on a scale of 1 to 10: Title: A VIEW TO A KILL; Probably -- no, definitely -- the worse title for a Bond movie. Oddly poetic, I suppose, but also vaguely meaningless. 3 points. Pre-credits teaser: Another ski chase across a snowy landscape, another exploding helicopter and another disguised submarine: tiresomely unoriginal, but acceptable. But pumping up The Beach Boys on the soundtrack as Bond snowboards down the mountain is just plain desperation. The Tarzan yell in OCTOPUSSY was enough to make you roll your eyes, but this just makes you cringe. 3 points.Opening credits: Poor Maurice Binder is obviously running out of inspiration. Really, naked skiers and neon pistols that shoot lasers (or are they squirt guns shooting paint?). Gaudy and just plain ugly, the use of black light and infrared colors was bad enough in Wham! videos, but are beneath the dignity of a Bond film. 1 point.Theme song: Recorded by Duran Duran during their brief moment as pop stars, the song can generously be described as nonsensical. The music itself is catchy enough, I suppose, but the lyrics about ""dancing into the fire"" has nothing to do with Binder's ice and snow motif and even less to do with the impending earthquake of the actual story. Maybe it is in reference to the coming fire engine chase. Lines like ""To drench your skin with lover's rosy stain / A chance to find a phoenix for the flame:"" Not good, not good at all. 2 points.""Bond, James Bond"": It is Roger Moore's swansong as Bond and he does nothing to disgrace himself. Though he does look a bit ill at ease in the love scene with Grace Jones -- but who wouldn't? And let's face it, that is obviously not Moore doing those stunts. Still, he deserves 7 points just for plugging along like a good soldier.Bond Babes: For sheer contrast it is hard to beat Tanya Roberts and Grace Jones as costars. Roberts' Stacey Sutton is certainly whiny and more than a bit annoying. Yet she isn't an agent, but a civilian who gets sucked into the convoluted adventure and provides a few laughs as the comic relief. But with her squeaky clean sexiness she is certainly overshadowed by Jones' May Day, whose exotic appearance alone is a major asset/distraction. Strangely frightening as both a love interest and a villainess, she almost blows it all with one line of dialogue (""He said he loved me!""). But she is undeniably unforgettable. And let's toss in an extra point for Fiona Fullerton's hot tub cameo as an easily seduced Russia agent. 9 points.Bond Villain: As many creepy, wacky, weirdo, psycho nutcases as he has played, you'd think Christopher Walken would be a natural as a Bond villain. Alas, that is not the case; as Max Zorin, he seems vaguely uninterested in even being in the movie. Perhaps playing a maniacal, mass-murderer just didn't offer him much of a challenge. Rates 6 points simply because he seems to get off on firing a machine gun at innocent people.Bond Baddies: With Jones doing double duty as a love interest and a femme fatale, Patrick Bauchau and Willoughby Gray hardly make an impression as Zorin's underlings. 4 points.Sinister Plot: Walken's Zorin is supposedly a criminal mastermind, though his most daring crime it seems is ripping off the sinister plot from SUPERMAN THE MOVIE. Like Lex Luthor before him, Zorin hopes to set off a series of earthquakes designed to sink large portions of California, allowing him to cash in on the aftermath. Evil, undoubtedly; but far-fetched even for Bond's universe. Still, it seems to be a dependable plot. (Note to the Bond producers: Get Gene Hackman to play your next evil archenemy. He knows how to do it well.) 7 points. Production values: Just when you are all set to give up on the movie as being a major disappointment, they trot out a couple of Bond's all time best action sequences: a fire engine chase through San Francisco and an ending with a shootout involving a blimp on top of the Golden Gate Bridge. Cool, and outrageously improbable. 9 points.Bonus Points: The Bond people slapped around Cathy Gale (Honor Blackman in GOLDFINGER), assassinated Emma Peel (Diana Rigg in ON HER MAJESTY'S SECRET SERVICE) and now, as if to complete their vendetta against ""The Avengers,"" they knock off John Steed. Kudos to the producers for bringing on board the wonderful Patrick Macnee as Bond's latest doomed sidekick, but raspberries to them for both killing him and doing it in such a inglorious manner. Minus 5 points.""Summary: There is a certain irony to the title, as watching A VIEW TO A KILL isn't so much like watching a death as the end of an era. Moore bows out of the series with grace; and though he has been criticized heavily for giving the Bond films a more comical slant, it is easy to look back at his bemused approach to the character with a certain affection. At least Moore would risk showing some sort of emotion beyond grim determination, which can't be said for his successors. It is however sad that with the lackluster A VIEW TO A KILL he exits the role with more of a whimper than a bang.Bond-o-meter Rating: 46 points out of 100.",A View to a Kill
135,michaelarmer,A View To A Shag,8,31 March 2020,"This is the best Roger Moore Bond Film, just pipping Live and Let Die and The Man with the Golden Gun. Apparently its Moore's least favourite, because it's more violent, but it is more serious and has more drama in it. Moore must have liked it when it was dafter.They left out almost all the daft stuff, the Beach Boys music when snowboarding, and the ice-boat in the intro, were a bit silly, after that it was great, well directed and well paced, good music, and excellent photography, the scenery was fantastic. The title song was pretty good as well. Most of the locations were authentic, except for Siberia which was faked without any main actors and in Iceland and old Swiss footage.All of Moore's action scenes used a double, and you can tell, he was past it, other than that he was good, Christopher Walken was excellent as the evil psychotic Zorin, a class actor. Other notables were Patrick McNee as Tibbet, Grace Jones playing a crazed henchwoman, she is not a good actor, she just played herself, but that was good in this. Aged English actor Willoughby Gray played Dr. Carl Mortner well despite being the wrong nationality. Oh and Lois Maxwell played Moneypenny for the last time, she was in tears in her final scene, she passed away in 2007 and will be sadly missed.Bond Themes:- MI6 crew, Ski scenes, Helicopters, KGB (Walter Gotell again), CIA but with Chuck Lee (David Yip from Liverpool) instead of Leiter and another Airship, but no Train scene/Festival/Cable Car/Belly Dancer.
Cars- a few Renault's in France including a daft scene where Bond drives one that is cut in half, but the star was the Rolls Royce Silver Phantom II, one of the most beautiful cars of all time. Henchmen: - the main one was a Henchwoman - May Day (Grace Jones) and Scarpine (Patrick Bauchau) who was poor. There were a few gadgets but they did not detract from the film.
Bond Girls:- 4 in this and Bond hit the Bed running again, shagging Kimberley (no. 45) in the intro, played by another Swede ex Miss World Mary Stavin, and very nice too, she was in Octopussy as an extra, but got a better role here, she should have been a main 'Bond Girl' in at least one of them. Next up was MayDay (no.46) Grace Jones of Jamaica, not the best looking but more of a physical challenge for an ageing Bond, she was a baddie as the henchwoman however did turn to good at the end, but still got killed, No. 3 in this (no.47) was Pola Ivanova (Fiona Fullerton - English Model, and lastly the main 'Bond Girl' was Stacey Sutton (no. 48) played by Tanya Roberts (USA) also extremely pretty but with too much make-up, Bond shagged her at the end. Mary Stavin, Fiona Fullerton and Tanya Roberts were 3 of the best beauties in all the 007 franchise in one film, I reckon Fiona was the best looking, just.A few daft bits, but not too much to affect the quality, the best bits were the dramatic fire in San Francisco City Hall, The Fire Engine chase and the Airship over Golden gate Bridge, all cracking scenes. A pity they did not make the last few like this, at least Roger Moore got a good send off.",A View to a Kill
136,malkane316,Quick Reviews!!,7,15 February 2005,"It is clear, and everyone always mentions it, that Moore is getting too old to play the suave secret agent, especially here as he flies around mind shafts, dangles off the Golden Gate bridge, horse races, and fights Mayday. However, Moore still does a good job, and it is a good film with some fantastic performances, and the usual good mix of stunts, action and humour. In other words, it's a good old-fashioned Bond film. Though clearly a product of the eighties, it is not bogged down too much by the era's annoyances. The theme tune by Duran Duran is one of the best, the cars and gadgets are cool, and the hair and clothes aren't too bad.Bond is chasing the wonderfully evil Max Zorin, played brilliantly by Christopher Walken, who plans to destroy Silicon Valley. When i was younger I didn't think this was much of a diabolical scheme, but I didn't really know what Silicon Valley was. However, I knew that Zorin guy had to be stopped- letting people slide out of his Zeppelin to their deaths, and trapping people in tubes with giant spinning fans at the bottom- the guy is the devil. Zorin would become the world leader in computer chips if he destroyed the Valley, killing millions as he did it. Bond, with the 'help' of Stacey tries to stop Zorin and his crew, including the deadly Mayday, played perfectly by Grace Jones. Zorin's sinister actions lead to a number of deaths, including friend's of Bond's, and Bond eventually finds himself trying to detonate Zorin's bomb. Soon the two are fighting hundreds of feet in the air, and it looks like Bond may not win.Walken and Jones are what stand out here. They seem to be equally devoted to each other, and equally insane, although Zorin proves to have no remorse for his actions. He shows little grief at Mayday's downfall. He is clearly a sociopath and must be stopped. The fights are good, although Moore cannot really handle the stunts anymore, Roberts is quite annoying but that suits her character who doesn't do anything. It was time for someone else to take over, but this was a good conclusion to Moore's time as Bond.7 out of 10",A View to a Kill

138,mOVIemAN56,Moore's Best,9,7 April 2005,"Roger Moore wasn't exactly a likable James Bond to me. Too much humor was added to his films and the plots were never good. A View to a Kill made Moore leave with a bang, however. Bond is back on his usual personal mission, driving cars and charming woman but is called to duty. Bond is sent to investigate a security-leak inside the high-tech Zorin Corporation. Bond secretly comes to the house of the man who runs the company, Max Zorin (Christopher Walken). Zorin plans to corner the world microchip market by killing millions in Silicon Valley. Bond must confront Zorin and his beautiful yet deadly companion May Day (Grace Jones). With the help of Stacey (Tanya Roberts) Bond launches an all-out assault against Zorin.The score for the film is one of the best I've heard. Roger Moore brought probably the only good Bond film of the 80's and brings the secret agent to a new level of fighting and strength. Walken tops as no.2 for my favorite Bond villain(Trevelyan being no.1). He's cunning and yet charming.The only problem is Tanya Roberts as the Bond girl. She really had no point but I guess every Bond needs a girl, even if annoying.A View to a Kill.

139,OttoVonB,Bond 14: Moore's to pity...,4,11 June 2007,"Lame jokes aside, you know by the title (and most reviews) that this Bond film is - to be polite and give it the benefit of doubt - not very popular.Microchip guru Max Zorin (Crhistopher Walken) seems to be playing both sides of the cold war, as well as fixing horse races and planing a sinister plot against his rivals in Syllicone Valley. Bond investigates, disguised as a horse enthusiast (taming Grace Jones in the process to appear more credible). Double-crosses, assassination attempts and zeppelin madness quickly follow.""View To a Kill"" starts off strong with a mostly competent ski/snowboard chase (undone by ridiculous use of a Beach Boys song) and an enjoyable theme song by Duran-Duran. It then proceeds with one of the most plodding plots in 007 history. This, ladies and gentlemen, is the end of the Moore bond era. Unconvincing in fight scenes, Moore is actually at his worse with ladies, at a used up 59 years old. The cruelest jibe was given by Empire reviewers, who deemed that ""he had aged so horribly that he could check himself in as his own luggage"". Not quite the suave secret agent we all hope for, is it? The only way to make matters worse was to pair him with Patrick McNee, which the film-makers did! The rest is barely worth mentioning. John Barry's rousing score and Grace Jones's wild fury aside, this film has little to offer, beyond the ability to waste Christopher Walken.The king is dead (in agony). Long live Timothy Dalton!",A View to a Kill
140,mnpollio,Moore's final Bond film is underrated,7,29 March 2007,"A lot of Bond fans love to take pot-shots at the final Roger Moore Bond film, but I think it is one of his better ones (truly can many watch The Man With the Golden Gun or Moonraker without cringing?).Bond: Moore is really showing his age here, so it is appropriate that he finally left the franchise at this point. Still, he does give the part his all, even if he amps up the comedy at the expense of any edge to the character.The villains: Surprisingly, Christopher Walken is dismissed in the pantheon of great Bond villains, but I find his platinum-blond nutcase to be both a memorable Bond villain and a welcome addition to Walken's gallery of wackos.The women: Grace Jones is an intimidating presence as henchwoman May Day, but the film makes the ludicrous mistake of defanging her prior to the climax. I would love to have seen a fight scene between the physically underwhelming Moore and the primal Jones. Tanya Roberts, as geologist Stacy Sutton, is gorgeous - then she opens her mouth. She is one of the less enigmatic Bond women and she alternates between ineffective action and being cluelessly docile. Her madcap chase piloting a fire truck through San Francisco would have been more effective if the actress had any comic timing. However, her elaborate geological overview of Walken's dastardly plan, seriously explained to Bond late in the film does make for unintentional comedy.The plot is strangely cluttered until it finally settles on a typical plot to destroy Silicon Valley. The locations are, for the most part, exotic and the action is fast-paced. It is also nice to see ex-Avengers star Patrick Macnee in an all-too-brief role as a Bond compatriot. The title track by Duran Duran is one of the better endeavors and would be the last Bond song to make much impression. All in all a typical Bond film and an acceptable swan song to the Moore era.",A View to a Kill
141,EvanKevelson,I was disappointed at ten years of age,1,26 February 2021,"Roger you were 58 going on 67 you did a ridiculous entertaining film with an Evil Aquaman, followed by hack films and bad scripts, an Adolph of Space and return of Jaws (A Hack of eggbeater claw hands in your debut) you were over 50 after 1977. For some of these you went hunting through sunken British ships, mountain climbing, and A LOT of skiing scenes. The bulk of your Bond work made it into a Geek Fest or children's movies from Moonraker on till a movie so bad had to be maid to justify any replacement. In that sense you succeeded. At that time and now I have the same opinion and feeling ""Find me a Connery Substitute or a new take"".
This final Moore couldn't be redeemed even if you renamed it Austin Powers the Prequel.
Bonds first interracial dalliance how liberal. 4 years after The Deer Hunter I scratch my head trying to understand why Christopher Walken would agree to be in this Farce. The effects the close ups on the Golden Gate looked ridiculous. The shape he looked like, there were no ED pills yet so how you can perform after riding a horse is medically mind boggling.",A View to a Kill
142,Thrashman88,Had potential...,5,20 July 2014,"A VIEW TO A KILL, the last time we saw Roger Moore play James Bond, had a lot of promise but eventually succumbed to a badly developed storyline. Max Zorin is an eccentric millionaire who enjoys racing and breeding horses and has many companies. He is the baddie in this installment of the franchise. One of his companies makes computer chips which he believes will rule the world. In order for him to rule the market, he has to erase the competition, who in this case is Silicon Valley itself in Northern California. The premise is great and if, done with a bit more care, it would've been among the best Bond films in a while. There's a subplot of genetic engineered horses and a hint that Max Zorin himself is also part of this engineering, but it's dropped like hot potatoes and never addressed in the movie's climatic finale. The movie looks extremely dated, even more so than earlier movies like THE SPY WHO LOVED ME or FOR YOUR EYES ONLY. As much as I enjoy DURAN DURAN, I think it was an ill advised choice to have them sing the title song. It's not a bad song per sé, it's just NOT a James Bond movie song. As for Roger Moore, besides his decidedly old age appearance, he emits an air of disinterest and seems to just ""walk through"" the movie. There in no chemistry between him and Tanya Roberts, as hot as she was back then. She looks like she could easily be his daughter.The movie's pace picks up considerably (as with almost ALL Bond films) at the end giving us some grand views of San Francisco's Bay Area. It's no wonder Moore himself disliked the movie and although it's always fun to watch Christopher Walken, his role could've been performed by anyone (Rutger Hauer would've been a wonderful choice). Grace Jones looks weird as usual but she had the most menacing presence during the movie.A VIEW TO A KILL isn't the absolute worst as some here might say. It has its moments. It definitely isn't anything to rave home about either. It had the potential to be a real good Bond movie, but somethings just didn't gel...",A View to a Kill

We come with good luck from the villains: another hierarchical actor who makes up a very good character. Cristopher Walken is a great actor.

144,williampsamuel,Surprisingly Bad for Bond,4,11 April 2019,"A View to a Kill, the fourteenth entry in the James Bond series, brings great promise. It features not only beautiful San Francisco, but also Christopher Walken as the villain, Max Zorin. You know Walken; he's the guy with the piercing blue eyes, the low, smooth voice and the all around aura of creepiness. Not since Christopher Lee in The Man with the Golden Gun has the series had an actor as fit for the role of villain. Unfortunately, like Golden Gun, this movie mostly squanders its potential.View has three main problems, the budget, the star, and the script. Following the successful but astronomically expensive Moonraker, Eon Productions placed a budget cap on the series, but they forgot to adjust for inflation. What was plenty in '79 was barely adequate by '85, and the effects suffer accordingly. A few scenes that might have been shot on location are instead done against backdrops, and scale models are too often used in place of actual buildings and vehicles.As for the star of the picture, you may be asking, ""What could be wrong with Roger Moore after six previous films?"" Simple, he was fifty seven. Although fifty seven is by no means too old to act, even in an action movie, it's certainly too old to play James Bond. Moore still gives off great charm, but he shows difficulty in performing some of the action scenes, and he's almost old enough to be the father of this film's Bond girl.And then there's the script. The main plotline about a psychotic French industrialist with Soviet and Nazi connections plus bad designs for the city of San Francisco is sound, and most of the action sequences are good ideas. But the screenplay has a strange way of undermining itself. Take the opening ski chase. True, this is familiar territory for Bond, but it's well executed, and I was quite impressed when he used a piece of a helicopter as a snowboard- right until the Beach Boys' ""California Girls"" started playing. What the hell were they thinking? And the part where Zorin guns down his own men really establishes his character, but it was dragged out way too long. A few bursts of gunfire would be more effective then the endless bloodbath.There were parts I liked. I found the steeplechase sequence quite exciting, especially towards the end. And sets for the abandoned mine were quite impressive, as were the scenes of its destruction. Best of all was part with city hall set on fire. It generated real suspense, and the setup was ingenious. I also kinda liked the female lead, Stacy Sutton (--). She's no Honey Rider, but she is plucky and fairly intelligent. I had no trouble believing her as a geologist.A View to a Kill isn't a terrible movie- that would be very hard for an official Bond film. But it's not a particularly good movie either. The idea is sound, but the execution is often flawed. It's still watchable, and at times entertaining, but it's far from being everything that a Bond movie should be.",A View to a Kill

""A View to a Kill"" follows a much older looking Bond (57-year-old Moore), as he rides horses, takes down blimps, and runs on top of a bridge. With a laughable villain in Christopher Walken, there is some enjoyment to be had with this film, even though it is not good enjoyment. With one-liners at a new low, a villain that is not interesting, excess build-up to a disappointing finale, and an atmosphere that is way too far from the feel of bond, this film fails on many levels.

147,jonathanruano,A View to a Kill,3,6 October 2009,"Pardon the pun, but John Glen, the writers and Roger Moore (James Bond) have practically killed this movie. I cannot imagine a Bond movie more pointless, more dull and more uninspired than ""A View to a Kill."" Aside from an exciting sky chase (mostly stunt work) in the beginning to a great score from John Barry, this movie has the excitement of an old peoples' home. James Bond (Roger) just looks too old to do all the things you would expect a Bond to do, like seduce young women, battle bad guys, perform amazing stunts and just be Bond. Of course, Roger Moore was never really that good of a Bond, but his performance here looks like that of your grandpa crashing the set. Tanya Roberts, on the other hand, is such a bimbo that she fails complete as a Bond girl. You're just hoping that she gets naked soon, which unfortunately never happens because the film is PG. The villain Zorin (Christopher Walken) is OK. But what really destroys this film, apart from a totally inadequate Bond, is the plot which has to be the most simplistic, unoriginal piece of rubbish ever to be put into a Bond film.",A View to a Kill

150,BumpyRide,More Fluff Than My Dryer Basket,1,19 August 2005,"Typical overblown fluff as Roger Moore tries to grind this franchise into the ground once and for all. This movie is so bad, and so boring I can't even think of ten lines of comments for IMDb to post, but I'll try! Grace Jones is somewhat amusing, she just jumps off the Effel Tower and sneers a lot. Tonya Roberts is so coked up I wonder is she even knew where she was? She's the worst Bond girl (if you can call her a girl) ever. Bond girls in the past could walk and talk at the same time. The least said about Roger Moore's, James Bond the better. I saw this is the theater when it first came out, and the film projector kept on breaking down. The gods were telling me something. When one watches this movie and you think back to when Bond wasn't a cartoon character you realize how far off track the producers and us have come.",A View to a Kill

Ring any bells? If so, you've seen this one, and it's no wonder it's taking you a moment to recollect it as this is one of the more feeble efforts in the Bond series as a whole. Walken is great as the villain, but that's about the only thing to recommend this decidedly average addition to the series The lead lady, Tanya Roberts, is so limp you could put her in a salad and nobody would notice the difference, and the less said about Grace Jones the better.

152,David_Frames,"The Pop, Cop and Fopp show.",7,10 March 2005,"Held in greater esteem than it deserves by nostalgic fans of a certain age, View...is fairly routine as the series goes but said formula looks and sounds a little better than usual perhaps because the guest cast lend the whole thing a little kudos and...well, it's Duran Duran for God's sake! The story is Bond by the numbers: Moore investigates an evil industrialist bred by a Nazi geneticist whose blonde hair and blue eyes are firmly focused on California's Silicon Valley with a view to, er, well you know... Along the way Zorin (Christopher Walken phoning it in) makes the odd half-hearted attempt at bumping off the ageing super-spy, fails and ends up failing victim to the sharp edge of Moore's one liners...and gravity. Billed as Bond meeting his match, for once you can go with it principally because Walken and side-kick ""May-Day"" (Grace Jones) are superb value as psychotic and ball-breaker respectively, effectively cancelling out Tanya Robert's excruciating Bond girl who manages to set the woman's movement back 30 years with blonde haired, scream queen efficiency. A good score by John Barry helps as does some fairly solid set-pieces (Moore's Horse Escape, the City Hall fire etc...) but its no classic, primarily because the pace flags at times, Moore is looking a shade creaky and the tone occasionally strays into ill-advised panto - not least in the beach boys opening for which someone should be brutally punished. Good fun never the less and a fair curtain dropper to Moore's era in the tux.",A View to a Kill
153,vox-sane,Not as Bad as it Looks,6,14 December 1999,"Roger Moore's last stand as James Bond, before Timothy Dalton breathed new life into the seemingly exhausted series, isn't as bad as it looks. Repeated viewings, if you can stand them, do reveal overlooked gems. Christopher Walken's underwhelming performance nevertheless becomes Bond's most demented foe, and is dangerous more because of his unpredictability than his power.  The flaming elevator scene also becomes one of Bond's most exciting set-pieces.  The climax, however, isn't as spectacular as it was meant to be.  Good points:  John Steed (following two of his ""Avengers"" co-stars) finally makes his own appearance in a Bond film.  Pre-Indiana Jones Alison Doody isn't given enough to do, and Tanya Roberts has perhaps too much to do.  The movie is a must-see for Bond fans who haven't caught it yet, but is probably incomprehensible and less than entertaining for those who don't appreciate the James Bond franchise.  After this movie, although ""The Living Daylights"" was allegedly written for him, it was clearly time for Moore to bow gracefully out of the role he took under inauspicious circumstances, and made his own through sheer persistence.",A View to a Kill

It was so hard to watch Roger Moore try to make something of this role.",A View to a Kill
155,carologletree,A Fine Sendoff For Roger Moore,7,8 January 2016,"This is considered by many people to be one of the worst, if not the worst Bond films, but I disagree. This was another entertaining entry in the Bond series with enough stuff to keep you interested. Sir Roger Moore considers this the worst of the Bond films he has done, but I feel that that title belongs to ""The Man With The Golden Gun.""Of course, this film is known for having a 57-year-old Roger Moore in the role. Yes, he did look a lot older, and it was time for him to step aside, but I'll at least give him credit for still managing to do the action scenes.Christopher Walken, one of my favorite actors ever, brings all the right over-the-top qualities to the mega-maniacal Max Zorin, who wants to destroy Silicon Valley and gain a monopoly of microchips. May Day, played by Grace Jones, however, is really creepy. The less said about her, the better.As is usual with Bond films, this film delivers plenty of action. The fight in the Eiffel Tower, the chase through the streets of San Francisco, and especially the climax on the Golden Gate Bridge are fun to watch.The theme song by Duran Duran is one of my favorites. It still to this day remains the only Bond song to top the Billboard charts. However, Tanya Roberts' Stacey Sutton character is pretty whiny and annoying and ultimately forgettable.This was a decent film and a fine closing to Roger Moore's run as James Bond. It's far from perfect, and it's far from the best of the series, but it's also not the worst.RATING: B-",A View to a Kill
156,Ibuk,No Moore please!!,4,14 July 2008,"AVTAK I consider to be the worst Roger Moore Bond movie. I feel that you can always tell a good Bond movie from its opening sequence, TSWLM had the fabulous ski chase resulting in a marvellous scene where we think Bond is going to die and was a great Bond movie. AVTAK has a pretty bad opening sequence with Moore trying to retrieve a necklace. Almost every Bond movie has a standout scene that instantly comes to kind when I think of the movie AVTAK has none. Then we have Roger Moore who was approaching his 60's looked much too old and therefore unconvincing as Bond. It's not just Moore who was looking worn out, the movie itself looked very tired compared to the other Bond flicks of the 80's. AVTAK basically consists of one uninteresting scene after another. God bless those producers who realised their mistake and replaced Moore with Timothy Dalton in The Living Daylight which was a much better Bond movie. The action sequences looked rather uninspired which is another major flaw. Max Zorin's scheme to raid Silicon Valley seems rather feeble compared to other Bond meglomaniacs like Stromberg, Blofeld etc. I read a review on Youtube which said AVTAK plot resembles that of Goldfinger's and now that I have thought about it I think AVTAK is kind of modelled on Goldfinger. Goldfinger planned to raid Fort Knox whilst in AVTAK it's Silicon Valley. Zorin had a female accomplice in the form of Mayday who suddenly turns good towards the end, Goldfinger had Pussy Galore. To its credit it has a pretty good theme tune and also has Christopher Walken's performance as Max Zorin(woefully underrated in my opinion). If only Roger Moore had realised he was far too old for Bond then us Bond fans wouldn't have had to endure this ludricous misfire.",A View to a Kill
157,LuboLarsson,Just one Moore,7,7 July 2002,"Roger Moore made some great Bond films. A View to a Kill is a good Bond film that suffers from one thing, Moore was to old to be playing James Bond by 1985, because Bond has to look like he can handle himself in a fight and perform all manner of stunts plus look like a woman as young as Tanya Roberts would be attracted to him, Moore couldn't pull off either of those things. Everything else he done fine, but the moment 007 has to spring into action its glaringly obvious to everyone its Rogers double doing the athletic bits, why wasn't obvious to the makers and Roger himself?. Octopussy would have been the perfect send off for Moore. Its still sad to see him go though as he was in my opinion a great James Bond with the Spy who Loved Me his best film, 8 years previous to this. This is still a Bond film though and there some great action sequences, especially the chase through Paris. Walken is fine as the villain but I expected more from him. I think Grace Jones was great and Tanya Roberts was gorgeous but wasn't given much to do but scream and yell James every five minutes, another good score from John Barry (please use him again Bond producers) and a cracking theme tune from those Duran Duran lads. Thanks for keeping the James Bond series going Roger, now over to you Timothy.",A View to a Kill
158,georgewilliamnoble,So Much Better After 35 Years!,8,22 October 2021,"I remember when I saw this at my local cinema when it first came out and I was left distinctly disappointed and in general I have always regarded this movie as second only to ""die another day"" as the worst of the long running franchise. The flippant comic nature of the Roger Moore bond outings never really played well to me, I always preferred the edgier Sean Connery treatment. None the less watching the Roger Moore films now I find they have aged surprisingly well. The stunts, the music, and the title sequences are a joy in themselves and "" a view to a kill"" delivers super entertainment of the escapism kind with Roger Moore's one eyelid acting style a scream just perfect for the witty if sexist comic lines. While I was left in stitches at the heroines dialogue of James, James James, Oh James and Ahh James, all hilarious. Christopher Walken has a ball hamming it up as the super villain while Grace Jones adds a memorial new character to the series with some style. In short I found the movie a delightful guilty pleasure and as always the brilliant John Barry score is a pure delight.",A View to a Kill

160,cosmorados,"The great bond theme makes this a two, otherwise we'd be looking at a one!",2,6 July 2008,"Bond is sent to recover a microchip from a deceased double O agent who died in a frozen wasteland. After a dismal pre-credits action piece that has Roger Moore sloppily edited into the stuntman's work, we discover that the microchip is designed to withstand a nuclear blast. The chip comes from Zorin Industries and Bond is sent to investigate the Industrialist called Max Zorin, a race horse enthusiast who is also the head of the electronics/computer company. Max Zorin is actually the victim of a Nazi/communist testing that has resulted in him turning psychotic. His new grand psychotic plan is to cause an earth quake that will consume silicon valley and turn Zorin enterprises into the market leader (Didn't we see something like this in ""Superman: The Motion Picture""?) This is the worst of all the Bond films with Roger Moore seeming to perform the entire film on back projection in his Swiss chalet. The fight scenes are terrible and one in particular at Zorin's stables has Roger Moore hit someone and they then lie down on a conveyor belt, no, not get knocked onto the conveyor belt, they lie down! Every action sequence is an anticlimax as Bond seems positively easy to beat as Rodge can barely move without having a blue screen behind him, with the fight in Stacey's house being particularly embarrassing. As you may have gathered from the above comment the direction in this film is extremely poor as they were clearly attempting a number of tricks to make Roger Moore look like he could still hold his own in a fight scene which, sadly, he couldn't. The amazing thing about all of this is that the beginning 5 minute sequence to ""The Living Daylights"" is better and more exciting than this entire film! The script is a mish-mash of previous Bond films with a key ingredient from Superman added, the cast is terrible with Roger on autopilot and Grace Jones being simply awful, this film reeks of cash-in. The only partial saving grace in this film is the score by John Barry which is still good and the excellent thumping theme song from Duran Duran which almost makes it bearable, but not quite. Even the usually reliable Christopher Walken is dreadful in this film as it's hard to play someone who has no personality.Mediocre dross of the lowest order.",A View to a Kill
161,C22Man,Moore goes out on a low,3,17 July 2015,"Title: Fits in with Bond and certainly sounds cool.Pre-Titles: Bond locates a Soviet microchip from a dead agent in Siberia and manages to avoid some pursuers by skiing to safety. This is another excellent opening sequence with some fantastic stunt work and it also manages to balance out a sense of enjoyment with some intensity. The only issue is that 'California Girls' by the Beach Boys is randomly thrown in and it doesn't fit at all. Theme Song: Pop band Duran Duran provide one of the series catchiest themes. It might sound a little too dance driven to be in Bond, but it has memorable lyrics that combine with a great rhythm and a lot of energy that make it standout.Plot: The microchip Bond recovered is identical to a British prototype and Bond is sent to investigate the company behind it. He finds out that industrialist Max Zorin is planning on destroying Silicon Valley via earthquake so he can exploit the microchip market. The story is very weak. It just isn't set up well which makes it not remotely interesting and Zorin's plan does make much sense even for a Bond villain. The film is trying to look at a more unique way of world domination in fairness, but for not one moment is any of it believable or engaging which is the issue.James Bond: Roger Moore definitely looks too old by this point, I mean he could be playing Bond's dad here. He's still likable and amusingly witty, but he'd clearly aged since Octopussy and he is no longer believable in the role. It's so obviously not him in the action, he looks out of place doing spy work and most of the seductive scenes are really awkward which just isn't Bond.Bond Girls: Tanya Roberts is absolutely awful as Stacey. The character is basically an idiot which doesn't help, but Roberts delivers her lines with so little emotion and her shrieks of ''James!'' are ear scraping. Plus she has no chemistry whatsoever with Moore. Sure she's good-looking, but the role has no depth and Roberts is painfully wooden.Villains: Christopher Walken should have been a great villain, but he is wasted horribly. Zorin is just such a dull villain. He has no lines that are even slightly memorable, his only trait is that he's a bit of a psychopath and Walken looks bored out of his mind throughout. Grace Jones is okay as May Day. She is at least impressive due to her unique look, but all she does is stand around looking mean and her switch to Bond's ally feels forced. Not to mention the scene where Bond seducers her is cringe-worthy. Support: Patrick Macnee, known for The Avengers, is enjoyable as Bond's ally Sir Godfrey. Macnee has a warm screen presence and he has a real chemistry with Moore that is used effectively. Robert Brown is solid once again as M.Action: The action is decent, but on the whole it's very forgettable. We get some cool action in the Eiffel Tower which is a unique location and then the usual Moore car chase which is silly fun. Another chase in a fire truck round San Francisco is again unique, but it's played for laughs a bit too much. We get some decent fist fights and assassinations littered throughout, but nothing special. The climax is dreadful. The set-up on top of the Golden Gate Bridge is again interesting, but Zorin is overpowered with ease and Bond's moves like an acrobat which takes away any tension.Score: John Barry's score is excellent and probably the best thing here. He adds even more energy and tension here, which results in some really excellent compositions. It is used well to give scenes some added punch, but it deserves to be in a better film.Production Values: John Glen keeps his low-key style, but with no good storyline or character development everything is just looks flat or dreary. The writing is really weak. It's like the film doesn't know whether it wants to be more serious or more comical which results in a very unbalanced film. Zorin is treated seriously but is extremely boring, whilst outlandish events continue to happen and they are excruciatingly bad. The pacing isn't great here either, with the story taking forever to get going as we see Bond messing around at Zorin's stables for an age. The stunt work is very good, but it is so clearly not Moore and they don't even try to hide it which ruins most of the action scenes. The locations are good as usual, with San Francisco making a great backdrop to the events taking place.Conclusion: Roger Moore's last outing as Bond is easily one of the series weakest. For a start the plot is terrible and the more you think about it the less logical it becomes. Moore looks ancient and as a result most of the charm he had has dried up. Tanya Roberts makes an awful Bond girl and the waste of someone as enjoyable as Christopher Walken is unforgivable too. Apart from Barry's score and the locations there is nothing above average here. Everything feels like it was done lazily, there is no energy or interest in the film and that makes it such a poor effort. It was so clear that Bond needed a fresh injection and it's a shame Moore bowed out on a low.",A View to a Kill
162,movieman-200,"Campy Bond, a fitting end to Moore's tenure as 007",7,12 June 2005,"Much maligned upon its theatrical release, A View To A Kill (1985) effectively rounded out Roger Moore's tenure as James Bond in a flurry of classic clichés and stunning action sequences. What is perhaps most regrettable about the film is its attempt to not so finely balance camp elements (as with Bond knocking the hats of a couple of cowboys while clinging to the undercarriage of a fire truck ladder) with the more serious brevity of saving the world yet again. John Glen directs once more with his usual flair for the spectacular; and to be sure, during two of the film's action sequences (both the Eiffel Tower jumper stunt and the climactic Golden Gate Bridge battle of wills) he masterfully succeeds. And although not nearly as bad as critics ripped it apart to be in 1985, A View To A Kill does not live up to the very best of the Bond franchise.Bond is assigned to investigate the practices of Max Zorin (Christopher Walken), a leading industrialist who is using steroids to win horse races. Zorin's accomplices are a former practicing Nazi, Dr. Carl Mortner (Willoughby Gray) and, a devious woman of means and menace, MayDay (Grace Jones). What Bond discovers is that fixing races is only the tip of the iceberg. Zorin plans to flood Silicon Valley by generating a cataclysmic earthquake with the detonation of a nuclear device, thereby ensuring his own supremacy in the market share of microchip production. After finagling his way to a weekend retreat as an English lord interested in stud farming, Bond meets up with Stacey Sutton (Tanya Roberts), a geologist who has been paid off by Zorin. Robert's performance degenerates into shrill shrieking for help and rescue at every possible turn, and clueless moments of introspection that make her one of the most hapless of all Bond girls. In point of fact, she reminds me of Chrissy from ""Three's Company."" As Zorin, Christopher Walken is a fairly strong villain. Perhaps then the best that can be said of A View To A Kill, is that, like Moonraker, it is a film that begs you not to take its plot or characters too seriously. On that score, then, A View To A Kill is one heck of a good thrill ride.The MGM/UA anamorphic widescreen DVD is fairly impressive. Though age related artifacts are present throughout the transfer, colors are fairly accurately balanced. Occasionally flesh tones can seem slightly more pink than one would like. Blacks are generally solid. Fine details are realized through most daytime sequences, but less so after dark. There are NO digital anomalies for an image that is generally smooth and easy on the eyes. The audio is 5.1 and, although dated, nevertheless packs a wallop. Extras include two very comprehensive documentaries, an audio commentary, some promotional junket materials and the film's original theatrical trailer.",A View to a Kill

The series has provided us with many memorable villains, whether it's SPECTRE, Afro American drug-dealers or superhumans with jaws of steel - but Walken stands out because of how evil his character is depicted, never shying away from brutally murdering those around him, even his supposed allies. Walken is always great, in movies such as The Deer Hunter and Catch me if you can, and this is no exception.As always, it includes some breathtaking action scenes and effects, and an overall feeling of adventure and fun, which makes it worthwhile. And, of course, the Golden Globe nominated opening song by Duran Duran is one to be mentioned, standing out as one of the best in the series.Overall, this may not be one of the best entries in the franchise; but it has some great things going for, particulary the main villain.",A View to a Kill

Beginning with Duran Duran's awesome title song (my all time favorite song), thru all the beautiful locales (Paris, Chantilly, SAN FRANCISCO) to the finale battle on the Golden Gate Bridge the level of entertainment remains high.  By this point the Bond formula has been perfected so that even with some minor flaws, the end product is guaranteed to be entertaining.

Roger Moore looks old but not too ancient to be pulling off his 7th turn as 007 (and his last.) He actually looked older in Octopussy two years previous. The plot of View is weak but the action is good. Tanya Roberts as the Bond Girl is a bad casting choice but Christopher Walken does a great crazy villain. Duran Duran's opening song is the only one in 15 Bond films that I turn ALL THE WAY UP when it comes on. The musical score by John Barry, including the Bond Theme, are top notch.

168,rjsf96,Moore's Last Bond Entry Never Received the Credit It Deserves,7,29 October 2015,"A View to a Kill is whisper it underrated; criminally underrated. That's not to say that I cannot understand why someone would dislike it. I just fail to comprehend why A View to a Kill receives such furious hate on a regular basis even after thirty years since its theatrical release.Max Zorin is a leading French Industrialist who makes an astonishing level of profit from horse racing. 007 is tasked with foiling Zorin's mad scheme; to destroy Silicon Valley, so that he can have a monopoly on the world's microchip market.The first point of criticism that most people offer up is Roger Moore's age. Fifty seven. Yes he is too old to play the part. It is incredibly obvious in the wide shots that Moore is using an altogether unconvincing stunt double. But unbelievably it is a fun Bond film that never takes itself too seriously and will always have a laugh at its own expense.Tanya Roberts as Stacy Sutton is not the worst Bond girl to grace the franchise. Let us not forget the girls of Diamonds Are Forever and The Man with the Golden Gun. Roberts does resort to screaming though in several scenes and you wish that Bond would just shut her up.Still many of the classic elements of the Bond franchise are still in play and used exceedingly well. Duran Duran's song is the catchiest and most outright enjoyable of the series. John Barry is on top form here, A View to a Kill is without a doubt his best work. The action pleases on regular occasions particularly a leap from the Eiffel Tower and the climactic battle atop the Golden Gate Bridge. The gags in A View to a Kill visual and audial make the film's intentions simple and clear. This Bond film just wants us to have a fun and light hearted time, it succeeds on both accounts.Max Zorin played with glee by Christopher Walken is still my favourite villain to date. Twisted, psychotic and above all deranged, the screen blows up whenever Walken walks in center stage. Walken and Grace Jones make a formidable pair on screen and a worthy match for Bond.A View to a Kill is not meant to be taken seriously. Not even for a fleeting second, it relies completely on suspension of disbelief.

I don't think it takes itself too seriously and the set pieces are quite exciting.One great inclusion in this movie is that of Grace Jones, the androgenous pop star who plays Mayday - Zorin's lead hench-woman. She (in my opinion) is up there in terms of Bond henchman (including the legendary likes of Jaws and Oddjob!). She just adds to the over-the-top experience that is 007.Probably the downers for this movie is that it is perhaps too long (in the tradition of most Bond films) and that both Roger Moore and the woman that plays Miss Moneypenny are way too old for their roles. I find it odd that any women find Bond arousing in this film - it is like going to bed with your Grandfather (by my calculations - Moore would have been almost 60 when he made this film).I definitely feel that this movie for me is a guilty pleasure - so it is bad - but in a good way.",A View to a Kill

Naturally Bond walks out unscathed to the amazement of the crowd. There is a fire truck chase in San Francisco that plays more like a Three Stooges one reeler, and Bond-calling himself MR. Stock {Get It} simply does not cut it. The wrecked Zorin blimp on the Golden Gate bridge looks like a deflated balloon, which is exactly what it was. Only highlight is Miss Moneypenny in a pink outfit who is going to some sort of horse race with the British intelligence crew.Sitting through this movie is a chore. At least ""Moonraker"" had a kinetic energy that this effort sadly lacks. Moore-as Bond went out with a wimper in this one. For die-hard Bond junkies only!",A View to a Kill
172,rawiri42,The Indestructible Bond (again!),6,1 November 2014,"Roger Moore in his final stint as James (shaken not stirred) Bond is a smooth as ever (he doesn't actually ask for that in this film). Is there anything the man can't do? he out-rides the bad guy (a very young Christopher Walken) on a doped-up racehorse and drives an articulated fire truck like a stunt man amongst several other death- defying adventures.After 13 Bond movies, I guess we get to know what's coming next and the only real novelty of this effort is the ""Boys From Brazil""-type character played by Walken who is a sort of super-evil cloned version of his father who has defected from the KGB (Yes, no Spectre in this movie either!) and wants to take over the world market for his computer super-chip. The only problem for that plan is Silicon Valley in California and so Walken sets a plan to completely destroy the whole of Silicon Valley in one fell swoop by triggering a massive earthquake in the San Andreas fault that the world will think was an unfortunate natural disaster. His only real problem is Bond (I'll bet you guessed that though!)All in all, it is, as I say, number 14 in the series and features the same stuff that's in all the others - except that it's a different colour (so to speak). The usual ho-hum romp between extremely bad shots who can't hit Bond at point-blank range, the occasional bomb failing to destroy him ...blah, blah, blah and, of course, some mild sex scenes jammed in between all the action.I think I've been too generous giving it a 6!",A View to a Kill
173,glenn-aylett,Saved by Grace Jones and Bond has an unusual skill in this,8,18 June 2011,"I think anyone who flicks on ITV1 in England on a Saturday afternoon will see this about three times a year. Basically the plot is about a psychotic billionaire named Max Zorin who wants to destroy Silicon Valley in California so his corporation gains a monopoly in the computer and IT industry.However, while a decent film to round off Moore's 12 years as Bond and vastly better than Connery's sign off with the ghastly Diamonds Are Forever, what really stands out for me is Grace Jones as Mayday. Beautiful in an unconventional way and with a conditioned physique, Grace Jones really takes to the role as Zorin's lover, assassin and bodyguard. This is one lady you wouldn't mess with as she is an expert at karate and judo and an expert with all kinds of weapons. Also she redeems herself at the end by siding with Bond when she realises Zorin has tricked her and has left her to die. Now if only Grace Jones had the role as the Bond girl- maybe as a good version of Mayday- this film would get ten stars as I found Tanya Roberts dull as the Bond girl in this.Also Bond develops an unusual skill not normally associated with 007, he is an expert cook, making a quiche Gordon Ramsay would be proud of. This again is typical of Moore's portrayal of Bond, being a bit more human than Connery, and as ever the corny quips keep coming throughout the film.If you decide to watch A View To A Kill, it is quite a good film with its budget well spent and is a good way to pass two hours. However, it isn't up there with the likes of Goldfinger and Moore is starting to look old by 1985.",A View to a Kill
174,alexx668,View to a kill..,6,6 December 2008,"""A View To A Kill"" usually gets a lot of flak, but criticizing a larger-than-life action flick (as James Bond usually is) is like criticizing a hamburger, or any other mass product. It's no Mona Lisa and it's not meant to be. And to be honest, even the Mona Lisa is not the masterpiece it's made to be. -)OK, so there are serious considerations about the film. And it's not so much that Roger Moore looks old, but rather that he *acts* old. Gone is the exuberance and youthful spirit of previous Moore Bonds. Moore seems tired and unenthusiastic, as if going through the motions, as if he doesn't care anymore. He doesn't convince.Pace-wise, there's a serious flat spot early on and it lasts for a long time. It simply is boring from the moment Bond enters the Zorin residence trying to find out about any wrongdoings and about until Tanya Roberts enters the frame. It's not helped by the plot either: ex KGB agent/ specimen turned microchip businessman trying to take over the market by blowing up Silicon Valley. It could be better, much better.What literally saves the film is the two stunning action sequences in the second half. First we got Moore and Roberts' narrow escape, leading to one of the best Bond car-chases ever. In a fire-truck of all vehicles! With Moore hanging from the extending ladder!! And then the spectacular Golden Gate Bridge sequence, brilliantly directed - is it a first for John Glen?So, among the best Bonds this is not, but a nice farewell from Mr. Moore all the same.",A View to a Kill
175,mmuggi,The last outing for Sir Roger Moore,6,25 January 2021,"A view to a kill is the last film with Sir Roger Moore as James Bond. It was an entertaining film, with two great antagonists in the form of Christopher Walken as Max Zorin and Grace Jones as May Day. Most of the film dies, and it must be said that it is the Soviet Union that ends up at the top of the film here.Roger Morre was 58 years old at the time, and it was partly clear to see that he was getting too old to play Bond. Still, I think he's doing a really sensible job.The intro is a more popped / disco intro. This intro also works pretty well as instrumental during the film. However, the sound side is still very loud and the plot is far out and relatively incoherent.Unlike many others, I actually think Sir Roger Moore was an honorable Bond.",A View to a Kill
176,GTeixeira,Roger Moore deserved to leave on a higher note,4,19 February 2014,"James Bond is sent to investigate Max Zorin, a leading businessman in the microchip market, who unknowingly to him not only has a shady past with the KGB and the Nazis but also intends to destroy the Silicon Valley.The last of Roger Moore's 007 films, and frankly his worst. This might be the very first Bond film I didn't really like before the Brosnan-era.The plot is far too outlandish and all over the place. While this is very common within the franchise ('A View to a Kill' looks like a documentary in comparison to, say, 'Moonraker'), this particular entry lacks the fantasy-esque quality the series always employed. It tries to be slightly 'gritty' yet keeps the silliness of an action-fantasy (for example, the car chase); this ends up only making it lose the flash and style that makes 007's films so fun to watch.Roger Moore looks far too old, and his Bond feels tired; not only are his stunts even less believable to the point of ridiculousness, but he lacks the wit and charm he was known for. But not all fault falls on him: the girls are terrible in this one, with Grace Jones being an eyesore while Tanya Roberts is lacking in charm or acting competence.The movie has its moments, true. The opening ski scene, the later dirigible confront, and above all one of the best Bond villains in the form of Christopher Walken's Max Zorin (even in his better outings Moore would be hard-pressed to match him). But that is pretty much it.'A View to a Kill' is one of the weakest entries in the Bond franchise, and easily Moore's weakest. Still, when taking in consideration his history, it is only a minor bump. This might not be good, but it won't destroy any fond memories either.",A View to a Kill
177,eamon-hennedy,"I know I shouldn't, but I love it.",8,10 March 2004,"Roger Moore is too old, Tanya Roberts is too young for him, and Christopher Walken and Grace Jones make an odd pairing, but if this films is one thing it is very enjoyable. While these factors should make the film a disaster, it is, however, great fun, with Moore joyfully playful as usual, Roberts alright as a screaming heroine and Walken and Jones are great as the villains, Max Zorin and May Day. While it may seem like an odd pairing (Oscar winning actor, violent acting singer who attacks chat show hosts), they are superbly psychotic together (until May Day turns into a good guy at the end). There is a feeling here that it's all been done before, and possibly better. Megalo-maniacal villain, here trying to destroy Silicon Valley, the heroine who is clever but needs Bond to save her, the puns and double meanings as well as the fast paced action sequences, but it strangely works for me. As a Bond film it isn't a classic, and it sure as hell it ain't one of Moore's best. It will never compare to Goldfinger, From Russia With Love, Licence to Kill, The World is not Enough, The Spy Who Loved Me or The Man with the Golden Gun, what it will do is provide the audience with two hours of solid fun. If there's is anything overtly wrong with the film it's the use of the Beach Boys when Bond is snow boarding (John Glen should hang his head in shame for that one). However when you have Moore, despite looking too old for the part here, being playful as usual, a great villain in the shape of Walken who is typically in psychotic mode here, a great theme tune from Duran Duran and a wonderful score from John Barry why should we complain. Bond films are meant to be about entertainment, anybody watching these films for dialog or plot needs their head examined. While it is fun to get Bond films that put the plot and characters center staged like Licence to Kill, For Your Eyes Only and The World is Not Enough, it is also great when we get fun pieces of entertainment like this. The film is eye and ear candy. Barry's music is so much fun it clearly goes well with the film and while Tanya Roberts sure as hell ain't a great actress, she is pleasant on the eye. All in all it is great fun and while I know there are many out there that really hate this film I don't. I love it, so there.",A View to a Kill

179,cordaro9418,One Film too late...,6,10 September 2008,"Unfortunately, Roger Moore ended his Bond career, one film too late. Octopussy would have been an incredible farewell performance, as it is easily regarded as one of his best roles... but instead, he came back one more time.Not that his acting the role was too stale, or that his supporting cast (except Christopher Walken) seemed to just be walking through, I just don't think Moore thought he should be there. Many a time he said he felt he was 'too long in the tooth' to be romancing these much younger characters... and it showed.This film was my first theatrical Bond film. I'd seen the ABC's Sunday night films, such as 'From Russia..', 'Octopussy' and even 'Never Say Never Again', but this was the first in theater experience. For a 9 year old kid, it was awesome. As I got older and more into Bond and his adventures, it was sad, to know I was introduced to Moore's lesser performance.",A View to a Kill

Like a lot of Moore's other Bond films this fails to impress and just ends up looking stupid. Not quite as bad as Moonraker, but still bad. Its boring, unbelievable, stupidly tongue-in-cheek and annoying. Tanya Roberts is very annoying and Grace Jones is just weird. This is the reason why Moore was the worst Bond, though to be fair to him its not his fault this film is bad. Christopher Walken is probably the only good thing about it, though he deserves a lot better than this.

The mere introduction alone with the women in florescent Zink sunblock dancing in ultraviolet light is enough to justify the price of admission. It must be seen to be believed...not to mention the Duran Duran theme song, ""A View to a Kill"", which epitomizes the era. An admitted childhood pleasure.As a film, basically it fails. However, given the insanely over the top puns and situations, this film is unintentionally filled with laughs that make it one of the best inadvertent comedies of all time. It's completely ridiculous, but it's fun. Not to mention the fact that rapists can be cured simply by watching this film and witnessing a snarling Grace Jones in a thong. Not one of Bond's best bags.

182,freewillyfan,A View to a Kill,4,1 November 2019,"A View to a Kill is the seventh and final Roger Moore James Bond film. In my opinion this was his worst and one of the worst in the franchise. To start, Roger Moore is too old in this film and his stunt double is very noticeable in this. The villain is ok and the henchwoman is pretty good I thought. This movie overall is very forgettable. Nothing about I found stood out. Some of the action scenes are fun to watch if you're ok with the campyness. Overall a forgettable film with not much going for it.4.2/10",A View to a Kill
183,ogdendc,Weakest Bond,5,11 August 2015,"A View to a Kill is the most questionable Bond so far in the series. For example, Why persevere with Roger Moore at the age of 57 when the main love interest is 29? Why cast Tanya Roberts anyway when she was fresh from a Razzie nomination for Sheena, Queen of the Jungle? She repaid the producers by getting one for this film too! Why set the opening scene in the gorgeous setting of Iceland, then use the Beach Boys' California girls as the music? Talking of music, who authorised Duran Duran to sing the title track? This dirge has dated worse than any other Bond theme song. Am I right in thinking that the only high-tech gadget here is a pair of Polarizing sunglasses? Is the first love interest before the title sequence played by Alison Doody? She was 19 at the time. Moore could have been her grandad. Of all the women Bond beds in this film, Ivanova (Fiona Fullerton) seems the most convincing.I'm not against using older actors appropriately. For instance, Patrick Macnee works well with Moore as Sir Godfrey Tibbett. Makes you wonder why he wasn't considered earlier.Grace Jones (May Day) is just bizarre in every scene, though her jump from the Eiffel Tower is spectacular, as is Bond's driving, or rather the stunt-double-who-looks-nothing-like-Bond's driving.Christopher Walkden is oddly restrained, and who told Alison Doody and Patrick Bauchau to deliver their lines in a nasal monotone? Tanya Roberts speaks as if she is unfamiliar with the meaning of any word of more than two syllables, and we're supposed to believe she is the State Geologist, which is totally ridiculous.All in all, this is a mess.",A View to a Kill
184,TimBoHannon,A Three-Quarters Decent Swansong for the Aging Roger Moore,5,19 June 2007,"Roger Moore turned 57 during the making of this film and it would be the end of his tenure as Agent 007. While not as successful or belovedas Sean Connery, with his seven films he left his own distinctive stamp on the role. The thirteen years of Roger Moore were less violent and more lighthearted than Connery's. A generation of Bond fans grew up with Roger Moore as their James Bond, and his fourth film, ""Moonraker,"" tallied the highest gross until ""GoldenEye"" in 1995. His likeness appears alongside Connery and Pierce Brosnan in the imagination of every true fan.In light of Moore's age and the declining quality of the films preceding, it is no surprise that this one of the two most unpopular Bond movies (Moonraker is the other). It is nonetheless an improvement over ""Octopussy,"" it's predecessor There are some refreshing changes that set it apart from most of the Moore efforts.The opener takes place in the mountains of Siberia, with Bond the expert skier running from Russian patrols after finding 003's body. It contains the best snow action since the authoritative mountain chases in ""On Her Majesty's Secret Service,"" although it lacks the awe factor of ""The Spy Who Loved Me's"" ski jump. Director John Glenn makes an odd decision by interrupting John Barry's superb action theme with the Beach Boys ""California Girls."" The song isunnecessary since Speaking of Barry his trombone heavy music during the movie's four big action parts is particularly good and the overall score is one of his best.The inimitable Christopher Walken plays Max Zorin, a phenomenally intelligent psychotic thanks to steroid testing on his mother. He plans to monopolize the microchip economy by wiping Silicon Valley from the face of the Earth. The movie dawdles in reaching that point. His lecture on the operation, called Project Main Strike, does not come until 55 minutes have been used up on an investigation of Zorin's cheating in horse races. Although it has little relevance to the story, it is not entirely a waste of time as Moore spends several delightful moments with ""Avengers"" actor Patrick Macnee, and includes a memorable moment where Bond outsmarts Zorin by breathing air from a tire. In the climax, he hangs onto mooring rope of Zorin's blimp as they fly over San Francisco. It feels rushed, as if the movie knows it is nearly out of time and needs to finish itself soon. Zorin's death is among the most iconic in movies, but on the whole it left me wanting more.While Roger Moore has the role of James down to a science by now, his age finally catches up with him. His hair is receding, his eyes lookolder and his face is more wrinkled, but his heart is still there. Nevertheless, he does not look as old as Sean Connery did in the embarrassing ""Diamonds Are Forever."" Grace Jones is effective as Zorin's sidekick May Day, but is all fluff. She does many feats of strength, but never has the grand confrontation the character deserves.Former Charlie's Angel Tanya Roberts plays geologist Stacey Sutton. Sutton is possibly the dumbest Bond girl of them all. Roberts cannot act if her freedom depended on it, although she sure can scream. Her main function is to plead ""Oh, James!"" over and over. A new height is achieved on the clueless scale when Sutton fails to recognize Zorin's blimp sneaking up on her.The highest praise is reserved for Walken. Walken is probably more popular today than he was then, and his Oscar-winning pedigree is not absent. His effort lifts Zorin beyond the page, and makes him the best villain of the Moore era. His cleverest moment is when Zorin walks into a man's office and explains his next moves in the past tense, then shoots the tenant. Zorin is his most chilling when he and a cohort useseveral uzi magazines to ruthlessly murder their own men, and he laughs during the butchery.The innuendo level is raised a few notches, but aside from that there are no problems big enough to sink ""A View to a Kill."" The closest is when Bond and Sutton use a fire truck to escape police warden who exhibits all the intelligence of the absent J.W. Pepper.Although the negatives do not destroy the movie, it is not great without them. Although ""A View to a Kill"" does not earn a recommendation, Christopher Walken does, and it may be worth seeing for the few positives it has.Note: This is also the last appearance of Lois Maxwell as Moneypenny.",A View to a Kill
185,Magenta_Bob,Very forgettable Bond film,4,27 March 2010,"A View to a Kill is not downright bad, but there is virtually nothing memorable about it. It's the kind of Bond film that the franchise can make in its sleep. They might not exactly be known for their interesting plots, but this one is almost particularly forgettable and I'd be hard pressed to explain it to you, although it contains race horses, computer chips and a vicious plan to destroy Silicon Valley. Everyone in the film seems rather uninspired, and who can blame them? Even Christopher Walken, who is usually a great actor, is surprisingly pale and I wonder why he wanted to be in this film. Roger Moore is all right as James Bond; he is no worse and certainly no better than usual, although he doesn't have a lot of good material to work with. Still, when given the chance, he sure knows how to deliver a witty one-liner.Like I said, it's not all that bad; it still offers two hours of fairly good entertainment, there are some cool car chases and the locations (Paris, San Francisco) are fine. The only thing is that there are plenty of Bond films that can give you this, and so much more.",A View to a Kill

Truth be told, I think Moonraker should have been his finale.This movie is basically a poor man's ""Goldfinger"" but with none of the charm of the original.Like the majority of the Moore Bond movies, the action scenes are fine but everything else in between is pointless filler. The opening sequence could have been one of the best but for some reason they decide to interrupt the dramatic music, throw in ""California girls"" to kill the tension then bring back the dramatic music. Pointless!Moore is out of his element by now and stumbles along unconvincingly, Tanya Roberts is poorly used (from one of Charlie's Angels to a damsel in distress). Christopher Walken is usually terrific as a villain, but he couldn't save this.Also, what was the point of the kgb operative making the recording, then James stealing it from her?

187,Robinson2511,A View to an Overkill,3,27 December 2015,"Oh Boy, while I love Bond films, A View to a Kill is undoubtedly my least favourite, there's really nothing here to make me like this film. Interesting Characters: No. Decent Plot: No. Good Script: No. Good Direction: No. Good Casting: Hell No. This film is a void with a good theme song, even the film's title doesn't have any meaning, I mean it's a cool title, don't get me wrong, but tell me, what does it mean?This film's plot is all over the place, the story begins with a horse-drugging plot which, spoilers, is left completely unresolved, before shifting to Zorin trying to flood Silicon Valley to take control of the world's micro-chip market (???). It's ridiculous and uninteresting and the resolution to the Silicon Valley plot is resolved with such a cop-out that it was almost not worth writing!The film opens with a ski-chase sequence which while not as cool as the skiing scenes from On her Majesty's Secret Service or The Spy who Loved Me, is still pretty cool, so why they decided to ruin it by playing California Girls I will never know.The first character death of the film is absolutely ridiculous. A French detective who Bond is talking to is kill by May Day who stands at the end of a large room, and uses a fly casting rod, with a hook attacked, and stabs it into his cheek, um, no! Not only do I find the concept of someone being killed by a hook in the cheek absolutely ridiculous, but for me to believe that someone could actually stab someone with a fly casting rod, is too much even for me!Following this is a chase up the Eiffel Tower, where Bond is nearly lifted over the Eiffel Tower with said rod (tut), and this leads to the killer jumping off the Eiffel Tower which was for some reason done is a slow motion cheesy way, that takes all the awesomeness out of the scene.Bond returns to the ground and steals a taxi, this leads to a kinder cool car scene until the roof of the car is completely ripped off by a barrier (whatever), and later in the scene, another car hits the taxi at an angle ripping in in half (seriously?), and then Bond with only the front of the car carries on moving for about two minutes before the thing eventually stops (!!!).I bring up that particular action scene because it's the most ridiculous action scene in the entire film, but later on we still have a pathetically directed fire scene, a daft fire engine chase, a crappy scuffle on the Golden Gate Bridge, and one of the most pathetic Bond girls in the entire series.But first things first, Roger Moore is back for the last time, and just like before he's really cool, but the only problem is that he was 57!!!, when he recorded this film, and considering most of the girls that he somehow falls into bed with in this film are in their mid 20s, it makes for some very awkward scenes. Stacy Sutton played by Tanya Roberts is absolutely pathetic, all she does is scream and get saved by Bond, and at the end of the film, she is captured by Zorin who chases her in a blimp, Seriously? How slow do you have to be running to be court by a flipping blimp. There's no chemistry between her and Bond, nothing to explain why they end up in the shower at the end of the film. Positively Shocking!The only good bit of casting is Christopher Walken, who always make everything 100x better, I don't mind Grace Jones either but I think the casting is a little odd.Overall, I hate this film, it's badly directed, badly written, badly casted, everything just fell flat on it's face in this film, and even Roger Moore and Christopher Walken can't save the pure crappiness here.

188,cartesianthought,5 - Mediocre,5,11 November 2015,"This is a mixed opinion film for me. It did a number of things very well, but all of its merits were inside a fundamentally flawed movie.It has a number of elements which I thought were really well done. Max Zorin does a great job at playing a classic megalomaniac Bond villain. The Golden Gate bridge fight is one of my favorite scenes in the franchise. The Nazi allusions and darker violent elements in the movie with Mortner is a bit creepy and the singular May Day henchwoman as well. I like the self-parody elements like the California Girls' skiing scene and the fact that the Bond series is not afraid to poke fun at itself. I just like the overall classic nostalgic Bond-feeling it has.Unfortunately, there's just too many flaws for it to be a good movie. It spent the first 50 whole minutes on a slow horse-racing plot to lead into the villains' real plan. I nearly fell asleep at certain points in the movie ; it runs a bit long in general. Moore, despite his best efforts, was just too old here. The script should have probably been rewritten for Dalton. The Bond girl is half his age and not believable as a a geologist. The plot is a verbatim clone of Goldfinger. And overall, the movie is slow and lacking in energy.A View to a Kill is the transition point between the classic and the modern Bonds. It has the campy light-hearted spy elements, as well as the darker violent action elements. The former was getting old at that point and the latter was about to take hold.",A View to a Kill

A View to a Kill is a very lame excuse for a Bond film because it doesn't modify to fit Moore's age. It still treats him like a young and macho boy when he should be reading a bedtime story to Tanya Roberts.Well the story is at least interesting this time. We have an 80s version of Goldfinger, where microchip tycoon Max Zorin (played by Christopher Walken of all actors; for me this is good) seeks to destroy California's Silicon Valley and create a monopoly on his chips. Oh did I mention he's a wackjob created in a test tube by a Nazi scientist and trained by the KGB. This guy is completely gone, but he's so damn interesting we have to believe this can happen.In an interesting change of scenery (I am biased because I live in the latter) the major scenes and climax happen in and around both Paris and San Francisco. S.F. leads to a great car chase through the city with a fire truck and eventually the final battle between Zorin and Bond on the wires of the Golden Gate Bridge.Well onto the parts that make me cringe and want to cover my ears in pain. I have mentioned Roger Moore so what else is there. May Day (played by the ugly as I'll ever get out Grace Jones) is just wrong. Really, she's... just... wrong. Tanya Roberts is another girl who as stuck in to look pretty and fawn over James, even she is not good looking. She's also like 30 years younger than Moore so that comes off as awful and creepy. And some of the story, like many since OHMSS, contains quite a lot of filler as I guess they realized their stories and characters were becoming less and less interesting.I can watch A View to a Kill, but only slightly, as this is one of the few times I have viewed it in my life to tell you all about this.

I had fond memories of this but I am sad to say A View to a Kill does not stand the test of time.Many of the 007 staples are absent. No gadget-filled car, replaced by a Rolls Royce. Tanya Roberts as Stacy Sutton (a geologist) barely holds the line of credibility. Given that Geologists aren't exactly millionaires and often work unknown and unnoticed, you wonder how many would turn down a five million dollar cheque.The film is a sprawling mess. Max Zorin (nice turn by Walken) wants to destroy Silicon Valley to push his own computer agenda, but he's part of a German super-soldier program and heralding a horse steroid program while being tracked by a Russian spy (Zorin is Russian?) and May Day is his amazon in the bodyguard role. Jenni Flex gets a passing giggle as a horse trainer and so do a few other things, but overall the film never has the staying power of other Bond titles. You feel Bond is too old to be cavorting with Roberts and that this is a swan song of sorts.Now, A View to a Kill has its moments. May Day dispatching a reluctant investor from the blimp is great, as is the final showdown over the Golden Gate Bridge. Walken's slimy psychosis is passable. Overall though this is a stale Bond movie, showing itself badly in need of a reboot with some fresh ideas and actors. See this to complete your James Bond collection, but don't put it at the front of the list.",A View to a Kill

I wasn't sure about Moore's age, but I never thought he looked 57 at the time, and I can see why it would be his last.  Octopussy was my second Bond, so Moore easily became my favorite actor to play 007 (after Goldeneye it changed to Brosnan).  The score just flowed through me. Roberts is a total airhead but her looks keep her above water as a Bond chick (I thought Alison Doody should have gotten that role myself among all actresses in the movie).  But I liked it enough to become a Bondfan and I have backtracked to get all the Connery films and the Lazenby film, enjoyed the OK version of Bond in Dalton, while the Brosnan era totally rocks. Thank you Roger Moore for inviting me so well into this fun franchise!",A View to a Kill

196,rorymacveigh,Deserves a lot more credit,8,29 August 2012,"Many people feel that this is the weakest Bond ever made and somehow is worse than the implausible Moonraker. But to my mind, this film is great in comparison and would actually come quite a way up my list of Bond movies. The film is the final outing of Roger Moore before he handed over the role to Timothy Dalton and I can see why as he really is looking his age. But even though he may not be as agile as he was and he may need a few more stunt doubles than is necessary, he still does a pretty stand up performance. Christopher Walken also plays an enjoyable bad guy as the psychotic Max Zorin, a Genetically Engineered Child of a Nazi Scientist who has incredible intelligence with the side effect of psychotic behaviour. He plays a really quite complex villain which can go from menacingly calm to psychotically over-the-top.The film follows the story of Bond as he tries to stop the evil Zorin from flooding Silicon Valley near San Francisco by way of causing an earthquake on both faults located in the area. A pretty reasonable story if you think about it. How can Zorin achieve the ability to control Geomorphology? How can Bond stop him? Why does he want to destroy the Valley? Only the movie holds the key.As mentioned, not over the top, quite humorous in places and apart from that, has the best Bond Theme I've heard in a long time, up there with 'You Know My Name' from Casino Royale!",A View to a Kill
197,uroshnor54,One of the Most Enjoyable Bond Movies,10,30 July 2014,"I didn't really pay much attention to the James Bond series until I saw the last half hour of A View to a Kill on TV when a channel (I forget which) was playing all the Bond movies all day long for a few days (because Skyfall was going to be released soon). It was because of that last half hour that I decided to watch all of AVtaK and more movies in the series. I haven't seen all of them yet but I have seen Dr. No, From Russia with Love, Goldfinger, Thunderball, Live and Let Die, The Man with the Golden Gun, The Spy Who Loved Me, Moonraker, For Your Eyes Only, Never Say Never Again (yes, I know it's not an Eon movie), Octopussy, A View to a Kill, The Living Daylights, Tomorrow Never Dies, The World is Not Enough, Casino Royale (2006), and Skyfall. So that's 16 movies plus one non-Eon movie. It's strange, I didn't realize until now that I've seen all of Roger Moore's Bond movies.Anyway, I might lose all of my nonexistent credibility but A View to a Kill is my second favorite of the Bond series (The Spy Who Loved Me is first). And not just because it's nostalgic. I think it's got good action scenes and locations. Christopher Walken is great. Max Zorin is definitely one of the best villains in the series. Grace Jones is pretty good too as Mayday. And Roger Moore really isn't that bad. Yeah, he was 57 at the time of filming but I thought he gave a good last performance as Bond. And I must say I really liked Tanya Roberts.I'm surprised a lot of people think she's one of the worst Bond girls. The plot is pretty good. It's kind of complex without getting convoluted like some other James Bond movies (like Skyfall). It's been said that A View to a Kill has a few similarities to Goldfinger but I didn't (and don't) really mind since I saw it first.Oh yeah, and Duran Duran's title song for AVtaK is my favorite of the series (GoldenEye and Live and Let Die would be a close second and third, respectively) and John Barry's score is also great.",A View to a Kill
198,dieseldemon85,Most underrated of the series,10,20 August 2019,"Not sure why this one gets so much hate. Rating a Bond movie is subjective. Everyone has their personal favorite and this one is mine. Everyone discusses Roger's age and say he was too old for Bond. I disagree, I think as he got older his Bond movies were better. I don't want to give too much away, aside for having the best Bond, you have Christopher Walken playing psycho to the max. Also Grace Jones,and Tanya Roberts who was the girl next door of the Bond girls. Sure she was a bit screamy at times but not her fault alot of females parts were written that way in the 80's. Duran Duran had the best song until Skyfall ,and John Barry produced the best musical score since On her Majesty's secret service (1969). Look for the City Hall scene where Bond climbs down the ladder, with the instrumental version playing in background, has always stood out in mind. This film is different from the other Moore films, he plays it serious and it works well just like in For your eyes only. It really is a good film to kick back with some popcorn on a Saturday/Sunday afternoon. If your one of the haters, go back a re-watch,and look for the other positives I described.",A View to a Kill
199,theskylabadventure,A great Bond romp,8,6 January 2008,"After a series of increasingly camp Moore-Bond movies, the tone of 'A View to a Kill' was surprisingly dark. There's a lot of fun in here, but I can remember being really gripped the very first time I saw this movie.Our baddie here is an entrepreneur called Max Zorin, played with huge finesse by the great Christopher Walken. Zorin, as it turns out, intends to wipe out Silicone Valley by flooding it and only one man can stop him. Okay, so the set up is fairly standard. The pre-title sequence explains Bond's involvement and provides a pleasant piece of action set in Alaska (almost ruined by a stupid and notable unfunny bit of 'surfing', complete with a cheesy Beach Boys cue).Sadly, Roger Moore looks more like he should be waiting in line at the post office than facing off against bad guys. He's pushing 60 years old here, and it really shows. If you can get past that, there are some fantastic action sequences, including a nail-biting escape from a huge fire in San Franciso's City Hall, a tremendous fire engine chase and a fierce punch-up on top of the Golden Gate Bridge.Patrick Macnee appears here for a bit of an in-joke, playing Bond's undercover ally, and some amusing dialogue ensues between them. The Bond-girl is sadly forgettable, especially when you place her next to Grace Jones as a highly original henchman. The real winner here is Christopher Walken, who literally chews the film to pieces and has some of the best bad-guy lines ever. ""Intuitive improvisation is the secret of genius"", he sniggers malevolently.The obligatory inclusion of Q proved a tad too much here, as he appears only to introduce his latest creation - a radio controlled cat, designed for surveillance, which serves no purpose in the movie other than to try and extract a cheap giggle from the audience.Alas, it's easy to forgive the few minor gripes as this movie is largely a winner. Certainly not one of the greats, but at least of one the best Bond movies of the period.",A View to a Kill
200,Dock-Ock,Dance into the Fire.,10,26 November 2001,"With A View To a Kill, the cutain falls on one of the greatest era's in action/adventure movies, as we, EON and the rest of the world bid a fond farewell to Roger Moore's James Bond. And what an exit Moore makes, put simply A View to a Kill is on of the most exciting, stylish, well written and under-rated Bond movies of all time.The basic feel of the movie is pure electric. The series is on a role after the rousing successes that were For Your Eyes Only and Octopussy. Both these movies had represented a maturing point in the series and the shot in the arm of suspense,action and excitement that was needed. This trend is continued to the full with A View To A Kill, and in his goodbye performance Roger Moore manages to remarkably combine all the best elements of his previous Bond movies, and comes up with a perfect way to leave behind Bond and Her Majestys Secret Service.Cubby Broccoli could hardly have awarded Roger a better acolade in wich to leave the series, than to give him the opportunity to act alongside one of America's all time best character/villain actors : Christopher Walken. Walken as Zorin is the best villain in the series since Christopher Lee's Scaramanga in The Man with The Golden Gun. Walken brings a refreshing air of realism and menace combined to put him amngst the great villains of the series. Equally impressive is Grace Jones as MayDay. Jones is the epitomy of a she-hulk and is the very fore of mid 80-s femenism.She strangely manages to be beautiful and frightening in the same breath, and looks fantastic in the action and love making sequences were she lets Bond know who's on top! Then there is Patrick MacNee as Tibbet. Tibbet is a fun character and when posing as Bonds servent early on in the movie Moore takes every opportunity to ad-lib, ordering and bossing MacNee about. In truth it is very amusing to see John Steed carrying Simon Templer's Bags around. It is a petty that MacNee's character is Killed because other Bond movies would have benefited from Macnee's presence. Less succesfull on the character fronts are David Yip, whos character drifts into the movie, seemingly to make the numbers up and is then killed, and of course Tanya Roberts as Stacey Sutton. Sutton makes Brit Ecklands Goodnight look impressive. Roberts looks good, nd the part is well written , so perhaps it is a case of miscasting. Luckily, the beautiful Fiona Fullerton, who may have been a more impressive Stacey Sutton turns up as the tantalisingly sexy Pola Evanova.The action set pieces like in every Bond movie fire and work on all cilendars. There is a wonderfull pre-credits Ski-Chase battle set in a picturesque arctic glacier. The excitement begins in Parris were BJ Worth doubled for grace Jones and parachuted off the Eiffel Tower, and this is imediately followed by a fantastic car chase through the Parrisian locals. This later shifts to a simmilar scene in San Francisco, wich has bon Escape a burning elavator shaft and end up driving a Fire Engine dangling from one] at full speed through the city. And finally to the Golden Gate bridge via Air Balloon were Bond and Zorin battle to death. Here Walken displays all the depth of his character, giving a knowing giggle before plummiting to his death, as though he apreciates the joke is on him.A View to a Kill represents one of the finest scripts in the series, the battle for monopoly over the microchip market. Even if the climax borrows slightly from Superman the Movies flooding of St Andres Fault, or in this case Sillicon Valley. All the elements work. John Barry's Score is his best since On Her Majesty's Secret Service, and the title song by Duran Duran is one of the most energetic and exciting of the series and has quickly becom a standard. In all this is a most satisfying Bond movie. An adequate exit for Roger Moore and one that has stood the test of time well. Thanks Roger and goodbye.",A View to a Kill
201,jubilee77,The fire engine chase scenes are the best.,5,4 July 2007,"Octopussy may have been among the better entries in the Roger Moore era of James Bond and should have heralded Roger Moore's final outing as 007 but he was surprisingly turned out to appear (and one more time) in A View to a kill and being in his 58th year when this film hit the box office, some critics say that he was deemed to be too old for the role of the super-spy. By the time Octopussy was premiered in 1983, Moore was clearly showing his age but in the case of A View to a Kill, he was becoming more and more tired. Some of the film plots in the James Bond movies generally don't seem to work out well but again in the case of this movie, the film makers have clearly lost it as John Glenn simply over-directs and there's also some uncomfortable and unpleasant scenes in this one despite the good levels of action. Rather annoyingly is Grace Jones' part as May Day as she seems to bitch about being deserted and tricked at by Christopher Walken's Max Zorin as he masterminds a terror plot in the Silicon Valley and worst is Tania Roberts' part as the main Bond girl Stacey Sutton. Despite her stunning, dazzling blonde looks and earlier films like the brunette in The Beastmaster, she is simply irritating while squealing out ""Help me, James!"" while my favourite and best part bit of the film was the fire engine chase scenes.",A View to a Kill
202,Zorin-2,Arguably the worst,4,11 April 2001,"In my opinion and a lot of other Bond fans I know, this is the worst James Bond film.

Roger Moore is looking too old to play secret agent 007 and Tanya Roberts is just awful as the Bond girl. All she yells is ""James, James!"" She ranks #1 on the worst Bond girls list. The story is OK, but corny. Bond snowboarding to the tune of a beach boys song in the pre-title sequence, come on!

I personally never cared for the James Bond series after Moonraker. I think the series really lost originality, this is proved to me by the simple fact that Roger Moore still played the character reaching 60. There are impressive stunts in this movie for sure, best of all the chase through Paris. Unfortunately I just don't buy Roger Moore as Bond at this point, he was just too old. Seeing him flirt with women that are the age to be his daughter is just disturbing. The film could've been different if Timothy Dalton was Bond.

It is one of the most best of his films. The action is stronger than many previous films, the music is good and the locations such as France and San Francisco. Roger Moore is great as a Bond actor, especially down to the fact he is 57. Christopher Walken makes a fantastic and one of the very best villains.

The settings are great, the action is awesome, the theme song (despite the horrible pre-movie credits) is one of the best, Christopher Walken plays one of the greatest villains ever, and Roger Moore is just fine. After being wowed by License to Kill recently, I thought Timothy Dalton would have been great in this show. But I was pleased by Moore's performance, and I think it's great that he showed such wonderful support for Cubby Broccoli. However, I do have to agree with everyone else about Tanya Roberts as Stacey Sutton. I believe she could have received a larger role since she was the Bond girl, but she was too American and was pretty helpless and annoying.

It may not reach the ultimate classic scale, but it's one of my favorites, so to say. I can't stop people from not liking this movie, but if you're gonna bomb it, don't be so hard. As another plus, I even want to get the AVTAK DVD for Christmas! And I am not being biased in any way. AVTAK is exciting, has cool villains, and is a great send off for Roger Moore (Who was very good and didn't look old in this one).

208,sterlinrivera-2000,An Underrated Bond Film,9,24 January 2020,"A View to a Kill is what I consider to be an underrated Bond film. It didn't get the respect it deserved when it came out. It was an awesome film and was a great last Moore Bond film.The movie is about James Bond (Roger Moore) obtains a microchip from the body of a dead Russian colleague, and finds out it is for sinister plans. Max Zorin (Christopher Walken) is behind things as he and his bodyguard, May Day (Grace Jones) have a scheme to cause mass destruction. Bond must do everything in his power to stop the both of them, and gets help from Stacey Stutton (Tanya Roberts).This was such a great film. It had some really good action and had a pretty simple story. For one last time, Roger Moore was awesome as Bond, Christopher Walken was a phenomenal villan, and I'm glad they picked a very good actor like him for the role, and Grace Jones was nice as his sidekick, and Tanya Roberts made a solid Bond girl. Many think she's one of the worst, but she had good chemistry with Bond.The fight towards the end is probably the best part and made the film worth it in the end. I don't want to spoil it, but the action and how things went in the finale made the film more satisfying.Overall, A View to a Kill is an underrated Bond Film that is very good all the way through.",A View to a Kill
209,ohroonoko,Bond. Geriatric Bond,7,9 November 2021,"I used to rate this as the worst of the official Bond films, having only seen it once back in the 1980's. But after my most recent viewing (today) it is definitely better than the virtually unwatchable Licence to Kill. At least this film had some funny moments (the rock salt shotgun) and memorable scenes (the Golden Gate Bridge blimp climax). Walken is excellent here, and Grace Jones is an iconic henchman. General Gogol bows out, being in every Roger Moore Bond film since The Spy Who Loved Me. Tanya Roberts is beautiful and she acts better than I remember- comparable to but marginally better than, say, Christmas Jones (TWINE). Patrick Macnee was a lot of fun as Sir Godfrey Tibbett. The shortcomings of this film include weak sets (the silver mine, the horse race track), a lack of cool Q gadgets, and some awkward silliness (the Beach Boys music over the snowboarding).All the film's shortcomings could have been triumphantly overcome if the script and director acknowledged that Roger Moore is pushing 60 and dealt with his age as part of the story. Seducing women 30 years younger is a stretch and a bit creepy. The Bond women should have either been more mature (like Maud Adams on Octopussy), or he could have been intentionally abstinent and respectful, which would be a refreshing new light for us to see James Bond.",A View to a Kill
210,EdwardCarter,Worst Bond movie ever,1,14 August 2008,"This was always going to be an awful movie, but at least a younger actor like Timothy Dalton or Pierce Brosnan might have brought some believability to it. As it is, Roger Moore was ridiculously old at 57 to be playing Bond. At least in ""Never Say Never Again"" Sean Connery, at 52, was playing an ageing Bond on his final mission. Here Bond is still supposed to be in his late thirties. The previous reviewer is right about Moore not looking his age - even with his thickened and dyed hair and cosmetic surgery, he looks at least 60. Patrick Macnee was also far too old - and paunchy - as Bond's sidekick and the fight scenes are just embarrassing. Christopher Walken and Grace Jones were no threat at all and Tanya Roberts must be the worst Bond girl of all, especially with her horrid cigarette voice. Moore should have retired after ""Moonaker"", since he was already over fifty then. Finally in an interview last year he acknowledged, ""I was only about four hundred years too old for the part."" As if all this were not enough, the film has the least glamorous locations for any Bond movie.

Roger Moore plays Bond like a fine wine at this point in the series completely owning his version of 007 with pure instinctual precision.

213,Pinback-4,Moore's swan song,6,23 October 2000,"A lot of people say this is the worst James Bond movie ever, but I don't agree.  The worst is and always will be MOONRAKER.  But yes, there are some problems with A VIEW TO A KILL.  Yes, Roger Moore looks a little too old and should've called it quits after OCTOPUSSY.  Yes, the storyline was recycled from GOLDFINGER.  Yes, Tanya Roberts' character is basically a wimp.  Yes, Christopher Walken is lame.  Yes, Fiona Fullerton's role is way too short. Yes, the firetruck chase is over the top.  Yes, the underground salt mine sequence looks reminiscent of other movies.  Yet in spite of all this, the film is still very entertaining, and never slips into total slapstick like MOONRAKER (where even a pigeon does a double take).  Take the opening teaser sequence.  How can you knock a film that invented snowboarding?  Then there's the jump off the Eiffel Tower.  Pretty smooth.  Patrick Macnee provides some comic relief as Bond's assistant.  There's also a variation of the ""Hoods Convention"" scene from GOLDFINGER, this one taking place in a blimp.  And the fight atop the Golden Gate Bridge ain't so shabby, either. If that's not enough, there's also Alison Doody, pre Indiana Jones 3, and in a really small part as a gunman at the racetrack, a pre-ROCKY IV Dolph Lundgren.

215,Reef-Shark,Walken saves an otherwise forgettable Bond tale,6,30 April 2009,"I can say I am a Bond fan, seeing as I own twenty of the twenty-two movies currently on DVD (as of writing this review). So far the only film I haven't enjoyed in the series has been Roger Moore's Moonraker, just because of the over the top silliness and the obvious sell-out to appeal to moviegoers who had just seen Star Wars.Upon seeing 'A View to a Kill' I instantly was prepared for the worst, and let me tell you this certainly is a bad Bond film. Moore is showing his obvious age, making the relations with his leading ladies undeniably awkward, to say the least. The plot is as simple as they come, and none of the actors are really given any chance with the dialogue they have been given. Moore has very few witty comments in this movie, and most of the other characters are cardboard cut outs.One thing however manages to make this film better than Moonraker. This is the under-appreciated role of Max Zorin, played by the always wonderful Christopher Walken. I can say without a doubt in my mind that Walken is the single saving grace in this film, exhibiting everything any good Bond villain needs.Exotic locations: Check! Unique henchmen/henchwoman: Check! Surrounded by beautiful girls: Check Cold and ruthless attitude: Double check! Heartless and chilling disregard for henchmen life: CHECK Walken, with a horrid script (every character in this movie is poorly written) is able to create one of the best Bond villains I've ever seen! The way he talks, the way he acts, everything he does showcases his undeniable talent. So for a movie like 'A View to a Kill' Walken's performance is like shifting through sewage and finding a large diamond ring.It is because of Walken that I recommend this movie and give it a relatively good rating. Everything else about this film is really forgettable. You'd think a super-strong female henchwoman would make for a memorable moment in the franchise, but this is so poorly handled that she winds up as one of the most forgettable characters in the series, as opposed to one of the best.Roger Moore, unfortunately, ends his career on Bond in perhaps his own worst performance, which is undeniably sad. It seems that all Bond actors seem to end their careers on the lowest of their films (Connery with 'Diamonds are Forever', Brosnan with 'Die Another Day', and though Dalton was a great Bond, I have to say 'License to Kill' was a weak film) but with those films it has always been more the scripts fault, as opposed to the actor's talent (all three tried their best with the material). Moore is just plain stiff in his last entry! The man seems to have totally lost interest in playing the character by this point.I consider 1979's 'Moonraker' Moore's worst, but like 'Diamonds are Forever', and 'Die Another Day', Moonraker was more the fault of the script writers; not the Bond actor. In 'A View to a Kill' Moore really shows that he is no longer capable of playing the part, and that is the saddest part of the film (especially seeing Moore seducing girls much younger than himself, with his developing turkey neck becoming quite obvious). Walken makes the movie an enjoyable, B-grade action movie, but as for Bond, this is where it becomes an undeniable fact that Moore has overstayed his welcome as Agent 007.Moore deserved a better ending, and the fact is that he just shouldn't have come back for this film. Octopussy may have actually been a decent departure, but Moore decided to try one last time and it really is the straw that breaks the Moore Bond's back. Enough was enough, and Moore failed to recognize when he should have cried ""when!"" I give this film a decent rating for the performance of Christopher Walken, but everything else is very low, and forgettable. Go and see it for Walken, but it is sad to see Moore's finally desperate breaths as he tries to keep the character going one last time.",A View to a Kill
216,tomasg-69814,"Poor, Sad Farewell From Moore.",5,6 February 2016,"To avoid any misunderstanding; I'm not intending on any complaining on Roger Moore's achievement in this film. Since For Your Eyes only he had been contracted movie by movie. While the production team couldn't solve the problem of refreshing the casting, in half a decade, they played it safe and fell back on Roger Moore for a total of three times. But it's Moore's own less favorite, and mine also. To me, it's just too mid 80's. Too mid 80's....Why involve such people as amazing Grace miss Jones? A mediocre 80's pop-artist who just wanted to strengthen her media limelight power by appearing in a Bond movie. Such failure from the production team. (Bet her record company pumped in a lot of money to assure her appearance.) And the theme song? Artificial, plastic and stone dead music from one of the most overrated ""pop""-bands ever. I rather listen to the hairdryer from one of the fashion boys in Duran Duran than this tune. This song marks the all time bottom of James Bond Soundtracks. (Even WHAM! would have done it better by this time...a sophisticated ballad from George Michael could have saved much.)The villain story itself, about computer meltdown for the U.S by drowning Silicon Valley, is just a modern version of old ""Blofeld stuff"". (But I think Christopher Walken portraits the mentally disturbed industrialist quite well. A defector from cold Russia and KGB, who's current independence and plans discomforts his former employers.)Tanya Roberts (former angel from the fifth and last season of TV-show ""Charlie's Angels"", for instance) is easily forgotten every sometime I revisit this movie. Actor skills enough for being a sexy cut-out doll in heavy makeup, hairspray, and tight designer jeans. Not 007 material.Roger Moore was at 57 of age, and well aware of the slight silliness of him trying to appear on the screen as a ""lethal weapon"". And by his own admission, he did not get along with any of the leading women, neither Roberts nor Jones. (Jones was occasionally really obnoxious, crew members testified in interviews later.) I don't want to criticize Roger at all for his work in this movie, but I bet he was quite relieved once the shooting finished, and the scene door closed behind him. Changes were on the way....at last for some actor(s).",A View to a Kill
217,louiss,Even a bad Bond movie is still good fun,6,15 December 1998,"I've been an avid James Bond fan since seeing Goldfinger in 1964. I have since seen every Bond film at a cinema as well as many times on TV. When I walked out of the theater after seeing VTAK in 1985 I was very discouraged and was concerned this could have been the end of my favorite film series. Roger Moore looking good at 56-57 was still far too old to play Bond and it was very obvious that a double was doing most of the action. I also had never cared for Moore as Bond. His films bordered on spoofs rather than thrillers and he never convinced me he was a real womanizer. In VTAK this shortcoming was magnified with his age and made his romantic scenes all the More implausible. Not only was Moore too old but much of the cast looked like a bunch of old fogies Patrick McCnee, Jeffrey Keen, Walter Gottell, Lois Maxwell ETC. The film also seemed to be a jumbled mess of other Bond films rehashed as well as Superman. There were no elaborate sets or exotic locales and nothing memorable or exciting about any of the action. The pre credit sequence was quite good until the nonsense with the Beach Boy's music plays while Bond surfs across the snow and ice . The chopped car and fire truck chase were both embarrassing and represented the absolute low points for the entire series. There were a few positives - John Barry's score and Duran Duran's title song along with Binder's credits were excellent. I did like Christopher Walken and Grace Jones even though Walken was a little over the top he was a fun villain and better than most in Moore Bond's. Tanya Roberts knocked Barbara Bach off as the worst actress to play a Bond Girl however. I was sad Roger's last Bond outing was this bad.. Fortunately the Bond series did survive and the 4 films since are all much better.  With all this said somehow over the years this film has grown on me. It has become a guilty pleasure and already having established in my mind that it was a bad film I've found some new things about it I enjoy. The climax of the film with the flooding of the mine is quite spectacular and I'm amused by Zorin's execution of all his men. I also enjoy the fight on Golden Gate Bridge. Roger Moore even display's a rare very brief bit of acting when he is enraged by Zorin's execution of Tracy's old boss. The scene with Bond breathing underwater via a tire stem reminds me of the type of resolve Bond exhibited more in the novels than on film which gave a little credibility to his predicament rather than the usual handy gadget saving his life. So now that time has passed I still regard this as one of the worst James Bond films and yet I still find it entertaining and fun more so than when I originally saw it.",A View to a Kill

219,d-apergis,mainly tired,6,27 December 2009,"Suspension of disbelief past breaking point is kindly asked from the audience at the sight of 58-year-old Roger Moore, hastily lured back for one last gig as Bond and sporting a creepy toupee and a dismal tan. This fact alone doesn't give the film much room to manoeuvre, yet somehow the film just about manages to pull this off thanks mainly to John Barry's soundtrack, Alan Hume's interesting cinematography, an amusing Christopher Walken and a couple of effective pieces atop the Eifel Tower and the Golden Gate Bridge. Otherwise, this is mainly tired, aspiring to be nothing more than what it delivers to an audience that no longer expects more than it gets. Bond's eventual teaming up with henchwoman Mayday (played by the deliciously eccentric Grace Jones) in the film's last section is the series' indisputably all-time lowest point.",A View to a Kill
220,jackhamel1987,This could have been so much more.,5,8 April 2013,"A View to a Kill was (thankfully), the final Roger Moore entry. The real tragedy here is that this could and should have been a classy film to add to the Bond franchise. This could have been the best of Moore's entries, if only it hadn't handled the plot so clumsily. As plots go, this had a brilliant basic plot in industrial espionage, that descends into a total joke because of the obsession of with turning some scenes into so called 'light-hearted' entertainment. We start in Siberia, where Bond has been sent to recover a stolen microchip. After an impressive chase (ruined by the adding of 'Beach Boys' at the most crucial moment), Bond finds himself on the trail of industrialist Max Zorin, who is a billionaire tycoon, financed by the KGB. However, Zorin has gone rogue, and has a plan on his own to detonate a nuclear bomb on the San Andreas fault, causing a massive earthquake that would wipe out Silicone Valley and leave him in control of the microchip market. It's a dreadful shame that this film throws away a brilliant plot in favour of a totally cartoonish production. Mircroships were the big thing when this film came out, and had the film focused more on the industrial espionage angle between the capitalist west and the communist east, this would have made for a stronger film throughout. However, they tried to give Zorin a more super-villain feel (even though he didn't need it), and the plot loses it when we learn that Zorin wants to destroy Silicone Valley. It's just not remotely believable, and handled poorly. We also have to put up with the worst Bond girl in Tanya Roberts Stacey Sutton, who spends all her time screaming and getting in the way. A pointless character, not acted well, not written well, adds nothing to the film. In its defence, A View to a Kill has some stunning actions sequences. The Eiffel Tower scene is brilliant, the scenes at Zorin's house are brilliant, and the finale on the Golden Gate Bridge is the best finale in a Moore film, and one of the best in any Bond film. But these aren't't enough to off-set the damage done by the Beach Boys song, the cartoonish car chase, and the massacre scene in which Zorin manages to kill hundreds of miners with one Uzi, and one clip. Even Christopher Walken, who I think makes a cracking Bond villain in Max Zorin, can't make haul this up further than average. Average at 5/10. Good in points, bad in points.",A View to a Kill
221,MondoMirth,What a view,6,3 January 2020,"Best Bond opening theme. The story is not very exciting and almost not ridiculous enough for a bond film. The villain is a interesting concept, but not well executed in the plot or by Walken's perfomance, a fair bit of classic bond humor, but no real substance.",A View to a Kill
222,A_Friend_of_Sarah_Connor,Moore's last film is far from his best (SPOILERS),5,1 January 2005,"Seemingly from the start of production, the 14th James Bond adventure, ""A View To A Kill"", was destined to fail. Roger Moore, playing Bond for the seventh time, was almost in his sixties; the script was a poor rehash of ""Goldfinger""; and during filming, the infamous ""007 Stage"" burned to the ground. Ever since it's theatrical release, AVTAK has been slammed mercilessly by most Bond fans, being seen as one of the worst examples of Ian Fleming's secret agent. In reality, while the cons outweigh the pros, there are some individual aspects that work on their own and nearly keep the film afloat. The single worst thing about the movie is that's it's boring. This can be contributed to John Glen's workmanlike direction, which doesn't show any signs of enthusiasm. The flow is sluggish and the poor screenplay moves forward only to take up the 130 minute running length. And it's not only Glen who's disinterested; nearly the whole crew seems to be suffering from burnout, from Peter Lamont's lackluster set design, to weak cinematography, to a cast that looks like it should be collecting its pension. Like most of the Bond films of the 1980's, ""A View To A Kill"" took it's name from a short story by Ian Fleming. Unlike others, however, that's all that was kept and Fleming's plot about ambushed dispatch drivers was ditched in favour for a more modern storyline. Max Zorin (Christopher Walken) has come up with a scheme to monopolize the world's microchips by detonating a bomb on the San Andreas Fault line, which would flood Silicon Valley, the chief exporter of computer chips. Bond is sent in to stop him at all costs. That's it. Pretty under-whelming, huh? Not only is this boring, but it blatantly copies the plots of ""Goldfinger"", and 1978's ""Superman"". On top of that, the reasoning for the plan doesn't make a lot of sense. Destroying Silicon Valley wouldn't wipe out microchips for good; Zorin would definitely prosper from the chaos, but that would be short-lived. To get to this point, however, you would have to endure a plodding pace that doesn't seem to ever get anywhere. Add at least two useless sub-plots (horses on steroids and something about polluting San Francisco Bay) and you got yourself a guaranteed snoozer.The cast is unremarkable and as I mentioned earlier, way too old. The only two who have any spark are Walken and Patrick Macnee as Bond's ally, Tibbett. Macnee plays the role with sufficient humor and his fate is one of the better-handled aspects of the film while Walken infuses Zorin with an energy that's absent from the rest of the film. The scene where he guns down a group of miners while laughingly hysterically immediately puts him in the top-tier of Bond villains and, of course, the usual Walken ticks are present (except he doesn't sing or dance). The only problem I have with Zorin is that he comes up with what could be described as the dumbest ways to try to kill Bond, but that's the fault of the screenwriters, not Walken. Then we have a trio of actors who are possibly the worst leads in a Bond film: Sir Roger, Tanya Roberts as Stacy Sutton, and Grace Jones as May Day. Moore, having seen better days with ""For Your Eyes Only"" is completely unbelievable as a secret agent. While he's still a bit too old in ""Octopussy"", at least in that film he puts some effort into the role and his recasting spared us James Brolin. Meanwhile, Stacy Sutton is a shrill and frankly dumb character (case in point: a blimp sneaks up on her) and Roberts does the character no service by putting in a performance that doesn't once convince us that she's a geologist. Finally, Grace Jones isn't exactly an attractive woman and the fact that she sleeps with Bond is enough to give anyone a chill down their spine. AVTAK would also be Lois Maxwell's last film as Miss Monneypenny and it proves that a 57-year-old Bond shouldn't be flirting with a 58-year-old secretary!The film is also almost completely deficient in any decent action sequences. Most of the film is spent developing the plot and when the action does come, Glen is unable to make it work. The worst offender in the fire truck chase; it contains pathetic gags similar to ""Moonraker"", obvious shots of stunt men, and a stupid sheriff in the vein of J. W. Pepper, yet it's still boring. There's also an uninspired opening ski chase that tries to replicate ""The Spy Who Loved Me"" with little success. That sequence is topped off with the absolute worst use of a song in the Bond franchise. About the only scene worth mentioning is the finale, not because the movie's coming to an end, but because it's inspired and looks real.With the overall blandness of the film, it's surprising to see some positives pop up once in a while. John Barry's great score is easily the best thing about the whole movie. Barry comes up with a rich variety of cues and uses Duran Duran's lively song to fantastic effect. There's also a refreshing attempt at some realism (perhaps that's why the locations are fairly dull) and the stunts are up to usual Bond standard.Unfortunately, the final verdict on AVTAK is that it's a completely misguided Bond film. Veering from forced seriousness to slapstick, it put doubt in most people's minds if James Bond was even necessary anymore. If Moore had stopped after ""Octopussy"", I feel it would've been the only time in the series when history wouldn't have been drastically altered (in terms of actor changes) and Timothy Dalton probably would've gotten a longer tenure. Tolerable if you're in the right mood, but the negatives eventually sink the production and prevent it from regaining the little momentum that it had in the first place. 4.5/10",A View to a Kill
223,asdodge,Should never have been made,3,12 December 2008,"This is, without much doubt, the lamest and worst of the Bond Flicks. Although I like all the James Bonds equally and have no favorites, Moore was too old and out of shape for this one. The plot and script were chaotic and pretentious, and the acting by most main characters was just sad. Christopher Walken plays... well, Christopher Walken. Another top-ranked actor who always seems to be the same in every movie- not much acting required, apparently. Grace Jones plays the same character she plays in ""Conan the Destroyer."" Moore's face-lifts are more noticeable and even the expected ""Bond Girls"" are less glamorous (though Tanya Roberts is cute enough) and less talented acting-wise. The expected chase scenes, explosions, mad-man's plot for massive destruction are all there, and all so tired and empty this time around. Some may enjoy the cookie-cutter formulaic stuff, but it just all seems so lost here. This is the one movie that should have been recalled/delayed/changed... etc. The plot involves microchip guru Max Zorin (Walken) who is actually the product of Nazi genetic experimentation to make a ""super-human."" Zorin's microchip deals come into question when Bond, in the pre-titles sequence, discovers a Zorin microchip in Siberia. This microchip is impervious to electro-magnetic pulses (like after Atomic Bombs), unlike regular microchips. Bond's investigations into Zorin's activities find that he is an ex-KGB agent and out to corner the Microchip world by destroying Silicon Valley. It also steals some plot devices from the first ""Superman"" movie- done even more sadly here. The fact that the plot deals with microchip technology (in 1985) lends some to say how topical it is, or even ahead of its time, but at the time it seemed predictable and dry,and has only worsened over the years. Along with Moonraker and Die Another Day, this is one I can not watch uninterrupted, even when doing a Bond-a-thon.",A View to a Kill

Grace Jones as Walken's bodyguard was a good casting decision, because she could transmit evil and menacing. But Tanya Roberts as Stacy Sutton, Bond's girlfriend, was awful. Sure, she looks good, but Ms. Roberts is an awful actress. Wooden and vacuous, and her character seemed extremely helpless without Bond.

EVERYTHING, it seems, was thrown at this film in an attempt to make it bigger and bolder and better than what came before. As any sensible moviegoer knows, the moment one attempts to make a good movie by doing it that way the worse the result will be. The only redeeming feature of this film is the kitschy time-capsule quality it offers the viewer and even that doesn't sustain it for long. The plot is thin as a cup of tea, Roger tries to pull it off but he's given nothing to work with, it's just a silly mess. I laughed out loud at the scene where the Renault runs with it's rear end missing - IF ONLY Renault cars were that reliable! I've always been a Roger Moore fan. His ""Bond"" is the debonnaire gentleman and he's charming to watch. In this outing he was turned not into an action character but a cartoon one and it's disappointing. Lastly the direction is abominable. Watch the scene midway through at a gas station when the camera pans from left to right and ends up focused on the Rolls.

230,mcfische,The NSNA of the official series,5,13 September 2003,"Spoilers""A View To A Kill"" was not intended to be the end of Roger Moore's career as 007. While he enjoyed the part, he had been thinking ever since ""For Your Eyes Only"" that he was looking too old for the part and that if he continued romancing young women at the age of 60, then the series would become quite perverted and dirty. Finally, he agreed to do one final James Bond film, ""A View To A Kill,"" establishing the record of playing James Bond seven times. But unfortunately, he has a lousy farewell. This film is the ""Never Say Never Again"" of the official series; IT STINKS ON ICE!! BOO!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!This film is a complete disaster, with it's only redeeming qualities being Moore, Patrick Macnee as the ill-fated ""chauffer,"" , the villains, and General Gogol's reappearance. Other than that, everything about this film stinks. Bond's women in this film are a femme fatal as they are called and a blonde. The femme fatal is interesting; she's the Xenia Onatopp of Moore's films, but the short hair and too much make-up make her look horrible. The other; ABSOLUTELY PATHETIC! All Stacey does is scream, plead for help, and bumble her way through everything, making it worse. The actress is good, but nobody could EVER bring anything interesting to this character! The M, Q, and Moneypenny scenes are horribally written. So far, Robert Brown, while a good actor, fails to even compare with Bernard Lee. Moneypenny looks ancient and although I love Lois Maxwell in the part, I must say I'm glad they let her go after this. Her scenes with Roger Moore were never as good as they were with Connery or Lazenby. As for Q, after his great, deserved role in ""Octopussy,"" he makes two cameos at the beginning and end of the film. That was alright in OHMSS; that was a down-to-Earth Bond with no gadgets, but this film is LOADED with RIDICULOUS gadgets, so Q should've had a bigger part. The film seems like a horrible re-make of ""Goldfinger"" and I can't WAIT to get ""The Living Daylights"" and see a (hopefully) better Bond! I give this one a 1 out of 10, it's single saving grace the points I names at the top.AVTAK...ICK!",A View to a Kill
231,QoS007,Worst Moore film. One of the worst in the series.,2,9 July 2008,"Where to begin with this travesty of a Bond film...I'll start by mentioning the one good point of the film. I rather enjoyed the opening theme by Duran Duran, even though I strongly disliked the visual aspect of it.Easily one of the worst Bond films in history, AVTAK accomplished the same thing that Connery and Brosnan's last films did for them.With Moore now into his late 50's, we see that he should have called it quits with Octopussy or even For Your Eyes Only. The films starts off with one of the absolute worst sequences with Bond 'snow surfing' to the song of California Girls. I would ask the producers what they were thinking when they decided to have an almost 60 year old looking Bond try to pull off stunts that most 30 year old can't pull off, but I'm sure they are thinking that already. Also, where is the classic Bond score during a scene like this??? What an abomination. I would discuss Bond's escape into a miniature submarine disguised as an iceberg, but I would rather not have you think about it.I won't go into great detail concerning the plot, because I feel like it isn't even worth mentioning. With some Bond films I can easily say that the plot was a great idea, but poorly conceived. This is not one of those times. The plot is extremely choppy, campy, and drags in almost every scene. From beginning to end I kept thinking to myself: 1) Is it really getting this much worse? 2) How is it possible that they messed up a Bond movie like this after two great films back-to-back? The climax, or lack there of, was short and completely loony. Watching 57 year old Moore playing Bond in some of the most overblown stunts in the franchise's history was more than laughable. I was more than happy when the credits started to roll.Even though Christopher Walken is a great actor, he played one of the worst Bond villains. He mannerisms and overall appearance were frustrating and ill-timed. Grace Jones, while quite gritty in AVTAK, ended up falling short as well. The one thing that prevents me from watching this movie entirely anymore, is Tanya Roberts as Stacey Hutton. Again, why would the producers allow the footage that they shot of her to even enter into a theater? Her constant shrieking and crying is worse than that of a 2 year old. She played no part in Bond's mission and was a complete hindrance.2/10",A View to a Kill

The music score by John Barry is the best ever in a Bond-film. Even the title song with Duran Duran is great. The opening sequence is great, apart from the Beach Boys music (what were they thinking?). Grace Jones does a good job, and so does most other actors. Tanya Roberts, on the other hand, brings the experience down quite a bit. So does the strange massacre at the end, which is pretty gruesome actually and not really necessary.

Moore bowed out of the series, just in time (well, at least close to it...) and with a serious bang. Christopher Walken is deliciously evil and psychopathic as Mack Zorin, the Nazi engineered genius looking to take over the tech industry by destroying Silicon Valley with a major flood disaster and earthquake. He is definitely one of the best movie villains ever. Along with some of the best music scoring of all the films in the series, including the fantastic Duran Duran song which epitomizes the 80's, the final showdown between Zorin and Bond on top of the golden gate bridge is breathtakingly exciting. I get goose bumps watching the ending! Many people hate this entry in the 007 series, calling it cheezy, clichéd, and that Moore is just too hammy and way too old. I disagree. I claim to be a true Bond-phile, having seen every film many times over, and have read every one of the most excellent (and quite different from the films) Fleming novels (btw the Fleming short story View to a Kill is actually the basis for the films Live and Let Die and For Your Eyes Only) and find that this is definitely one of my favourites.

238,bass-player-blues,Excels in many overlooked areas...,8,5 March 2019,"As an avid Bond fan ""A View to a Kill"" is actually one of my favorites to re-watch despite generally being considered the worst Roger Moore flick. I think it's a superior film to both ""Moonraker"" and ""Octopussy"" with levels of viewer satisfaction often on par with the more highly regarded films. I think the biggest factor with the overall disapproval is that it's a new look for Bond. Everyone was fond of the classic campy outlandishness present in the other films while ""A View to a Kill"" blends that with a darker, fresh 80's feel. It's a precursor to the Timothy Dalton films while ""Octopussy"" before it was more of a parody of itself than any other Bond film. So in that regard it's highly enjoyable as a hybrid between the Moore Bonds and Dalton's, largely giving you the best of both worlds.One new element in ""A View to a Kill"" is the feel of the villain. This, like other new elements likely represents further reason for the lower reception... Zorin is quite possibly the first Bond villain that isn't likable at all and really gets under your skin. While most other Bond villains want to destroy the world, you actually find likeness to them and scenes where they elaborately kill people are laughable. Zorin doesn't send people to the shark tank to meet their demise, he mows them down with a machine gun in a scene that is rather hard to watch. Nonetheless, I think Christopher Walkin did a great job in this role as a new more menacing bad guy. His backstory involving his high IQ and psychotic behavior being the result of Nazi experiments on pregnant mothers is also extremely creative and eerie.Tanya Roberts always gets bashed for her acting in this. Honestly I actually like her as the Bond Girl. She sorta comes across like a real California 80's blonde which I like. Duran Duran's title track is an 80's classic and the rest of the score especially during action scenes like the bridge fight is very powerful.",A View to a Kill
239,Orpington,Arthritic conclusion to the Moore years,5,15 September 2004,"Roger Moore initially intended to walk away from the Bond franchise after finishing Octopussy, which was a not unreasonable decision, given that he was now moving into his late fifties. Cubby Broccoli, however, persuaded him to stay on to make A View to a Kill, which thus became Moore's seventh Bond film, and also his last. Sadly, AVTAK is far from being a great farewell for the man who has starred in more official Bond movies than anyone else, as it is a dull film, devoid of real inspiration and unable to rouse itself from torpor.Funnily enough, in spite of his age Moore's performance is one of the better things about the film, as he plays it fairly straight and does not just sleepwalk his way through, as he had been guilty of in some of his earlier outings. However, by now there was no hiding the fact that Moore was simply too old to still be playing James Bond; he had got away with it in For Your Eyes Only and (just) in Octopussy, but in AVTAK you can see the wrinkles clearly, and the credibility of the film is thus undermined from the start. It does not help matters that we see him in intimate scenes with a number of (much younger) women, most distressingly in bed with the Amazonian Grace Jones, a sight that is not for the faint-hearted. A jacuzzi scene with Fiona Fullerton also gives us ample opportunity to survey Moore's ageing body, and it does leave you wishing he had quit before this film.Many others in the cast of AVTAK are of advancing years, including Willoughby Gray as an evil German scientist, Patrick Macnee as Bond's ally Tibbett, and Lois Maxwell, making her fourteenth and final appearance as a by now distinctly matronly Moneypenny. All of them give good performances, but the preponderance of ageing stars certainly helps to rob the film of real dynamism, and little in the way of sexual frisson can be generated between a Bond and a Moneypenny who are both a short way off collecting their bus passes. At least there is good nostalgia value in seeing Moore and Macnee, the Saint and the Avenger, working together and clearly enjoying doing so, and Macnee is very enjoyable in his role.In fairness, the age of the cast wouldn't matter so much if the film was exciting, but sadly the pace is pedestrian and the story never takes off. From a deeply unimaginative pre-title sequence, which sees OO7 involved in yet another ski chase, AVTAK is quite happy to be Bond-by-numbers, and John Glen directs with less spark than in his other Bond films. The action scenes are uninspired and, in the case of a fire engine chase through San Francisco, pretty stupid, with only the final showdown on the Golden Gate Bridge generating any real excitement. There is also some horrendous back projection, which is quite incredible for a film made in the mid-80s, and just adds to its creaky feel. The villains, sadly, don't really give a lift to proceedings, even though Christopher Walken plays the psychotic industrialist Max Zorin, Bond's main opponent. Walken tries his best with the character, certainly making him nutty and disturbed, but the limitations of the script prevent him from making Zorin a convincing villain, and it is ultimately an unsuccessful performance. Grace Jones is more effective as May Day, mainly because she is such an imposing and intimidating figure, but the effect is rather spoiled when she is finally allowed to open her mouth towards the end. Someone else who opens her mouth far too much is the irritating Tanya Roberts as Stacy Sutton, who we are supposed to believe is a geologist but does little more than scream a lot. Undoubtedly, she is one of the worst Bond girls ever.AVTAK is without question the worst Bond film of the 80s, and certainly one of the weaker entries in the franchise. Its only real saving graces are a handful of good performances and Duran Duran's dynamic title song, the last truly classic Bond theme. It is a pity Moore had to go out in this way; he may not have been the best Bond, but he turned in some effective performances during his reign, and ensured the continuation of the series. Some new blood and a new direction were, however, now needed urgently, and thankfully they would arrive in the next chapter of the Bond saga.",A View to a Kill
240,FreddieLee04,A View to a Kill- An Overlooked Bond Movie,4,30 December 2018,"While Playing Bond in 'A View To a Kill', Roger Moore is going on 60, and he is surprisingly good still after his first appearance in the early 1970s. For me, A View To A Kill is seriously overlooked and given hate for no reason, i enjoy it. A Bit of a Bond Guilty pleasure!",A View to a Kill
241,Bel Ludovic,All hail Duran Duran,4,2 December 2002,"This was the first Bond film I ever saw, aged 9 years old  and back in 1985, I thought it was the bee's knees. But with age comes a familiarity with the Bond back catalogue and an understanding of what makes a good film or not. And with every viewing AVTAK sinks further, to the near-bottom of the stack. Like many poor Bond films, the first 30 to 60 minutes are fine, only to deteriorate when the film's action moves to its final or penultimate setting. (Spoilers ahead.) The San Francisco scenes are simply dreadful, not only because of the ubiquity therein of the worst Bond girl ever, Tanya Roberts as Stacey Sutton, but because the film feels so tired and uninspired. We see Bond bake quiche, we see Bond fall asleep in a chair. Wow. Living on the edge there. The fire at the City Hall scene is terrible from start to finish; Bond's rescue and the over-dramatically heroic music that accompanies it are cringe-making, as is the fire engine escape. I don't generally like it when Bond films are set in America, because, in a world when most major films are set and produced in the United States, Bond films' glamorous locations provide new scenery that make them stand out from the rest. But when they're set in America they somehow feel more mundane and less interesting. And that's what makes me think the whole San Francisco scenes have the production values of a TV movie. That and Tanya Roberts' appalling acting and interminable wailing. On the plus side, the vast majority of John Barry's score is superb, possibly his best ever, and Duran Duran's punchy, dynamic title track attempted to take the Bond theme tune in a new direction, admirably succeeding in a way that Madonna quite clearly didn't. Together with the inclusion of Grace Jones in the cast, the film is lent a contemporary mid-1980s air that it would otherwise lack. Christopher Walken is a suitably demented villain, but his cabal is fairly humdrum. Roger Moore, despite the advancing years, acts with a measured seriousness, and, combined with a facelift, just about pulls it off. But this 007 yarn is dull and naff, and screaming for a regime change.",A View to a Kill
242,eil-2,Triumphant or Tired?,4,2 April 2001,"A View to a Kill was Roger Moore's last Bond film, unfortunately. Moore was excellent in the previous two Bonds but his role is tired and 2D here, much like the rest of the movie. The plot (involving destroying Silicon Valley) simply smacks of Goldfinger, the cast struggle to look credible, and the humour is either sexist or racist. On the other hand, John Barry's score is his best in the 80's, and Christopher Walken, as Max Zorin, the psychopathic villain, is superb, so much so that you begin to root for him. So, all in all, a wasted opportunity which would have been so much better had Timothy Dalton played Bond.",A View to a Kill
243,kt3234-1,We need a film with an older James Bond,4,3 November 2008,"While this James Bond adventure is lackluster, it shouldn't detract from the overall quality of the performances found within it.Take Zorin, for example, played by Christopher Walken. Zorin is calculating, cruel, and sadistic, and in my opinion, one of the best Bond villains in years. Grace Jones is surprisingly effective at her deliverance of lines and her acting ability. But let's be fair, she didn't have to do much.Moore is a different story. Again, in my opinion, this is his best portrayal of Bond. First and foremost, because he is older. I felt the series started slipping long ago, because the character never got older, or slower, or weaker. Moore is. His tired expressions give new life to the character. The series needs an older Bond. How else can they hope to re-invent themselves? Yes, we're treated to the tired clichés of EVERYBODY, including Moore. I would think because Moore had been older filming, he would have been more cynical, or colder. Connery was in his last outing as Bond.Yes, the story is bad. Laughably bad. We've seen it time and time again. Same old, same old. And yes, we're treated to the strange Harold and Maude like scenes of Moore with his much younger costars.If nothing else, watch the film for the older Roger Moore, and think, does the series need an older Bond? The answer is an emphatic YES.",A View to a Kill
244,marnixtenbrinke,A view to retirement,6,20 November 2008,"After six Bond movies, Moore was beginning to show his age. He wasn't planning on starring in another 007 movie, but it happened anyway.A View To A Kill isn't the worst Bond movie ever, but it certainly isn't one of the better ones.Compared to the previous one, this one can't match up. Moore doesn't seem to have much fun anymore, the storyline seems recycled and the acting of the other actors isn't very convincing. There is a severe lack in humor, unusual for a Bond movie starring Moore.The film didn't do too well financially and critically, which isn't much of a surprise. It was time for something new.",A View to a Kill
245,Enforcer686,A Worthy Entry to the Moore Collection,8,4 December 2010,"I've seen several here say Moore was too old---Moore himself said it on the DVD extra----but the fact remains, I don't think there was anyone anywhere that could have done a better job for this film at that time. Dalton certainly dropped the torch when it was handed to him, although the series recovered with Pierce. Bond is a distinguished British gentleman of high culture, he was never intended to be a brash young action hero. You can't find the kind of class Moore has in young upstarts, it takes time to attain it. I think Moore did a great job, although the story wasn't as strong as some of the other Moore films.For one thing, there was a lack of exotic locations, always a huge part of the Bond mystique. And I never understood why Grace Jones had a moment of fame in the '80s (what was her talent, exactly?). But the incomparable Christopher Walken was devilish and unrepentant as a Nazi-bred villain and some of the other staples of the Bond series were there in fine form. Tanya Roberts was utterly lacking in depth and lacked the smoldering, mysterious sex appeal a Bond girl should have, but she was certainly beautiful. In the end, Moore delivered the goods, which is why I still treasure the film. And the '80s modernism thing is captured 100% by Duran Duran's great theme song, one of the very best Bond themes ever and a huge pop hit for the band, which was at its peak around this time. It must be a great honor for British citizens to be asked to perform a Bond theme! Well anyone, but especially for Brits. If you can only see one Moore film in the short term, check out The Spy Who Loved Me or For Your Eyes Only first, but make sure you eventually catch this one, too.",A View to a Kill
246,thomas-williamson-ga,What a letdown !!,5,26 March 2011,"FYI: Roger Moore was scheduled to have ended his career as James Bond after Octopussy and Timothy Dalton was going to start his take as the 00 Agent in View To a Kill. Well, for whatever reason unbeknowest to me this didn't happen for Dalton until Living Daylights. Regardless, View To a Kill is a definite disappointment to the 007 series and I disliked it as much as I did Thunderball but that is an entirely different review altogether. Moving on, I have heard it said that Tanya Roberts who played the bond girl in this film ""couldn't act her way out of a paper bag"". Well, I seriously have to agree. She was one of the worst bond girls in the entire series of 007. In fairness to Tanya she is (or was) very good looking at the time. As for the other female lead, Grace Jones was labeled by a lot of viewers as being too masculine for her role and I also must agree with that. As for the villain, Christopher Walkin is one of my favorite actors of all time but not even his character could do much to save this film from ultimately being a stinker. Overall, the story is weak and so is the acting even on Roger Moore's part. Seriously.. it looked as if Moore was ready to throw in the towel before completion of this movie. Very seldomly do I agree with so-called professional critics but in the case of View To a Kill I have to make an exception. To be a bit fair, this might entertain viewers on the first watch yet I am very positive most will not want to see it a second time. I've sat through this movie three times and it was twice too many. While it would have been interesting to see what Timothy Dalton might have brought to View To a Kill in terms of Bond's character, I doubt very highly it would have made much difference to the overall production. One positive comment I will make is that View To a Kill has a good theme song by one of the great euro bands of the 80's Duran Duran.",A View to a Kill
247,rharvey-74630,A View We Didn't Need to See,5,17 May 2019,"Going into this one I really wanted to like it. How could one not be excited about the prospect of Christopher Walken playing a Bond Villain? On that score, I wasn't disappointed. Walken manages to be menancing and campy at the same time. Perhaps only he could pull that off. While Grace Jones is no actress she is a commanding presence and makes for a great henchwoman. What's wrong with this one? To begin, there's way too much campiness and ridiculous slapstick comedy. Tanya Roberts is a terrible actress and makes for a rather annoying Bond Girl. The biggest issue though is that it is clear that the film was written for a younger Bond; and Sir Roger is past his prime. Take away the campiness and insert Timothy Dalton into this film and it's a whole other story. It's too bad Dalton didn't get an earlier start. (Confession: I'm a Dalton fan). The biggest let down is how much the film wasted a decent plot and a great Walken performance.",A View to a Kill
248,blakeboyuk,Very good!!!,8,9 December 2002,"This is a good Bond film, but sadly is the last with Roger as 007. Despite this, A View to a Kill has one of if not the best Bond bad guys ever. Chris Walken is in fine form as the evil Zorin - a psychopathic mega-lo-maniac with his eyes set on computer domination of the world by destroying silicone valley. I found his devilish laughter, especially just before he dies, one of the best moments in the film. Also his horse related exchanges with 007 are swiftly and enjoyable executed. Obviously Moore does it again with a fine portrayal as JB. The scene with the Iceberg, the fight at Miss Suttons house, the fire truck, the race course are particularly enjoyable. Grace Jones is VERY scary as May Day and certainly one of the most unusual Bond girls. Tanya Roberts as Stacey Sutton is fine and does what all Bond girls are supposed to do - say ""oh James"" at the end of the film. With Lois Maxwell and Roger Moore leaving the series its a good swan song for them both. (Also, the title Duran Duran sequence is probably the best of the lot with its colourful 80's imagery and the punchy track from a great band!)",A View to a Kill
249,bigtkeller,Why does everyone Hate this Film?,9,28 January 2007,"What is wrong with everyone? This is a great Bond film. What's not to like; I too am writing this because there are so many bad reviews about this film and I do not understand everyone's reasoning behind it. I also know that Roger Moore was in his late 50's when he did this film, but he still looks like he is in better shape than when Sean Connery did his last Bond film, Diamonds are Forever (not counting Never say Never Again). Sean Connery was just 41 in his last Bond film and he looked like he was getting fat, at least Roger Moore has tried to keep in shape and for being 58 he doesn't look too bad. As for me I think that Sean Connery was a good Bond, but still a little overrated. I do believe Pierce Brosnan, Roger Moore, and even this new guy, Danial Craig, are all better than Sean Connery. Sean Connery has done even better roles than James Bond.Now back to the movie. It has every thing you want in a film. It has one of the better looking Bond girls in the series, memorable villains (Zorin and Mayday), great action sequences (The opening ski chase scene, the fight on the Eiphal Tower, the fire engine chase, and the dual on the Golden gate Bridge), great plot (Zoring trying to destroy Silicon Valley so he can take over the microchip market) and a great original song. Roger Moore still puts out a good performance as Bond, but I feel this time around that Christopher Walken was even better as the villain. All in all a great Bond film, very underrated, probably my favorite Roger Moore film, and probably number five on the whole Bond list (Out of all 21).",A View to a Kill
250,Jonathan_G,The worst Bond film ever made,3,11 June 1999,"How could anyone sit through this awful film?  Bond has become an old man with his pipe and slippers.  Roger Moore should have bowed out gracefully after ""Octopussy"", instead of being party to this appalling mess. He seems to front a succession of stuntmen, and he sleeps with women young enough to be his children.  Tanya Roberts was similarily dreadful in this film: other women are probably offended that women are depicted like her in this film. In some scenes, it looks as though she is out for a walk with her grandfather (Bond) as he's just too old. Christopher Walken should have had more sense than to get involved: his character is completely devoid of all interest.  However, the worst scene of all is the opening sequence:  Grandfather Moore sit on a snowmobile, while a backdrop plays behind him.  Then he goes skiing with the Beach Boy's ""California Girls"". (Awful!).  But what of the scene where the submarine-cum-iceberg opens up, revealing a Union Jack.  The end of this sequence, where Bond tells his girlfriend that they have five days to kill is just plain silly. Patrick MacNee is excellent, but is seen only to briefly.  The film would have been more watchable if he remained in the film for longer.  Finally, the scene with the firetruck chase is disgraceful.  Avoid this film at all costs.",A View to a Kill

Admittedly, Roger Moore was beginning to show his age but who really cares, he still manages to pull it off and make it his own. Moore as Bond is suave and savvy and always gave his all. I have read a a lot of backlash in regards to Christopher Walken's characterization of Max Zorin, some complaining he is too bland and colorless for a Bond movie villain. I feel that Walken has given us a subtle and realistic villain; one who's psychosis is bubbling away under his cold and arrogant exterior and is likely to erupt at any time. This is evident near the climax in the mine shaft sequence and makes his Max Zorin all the more dangerous and deadly.With a 'A View To A Kill', Moore bowed out with a bang not a whimper!Moore Bond Films, as I would rate them:#1 The Spy Who Loved Me'77 #2 A View To A Kill'85 #3 For Your EyesOnly'81 #4 Octopussy'83 #5 Moonraker'79 #6 The Man With The Golden Gun'74 #7 Live and Let Die'73",A View to a Kill

Plus endless factual errors make the whole movie implausible. THE GOOD: An opening ski sequence,wonderfully cheesy opening credits makes the film classic nostalgia.

Oh, and during one part of the teaser, a great song by The Beach Boys is played. The Bond song for this film is exceptional in all aspects of the word. The song is wonderfully song by Duran Duran. As for James Bond himself, he is superbly played by Roger Moore. Some people think that he was too old to play 007 in this film, but I do not agree with them. Sure he was older than the previous Bonds but he wasn't as old as some people said he was. Q has a short but memorable part in this Bond film.

Does it run a bit too long, even by Bond standards? Yes. Does Bond look silly sleeping with butch new-wave singer Grace Jones? Yes. Does Christopher Walken's hair illicit laughs? Of course. Are the Bond girls in 'A View To A Kill' some of the worst ever? Not as bad as the ones following it (minus 'Goldenye'), but yeah, they're pretty uninteresting. 'A View To A Kill' however, is one of the better Roger Moore films, and definitely the most underrated. Siskel & Ebert once called it (unfairly) ""the worst Bond film EVER."" Not the atrocious 'Man With The Golden Gun' or the rather boring 'For Your Eyes Only' (totally OVER-rated), or the universally hated 'Living Daylights', or even Sean Connery's less than stellar attempts at getting his groove back ('Diamonds Are Forever' and 'Never Say Never Again', anyone?).To Mr. Moores credit, he rocks this film to the very last minute...and he's 60 years old, something that (yes, even Him) the 'great' Sean Connery could never do. Being old never looked better, because simply put, Roger Moore doesn't LOOK like he is old; whereas Sir Sean's hair looked like it was always on a holiday as he battled villains at age 50.'A View to a Kill' also has a rocking soundtrack, thanks to Duran Duran's masterful new-wave title song, and John Barry's always incredible music. Not to mention the eye- catching action sequences, that include fights on both the Eiffel Tower (and the subsequent car chase, VERY memorable), and the Golden Gate Bridge. Thanks to these sequences and more, 'View' is guaranteed to be remembered fondly in your memory for years to come.Additionally, Christopher Walken is one of the best villains in the history of Bondage, PERIOD. Whereas the string of Blofelds never lived up to the 'arch-enemy' reputation except for the immortal Donald Pleasence (no offense, but C'MON, Charles 'Rocky Horror' Gray?!? And Telly Savalas was fine, but since when is Blofeld a pimp?), Walken 'chews scenery' with his outlandish wardrobe and hair, owning the character seamlessly, but he always connects with the lines like no one has done since Gert Forbe. He IS Goldfinger, boyish arrogance and all. The makers of 'Casino Royale' should take note when they make the character of Le Chiffre. Bond villains are not SUPPOSED to be humble or wise, but reckless and as immature as all hell . They are 'characters', and because Walken is the best character actor of our time, he is perfect for the series.The movie has its weaknesses: it is overlong, the Bond girls suck, there are too many locations for the senses to handle at one time (a major weakness of ALL Bond films except for Live and Let Die and possibly this one), and Grace Jones is just terrible (have you ever noticed that despite their noble attempts, Bond didn't have an attractive black girlfriend until Halle Berry?), but Christopher Walken saves what might normally be just a mediocre Bond outing and makes it a GREAT one. Enjoyable and entertaining throughout.

I think however, it would have been a better film with some less humor and without Moore's smug smile plastered across his face for 80% of the movie. May Day was underused in the voice department and although Tanya Roberts looked amazing, her scream rattled through me like nothing else. The bit-part bond girl (a former miss world) at the beginning in the iceberg submarine should have had a bigger part, she looked amazing. The action pieces were great especially the golden gate bridge and the eiffel tower and I felt this film had a better look to it than some previous ones.

He looks old (granted he was in his mid 40's when he started as Bond). It's clear that the action scenes are stunt doubles. Moore almost looks tired in the scenes where he's involved. (And if you think about it, Moore is at 30-40 years older than his female co-stars......)Walken makes sense as the villain type. The voice and demeanor lend perfectly to it.

260,ThomasHayden,Moore's farewell is a worthy addition to the Bond series,7,15 September 2005,"Heavily underrated, I think A View to a Kill is a highly enjoyable and very entertaining Bond film. It was Moore's last outing as 007, and, despite being 57 by the time the film was shot, he was able to give a charismatic and witty portrayal as Her Majesty's finest agent. He is as comfortable with the humorous parts of the story as he is with the serious segments. I had a smile on my face all of the time he was at Zorin's palace in France pretending to be an aristocrat interested in horses, with Patrick McNee ( most known for his role in the TV series The Avengers) as his reluctant( and hilarious) servant. Nobody but Roger could deliver lines such as "" May I escort you to the chopper"" ( when he is chattering with Miss Sutton) and make them sound good.As for the serious parts, Bond really shows his aversion towards the villain, instead of smiling and making ingenious remarks. Zorin is to be taken seriously; the result of a genetic experiment by a Nazi doctor, he has grown up to be an extremely intelligent, but unbalanced computer tycoon. Driven by a lust for absolute power, he will stop at nothing to make his evil plans come true...even if they mean killing thousands of people. Christopher Walken delivers an outstanding performance. Zorin is cold-blooded and deathly calm for the most part, manipulating even his girlfriend Mayday, but his mental illness is hinted at in some scenes, such as the shoot-out inside the mine, when he laughs hysterically when killing the disarmed miners.A View to a Kill is also a magnificent action spectacle. The ski chase that opens the film is stunning, but the rest of the movie features equally impressive, well edited action sequences. The real highpoint of the film is the scene where Bond confronts Zorin on the top of the Golden Gate. Though the pace is sometimes slow and the entire KGB subplot simply doesn't make sense, I think the positives clearly overcome the negatives.Bond movies are not meant to be thrillers, they are just escapist entertainment. And in that sense, most of them are excellent.The main concern many people have with A View to a Kill is the fact that it bears a strong resemblance with Goldfinger. There is no denying that the two movies are in similar lines: both are concerned with a leading industrialist who has masterminded a plan which will grant him enormous profit, while at the same time damaging an strategic economic activity( gold has been replaced by microchips this time). In both movies Bond discovers the villain's plan by coincidence. There is a blonde female lead here , too. But it has to be said that every Bond movie borrows heavily from the rest, and the basic structure, style of dialogue and characters have remained (basically) the same for 40 years. There's nothing wrong with that, and it's what Bond fans like me expect from every new Bond outing.Despite the sometimes slow pace, a dull Bond girl( why the heck was Tanya Roberts cast?) and the usual plot holes every Bond movie has, A View to a Kill is a recommended viewing for Bond fans.The perfect way to spend two hours in a Saturday afternoon",A View to a Kill
261,rogermoore,The end of an era,8,23 February 2002,"Although many critics seem to think that A View to a Kill was one of the worst Bond movies, that title doesn't do the film justice. Although, perhaps, it's not one of the best. It was Moore's 7th and final James Bond outing, really, the end of an era. The plot isn't too good, but the actors are. Roger wasn't too old to play Bond, in fact, I think he should have played Bond in The Living Daylights and Licence to Kill (Dalton almost destroyed Bond and himself along with it). Jones and Walken are convincing villains. Surprisingly, for a Moore Bond movie, this film lacks humor and it's a shame that they didn't include the humorous ""Paris Jail Scene"", which is available on DVD. All in all, it's a good movie and a fitting end for Roger Moore",A View to a Kill
262,hoggaglust-1,Plenty of missed opportunities in Moore's final outing,7,16 August 2007,"A View To A Kill - referred to as AVTAK from now on to avoid repetitive strain injury, is a bizarre Bond film to watch. Not necessarily because of Roger's age, as some Moore dissenters will continue to bemoan; (Moore looks in better shape at 58 than a younger Connery did in Never Say Never), but because AVTAK doesn't really 'feel' like a Bond movie. The reasons for this are manifold. Firstly, the locations are sadly lacking... I'm sure Paris and San Francisco are wonderful places, but unfortunately remain ubiquitous and uninspiring locations for film-making, presenting little opportunity for innovative, original or aesthetically pleasing capers and stunts (with the single exception of the Eiffel Tower leap). Hence we have 2 rather pedestrian car chases and a scene with a burning building... wow. Where the film makers try to inject original elements; (eg a car chase in a fire-engine) the obvious restrictions of filming in such environments severely limit the opportunity for more exaggerated, exciting stunts. Where the film makers do have opportunities to inject more adrenalin inducing capers, they miss their chance... For example:1) The Paris car chase could have been far more elaborate and could have easily continued on the river Seine. 2) Another potential car Chase is lost When Pola Ivanova attempts to seduce Bond for information. 3) A fight early in the film is totally lacklustre thanks to Bond's companion being the geriatric Patrick Macnee, and takes place in a very small and not overly convincing packing room. 4) Another fight which takes place in Stacey Sutton's house is again totally devoid of thrills, partially because the setting is devoid of anything to destroy and because a load of heavies simply 'run away' from Bond who is armed with a rock salt loaded shotgun ... (presumably Bond misplaced his Walther PPK whilst cooking quiche the previous evening). All in all, the film is full of missed opportunities and overall lacks the 'ball's and excitement one comes to expect from the franchise. The film isn't 'bad' by any means, it has a more down to earth approach, Christopher Walken's Zorin is about as good a Bond Villain as you could get, even Grace Jones polishes up well as a charismatic side-kick and the story is OK. Whatever you think of Roger Moore's tenure as 007, you can't deny that he at least brought fun to the role. Disappointlingly, AVTAK lacks the colour and vibrancy of Moore's previous outings and is a disappointing swan song to his 12 year reign.",A View to a Kill
263,bluez24,"pretty good ending to the Moore ""Bond"" era",7,7 July 2005,"I remember when this movie came out in fall 1985, when I was 15, and it was widely known that it was to be Roger Moore's last appearance as Bond. I had been a fan of the series so I made sure to see it at the theater. I think it's a good meshing of the Bond series with an ""80s"" feel (microchip story, etc.). I agree that a big plus to the film is Christopher Walken as the villain. Granted, Moore does look a little old to be playing the part, but the film holds up fairly well after 20 years, and it is overall a pretty good ending to the Roger Moore era. I especially liked the scene where Zorin is talking to James Bond and he is reading about Bond on the computer, while they talk about horses (while Bond is acting as the wealthy St. John-Smyth character). I also think that in comparison to the Pierce Brosnan ""Bond"" movies, this one is pretty entertaining. The Brosnan ones relied too much on high budgets, gadgetry (BMW's, etc.), and pure action/explosions. Maybe it is because I grew up with Moore as Bond, but I prefer the 1970s and early 1980s 007 films best. Overall ""A View to a Kill"" is a good send-off of Moore as he retired from the Bond series.",A View to a Kill
264,Equalizer90-1,A View To A Thrill!,10,27 October 2005,"A View To A Kill has to be one of the greatest bond films in the series, possibly the greatest bond film ever. This movie has it all. It has the right bond, the right title, the right cast and the right script. Not that many Bond films get the soundtrack wrong and A View To A Kill certainly continues this trend with a cool 80's anthem. This may have been Rogers' last outing as Bond at a youthful age of 55 years old but in my opinion it was his most memorable appearance as the suave Secret Agent. (Notably because Roger appears to be drunk during most of the movie)The story is simple, maybe not for Bond though. Bond is sent to recover a microchip from a fellow Agent that was killed in action. It is then discovered the microchip belongs to an industrialist tyrant in the form of Max Zorrin (Christopher Walken). Zorrin intends to destroy the microchip supply at Silicone Valley and doesn't care how many people have to die for this objective to be completed. A madman is plotting to take control of the worlds microchip supplies so don't expect Bond to simply sit back and accept it. (That would be an interesting Bond film)Expect the usual mix of British wit, cars, gadgets and girls. A View To A Kill will keep you entertained and on the edge of your seat. OK, that's the boring part of the review completed. This film is absolutely hilarious. The hilarity begins with Roger in a white ski suit and his golden brown tan. It continues with the classic background screen when Roger gets thrown off his Jet Ski. I'm sure that was the best equivalent of CGI back in the 80's. Roger wearing the classic brown sunglasses that also function as x-ray vision - only Roger could pull that off. The crème de la crème of the film, the funniest scene in Bond history has to be where Roger is chasing the mystery assassin from the Eiffel Tower and he jumps on top of a boat but falls right through the roof onto a cake. The dummy that is used in the scene nearly bends in half. Absolutely hilarious.If you don't find this film great considering all the other elements I described, just that one scene with the cake will make up for it. This film is brilliant. Roger is a legend. This is the archetypal Bond film.",A View to a Kill
265,helenaharrison,Licence To A Pension,6,24 June 2001,"'A View To A kill' is the last of Roger Moore's efforts as 007, and it's probably his worst! Everything from the plot, to the casting, leave a lot to be desired. Roger Moore was too old for the role at this point, and the producers should have brought in a newer face. The casting of Tanya Roberts was a mistake as she never looked convincing when coming out with dialogue. The plus points however are the castings of Patrick MacNee and Christopher Walken. MacNee had some humourous moments, and Walken basically is the reason to watch this film. Walken is much younger in this film, and his performance as 'Max Zorin' is menacing throughout. The sets and locations are very nice, and although there are many flaws in this film, there are still some entertaining action sequences (The Eiffel Tower, The Golden Gate Bridge) etc. Overall, one for the easily pleased, and not one for die-hard James Bond fans.",A View to a Kill
266,mambo_man,A Question of Bond as Film or Film as Bond,7,30 November 2002,"There are a number of odd things at play in ""A View To A Kill"".  Is there a Bond film where he actually kills so FEW people?  Does he fire the famous Walther PPK in more than one scene?  Why no gadgets to deploy? Here we see the famous cocksman actually dismissing a sexist comment from a comrade as tasteless and sleeping in a rocking chair rather than with a frightened, half drunk young woman when the opportunity presented itself?
Strange days indeed, Commander Bond.AVTAK is of course, the last outing for Roger Moore as 007 and usually, along with Moonraker, voted the poorest Bond entry.  I myself can't agree - Moonraker may never be rehabilitated, but AVTAK has it's merits as well as it's downsides and those merits are considerable.On the downside - the pre title sequence is pretty ordinary, and thankfully the goofy John Glen trademark cultural incongruity is gotten out of the way right at the beginning.  The girl, Tanya Roberts is utterly lame (*how many times does Bond have to grab her hand and pull her up after she's fallen? And how do her shoes stay on?) And - sacrilege of sacrilege - Christopher Walken is wildly erratic (does all that wiping of his nose he does signify anything?) as the bad guy, although it must be said he appears to actually enjoy his villainous work.The good stuff, though, is the well paced plot (a bit of recycling from Goldfinger here)which sees Bond actually have to do some spy work and make some emotional connections.  The scene where Bond learns of Tibbets murder throws Moore's usually ""lighter"" Bond into sharp and vicious relief. Grace Jones character is interesting and suprisingly noble (although her motivation is a mystery)  The mine flooding scene is one of the most exciting and graphic in the Bond series. There is a terrific soundtrack, Patrick Macnee is as always great fun, Alison Doody has about two scenes and steals them totally - what a lovely looking girl she is/was and the stunts in Paris are excellent.  And one cannot help but notice how much of the ""tone"" of Moore's performance was picked up by Dalton in ""The Living Daylights"".Really, there's a lot of overblown claptrap in the Bond series - the non actor/non personality of Pierce Brosnan ensures that will continue for the (sigh) foreseeable future - but AVTAK is a different, but not unworthy entry in the series that should not be overlooked.",A View to a Kill

270,jbridge-1991,"After a Tired Rehash of Previous Ideas, It Was Roger ""No More""...",5,26 October 2021,"'A View to a Kill' was Roger Moore's final appearance as James Bond, and it sadly was one too many. There were signs of wear and tear in the previous Bond effort 'Octopussy', although that had exotic locations, a suave villain (Louis Jourdan), an enjoyably hammy Stephen Berkoff and one or two good jokes to make it an enjoyable time passer. Moore's last throw at the 007 dice is not so lucky; the plot contains elements of previous better films; a megalomaniac tycoon wanting to dominate a market (Goldfinger, but silicon chips and not gold this time), underwater sub-plots (Thunderball), a pre-title action scene in arctic surroundings (The Spy Who Loved Me), and an elaborate finale in a mysterious locale (You Only Live Twice, and in fact most other Bondian escapades).This would have been more acceptable with a more youthful actor at the helm, but Roger Moore is now clearly too old for the role, as he later admitted. The action scenes themselves come across as more of a forced gimmick that naturally occurring within the plot, and it is very obvious they are performed by various stuntmen as director John Glen seems to have added this as a visual metaphor on Moore's advancing years. Younger stuntmen should also have been employed with Rog getting it on with no less than four young women during the film's running time, with no amount of lighting, make-up and hairstyling able to disguise he is very clearly far too long in the tooth for such girl-chasing.The film would've been far better employed at making allusions to Moore's age, but with all the expensive stunts, close shaves and running about, it comes across as embarrassing and unintentionally amusing, and not a self deprecating parody as it could have been with Moore who could have handled as such with some style; when the film tries for humour, the quips are weak, and the jokes are facetious, if not bathetic, particularly at the beginning when ""California Girls"" is employed on the soundtrack during the snow-based chase.The main villain, Max Zorin (Christopher Walken), is bland, and the prominent Bond girl, Stacey Sutton, is dully and feebly played by Tanya Roberts, although Grace Jones is actually not as bad as you think as Zorin's main henchwoman and mistress May Day, with a fairly effective change of heart towards the film's end as she becomes a ally of Bond, and Patrick Macnee is very endearing as a partner of Bond before he leaves the scene far too early. Macnee and Moore of course were major TV icons of the 60's as John Steed and Simon Templar, and their easy-going chemistry provide the film with its best moments, despite the uninspired script and plot that surrounds them.One would have hoped Roger Moore could have departed the James Bond franchise with respect and dignity with 'A View to a Kill', as it is, the film works only sporadically, lacking wit and self deprecation that Moore could have easily brought on board for an apt farewell, the expensive but generic action and non-exotic locations, plus an overage star, making this a regrettable misfire and not a triumphant coda to his stint as 007.Rating: 5 out of 10.",A View to a Kill

272,get2way,Not that bad.....,5,5 January 2003,"This is not as bad as most people say it is as it is a better bond film then Live and Let Die and Diamonds are Forever. This films starts off with a great arctic ski chase with many explosions and gunshots with is the standard for the series. Heck, there is even snowboarding with the Beach Boys. The theme music is the best of all the bond films. People should give Duran Duran credit for the job they did. There is a chase through Paris that is also very cool to watch even though you can clearly see that it's a stuntman and not Sir Roger driving the car. The film doesn't pick up the action again until Bond goes to San Fransisco, where there is a firetruck chase, mine shaft explosions, and the finale on top of the golden gate bridge.This is a good farewell to the Roger Moore Bond, and this movie is certainly better the failed comedy Moonraker. Tanya Roberts sucks it up as a Bond girl, but she is so stupid that I tend to laugh at her when she starts whining. I think that young people can respect a film for being entertaining even if there acting is not great by one person. I think that most of the Connery Bonds are dated and not as fun to watch as the late 80's and 90's bond films. This film was the first film to be primarily made just for younger people, and thats why teenagers liked it more than those that grew up with Connery in the 60's and 70's. Face it, movies are commonly made for teenagers nowadays so maybe this movie started the trend.A View to a Kill is a good movie with a somewhat confusing plot that is like Goldfinger, but if you watch it a couple of times you should appreciate it.

Roger Moore is very old, he's got very artificial color of hair, probably to hide his hoarfrost. Apart from that he acts fine, just like Christopher Walken. The last scene is fantastic and in my opinion it is some kind of legendary Bond scene, just like Bond's fight against Scaramanga (The Man with...) or the moment in the casino (Dr No) when we see Sean Connery's face for the first time.

Grace Jones was another poor choice as well since she had no place in any Bond movie. Bond movies are notoriously famous for beautiful ladies & Jones is ugly as sin. Walken was another bad choice & performed extremely poorly. The script was junk & a supposed 007 agent got so easily taken in & subdued & captured.

Some exellent acting performances by Christopher Walken, Roger Moore, Patrick Macnee, and Grace Jones. Oscar winning actor Christopher Walken who plays Max Zorin with a laid back calm attitude that makes his character seem absolutly nuts. For example at one point when Zorin is shooting some miners he chuclkes non chalantly like its no big deal that he killing all these innocent people. Roger Moore is exellent as 007 as he controls the amount of cheesy one liners he makes and concentrates on being more serious. Since Roger Moore made less wisecracks this gave room for Patrick Macnee to bring a fine touch of humor to the film as he portrays Sir Godfrey Tibbett Bonds sidekick with a touch of humor that makes Godfrey a likable character. Grace Jones plays May Day the strange and mysterious sidekick of Max Zorin. Grace Jones plays May Day in a mysterious matter that makes her character intriguing. The music is also very good and adds to the suspense. The story is original as it brings Bond into the computer age.

By the end of his run as 007, Connery was clearly in it for the money, with so/so films like 'You Only Live Twice', 'Diamonds Are Forever', and then the unspeakably bad 'Never Say Never Again' later in his career. What set Roger Moore apart was the fact that he seemed to continuously play 007 for the love of the character and of the series, he was in many ways the 'True Bond'. But that somewhat changed in 1985 when 'A View To A Kill' was released.In many ways, 'AVTAK' was not Moore's fault, in fact the movie had a few things going for it, the villain, Max Zorin (Christopher Walken) was smart and intriguing, the plot was in a few ways realistic, and the locations, even though there were just 2, were good. The reason this film did not work was mainly because of Moore's age. Most of us thought he was too old to be playing Bond in 'Octopussy' but by the time 'AVTAK' rolled around he seemed to have been spent. Moore was leathery, old, tired, and didn't move with the finesse we were all used to, basically he should have retired years ago. The unfortunate thing is that no matter how good Moore did in the film he was old and no one could see past that.

It's entertaining, the story is fresh and creative, and the characters are well-cast.  Firstly, Roger Moore, who was 57 at the time, was NOT too old to play 007 in this film. Can we really define ""too old"" when actors that are in their 50's such as Harrison Ford, Arnold Schwarzenegger, and Sylvester Stallone regularly star in action films today.  If Indiana Jones 4 and Terminator 3 both came out tomorrow, most of us would rush to buy tickets, thinking little about the fact that Ford and Schwarzenegger might be ""a little old"".  I think that Christopher Walken played an excellent villain.  His character, Max Zorin has it all: creepiness, unpredictability, and an appetite for death and conquest.  Some people are shocked about the segment in the mine scene when Zorin takes out a bunch of his workers with an Uzi.  To those people I say, ""Hello!  Max Zorin was psychotic!  This scene was an excellent demonstration of his sick mind.  Had you been paying attention to the movie you'd know that!""  The bottom line is that the cast is great and the story makes perfect sense(more than I can say for The Living Daylights, which is somehow rated higher on this site).  In light of this, I don't see how anyone could hold it with such contempt.  In a way, A View to a Kill is like the New Coke which was introduced around the same time.

It leads right into Duran Durans now classic title song that can still be heard on 80s radio stations today. Bond is paired up with ex-Avenger Patrick Macnee who lives it up as Tibbett. They infiltrate the mysterious industrialist Max Zorin's(played with zest by Oscar winner Christopher Walken) chantilly mansion to see why his chemically induced horses keep winning. Once their, Bond meets future Indiana Jones villain Jenny Flex(the gorgeous Allison Doody) and not to mention Zorins butt kicking accomplice MayDay(She-Woman Grace Jones).  Bond has his usual first meeting with the Bond girl, Stacey Sutton,(played by stunning Charlie's Angels Tanya Roberts) which in this case turns out for the worst, has a small bed fling with MayDay and Tibbett unfortunately gets washed out. Bond soon escapes and makes it back to the states where he does a little scuba diving into Zorins intake pipes where he meets up with KGB agent Pola Ivanova with whom he had a relationship with years before. Afterwards, Bond soon encounters Stacey and they soon ally with one another to bring Zorin and his San Francisco earthquake project down once and for all.

Roger Moore soon retires at the end but not before ""cleaning up a few details"" with Roberts.The film was the first Bond film I saw way back in late 1985 on video at the age of 4.

The Best 007 soundtrack of them all!Roger Moore get his hats off to me as being the great James Bond next to Connery.Christopher Walken is totally suave and cool as the blonde villain with that snickering sneer and relaxed motive of taking over the world in high style.

283,ritalan,The last was the best,10,22 July 2004,"I think the moore 007 movies, generally speaking, got better as time went on. For example, the 2 worst Moore 007's were Man with the Golden gun (2nd worst Moore 007) followed closely by Moore's debut as 007 in Live and Let Die. Spy who loved me saved possibly the entire 007 series. Then it regressed a little bit again with Moonraker and especially For Your Eyes only (which to me was the worst moore 007). But then a great one with Octopussy with Khamal Khan and then this awesome film, AVTAK.The reasons this is the best are many. Best theme song, most action scenes (the eiffel tower, the horse chase, the blimp scene, the city hall elevator scene, the scene in the mine, and so many others). I guess my main reason for considering this one the best is Zorin. The villain is always obviously a main character in any bond film, I don't care who plays 007. In this one, Zorin was by far the most evil and psychotic villain. And I think Mayday was very good as his henchman (or henchwoman in this case- anybody think she couldn't kick knick nack's but??). Just who was the henchman in for your eyes only, by the way? Sure this movie didn't deal with global destruction, but millions dying in California is nothing to sneeze at either. Nobody really was going to die in Goldfinger, he was just going to have a monopoly on gold, yet everyone seems to rave about that one.And the them song by Duran Duran simply kicks but. It's a different genre of theme song from say FYEO or TSWLM, but even so, overall, it really is the best theme song. I dare say it was the only one to hit #1 on the charts.Best Moore 007 films are 1) AVTAK 2) Octopussy 3) SPy who loved me....after that it really doesn't matter since the rest are all mediocre at best.",A View to a Kill

Great actors, everybody! Such a surprise, Grace Jones; great acting with the charming Tanya Roberts and one of the best rivals, Christopher Walken.
One of the best musics with the main score by Duran Duran which was the only one in Bond scores, to be so top in US and UK charts.

Poor old Roger Moore (For whom I have a great affection) looks as decrepit as Q with what looks like some desperate plastic surgery to foil the ageing process. His face is pinched and even more immobile than usual and his wooing of the female lead (Tanya Roberts in a thankless role) looks at best like a dirty old man's fantasy and at worst like paedophilia. What's missing is a true sense of danger and menace, an engaging plot, a truly memorable villain and some joyful stunts. What we get is a redundant plot, madman Christopher Walken, (worst ever performance) is the psychotic product of a Nazi doctor's experiments, and wants to flood Silicon Valley for reasons best known to him. The pacing is dire (continental drift moves quicker!!) and the special effects embarrassingly bad. The back projection on top of the Golden gate bridge is so awful and studio bound it takes away the very tingle we are supposed to be experiencing. We have seen the traducing of a charming humorous killer of the Sean Connery era to this sad almost self-loathing parody. All this is supported (if that's not too strong a word) by some of the weakest bit players around. Grace Jones, Patrick Macnee, Patrick Bauchau, must all have been desperate for the money.

I agree though about the stacey sutton thing. She just whines and screeches at the top of her lungs and she isn't convincing. I thought it was funny though how she got fired and came out looking really shocked. HAHA. Despite that this film has some excellent advantages. Like the villians, Zorin and May Day. They were both good choices. But i didn't like how May Day suddenly went to Bond's side after he flooded the place. That kind of wrecked her character after that. AVTAK also has some outstanding action sequences, like the Eiffel tower thing, the golden gate bridge, and the fire truck chase. There was a deleted scene which was really funny where Bond is coming out of the Paris police station and getting his gadgets back. I thought they should have kept it in the movie.

Roger Moore, as Bond was 57 when this was made in 1985! He looks far too old for the part especially in some of the action sequences. These include a snowboarding chase in the old Soviet Union in the pre-credits sequence and atop the Golden Gate Bridge in San Francisco in the finale. Moore also looks embarrassing in the romantic sequences opposite the athletic 'May Day' played by Grace Jones. The film also marked the final appearance of Lois Maxwell as M's long serving secretary Miss. Moneypenny. The title song performed by Duran Duran is an improvement on All Time High from Octopussy and was one of the highest charting Bond themes. Today it is still occasionally played on jukeboxes and radio stations. Christopher Walken again shows his excellent acting capabilities as the villain Max Zorin, yet he can't control the remainder including the annoying screams and yells of Stacey Sutton as the Bond girl played by Tanya Roberts. San Francisco is a prominent location. Note how many times Stacey yells 'James, help me!' At this time and after seven Roger Moore Bond films the series was looking tired and in need of some fresh acting talent. That came in the following Bond adventure 2 years later, The Living Daylights with Timothy Dalton taking over as James Bond 007. Out of interest, note the iceberg submarine vehicle Bond uses to escape from the Soviets in the Arctic Circle at the beginning of the movie.

What makes this one so fun is watching Roger having difficulty doing routine action scenes. At 58 years old, you would be stiff too. I have never seen so many stunt doubles in one show. And when he kisses the younger women it looks like someone's grandfather getting it on with a teenager. The movie itself was good let alone Roger's age. What I can't understand is why the show's producer's kept him in that long.(and If you think Roger looks old, you should see Miss Moneypenny, man!) Moonraker(1979) was in all good standing, Roger's last performance. As with most Bond films, there is plenty of action in this one. Q still looks the same as he has since the early days, but then again, he has that appearance of an aging character. The movie is fun to watch for all the apparent reasons.

It's not quite as good as some of the 1960's classics, and Tanya Roberts is simply awful as the heroine, but Roger Moore is always a treat to watch, and Christopher Walken is solid, if a bit low-key. Some of the scenes in France drag on (the ""horse steroids"" subplot is tangential to the main story about microchips), but A View to a Kill is still more intelligent than the mindless, over-the-top-action-over-storyline Bonds of the Pierce Brosnan era.

A race with a fire-engine and police-cars over the hills of San Fransisco, a flooding silver-mine, and, finally, a fight between 007 and the villain atop the Golden Gate Bridge!

While the central theme of the film is very similar to Goldfinger, it fails to rise to the heights of that masterpiece. WHile Moore acts with his usual vigour and aplomb, Tanya Robers is downright awful with her screaming ""James"" every few minutes. Mayday is better than her of course. Christopher Walken is good as the villain Zorin. Though the film starts out with a good action sequence, subsequently, there is little action in the film.

Christopher Walken plays an excellent part as the psychotic Max Zorin, an insane industrialist bent on destroying Silicon Valley. Grace Jones plays his sidekick, May Day, a good, if sometimes a little over-the-top henchwoman. There a plethora of Bond girls in this installment, and the main one is played by Tonya Roberts, who plays a geologist that isn't particularly fond of Zorin.Above all, A View to a Kill is a good addition to the Bond series and a good exit for Roger Moore.

This was a great story line, especially in the 1980's when computers were becoming cool.Tonya Roberts, In my humble opinion was probably the most beautiful Bond girl there was. Her sexy throaty whisper was intoxicating. May Day (Walken's strange and muscular girlfriend) added so much too the story, especially what she did at the end.Despite what people say about this being one of the worst 007 movies, it had a solid story.

I actually think this is one of Roger's better films.2). One of the worst bond films of all time - Lot's of comments refer to this movie as being Roger's worst and possibly one of the worst Bond movies of all time. For me the movie has all the essential bond elements a sexy bond girl, a great theme song, terrific bad guy (Christopher Walken) and Roger on top form.

Perhaps they learned from this one to make the infinitely superior follow-up 'Octopussy'.Grace Jones is one of the sharpest evil henchwomen in the whole of the Eon collection. Unfortunately Tanya Roberts is one of the blandest of all the Bond girls. It's not entirely the actresses fault, either. Her part is written bland and helpless.There's an unfortunate tendency to go for broad comedy rather than sly wit. It's one thing having Sean Connery slip the corpse of a woman into a chair and say that she's 'just dead', quite another to hang Roger Moore from the ladder of a speeding fire truck, like something out of a Harold Lloyd movie. The sequence in the opening scenes where Bond snowboards to the tune of 'California Girls' is pitiful.And why on earth, when Bond escapes in a submarine camouflaged as an iceberg at the end of the same pre-title sequence, does it have to be such a dirty grey.

305,fuddrucker,"Mr. Bond, what a lovely daughter you have!",5,13 February 2002,"This film, while still mildly entertaining in classic 007 tradition, is definitely a contender for the James Bond bargain bin. The plot (something to do with microchips and flooding Silicon Valley) is never properly explained and is frankly very boring. Roger Moore is obviously far too old to be playing Bond here, Octopussy should have been his sign-off (especially as it is a much better film.) Moore was born in 1927, this film was 1985, making him 58. Hardly the age of a believable dashing secret agent who can bed any woman he wants. That pretty much nullifies the film from the start.Tanya Roberts is young enough to be Moore's daughter. Roberts herself is spectacularly awful, spending way too much time shrieking ""James!"" and looking stupid. Grace Jones as May Day is so masculine it's impossible to find her attractive, therefore any screen time involving her is quite unpleasant, particularly the scene where Bond beds her. Ouch. But perhaps most annoying of all is the overlong, totally boring and seemingly pointless first third of the film set at Zorin's stables. What the hell did all those horses and steroids have to do with the Silicon Valley plot?
'A View to a Kill' seems to have become a completely different movie by the fire engine scene, which looks like it came right out of a 'Cannonball Run' movie. This scene even recalls traces of the shockingly bad 'J.W. Pepper' character with the obligatory fat police chief frustrated with Bond's wacky antics. The film's climax on the bridge is completely lacklustre, Zorin and Bond grappling about before Zorin simply falls to a disappointing end.
The film's good points: The classic title track by Duran Duran. Max Zorin - although Walken was panned in this role, I find his genuinely psychotic character believable and a joy to watch. It's just a pity he didn't have a better script and plot to play with. I love the scene in Main Strike mine in particular. Many critics have said that Zorin flipping out and machine gunning everyone is a case of overkill and maybe it is, but damn it's fun. And in this film, that's a rare thing.",A View to a Kill

The only other good part of the movie is where Max Zorin(Christopher Walken) burns the city hall of San Francisco and 007 saves Stacey (Tanya Roberts) and is on the firetruck through San Francisco.If you want to start watching 007 films, I would not recommend this one to be the first that you watch. I recommend Dr. No, Goldfinger, Thunderball, On Her Majesty's Secret Service, Diamonds are Forever, The Spy Who Loved Me, Moonraker, For Your Eyes Only, Octopussy, Goldeneye, The World is Not Enough.

Seems Boy from Brazil Max Zorin (Christopher Walken)has some kind of evil plan involving horses and microchips and chronic mispronunciation of the word schedule. Bond ends up paired with the wooden Tanya Roberts...It seems useless to comment upon her character, as there really is no character at all, simply script and a (disputable) pretty face. And then there is May Day (Grace Jones), who can only be describe as frightening. She may be some kind of android, and that look...I am certain Mike Score was involved in some way.
