0,kosmasp,Fresh air,8,17 May 2021,"If you are claustrophobic it may be a good idea not to watch this. If you like movies that do a lot with very little (at least seemingly little), you will be entertained. Aja does another movie that is in a tight place .. even tighter than the last one he did with the crocodiles (or is alligators? I always mix those up).Amazing performance by the lead actress. Say what you want about him or his films, but he really knows how to do psychological horror ... this is well thought of and makes sense overall if you take the Science Fiction parts into account. We're not anywhere near freezing people for their safety ... for whatever reasons.The guessing game is there and you may like where this heads or be appalled/annoyed by it. I dug what this did - another good Aja then.",Oxygen
1,Tweekums,Good claustrophobic sci-fi,8,19 May 2021,"As this film opens a woman wakes in an airtight medical cryogenic chamber. She has no idea who she is or how she got there... or even where 'there' is. The unit is controlled by an artificial intelligence called MILO; this informs her that due to an unspecified problem she is rapidly running out of oxygen. If she is to survive she will have to recover enough of her memories to learn about the situation she is in... and avoid some of MILO's attempts to make her little remaining time more comfortable.Going into this film I'd say the less you know the better; there are some good twists and it is best one learns facts at the same time as our protagonist. The film is, apart from a few brief flashbacks, set almost entirely within the cramped pod; this gives an impressively claustrophobic feel to proceedings. The more we learn the greater the sense of hopelessness. Mélanie Laurent does a really fine job as our protagonist; you can feel both her anguish, fear and occasional optimism as situations change. The inside of the pod is well designed; large enough for some movement but not enough for full movement. Overall a solid film for sci-fi fans who don't demand lots of action.These comments are based on watching the film in French with English subtitles.",Oxygen
2,searchanddestroy-1,Buried in Gravity,7,13 May 2021,"Both movies above may have influenced this science fiction film, not my taste but worth seeing for those in search of this kind of feature. It is more than predictable but Melani Laurent is awesome in this film. The oxygene issue in space has already been evoked on netflix platform a few weeks ago in STONAWAY. Is it a coincidence? I won't say more,because I repeat, this stuff is not my taste. But I have seen worse as time waster, though a bit slow...",Oxygen
3,851222,Good science fiction movie,8,15 June 2021,"Greetings from Lithuania.""Oxygen"" (2021) reminded me heavy ""Buried (2010). Reminded me because of the premise, and liked ""Buried"" more because it kept things more simple. ""Oxygen"", without any spoiler goes way deeper, yet sometimes less is better.Anyway, back to ""Oxygen"". This was a very good movie. Acting was tour de force of Mélanie Laurent. Directing, as usually, was very solid by Alexandre Aja whose movies i always enjoy very much, because he takes these kinda simple premises, and pushes them further but never to much and its always is entertaining, never boring and extremely well paced (""Crawl"" (2019); The Hills Have Eyes (2006)).Overall, the less you know about the premise of ""Oxygen"" the more rewarding experience will be. Sufficient to say its a science fiction movie, so you better be prepared. Very solid sci-fi movie.",Oxygen

5,Thanos_Alfie,Interesting...,6,29 October 2021,"""Oxygen"" is a Drama - Sci-Fi movie in which we watch a woman waking up in a cryogenic chamber without remembering anything from her life or even who she is. She has to remember fast because her oxygen level is dropping rapidly and there is not much time.Despite the simple plot of the movie, it was very interesting and it had much of suspense through its whole duration. The direction which was made by Alexandre Aja was very good and he presented very well the whole concept of the movie and the main idea behind his main character. In addition to this, the interpretation of Mélanie Laurent who played as Elizabeth 'Liz' Hansen was simply amazing and she made the difference. The selection of Mathieu Amalric as voice of M. I. L. O. was an excellent choice and fitted very well. All in all, I have to say that ""Oxygen"" is an interesting Sci-Fi movie and I highly recommend everyone to watch it.",Oxygen
6,cruise01,Sci fi thriller that suspends the audience into a claustrophobic fear.,6,1 June 2021,3 out of 5 stars.Oxygen is a fair science fiction thriller film about Liz (Melanie Laurent) who wakes up in a cryo pod with no memory. No idea how she got there. And a defective pod that is limited on oxygen. While she tries to discover how she got there. And how she can escape it.What worked? The plot is decent which tried to keep a mystery. It gives a brief backstory on Liz. And some brief moments of the events that is happening before she got in the pod. There is a twist which was pretty neat. And shocking.Melanie Laurent did a good job with her performance.The music score was okay. Its claustrophobic direction was good.What did not work?The film was short with where it went. Spending the whole movie in a cryo pod. Which did get boring after a while. And it did get slow which was being short on thrills.,Oxygen
7,eddie_baggins,An above average Netflix offering,6,11 June 2021,"Making a name for himself in the horror field with the likes of High Tension, The Hills Have Eyes, Piranha 3D and Crawl, French director Alexandre Aja takes a different route with his newest outing Oxygen, with this Netflix acquired claustrophobic thriller a more dialed back affair for the boundary pushing director who even showcases a much softer side to himself than his shown previously.Taking the Buried/Devil approach to proceedings as we spend Oxygen's 100 minute runtime confined to a life supporting medical pod with Melanie Laurent's Liz, who has awoken with no memories of who she is or how she came to be stuck in the pod with a quickly dwindling supply of air, Aja's well-filmed ride may not always be the pulse-pounding thriller it wants to be but thanks to some inventive directing and a committed leading lady, this sweat inducing ride will keep you engaged throughout.Starting off relatively slowly, with us and Liz trying to figure things out and wondering why we should care for her plight to survive with nothing more than an A. I computer known as MILO to help her, Oxygen does start to ramp things up around the half way mark with more knowledge about what is going on and how Liz came to be found in such a predicament helping the film out in a big way as we all of a sudden start to ride every bump and fall with Liz as her oxygen dwindles and her quest to survive feels more pressing with every passing second.With strong visuals (and a scene that will go down as one of the years best as we catch a glimpse of Liz's external surrounds), a great score by Robin Coudert and some neat little horror throwbacks from its director, Oxygen feels like a polished and professional offering and a level above other similar Netflix released offerings, ensuring that its high concept idea is bought to life in a strong and satisfying way.It's not too say the film is able to reach the highs of some of its other similar counterparts, there are numerous moments where the film feels bogged down by repetitive situations and stretches of unengaging scenarios but despite not being able to reach grand heights, Oxygen is a thriller worth checking out and a nice example of Alexandre Aja trying his hand at something a little different from his usual staple.Final Say -Ramping up in its latter stages and featuring a great central turn from its leading lady, Oxygen is a solid thriller that might not grip you through its entirety but has enough solid moments to make it worth your time.3 lab rats out of 5.",Oxygen
8,matthewssilverhammer,A great-looking indie-scifi that surprises at every turn.,8,11 July 2021,"For whatever reason, I came into this pretty cynically, thinking it was just a weak Netflix film that would lean too heavily on its gimmicky premise (woman wakes up with complete amnesia inside a cryogenic chamber). Instead, Oxygen's relentless, well-constructed plotting and Laurent's performance steadily and assuredly won me over. Even the familiar philosophical trappings (what makes reality reality?) is so sincere and potent it feels fresh in the moment.",Oxygen
9,RosanaBotafogo,Good...,8,21 May 2021,"Claustrophobic... It reminded me of the wonderful ""Buried Alive"", a modern, utopian, technological and less dramatic version, perhaps due to excessive modernization we do not have enough empathy, as it was in ""Buried"" ...

But it is still distressing, compenetrante, especially the second half where science fiction and drama externalize more intensely...",Oxygen
10,jtindahouse,Aja makes it work,7,16 June 2021,"I have mixed feelings about someone as talented as Alexandra Aja making a film like 'Oxygen' which is set entirely in a cryogenic chamber. On the one hand, without his class at the helm this film may not have worked at all. On the other, I would love to see someone with his talents taking on more ambitious projects that require more versatility in film-making. This could have been the ideal project for a young up and comer (and they could just as easily have made a meal of it to be fair).As mentioned, for a film set entirely in a cryogenic chamber this film works astonishing well. At first we are presented with a real feeling of claustrophobia. Then as the film goes on we are panicked about out lead character running out of time/oxygen. The film does an excellent job of putting us in the lead character's shoes.I watched this on Netflix with an audio dub and I have to say it was very well done. I've seen some shockers over the years, but this one was easy to forget it was a dub. Very impressive.The one thing that didn't really work for me in this film was the emotional connection the film tries to establish between the lead character and another character. It just fell flat, and unfortunately that was what the film was basing everything around ultimately. The film does also suffer lightly from some pacing issues. All up though I did have a decent time with this film. It doesn't quite fall into must-see material, however you're likely going to have a decent time if you do give it a go.",Oxygen
11,yusufpiskin,Alexandre Aja,8,12 May 2021,"""Buried Alive"" meets ""Solaris""I throughourly enjoyed this film. Despite some people saying it was predictable at points, which I can see that now, I went it to it with no expectations.It started for me as it implied, someone stuck in a chamber, perhaps in a hospital, or maybe kidnapped. Then we learn that this is actually a spaceship destined for a new planet. THEN we continue to find near the end that our character and everyone on board is not even real, but clones of the doomed on Earth.This movie is sometimes terrifying in the hopelessness and anticipation for death, with many attempts at survival falling short, until we get a satisfying ending for the future.I think for the right people, it did what it wanted to do and was surprising, and even if you saw it coming, I think it was still filmed and told exceptionally.",Oxygen
12,Pairic,Boxed In,8,21 May 2021,"Oxygen: A French SciFi movie with a new take on the fear of being buried alive. Instead of waking in a coffin a woman (Mélanie Laurent) comes to in a medical cryogenic chamber. The AI monitoring the unit, MILO, tells her that she has just two hours of oxygen left but won't unseal the pod. Communication with the outside world is patchy and communication is often cut off. To make matters worse the woman is suffering from memory ls but with flashbacks suspects she has been put in the capsule maliciously. A tale of claustrophobic terror with hopes of rescue rising only to be dashed again. She has to battle not only her own panic but also the other enemy within- the AI which, helpfully, wishes to sedate or even euthanise her. The tension is maintained but you may solve at least part of the mystery about whats really going on. Nevertheless there are are a few interesting plot twists with good effects and a great performance by Laurent. Directed by Alexandre Aja and written by Christie LeBlanc. On Netflix. 8/10.",Oxygen

14,ulicknormanowen,Where am I ? Who am I ?,7,13 May 2021,"Sci-fi is extremely rare in French cinema ,but Netflix lent a helping hand and presto ! An estimable work well acted by reliable Mélanie Laurent.Mélanie's fate,in the first part of the movie , may remind you of Ryan Reynolds' in the excellent ""buried ""(2010); what does it matter if Reynolds is buried alive in a coffin by a group of Irakis and if Laurent is locked up inside a cryogenic chamber with the highest technology? ;both try to communicate with the outside world , both are more and more anxious because their oxygen is running out ; and voices they get tell them to take it easy ,but actually makes them more terrified by the horrible fate which lies in store for them. Ryan 's got only a mobile phone ,Laurent has plenty of paraphernalia around her,but most of the time,it backfires against her : ""the charitable euthanasia"" trick almost verges on black humor .There's an unexpected twist halfway through which explains why the heroine is stuck in her chamber,followed by awesome pictures which pack a real wallop .The second part is not as gripping as the first one ,and there is a certain blandness infiltrates the story .But it's so rare to see French actors in sci-fi (too bad that Malik Zidi 's part is so small) that it's cause for celebration.",Oxygen

16,I_Ailurophile,"A thrilling, fulfilling surprise",10,3 June 2021,"Whatever the genre, films that play with a tightly confined setting give themselves a unique challenge. How does one create a compelling narrative when the action doesn't stray beyond a very limited space? It's certainly possible, but every time someone tries, it's interesting just to see how the results turn out.Excepting establishing shots, 'Oxygen' never meaningfully leaves the confines of the cryogenic pod that the protagonist finds herself in. Instead it broadens its horizons by demonstrating how very advanced this piece of technology is. Once she awakens, the protagonist is able to interact with the pod through its computer system (voiced by Mathieu Amalric), and thereby expand the options for determining her status. We also get flashbacks that slowly piece together the story, and information trickles into the narrative to give us the whole picture.I had very mixed expectations when I began watching, and for some time I remained uncertain. But just as the grand vision unfolded bit by bit, I gradually grew to appreciate it ever more. Color me surprised: I love 'Oxygen.'This is nothing if not a very exclusive vehicle for Mélanie Laurent. She has proven herself in other features, but what greater challenge is there for an actor than a film that is a essentially a one-woman show? The emotions are palpable as she expresses very relatable alarm, terror, desperation, despair, and resolve. Laurent has a way of conveying so much through only her voice, or her expressions, that marks her as a true world-class performer. It's a joy to watch her in this.I'm blown away that 'Oxygen' apparently marks the first feature film for Christie LeBlanc as a writer. While the picture that unfolds squarely occupies the sci-fi genre, the narrative thrust is decidedly experimental in the grand scheme of cinema, with so few other films attempting such a bent. This screenplay was bold as an endeavor, and its production no less so. Netflix took a chance on distributing this film - and I'm so glad they did. I truly hope we get to see many more writing credits for LeBlanc, because if 'Oxygen' is any indication of her capabilities, we can surely expect many great things from her.Kudos to director Alexandre Aja, too, who even within the small space of the cryogenic pod manages to pick up every detail of the surroundings, and every nuance of Laurent's swell performance. A film like this wouldn't be possible without a keen eye behind the camera, and Aja has demonstrated himself very well. The production design is phenomenal, with the craft of the cryogenic pod representing a vivid imagination of future technology. The visual effects, including some essential establishing shots, are outstanding, every bit as worthy as other aspects of the feature. And I am very impressed, also, with the original score of Robin Coudert, aka ROB. He deftly captures the shifting tone throughout 'Oxygen' with sweeping themes that are as much a treat for our ears as the visuals, including Laurent's performance, are for our eyes.The story that comes together, both inside and beyond the pod, is not just thrilling, but unexpectedly harrowing. As a viewer it's hard to believe that there could be particularly profound twists in a plot that's so spatially confined, but LeBlanc fools us repeatedly with a course of events that is absolutely riveting. And the background to the active plot, revealed over time, is no less engrossing. All things told, this may not be a movie for audience members that are especially squeamish, or who find current events - any current events, really - to be too traumatic to realize on film. Yet that screenwriter LeBlanc, director Aja, and star Laurent are able to conjure a feature this captivating, that encompasses and accomplishes so much from a pointedly singular setting, is a rather great achievement, I think.In terms strictly of content I don't know that I would say 'Oxygen' is a perfect film, no matter how highly I regard it. On the other hand, the sheer audacity to tell this story, emphasizing an unconventional and limited setting, definitely sets it apart, as does the sheer quality of all its composite parts. For the simple excellence of its build as a work of cinema, I adore 'Oxygen' more than I can easily express, and it gets my top recommendation.",Oxygen

At the end of this movie you have to make an opinion by yourself. The story hits exactly in the current pandemic time the problem but let you surprise watching Oxygen.

19,arungeorge13,Alexandre Aja's second tryst with sci-fi is only partially engaging! [+51%],5,15 May 2021,"What drew me to Oxygen was its director Alexandre Aja. His films have always intrigued me, if not, left me entertained. While horror seems like his mainstay, it is interesting to see the guy play around other genres lately. Oxygen is his second sci-fi outing (the first being ""Furia""). To call Oxygen a thriller would be a bit of a stretch actually, and that's a shame given its core plot and premise. Melanie Laurent plays a woman named Liz who wakes up in a cryogenic pod with no recollection of how she ended up there. It's an open-ended premise, with numerous possibilities. The setup is minimalistic, and it's Laurent's immediate surroundings (needles, tubes, and electrodes) within the pod that we see for most of the film.As a sci-fi drama with mysterious layers, Oxygen is worth a watch. There are twisty revelations aplenty (some work, some don't); there's a subplot surrounding Liz's memories about her husband that focuses on the emotional angles, while the desperate need to avert the low oxygen situation takes centre stage. The issue here is that the latter (i.e. The major plot device) feels less intense and tension-inducing when compared with the 'who am I?' or 'why am I here?' subplots. Since the film almost entirely takes place within the pod, every twist (including the climactic one) is relegated to Liz communicating the right set of instructions to the system's AI at the right moment.I didn't particularly enjoy those fleeting moments of horror that Aja tucks into the flick using lab rats. The claustrophobia did kick in to some extent, and I kept mentally communicating with Liz to not waste oxygen by acting all panicky. The film also uses memories as a device to drive the story forward, which comes across as a bit of an overkill. All that said, Laurent's emotive face, being the film's one-and-only focus, is the saving grace. With cleverly packed tension and a shorter runtime, Oxygen really could have been something.",Oxygen

21,gianmarcoronconi,Boring,4,20 July 2021,This film manages well to give anxiety to the viewer even if it is very slow and without much sense accomplished to exist.

22,gedikreverdi,A claustrophobic thriller with a few logical issues,6,27 July 2021,"She was one of the clones that's being sent to the new planet of humans along with many other clones. His original human was an elderly scientist. I felt the same as I watched Moon as they have some false memories that they never lived. The first 30 minutes were really claustrophobic and it became better as she spoke to MILO and made phone calls to the earth. I somehow knew she was in space. She got back to hyper sleep with the oxygen reserves of other failed capsules. The moment where she saw what's on the other side of the window was really creepy with those floating faceless dead bodies and numerous other capsules attached to each other as a part of a gigantic space ship. The last scene was the clone couple was hugging each other on their new planet. Liz's husband Leo back in the planet earth was already a dead man due to the viral epidemic in the planet and humanity was doomed to go extinct. It exceeded my expectations and at times it got really sentimental. And there are some logical issues such as why would MILO answer questions that are not concerning her health and why would she have Internet connection during the space travel? And more important why wouldn't the system immediately do something to put her back to sleep or just ""deactivate"" her? For the sake of the twist they sacrificed a bit of logic in the screenplay.",Oxygen
23,bob-the-movie-man,A taut mystery horror/thriller that goes off in surprising directions!,7,29 May 2021,"In ""Oxygen"" Liz Hansen (Mélanie Laurent) wakes up in a sealed chamber with no memory of why she is there or how she got there. Her only ""companion"" is 'Milo': the Alexa-like operating system for the chamber. Milo helpfully advises her that her oxygen supply is already down below 40%, and falling. Can she piece together her swiss-cheese brain to find a way out of her predicament?Positives:
No spoilers here, but this is a 'small' mystery movie that goes off in a VERY surprising direction. The script is genuinely unpredictable.Mélanie Laurent gives a strong performance as the heroine near the end of her tether.Although this is a French film, don't let that put you off. Netflix gives options of the original French, French with subtitles and an English dub. And the English dubbing is so good that it took me until some sub-titles for text written in French before I realised it was dubbed!Negatives:
After the long drip-drip-drip of context, I found the ending to be something of a disappointment. Too twee.I found something morally dubious about the 're-routing' request near the end of the movie. (Although, I'm sure given the options, I would probably do the same!)If you don't like jump scares, you are likely to spill a lot of hot drinks while watching this one!Warnings: I occasionally stick into my reviews 'viewer advisories'. You won't need me to comment that this one will be a no-no for anyone suffering from claustrophobia. But I will add to that, since it's not obvious, that this is a movie that is also not suitable for musophobics: those with a fear of mice. Also, IMDB describes this one as ""Drama, Fantasy, Sci-fi"". Not Horror. But be warned that there are some genuinely effective jump scares in this one!Summary Thoughts on ""Oxygen"": You can recognize a 'lockdown-produced movie' a mile off. Typically it focuses on a handful of players, who are mostly socially isolated. Here is a classic example. Yet by doing that, the director is forced to focus in on character and dialogue. As such, some of these 'small' movies that rein in the director's excesses are far better as a result.""Oxygen"" is a case in point. When I saw that the film was directed by Alexandre Aja - the man behind the OTT ""Piranha 3D"" and the equally OTT popcorn-croc movie ""Crawl"" from 2 years ago, I feared the worst. But this an intriguing little movie that mystifies and jolts in equal measure. There is probably no such thing anymore as a truly novel thriller or science fiction film. And this draws recognisably from a host of other movies: I personally recognised elements from ""Room"", ""Solaris"", ""Moon"" and ""Gravity"" in there. But the closest similarity is definitely to the Ryan Reynolds 2010 thriller ""Buried"" which features a very similar initial set-up. If ""Oxygen"" were to have pulled out an ending like that film (if you haven't watched it yet - do so!) that it would have been a mini-classic.(For the full graphical review, please check out One Mann's Movies on the web or Facebook. Thanks).",Oxygen

Waking up trapped in a cryogenic unit, the main character had to figure out who she was before oxygen ran out.The first 2/3rd of this movie was pretty typical of a claustrophobic thriller. It built up certain things before the twist came.And there wasn't only one twist. The last third act became a showdown of twists with each one coming after another as the main character figured out what was going on. This was where tension became high, and when I enjoyed the movie the most.There were fear, panic, and confusion about what was real and not. And Mélanie Laurent played the role very well and delivered all the emotion.The visuals were also stunning. The camera angles on the main character throughout the movie were creative. There were also other visuals, but I can't talk about them without spoilers.Overall, an entertaining last third act made up for the typical buildup.

27,msbreviews,"Oxygen is a phenomenal example of one-location filmmaking done right, which will, unfortunately, escape most viewers' radar.",8,15 May 2021,"If you enjoy reading my Spoiler-Free reviews, please follow my blog :)Alexandre Aja caught my attention when he delivered one of the biggest surprises of 2010, Piranha 3D. A vast majority of viewers expected that film to be absolutely awful, and while I don't exactly love it, I added the director to my list of filmmakers to follow closely. After years of trials and errors, Aja apparently found his great breakthrough with 2019's Crawl. A disaster flick that, once again, people anticipated to be one of the worst movies of the year, and it ended up as one of the very best in the genre, at least in recent memory. Therefore, I was obviously not going to miss Oxygen, a French-speaking film that boasts a highly mysterious premise.Movies like this make spoiler-free reviews really challenging to put together. This Netflix film possesses dozens of plot twists and impactful revelations that I just can't delve into, so it's tough to share my complete thoughts on the most significant moments of the movie. So, I'll work around the explicit answers to the intriguing questions that ultimately make this film incredibly captivating. Christie LeBlanc offers a fascinating screenplay packed with everything a one-location, claustrophobic, enigmatic thriller should have to be successful. Honestly, it's one of the most well-written scripts I've seen in quite a while within the genre.For those viewers who hate ambiguous movies, Oxygen is far from it. Every single question raised by the narrative is clearly answered. No viewer will leave disappointed for not understanding hidden meanings or vague themes. However, I can't state this enough: LeBlanc's screenplay holds *dozens* of questions and the same amount of answers. It's impossible to convince everyone in the audience to accept every twist, especially during the revelation-heavy third act. From a specific moment onwards, it's an overwhelming flow of shocking information that might prove too much for some spectators. Nevertheless, most viewers enjoy nitpicking something that isn't present in this film: ""movie logic"" issues.If you've seen the film already, you're either going to wholly agree with my latest statement, or you probably think we watched different movies. As usual with this type of problem, it all depends on people's perspective and mentality regarding heavy sci-fi elements or truly advanced technology. In fact, for many audiences all around the world, just the fact that Mélanie Laurent's character is stuck in a futuristic-looking cryogenic pod with a Siri-like AI helping her understand what's happening is already stretching their believability limits. Not everyone can suspend disbelief in the same way, so I won't be surprised if Oxygen receives a more divisive public response.Nevertheless, I firmly believe this will end up as one of the most overlooked/underrated films of 2021. Aja proves his tremendous talent behind the camera by making an average-length movie inside one of the tiniest places a protagonist was ever stuck in for most of the runtime. Each new block of information about the where, how, why, and when concerning the main narrative is carefully handed to the viewers with *just* the right hints to what's truly going on. Even though the audience is also imprisoned in the same place for almost two hours, Aja and Maxime Alexandre (DP) create innovative, suspenseful manners of keeping the momentum going, never letting the film feel too monotonous or tiresome.Mélanie Laurent's exceptional performance is one of the most vital elements of the movie. Without her terrific display, it would be extremely challenging to continue to feel invested in the character's mission of finding out everything that's happening to her, including who she is. Her role requires ridiculous emotional range, and Laurent demonstrates all of her immense talent. Technically, the cryogenic pod features impressive technology, some of it created by remarkable VFX. The ominous score by Robin Coudert also brings another layer of mystery and suspense to the already obscure film. Overall, it's a perfect example of how low-budget movies can still be astonishingly well-made.Finally, Aja and LeBlanc bring several themes to the table, identity maybe being the biggest one. What truly makes us human? Feelings and memories? Physical suffering? It's impossible to dive into this subject without spoiling some of the most shocking moments of the story, but it's only one of many underlying storylines that ultimately make Oxygen a beautiful example of profound storytelling. General topics such as health and politics are also approached, as well as moral dilemmas regarding extremely advanced technology and what humans should do with it. Honestly, it's been three days, I watched two other films meanwhile, and I'm still thinking about this one...Oxygen is a phenomenal example of one-location filmmaking done right, which will, unfortunately, escape most viewers' radar. Christie LeBlanc's extremely detailed screenplay packs shocking, impactful revelations and plot twists that will leave no one indifferent. Brutal moral dilemmas, surprising discoveries about the mysterious protagonist, and a fantastic one-woman show from Mélanie Laurent keep the slow, flashback-heavy narrative engrossing. Boasting many underlying themes, Alexandre Aja maintains a suspenseful, tense atmosphere with a sense of urgency that never quite leaves the screen. Maxime Alexandre's creative camera work and Robin Coudert's mood-setting score elevate this deep study about human identity without ever feeling too ambiguous. For fans of claustrophobic thrillers with sci-fi elements, Netflix currently holds one of my favorite movies of the year. Highly recommend it.Rating: A-",Oxygen

34,sweidman-28016,Tense From Start to Finish,7,24 May 2021,"""I cannot satisfy that request for now.""In Oxygen, a woman wakes in a cryogenic chamber with no recollection of how she got there. As she's running out of oxygen, she must rebuild her memory to find a way out of her nightmare. This is a surprise. I'm not sure many thought this would be a good movie really. With Alexandre Aja's directorial track record, it's been misses most of the time. The only movie of his that I watched was Crawl a couple summers ago, and I didn't mind that one. Maybe not as good as it could be, but Oxygen is a tense ride from start to finish. If there's one thing going for it, the atmosphere makes for an entertaining watch. So much suspense is built that you'll want to know what's going to happen next. The first act is pretty predictable in terms of what beats it's going to hit. If you've seen Buried with Ryan Reynolds, the two bear many similarities. And at points it does feel like a knock off version. But with as many turns it takes, it diverges into its own thing by the third act. More developments in the story could've been useful, however.The most fleshed out aspect is character. Being in one location with one character obviously gives us a good sense of character. Mélanie Laurent as Liz is extremely good. This movie went through a bunch of setbacks before production and Anne Hathaway and Noomi Rapace were attached to the character before Aja was ultimately chosen for the director. She's really good. Basically, she carries the movie. I also appreciate the voice acting from Matthieu Amalric as M. I. L. O. A few times through there are flashback sequences that draw away from the main story. They serve as character development but honestly don't do much. It's awkward and could've been cut out. Because if we're being honest, all we wanted to see in this movie was the struggle to survive. There are many things that should be kept secret before watching to avoid any hints at the reveals. Oxygen is good, but could've been better. It's one of those that would be good for a movie night, though.",Oxygen

However the acting, direction and score all work at their best, so it could be far worse. The biggest problem though is the running time, at 1h 40m it's way too long and a good edit would help greatly.",Oxygen
36,President_George_Washington,FROM THE DESK OF GEORGE WASHINGTON,5,18 May 2021,"Good Morrow, countrymenI like Alexander Aja. I like he how attempts different genres in each new release; Haute Tension (brilliant) to The 9th Life of Louis Drax (not my thing), he mixes it up. Here, he's giving Science Fiction a go - and the result is uneven.We learn Earth has a real deadly virus (not an overblown one for a change), all humans will be extinct in two generations. Solution? Make clones, put them on a massive space ship and send them light-years into the abyss to populate a planet that's barely inhabitable...they have to inhabit in the portion that is neither daytime nor night, they must rebuild in the area that is permanently dusk. It's a pointless detail. Earthlings in this story are advanced, the universe is big, why not keep it simple and have them relocate to normal planet.Despite our intellectual abilities, we're still not smart enough to avoid a collision with a named/identified Asteroid/MacGuffin that destroys a good chunk of our plucky space ship, but able to continue on. The space rock isn't important...it's only needed for the plot.From my vast knowledge of space travel, we should have shields or something. Also, a Stargate would be helpful. Oh well...perhaps the Asgard will lend an assist. Thor? Anybody?Anyway, a cloned woman accidently wakes up from ""hyper-sleep,"" and instead of getting up and enjoying a mini-vacation in space like Hollywood's Pratt/Lawrence did in the silly, Passengers, she is trapped in her pod without any knowledge of what happened. She initially doesn't know she's a clone; possess only fragments of her memory left over from the super brilliant Strong Women that she was made from.Like all ""hyper-sleep"" pods, this one is equipped with a talking computer who informs her that oxygen is running out, thanks HAL, I mean MILO. The helpful and homicidal pod also keeps trying to inject her with a death serum - I have to admit; the automated injector arm was amusingly quick - darting around her attempts to grab it. It made no sense, but it's entertaining and a nice touch to add some action to an essentially one-location, cramped set.There's always a timer, isn't there? It's a nifty way to create tension. Simple set-up and fairly entertaining first act. The problems arise once we find out more about her predicament and the subsequent collapse of logic.With the help of the talking computer, she is able to make a phone call home. As she's chatting, she's told that the connection is getting weak and they will soon lose the ability to communicate. Hokey dokey...we also learn later on that she's been in the pod 12 years - moreover, she's never been out of the pod...bummer for her, convenient for the plot. I would ask why the pod has so much tech in it, when its only purpose is providing medical assistance, to include euthanasia, until they reach their destination?Once the film was over, I gave it some thought. There are moments of entertainment here, great camera work given the environment. A solid attempt to dole out the mystery slowly. A reasonable acting job by the main clone. As a homeowner with a lot of Maple Trees, I did appreciate the artistic design of the pods...deploy and let them ""helicopter"" to the surface.So much was left unanswered. Such as supplies needed...did we clone any animals, plants, food, shelter? I like cats, so any cat clones on the planet? Who knows?Aja, ended up telling the wrong story. He made the universe outside of his main storyline much more interesting. Ultimately, the plight of one hapless clone wasn't important. Her death or success wasn't important. It was just one small occurrence wrapped in a much larger story.With all that, it's still worth watching and if you're an Aja fan as I am, it's worth your time...but, it's not better than a 5 star in my view.Fare thee well, it's hoecakes and Madeira time.",Oxygen
37,DeBBss,Great visuals; unmotivating plot,6,29 May 2021,"Oxygen is a technically impressive film. It has great cinematography even though the entire film takes place in a box. Although, with its impressive visuals, it lacks in a gripping story. I found it really hard to stay focused when the entire film is just stagnant on one plot point. Oxygen isn't a long film, but it felt like it took forever because the character is doing the same thing for 1hr 40 mins. What kept me through the movie was me wanting to know why Elizabeth is in this certain situation. But the giant reveal was a ""meh"". It wasn't exactly bad, but I certainly wasn't blown away. And the acting was good, a little repetitive, but still good nonetheless.Oxygen is a 6/10 for me. I really wanted to give it a higher score, but the story was the least bit interesting. I eventually got bored and it quickly became a chore to finish this movie. It's still pretty decent, and it's worth a watch if you're into this type of genre.",Oxygen

Director: Alexandre Aja
Starring: Melanie Laurent.Overall rating 94/100Oxygen is about a woman who wakes up in a cryogenic chamber with no recollection of how she got there. As she's running out of oxygen, she must rebuild her memory to find a way out of her nightmare.Wow Oxygen was an incredible psychological thriller. It truly made the most out of its limited setting. The idea of being trapped inside a container with your oxygen slowly going down was really intriguing. The cinematography was really creative, there was an incredibly tense atmosphere and tone, almost making you feel claustrophobic just like the main character. The setting up of the stakes was excellent. There was a really interesting mystery throughout. The performance from Melanie Laurent was fantastic. The development to the plot and main character was excellent. The main character was also clever and made good logical decisions which made a nice change. The emotional weight and sympathy for the main character was well earned. The rising of tension and added layering to the stakes was fantastic. The plot twists were insane. I also loved the slow reveal of the character background for the main character. The set up for the final act and the final act itself was fantastic. The emotional decisions the main character had to make was very intense and I had never seen something like this before with having to decide how much of your life expectancy to take away. The jumpscares and the gore was very effective. And it was a satisfying ending.My slight negatives would be the repetitive failures for the main character largely due to the one setting, and I would of liked slightly more depth to the main character and the story world. Also the English dubbing was slightly annoying but that wasn't the films fault.Overall, Oxygen is a clever, intense, and engaging psychological thriller, that keeps you on edge throughout constantly trying to figure out what's real. It was a very well done film, that just needed that little bit more depth to have slightly more impact.",Oxygen

This guessing game keeps things interesting despite the otherwise minimalist nature of the movie. Mélanie Laurent carries the film as almost the only actor, and while she doesn't have the most memorable/charismatic character, she does a bang up job bringing the situation to life. Once the cards are laid on the table, there are definitely some stretches in logic that ask a lot of your suspension of disbelief, but that may be a petty gripe for sci-fi.>>>>>>>>>>>MILD SPOILER<<<<<<<<<<<<It's interesting to ponder how much the pandemic influenced the film, which began production in July 2020. The single actress in a box was probably great for social distancing, but you gotta wonder how much of this was the plan before it was a necessity?

46,danybur,An anguished reconstruction of identity,8,17 May 2021,"Summary:Oxygen is much more than a film about confinement or a mere claustrophobic exercise that takes place in real time: it is a spatial elegy that tells us about the indissoluble relationship between identity and memory, about the anguished reconstruction of the latter and that at the same time time that wears elegant and sober high-tech devices, lavishes moments of ineffable poetry and more than one epiphany.It is another of those films with many merits (and undeniable affiliations) that instead of analyzing it for what it is, some criticize it for what it is not or for what it ""should be"".Review:The film begins with Elizabeth Hansen (Mélanie Laurent) ""waking up"" in a cryogenic capsule that has a virtual medical assistant called MILO (in the voice of Mathieu Amalric) who informs her that due to a technical malfunction, the oxygen levels in the module are dropping. Constantly. But who is Elizabeth? Why is she there? Where is that capsule? The protagonist will look for answers and a possible way out of her distressing situation.Oxygen is another of those films with many merits that instead of analyzing it for what it is, some criticize it for what it is not or what it should be according to them or establish superficial comparisons or affiliations with others. It is an intimate science fiction film where the protagonist must face an initial situation of absolute confusion (she does not know who she is, or where she is or why), as if her awakening were a new birth, a chrysalis trying to get out of her confinement. That is why Oxygen is much more than a film about the confinement or a mere claustrophobic exercise.The film takes place in real time inside the capsule and constitutes for the protagonist a strenuous exercise of rebuilding her identity from memory (with her exterior screenshots), interacting with the friendly but relentlessly algorithmic MILO (reminiscent of the HAL of 2001 but also of current virtual assistants)The director Alexandre Aja knows how to make the most of the successful design of the capsule and skilfully does not incur repetitions (filming in such a narrow location is a challenge) counting on the great performance of Laurent (in a true tour de force acting ).If we have to look for affiliations, I would point to Gravity and 7500 (which takes place almost entirely in an airplane cabin) and others that I cannot reveal, although in this case the coordinates are clearly futuristic science fiction.There is in this film a certain ineffable poetry and more than one epiphanic moment, aided by ROB's remarkable electronic music.Oxygen is a spatial elegy that has all the resources to move the viewer.",Oxygen

61,Sankari_Suomi,A miasmic ebb & flow of confluent possibilities,7,22 May 2021,"Alexandre Aja and Grégory Levasseur. What could possibly go wrong? Quite a lot actually, but somehow we ended up with a winner.First conceived as a Christie LeBlanc screenplay in 2017, Oxygène struggled through years of production hell. The original decision to cast Anne Hathaway in the lead role was quickly recognised as a mistake, and she was soon replaced by Noomi Rapace. Franck Khalfoun came on board to direct, with Aja producing.But by 2020 it was all falling apart. Aja kicked Khalfoun out of the director's chair and seized it for himself, while Rapace was dismissed over concerns about 'ideological syncretism.'Following a discussion with investors that Aja later described as 'passionate but not entirely unreasonable, with intermittent screams', Mélanie Laurent was chosen as the new lead.Oxygène won't win any awards for innovation, and leans a trifle too heavily on its meagre cast of just three(!) credited characters, but its heart is in the right place and its cinematography implies the budget of a much bigger film than it actually is.Mathieu Amalric is the clear audience favourite, with his cool and calming Parisian tones. Malik Zidi does what he usually does, and does it tolerably well. But it is Laurent who really steals the show as she grapples with the dilemmas of a late middle aged existential crisis.It was Foucault who said 'People know what they do; frequently they know why they do what they do; but what they don't know is what what they do does.' Oxygène takes this wisdom and toys with it, teasing out the conceptual strands for a gentler, more compassionate examination.Aja and Levasseur are intent on answering the questions we almost never dare to ask: questions about life, memory, dreams, and the philosophy of loveplay. The conceptual framework here is reminiscent of Brecht and Eisler, but with a distinctly Büchnerian flavour. It's an aggressively bold experiment, and I revelled in the audacity of it all.I rate Oxygène at 23.31 on the Haglee Scale, which works out as a perky 7/10 on IMDB.",Oxygen

71,ObsessiveCinemaDisorder,An engaging functional sci-fi trapped room thriller,7,23 May 2021,"Oxygen, the new trapped room sci-fi thriller on Netflix, does a decent enough job playing with its claustrophobic premise to entertain the audience. For audiences who have seen trapped room movies like Buried, Cube or Panic Room, it is familiar territory.A woman wakes up trapped in an airtight cryogenic pod and discovers the oxygen levels are running low. With no memory of who she was or how she got there and using the online A. I. MILO, she must figure out a way to open the pod before the air runs out.Mélanie Laurent, from Inglourious Basterds, does a great job selling the claustrophobia, peril and eventual paranoia. The central mystery kept me hooked and guessing what was going on. When the final reveal came, I wasn't as surprised as I should have been from my knowledge of genre conventions and there could have been more red herrings emplaced to make me doubt what was going on.The film is directed by Alexander Aja, who directed one of my favorite films from 2019, the alligator thriller Crawl. That was a movie that viscerally places the audience into its horror scenario and they can imagine it happening to them in that real world setting. I actually felt more trapped in Crawl than in Oxygen. The sci-fi setting here kills all the tension.Oxygen, while entertaining as a one-time watch, feels like a step back for Aja. Oxygen plays like a student film with a professional budget, like a first-time director showcasing what they could do if they were given more money. But I know already. I have seen Crawl.Ultimately, I wanted more from Oxygen, whether that means more playing around with genre expectations, plot twists or a personal statement.",Oxygen

113,JoelAlexanderr,Highly underrated confined thriller with talent all across the board,9,26 May 2021,"OXYGEN exceeds all expectations of what a confined thriller can be. Mélanie Laurent plays a woman who is trapped in a cryogenic chamber and cannot remember how she got there or who she is. At first, it seems like typical pandemic movie that showcases Laurent's incredible acting chops, but as the film progresses and more is revealed, the film ends up being far more intricate than it lets on. Laurent is incredible throughout this film and carries the narrative effortlessly despite being the only character we see (for the most part). Director Alexandre Aja also brings a lot to a little, making a movie that is shot in one location feel grand in scale through amazing visual effects and enthralling storytelling. Another highlight is the score by Robin Coudert, which builds suspense like a horror movie at times and then transitions to a grandiose build that feels like a science fiction epic a la Blade Runner.This film is one of the biggest surprises of this year so far, and might be one of my favorite ""pandemic"" movies yet.

115,willcrabbe,Solid but unremarkable sci-fi thriller,6,18 June 2021,"Oxygen is a French psychological thriller directed by experienced horror director Alexandre Aja (High Tension, The Hills Have Eyes, Crawl) and stars Melanie Laurent and Mathieu Amalric.After a woman (Laurent) wakes up in a cryogenic chamber with no memory of who she is or how she got there, she realises the chamber is quickly running out of oxygen and must work with an AI (voiced by Amalric) to find a way to escape before time runs out.The film is similar to Rodrigo Cortes's Buried (2010) in many regards. Both films follow a single character trapped inside a box with a limited supply of air which serves as the central ticking time bomb of the narrative. However, Oxygen differs in that there's a much greater focus on story and exposition. We piece together alongside the main character the history and sequence of events that led to the current situation through various flashbacks and memory jogs.Up until around the hour mark, Oxygen doesn't quite have the right to call itself a thriller as apart from the opening scenes, we were treated to a rather dull affair. The setting was no where near as claustrophobic as the pitch-black coffin of Buried, and the sense of dread and impending doom was not portrayed as effectively as it should have.What Oxygen does better though is produce a more visually striking film with some interesting science fiction concepts that explore thematic elements regarding the nature of consciousness and the drive of human survival. There are some twists and turns that caught me off guard and a strong central performance from Melanie Laurent, but I do feel it could have benefited from the same claustrophobic simplicity that made Buried great.",Oxygen

At that point things start to get kind of interesting but then the ending is extremely rushed. It's okay (I've seen way worse) but it would have been better if the first hour was cut and they focused more on how they got from the middle of the movie to the end of the movie. There is a huge gap that I imagine they cut for time. Overall not good but not terrible.,Oxygen

Like Brie Larson's toes--rather than treating the infection--she has just painted over it with nail polish leading to claw like deformity of her fingertips.

I love the creativity of this movie. A movie explaining the scientific concepts, our future, and current technology & the effect of that technology on the human condition with details.99% of filmmaking is done in the cryogenic chamber with tension, suspense, and emotions.The movie is shooted in only one location with one character of Melanie Laurent & she played her character brilliantly. She deserves an Oscar for her performance.What I love about this movie is the uncertainty of where the movie is going. Where is the pod? Who is she? Will she get out?

They did a good job with futuristic vibe.The Bad- The twist in the final act I sort of saw coming. The CGI isn't the best either.

For me, personally, it was a herculean effort to constantly watch her freak out, but it had some really dicey moments when you didn't know what was going to happen...her reactions may have been more appropriate there.

I usually hate French cinema, even though I loved 70ies to 80ies French cinema, they lost their way, but I enjoyed this one, it makes me wonder if I should start watching French cinema again. I love the ""1 Room"" movies, and this one is on par with what's existing already. There's some excusable problems with the script when they're undermining some payoffs, by adding a twist on a twist on a twist on a twist... which makes it all look less important at the end, but the rest is very good! The acting is clean and believable, orchestration is what you'd expect, the ""stage"" is fine, even though the small screens inside the pods look like they were taken from an 80ies knight riders dash board, it's still excusable since it doesn't take you out too much. The flashbacks shouldn't have been used in the beginning of the movie, it just make it look weird, but later on, they're at the right place.

I can understand why some are disappointed. No outrageous cgi and effects were limited but I am tired of movies being carried on effects mostly with a platoon strong group of main characters.As said I enjoyed it. Kids did enjoy that too. The little one was shortly off at the end but I guess that was too much for 10yo.I gave it 7 for good acting and good story.

With that said, the directors made a good job and definitely did something unique to make it as good as it is.The only reason I am giving it a 9 is because the area of filming was limited.

Plus Oxygen gives us an exquisite glimpse in Turing questioning about man and computer, yeah you have to watch it to know what I'm talking about and maybe Imitation Game too.It's the absolute genius of storytelling with a great development and evolution of situation where you're automatically put in character, with the sensation of living the exact situation and will inevitably try to solve the puzzle with the main character just to find out you'd be totally lost if it was really you ahah.

This film is best experienced as a wild ride.I simply love how creative it was. Excellent filmmaking required to make a movie set 99% of the time in a cryogenic chamber riveting and suspenseful, though a huge amount of the credit for that goes to the lead actress. I've never seen her in anything before but she was simply phenomenal. Without her this could have gone a different way but if nothing else watch it for her performance.This is what sci-fi is meant to be: exploring how our current and future technologies affect the human condition. The details of the science itself are certainly fascinating but what it gets right is showing what that means for humanity as a whole AND the individual, and what it means for our future. I see that lacking in a lot of sci-fi and so it's always refreshing to see.I can understand where some of the negative reviews are coming from but in my (naturally subjective) opinion they simply don't outweigh the good and in many cases are wrong.

The twists in the plot were great, and it's really sci-fi in the sense of that it makes you rethink everything, how would I react if x happened to me, and what humanity is capable of and what's ethic and not.

Suffering from memory loss, she does not remember who she is or how she got there. She is assisted by an advanced A. I. named MILO, but it refuses to open the cryo unit without an administrator code. Using MILO, she is able to transmit outside the pod and contact emergency services. She provides them with the cryo unit's model and serial number, which are printed on the interior. Upon contacting the manufacturer they are told the unit was destroyed three years prior. Unable to recall her memories, she looks for clues about her past by searching for pictures and articles through the AI computer and finds her name, Elizabeth Hansen. She realizes she is a cryogenic doctor. She finds her husband, Léo Ferguson, and his contact number by accessing her social media, but when she calls his number a woman answers. She tells the woman that she is Léo's wife and demands to speak to him. The woman seems confused and hangs up.As the oxygen level continues to fall, she begins hallucinating and tries to open the pod, only to be electrocuted. She then receives a call back from the police but suspects they are hiding something from her, and disconnects. The unknown woman she called earlier rings and tells her that her husband is dead. She also gives her the administrator code to open the pod, but tells her she cannot open the pod or she will die. Elizabeth uses the code, and begins floating without gravity. After a brief explanation, it is revealed that she has been placed into hyper-sleep for a 14 light-year journey to another planet. Her secret mission is to travel to a new planet, as mankind will be extinct in the near future due to a deadly virus. The virus also killed her husband, Léo.Heartbroken by the truth, she deduces the awakening was due to a processor overheating and realizes she must divert the functions of the processor to another processor assigned to non-essential functions, but initially fails since the data exceeds capacity. As time passes by and with oxygen levels fading, she prepares for suicide by attempting to open the pod. Shortly after, she discovers Léo is also in hypersleep in the damaged spaceship together with nearly 10,000 others, but she notices he lacks a scar on his forehead that he had before. Upon further investigation, through a video presented by an elderly version of her, it is revealed that she is a genetic clone with the original Elizabeth Hansen's personality and memories implanted, including memories of Léo. The woman she has been speaking to on earth is the original, and now elderly, Elizabeth Hansen.MILO activates a euthanasia protocol due to a non-existence chance of survival, however Elizabeth's clone manages to deactivate it and successfully diverts the functions of the processor and is put back in hypersleep. The final scene shows the clones of Léo and Elizabeth on the new planet smiling, embracing each other.",Oxygen

191,stevenevans-28597,One of the Few Good Sci-Fi Movies.,8,6 November 2021,"Good sci-fi is extremely difficult to find. Many sci-fi movies are a bit too unrealistic and unfamiliar, for my taste. ""Star Wars"" is an excellent example. It feels too much like fantasy, rather than sci-fi. Because those types of movies tend to do well, that's what is created most often.On the other hand, some producers try to make realistic sci-fi, but then tend to forget that they're making a sci-fi movie. So, instead of focusing on a thought-provoking, sci-fi concept, it focuses on basic drama. The Netflix show ""Away"" is a good example.So, it really is difficult to find thought-provoking, serious sci-fi -- something that strikes the right balance between an interesting science-based concept, while providing a realistic atmosphere with realistic characters. This movie strikes that balance.To date, ""I Am Mother"" is my favorite Netflix movie. It has all of the ingredients for a great sci-fi movie, and it truly delivers. This movie, ""Oxygen"", falls into that category of good writing. I don't quite like it as much as ""I Am Mother"", but it's certainly one of the good ones.If you're interested in serious science fiction, with realistic characters, no comedy, and a good concept, then you really should watch this movie. There's a lot of crap out there, and good sci-fi movies, like this one, are really hard to find.",Oxygen

198,kimbrys,Attendez la crème,8,17 May 2021,"Patience, as Hans Landa suggests. It's easy to get carried away with criticism, when watching a low-budget movie, especially Sci-Fi, when your expectations have been raised with the likes of (Insert your favorite high-budget Sci-Fi movie).The story (and acting) did all the heavy lifting. This movie does a great job in conveying the claustrophobic experience Melanie's character has to go through, with the countdown to death keeping the suspense. Plot keeps you guessing with each twist, and makes the audience imagine what they would go through in each step. Granted, some decisions can seem far-fetched, irratic, but given the conditions and the origins of the main character, it should be enough to forgive its flaws.This movie gave me ""Moon (2009)"" vibes, eliciting a virtual simulation of an emotional ride I would have, if I was in the protagonist shoes (pod).",Oxygen

How could it have been done better than this during the pandemic? Couldn't.... right?I can't help myself mentioning all of the positive reviews this movie has. WOW! It is soooo grrreaaaaatttttt! (LOL)As a bonus, we have one of those kind of movies that were built (and growing) towards a plot twist in the end. Well, it is an interesting plot twist... and even in these circumstances, the pace throughout the whole movie is always engaging.So why would I rate this movie with just 2 stars?(one star to Melanie... and another to all the tech & visuals team)
Because, in the end, I found a tiny detail in this movie that ruins the whole show. The M. I. L. O. - a kind of an hi-tech ""in-flight entertainment"" (IFE) system 😂I mean, no matter how advanced our civilization is during this time, this simple question turns this whole movie into a meaningless crap. If the whole purpose of this movie is leading us - leading the sheep - towards a final plot twist, why the hell all of the 10.000 pods would have a built-in hi-tech IFE System that even allowed the clones to make phone calls to Earth? What?! And browsing internet... maybe playing Playstation... WHAT?! I mean, Liz is a clone. Something goes wrong and... BOOM!... she will be terminated with a needle sting. But, well, in the meantime, if the needle-thing goes wrong ""Let's give her a super-hi-tech-IFES for her own amusement, shall we? The last thing we want is to bore a clone to death!""WHAT?!ABSOLUTELY RI-DI-CU-LOUS!!! CHEAP!!! I mean, M. I. L. O. is the only ""tiny"" detail in the script that allowed this movie to exist in the first place. So this is how much this whole movie is ridiculous. A shot in the foot!... and everybody loved it!

Unfortunately 50 minutes of oxygen was all I could muster for this story. ""Movie"" is also a term I wouldn't use for it, since literally nothing moves really: No character development, minimal plotline and very restricted body movement from the main character. It felt like one of those long jokes you have to sit through simply to see if the punchline is worth the wait. That just annoys me, but that's personal of course. During ""oxygene"" came this breaking point for me where, regardless the brilliance of the plot, it wouldn't justify me having to go through another minute of boredom basically. I just didn't care. The challenge for the producers obviously was to deliberately minimize space and character and still get the audience hooked, but they failed for me.

203,akonaludidi,Engaging performance,7,12 May 2021,"Oxygen is a Netflix sci-fi thriller directed by Alexandra Aja.Melanie Laurent carried this one scene, one actress movie beautifully. The movie opens with the main character waking up inside a cryogenic pod with no recollection of who she is or how she ended up there. Her only ally is the AI, MILO, manning the chamber.The first act is mainly Liz (the MC) freaking out, trying to remember who she is and how she got into this predicament. The second act is filled with impending gloom as she realises that she's quickly expanding her oxygen supplies yet has no means of escape. These were the most thrilling and engaging aspects of the movie because we experienced the frustration, claustrophobia and fear along with Liz. The cinematography does a great job of emphasising this claustrophobic environment as well as capturing the futuristic pod.The let down is in the third act for me, I thought it fell a little flat from what was promised. Regardless, it kept me on my toes the entire time.",Oxygen

I adore this movie for taking his viewers by the hand and exploring the world and its rules together with the protagonist. I might have to add here that I feel like I was born for movies like this, its exactly right up my alley. The suspense is through the roof and the twists are well executed and honestly not really predictable, for me at least. It left me speechless at times. Only thing which arent that mindblowing are the flashbacks. Those scenes are a bit ""standard"" in a way, but are needed in order to understand the protagonist more.Cinematography & Camera: The overall look of this movie is very digital and CGI-heavy. The place the protagonist is in is filmed in a special and claustrophobic way and reminded me a lot of buried (2010) - in a good way!Acting: The acting is really great. She carried the movie single-handedly in a way I still have some of her scenes right before my eyes even weeks later.Final Thoughts: Fantastic ""remix"" of the movie Buried (2010) with added elements which enhances the concept of movies like Buried by a lot!

From the first scene to the last, one revelation of the storyline segued into another so swiftly, the credit goes to the director for managing to build the film so craftily. The audience will hardly be able to digress from the film, it is quite enthralling.The film started off steadily, kept the audience almost in the dark until the middle of the film. Then in the midway after revealing some strings of the plot, some might think they know where this is going, though it still made many swift unpredictable turns, but still by midway you would start to care about the character and keep on going.

253,mickeythechamp,A movie that feels like it has more going on than it actually has,3,15 May 2021,"I watched this movie because it was new at the time on Netflix, and I had to review a current film for my podcast. I therefor went in relatively blind. This review might contain slight spoilers.The movie is about a woman that wakes up in a Futuristic medical pod. She has lost her memory and most uncover who she is and how to save herself before the medical pod runs out of oxygen.This is a Sci-fi mystery movie, and it carries both roles only half well. The Sci-fi aspect comes from the fact the main character is stuck in a futuristic medical pod that has a computer installed called M. I. L. O. The computer system is more or less just Seri that can google whatever the main character needs. M. I. L. O as a plot device was really clever implemented. Not only does it give us a character the main character can talk too, but the way he works also makes it entirely up to the main character to work out the mystery. When she puts two and two together, she now can make a better google search in order to uncover the truth. M. I. L. O can not comment nor help her with solving the puzzle, he can only follow orders. This made it so more satisficing when the main character figured something out. Mélanie Laurent is more or less the only character we see and hear from. I think she could carry the role, but there were instances where I thought the movie was patted out with her being sad, and that sometimes made her preformance fell one-noted. Can we by the way get Mathieu Amalric as a Seri voice? Such a nice and soothing voice!The main problem comes from the location aspect and the mystery aspect of the movie. The location is more or less only the medical pod. Don't get me wrong, I love one location movies. I think it can create a great focus on the character we are watching instead of working on establishing worldbuilding. The problem here is that the pod quickly wears of as an interesting location, and the main charecter is not interesting enough to carry the movie. You quickly get the layout of the pod and the camera can only do so much to make it interesting. While it creates a sometimes claustrophobic look, it also sometimes feel like the pod is giant. There was a very beautiful transitional-shot towards the end just to say the camera crew clearly know what they are doing, but don't get a lot to work with.What the movie does les well to me is when it gets towards the middle and end. The start of the movie is the strongest part of it, but after a while the movie kinda runs out of tricks and mysteries and I was looking at the timer multiple times to find out how much was left of the movie. The movie tries to make a loot of schocking revelations, but they never really hit me as shocking. I quickly moved on from the revelations and even caught myself saying ""So?"" aloud to myself. Some of the set-ups to the mystery also has bad payoffs. You get a clue early on and layer it so you can use it in the puzzle, and then when it doesn't really make the puzzle look any better you just ask yourself ""why did I save this piece for so long?"" this is, among others, in relation to a clue such as Léon is working with helicopter leaves. The payoff to this is just not good.It also have some scary aspects to it, and here it does not stick to that genre either. It seems like the movie has multiple identitycrises doing it´s runtime and If it just stuck to one them it would feel more complete. Not a big fan of the ending either. It kinda made the movie seem pointless, as well as most of the moral dilemmas presented in the movie.Overall, I did not really enjoy my time with this movie, it seemed like it did not really know what It wanted to be, so it just became everything. It seemed like a movie without purpose or moral and kinda just went by. Even though I found the beginning of the movie strong, it simply does not save the rest of the runtime. I really don't know who I should recommend this to at all so I will end this by saying, it´s a too long movie with an identity crisis, too small scale to call it anything special yet too big for what it´s trying to do. The movie fells like it has a lot of cogs turning but it doesn't.",Oxygen

256,ABCloverLane,"Tight, inventive script and a superb Melanie Laurent",7,12 May 2021,"Oxygen might be Alexandre Aja's best movie to date.It's a one man show, or in this case, a one woman show, as Melanie Laurent delivers a performance worthy of praise as an amnesiac who awakens in a cryopod and tries to figure out how she got there and how she can escape with the help of the AI assisstant MILO. The movie's plot is reminiscent of Buried, starring Ryan Reynolds, only this time we're dealing with a high-concept idea that cannot be mentioned without spoiling the movie.What I liked the most about this movie is that throughout its entire runtime, it never once loses steam and is able to hold the attention of the viewer. Although it's set almost entirely in one location, the script always finds ingenious elements to keep the plot going and oftentimes it reaches that nail-biting tension the viewers expect from a sci-fi thriller like this.Melanie Laurent is entirely up to task and she carries this movie effortlessly. Her character's discoveries about her past, present and future offer moments that showcase her immense talent of making us care for a character that we, like the character itself, know nothing about.The direction from Alexandre Aja is never boring and he uses smart camera tricks to maintain tension and suspense. There's always a sense of engagement with the plot that Aja crafts masterfully, although some plot reveals are a little bit convenient and they come exactly when you expect them to.Overall, I thought Oxygen benefits from an inventive and well-written script, Aja's tight direction, and of course, Melanie Laurent's performance, who carries the entire movie on her shoulders.",Oxygen

She doesn't remember who she is, nor why she is trapped inside a cryochamber. Her only companion to whom she could talk to is an A. I. called MILO. MILO informed her that the oxygen reserves in her pod are only at 35% and she may die of asphyxiation she doesn't do anything about it. From here she decided to do some investigations on her own to find out everything she needs to know about who she was, where she is, why she's trapped in the cryochamber and how she can survive by using MILO to aid in her investigation.

266,Lostounet,"Breathe in, breathe out",7,12 May 2021,"""OXYGEN"" directed by Alexandre Aja and written by Christie Leblanc. Available on Netflix.When a woman wakes up in a cryogenic chamber with no memory, she'll struggle to escape as the oxygen in her capsule begins to become critical. Her only means of communication is an onboard computer named MILO with which she must discover who she is, why she is there, and how to remedy her nightmare before time runs out.The French director leaves the piranhas (Piranha 3D) and killer crocodiles (Crawl), to finally sign a high-concept thriller shot in claustrophobic atmosphere with a wonderful Melanie Laurent. The generous and involved French actress takes up the challenge with amazing interpretation. With her face and voice as her only means of expression, Laurent runs the gamut of emotions, from fear to anger to grief. She simply gives one of the best performances in an exercise where she was not particularly expected.While claustrophobes will start to feel dizzy, the narrative finally gets out of this ""jail"" and allows us to escape and discover her memories at the same time as the heroine does. The flashbacks in the hospitals, with masked patients and doctors, make the tension rise even more strongly on these particular days of COVID.Nevertheless, the film don't fall into weird conspiracy and remains on track avoiding even any resemblance with the thriller 'Buried' except for their concept of confinement. The script never ceases to surprise with its rich concept of thematic and narrative twists and turns, and feeds the curiosity of the viewer who constantly wonders about the resolution.Alexandre Aja directs a thriller in a confined environment of a very different kind, but very effective. With current themes of isolation, loss and fear of an uncertain future, ""Oxygen"" has never lived up to its name. Thanks to solid direction in an incredibly confined space and the phenomenal work of Melanie Laurent, the film becomes a welcome breath of fresh air in today's world.",Oxygen

To be honest I'd say that if I had watched it with the stereo speakers from my tv, i'd have stopped watching after 20-30 minutes.However that doesn't mean the movie is all about audio -indeed the plot contains interesting revelations- but sound is key here and is very well intertwined the image, so it is a major component of the movie (as opposed to marvel atmos movies for eg) and since it's a ""no exit"" movie (it all happens in one tiny closed space) the picture alone might become boring if no surround sound is there to accompany it (in reality the picture is what accompanies the audio).Now if you've got any 5.1 sound bar or better, the movie is great, but it's not for everyone, indeed being a no exit movie entails that fans of movies like the Avengers and other Marvel movies won't enjoy this as it might feel dull, but it's only because the sound here is what engages the viewer and creates a true immersion.",Oxygen

301,amit-ab87,"Either it is the stupidest protagonist, or the actor/director thinks the audience is stupid!",1,8 June 2021,"For all intents and purposes, the plot of this movie is same as Buried (2010). In Buried, the protagonist is a male and acts reasonably after discovering that he is buried in some kind of box.Now come the protagonist in this movie, a female. The character knows that oxygen is limited; yet the character throws tamper tantrums to the person on call who is trying to help; wastes critical oxygen in crying at least four times over some useless emotional fits; shouts and bemoans for being a clone, wasting more oxygen. There is no way anyone would act so foolishly in life-and-death situation such as the one the protagonist finds herself in.In all, it is infuriating to see the protagonist wasting time learning about fish, apologizing to an AI, hyper-emotional and unnecessary struggle. Wish they had either a better director or a protagonist whose actions are dictated by brain than by hormones.Totally wasted my mood.",Oxygen

OK there may have some implausible aspects from the scientific aspect but I felt the film to be really enthralling despite the lack of ""action"".

309,ircomerford,Suprisingly good thriller embracing the pandemic restrictions,8,12 May 2021,"The movie seems to have been written and filmed around pandemic restrictions. The majority of the movie is only the lead character and the flashback and other scenes are set in a world that has social distancing and PPE commonplace.It's a very claustrophobic thriller, quite literally. The twists are a little cliched but I'll admit I didn't catch on until the intended reveal.I enjoyed watching -- it holds up well with the sort of survival movies I like.",Oxygen

The story was super great! The setting is super great! This is one of my favorite scifi movies no doubt! Its a movie of surprice so next time i see it i know the plot but i can live with that (i hope i forget) nice experience of a story. This is a very nice movie from the start all the way to the end. A woman is waking up in a cryo-pod. Doest not recall any memories and try to figure out why she is trapped during the oxygen is running out. 10/10 best movie i saw this 2021.

321,byebenjamin,A small start explodes into a big ending,8,19 May 2021,"Alexandre is back again, now with a thrilling french sci-fi flick which feels both fresh and exiting. Mèlaine Laurent brings an excelent portrayl to how anybody would have felt in her situation. She also manages to keep the audience hooked when she is locked down in a box for the whole movie. In my eyes is that pretty damn impressive. The cinematogrophy feels fresh, the editing is good and the overall set design and CGI is very well done.Overall Oxygene deliver a new and stylish sci fi thriller wich blends ""burried"" and ""gravity"" into one. With some strong, yet somewhat cliche writing this is a movie worth watching.",Oxygen

It's not going to flood your blood with adrenaline up until the last minutes of the movie but when it comes to story and the way it is told you will definitely enjoy it! I'm telling you it's worth the time! The scenes are awesome the actor is awesome the story is awesome and it's really entertaining! Give it a try! An awesome but also slightly different space movie from Netflix!!!,Oxygen
324,zulmaidy,"Watch this by ""time-warp""",2,20 May 2021,"Five minutes into the movie I found myself simply fast-forwarding the scenes just to see how much longer she'd be stuck in that box.My verdict (spoiler alert):No solution, no salvation. Just a realisation, with no margin left for even a half-valiant attempt at a triumphant release.For the genre's sake, ""2001: A Space Odyssey"" is still far more rewarding, followed closely by the wondrous and poignant ""Interstellar.""There are at least a dozen other great and good sci-fi movies to watch or re-watch. This is not one of them.",Oxygen
325,meghanperry,Pretty useless to watch,1,1 June 2021,The overall movie is basically a woman suffering from and rare but common disease in this movie and this movie is pretty much useless to watch l would not recommend this movie to anyone.,Oxygen
