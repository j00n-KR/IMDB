0,Leofwine_draca,"Fairly good, and original...",6,7 March 2015,"LIMITLESS has the advantage of telling a fairly unusual story in a way that seems fresh and compelling, although there are serious problems with the narrative throughout. In essence it tells of an ordinary man - a struggling writer in New York - who comes into contact with an extraordinary drug that allows him to use 100% of his brain, rather than the 20% that the ordinary person supposedly uses.It's a story of rags to riches with a sting in the tail: like all drugs, this one is incredibly addictive and boasts some serious withdrawal symptoms to boot. Still, I particularly enjoyed watching the central character engage with the financial market, and use his new-found skills to make himself an almost overnight success.The story is enlivened by some cool special effects, particularly the endless zoom shot which whizzes through the streets and locales in a way which fizzes with energy (a shame then that it eventually becomes repetitive after it's used too much). The introduction of some Russian gangsters add some decent thriller aspects to the narrative, although certain sequences feel completely out of place (the subway fight, based around viewings of Bruce Lee flicks on TV, feels like something straight from the Thai martial arts flick CHOCOLATE). Bradley Cooper has never been a first choice for me as an actor, but he acquits himself pretty well here and De Niro is very good, as always.",Limitless
1,SnoopyStyle,Intriguing premise and Bradley Cooper,6,13 December 2014,"Eddie Morra (Bradley Cooper) is on a NYC balcony about to jump. He tells the audience that he has a 4 digit IQ but he missed something. The movie flashes back. Eddie is a blocked writer with a book contract. His girlfriend Lindy (Abbie Cornish) is tired of him and dumps him. He runs into ex-brother-in-law Vernon Gant. Vernon is with a pharmaceutical company and gives him an experimental drug. It activates all of the brain. When Eddie takes it, the effects are impressive and he writes tons of pages. The next day, he tries to get more from Vernon but he finds Vernon killed. Eddie discovers Vernon's stash. He finishes his book, learns everything, makes a killing in the market, and reconnects with Lindy and his ex-wife Melissa Gant (Anna Friel). His success draws the attention of business mogul Carl Van Loon (Robert De Niro).Director Neil Burger is using a lot of visual magic to emulate the effect. He's using blue to simulate the dull everyday world. I don't really like the cold artificial feel to the movie. Also I don't like the movie getting bog down with a business deal. The movie loses tension as it keeps going back to it. There are lots that I do like about the movie. I like Bradley Cooper although I don't necessarily like his character and I don't really like his narration. I find the premise very intriguing. I just wish this was a better movie where I could root for the character and be invested in the story more.",Limitless
2,Prismark10,Just limited,6,8 October 2013,"Limitless is a high concept movie. Bradley Cooper is an author suffering from writer's block and his life seems to be spiralling out of control.He comes across a designer drug called NZT that allows him to function his brain at greater heights. All of a sudden he becomes smarter, learns faster and recalls memory from the distant past.However the drug is not without side effects but very soon he attracts the attention of gangsters and business tycoons.Cooper invests in his character and is charismatic in the lead role. However the film becomes sloppy and silly even though it remains entertaining.It telegraphs all its moves. You just know who the bad guys are and what they are after.",Limitless

Meanwhile, the powerful investor Carl Van Loon (Robert De Niro) brings Eddie to work in his team in a merging operation. But Eddie is chased by a stranger and pressed by Gennady that want the NZT, threatening his life.""Limitless"" is an original and intriguing thriller with the story of a man capable to use the full capacity of his brain. The film is full of action and developed in fast pace, with Bradley Cooper's character experiencing ups and downs while using the experimental NZT in a permanent mouse-and-cat game. My vote is eight.Title (Brazil): ""Sem Limites"" (""Limitless"")",Limitless
4,nogodnomasters,A GREAT SLEEPER,10,8 December 2018,"I was taken in by the opening credits as an outline of a brain turns into a city. I am a big sucker for that microcosm/ macrocosm stuff.Edward has writer's block. He has a book contract for some reason, yet hasn't written a word. His girlfriend, who was his meal ticket leaves him. Bummed out he decides to go live on a bunk bed at Dad's place in New Jersey, but then bumps into his ex-brother-in-law, who is a drug dealer. He offers Edward a pill that increases a person's use of their brain. They can recall everything they have seen or read and can correlate it to increase intelligence. The smarter a person is to begin with, the more data they have to work with. Edward is a smart guy to begin with, so he is able to start his book. The downside is that the pill wears off. Not only does one lose the abilities, but they get a little ADD, and throw up like a heroin addict. Too much of the pill causes a Mr. Hyde type of character including blackouts. Edward's supplier is murdered and Edward finds his stash of pills and a wad of cash.Edward uses his ability to make money on Wall Street. He catches the attention of big time corporations as well as the Russian mafia. He quickly finds out people who take the smart pill eventually die from either taking too much or running out. Edward must try to balance his life.I loved the concept. I loved how they did the drug effect with simple but effective camera tricks. Anyone who has come down off of cocaine, LSD, or heroin knows how Edward feels and he portrays a man coming off drugs very well.I even liked the ending, although the last few minutes should have been stretched out.",Limitless
5,kosmasp,There are limits,8,4 January 2012,"Don't get it twisted: This movie has quite a few flaws. But if you are looking for inconsistencies and illogical behavior, you could do that game with any movie and succeed. This movie however succeeds in being simple and silly enough to be really enjoyable. And maybe this, in addition with Hangover 2 helped Bradley Cooper to become the sexiest man alive 2011 (or whatever he got called, though quite a few Ryan Gosling fans were upset about that result).Back to this movie though. Coopers character has a choice to make and he might not be the most likable character, but you can still care for him. Because after all he's acting and behaving like a human. And even someone who knows it all or has abilities others don't have, does not act always as smart as he is capable of. Plus: What fun would it be, if our main actor would be completely flawless? That's right, it would be a boring movie. And this is anything but boring (unless you hate Coopers guts and can't stand the ""story"" presented here that is of course)",Limitless
6,Sleepin_Dragon,Great fun.,8,3 September 2020,"I sometimes wish I could get more of my brain to work, in this film that's exactly what happens to Eddie Mitra, a pill that makes him use the full capacity of his brain function. Perfect you may think, but with all tablets, there is a side effect.Do not take this film too seriously, it isn't meant to be, it's just a fun ride, all starts off well for Eddie, but as time goes on the problems begin.Bradley Cooper is a favourite form many, and with good reason, he's terrific, and sizzling. He makes the film very watchable.It's impressive still, 8/10.",Limitless
7,gavin6942,An Intelligent Thriller,7,19 February 2013,"A writer (Bradley Cooper) discovers a top-secret drug which bestows him with super human abilities.While I have questioned Bradley Cooper's acting ability, this film is a showcase for his range. He is not the cream of the crop (at least not yet), but he is still better than average given what I saw here. His ability to smoothly transition between schlepp and genius was flawless, and with a little help from a hairstylist he was able to look both parts.The very concept of this film is one that has intrigued me for a long time, at least since I encountered ""Star Trek""'s Data as a teenager. What if we could expand our memories and recall? If not to the level in this film ,at least to some degree? We could solve many of the world's problems. Stock markets? Bah! We could end world hunger. Maybe some day... maybe.Also, DeNiro is excellent here. Much better than he is in ""Silver Linings Playbook"". He was nominated for the wrong film.",Limitless
8,lee_eisenberg,singin' in the brain,8,13 July 2019,"Bradley Cooper has become a household name in the past few years thanks to ""Silver Linings Playbook"", ""American Hustle"" and ""A Star Is Born"". Right before he became a star he appeared in this quirky sci-fi flick about a man who gains the ability to use his entire brain...with a catch. The movie's a little confusing at times due to the jumping around, but overall I found it to be a fun, entertaining flick. I guess that it's a loose adaptation of ""Faust"", as the protagonist does questionable things in his pursuit of wealth. Very much a New York movie. Good one.",Limitless
9,jboothmillard,Limitless,7,24 July 2011,"I was rather keen to see this film when I saw it advertised at the cinema, it looked and sounded worth trying, but by the time I thought about it I was too late, but thank goodness when I got the opportunity I wasn't going to miss it again, from director Neil Burger (The Illusionist). Basically in New York City writer Eddie Morra (Bradley Cooper) who has recently had girlfriend Lindy (Abbie Cornish) leave him, and he is due to turn in a new book to his publisher but he has not even started one yet. One day he comes across drug dealing Vernon Gant (Johnny Whitworth), brother of his ex-wife Melissa (Pushing Daisies' Anna Friel), and he gives him a sample of new experimental intelligence enhancing drug NZT-48, he claims it increases the normal 20% of brain power to the full 100%. Eddie is surprised to find it actually works as he manages to finish his book, and naturally he wants more of these crystal clear pills, and Vernon agrees as long as he runs some errands for him, which he is happy to do. He returns to his apartment however and finds Vernon murdered, so he calls the police, but he is sure they were looking for the NZT-48, so he finds it before anyone else can, and he finds a stash of cash with them too. Using the money and these pills Eddie starts to change his fortunes for the better, as well as learning new skills, such as foreign languages and physical activities in the speedy process the pills provide. Realising he can make a lot of money with his newfound intelligence he gives up writing to instead start trading stocks, starting with borrowing a big amount of cash from Russian mafia thug Gennady (Andrew Howard), and becoming rich very quickly he gets hired by powerful businessman Carl Van Loon (Robert De Niro). Despite also getting back with Lindy, things soon start to go bad when Eddie takes more pills a day, and finds himself being followed by a man in a coat (Tomas Arana), who he may have tried to contact to find out more about the drug from, and side effects start occurring, such as memory loss, lost time and heart palpitations. He suffers NZT-48 hangovers, and seeing news footage about a woman he remembers meeting being dead, he is overly worried he may have been involved without realising, he finds out also ex-wife Melissa dated an addict of the drug, warning him to cut down or die. Cutting down to an acceptable level, and trying to find a reverse drug for NZT-48, Eddie is near to making a deal with Hank Atwood (Richard Bekins) until the man falls ill, and the man in the coat is revealed to be wanting to steal the drugs. Gennady also returns with two thugs trying to kill him, but Eddie manages to kill them first, at one point drinking blood that is filled with the drug influence, and after Atwood dies he joins the man in the coat to steal more of the drug from Eddie's lawyer Brandt (Ned Eisenberg). A year passes and Eddie's book has been published, and he is now running to become Senator, and Carl approaches him, revealing he knows about his NZT-48 drug taking, he offers him an unlimited supply of it, but Eddie refuses saying they have had a permanent effect of intelligence on him and he doesn't need that, but you wonder if that claim is true with the ending. Also starring Robert John Burke as Pierce, Darren Goldstein as Kevin Doyle, Ned Eisenberg as Morris Brandt and T.V. Carpio as Valerie. Cooper does really well in the leading role as the loser who becomes super intelligent with every pill he swallows, De Niro does alright in his slightly minor part, and the supporting cast members do good too. I was very impressed by the effects of the film as wee see the inventive camera illusions and sweep through sequences rushing forwards through the streets and crowds of New York, and POV shots looking around while under the influence of the drugs, I enjoyed the first half more so than the up and down second half, but overall it is certainly an adrenaline filled science-fiction thriller. Very good!",Limitless
10,Tweekums,Giving it 100%,8,18 December 2014,"Life isn't going well for writer Eddie Morra; he hasn't written a single word of his new book, he is a total slob and unsurprisingly his girlfriend has just dumped him. Then he bumps into his ex-brother in law who gives him a pill, called NZT, which promises to enable him to use one hundred present of his brain's capability. He says he has no intention of taking it but inevitably he does and suddenly everything is crystal clear; that evening he sits down and writes several chapters of his book. In the morning he realises he must get more of the pills; he returns to see his ex-brother in law and agrees to run a simple errand for him; when he returns the man is dead and the apartment has been ransacked they killers didn't find the NZT but Eddie does. Taking the pills he soon finishes his book and gets back with his girlfriend. That isn't all though; his ability enables him to play the markets with money borrowed from a Russian gangster. Making a rapid fortune he starts to attract attention; not all of it welcome. Other people want the pills and will kill to get them and he learns that just stopping taking them isn't an option as other users are dead or dying now the supply is over.This is a pretty solid thriller; the pill and its effects are obviously science fiction but it isn't really a sci-fi thriller. Bradley Cooper does a good job as Eddie; it is very much his film; everybody else is very much in a supporting role. Most notably of the supporting cast it Robert DeNiro is great as Carl Van Loon, the financier Eddie gets involved with. Abbie Cornish is fine as his girlfriend although her character doesn't get as much screen time as one might expect. The way the film opens leads us to believe Eddie will meet a sticky end on the pavement below his apartment but that doesn't decrease the tension in scenes set elsewhere. For the most part there is nothing disturbing but one fight does include some wince inducing moments! The effect used to show the effect of the drug is very effective. There are some flaws of course; he took an awfully long time to start trying to establish a new supply of NZT given how smart it made him and was shockingly negligent about dealing with those who were after him still the drama would have suffered if he was too successful. Overall I really enjoyed this; I vaguely recall it getting fairly average revues when it came out but so that proved a nice surprise.",Limitless
11,paul_haakonsen,Is there a pill to make movies more interesting?,4,20 October 2011,"When I went to watch this movie it was without any knowledge about it at all. No idea what it was about, what kind of movie it was, hadn't even seen any trailers. Only seen the poster.And now that I have seen it, I am sitting here thinking 'was that really it?' This movie was somewhat disappointing to me. Sure, it had a great enough storyline, but there was way too much nonsense being shown in various shots and moving camera-styles.Despite having a fairly interesting enough plot, there were times when the movie was limping at a slow pace and it was bordering on being unbearable. But then the movie took a change of pace and picked up in speed, becoming interesting yet again. So I have a somewhat mixed feel about this movie.Bradley Cooper really did a great job in the lead role of Eddie Morra, and he really carried the movie, making it that much better to watch. Sad to say, but Robert De Niro wasn't really shining through in this movie, but of course, he was only having a supporting role.For a thriller, this movie failed to thrill me one bit. And it is not a movie that I will be making a second trip back to watch. Bagged and tagged.",Limitless
12,blanche-2,be prepared to hate the ending - but I won't spoil it,8,27 June 2013,"Bradley Cooper is ""Limitless"" in this 2011 film, also starring Robert DeNiro and Abbie Comish.Cooper plays a loser would-be writer, Eddie Morra, who has a book contract but can't seem to write. In the beginning of the film, we see his girlfriend (Comish) leaving him, after which he runs into his drug-dealing ex-brother-in-law on the street. His brother-in-law claims to be working for a pharmaceutical company now and has gone legit, and has a new drug he gives Eddie to try out. Eddie does, and finds that he is able to completely clean his mess of an apartment, write his book, and mine information in his mind he didn't know he had. After one pill, he wants a stash of them.Morra soon learns there is a downside to this mysterious drug, called NZT, including being stalked by his loan shark, who steals one of the pills from Eddie and wants more.Really fascinating film with good performances by the leads. The ending, though, was a major letdown in a way, almost as if it was rushed. I think, however, that much is left up to the audience.Some people who reviewed this movie on IMDb didn't care for the message, but I think the message really comes from how one interprets the ending.I can't really say much more without spoilers -- it's a film ripe for discussion, it's fun, it's entertaining, Cooper is great eye candy, and it brings up some interesting questions. We don't use our whole brain, but what if we could? Will we ever be able to become transhuman? Should we? It's an old thought, demonstrated in this newish movie. I don't think NZT is the answer.",Limitless
13,tavm,Bradley Cooper lives up to his Limitless potential as its star,8,3 April 2011,"Since it's been a couple of weeks that I watched this movie, here are my thoughts: Bradley Cooper has now come into his own among compelling movie stars with this, his first film in which he's the whole show. He plays an aspiring novelist who has writer's block. That is, until his former brother-in-law provides him with a drug that helps him functions all parts of his brain. So Cooper does lots of things to the point of him skipping through time and being way over his head when some troubling revelations of his doings come up...Though quite entertaining, some of the logic lapses near the end. Still, with such fine supporting turns from, among others, Abbie Cornish, Anna Friel, and the one and only Robert De Niro, not to mention some trippy camera shots, Limitless is a quite entertaining for the 90 or so minutes that pass.",Limitless
14,michaelRokeefe,Being boundless is hazardous.,7,13 September 2011,"Is it Sci-Fi or mystery? Both. Eddie Morra(Bradley Cooper)is an author without a novel; to be exact it is a strain to find inspiration to write just one word. If this isn't enough, Eddie's girlfriend Lindy(Abbie Cornish)dumps him and promises there is no way she will take him back. The hopeless writer runs into an old friend that offers him a powerful cutting-edge pharmaceutical called NZT. Talk about speed on steroids. NZT causes the brain to function at 100 percent and provides the power to understand very complex mathematics. A powerful businessman Carl Van Loon(Robert De Niro)wants to use Eddie's new abilities to share a fortune upon brokering a major corporate merger.

15,sunwarrior13,A Cautionary Tale For Drug Addiction,9,30 September 2014,"Bradley Cooper,Abbie Cornish and Robert DeNiro star in this American thriller entitled,Limitless. The film is about an aspiring author in Eddie Morra,who is suffering from writer's block.Leslie Dixon wrote the screenplay and Neil Burger directed it.Eddie Morra is consistently experiencing a writer's block which does not help him get a break as an aspiring author.But it became helpful when the estranged brother of his ex-wife,Melissa introduced him to a drug called NZT which enabled him to tap into his fullest potential.This motivated him to go into Wall Street and succeeds in the process as he turned a small amount of money into millions.This catches the attention of Carl Van Loon,who asked his help to broker the largest merger in corporate history.Unfortunately,the brutal side effects of the drug takes place and there is the dilemma that there are people after his stash of NZT.With his dwindling supply of the drug,he tries to escape from his enemies who are hunting him down.While the premise could be interesting before watching it,the film actually is full of implausibilities and impossibilities.Added to that,it was also uneven and one may even accuse the plot of being convoluted.But in spite of it,it was definitely entertaining as well as appealing.Credit Bradley Cooper and Robert De Niro for a fantastic performance.Added to that,it has a lot of great special effects that lovers of CGI movies will surely enjoy.As far as the theme of the movie is concerned,it also serves as a great cautionary tale for drug addiction and how not to overuse drugs especially those that claim to help self-enhancement of certain abilities which the movie did probably just right in its attempt to be original in terms of story and screenplay.",Limitless
16,hitchcockthelegend,A drug for people who wanted to me more anal retentive.,6,11 September 2011,"Limitless is directed by Neil Burger and adapted to screenplay by Leslie Dixon from The Dark Fields written by Alan Glynn. It stars Bradley Cooper, Abbie Cornish and Robert De Niro. Music is by Paul Leonard-Morgan and cinematography by Jo Willems. Plot has Cooper has a struggling writer who upon discovering a top-secret drug, finds he has enhanced his brain usage by 80%. All well and good in the beginning as his stock rises considerably and he's suddenly the in demand man, both at work and play. But success comes at a cost, and now he has others interested in the drug tooBonkers daft of course, but still a good time to be had with it if you can forgive the gaping plot holes, the cretinous decisions made by Cooper's protagonist and a sleepy last third. Film looks real nice courtesy of Willems sci-fi alike saturated tints, while Burger shows some style with visual flourishes and nifty camera zooms. Cooper makes for a solid protagonist, and it's good to see De Niro at least showing not all his best form has deserted him. But Cornish as the girlfriend is badly underused, and Anna Friel serves only as a cameo plot device. Screenplay is a touch bold, with its morally dubious bent, but again this only leads to disappointment as the film begins to feel like an overplayed record that winds down to a finale that's rather tepid. After being asked to wait and wonder how this is going to pan out for Cooper, it just isn't the fanfare/thrill/cheek that the best parts of the film promised.It's good fun when it's on form and a decent enough night in as a rental, but it uses only 1% of its brain whilst hardly troubling your own grey matter. 6/10",Limitless
17,Theo Robertson,Hyper-Kinetic Thriller That's Intriguing But Has A Flawed Logic,6,29 June 2013,Author Eddie Morra is suffering writer's block . Meeting drug dealer Vernon Gant he tries out a new synthetic drug NZT which increases Eddie's mental powers . Wanting another supply of NZT Eddie turns up at Vernon's flat and finds him dead Director Neil Burger knows how to grab an audience and pull them in to a movie . LIMITLESS has one of the most hypnotic in your face mindbending openings I've seen in a film for a very long time . The editing by Tracy Adams and Naomi Geraghty along with the cinematography by Jo Williems and most effectively the grunge cum techno hypno beat all conspire to make the audience think they'll be watching a truly unforgettable film . Manipulative visual film making ? Possible . Owes a lot to Danny Boyle and David Fincher ? Certainly . Will the film be able to sustain these great early sequences ? Well we are talking Hollywood movies here aren't we ? From a continuity point of view LIMITLESS is slightly guilty of if not cheating then certainly being guilty of being vague as to the power of NZT . Supposedly it increases IQ to unimaginable potential where Eddie effectively knows everything . This is nonsensical to say the least . IQ merely means you posses a high level of intelligence which can be tested by standardised tests . Certainly someone with a very high IQ would be good at things such as science but that's entirely different from possessing knowledge but as the story progresses Eddie seems to continually know everything . Intelligence is different from intellect which is something screenwriter Leslie Dixon seems to have euphemistically mixed up None of this really matters in the first half because as I've said the language of cinema on a visual level is done so very well and it's easy to forgive any minor flaws if it's to set up a great story . I did mention Danny Boyle and the most vocal problem with a Boyle film is that the second half can't sustain the momentum of the first half and we see the same problem with Neil Burger . The rather mundane plot then focuses on some mobsters wanting to get their hands on NZT from Eddie and they won't stop at anything . As everyone has complained about this certainly a film of two halves and I agree,Limitless

19,CinemaSerf,Clever sci-fi concept thriller.,7,27 June 2020,"Bradley Cooper (""Eddie Morra"") is a struggling author who takes the experimental drug ""AZT"" that allows him to fully utilise his brain. This renders him extremely sharp and focused, his senses honed beyond anything he could have imagined - and he puts these new skills to good use setting out to make himself a fortune. In so doing, however, he attract the attention of the evil Robert de Niro (""Carl Van Loon"") who once he has cottoned on to what it is that gives ""Morra"" his super-power, determines to get it at all costs. With his stash of pills running low, we've now got a great little cat and mouse chase as he tries to stay alive long enough to outwit the heavies in pursuit. Cooper is quite engaging, but the rest - including a rather wooden De Niro - are all just a bit flat.

20,zardoz-13,A Move That Thinks Outside of the Box!,9,26 March 2011,"Scientists have been assuring us for years that we use only about 10 to 20 per cent of our brain. What if you could mobilize more than 80 per cent of your mind to solve your problems? Would you be happier? More productive? ""The Illusionist"" director Neil Burger and ""Mrs. Doubtfire"" scenarist Leslie Dixon explore this 'what if' premise in witty but speculative saga ""Limitless,"" based on Irish novelist Alan Glynn's 2001 techno-thriller ""The Dark Fields."" Some of the details have changed during the transition from page to screen, but the imaginative plot remains reasonably intact. When an aspiring novelist afflicted with writer's block resorts to an experimental opiate—kind of like Adderall--that enables him to not only finish his novel ahead of time but also emerge as a savant of sorts, he discovers addiction may be the least of his woes. This out-of-the- ordinary futuristic murder mystery about a slacker who learns that the sky is no longer the limit generates considerable charisma throughout its nimble 104 minutes because leading man Bradley Cooper makes the hero so sympathetic despite his sardonic personality. A couple of movies about protagonists who acquired higher brain power through either pharmaceuticals or surgery have been made, including ""The Lawnmower Man"" (1992) with Pierce Brosnan and ""Charly"" (1968) with Cliff Robertson. In both movies, the protagonists were mentally challenged, but the ""Limitless"" leading man isn't handicapped. Instead, he is a hopeless procrastinator who lacks the ability to focus his energy and efforts to complete tasks. The odyssey that our hero embarks on puts ""Limitless"" in the same offbeat category as the Brad Pitt & Edward Norton movie ""Fight Club"" with its innovation use of computer generated imagery. Burger uses the CGI here primarily to reflect the paranoid-inducing impact of the drug, but he doesn't flaunt it to the extremes of most contemporary melodramas.""Limitless"" opens with our protagonist dramatically poised on the ledge of his ultra-high-rise Manhattan apartment as he contemplates performing a header into the street hundreds of feet below. A group of Neanderthal thugs are trying to break down the door to his super-secure apartment because he has something that they want. They are prepared to kill him without a qualm and he can do nothing to stop them. Eddie Mora (Bradley Cooper of ""The Hangover"") takes a jaundiced view of his predicament and then he explains how he wound up in this tight spot as ""Limitless"" shifts gears into flashback mode. In the beginning, Eddie was an author who landed a book contract. Unfortunately, he hasn't been able to conjure up a single sentence. No matter how long he stares at his computer, he cannot get his creative juices to flow. Eddie's girlfriend Lindy (Abbie Cornish of ""Sucker Punch"") decides that she would be better off without him and they split. Not only does she get a better job, but also she has grown tired of footing their bills. Our unhappy protagonist is wandering the streets when he runs into his former brother-in-law, Vernon (Johnny Whitworth of ""Empire Records""), and they grab a drink at a bar. Vernon tells Eddie that he is no longer a small potatoes drug dealer. Indeed, he works for a pharmaceutical firm that has developed an $800-a-pop miracle pill called NZT-84. Vernon adds that the drug is on the verge of receiving FDA approval. Initially, Eddie is leery of Vernon's hype, but he decides to try it. Presto! Eddie polishes off his book and his prose blows his editor's mind. Eddie asks Vernon for some more, but somebody kills him before our hero can get the pills. Nevertheless, Eddie finds Vernon's stash, borrows thousands from a Russian mobster, Gennady (Andrew Howard of ""Revolver"") and parlays it into an overnight fortune. Eddie's exploits bring him to the attention of a legendary Wall Street tycoon, Carl Van Loon (Robert De Niro of ""Goodfellas""), and our hero helps him acquire even more millions. Eddie even wins back Lindy, but he cannot get the Russian off his back. The Russian gets a taste of the drug and wants more. Moreover, another mysterious man is tailing Eddie everywhere, and this ruffian doesn't mind wielding a knife to get what he wants. Suddenly, everything good that happened to Eddie turns really bad.""Limitless"" describes the exciting arc that Eddie traverses in his journey from 'nobody' status to 'somebody' status. Typically, this kind of materialistic movie degenerates into a heavy-handed Faustian morality play. In other words, the hero experiences a meteoric rise, only to suffer the consequences of a tragic downfall. The downfall occurs because he relinquishes his power to control his destiny. Meaning, at some point, he sells out for the short term and pays for it with his life in the long term. John Travolta made a similar movie, ""Phenomenon"" (1996), where he manifested mental powers beyond anything he had experienced. The toll that these powers exacted ended up killing him. He was no more irresponsible than the ""Limitless"" hero. Nevertheless, Hollywood rules dictated that the Travolta had to perish. The people who made ""Limitless"" don't subscribe to this mentality. Bradley Cooper's heroic character fares much better that the John Travolta character. Although our hero boasts mental powers beyond anything that anybody else has, Eddie refuses to abuse his gift and ""Limitless"" allows him to reap the rewards. Indeed, he winds up enjoying the last laugh on villainous Robert De Niro. Mind you, this represents De Niro's best work since ""The Score"" in 2001. Happily, Burger and Dixon use Eddie's rambling voice-over commentary to deliver lots of humor, a technique that only Martin Scorsese usually gets away with in his mafia movies. Burger stages a bravura fight scene and intercuts it with footage of martial arts superstar Bruce Lee. Altogether, ""Limitless"" qualifies as a startlingly original film about our prescriptive, self-medicating society that ventures where most Hollywood movies dare not.",Limitless

23,neil-476,Unusual and enjoyable,9,1 April 2011,"Bradley Cooper is Eddie Morra, a down-at-heel writer: despite having received an advance for his book, he hasn't written a word. He lives in apathetic squalor and his girlfriend is on the point of dumping him. Then he bumps into his ex-wife's brother who offers him a tablet - legal, apparently - which will unlock access to the 90% of his brain which isn't normally used. Suddenly Eddie is able to finish his book, read the markets and make money, learn languages overnight, and become a general wunderkind. However, there is a price to be paid. More precisely, there are several prices to be paid.Having seen the trailer for Limitless a number of times, I thought I had a reasonable idea of what I was in for. But, while I was in the same general area, I was in for a quite a lot of surprises (for one thing, the trailer connects audio and images which don't belong together in the movie).This film was a lot of fun. It had a really good story which didn't always go in the direction you expected it to. And, while unlocking 90% of the brain's potential also seemed to give Eddie other powers - speed, vision, athleticism etc.), I never had too much trouble accepting that this was reasonable. All the cast played well and had fun. The direction was striking without being so flamboyant as to be overpowering.

24,ferguson-6,"Crystal Clear, Except when it's not",5,20 March 2011,"Greetings again from the darkness. First, I absolutely love this premise. The idea that, by taking a pill, we can simultaneously access all parts of our brain and process information at hyper-speed is fascinating, and a terrific idea for a movie. As it turns out, that terrific premise loses much luster when the center of action is a egomaniacal, smirking doofus played by a strutting Bradley Cooper.The set-up portion of the film is fairly interesting. Cooper plays a stone-walled loser of a writer whose career-minded girlfriend (Abbie Cornish) wisely dumps him as he offers up very little in self-defense. A seemingly random street meet of his ex-brother in law leads Cooper to a whole new world brought on by the magic of NZT. He quickly realizes he can recall every detail he has ever seen or read and he process information quickly and clearly. He finishes his book and learns multiple languages, plays the piano, etc etc.The film takes a wrong turn when he realizes his ability comes in handy in the stock market, as well as blackjack. But obviously if you were in this situation, the first thing you would do is contact a Russian loan shark and take out a giant loan ... and then forget to pay it back. What? You wouldn't? Well then, don't expect to have a movie made about your life.Director Neil Burger (The Illusionist) brings a wonderful visual touch to Cooper's mind and an awesome telescoping zoom rush through the streets of NYC. That was actually my favorite part of the film.The film misses quite a few opportunities to be as smart as Cooper's character is supposed to be. Either the Russian loan shark or the ultra-rich businessman played by Robert DeNiro could have led to Faustian themes that would have provided endless opportunities. Instead, we don't even get a real battle of wits between the parties. Quite a disappointment.Overall, the film is entertaining enough, but a letdown over what should have been. Watching Cooper strut and DeNiro sleepwalk are not enough for me as a movie goer.",Limitless

That all vanishes the day an old friend introduces Eddie to NZT, a designer pharmaceutical that makes him laser focused and more confident than any man alive.Now on an NZT-fuelled odyssey, everything Eddie's read, heard or seen is instantly organised and available to him.

The clever thing about this movie is that every time a pill is taken, the bleaching effect of the hue turns more deeper, and really gives the audience a more product effect of the pills possibilities.But although the concept is sound, a few things in the film are pointless. The loan shark sub plot feels out of place, and feels like it was included so it could do that over done element of having the first reel of the film the beginning of the final act, and Friel and De Niro are wasted.But this is Coopers film, and the macguffin element works wonders for the most part of the film, and then things get a little too clever for it's own good, until the very overblown and frankly out of place ending.It's a fun movie though, not for clever people like one user has stated, it's one of those sci fi movies that comes around once in a while, and just lets the audience enjoy the plausibility.Well worth watching.",Limitless

The dude can't act worth a crap, but even if he could, he couldn't save the film from such an enormously stupid screenplay. It's about a dunderhead (Cooper) who is given a magic clear pill by his ex-brother-in-law that allows him to use his full brain capacity. The pill makes him so smart that he's able to play the stock market and get rich quick - of course, he's so smart that the way he gets funding to play the stock market is by borrowing from the Russian mafia. Because that's what smart people would do. Later in the film, Cooper's girlfriend (Abbie Cornish, whose career should be going much better than it is - she stars in two of the worst films of the year, this and Sucker Punch) takes the pill and decides to use an eight year old girl with ice skates as a weapon. The thing is, the writers of this film (and the original novel; this was based on a friggin' novel!) are so dumb they don't have any clue how a smart person would think, so they just come up with whatever is in their dumbass heads and put it in the movie.

The director's flow, style, mixed with the script's plot devices of blackouts, different personalities with the character, and the film's character's self-realization about himself creates a modern day version of Fight Club. Both movies show a protagonist who hates his current life and needs a change. Furthermore, both stories take off when the protagonist meets a sleazy antagonist character. Instead of the destruction of the main character, both Limitless and Fight club create a liberated protagonist. Is the protagonist liberated? One will not know unless there is a part two.

28,DICK STEEL,A Nutshell Review: Limitless,8,7 April 2011,"The film is based on a sexy premise of having the ability to unlock the full potential of one's brain matter, and think about it, the sheer mental prowess available to be tapped on to maximize benefits in almost everything you do. Would you do whatever it takes to have this at your disposal, even if it means becoming a drug junkie, addicted to a clear pill and of course addicted to the feeling of superiority that comes along with the turf?For Eddie Morra (Bradley Cooper), a chance encounter with a drug pushing brother in law Vernon (Johnny Whitworth) meant an opportunity to go for broke with the offer of a pill that can dramatically change one's life for the better. Soon Eddie finds himself being able to think clearly, plan multiple steps ahead in what he wants to achieve out of life, from financial stability to getting his relationship with Lindy (Abbie Cornish) back on track, to just about possessing that Midas touch to being successful, recognized, and earning the kind of respect from his peers that his sad little existence never thought was remotely possible.But the best things in life don't come easy, and Limitless is in two minds to being a cautionary tale about drug abuse and the over reliance of medication to get through one's day, or being adamant against that to promote that pill popping is indeed a wondrous shortcut to all things beautiful. In fact it walked on ambiguity for the most parts, though the engaging narrative by Leslie Dixon adapting Alan Glynn's novel keeps that at the back of your mind as you follow the adventures of Eddie Morra making it through obstacles every step of the way, especially when he so decides to build a nest egg before his supply goes out.Director Neil Burger fused a number of special effects to the film, whose editing between the trippy scenes and the real world was flawlessly mesmerizing, as you can imagine just how addictive it could actually be if it was to be presented in an IMAX 3D format, right from the opening credits scene. What turned out to be slightly weak was the presentation of the side effects of NZT-48, which was the losing track of time through multiple encounters with self, since it didn't employ the best use of visual effects to portray just that, and having the narrative conveniently forget and to switch focus to certain death, probably sounded a death knell that this was a subplot best left abandoned, rather than to exploit the limitations of a sustained use or abuse of a shady substance.Bradley Cooper is slowly but surely turning into a major leading star who will probably be able to soon marquee a film on his own. He plays the writer turned suave Wall Street raider with aplomb, and portrays both the zeros about being an addict, and the better versions of his character convincingly, being a man who on one hand builds up a wealth of knowledge and analytical skills through his unfair advantage, and on the other still shows a certain vulnerability stemming from being overly confident with an air of invincibility. Adversary comes in the form of a tycoon in Carl Van Loon (Robert De Niro), whose power and threats do not suffer fools, and De Niro still shows he's got it in him to play a nasty badass after a string of comedic appearances. The best scene in the film, hands down, belongs to the repartee between Eddie and Carl in the final act, at least up until the abrupt mention of a deus ex machina type revelation that exalts the merits of a continued succumbing to an addiction.The story does take some unexpected turn of events to keep things fresh rather than to make Eddie Morra a one man Superman, and it builds on his conscience to break his cycle and to do the right thing. Sometimes it's easier said than done especially if what's wrong actually becomes a necessary evil and a crutch to continue sustaining a lifestyle of one's choosing. A little bit dark in treatment, but still recommended fare.",Limitless

He climbs up in the world pretty fast, so people notice and try to stop him, naturally. The way they do it and how he handles them is pretty hard to swallow, but then again, if you were really smart you wouldn't use your own person and name to become famous in stock trading. You would just make money, discreetly.The acting is OK, I would say the Bradley Cooper's acting makes the film more than the subject (or the horrible soundtrack).

31,DKosty123,Smart Pill Conquers Reality,7,25 March 2011,"The best thing about this film is the pacing. It does not stick around too long & keeps the action moving. The cast does a good job. Robert De Niro is good in a supporting role. Bradley Cooper carries most of the load including narration. Abbie Cornish is the main love interest. The rest of the roles get smaller in support of these. Neil Burger's direction is fast & crisp.Where last years Inception dealt with layers of dreams, this one centers on one dream - a pill which makes you smarter so you can use your entire brain. While writing a novel which Coopers character does is a noble thing to do with that ability, I am not so sure that being able to use my entire brain that I would do it for a couple of items.Scoring day trading on the stock market is a good use for being smart? It would do wonders for the US Government budget when the IRS collects Taxes from this man (along with the Gambling revenue he owes taxes on). Still, it seems to me the intellect could be put to better uses.The film presents an interesting theory that being smart can get Eddie Morra into bed with women. Perhaps that would be true if the pill can help you read that person's mind. Being smarter can make you into a better fighter? In theory it could help, but without muscles & reflexes it takes more than thinking to make it through a fight.Still, you have to put reality into the ticket taker at the theater door when you see this one. It employs the same type of flashback format that I saw in Mission Impossible 2 in that it starts near the end, goes back to the beginning, and then winds past the flashback.It is a single dream, but at least it is effective. I didn't want to think too much on a Friday night after a tough week anyhow.",Limitless
32,KineticSeoul,Starts out a bit engaging but loses it and becomes dull,5,24 June 2011,"Maybe it's because I was expecting more from this movie cause I personally didn't find this movie to be all that great. The premise may seem cool and actually that is basically all it's going for this movie. It's about a pill that allows people to use 100% of there brain which can make anyone that uses it to become a super genius. But like always there are conflicts that go with it. So yeah the premise is kinda cool, but the thing is, although the movie starts out engaging it starts to get dull later on. The movie is simply generic for the most part and really predictable. The direction is also very unimaginative and nothing all that cool happens. Although the movie revolves around a genius for the most part. Maybe it tries to go in a realistic approach but it was still pretty darn dull. I liked the fast pacing of this movie but there are sacrifices since the movie goes from one point to another point without hardly explaining and the characters are not very developed as well. I also agree with some of the reviewers when it comes to the moral of this movie, especially when it comes to the ending. This movie is at best a rental and nothing more.5/10",Limitless
33,Hellmant,'LIMITLESS' definitely has limits but still entertaining.,6,8 April 2011,"'LIMITLESS': Three Stars (Out of Five) Bradley Cooper has came a long way from TV's 'ALIAS'. Here he headlines his first major motion picture, taking over a role once filled by Shia LaBeouf (who backed out of the film after hurting his arm in an automobile accident). A film with Robert De Niro playing a supporting player! As a whole the movie is entertaining but nothing great and Cooper's leading man performance is adequate but not spectacular. I think he's better in ensemble pieces like 'THE HANGOVER' and 'THE A-TEAM'. The film tells the story of a down on his luck writer who takes a secret drug which enhances the level his brain is able to function at, making him 'super smart'. It's directed by Neil Burger and written by Leslie Dixon (based on the book 'The Dark Fields' by Alan Glynn).Cooper plays Eddie Morra, a New York City writer who's recently been dumped by his girlfriend (Abbie Cornish, who has also recently been seen co-starring in 'SUCKER PUNCH'). He's struggling to meet a deadline for a book he's been contracted to write when he stumbles upon his ex brother-in-law (Johnny Whitworth) who offers him a free sample of an unknown pharmaceutical drug called NZT. The drug provides him the ability to use a hundred percent of his brain's full capacity, as opposed to the supposed normal twenty percent, and makes him super confident. When he comes across a full stash of the drug he begins succeeding at everything he had always dreamed of. Then the side effects kick in and he discovers there are others after the drug as well that will stop at no cost to get a hold of it.The movie has an interesting premise and is played out at an amusing pace but it's full of holes and moral detachment. Without giving away too much I'll just say that if you stop to think about many details in the story they don't really make sense. There's also several things the main character does in the film that are highly morally questionable yet they're portrayed as if they're heroic actions. I also think Cooper isn't quite cut out to carry a film like this and makes the character even a little less likable. With all it's flaws the movie is still somewhat interesting and intriguing and definitely entertaining.

35,Lejink,On-limits,5,18 February 2012,"A pounding and indeed relentless up-to-the-minute thriller with its own unique insight into the burn-out behind high-fliers in the finance world; apparently it's all due to a new, unofficially available pill which frees the mind. For Bradley Cooper's schmucky-loser, it becomes a life-changing revelation, making him immediately brilliant in business, an expert in self-defence and of course, a hit with the ladies. Cue lots of directorial devices, such as deep-perspective tracking shots, cut-up scenes and interspersing dialogue. It's a good premise for a sci-fi thriller and the first hour is great as Cooper embarks on his rags to riches trip, discovering the potency of the drug in his everyday life.Unfortunately, it gets too silly from there on as he gets involved with a Slavic gangster who wants in on the act taking the last third into sub-Terminator territory with too much violence and gore and letting down the promise of what had gone before. Cooper is good in what is basically a split-personality role, half strung-out waster, half suited and booted fast-talking whizz-kid. Robert DeNiro does his usual professional job as the biggest shark in the pool, reining in any Pacino-like excess and playing it straight. More could have been made of the slightly underwritten female parts which reaches some sort of nadir when Cooper's wife pops a pill to become Sigourney Weaver long enough to escape the bad guy in a tight spot.In the final reckoning, if the writer and director had avoided the predilection for mindless violence, a modern-day parable about the excesses of capitalism albeit mixed up with a sci-fi and thriller ethos was within reach, but it really let itself down by pandering to the body-count requirement of teenagers who I guess put bums on seats.",Limitless
36,wellthatswhatithinkanyway,A wasted opportunity of a film that doesn't develop the right way,4,9 April 2011,"STAR RATING: ***** Saturday Night **** Friday Night *** Friday Morning ** Sunday Night * Monday Morning Scruffy looking out of work writer Eddie Morra (Bradley Cooper) takes his girlfriend Lindy (Abbie Cornish) giving him the boot as the final straw in his life heading down the pan. Just when he thinks things can't get any worse, his old brother in law hands him a new designer drug that allegedly has the power to enhance his abilities to their fullest.

Living his life to the max, Eddie sees a chance to commercialise on his discovery with Carl Van Loon (Robert De Niro) a powerful businessman who sees potential. But when the not so lovely side effects kick in, Eddie finds his world thrust into turmoil.Hollywood is a place where original ideas are running increasingly scarce in the recession era, where only re-makes and sequels to age old franchise films appear to be springing up. So it's always encouraging, in one way or another, for a film like Limitless to spring up, with producers taking a gamble on a new idea that could work wonders. So it's all the more upsetting when the result is something so far fetched, confused and implausible, a film that saunters around without much direction and fails to develop into a film as a whole. It's slick and glossy enough, and the zooming camera moments would give a ride at Alton Towers a run for it's money. But there's really not much more to it than this, with give or take lead performances from Cooper and De Niro, who takes an eternity to make his presence in the film but still fails to give it any extra weight or gravitas, and an enhanced sense that it's on to something special when really it's anything but. **",Limitless
37,dromasca,stretching to the limits,6,7 May 2012,"One of the latest films I saw before 'Limitless' was 'The Sorcerer's Apprentice'. The two share at least one line in which the supernatural capabilities of the hero are explained by his making used of 100% of his brain capabilities, while us, the rest of the mortals scarcely use 10% or 20%. In this movie the explanation is a memory enhancement drug, in the other one magic but is there a difference? Let us not forget that the best film director Neil Burger has on record (better than this one) was 'The Illusionist'. This director probably does believe in magic.What are the effects of the drug on our hero which seems to be doomed to be an eternal loser? They turn him into a super-smart analyzer and winner into the stock market, a heart-breaker speaking all languages immigrant waiters speak, but they also put him in trouble with the Mafia and maybe - we just never know - turn him into a murderer. Bradley Cooper with the help of some special effects that make his eyes more blue than deep sea when under influence does a fairly good job which is not pushed into the corner even by Robert De Niro in another of these roles that do not do too much good to his filmography but may round corners to his bank account.The film does work eventually especially if concerns about morality and credibility are pushed aside. If at some point in time one may suspect that the story will make the case about drugs not really improving life or eventually asking the payback for their effect some disappointment may be in the waiting. Limitless is fair entertainment based on an interesting premises, the kind of movies we remember the idea but not the details soon after we finished the viewing.",Limitless

For the most part, the filmmakers actually made good use of the unusual plot and made a good, interesting film out of it. I liked the fact that this film was not filmed in the traditional sense.

41,secondtake,A clever film that plays out the possibilities of its simple mind-expanding premise,8,4 December 2011,"Limitless (2011)A sharp, twisting, wishful film, well done and intriguing. If you can throw this in with other mind-bending fantasy films with tinges of sci-fi reality like ""Eternal Sunshine of the Everlasting Mind"" or ""Momento"" you'll see both its strengths and intentions and maybe how it falls a little short of those rather startling and full-blooded films.The idea here is simple--a pill makes you use your brain to its full capacity, so you can learn and perform at astonishing levels. But this also wears you down physically and chemically, so that you not only get hooked on increasing doses but start to have side effects. But when you are on the pills, you do things that the rest of the world notices.So our leading man played by Bradley Cooper (normally a secondary actor) takes it on. What layers it up is the reasonable idea that you can't keep this kind of power to yourself, and some people will go to incredible extremes to have and control this power. If this sounds a bit like heroin--or maybe some kind of heroin/ecstasy/cocaine mixture that gives you the best of everything without killing you first--it should. The parallels to all kinds of illegal drugs are everywhere, promising one thing and leading to another.There are some very nice filming techniques going on here--some tracking shots that go on for blocks in fast motion (probably contrived with CGI), some brief distortions (when the drug kicks in), and lots of careful use of filters on the lens (the world takes on a saturated golden hue when under the influence, and is otherwise believably gray). All of this sucks you in, consciously or otherwise. And the events take you one step to the next.It's a little weird that this is all slightly un-affecting in the end, especially at the very end, when there is one last shift of trajectory that is sudden and a bit unconvincing. I didn't quite feel for the leading character so much as I was interested. One problem might actually be over-explaining the situation, and the main reason for this is voice-over narration, a lot of it. The main character keeps coming in to explain things that we kind of already knew, and certainly sensed. Or would have figured out a few minutes later, and when we get to that next scene and see what he has just explained, it's a bit dull. It's basically like repeating himself repeatedly. See?

Not only does the pill boost his brain power and stamina, it also makes him an expert on anything he has read or seen since birth. It's a silly premise that has the potential for a good comedy, but doesn't really work as drama. Given that Cooper proceeds to take the pills despite the dangerous side effects, the story could have worked along the theme of a Faustian bargain. However, the film is not up to the challenge. The filmmakers are unsure of where to go, and the story just rambles rather aimlessly, culminating in an unsatisfying ending.",Limitless
46,The-Sarkologist,"When you discover the wonder drug, you simply cannot get enough of it.",4,5 November 2011,"I was at my friend's house and he decided that he would put this movie on to watch. The movie didn't ring a bell, so I checked out IMDb and the little blurb was that the main character is given superpowers after taking a drug. I think this is not necessarily the theme, or plot, of the movie, but it comes close. The reason I say this is that the main character (Eddie) is an out of work writer who has just lost his high flying girlfriend, and while he is down in the dumps, an old friend (and drug dealer) of his approaches him and offers him this new wonder drug, which he reluctantly takes.To be honest this isn't a film about superheros this is a film about drugs and about how we become addicted to drugs, and when I am talking about drugs I am not talking about the drugs that we buy off the black market, but rather about anything that we give ourselves over to as a crutch so that we may not only feel good about ourselves but to also give us confidence to do what otherwise we do not believe we are able to do. Some people may call these things drugs, others will call them idols.Anyway this drug is a drug that is said to clear the mind and to enable one to become incredibly smarter. However the problem is not so much the drug but the supply. First of all the drug does not last forever, and as with all drugs, when the supply is removed then the come down arrives, and while when one is under the influence of the drug, they feel much more than themselves, when the drug begin s to wear off, they begin to feel much less than themselves. What goes up must come down, and the higher you fly the harder you crash.Not only that, but the more drug that you have the more that you need. The body begins to become used to the drug, so when you take it, you must then have more to get the same effect that you had when you first had the drug. Then there is the case when you have too much of it and you begin to lose yourself, and you then wake up, with a hangover, wondering where you were and what you had done the night before. This movie explores all of these issues with this wonder drug.Obviously, there is then the final point, and that is that the experiment breaks free of the creator. This movie, while ending with the death of the bad guy, is all about Eddie trying to get more of the drug. He has it the first time, and comes back for more, but his dealer has been killed. He is lucky though because it turns out that the people who killed him want the drugs, but could not find it, though he does. While he has the drugs, everything goes fine, but things begin to fall apart once the drugs begin to run out. However, at the end, it appears that he is able to not only get more, but to be able to produce more, or so it seems. This drug does not destroy the person, but rather makes them into something much more than they were at first, it is only when the drug is removed that the self-destructive phase comes about.In many cases with the drugs that we know, it is not being under the influence of the drugs that creates a bad person, but rather when they have withdrawn from the drug and must have more. This is not necessarily the case with alcohol, but it is the case with many of the other drugs. While on the drugs, the person is fine, but when the person comes off and starts to have the craving for more, that is when the violence and the bad things happen. It is also the case that the person has now come under the control of their supplier. They must have the drug and the supplier has the drug, and thus there is control. Obviously some users get more violent and intimidating however it is always the question of demand and supply, while you demand the drug from the supplier, whether you like it or not, the supplier has power over you.I guess that I have now travelled around the world of drugs, and while we may think of things like cocaine, heroin, and other drugs, there is more to the world of drugs (or idols) than these illegal pharmaceuticals. Drugs are little more than idols, and anything that dominates your heart is an idol. Anything that you crave more of with a desire of fulfilment, whether it be wealth or a job or a family, is a drug, the more that we have the more we crave, and the more we crave the more enslaved we become.",Limitless

The film offers an interesting concept and message and as the film goes, we see the development and balance as the film progresses. Starts with a relatively slow start then once the film settles in becomes an interesting watch. The film was relatively a decent hit, making $161 million on a $27 million budget, but wonders as to why a sequel never occurred (instead they made a brief tv series years later)Overall the plot clips along with camera tricks that mirror Eddie's increasingly confused state. Bradley Cooper's knack for slipping from cocksure to self-assured is a delight to watch. His performance, the kinetic energy of the direction by Neil Burger, and a looming sense of dread over the physical and mental toll taken by operating at such a high pitch of efficiency buoy the proceedings along. The plot, it's clever, making a fine distinction between being smart and being savvy, and then hinging the outcome on it without giving too much away in the process.",Limitless

52,Movie_Muse_Reviews,"A thrilling ride with a slight crash, but well executed",6,19 July 2011,"If humans can only access 20 percent of their brains normally and 100 percent while on NZT, the ""Limitless"" drug of choice, then I would say screenwriter Leslie Dixon and director Neil Burger probably access somewhere around 70 percent of their creative power with regards to bringing Alan Glynn's novel to the big screen. All far-fetched concept stories have their side effects, but the true winners avoid the crash. ""Limitless"" takes its audience on a thrill ride through the realm of possibility and gleefully entertains, but some sobering second-act elements kill off a bit of the joy.Bradley Cooper ascends to full-fledged leading man status as Eddie Morra, a disheveled writer stuck in a rut who receives a little round miracle from an old acquaintance. This pill multiplies brain function exponentially, increasing his capacity for knowledge and the speed with which he acquires it. He can learn entire languages within hours, problem-solve instantaneously, recall long-discarded insignificant details from his memory and even finishes his book in the first night. But as we all learned in D.A.R.E., all drug use has its consequences.Eddie's consequent meteoric rise to wealth, prestige and even fame is a fun time. He even scores his girlfriend (Abbie Cornish) back. Although the degree to which he outsmarts and impresses everyone is a total joke from a believability perspective, between Burger, Dixon and Cooper, we get a hard sell. The script paces well and uses narration effectively to help us enter Eddie's head and Burger employs a great deal of visual techniques — even if excessive at times — to mimic the effects of the drug, not unlike Darren Aronofsky's work on ""Requiem for a Dream,"" just less stomach-churning.Burger and cinematographer Jo Willems change exposure levels, color brightness and countless other techniques to create a distinction between when Eddie is on versus off NZT so that we feel that transition with him to an extent. Cooper as an actor fully captures that for us as well. I suppose if there's anything he learned to do well from ""The Hangover,"" it was act convincingly hung over or experiencing withdrawal.Truthfully, Cooper's the show here. Although they have scenes of influence, Cornish and Robert De Niro (as a business bigwig who employs Eddie to orchestrate a merger) have little bearing on the story. At one point it seem Cornish's Lindy will emerge as a prominent character, but this surprisingly subsides.Muddling matters more are the varying forces of antagonism in the film: a lender who gets hooked on the drug who keeps coming after Eddie, a man following him and of course the nasty side effects of the drug that Eddie soon uncovers. Things are not as intricately connected as we're inclined to believe, which is mostly what derails the film in the end. The other factor would be a total lack of a realistic message, or any message for that matter.Serving as executive producer, Cooper shows a flare for the business here. He's put the right pieces in place to make a fun concept movie work in addition to finding a leading role that fits his abilities. The film's better-than-expected box-office business also suggests he's growing quite popular. It's almost the kind of prowess you'd have to manufacture  wait, could it be?~Steven CVisit my site at http://moviemusereviews.com",Limitless

54,Turfseer,"Exciting and entertaining sci-fi-like thriller, undone by disappointing Hollywood-like ending",6,3 June 2013,"'Limitless' is one of those entertaining thrillers that (despite its ill-conceived ending), will appeal to the majority of ordinary males who have fantasies of becoming the kind of male women seem to automatically gravitate to: the alpha male. Indeed, the film's protagonist, Eddie Morra, the down and out novelist played by Bradley Cooper, represents an exaggerated version of the kind of situation, the average guy finds himself in, on a daily basis.While most guys aren't down to their last buck like Morra, they can certainly can identify with his great dissatisfaction in the inability to achieve success in a career. It's not like Morra is some bum off the street: he's got an agent but has writer's block; the average guy can relate to Morra's inability to reach his potential. The same applies to women: Morra does have a very good-looking girlfriend, Lindy—but because he doesn't reach his potential and ends up projecting a negative image, she has no guilt feelings about dumping him.'Limitless' allows the average male to indulge in the fantasy of becoming an instant alpha male without developing the skills. When Eddie runs into his ex-brother-in-law who gives him the illegal medication, 'NZT', we're ready to break into Act 2 and watch how Eddie is transformed. Perhaps the best scene in the movie is when Eddie must turn his brow-beating landlady around after she constantly screams at him for not paying his rent. Instead of adopting the motivational social skills of the ordinary schlub, the NZT allows Eddie to tap his full cognitive potential. Not only does he help the landlady with her paper for law school but also ends up bedding her without even trying.A montage with voice-over allows us to see what else Eddie accomplishes 'under the influence', including learning how to play difficult classical music pieces on the piano as well as mastering multiple languages in a matter of a few days. Instead of turning into a mensch, Eddie decides to model himself after Gordon Gekko. He starts as a day trader and begins amassing some money and this is where perhaps the first plot hole appears in the film. If he's such a genius, why does he have to borrow $100,000 from a Russian loan shark? During a voice-over, Eddie claims he needs the money fast but given his talents, couldn't the newly transformed Eddie have made that kind of money in a week or two? His financial success leads Lindy to change her mind about him and she's back in his arms in no time. Eddie also insinuates himself into the business world of business tycoon Carl Van Loon (another average performance by Robert De Niro) and is on the verge of earning millions, advising Van Loon as he's about to complete a merger with Atwood, a business rival. Eddie's transformation now appears complete.Screenwriter Leslie Dixon manages to keep things moving even after Eddie's transformation is finished. Since there is a limited supply of NZT, all the really bad guys are after Eddie including the loan shark and a stalker. What's more there are very bad side effects to this medication. Eddie is shocked to see his ex-wife, who is going downhill from NZT's side effects as well as discovering previous users have either died or are physically debilitated. Eddie also can't recall where he is for 18 hours and later he's implicated in a murder of a woman in a hotel.There's also an exciting scene where the stalker goes after Lindy. She's seemingly cornered in Central Park (of all places) by the Stalker, but Eddie advises her to take one pill of NZT, which allows her to figure out how to stop her pursuer. Her escape is exciting but contains one ugly misstep: she grabs a little girl who's skating on an ice rink, and uses her as a human machete—slashing her pursuer with the blade of the little girl's skate (I wonder why no one chased her and why she wasn't initially charged with child endangerment).The second act crisis is rather perfunctory, with Eddie going toe to toe with the Russian loan shark and his henchmen. There a few twists and turns in this confrontation, especially when Eddie runs out of his NZT, stabs the loan shark and is forced to drink his blood in order to get NZT back into his system.While a good part of this is somewhat unbelievable, it all adds up to some breezy entertainment. Unfortunately, Leslie Dixon, the film's screenwriter opts for a typical Hollywood ending, which dilutes the film's overall impact. We're asked to accept that Eddie somehow overcomes the addiction to NZT and retains his mental abilities--even though everybody else becomes addicted and goes downhill after being unable resist, after taking one pill. I also wondered why Lindy did not succumb to the effects of NZT and become an addict (I guess since she's one of the 'good ones', she has the willpower to resist).Finally, why should we really root for Eddie? Has he done anything good to help humanity? In the end he's a politician who rejects Van Loon, who wants to control him, even after he becomes president. But Eddie still is sleazy—after all he is a politician (not a brain surgeon!). A better ending would have Eddie sacrificing himself to save Lindy—penitence for his decision to use drugs and suck up to bad guy Van Loon.I enjoyed 'Limitless' up to a point. It's a fast-paced thriller, undone mainly by a cheap ending, that makes little sense.",Limitless

Luckily to me, Limitless is, in fact, a crime thriller where the specific drug is mainly triggering ""down-to-earth"" events and relationship changes. However, it is no drug movie either - the main emphasis is on other issues than drug trafficking or miserable life of addicts.Director Neil Burger has splendidly exploited the values of the book (The Dark Fields by Alan Glynn) as well as contemporary technical opportunities, but the real star/gem is Bradley Cooper whose character changes are performed in a great and trustworthy manner. The always talented Robert De Niro plus two pleasant actresses Abbie Cornish and Anna Friel provide additional value to the movie.

57,freemantle_uk,The price of perfection,5,30 March 2011,"Based on the novel The Dark Fields by Alan Glynn, Limitless has been gaining glowing reviews from different publications, like Empire, Time Out and Spill.com. But to me it is a film that a win for style over substance.Eddie Morra (Bradley Cooper) is a struggling writer suffering from writer's block and girlfriend (Abbie Cornish) broke up with him. His ex-brother-in-law Vernon Gant (Johnny Whitworth) sees him on the streets of Manhattan and offers him special drug, NZT. NZT increases a person's intelligence and makes them use 100% of their brain. Eddie starts taking it, finishing his book in four days and starts playing the stock market, making a massive fortune. He gets to work for a powerful businessman, Carl Von Loon (Robert De Niro) but slowly Eddie becomes more addicted the drug, suffering side-effects like confusion and memory loss and gets in deep with Russian gangsters and running into trouble with business rivals and the police.Neil Burger certainly made a great effort to make what could have been an internal story into a visual experience. One element of his direction that worked was showing before any takes NZT the world is shot with a drab grey filter and afterwards the world is bright, a symbol of the potential a person can fulfil. There are visual tricks like letters raining from the ceiling or seeing numbers ceiling like on a old airport message broad. But some moments are very trippy whether it was a small thing like seeing many hands or showing the passage of time and location using a mirror scene like the White Spites music video for Seven Nation Army. Some of the scenes showing the negative effects of the drugs and the withdrawal symptoms felt like Burger was trying to make a mainstream Requiem for a Dream. Overall there is not much in the actual plot and the film was disengaging. Some events felt like their were skipped over which I sure were possibly were looked at more detail in the novel. Spill.com claimed that Limitless was a lot like Fight Club: but I think it's a long way from matching that film.Cooper's character joked to his two bodyguards never wear the same suit: this is not The Matrix, I certainly agree with that statement. There is also a scene when Cornish is clashed over a ice rink and basically I thought how could anyone do that on shoes without falling over: there is also another plothole that scene took play in around April, when most outdoor ice rinks in New York are only open in the winter.The acting is fine throughout the film: it is good to see that at least Robert De Niro is trying to fine a decent film (compared to Little Fockers). Bradley Cooper was perfectly fine as the lead and he will get more leading roles. But his character was nihilistic, a character who used his new gifts for himself to make money and sleep with woman. It could be argued that would be how a person would really act if they had developed this level of intelligence but it made it hard to make an audience sympathise. Andrew Howard who played the Russian Gangster Gennady looked to me very much like cross between Jason Statham and the computer game character Niko Belic. Sadly many of the female characters just disappeared off the screen.",Limitless
58,meeza,Not limitless with mediocrity!,7,29 December 2012,"I give you fair warning before you continue reading; I just took a verbal pill called UPP (Unlimited Pun Power) which can enhance pun memory to 100 percent, instead of the mere 20 percent we punners use. So there will be no pun limit in this review! Before you stray away, I must state that I am joking. I included that ""pillacious"" entry because that is the main premise of the flick ""Limitless"". It stars Bradley Cooper as Eddie Morra, a down-on-his-luck struggling writer who runs into his ex- brother law who introduces Eddie to a limitless memory pill that is able to use 100 percent of brain power. Morra, Morra, Morra how do you like it? How do you like it? Even though that sounded more like an Andrea True Connection, the real connection that Eddie has with the drug is precisely to want more of it. The top-secret pill, called NZT, is Eddie's meal ticket to break into the brokerage business and rise to the top; which is what precisely happens. I will not divulge any more info on where the NZT leads Eddie to, but I will say that situations get incredibly zany when a Russian mobster also gets his hands on the pill among other messy situations; so zany in fact that the movie starts losing its semi-validity because of it. And that is where Director Neil Burger got a bit fried in cooking up ""Limitless""; however, Burger was king in a few scenes in helming the movie, especially the scenes in displaying the power of NZT in Eddie. As far as the ""Limitless"" scribe goes, unfortunately I do have to prescribe a dose of authenticity to Leslie Dixon's cluttered screenplay. Bradley Cooper shows he can carry a movie as best as he can with his strong leading performance as Eddie Morra; and it was fortunate that Bradley did not overdose with ""over- the-top"" thespian antics in his work in ""Limitless"". Robert DeNiro's supporting work as a CEO executive who recruits Morra for a merger was a bit bland and needed a few uppers. But who am I to criticize the great Robert DeNiro! And Abbie Cornish was very much underutilized as Morra's on-and-off girlfriend Lindy. So yea, my critical bag is mixed when it comes to my ""Limitless"" reactions. But if you can stand the few highs and several lows of this movie, then I think you might be ready to pop in ""Limitless"" to your system. *** Average",Limitless
59,st-shot,Limitless reaches its halfway through.,5,22 March 2011,"Turn on, tune in, conquer the world seems to be the mantra in this Leary fairy tale about a guy with writer's block that gets his hands on the ultimate hallucinogenic that will open every door that Huxley puts in front of you. The film itself mimics a drug experiences with an early rush of intense energy and giddiness followed by fatigue and the drag of coming down and it turns out to be more pink elephant than white rabbit.Eddie Morra is on the skids. He can't get past the first page of his book and his girlfriend and meal ticket has just walked out on him. He runs into a shady of character former brother in law on the street who turns him on to a super brain steroid. The initial results are more than promising as he writes 40 pages of his book and screws his landlady. Clearly he has to have more of this stuff. He locates the ex- brother in law but more importantly inherits his stash. Eddie is soon wheeling and dealing ten to twenty steps ahead of his competitors and a hot property to land in the world of big business. He is dogged however by some pretty tough cookies who want in on the miracle drug.Narrated in the first person of the protagonist Eddie (Bradley Cooper) at first is a benign though self destructive Lubowski type who morphs into a smug Wall St. wizard creep before circumstance overtakes him and blood begins to flow and the film's minimal credulity flies out the window. Cooper does a fine job of carrying the film convincingly moving from Jekyl to Hyde as he trips his brain fantastic but director Burger is intent on making him an unrepentant super hero and the sublime early visuals soon become absurd posturing on a parallel planet, Eddie's World, which like this film is as barren as the moon.",Limitless

61,estebangonzalez10,Limitless: A Parable of Our Society,7,25 June 2011,"¨You know how they say we can only access 20% of our brain? This lets you access all of it.¨ When Limitless begins you might confuse this film with another Hangover sequel, but unlike in those movies Bradley Cooper takes a pill to enhance his life not forget about what happened last night. This pill has the opposite effect on his life, instead of getting hungover, he gets smarter. This action thriller has a very interesting premise: a drug has been discovered that allows you to use your brain to a hundred percent of its capacity. Not many people know about the existence of this pill, but Cooper's character has been fortunate enough to get his hands on it and therefore takes advantage of the situation. The advantages don't come without risks however and that is how the plot develops and traps us. The film is narrated in first person in order to let us know everything that is going on. The movie isn't flawless either, the first minutes of the film are very self explanatory and leave no room for us to wonder and figure out what is happening. The beginning serves as a fifteen minute introduction to the story and we can't help but notice this is taken from a novel. Leslie Dixon (Mrs. Doubtfire) actually adapted the film from Alan Glynn's novel ¨The Dark Fields.¨ The beginning seems taken straight out from the novel and it doesn't really work in the film, but once we get past the introduction the action and thrills begin. I'm not a huge fan of having a narrator letting us know everything that is going on with the story, and in this film the opening sequence suffers from this. Neil Burger (The Illusionist and The Lucky Ones) however brings the movie back to the right direction and lets the rest of the plot play out nicely.Bradley Cooper is Eddie Morra, a writer who has just worked out a deal with a publisher but can't come out with the inspiration to write his novel. He has long hair, a hippy style, his apartment is a mess, and his life seems to be going nowhere. Eddie Morra is the sort of person no one expects anything from. Even his girlfriend, Lindy (Abbie Cornish), gives him the keys to his apartment back and decides to end their relationship. Eddie is a mess, but his life is about to change when he accidentally runs into his ex brother in law, Vernon (Johnny Whitworth), who happens to have a pill that will change his life. Eddie is reluctant at first, but he doesn't have anything to lose so he decides to try it. The effects of the NZT pill are almost immediate; Eddie begins to remember things that have been locked up in his unconsciousness. He can remember anything he's ever read, heard about, or seen. Suddenly he gets inspired to write, fix his room, and tighten up, his whole life changes in one day thanks to the pill. The next morning he is back to his old self but he decides to contact Vernon in order to buy more NZT's. Once he gets to his apartment he finds Vernon dead and the entire room is a mess. He discovers where the pills are and takes them. Now with the pills, Eddie's life takes a drastic change. He becomes successful and begins making a lot of money in the financial industry. An important businessman, Carl Van Loon (Robert de Niro), takes an interest in him and wants his services. However, Eddie discovers there are some side effects to NZT, and some very dangerous people are also after the pill.Limitless has plenty of action and thrills to keep you hooked. Bradley Cooper is also great as the lead role. Andrew Howard and Tomas Arana play the villains who are mysteriously after the NZT pills. The movie has a sort of strange feel to it at times; for moments it seems as if we the viewer have taken the pills as we experience everything in shaky bright and fuzzy colors. There is plenty of suspense and at times it's hard to know where the movie is going, but it really works well and ties nicely at the end. Limitless does present a moral dilemma as we see how the pill enhances Eddie's life, but at the same time it barely kills him due to the strong side effects. As a society we have grown to rely on different kinds of pills that enhance our mind and bodies without even considering the side effects and dependence these pharmaceutical drugs are having on us. I think that Neil Burger presents these issues very well in this story that serves as a parable for what our society is turning into in its strive for perfection. I really enjoyed this thriller although it has a couple of flaws here and there, but it still is worth watching thanks to Bradley Cooper's leading performance.http://estebueno10.blogspot.com/",Limitless

63,sauravjoshi85,Entertaining movie with unique concept,8,28 June 2020,"Limitless is a Sci-Fi thriller movie directed by Neil Burger and stars Bradley Cooper, Robert De Niro, Abbie Cornish and Andrew Howard.There is no doubt Limitless is a unique concept and pretty decently executed although the execution could've little better but still it's not disappointing.The movie revolves around a failed writer who was not able to write a single line of his proposed novel suddenly writes a best selling novel and all thanks to some pill who transforms his life upside down and he starts getting rich by many means.Bradley Cooper had played his part convincingly well and we can see the effort put in by him. Robert De Niro is an actor who should never be judged and when it's comes to acting he is a gem. Other supporting characters were also decent.Screenplay of the movie is little problematic and neither disappoints nor fully satisfies as it's has it's own negative and positive traits but majorly holds the movie perfectly. Music of the movie is good and catchy, Climax of the movie is good with a perfect ending.Overall an entertaining movie and with great performances by Cooper and De Niro.",Limitless
64,juneebuggy,"An original and intriguing story idea, a good movie",8,29 July 2015,"I liked this a lot. An original story idea following a yummy Bradley Cooper as Eddie; an aspiring author who overcomes his writers block with the aid of a new drug that unlocks the full potential of his brain. NZT allows him to recall everything he has ever read, seen or heard, learn a language in a day, and comprehend complex equations. He also forges into a partnership with a powerful businessman (Robert DeNiro) while suffering side effects and trying to evade the bad guys, intent on getting his stash.Considering the top billing DeNiro was kind of a non-issue here, he has a very small role. I liked the scene in the park where 'Lindy' -the girlfriend escapes the bad guys via NZT, running skills and the sharp blade of a skate.I did have a few problems with some of the ending scenes being kinda silly, such as the easily accessible ""safe house"" with the breakable windows allowing the bad guys to get in. Still, a good movie. I would love a few of these pills. I would love to be able to access more of my brain, have more energy, learn a language, figure stuff out. 7/12/15",Limitless
65,kluseba,Waste of philosophic and scientific potential in this stylish action-thriller,7,24 October 2016,"''Limitless'' is an entertaining science-fiction movie based upon the theory that humans are only using ten percent of their brain and the question what might happen if we were able to access more or all parts of our brain efficiently. Instead of focusing on the scientific and philosophic thoughts behind this concept, ''Limitless'' wastes a lot of potential as it limits itself to being an entertaining action- thriller with a debatable ending and moral.The story focuses on the life of Eddie Morra. In the beginning, he seems to be a naive loser who never gets anything done and gets dumped by his girlfriend. When he starts taking a drug offered to him by a shady acquaintance, his life seems to change for the better as Eddie Morra becomes a popular writer, makes a lot of money on the stock market and becomes friends with a group of careless jet- setters. Soon, his addiction to the drug starts having negative impacts on himself and people around him as he gets tracked down by other addicts, competitors and loan sharks. In addition to this, he starts having blackouts and severe pain at times. He even gets involved in a murder case where he can't remember whether he killed the victim or not because of the drug. As he tries to find out more about the nootropic NZT-48, he realizes that a lot of addicts got sick or died of it either because of overdosing it or because they tried to stop taking it.At this point, the movie could have taken a more thoughtful approach to elaborate on the horrors of drug addiction and its side effects. Instead, we get to see a lot of chasing passages, conspirative manipulations and murder scenes leading to a morally debatable ending that is explained very weakly. Overall, you get an entertaining, fast-paced and well done action-thriller but the story wastes its scientific potential midway through the movie and lacks inspiration in the second half.From that point of view, I like the very similar ''Lucy'' by Luc Besson much better because it keeps asking philosophic and scientific questions and has a thought-provoking ending. People probably preferred ''Limitless'' because it glorifies the sex, drugs and rock and roll lifestyle and because it's easier to understand. In the end, I can recommend ''Limitless'' if you are looking for an entertaining action-thriller with solid actresses and actors and a stylish production. If you are looking for something which is both entertaining and intellectual, I would rather recommend Luc Besson's ''Lucy''.",Limitless

One day, his drug-dealing ex-brother-in-law lets him in on a clear little tablet he called NZT. When Eddie takes this tablet, his mind miraculously starts to work at a level he had never known before. Finishing his book in no time is just the tip of the iceberg. As his mind's capacity is limitless, so was his personal and financial success. But of course, there is no such thing as a perfect drug. As his body experiences the physical side effects, his life seemed like it was also careening into a violent crash. Can Eddie stop the vortex into his own self-destruction? Or can there be something good that comes out of all this?Bradley Cooper, with all his alpha-male screen presence, was not really convincing as Unsuccessful Eddie. But when he transforms into Successful Eddie, he really goes to town with his confident portrayal. This movie was practically a one-man show for Cooper. Abbie Cornish (as Eddie's girlfriend Lindy) and Robert De Niro (as Eddie's boss Van Loon) were not really that material to the plot. The movie had a fascinating premise as NZT was supposed to open up all the corners of our mind. The director had a very imaginative way of executing this idea for the big screen. The special effects done for this were very good. However, because the drug was supposed to make your mind work one hundred percent, sometimes you will wonder why Eddie still gets himself into all these stupid problematic situations. You would think he would have foreseen all possible scenarios before he decides to do something.Ironically then, you need to tell your own mind not to over-think when watching this movie. It is practically a morality tale about drug addiction and its evils. I did not really like the way it ended.

Bradley Cooper provides a good performance as always, with Robert De Niro and others providing mostly solid ones as well. The film starts a bit formulaic like, but it overcomes its tropes to become something truly original as it evolves into the complex sci-fi thriller you see until the very end. The cinematography is nothing too impressive for the most part, but it does have glimpses at some unique shots throughout. The script seems average for an adaptation point of view, but seems to coalign quite nicely in its now given form.

70,Jonny_Numb,Well Within Limits,4,6 April 2011,"It's frustrating when any work of art -- be it an album of music, a novel, a painting, or a film -- carries a distinct yet maddeningly unplaceable sense of familiarity; when its sources and inspirations bubble exceedingly close to the surface without ever really showing their faces, as if embarrassed by what has been done with their influence. ""Limitless"" is a film fraught with such familiarity, and as a result, comes nowhere near matching its title. The plot involves disheveled, would-be writer Eddie Mora (the reliably charismatic Bradley Cooper), who has a run-in with a long-unseen cohort, who hooks him up with a transparent, dime-sized drug called NZT. After his first tab, Eddie plows through his novel and becomes a sudden fountain of once-untapped knowledge (the aim of the drug is to free up all the unused, inaccessible space in the human brain); he makes connections up the societal ladder, and eventually uses his expanded headspace to...wait for it...play the Stock Market and make himself filthy rich. This leads him to a position of grace with a powerful corporate mogul played by Robert De Niro (on default mode, as is usually the case these days). As one might predict, what goes up must come down, and the demands of NZT eventually cause Eddie to run afoul of some time-filling Russian mobsters who serve no real purpose other than to shoehorn some overly contrived, plot-desperate conflict into the proceedings. As directed by Neil Burger, ""Limitless"" is pulp, plain and simple -- alternating between bizarrely jokey voice-over narration, some very cool (if narratively disposable) 'rollercoaster' shots, and dour sermons on the side effects of addiction, all while culminating in an ending that favors convenience over believable logic.",Limitless

There are lots of drug addiction connotations you can make with the story yet this never really feels like a story about drugs even though it should.

That's what this movie is: it's fun. There are plenty of moments where it almost takes things too far and almost becomes obnoxious (there's nothing worse than a movie that thinks its smarter than it is), but for the most part this film is carried along by some innovative cinematic techniques, a solid performance by Bradley Cooper, and an overall bonkers concept. This film wont be remembered as an uber-classy thriller; if anything it'll be remembered as the pretty decent movie Cooper made before he started to really make some great career choices (""Silver Linings Playbook"", ""American Sniper"", ""A Star is Born"") and simultaneously it will be remembered as the film Robert De Niro (""Taxi Driver"") made after he started to run out of money from all of the great movies he made earlier in his career.",Limitless

75,Spondonman,Remember what the Dormouse said > Feed your head,7,27 July 2014,"This was inexplicably recommended to me by one of my movie-expert friends, an expert who I think doesn't watch any films older than brand new. If there's a next time I'll make sure I'll tell him my opinion on this one and that The Wizard Of Oz is one of my favourite smart films, he may have heard of that one.Bradley Cooper plays a loser who gets to pop a mind-expanding pill that changes his life; as in one pill makes you larger, one pill makes you small blah. It's all slickly and sickly handled, Cooper begins his rise to wealth and power on the back of a limited amount of the drug, whilst brutal gangsters and other assorted thuggish users are out to nobble him for his stash. It's an engrossing plot for the most part with only a couple of gross-out bits – didn't see the slurpy bit coming with the Russian gangster, but didn't want to either. Cooper puts in his usual sterling performance as the main man and he's in almost every scene. As with all fantasies you're forced to take a number of plot turns for granted and follow the relative outcome algorithms along to the end, either to the end of the film or more likely to the end of the supply of drugs. At least the spice on Frank Herbert's science-fictional Dune set ten thousand years in the future was inexhaustible! But as with all things, the ending comes and with it the only twist possible: however if you're not prescient reference the result of Paul Muad'dib's junkie experience on Dune.

76,SnakesOnAnAfricanPlain,Limitless (2011),7,8 March 2012,"Limitless is the kind of film that asks you, what would you do in this far fetched but entertaining situation? Bradley Cooper plays Eddie Morra, a struggling writer that has been procrastinating for months. He stumbles across his ex-brother-in-law and is eventually offered a new kind of drug. This drug allows you to access every last part of your brain, allowing you to recall things you saw years ago, and just having the drive to succeed. You only have to hear things once for you to remember it. Of course it isn't all fun and games. Morra soon finds he is skipping large parts of his day, with no idea of what happened, and when he tries to lay off the drugs he becomes immensely sick. This is a story about trying to find an easy fix to life's problems. Morra could easily finish his book if he just encouraged himself to do so. His antics spin wildly out of control, and as others latch on to his secret he becomes wrapped up in a world of money, deception, sex and even murder. Limitless really wants you to think about its premise which it does so effectively. I also enjoyed the fact it didn't try and weigh itself down with scientific ""facts"". It just gives you the idea and you can except it or not. There did seem to be a push at the end to really make this more action packed than it needed to be, but this is the kind of clever science fiction that I like. Part Twilight Zone, and part real life.",Limitless
77,rgkarim,Limitless: Is a little more limited then expected,7,19 March 2011,"Review for Limitless Okay this movie can be summed in one major theme: drug addiction! This movie is a film that glorifies drugs and the rewards that they seem to offer. The film starts off with a quick shot of the current predicament our protagonist is in, played by Bradley Cooper. After that we get into a quick introduction into the messed up life of our character which is shot in a grayish and dismal tone. The setting and camera work are appropriate for the introduction, but in a dark theater setting can make you more tired than interested in the movie. However, we are quickly and randomly introduced to his ex-brother in law who quickly gets him hooked on the miracle pill. This introduction is very random and not strong suited, but again it's about being addicted to drugs not how he gets into it. Things pick up from there and the effects of the drug are seen in a quick flash of color and light. A majority of the scenes show him studying his business work or partying with various drunks and clients, which reminds me of an expensive take of Jersey Shore. Eventually Robert De Niro's character comes in and plays the role of the arrogant, harsh, over the top business man who becomes the man focus of Cooper's character. Once we see this guy, things begin to pick up and we start diving into the harsh reality of a drug addict, which is extraordinarily portrayed by the characters in this movie. The movie then becomes a portrayal of fighting the greed and drive for success and the desire for breaking the addiction which can be exciting and boring depending on the scenes. Throughout the movie we also see a random guy who is a combination slasher/stalker throughout the movie, that really isn't explained well in the movie. The first strength of this movie is the makeup and acting that combine to make characters who look and seem to be dependent on drugs. This combination draws you into the story and setting and keeps you interested in the character and helps relate to the struggle. Combine this with the strong musical score and the fantastic camera shots and you have made a fantastic scene that captures the suffering the characters have. Some of the scenes that show the enlightenment of the drug are creative as well, but mainly weird and a little confusing at some points when we see multiple versions of the character on the pill. The suspense of the chase scenes makes the film exciting at some points and the 'action' scene at the end gets your heart racing and your pulse up. There were also some fun one liners that kept the movie fun, and helped relieve the depression that hit at some points in the movie.The biggest weakness is the glorifying of drugs and that they can be beneficial to your overall success in the world. This motif is not true, at least not on this level, and this approach could make people want to do drugs. Unfortunately many people who see this movie may be easily swayed into taking drugs that promise benefits, which could lead to some problems. Just like Glee makes fun of serious issues, this movie makes fun of drug abuse and seems to reward such careless use of the drugs, which I disagree with. Another thing that was not appealing was some of the camera work used in this movie. Although most of it was good, there were some computer camera effects that could make people dizzy or give headaches if you are affected by this. The zooming in of the various walkways and streets is a creative representation of getting to the destination, but may be more of a motion sickness curse than a blessing. Continuing on, it was surprising to see that De Niro's character had such a minor role in this movie, really being nothing more than a greedy business man in search of power. It's not his best role in my opinion, but he does play is solidly capturing that greedy eye with a strength he had harnessed. Next are some of the cheesy solutions and actions the characters made when on the drug, as it made them seem superhuman. I guess if you had access to a 100% of the brain you would have great processing power, but that doesn't mean they can run faster or punch with super karate moves. That to me was a little cheesy. Another flaw is the grotesque and ridiculous scene near the end of the movie where a big fight breaks out and the character has to drink blood to get his dose of the drug. Some may like this sort of scenario made famous by SAW, but that's not my cup of tea. Some of the characters introduced, such as the stalker, were either pointless or extremely compelling, but the movie did not really tie them to the story very well. Finally the ending is a little bit cheesy and fake, which mocks the tone the movie was setting up and again further glorifies that drug abuse and addiction lead to better outcomes in life. Overall the movie is just fine it is suspenseful and intense at many times, yet really slow and dragged out at other times. Some of the scenes are very graphic and intense; sometimes leading me to believe it should be Rated R not PG-13. Still the acting is superb and most of the camera work brings the movie to life for the most part. Overall I would give this movie a 7 for a solid capture of drug addiction, yet not fulfilling the promise that it made in the trailers at the beginning of the movie.",Limitless

Bradley Cooper gives a very good performance as the underdog who turns into a force to be reckoned with by using this drug. His potential is limitless but there are side effects and external risks. He has memory loss and feels sick to his stomach and like an addict he needs more of the drug to keep going. He also has newfound enemies keen to get their hands on this rare product. This limitless potential that the drug gives him balanced with the real imminent dangers he faces makes this film a very believable and enjoyable thriller.

81,brando647,High Potential Film but Ultimately Feels Directionless,7,3 September 2011,"I was tempted to give this film a higher rating because I do think it's better than your average flick. It's a decent thriller but I think my problem is that I can't decide which of the handful of subplots is supposed to be our primary focus. The cast does a great job, but the story seems like it's being pulled in too many directions and, by the end, I'd didn't feel like I'd gotten a satisfying enough conclusion to any of them. Bradley Cooper (THE HANGOVER films, THE A-TEAM) is given a chance to headline his own film based on a novel from Irish author Alan Glynn. Cooper is an aspiring sci-fi writer who's hit rock bottom. He can't pay his rent and his girlfriend's leaving him. He's got a book contract, but he hasn't even brought himself to write a single word. Everything's looking down until his ex-brother-in-law shows up and introduces him to miracle designer drug NZT-48. Users begin to use their brain to the full potential and it's not long before Eddie Morra (Cooper) is using his new mental mastery to play the stock market and act as a consultant for a major business merger, but not without making a few enemies.LIMITLESS feels like a bunch of miniature related stories, all focused on the character of Eddie Morra, and all rolled into one film. There's Eddie's dependence on NZT-48. If he quits it outright, he'll die like others before him. There is Eddie's involvement in the Van Loon/Atwood merger. Then there's Eddie's failing relationship with his girlfriend Lindy and his involvement with Russian mobster Gennady, who has developed a taste of his own for NZT-48 and won't let Eddie cut him off. There's enough going on here that it probably could've been developed further into a possible television series. Instead he just bounces around between subplots until the end where everything is tied up loosely. The first time I watched it, I wasn't sure which story was to be the primary and assumed it was his involvement with business mogul Carl Van Loon (Robert De Niro). The movie's trailers certainly seemed to paint it that way for me. Instead, the merger is just something going on in the background while Eddie deals with the ever-growing threat of Gennady (Andrew Howard) until the eventual confrontation. I would've preferred if the movie focused on Eddie's meteoric rise in the business world and how he struggles to maintain his new life while fighting to overcome the possibly fatal effects on NZT-48.I'm always a sucker for a good science fiction film, and LIMITLESS sort of falls into that category with the development of this wonder drug that unlocks your brain's potential. I'm pretty sure the belief that we only use 10% of our brains has been proved wrong already, but I was willing to ignore that since the movie's premise is so appealing. Who wouldn't want a pill that can jack your brain into overdrive, turning you into the ultimate success? I thought Cooper did a great job here, going from disorganized failure to man of the year. I wished De Niro would've had a larger role in the film, perhaps catching on to Cooper's secret early and trying to play it against him. Unfortunately, we get only a tiny bit of that in the final act of the film and it never really gets a chance to get off the ground. I've never read Glynn's ""The Dark Fields"" on which this movie was based, but the movie's made me curious enough to pick it up in the future. There was a lot of potential in this movie and, while it was a fun movie, I just thought it didn't accomplish as much as it could've.",Limitless

This was quite entertaining. Not exactly like a comedy as one would imagine with the plot line being what it is. No, this is high drama, but does have some funny moments.I kept asking myself who is Bradley Cooper and someone said he was in THE HANGOVER. Ah, yes, that almost comedic comedy. I saw that and didn't see anything funny in there except for the Taser scenes. But, Cooper proves my point in that so-called comedians do better with drama because they have the timing for drama, not comedy. Cooper did exceptionally well in this movie. (Bob, you do know they are making THE HANGOVER 2, don't you?) I have low expectations about that, but will give it a shot. Also, Robert DeNiro (as Carl Van Loon) was excellent. I just hope his not-so-funny comedy days are over with. For me they weren't working for him. But in drama, he has few peers. And, if truth be told, he is extremely funny in dramas when he is has some funny lines to deliver in that serious way he has that produces laughter. He was great in here and I wouldn't rule out a Best Supporting Actor award. But, that's just me. Abbey Cornish (as Morra's girlfriend). Wow! Where did she come from? Absolutely beautiful and sexy. Will have to keep an eye out for her in the future. She could be the next Charlize Theron. Hmmmm..The story isn't as predictable as one might think. It has a few twists and turns and not all of them pretty. The way they did the flashbacks in the beginning was exceptional. Very good. The acting by all, the pacing, real stunts and the CGI were all right on the mark. Very entertaining. Well, that's my 10%. Violence: Yes. Sex: No. Nudity: No. Language: No.",Limitless
83,moviexclusive,"A movie that dares you to imagine by imagining it for you in limitless visual panache and dynamism- in other words, it's one heck of an electrifying thriller",8,5 April 2011,"Fact- we can only access 20 per cent of our brain. Is there a solution to this, you ask?Well, yes actually, there is a pill called NZT-48 that will allow you to access all of it. Question- would you take it? OK, maybe it's a bit of a stretch to ask you to imagine the implausible without first demonstrating the ""Limitless"" possibilities it unravels, so here's an example of what it can do. Before the pill, Eddie Morra (Bradley Cooper) is a blocked writer still finding the first words of his long-overdue novel. He is unshaven, lives in a shabby rented apartment in Chinatown, and has just been dumped by his girlfriend Lindy (Abbie Cornish). Post-pill, Eddie finishes his book within four days, picks up several new languages- each one within three to four hours- and builds up a two million-dollar investment portfolio on Wall Street within two weeks. Wish-fulfilment for most perhaps, but you could very well live the dream. And you know what the best part about it is? It was all you in the end. Yes, you were the one who accomplished it all, not through cheating, but on tapping on the full spectrum of your own innate cognitive abilities. Now tell me you don't want a high like that? Am I overstating it? Nope, not at all. The caveat? Well, yes there's that. It's illegal you see, non-FDA approved, and may have side effects if you change the dosage you've been taking it at too quickly. There are also dependency issues, so once you start, you can't just quit it. Other than that, you just have to deal with the saturated colours around you, the tightened focus with which you view things, and the occasional time warps where you lose time and can't quite remember what just happened right before. If you need a visual demonstration of how this all feels, well look no further than director Neil Burger's enticing 105-min advertisement here. Burger may have taken the drug himself, for he shoots in the same adrenalized manner the pill is supposed to work, using endless forward- zoom effects and 360-degree panoramic spins. Combining a music-video style with some nifty CGI, the result is something that looks and feels so energetic that it matches the hyperactivity the drug is supposed to unleash, and makes for a uniquely trippy and mesmerising experience. Burger is complemented with smart witty lines from his writer Leslie Dixon, adapting the conceptual form from Alan Glynn's ""The Dark Fields"". Many of these lines she places in Eddie's head to be conveyed through his intermittent voice-over narration- crisp, sharp and not without an intelligent sense of humour. And what better way to get your adrenaline pumping and your mind working than to introduce a little danger, and then elevating the stakes? Yup, nothing like a bit of jeopardy to demonstrate the abilities your mind has when it comes to self-preservation, protecting itself and therefore you. A Russian loan shark (Andrew Howard), a couple of murders and a Wall Street tycoon who goes by the name Carl Van Loon (Robert De Niro) oughta do the job- so watch as Eddie works his way out of these spots of trouble, with NZT-48 helping him to think faster and better than his enemies. To make the deal even sweeter, how about throwing in the hunk from ""The Hangover"" to play Eddie? And guess what- if you don't already know, the dude can act, very well if I may add. Utterly convincing as the down- and-out writer at first, absolutely dashing and debonair as the NZT-ed version of Eddie- Cooper makes Eddie likable every step of the way, even if his character doesn't always deserve it. For some female beauty, how about the Australian actress Abbie Cornish, who bears more than a resemblance to fellow Aussie Nicole Kidman, and looks just as hot as she did in tights and stockings in the recent ""Sucker Punch""? As a bonus, you'll also get Robert De Niro, an acting luminary who twinkles with polished menace in his supporting role here. Now come on, you have got to admit that you're definitely intrigued by this point. Here's the thing, we forgot to add the word ""fiction"" right before the second paragraph from the top. There's no such thing as NZT- 48- it's all make-believe. But don't you wish there was really something out there that could allow you to tap on the ""Limitless"" possibilities inside your own mind? Well at least for now you'll just have to contend with the best approximation of that, and it's all right here within this Neil Burger film that you'll be wishing doesn't end. Indulge and enjoy it while it lasts- yes, you'll savour every minute of it.www.moviexclusive.com",Limitless

86,saadgkhan,"Bold & Refreshing, Bradley Cooper & Neil Burger made it intriguing and exciting.",7,16 June 2011,"LIMITLESS – CATCH IT ( B+ ) Limitless is refreshing, it's one of the few movies which takes you along with it and you feel that you totally understand what Eddie is going through or feeling. Heads off to Neil Burger for using two cameras for before & after effects of drugs. That was a brilliant move which made the movie more relatable and understandable. This is a story about Eddie (Bradley Cooper) finds a drug which can make his mind function 100% rather than 20% as normal human beings. Now the story is how to get benefit out of it and how to save this drug from other peoples as he is not the only one relying on it. I won't go into details how he got it or how he use it because you've to see for yourself how nicely and believably they have translated the medicinal element into the story. My top 3 moments in the movie is when Bradley Cooper have the pill for first time and 2nd when he goes to his X brother in law's house and try to find it (it was heart pumping and I wanted him to find it before police come in) and my 3rd favorite moment was when Abbie Cornish goes her home to pick the pills and gets stock by a stalker and then she has to take a pill to save her life. That was just heart pumping. Loved it. Bradley Cooper certainly stole the show with his charming, powerful performance. I loved him in Alias and was extremely upset when he died. Now watching him again on big roles is really good though I thought he came off as cocky in The Hangover & especially A-Team. He was so good in the movie that even his cranky voice didn't bother me this time. Abbie Cornish is good though I still don't know why Hollywood is fascinated by her? It's just like I can never understand fascination with Sienna Miller. Robert De Niro is good in a supporting role. Overall, it's a must see movie of the season, trust me it's interesting.",Limitless
87,Troy_Campbell,Entertaining popcorn fodder.,6,29 March 2011,"Unfortunately, Limitless is largely just another run of the mill action-thriller. Although fortunately, and ironically, it knows its limits and does reasonably well inside of those confines. He may not stray too far from convention, however Burger adds enough of his own flair behind the camera – most notably the impressive ""speedy tunnel vision"" that shows how Eddie perceives the world whilst drugged up – to keep the energy pumping and give his fourth feature film a spark that smooths out a portion of the hiccups within the screenplay, of which there are a plethora.Adapted from Alan Glynn's novel ""The Dark Fields"" (cheekily used as the title of the book Eddie writes within the movie), veteran scribe Leslie Dixon can't find an even-handed tone and as a result the final act struggles to strike a chord. It's hard to understand what Dixon had intended for the audience to feel at the completion of her amorphous story; the climax is a bizarre non-event that leaves no real resolution. She should be praised for her well-rounded protagonist, though the supporting characters are underwritten with Cornish's girlfriend nondescript at best (makes me wonder what the Aussie actress saw in the role) and De Niro's business tycoon a mere cardboard cut out.I'm not surprised that Bradley Cooper has finally appeared in a bona fide leading role. After decent supporting turns in Yes Man and He's Just Not That Into You he graduated to co-lead star in The Hangover and The A-Team, both of which were highly entertaining and garnered Cooper plenty of attention, and now he's having a stab at A-list glory. If his work in Limitless is a forecast of things to come then the man who started his career on 'Sex and the City' should be around for a while yet, as he effortlessly fills the boots of man who is both an everyday bloke and anything but. He oozes a natural charisma that makes him instantly likable and balances the humour and seriousness deftly.Cooper's appeal and Burger's directorial flourishes keep things afloat and grant Limitless a life as entertaining popcorn fodder.3 out of 5 (1 - Rubbish, 2 - Average, 3 - Good, 4 - Great, 5 - Brilliant)",Limitless
88,dunmore_ego,Full Frontal Lobity,7,13 August 2011,"Bradley Cooper takes a pill that makes him even sexier. Now how is that even possible? LIMITLESS is a breezy fantasy about a shiftless writer, Eddie Morra (Cooper), who is given a mysterious pill that allows him to access 100% of his brain, instead of the usual 20%. A super-man tale (or, in the case of Cooper, a super man-tail) where the protagonist is suddenly faster, smarter, stronger; a regular Steve Austin (without the boing-oing-oing-oing sounds).The pill uninhibits his brain's retention and recall, allowing him to access any information he has ever come in contact with, even peripherally.He discovers its utility in the manliest of ways, as he talks his landlord's wife into bed after screeching at him for the rent: ""Information from the odd museum show, a half-read article, some PBS documentary; it was all bubbling up into my frontal lobes, mixing itself together into a sparkling cocktail of useful information!... She didn't stand a chance."" He wasn't high, wasn't wired. Just clear. He knew what he needed to do and how to do it. On the pills, he thinks of himself as Enhanced Eddie.His social circle suddenly includes stockbrokers and Euro adventurers; his book gets written in four days; his rocket-synapsed mind allows him to explode his income tracking stock trends; income augmented by counting cards at the blackjack table. Women, cars, private jets... He wins back his girlfriend (Abbie Cornish) and gets involved in a global corporate merger... And his eyes turn an even sexier shade of preternatural baby blue.But being dependent on the illegal pills (known as NZT - had to have a 'Z' for action-movie cred), supplied by his drug-dealing, murdered, ex-brother-in-law, means that when the pills run out...Movie smartly intertwines a clutch of mysterious characters that orbit Eddie, all somehow connected with the pills or their results. Robert De Niro as corporate raver Carl Van Loon; Andrew Howard as a fearsome Russian mobster; a constant tail shadowing him (Tomas Arana - not his own Enhanced man-butt); and a detective (Brian Anthony Wilson) that isn't fully convinced Eddie didn't murder his ex-brother-in-law.When Eddie's ex-wife (Anna Friel) contacts him, we learn of the full spectrum of the pill's affects, including the coming crash...When he is mugged, we see Eddie accessing his memories for old Bruce Lee films and even snippets of self-defense videos he saw in passing a store window, bringing it all to bear in a cool, studied trouncing of his assailants. That's why this film works - we want to be this guy. Even for a few moments. We'd all give up some degree of security, sanity and safety for one chance - (as Mel says in BRAVEHEART) Just One Chance - to live the life that our youth and dreams promised us. Let's face it: we'd give up almost anything to be ""the perfect version of ourselves."" Interesting to note that when Eddie wakes after his first pill wears off, he laments his unenhanced state, ""I was back."" Later, only when he gets a pill into him does he say, ""I was back,"" meaning he now considers Enhanced Eddie his true self. Unwitting commentary on those who rely on Zoloft, Valium, Prozac, or any medications (from aspirin to heroin) to consider themselves able to function correctly, as their ""true selves."" LIMITLESS is a very plausible science fiction story (almost Harlan Ellison or Robert Heinlein), written by novelist Alan Glynn, directed by Neil Burger (THE ILLUSIONIST) with some nice disorienting camera tricks, good pacing and solid story twists. It never gets too dark, even when the Russians are trying to kill Eddie by ""cutting your skin at the waist and pulling it over your head. You don't die from the cuts, you die from suffocation."" But it does have a gut-punch vomit moment when a dead Russian's blood is seeping towards Eddie on the floor and he realizes that the last of the NZT is in that Russian's blood, so in a classic junkie move - he starts slurping the seepage!...Can I get a big helping of ""EUUURW!"" with a side order of AIDS please?",Limitless
89,leftbanker-1,What a Blast!,10,10 October 2015,"This film gets 10 stars simply because the idea is so cool, at least to me. The book was OK but I'm glad that I saw the film first to see the improved form of the book. I often wonder how a writer would change a book after publication if given the opportunity. On a personal level I never feel that much of what I write is beyond improvement. It's such a great fantasy and who hasn't thought of being the best person they could possibly be? I think that I actually reach this point, at least sometimes and for a fleeting moment. But what if you could do a lot better? That's what this film explores.This thing is brilliantly paced and the story picks you up and flies you away almost like the viewer is experiencing the same high as the protagonist. Eddie Morro, thanks to this incredible drug, becomes a sort of modern Superman who is cooler, smarted, and hipper than Superman could ever imagine. There are some menacing villains just like in Superman tales, and there is a beautiful woman. Call me simple but that's all the makings of a great movie.The only thing that bothered me in the film as well as the book was that given almost infinite mental powers he chooses to enter the stock market? I just wonder how the same story could play out if he went another direction with his powers. Perhaps the TV series can explore this further. I can't get enough of the story.

91,oneguyrambling,Imagine being as smart as the CSI guys at the last 5 minutes of the ep - only All. The. Time!,8,25 September 2011,"Even the most brilliant and open minded among us can only utilise 20% of our brain's capacity – which explains the continued box-office success of Zack Snyder movies like Sucker Punch. When an author battling crippling writer's block named Eddie (Bradley Cooper) is introduced to an experimental drug called NZT which unlocks the remaining 80-odd he immediately begins operating at a Stephen Hawking like level of intelligence, only with the networking skills of a sports commentator and the sense of omnipotence of a young Kanye West.Cooper is dressed down to highlight just how ordinary he is (and still comes across as a solid 8.5 to my wife). In the early goings it is made clear that while he is a smart man, in the words of dozens of my report cards 'he could do better if he wasn't so easily distracted'.His book deal is in place but is in peril due to his inability to even begin putting his ideas on paper, and this lack of mental traction has caused his ex-girlfriend Lindy (Abbie Cornish) to give up on him. Once NZT falls into his hands and more importantly his bloodstream he straightens up and flies straight instantly. The confusing is child's play to Eddie and he is able to logically work towards solutions at a last 5 minutes of a CSI episode level.Only All the Time! In the days and weeks following Eddie uses his newfound powers as we all would, to gain unfair advantage and to tag unsuspecting women, most notably getting Lindy back thanks to his new get up and go attitude. He is able to master foreign languages and complicated problems in quick time, becoming a go-getting, all answering master of logic. And the guy you want to be around and have on your side.After he works his magic on the stock market and using loan shark money he turns a mere 5 figures into millions in a precious few days Eddie brings the attention of the media, which in turn brings him onto the radar of a Bill Gates via Trump type named Van Loon (Robert De Niro, low key for a change).Unfortunately Eddie's newfound renown and success bring the more nefarious attention of the opportunistic, the greasy loan shark knows something is up and it seems Eddie is being constantly followed. Upon wowing Van Loon with his first meeting he starts upping the dose to remain on top, hires a crack security team to protect him and sets researchers on the trail of replicating what is becoming a diminishing supply of smart pills, pills that seem to have unforeseen negative implications to offset their obvious pluses.Limitless might not be all that great but for a wide release film it sure is ambitious and different, something that can't honestly be said that often lately. Cooper navigates the tenuous tightrope of believability reasonably well and Abbie Cornish is already forging a solid career of her own as a credible supporting actor.After the premise is established and the major characters revealed Limitless loses its way somewhat in the middle section and contains a sequence that could best be described as bafflingly ridiculous. This is partially redeemed by a solid final third with a couple of notable sequences, the more memorable being Eddie's unsavoury thirst for knowledge Final Rating – 7 / 10. In the film Eddie faces the choice between remaining ever-ordinary or being momentarily awesome! The film itself might not reach those spectacular heights but at least it had a crack at glory rather than settling for the usual mediocrity.",Limitless

93,antoniotierno,weird but funny staff,7,21 April 2011,"Hadn't watched other movies starring Bradley Cooper - aside from the last version of A Team - so the lead actor's quite a a new face to me but I reckon he never looked out of place; his acting's not phenomenal but in this instance he has appeared to convey the exhilaration of these special new powers. Coneversely the good looking Abbie Cornish, playing his girlfriend, doesn't get to to put across visible emotions as his fiancé does. Robert De Niro is cast as the great old Wall Street moguls, different form the criminal type he played other times but he certainly gets to prove believable. On the whole LIMITLESS, which never sermonizes on drugs and the morality of drug created intelligence, is a fresh and well-written thriller. It might not pass a logic test but logic sometimes lacks in good movies as well. It's part fantasy and part thriller but conceived in an ingenious way.",Limitless

Hollywood execs have and ""Limitless"" just shows that they wish they could be smart. And it is just a magical pill because any scientific explanation is lacking, at best.We first meet Eddie (Bradley Cooper) on the ledge of a building as bad guys are breaking down his door. He's not going to let them win—apparently, suicide is him ""winning"". But then we rewind back to the beginning of the story. Eddie is an unemployed writer, losing his girlfriend, and losing his grip on reality. When a mysterious pill comes his way, perhaps drugs could secure his grip on reality? One of the many problems, is that Bradley Cooper can never be a worthless slob with no job. With looks like that and eyes that blue, countless romantic comedies have proved that he can easily get women like Julia Roberts, Scarlett Johansson and Jennifer Connelly.Attempting to find clever ways to show off New York (and handsome men vomiting), just sent the camera on a whirlwind spin, and my head on a worse one.

And if they were going to adapt it, the filmmakers should have developed the courage to rework and rethink the material and turn it into the sort of story that it should have been.The excitement before seeing ""Limitless"" only enhanced my disappointment in it. It's such a great idea for a movie! What would it be really like if a human being could access the full potential of their brain's capacity? Scholars have debated for years, but the general consensus is that even the smartest of people can only utilize somewhere between 10-20% of their mental power. So, according to ""Limitless"" and the screenplay written by Leslie Dixon, what would happen if some bum novelist (Bradley Cooper) got a hold of some pills that allowed him to use all of his mind at the same time? Who can say, but what the movie demonstrates is the most subliminal and uninteresting details. When he takes the pill, Mr. Cooper's vision turns into a yellowish glow, he smiles a whole lot more often, speaks a lot of mumbo jumbo, slicks back his hair, has sex with the landlord's wife, writes a novel in a few days, contends with a loanshark who later gets hungry for the pills, and goes to Wall Street.How anticlimactic.At a certain point, things almost start to look up for ""Limitless"" in what later turns out to be one of the lamest plot twists in recent movie history. For a second, we're lead to believe that slicked-up Mr. Cooper might have gotten involved in some kind of a murder scheme.Well, that plot never goes any further than anything else in the movie. In other words, nowhere at all.Limply directed by Mr. Burger, ""Limitless"" is full of nonsensical gibberish, cheap visual gimmicks, and a couple of hamhanded action scenes between Mr. Cooper and the loanshark, who is stereotypically portrayed by Welsh actor Andrew Howard. The cast shows some talent, including Robert De Niro who looks tired and bored throughout the picture, but there is no energy in ""Limitless.""

I do have to commend this movie that it only mentions how little of our brain's potential we use, and doesn't spend time pretending this is based on real science. The pill might as well be magic for all the time they spend explaining it. This is a film that understands what it is, while Lucy was trying too hard to be a more serious film, which just made it seem dumber. I like the idea of someone who uses smarts to get ahead in business and simply make more money. That's the reality of what we all would do with this kind of power, so it makes sense. There was still one of those scenes in this movie of the hero using his brain-power to win a fight, which was kind of stupid, but at least that wasn't his main focus, and he didn't become some super-smart vigilante.I think where Limitless falls short of being a high-quality film, is in the story structure. While I like the setup, and I think Bradley Cooper is a good actor for this role, it felt like the plot didn't go anywhere. Worse than that, it set up a lot of things that it never pays off at the end. It's almost like the filmmakers forgot that they started some of these subplots, so they never remembered to get back to them and explain to the audience what happened. I think the biggest frustration I had (with regards to the lack of follow-through) was the fact that they establish he has a master plan to work on, but then we are never clued in on what that might be. The conclusion suggests what his idea might have entailed, but since we didn't see him preparing for this outcome, it feels like the biggest deus ex machina imaginable. I still enjoyed Limitless as a refreshing take on some common sci-fi tropes, and I can see the potential for a TV series that some executive also saw.

100,KnightsofNi11,Fun and creativity don't come without a few minor kinks,7,23 August 2011,"Amidst the sea of remakes, reboots, sequels, and prequels it's refreshing to see Hollywood produce something wholly original. Limitless is the story of Eddie Morra, a down on his luck writer whose career is going nowhere. Things change when he discovers a drug which enhances the brain immensely, unlocking the other 80% that we don't even have access to. He uses his enhanced intelligence to make money off of the stock market which causes him to get lots of attention from big-shot corporate investors. Morra slowly uncovers a whole line of corruption within the world he has gotten himself involved in, getting himself in over his head and having to deal with a lot more than he bargained for. It's a twisty, complex, and thrilling adventure that could have gone sour quickly, but it is actually surprisingly decent.This is a movie you pretty much go into totally blind. There's no previous work for you to base the film on other than the book, but there's never any knowing if the film will be faithful to the book at all. The film isn't the work of some big time director that one can always expect good things from. It's an original film from the director of The Illusionist and one or two other recognizable titles. So, of course, going in I had my skepticism, seeing how this film could easily just be another dumb thriller that lacks any creativity. But, much to my surprise, it wasn't. It's actually very entertaining and very unique in its substance and style. It tells a story that is excellent at its core, but has a few kinks, making it a tad rough around the edges. A little more effort in tightening up the story could have gone a long way for the film, but its nothing that detracts from the overall impact of the film. Really it is just small absurdities and unrealistic elements that sometimes stretch the film's already thin logic. However, there is enough to hold on to that the film is still plenty entertaining.Limitless finds a good balance between substance and style. It tells its complicated story but maintains a slick atmosphere that makes the film a lot of fun. It's well shot and the cinematography is excellent. Lighting is used heavily, giving the film a wash of bleakness at first, but after Morra takes the brain enhancing pill everything grows brighter. There are a lot of visual quirks that are used to illustrate Morra's enhanced brain. Stylish direction and clever edits give the film a great design and excellent overall style. The entire visual style of the film is just one smart choice after another, giving life and image to something that is going on in our protagonists brain. To do this in writing is easier because a book is a gateway straight into the mind of a character. On film it is more difficult to make it informative as well as interesting, but Limitless pulls it off very well.This film isn't perfect but it is certainly one of the better action suspense thrillers to come out recently. This sub genre is something that produces a lot of pretentious and over zealous trash, but Limitless rises slightly above all that and becomes one of those films worth mentioning. I don't know that I will be talking about Limitless years or even months down the line, but it is a fun watch and a solid film.",Limitless
101,carbuff,"Slick, fun, fast-moving, light-weight Science Fiction",9,19 January 2020,"Almost everyone nowadays knows that the fundamental conceit of ""Limitless"", that we only use a small proportion of our brain, is well-proven scientific nonsense--the brain is the most energy-intensive organ in the body, and we don't carry around any more of it than we need; however, it's also apparent due to advances in technology and biology that we're likely moving in the direction of being able to enhance the average natural cognitive abilities of human beings, possibly even dramatically. Therefore, the premise of this movie is not completely out-and-out pseudoscience. Frankly, I'd be the first to admit that Google has significantly affected the way I actually think. Today, I try to simply remember that particular problems have well-known solutions, rather than to devoting much time to memorizing details I can quickly access.Thus, if you can forgive this movie it's one big scientifically ridiculous ""MacGuffin"", specifically that a mere small pill can temporarily massively ""supercharge"" any human brain, then this fast-paced thriller works extremely well and hardly ever slackens up. Nobody is ever going to mistake ""Limitless"" for ""deep"" science fiction, in which really difficult philosophical problems are tackled, but it's still a healthy step up from being just popcorn entertainment.I personally would like to see the central idea of this film, the consequences of human enhancement"" pushed an awful lot further, but that doesn't detract from the fun of watching this slick, fun, and well-acted production. We'll have to wait for some other movie (far from my original thought) to thoroughly explore the idea of very different classes of ""enhanced"" human beings living together in a single society (or competing societies, for that matter). While we're waiting for that movie, you can watch this one.",Limitless

The cinematography and editing are exciting and stylish, the pacing is just right and Bradley Cooper is all-consuming in the lead-role.The story gets a bit convoluted and messy towards the end and the characterisation of the bad guys is sloppy to say the least.

104,spookyrat1,SciFi v Action,6,15 February 2019,"The concept underpinning Limitless has universal appeal. What if we could make maximum use of those unused portions of the brain we rarely call upon? Unsurprisingly the idea has attracted movie-makers periodically, for decades. In 1996 for instance Jon Turteltaub, made the pretty successful Phenomenon with John Travolta, which, whilst utilising the same basic premise as Limitless, eschewed the thriller aspects almost completely, concentrating on creating a romantic drama. In Luc Besson's Lucy, the sci fi prospects of the intelligence gain are amped up to what I reckon, were ridiculous levels. It becomes unsurprisingly very much an excessive, special effects driven extravaganza.Limitless treads more middle ground. In my opinion it succeeds better in the first half, where Bradley Cooper's Eddie acquires the NZT and we see him on a number of occasions literally metamorphose before our eyes. I like the way director Neil Burger achieves this effect without a deluge of special effects; instead relying on Cooper's acting skills and smarts, upping the tempo and content of spoken dialogue and the use of filters to alter the lighting, along with changes in music and sound effects. Cooper needs special praise here. His performance does much to convince us of the drug's possible benefits to humanity.Somewhere along the production planning though, it was decided by the studio, to turn the movie into an action thriller. As such, it's not a bad one, although it embraces plenty of familiar tropes ( violent Russian hoods, greedy corporations etc.) and relies on some pretty banal plot contrivances to change the movie's tone and direction. Seriously, nothing could convince me, that the new Renaissance Eddie would deliberately seek out a Russian loan shark to obtain more seed money and later forget to pay him back on time. Stuff like this and the arriving police not searching Eddie after he calls in a homicide, make us realise how an up till then smart movie, is suddenly being dumbed down, perhaps in an effort to win over the multi-plex crowds.The conclusion is simply pure Hollywood and I have to say that while I overall liked both movies and found them entertaining, Phenomenon had a much more, sober, realistic finish than Limitless.",Limitless

Lots of chases and runs as our lead on the bottom rung of the ladder ends up with some super drug that makes him super smart and super active.Bradley Cooper is our main man who leads the show and tries to outwit and outrun all the men after him. The pills are more than worth their weight in gold, but scarcity is a valuable commodity. Super intelligence means our main man makes a fortune from the markets, but is he alone with the secret of this drug? Also has he become too smart for his own good that it has put him in danger? It's not just our main man who's sharp. So is the direction and cinematography. Script is good and the fellow actors do a fine job. However, despite lots of plus points it's enjoyable and engrossing but nothing special.

106,agmoldham,Not a great movie for your CV,3,29 September 2011,Limitless is a fairly formulaic Hollywood movie that a churned out by the dozen. It is very difficult to feel any empathy with any of the characters. It tells the story of Eddie Morra (Bradley Cooper) who is introduced to an experimental drug in fairly unlikely circumstances from a former in-law. The drug helps your brain to work much better and transforms Eddie's life. As with most drugs the feeling becomes addictive and their are serious side effects which is what much of the film focuses on. There's a role for Robert De Nero and I'm quite sure this will not be one of the films that he looks back at with any great affection. Overall it's fairly disappointing and also leaves you (or at least me) feeling quite cold at the end of the film.,Limitless
107,ajs-10,Some nice touches in this Sci-Fi/Thriller...,7,15 January 2012,"When I read about the concept behind this film I must say I was quite intrigued; a pill that could allow access to the parts of the brain we don't use? Who could resist? Well it didn't play at my local cinema and so after quite a long wait it finally appeared in the TV listings this week. It had received a bit of a mixed response from the critics but I thought I'd take the plunge anyway. I'll give you my thoughts after this brief summary.Eddie Morra is a struggling writer; he has a contract to write a book but is struggling to find inspiration and motivation. By chance he meets his ex-wife's brother, Vernon, a former drug dealer; he gives him a pill that changes his life. It's called NZT and it enables him to think faster than ever; he finishes his book in double quick time. When the effects wear off he decides he has to get more. He goes to see Vernon who he finds dead. Searching his apartment he discovers his stash and steals it. Now he can take it every day he soon realises that writing isn't for him; stocks and shares are the future. Having had some meteoric success in the stock market, he is now in the spotlight of the big boys. Enter Carl Van Loon, a very successful businessman who takes Eddie under his wing. As a side note, Eddie at this point also gets his girlfriend, Lindy, back. About to broker a major deal; Eddie discovers a disturbing side-effect of the drug I will leave it there or the Spoiler Police (Illegal Drugs Division) will have me banged up for possession.A very well made film with some neat CGI and camera work which is used to try and illustrate the effect of the drug on Eddie. I also liked the narration; it gave an insight into his thought processes as events unfolded around him. Decent performances all round; Bradley Cooper did a good job as Eddie Morra, Robert De Niro was great (as ever), although never really stretched as Carl Van Loon and Abbie Cornish was decent, if underused, as Lindy. Andrew Howard did a good job as the Russian moneylender Gennady and there was a nice little part for Anna Friel as Eddie's ex-wife Melissa.Quite a slick production with some nice touches; not all of them worked, but it's still a perfectly watchable Sci-Fi/Thriller. As I've already said, I did enjoy some of the camera trickery used to illustrate the effect of the drug, in particular the tunnel-like pan straight into the screen, which worked particularly well. There were a few aspects of the plot that didn't quite work for me, but over all it's still pretty enjoyable Recommended.My score: 7.4/10.IMDb Score: 7.3/10 (based on 103,342 votes at the time of going to press).Rotten Tomatoes 'Tomatometer' Score: 69/100 (based on 180 reviews counted at the time of going to press).Rotten Tomatoes 'Audience' Score: 73/100 (based on 84,511 user ratings counted at the time of going to press).",Limitless
108,jrarichards,"Mostly unlikeable, occasionally interesting thriller of very mixed messages",6,15 March 2016,"A guy takes an illicit drug because of its helpful effects, and risks continuing doing so even though EVERYBODY else around him doing the same is becoming disabled and dying. And guess what? He gets away with it, comes off it gently in time, continues to benefit long term and seems set fair to lead a really great life for ever and ever.At my age I can fairly claim to be immune to that kind of message, but can we say with hand on heart that everybody else is? That's how we start and finish in describing Neil Burger's ""Limitless"", but we might also add in the way our hero (played well enough by Bradley Cooper) pays the price for his habit by getting mixed up with some very risky criminals, as well as with big-business type Carl Van Loon (whose name maybe says quite a bit, as this is a driven character for whom profit and takeovers are literally everything). The Van Loon character is played by Robert De Niro, who towers over this film, giving a hugely impressive and enjoyable portrayal (assuming of course that this is not just De Niro being De Niro).This is a strange film for several more reasons. In the first place, it starts off using a storytelling technique that is increasingly abandoned as the story unfolds. This looks like it might endanger the film as a cohesive whole, but somehow does not do so - so a few points for that.The other issue - in fact of key relevance - is that this is another of those ""let's use 100% of our brains and not just 10 or 20% or whatever it is"" films, yet one that has no sci fi pretensions whatever (hence some contrast with, say, ""Lucy""). Ironically, this leaves us much more squarely with the film about the world of business and how drugs might help in that world that I described at the outset - a pretty dark and dubious concept in a piece of work that does have its better moments, even a few that are momentarily thought-provoking. But mostly it's just a kind of adventure thriller that raises questions other than the ones it perhaps intended to.",Limitless
109,Superunknovvn,"No depth, all entertainment",7,1 May 2011,"Of all the Twilight Zone-like movies released this year (the other ones being ""The Adjustment Bureau"" and ""Unknown Identity"") ""Limitless"" is probably the best - which doesn't say a lot. The movie has more than its share of problems.The original premise - a loser type of guy takes a drug that enables him to grow a 4-digit IQ, which makes him successful at first, but gets him into a lot of trouble soon - is kind of intriguing. Neil Burger moves the plot along quickly, Bradley Cooper is well-cast as the guy who turns into a yuppie with a slippery Tom Cruise winner smile. And Robert De Niro plays Robert De Niro.Storywise things don't make complete sense. For all his newly gained intelligence Cooper's character does oversee some important things and makes lots of stupid mistakes. Some plot strings like a dubious murder or whole characters just seem to get forgotten about entirely, like the movie had undergone some re-writes and re-cuts.Maybe even more bothersome is the fact, that ""Limitless"" had the potential of raising some highly philosophical questions, but limits itself (no pun intended) to just a bland story of a guy using his intelligence to make lots of money. The movie's morals are rather questionable that way. It seems like we are supposed to identify with this guy, who's really just power hungry egomaniac.Somehow, you can ignore all that though, because ""Limitless"" moves along so quickly that it never falls apart completely, as it would have in the hands of someone like Michael Bay. Sure, if you want depth or at least some kind of cheap popcorn movie moral, even a lackluster film such as ""The Devil's Advocate"" does a better job. However, if you're only looking for light, but not mind numbing (again, no pun intended) entertainment, ""Limitless"" does its job perfectly well.",Limitless

Visually they did a great job, but the story turns into a no-brainer after the first act.Limitless starts out very well though I must admit while I am fed up with the ""struggling writer"" cliché - a clearly over-represented population in movies. Our Faustian hero could have been anything, from lacklustre student to small-business entrepreneur, it doesn't matter. The main point is about using drugs to enhance your capabilities, to raise above the fray, to ""become successful"", to realise oneself... and what is the trade-off, the after effects? Obviously those points are too philosophical in this story, the side-effects are vaguely used as a plot turn and then the ending simply rushes a solution to forget about it. So to me it is a major failure not to set the story inside a dystopian/noir context. What further cheapens the fine Faustian premise is the ""criminal"" subplot. Hero decides to make a lot of money for his big projects so he just goes to borrow money from some shabby thug. That is really clever. And he just forgets to pay him back, and then his big project is to become a drug-addicted President with the brains to change the world.One thing is sure, the writers didn't have NZT at their disposal.",Limitless
112,Christian_Dimartino,One of my favorite films of the year.,9,17 July 2011,"Bradley Cooper finally gets a leading role in Limitless, one of my favorite films of the year so far. Limitless, from director Neil Burger(The Illusionist) is a thrilling visual wonder that keeps you hooked the whole time. Sadly, I had a large coke and went to the bathroom a lot. Otherwise I would've been hooked the whole time.Eddie(Bradley Cooper) is a loser. He's an aspiring writer who can't go anywhere with his life, and his girlfriend(Abbie Cornish) has just ended it with him. That all changes when a friend of his sells him a pill that makes him more attractive, smarter, and more successful.Robert De Niro plays a businessman who is sort of onto what hes doing, thinking that hes too good to be true.Limitless isn't perfect, but its original and a lot of fun. Cooper has never really gotten to have a movie like this to himself, and now that he does he proves that he is a worthy talent. I enjoyed watching him here. He gets a chance to spread his wings.I like movies with a little brain. I mean, sure, this isn't Inception, but its still a lot of fun and its a sight for sore eyes.

113,joachimokeefe,"Hero, anti-hero, or villain? How to get it completely wrong",4,13 January 2016,"Deadbeat writer takes mind-expanding pill (NZT) that brings instant brilliance except that they haven't sorted out the side effects and loads of bad, bad guys want it bad too. Great premise, great FX, thrilling action, but ultimately a big letdown.PhantomAgony's excellent review of Limitless says much of what I think: there are really, really stupid plot beats for one thing:1/ The police don't bother to search Morra when he calls them to his shot-dead suspected drug-dealer brother-in-law's apartment. He has a large bag of NZT pills stashed in his waistband while in custody for several hours.2/ In spite of now being a financial genius worth $2m, Morra forgets to pay back the vicious thug he borrowed $100,000 from.3/ A man suspected in two ongoing murder investigations carries on an unprecedentedly successful senatorial campaign. Like that would happen.4/ He hires bodyguards who are not on NZT rather than buy and learn to handle a gun himself. That would be too obvious, I guess.5/ The professional hit guy cannot outrun either a small woman or a man with a badly injured leg.The second problem is the faulty character development. Ed Morra (Bradley Cooper, really good) starts off as the plain, inept, ordinary hero who gets a crack at greatness. Over the course of the movie, he cheats on his fiancée twice, possibly murdering one cheatee, tells his fiancée to take a dose of the drug so she can escape a bad guy in spite of having just left his ex-wife who advised him that it's one-way ticket to miserable death, and abandons said ex-wife completely once she has fulfilled her plot purpose. He then becomes a smarmy, unpleasant Wall Street politico who's the biggest SOB in the valley and do you know what? HE DOESN'T PAY ANY PRICE. Getting away with being a total a-hole is completely wrong in terms of the starting character dynamic. In fact, Robert De Niro turns out to be the most noble character, simply by default. Cooper goes from Forrest Gump to Gordon Gecko. It's like Faustus (Walter White, even) getting away with it; dramatically totally unsatisfying.And the nasty undercurrent of this movie is its misogyny. Cooper's ex-wife (Anna Friel) is simply a cipher to indicate the misery of NZT's side effects. Once she's done that, she's dropped completely, in spite of the character being a vital part of his past. Cooper's fiancée has no existence beyond her relation to him, and once he has told her to take the same deadly NZT we don't see her again for over a year; and she's perfectly fine, as though she's been in the character fridge. The scene with her as a woman using NZT (and physically assaulting a young girl) to outwit the bad guy is obvious tokenism. And when he buys this super-duper apartment, why doesn't he move his fiancée in with him - or at least have to explain to her why not? Because in this movie, women don't matter.In the end, Limitless turns into another grating Wall Street politico/financial drama (Bob De Niro as hardass CEO, anyone?) and you end up not liking the hero; not feeling that he has redeemed himself, not rooting for the troubled villain - you just don't like him because he turns out nasty.

121,CinematicInceptions,"Relatively strong story and great plot basis, though with a couple of logic holes.",7,23 May 2015,"While there are some holes you can poke in the logic behind this film, the true spirit behind it is: what if. And, let's face it, that question definitely gets answered, maybe not in a one size fits all way, but nonetheless it turns a guy who's down on his luck into an incredibly successful person. Regardless of what you think of the actual story, you can't deny that it's an interesting plot basis. The whole brain access isn't an entirely new idea, as evidenced by the release of Lucy this past year, though that seems to take a more supernatural approach. You could argue that the story is a little haphazard or implausible, but, as Eddie says, ""I see fifty scenarios"" and unfortunately the movie could only involve one of those fifty.Even though Abbie Cornish and Robert De Niro are advertised as main characters, they get a pretty limited amount of screen time. Eddie Mora is the only true main character. He's a little eccentric, a little self-centered, more than a little sloppy and perhaps a bit of a slacker. Carl Van Loon (De Niro) ends up becoming a plot engine about halfway through when he hires Eddie, and you might say that he's a form of antagonist. But at the end of the day, he's relatively disposable from Eddie's point of view. I was slightly disappointed with Lindy's (Abbie Cornish) character. She's cast high and is a present figure in Eddie's life, but she is rarely important to the plot and probably deserved a bit more screen time. To make up for this, though, the minor characters are incorporated beautifully. The way Melissa, her brother Vernon, and Gennady (the guy who Eddie goes to before and during\ his stock market surge and ends up on NZT-48) are woven into the plot is great. Not award-winning, but notable. I read a gripe against Eddie's character in another review that said that he never uses his powers to do anything good for medicine or politics. While I see the logic behind this, I would argue that 1) he SPOILER ALERT is in the middle of a campaign at the end, so he's most likely going to be making some kind of political difference, and 2) he's not a superhero and may not have wanted to do anything extraordinarily attention grabbing since he relies almost solely on NZT-48. In that way, maybe Eddie is actually one of the safest people to have use of the pill since, while he doesn't do anything incredibly good with it, he is never really power-hungry or anything like that as someone like Van Loon might be.The story is probably the spot where you can poke the most holes. It has a couple of tangent story lines for how to keep Eddie on NZT-48 and out of danger. There are a couple of technical holes with how the drug works since, logically, it would give Eddie control over things like his pulse. Gennady ends up being a major plot engine near the end. A lot of act two involves Eddie discovering the dangers and detriments of the pill, mostly through his ex-wife Melissa. One plot thread that I thought was done very well was the one about Eddie having to deal with the effects of murdering that one girl during one of his skips. The ending is questionable since you kind of expect Eddie to end up jumping off the roof of his apartment. I still don't really know how to feel about the ending, because it seems like Eddie gets the easy way out. The characters drive it pretty well, but most people won't be completely satisfied with the story as a whole. One possible upside to the story is that it isn't a save-the-world plot, which it definitely could have been if they wanted to make an action movie out of it. This also accounts for Eddie's provincial use of his powers.Execution was a pretty big factor here. The presentation of how NZT-48 worked was interesting and visually appealing, though the latter might not apply to the times where Eddie's mind does 18 hour skips. I felt like the voice-over was used very well here, since it gave good exposition and was used throughout. It can be a little irritating when you have that one voice-over monologue at the beginning of the movie and then it never comes back until the end. The acting was pretty solid from everyone, though it wasn't De Niro's best part. The script was pretty strong, and the couple of action sequences were well done, particularly the subway fight.So for prospective viewers, be conscious that the story might seem a little weak. I don't want to put anything definite on it because it's more a matter of opinion than anything. If you're looking for an interesting plot base, it definitely delivers. The trailer is a pretty good representation of the entire film, which you can't say for every trailer. You definitely want to be serious about watching it and have to worry as little as possible about volume control or external distractions. There are a couple of intense scenes, and one or two that have a possibly nauseating amount of blood in them. I would recommend that you watch it all the way through because you might not like the way it's going at one point, but then the next turn might completely change your mind.

The story also manages with such a big complex plot, not to be confusing and if you didn't catch every bit you would still be able to watch it anyway. Finally on the story I felt that it wasn't too dragged, you get what you predicted to see it kind of go like but they do it well and it doesn't or shouldn't bore you.Bradley Cooper is good in this, he isn't great but his job to lead the cast is fun and he acts like a bit of a player in a sense but he also acts the darker bits too. People like De Niro and Anna Friel are underused but it doesn't really make the film worse really with De Niro not seeming to fit the role very well in truth. Support is OK and to be fair I felt Cooper just has to run the show for most of the time which is OK by the end.Based on a novel it is adapted well with a basic script and some dialogue starts to just sound like there trying too hard to be smart. I loved the direction though and the entire film's artistic level is higher because of the directing. The effects used on this are well done and with a budget that isn't that that high, the effects are great and some shots also used here are so intricate and beautiful. One shot I will point out is when Cooper is stood on top of a building and the camera comes up then over him and back down to his face, done very well indeed.The film could be said as to how I said, it try's to hard to be smart and maybe even attempts to confuse the viewer just to make it seem really really smart. Not too much is bad in this but it could also be said the film is too fast and well the entire piece is, but the ending I personally felt quite rushed and as if they felt they had to speed it up, in the end it is up to you if there is any criticisms though.People who enjoy a complex story will like this and those who enjoy the kind of films where a down and out person suddenly shocks everyone with his skills, well this is definitely for you. It could be said that one part(I won't ruin it) is rather strange and things go on that if you don't understand what is happening you might get lost, this is a part that could annoy film fans. Most should enjoy this and any Cooper fan will also be pleased with his performance too I guess.Overall a 7/10 from me meaning Solidly Good, could have been rated higher but just a few little factors stop it from gaining. This is the kind of film where you can watch and be entertained for just around 105 minutes, sit back and see what happen. In fact you know what with this movie, you should be able to sit back and also just enjoy the intense story that although is never mind boggling, is still worth a watch, and I couldn't recommend it more.",Limitless
124,LloydBayer,"Conceptually original, but somehow incomplete.",7,27 June 2011,"Scientifically, we are known to use between 10-20 % of our brains. However, the who's who in neurochemistry believes this to be a myth. As humans, we supposedly use 100% of brain, but at different times. Then again, that last line would be in obvious reference to the most intelligent of humans. But imagine what it would be like if we could use 100% our brain all the time.Edward Morra (Bradley Cooper) is a down and out writer having failed to meet a deadline in handing in his new book. Worse, Eddie can't find the words to get his book started. On the verge of becoming a 'nobody', Eddie bumps into Vernon Grant, a drug dealer and brother of his ex-wife. Out of goodwill, Vernon offers Eddie an experiential drug called NZT48, claiming it has the ability for humans to harness 100% of the brain's capacity. With nothing to loose, Eddie consumes the pill and within a minute, receives an extra boost to his sensory perceptions. With NZT taking immediate effect, everything becomes absolutely clear to Eddie. From enhanced intelligence to boosted confidence, Eddie is a new man with an alter ego; A highly intelligent superhero of sorts, whose forte lies in 'brain over brawn'. Not only does he publish his book, Eddie ventures into the financial world of stocks and shares and becomes rich at an unbelievable pace. Soon enough, Eddie's blazing pace catches the eye of financial mogul Carl Van Loon (Robert DeNiro). Although Loon is skeptical about Eddie's origins, he employs the latter rather than have to face competition from a rising Wall Street comet.But as it seems, everything has a price. Eddie soon finds himself in a world of trouble. Not only is NZT addictive, withdrawal from the drug is potentially lethal. Eddie also learns that he is not the only person to benefit from this drug. Furthermore, having found Vernon murdered, Eddie walks away with a stash of NZT, only to become a target for multiple assassins.When Bradley Cooper is not hung over from a bachelor party, he is a straight up action junkie or a drama king. This film is ample proof that Cooper is a multifaceted actor. This is also a Bradley Cooper film from beginning to end and will serve as a visual treat for all his female fans. Then there is DeNiro doing what he does best. Having recently cut a niche for himself in comedy, DeNiro is back as the steely eyed nemesis with ulterior motives. As far as acting goes, I have nothing more to report. OK, maybe a quick mention to Abbie Cornish as Eddie's on-off-on girlfriend and Johnny Whitworth as Vernon. All else are forgettable.Based on Alan Glynn's novel ""The Dark Fields"", the concept here is ground breaking. Adapting from this book, Leslie Dixon's screenplay is intriguing for the most part. The script is visually enhanced by mind bending cinematography, some of which include fish-eye images and extensive zooming; Kudos to director Neil Burger for this technical finesse. As a sci-fi thriller with traces of a cloak and dagger feel, Limitless is mostly entertaining and oozes with style, thanks to Cooper's on-screen charisma. Yes, but I also said the screenplay is intriguing for the most part. There is a lot of effort put in to give this movie the look and feel it has and this is evident from start to finish. Somehow, all that effort seems rushed towards the end. The screenplay takes a beating as well. As such, the last 20 minutes seems clichéd and contrived. For lack of better words, I would call it a signature Hollywood ending.If you don't mind the tapered final act, some unanswerable questions and the notion that drugs can make us virtually invincible, then this is quite an entertaining movie with an equally interesting concept.",Limitless
125,johnnymacbest,Well-written and thrillingly acted.,8,27 March 2011,"One of the most endearing surprises of the year. What this film does is take an original premise, and turns it on it's head in ways I never thought possible. I enjoyed this flick from the opening scenes which let's the audience(finally) to get into the main character's head and strangely enough, we end up rooting for him as his life is constantly in danger from unknown assailants and to a greater extent, himself. That's what makes the narrative arc of this film so compelling. The drug itself is simple yet detailed enough to be explained to any interested viewer. On top of that, what makes this film so refreshing is that there's no huge explosions and gratuitous sex scenes that are so prevalent in Hollywood films. In fact this film is almost an anti-Hollywood film and that in this day and age is a MAJOR plus. If you want to see a well-written and thrillingly acted film, see ""Limitless"".

The premise is that a man gets a drug that allows him to take full control of his brain, since we only use about 20% of our brain's actual power. So he basically knows everything, he can also go back into his mind and remember anything that happened to him in the past. The acting is great, Bradley Cooper, Robert De Niro, Abbie Cornish were all good. The action was entertaining and the visuals were minimal but very well handled. However, since it has such great things about it, the film just didn't have the punch that I was expecting. I was hoping for something mindblowing and what I got was a good movie, that stopped short of being great.

128,nickmesafilms,Limitless (2011) - A Drug that Has Mental Focus Powers? Count Me In!,9,21 November 2011,"After becoming a household name in the highly successful movie, ""The Hangover"", Bradely Cooper delivers the performance of a lifetime in one of the best movies of the year. ""Limitless"" stars Cooper as a troubled writer who discovers a top-secret drug which allows him to have natural super human abilities with mental focus. Throughout the movie, he discovers to see things that no other human being has seen. He starts having big money, beautiful women, and giant success. But then the drug brings some side effects, and has to deal with a Wall Street power broker, portrayed by Robert De Niro. Bradely Cooper is just phenomenal in this movie, and I hope he deserves total Oscar consideration for a performance that required a lot of skill, charm, charisma, and smart timing. Abbie Cornish was quite well-acted in this movie, as Cooper's in-and-out girlfriend. Robert De Niro is just timeless in this movie, and he's like one of the best cinema actors you expect to see in a movie. Leslie Dixon has created a well-deserving script that's both well-written and well-accomplished. Also, the cinematography is fast-paced in such a brilliant way, the editing is quite great, the music is non-stop perfection, and the effects are like no other. Director Neil Burger has made a movie with a lot of smart expectations, thrilling moments that keep you on the edge of your seat, and tons of screen time for Bradely Cooper. ""Limitless"" is indeed one of the best movies of the year. ""Limitless"", in my review, ""an exhilarating thrill ride, edge-of-your-seat fun"".",Limitless
129,dvc5159,What the screenplay writers needs is one of them pills...,6,14 April 2011,"Time and time again Hollywood has delivered many an exciting mainstream blockbuster with an intriguing premise - this one is no exception. A pill that allows people to access 100% of their brain... who does not want that, the answer to all of life's problems? Or so it seems...Unfortunately, this very ingenious (and admittedly, mostly desirable) premise isn't completely fleshed out due to the middling screenplay. Judging from the talent involved - Bradley Cooper, Robert De Niro and director Neil Burger - the screenplay never really gels together and is sadly about as coherent as a forgettable blockbuster (if there is such a term).Which is a shame, really. Cooper shows high amounts of charm and charisma in his first non-ensemble lead role, and he proves he has the chops to carry a big film by himself. Abbie Cornish has nothing to do apart from being the obligatory love interest, but De Niro never really unleashes his true chops and becomes nothing more than a two-dimensional character. As for the production value - design, music, editing and cinematography - top notch and slick, as usual for a movie of this type. I especially admired the visual effects of the continuous and extended zoom, it seemed like the camera really knows no boundaries.The screenplay, oh why did it cop out? There was so much potential in it - if the pill can exploit 100% of the human brain, we should have seen more effects and consequences of the pill - more philosophical thinking, and how would this affect his new life - but no. All we got is a story of greed and addiction - nice job taking a jab at all those medicinal addictions, but the screenplay seriously needed more work. And where did those pesky Russian thugs come from?In short, it's quite disappointing. Somewhere in this okay movie is a great movie screaming to come out. But then, for all its slick and glossy finish, it's too two-dimensional to be intelligent, but it's definitely a little food for thought.Overall value: 64/100",Limitless
130,gary-444,"Great idea, dreadful execution",4,29 July 2013,"This is one of the most frustrating films I have seen in a long time. The premise is of the invention of a drug , NZT,which maximises the brain's potential offering huge creative and financial advantage to those that take it. However an awful screen play by Leslie Dixon is crippled by the straight jacket of Hollywood's formulaic demands which the Director, Neil Burger, is unable to resist.Lead actor, Bradley Cooper as Eddie Mora, tries his best with a script which engages and intrigues with its concept at the start, then becomes lost in a series of unbelievable plot twists. His rise to fame and fortune, and the price he pays for it, is reminiscent of stories about those gifted with extraordinary wealth or opportunity. But each page of plot development creaks. The impecunious out of work writer is dumped by his girlfriend, but soon he will be able to have any girl he wants, so that is OK. Money doesn't buy him happiness? Really? But it does buy you a better class of misery.Robert de Niro appears unsatisfactorily as a ruthless business mogul in a crude , underwritten role, simply to add some muscle to the cast. The story loses interest in the sci-fi dimension quite quickly to become a thriller, then a crime caper, and finishes with an awful bolted on feel-good schmaltzy ending. The idea is a 9/10, the execution a 3/10, saved by some good special effects and solid production values.",Limitless
131,troyputland,Bradley Cooper is a capable front-man.,8,14 August 2015,"Limitless is Bradley Cooper's first crack at a leading role. He pulls it off as a head strong, cocky man, on the upward slope after coming in to contact with a drug that releases 100% of his brain's ability. The drug is the captivating yet corrupt attraction, with Cooper's freshly obtained confidence and comatose knowledge being something we'd love to experience. Blah's (Cooper) rapid ascent has its setbacks though. Juggling a relationship with unchecked intelligence, a crazed Russian on his case and a stock exchange job under Robert De Niro threatens to engulf a simple plot. Instead, director Neil Burger manages to unravel it neatly by soundly crossing them over. The script is direct, aided by Cooper's voice-over and the plot's enhanced by firm acting. Unlocking the brain's full power could take us to places unimaginable. Thankfully a realistic approach is taken to avoid doubt amongst its viewers.",Limitless
132,eshwarmail,Interesting concept but it felt that it could have been a lot more.,7,6 January 2017,"Reviewed July 2011It vaguely reminded me of Groundhog Day at some level. It taps into everybody's dream of being super smart and skipping the lengthy process of learning and having an answer to everything. A lazy unmotivated and just got dumped Eddie comes across a pill that can make him very smart and suddenly his life changes for good. But to sustain it, he needs regular supply of the pills and he is not the only one looking for them and those who are, are willing to go to any lengths to get their hands on them. Bradley Cooper lands a solo star role and does a decent job at it. Robert DeNiro is present only to beef up the openings had Bradley not clicked, anyone could've done DeNiro's role. Seeing Abbie Cornish for the first time, she was terrific especially in the initial breakup scene. The plot as it's title tries to take the premise to explore limitless options but ends up going in circles for a little while. A movie can either be a thriller or a mystery, the one that tries to be both needs exceptional handling or might end up in mediocrity. This one falls a little to the latter. Moving on to positive aspects of the movie, it had exceptional presentation, apt performances but a little confused direction with an end that left a lot to be desired. It is still an entertaining thriller for most part of it, which definitely could've been a lot more.",Limitless
133,Ryan_MYeah,"Though not perfect, it dazzles thanks to Cooper, and a stylish visual tone.",8,30 August 2011,"Truth be told, as I was writing this review, I was kind of drawing a blank of what to open with. Such may also be the case of an early dilemma of the lead character from my latest viewing, Limitless.Bradley Cooper plays Edward Morra, a New York writer who has hit a road block. Upon a chance meeting with an ex family member, he's given a mysterious pill (NZT, as it's called) that allows its user the brain activity of a super computer. Coming across a secret stash of the drug, Edward uses it to climb a long rope line of international business, placing him in the spotlight, both a good and a bad thing. Good, because it ensures him a huge fortune, celebrity, and his relationship with his girlfriend (Played by Abbie Cornish), but bad because it places him in the sight of criminals who seek to use the drug for their own foul purposes.To say that Limitless is perfect would be untrue, but it never claims to be. For what it is, it succeeds. It establishes a tone, is able to thrill and charm despite a sometimes uneven narrative, and really makes a lot from its ideas. Not everything in the screenplay is fully fleshed out, but the ambition behind the premise helps it rise above that.And as someone who's normally not a big fan of Bradley Cooper, I couldn't imagine him not doing this role. He's able to utilize a distinctive sense of charisma when need be, but also able to tone it down when dealing with stronger moments within the film. He's surrounded by a talented supporting cast, including co-stars Abbie Cornish and Robert De Niro, and he blends with them nicely, making the most out of every situation.I also must make note of director Neil Burger's visual style. It kind of struck me like Michael Mann if he'd adopted the visual approach of Terry Gilliam. The editing really puts a lively pace into the film, and the special effects add a clever sense of atmosphere. Special mention has to go out to DP Jo Willems. Aside from the trippy, kinetic zoom-throughs of local environments, he shoots scenes where Edward isn't under the effects of the drug with a dark tint, but films scenes where Edward IS under the effects with a broad, bright color spectrum, adding an effective visual depth to a solid piece of popcorn entertainment......and if that's what you're looking for, then I give Limitless my recommendation with *** out of ****",Limitless

135,digdog-785-717538,"Very entertaining, very well made",8,23 April 2011,"I'm glad to see this film climb back from a shallow 6.5 to its deserved vote. Limitless(this is going to be a short review)is a nice story, well executed, but certainly not a film for everyone - the drug culture overtones are sure to ring differently according to each viewer's experiences. The story itself has a nice hook - average joe takes wonder drug, becomes exceptional in everything, then the plot develops, and until now the film is well above standard; Robert deNiro makes an appearance, god cinema until now - frankly, with this setup (plot allows for complex dialogue, great scenery, even fight scenes!) the rest of the film could have been complete crap and still the end result would have been enjoyable.Anyway, after deNiro shows up, you know the film has to take a direction, and the one chosen by Limitless is far from the worse that the writer could have chosen - they could have gone with the tragic love gained through the drug, crime dealers showing up, or self destruction through greed, and a few more - but the film soldiers on and delivers good entertainment and some nice thrills too. DeNiro manages to not overshadow everyone, and throughout Bradley Cooper performs above the mark.Limitless might not be your cup of tea; it might be too long, or not fantastic enough, or simply boring. But for many this will be one of the best -themed films they will see, blowing out of the water Fear and Loathing, Scanner Darkly, Naked Lunch, and the rest.My vote 8/10, feel free to add or subtract a couple points based on your personal inclinations.",Limitless

Your basically a God, who has the power to do so much more than before, and leaving behind all of your problems. But we forgot all the side effects... So your telling me that one man will take this pill, to do what again? He gets into the financial business, but only gaining things for him, leaving all the other people's possibilities limited. What aggravated me the most was how paper-thin everybody was. I'm serious, and I usually never complain about character development. I enjoyed Bradley Cooper's role, but everybody else just fell short, ESPECIALLY Robert De Niro. The acting from everybody was good, though, and the movie moved along with a brisk place.. But only to be haunted by those plot holes. Limitless has a limitless amount of these, and almost ruining my experience. If it weren't for the beautiful cinematography and the great editing, Limitless would be passed off as another average film, nothing more. The concept was intriguing though, VERY intriguing. The movie had loads of potential beforehand, and the trailer showed me a different point of view. Now your probably expecting this to be a bad review, but no, the movie didn't disappoint me all around. I love the addition of the narration. It worked on the same level of Fight Club, whereas it enhances the experience of the film. It opens up another end of character development, and Cooper's character was probably the only one we get to get along with. The film's editing was great as well, but some parts made me thing otherwise. The last note I'd like to touch is the ending... Wow, what a horrible ending. I thought the movie would've passed along another 10 minutes, but it ended at that point where it seriously makes you over think the experience of the film. It was laughable, as it doesn't even fit with the rest of the film. So your expecting us to believe that he has engineered a new drug that has the same capabilities and NO side-effects? Your expecting a lot.. but still. Limitless was expected more for me, but for what it is, I enjoyed it minus the plot holes. It's a different kind of movie and it makes you think of it's themes. What IF you had the power to access 100% of your brain? Sounds great, except Cooper doesn't know exactly how to invest into it. 6/10.",Limitless

My only reason to see the film was this guy. The film also provides a plot which has endless possibilities. Eddie is a normal guy who is struggling to do something significant in his life. Getting desperate more and more, he finds a drug which enhances the capabilities of your brain. How this drug turns his life upside down in a proper cosine wave format is what the entire film is about. I know it sounds rubbish, normal sci-fi. But there are certain things which make the film a little bit interesting and make itself worthy for at least one time watch. First of all the effects are good, innovative and something which is not too star war types but which we can perceive visually in a good aesthetic manner. Bradley cooper himself has done amazing in his role as a struggling person. The narrative pattern of the film is also binding, where cooper himself narrates his life. I still think that in this way the audience gets more interested. Apart from these good parts, I felt like the information was too much in the short span of the film. Many details of the novel would have been tried to stuff into the screenplay. And not all were impressive and they just contributed towards the hurriedness and the abruptness at the same time to the film. The ending was clichéd and I was expecting something different so that also was a letdown. But in all the film is fast paced, gripping and a definite one time watch for all action lovers.

This film uses special effects which are stunningly clever and often a little nauseating and the story line is full of clever twists and turns because it is concentrating on what really may happen if such an event occurred. From that perspective it is excellent.But there are flaws in such a plot line which only partially developed the side effects themes, and, at points in the plot simply kicked them into touch as they got in the way of a good yarn. To taste the side effects is one thing but to suddenly ask us to believe they have been removed and not replaced by other side effects is simply spoiling what could have been a totally excellent film. Continuity is a little careless at times too.As it is the film is still worth watching and enjoying although I believe it could have been even better in more subtle hands.

He then stumbles upon a past acquaintance who introduces him to an experimental drug that could change his life forever. The intriguing proposition of the story centers around this pharmaceutical experiment that optimizes brain usage to 100% from the meager 20% that we normally use. The problem, that we soon discover, is that supply is limited..... and restricted.Eddie (Bradley Cooper)'s attempts to write a novel go in vain and his inability to push himself to seek refinement is evident with his apartment, his relationship with his otherwise focused girlfriend and his dependent finances. At such a juncture, he stumbles upon his ex- brother-in-law who introduces an experimental designer drug that enhances brain functionality to harness all its potential. As he is then confronted by his landlord's wife who yaks at him for the pending rent, Eddie chooses an intelligent escape by taking one of the pills and then, whatever he has seen, heard, read or experienced in his life, is available to him as reference. Knowledge acquisition is rapid and so is its retention. Eddie soon discovers that he can achieve the impossible like Bruce Almighty and as greed takes over, he seeks to exploit the financial markets to make some astronomical gains. Overnight success draws inquisitive eyes of the ambitious and Eddie would need to maintain a low profile if he doesn't want to expose his secret to his phenomenal analytical abilities. Veteran investor Carl Loon (Robert De Niro) employs Eddie and gives him the incredible opportunity to make it to the big league in a very short time. Just when it all seems to be going his way, Eddie realizes that the pills have an adverse effect on his health and without a regular intake, he would almost lose his life. To add to that, he is pursued by a goon who now knows the secret to his supreme abilities and demands more pills for himself. There is always some danger lurking around the corner in Limitless. Even though, the idea of an intelligence enhancing medication seems like the ultimate strength, one always feels restless and is aware of some form of imminent threat. It just seems too good to be true and that is primarily what grips you through this well paced screenplay. The film looks great with the camera speeding through the streets and the stunning views of New York city. The mood resembles that of Neil Burger's previous film, 'The Illusionist' and this one is equally intriguing, if not more. The background score is well suited to the film's pulsating situations. The beautiful Abbie Cornish plays the tense situations quite well and in confrontational scenes with Cooper, she emerges strong. Robert De Niro gets a Michael Douglas type role where he seems to enjoy throwing his power around. Good to see him threatening people around him because that is what he does best..... Bradley Cooper took complete advantage of the opportunity where he can play a definitive lead and he is quite convincing both as the struggling author and the coolest man in town with higher intelligence. Director Neil Burger keeps the momentum going while keeping us glued with suspense, action and twists. A novel idea is simplified in his execution and he makes it easy to absorb it as a reality right from the beginning. He does avoid superficial scenarios and unnecessary drama and chooses to portray the hardships that Eddie encounters while he possesses such power. Limitless entertains with the possibilities and the consequences of uncontrollable powers. However, in the end, it is no 'Inception' in story telling or concept and if you're in with unreal expectations, it will surely disappoint but due credit must be given to Neil Burger for a good execution of the concept that even in the end, doesn't fall flat on its face. 8.081 on a scale of 1-10.",Limitless

A lot of my friends wanted to see this, and I had no idea this movie even existed (I don't watch TV).Right off the bat, the film opens much in the same vein as Kick-Ass, where we see a skyscraper and someone standing up on top of it: this time being our main protagonist Edward Mora. He's contemplating on jumping during an inner monologue as a bunch of thugs are trying to break into his apartment. Of course, we go into a flashback, seeing a down-on-our-luck Bradley Cooper being a loser and drinking and throwing up on his boss. His hot girlfriend breaks up with him, giving us some exposition on how she got the job as an editor. Edward himself is trying to write a book, but he's suffering from writer's block.Immediately he runs into the brother of his previous marriage, Verne. He claims to quit drug dealing, but it turns out he has a new kind of drug that accesses a hundred percent of your brain. Edward resists, but Verne passes him the drug anyway. With nothing going for him, Edward downs the pill and tests out the ability with his landlord's wife who constantly nags at him for not paying his rent. When the drug takes effect, Edward access points where he absorbed knowledge, mentions her law school studies, and sleeps with her. Soon he's cleaning his apartment, finishes his book, and the next day the effects wear off.Without giving the rest of the movie away, Edward gets a huge supply of the drug and people are after him. Normally I don't like this kind of story, where someone possesses something no one else has and there's these bad guys chasing them for some reason, but here it works. I enjoyed this movie from beginning to end, and halfway through I realized it was telling a STORY and a good one at that. Bradley Cooper does an excellent job here. I hear that originally Shia Labitch was supposed to play this part originally, but he had to bow out due to a motorcycle accident. Thank God. I think Bradley Cooper was the perfect choice for the film, because he's believable. I also have to mention Robert De Niro, who's... well, Robert De Niro but it's great to see him in this movie anyway. He plays this big tycoon that Edward has to schmooze and every one of those scenes were riveting. Excellent writing there.With a fantastic script, a capable director, and wonderful acting, I could only sum up this movie as brilliant. So far, this one is in my top 10 for 2011. The year is early, but the bar has been set this year. I sure hope the rest of the films live up to it.",Limitless
143,mirwais-orbit,Good plot development,8,5 June 2011,"Limitless isn't a common great circuit film, at the same time isn't a movie that offers great information or a grand moral to make people think about life or something, but it is a daring movie that shows the drugs from a different point of view.Eddie Morra (Bradley Cooper) is a writer in creative crisis who discovers a miracle pill that can increase brain synapses and give access to all information acquired since childhood that are stored in the sub-conscious, also increasing the learning curve and the logical reasoning. So, Eddie gets out of his hole that was getting deeper and deeper to a surface of ​​success, fame, power and money. The film shows the ups and downs given by the drug, but unlike movies like Trainspotting (1996), Requien For A Dream (2000), Enter The Void (2009), among several other titles that deal with drug abuse as something extremely harmful and destructive, Limitless tries to make the reverse curve and instead of leaving us depressed as the other titles do, this one let us excited about how far the character can get.The film has a great plot development and a direction that works in all aspects. Again the edition and the soundtrack gives the hallucinogenic elements that offer the ecstasy and anguish of the character without seeming pushed or overdone. Everything in the film is used sparingly. Who would imagine that Bradley Cooper would come out from a show like Alias (2001) to become one of the new stars of this decade? Besides acting convincingly, Bradley also is the executive producer, which is surprising because it shows that besides knowing how to choose great money machines he also knows how to pick a great movie not only to act but also to produce.Limitless is undoubtedly one of the best movies of 2011 and one of the few which deserved its success, although it will probably not be remembered in the future.",Limitless

I really hate movies or TV shows with voice over ""stream of consciousness"" narration. If I hear it I instantly know the show or movie is gonna be awful. And this movie was no exception. Ignore the high ratings it has here - I think that's the result of people being sheep & saying it's good because everyone else thinks so, therefore it must be. Find something else to watch unless you like boring, self- indulgent trippy flicks about drugs - that go nowhere.

145,blacklist-1,An excellent sci-fi thriller that takes you to the limit,10,24 March 2011,"Limitless is for me one of the most original and best sci-fi thrillers to come out in years. This tells the story of first off dishevelled writer Eddie Morra (Bradley Cooper) who lounges in his small messy apartment trying to start his latest novel but unable to do as he suffers from writers block. He is like this for weeks, which turns into months where his current girlfriend Lindy (Abbie Cornish) ends their relationship because of the way he is. By chance on the street Eddie ends up running into his ex-wife's brother Vernon (Johnny Whitworth) who previously dealt in drugs but now works as a consultant for a pharmaceutical company. He offers Eddie a chance to sort his life out by offering him a drug MDT that can access one hundred percent of his brain instead of just the normal human capacity of twenty per cent. He takes it and develops super-human powers where he finds he can finish his book in a speed he never thought before. When the drug runs out in his system, he goes back to Vernon for more but finds he's dead. He then takes the rest of his stash and starts living the high life of being brilliant at everything like he can speak any language and is an expert at finances and the stock market. Due to this he ends up working for Carl Van Loon (Robert De Niro). As Eddie continues taking the drug he starts to develop problems like the drug's side effects and the fact a drug dealer wants the drug to take and sell to his customers. This film really does take you to the limit with an interesting premise. If you had a chance to take MDT to get what you wanted in life would you? If you wanted to do something you knew you could never achieve and taking that drug would help you get it, would you? This concept is explored well to an extent as we start to see Eddie lose control of himself. The thing is it would have been better if the film had gone further. How was MDT created? Who created it? What are it's exact ingredients? But despite this I still absolutely loved this film. Apart from a great story as I said with an interesting premise, it is fantastically shot with some very interesting and unconventional camera shots (particular at the opening credits) which makes it refreshingly different. The pace and tone of the film flew by in terms of some gripping action sequences and plot developments. This had the great notion for me of there never being a dull moment as it developed into unexpected directions. The script was smart and quick-whipped throughout, the music was excellent and the acting was superb particularly by Bradley Cooper who was really convincing in his role with a terrific supporting performance from De Niro and Abbie Cornish who made the most of the little time she had on screen. I loved this film from start to finish as it was terrifically entertaining. Originally I wasn't going to see this but I changed my mind and I'm glad I did. Limitless is the fourth best movie I have seen this year. And I am pleased with the 7.4 IMDb rating it has received so far though it should be higher. Saying that not everyone will like this film, but I did. Just see this for yourself and make up your own mind. But for me it took me and reached it's limit.",Limitless

Embedded with unique computer graphics and cinematography the movie will squeeze in to the viewers mind and drags him along the joy ride just as Eddie experience it. In one scene where Eddie goes on a total 18 hour blackout and suddenly comes back to reality, it feels as if it actually happened to you.

147,hoytyhoyty,Underrated little (flawed) gem - the haters can go to hell,8,8 December 2014,"Limitless is an actual Science-Fiction film, and it's not a bad one at all. I just watched it again, to wash the taste of the fantasy film 'Lucy' (god, what a giant pile of dog poo) out of my mouth.It has three huge plot holes, but they still aren't enough to wreck it.Also the '% of our brain' thing is used properly, and not harped on. Vinny(?) says 'access 20% of our brain' - the operative word being ACCESS, not USE. I've heard it said, and I agree, that 'we live on the surface of ourselves.' But what if we could, holographically, access the whole shebang? The plot holes are: * The first thing he would have done, would have been to guarantee an infinite supply of NZT48 * The Russian would have been a minor problem, dealt with with extreme prejudice in the first week or so * As soon as the side-effects manifested, he would have started investigating them and found out how to mitigate them - the bit about 'just eat and get some sleep' was cheap and annoying. And I *wanted* more side-effects, a whole sub-plot could have been written just there.In general, the limit of Limitless is that they simply don't do enough with it. But it doesn't wreck it, it's still a good story, and I loved its ending. Whether its faults come from the 'Dark Fields' book, or are errors of the producers, I don't know.And it's so beautifully shot and paced - with a fantastic soundtrack - that I was never bored for a moment.Limitless is staying in my collection of Good Stuff, along with Primer, Absentia, Coherence and others.- -- ---",Limitless
148,craig-hopton,"So-so movie with best ""twist"" ever",6,16 March 2013,"This movie has a typical thriller plot - man tries to solve mystery and gets chased by bad guys while doing so. This helps to keep up a steady level of excitement and interest.As thrillers go, however, it's not much to shout about. Bradley Cooper is OK as the unmotivated-wannabe-turned-slick-operator. But the basic idea - that you take a drug to try and become more successful - isn't terribly original.Most of the movie in any case is just taken up by Cooper or his girlfriend running away from things. One of the bad guys, ""The Man in the Tan Coat"" is almost comically robotic in the chase scenes which doesn't help. They could and should have made much more of the big- pharma conspiracy subplot.The ending however, is absolutely inspired. Just when you think the movie is heading towards a moralistic ""drugs can't make you successful"" denouement, Cooper gets away with everything scot-free! He gets the girl and the career and supposedly eliminates the side-effects of the drug. It's brilliantly clever compared to the typical double or triple twists you get in most movies nowadays.

151,dharmendrasingh,"Thrills, spills and pills",7,17 March 2011,"Neil Burger's 'Limitless' is a clever dumb film, which is surprisingly entertaining. It has thrills, spills and pills.Eddie Morra (Bradley Cooper) is a quotidian New York writer. He lives in a decrepit downtown shack, and hasn't written a word in his 'new' book for longer than he remembers. He can't articulate what his book is supposed to be about, but that doesn't stop his delusional grandeur.One day, Eddie bumps into his ex-brother-in-law. They exchange some obsequious patter, before the ex sees Eddie for what he is: a bum. Pitying him, the ex offers him a pill that will change his life forever.Don't ask me how the pill works. Don't even ask the filmmakers. Just know that it does work. The pill enables Eddie to access 100% of his brain, instead of the customary 20%. Random trivia subconsciously stored long ago can now be instantly recalled. Eddie's potential is potentially limitless.We see many examples (the most enjoyable bits) of what these $800 pills can do. Eddie writes his book in four days, extemporises at the piano in three, and learns to speak several languages. He's now the smartest person in the world (implied, not asserted). It's not long before he makes the obvious connection to money. He schmoozes his way into a top energy firm, under the supervision of Carl Van Loon (Robert De Niro).Being the great bastion of solicitude that it is, Hollywood takes its responsibility of highlighting the ills of drug abuse – even one that gives the user genuine powers – seriously. The pill lasts only a few hours, and addiction causes grotesque side-effects.It gets a bit far-fetched when others start taking the pill, and the penultimate scene (which could have been the ending, but thank goodness it wasn't) is profoundly awful. I won't even hint at what it includes; I want you to shriek in disbelief as I did. Absurdity abounds, but it's not a fault because it's within context. Smart dialogue covers up many of the contrivances, and De Niro does more here than he has done for years: he acts without mugging.www.scottishreview.net",Limitless
152,julian-mumford,A pill not so hard to swallow,7,7 April 2011,"If you could take one tablet to make you smarter, faster, more entertaining, probably richer and maybe even sexier, would you take it?Apparently we only use 20% of our brain function, some less than others of course but imagine if you could suddenly use all of it. Everything you ever learned, read or seen, instantly at your disposal with the communication skills and confidence to match.Struggling New York writer Eddie Morra (Bradley Cooper) is faced with this dilemma, not for long, as the pill is on the way down before you can say, was that FDA approved? Suddenly Morra can finish his book, start trading derivatives and complex financial instruments, whilst learning several languages and getting a hair cut.In a nicely played moving montage, it is clear he has made it or is certainly well on his way.Of course this is a movie, so the path to true success and happiness cannot run true and many scenarios are thrown in his way before the well played and slightly ambiguous denouement.If you can get through the opening nausea inducing credits, this a fun film which does not take itself too seriously. Plenty of thrills and spills and whilst dabbling in the ethical dilemma the screenplay poses, it stays firmly in the shallow end, leaving deeper waters to other films.Of course with so many illegal substances freely available in many parts of the world, the opening question is somewhat moot, the answer increasingly being, hell yeah. Of course whilst the real life upside is likely to be lessened, the downside is about the same, albeit without hit-men attempting to assassinate you in most cases.Cooper, a late replacement for an injured Shia Le Beouf, does well in his first starring role. Perhaps not a true breakout role but another solid entry into his filmography and increasing star status.The film does veer off track when the inevitable downside and side effects present themselves, few moviegoers like watching ""Junkie"" acting but the story picks up a good head of steam for a rousing send off.It is good to see De Niro back on the screen although solid, he adds little star power here. Lindy (Abbie Cornish) adds more to the proceedings as Morra's long suffering girlfriend.The violence is occasionally more than you are expecting but the transformation of a Eastern block drug dealer (Howard) is rather amusing to watch.""More finesse, I like that word, I did not know it before"" Summary Good fun with a neat concept that it is not fully utilized but provides a solid couple of hours of entertainmentEnjoyable, entertaining and confirms that Cooper might yet become a true star, even before the inevitable ""Hangover 2"" arrives.http://julesmoviereviews.blogspot.com/",Limitless

It happens to Eddie Morra (Bradley Cooper), a desperate writer who facing a dead end in his career. The unexpected event introduces him to the magic pill which allows him to access 100% of his brain. The next thing he knows, he is able to complete his writing in just one night. In fact, his mind also becomes super smart and an effective analyzer. Now all things are easy, He can fix his fractured relationship with his girlfriend Lindy (Abbie Cornish), having a lifetime opportunity to work with successful tycoon investor like Carl Van Loon (Robert De Niro). It becomes worse when other people try to take advantage of him and his magic pill. One word for Bradley Cooper, he is awesome! All thiz time, I always thought that Bradley Cooper can be successful as is now just because he is good-looking, thiz time he has proved me wrong. Cooper definitely can describe highs and lows of his complex character. On the other hand, Robert De Niro delivers his typical persona as a charismatic and influential figure. And even though in brief performance, Abbie Cornish can bring out her sex appeal attractively. Neil Burger is the man behind thiz interesting thriller. Burger is formerly known for ""The Illusionist"" (2006) and ""The Lucky Ones"" (2008).Burger has successfully provided a dynamic storytelling with compelling narrative. The instrumental song that sounds ""Da da da da Da da da"" will be one of the memorable characteristics of thiz movie, in addition to ""Infinite Zoom Sequence"" that appears in the opening credits. Everything is grand, except one thing, the ending! The storyline is very nicely built since the very beginning but I can obviously see that they run out of ideas to conclude thiz story. The ending could have been better. Anyway, As far as I know, the only way to reach thiz kind of state is by mediation, not medication.

As if advancing the plot trough an insane amount of narration wasn't enough, most of the dialog is still used up for exposition giving you the feeling that you are listening to a dumbed-down audio book. The rest of the dialog is just plain uninteresting. The great central idea of a perfectly functioning brain that is supposed to be the main point of interest in this movie is wasted in the most unimaginative way, almost exclusively on short montages repeatedly utilizing the same visual effect, providing what is merely a video background while the lead is reading the story to you.If you want to get this certain experience and don't like to read, I'd honestly recommend the audio book if there is one.

161,eve_dolluk,"Limitless, slightly Limited",7,21 March 2011,"The film centres around a hapless writer Edward Morra who is struggling to write his book, the publishers is slowly getting impatient and no matter how hard e tries the words just don't seem to be coming his way. On top of that his girlfriend Lindy has decided enough is enough. Then a chance encounter with his ex brother in law Vernon leads him to start taking a pill. One that will change his life forever.The idea for the story is that by taking a pill you can use all the synapses of the brain rather than the 20 % we can utilise now but like most drugs there are side effects.The film force feeds you all you need to know in small snippets of visual aids and also a narrative from Bradley Cooper ( Edward ). This means you do not have to think to much about what is going on, instead you watch you listen and enjoy his journey.The pacing is good and you never lose interest or get confused about what is happening, its all there in bite size chunks for you to ingest. The film has drug abuse overtones although these are subtle they are apparent and one scene highlights this. However this is not a film that wants you to pass judgement or think to much, what you get is a popcorn flick with an IQ above average.... barely.There are many flaws with the story telling that at times leave you questioning certain actions of characters, the good news is that the pacing of the film means you don't get much time to think them through as you are now focused on the next scene and the next e.t.cThe performances are pretty good Bradley Cooper plays a different role from his usual romcom affair but as usual the focus on his baby blues take precedent. DeNiro has little to do except play the tough corporate achiever. Abbie Cornish who plays Eddie's GF is pretty expressionless but solid nevertheless. Anna Friel was rather underused as was Thomas Arana ( did he speak ). Andrew Howard who plays an eastern European money lender and all round bad guy hams it up and pulls it off rather well but overall everyone knows there part and does what is asked. The things you will enjoy about this film is the pacing and the overall concept and lets not forget this is a concept film. It does not delve deep into the human psyche nor does it open your eyes to something great. What it does do is provide 90 Min's of sharp entertainment combined with a bit of action and decent cinematography. The things you may dislike is the lack of depth and the force fed storyline although I can see for many that this will be a bonus.I've given it a 7, I was entertained and it was a polished popcorn flick with a little more depth than most. Its not going to upset anyone or make you jump and applaud so just sit back and enjoy the movie.",Limitless
162,thewillt08,Solid but Forgettable.,6,11 May 2013,"Imagine if there was a drug that could make you do anything you want. Now imagine if they made a movie about it. Limitless start Bradley Cooper and is a thoroughly entertaining. The story was very interesting but it was obvious the drug would be too good to be true. Characters paths were easily predicted but I was able to sit through the entire thing, which is always a plus.Bradley Cooper has done a great job in launching his career past The Hangover. This isn't his best performance but he has natural charisma on screen and this was proof that he could handle a serious role. I will say this right now; if Limitless did not have Bradley Cooper then Silver linings Playbook would not have been as great as it was. I feel that Limitless was less of a movie but more of a test for Bradley Cooper, and in my opinion, he passed with flying colors.Cooper plays a struggling writer looking for his big break. I expected his life to go from bad to worse before he got the pill but it didn't. The movie jumped right into it and got down to business. I liked that but there still left the questions with obvious answers. Once he has the drug it is obvious he needs a large supply and fast. The plot builds up the character who supplies the drug then he gets written off. Spoiler alert, he dies, its not a big deal and any idiot with half a brain could have figured it out. The last time we see him alive his apartment is a mess and he has a bump on his head. The movie foreshadows his death and Cooper inheriting his problems that come with the drug. These problems are the Russian gangsters he gets in association with. It never made sense to me why he got involved with them, but he did and after he became a millionaire, got his girl back, had job after job opportunities, they give him a reality check and prove to be the ""bad guys"" in the movie. I wasn't a huge fan of the Russians in general, I feel like they were unnecessary. The focus on them was weird because I expected the movie to focus more on Robert De Niro. When he made his first appearance I paid extra attention because I expected the movie to get real and more intense. I was hoping it would be way more intense than camping, but it proved to be highly disappointing. The big flaw with Limitless was the lack focus on a primary antagonist. There were the Russian and De Niro, but they were both on the same level. One should have been above the other in terms of deviance and importance. There were plot holes with these characters and the movie failed to impress. The story took a few turns I did not expect but a problem in the story was solved too easily. The pill almost killed Cooper but his solution isn't to not take it anymore, it's to take it on a lesser dosage and not abuse it. That made no sense to me. How does a big problem like that just disappear? This drug had a major impact and seemed so strong and t was became regulated within a few minutes. People died from this drug and Cooper learns how to control it with a snap of the fingers? I don't think so. That is lazy writing. I don't know what I liked better, the wit of Bradley Cooper, or the way the camera works and how I felt when the drug was taking effect of Cooper. The visuals and the way the camera moves when the drug is being used made me feel like I was on it myself. The speeding thru time and sideways view on everything and the flashes were fantastic. It took me on a trip. On the other hand the pill made Cooper talk with such confidence and tenacity that only he can pull off as an actor. Overall, Limitless was a movie that is incredibly difficult to pull off. Bradley Cooper was the right choice as the lead, a few mishaps in the writing and lack of other characters hurt the movie as a whole, but it was still enjoyable. Cooper was great and he built up chemistry with De Niro and that was another big part of the success of Silver Linings Playbook. I suggest you see this movie at least once. Don't jump from your couch do see it immediately. You can see it whenever and it will gave the same impact. No matter when you see it you will forget it within a week. Limitless gets the WillyT Recommendation.",Limitless
163,robinski34,The Living End,7,19 July 2014,"Bradley Cooper's character does not evoke much sympathy in the first act, but that is probably the point, he's a rather tiresome nobody, suddenly transformed by the wonder drug that he acquires from his brother-in-law (isn't it always the way). Neil Burger crafts a pacey, good looking film from Leslie Dixon's screenplay from Alan Glynn's novel ""The Dark Fields"" stimulating some interesting questions in the viewer, as the best films do. It's an interesting idea, played out with great style and high energy. Cooper's narration is well handled, managing not to annoy, allowing us to concentrate on the action. There are some dizzying visuals that are highly effective, adding to a feeling of freshness. The main characters are all engaging, with good support from Robert de Niro (not stretched), Abbie Cornish, Andrew Howard, and the very watchable Anna Friel. There are perhaps a couple of minor gripes - for one thing, there's a feeling of rampant wish fulfilment about some of the sequences which, even in a fantasy film, seems a bit of a stretch. Also, as any writer knows, blank page syndrome in the very literal way it appears here, is utter nonsense.

165,cmoyton,"Pills , Thrills and Bellyaches",9,24 September 2011,Just read on the Did You Know section that Shia LaBoeuf almost had the lead role in this. Praise be for that injury as Bradley Cooper was perfect for the lead role. Admittedley it does not have much competition but Limitless is one of the best movies released in 2011. Pitched predominantly as a thriller it also is humorous and satirical. I loved the simple but effective camera shots simulating the effect of popping the pills ( the speeded up street journey and letters falling on screen) and the soundtrack was spot on.De Niro plays second fiddle here and in an underplayed performance he could have been subbed by any number of 50 something actors. Make no mistake it is Coopers movie. Segments of Limitless reminded me of The Game and The Dead Zone and i admired the slightly ambiguous ending. Just what will Eddie Morra do with all that power? Please lets not find out. How can you improve on near perfection?,Limitless

I guess I probably only used 20% or less of my brain the first time.:-) I watched it again last night and found it was quite entertaining. Roger Ebert did not give too good a praise. His reason was the movie should focus on the comprehension of human brain not the memory. I think he got the point. How the brain connect the existed information to generate solutions to the problems would be a more logical approach to the whole story.

167,edwbur,limited at best,1,27 March 2011,"this movie is without a doubt the worst movie of the year. the movie is about a struggling out of luck writer, who while walking down the street sees his ex brother in law who later on gives him a pill that can access all of his brain. he says its FDA approved. who would believe that. Eddie would. Eddie is the struggling writer. anyway he takes one, then when he needs more he finds his brother in law dead in an apartment. that may give him a hint to stop taking them. but instead steals the last batch that he has in his house and takes them. now in the film you don't find out who made them and how they were made. your some how supposed to ignore that. anyway he becomes a smart stock guy and robert deniros character wants him to work for his company and with him. the storyline is ludicrous and the acting is horrible. the only bright spot is robert deniro. in every movie he does he gives a great performance. even if the movie sucks. this movie including. some how i have no idea how it made it to the top of the box office chart. its a waist of money. don't see it.",Limitless
168,MovieGuyFunTime,Enjoyable and good performances. Some logic issues though.,7,18 February 2018,"I really enjoyed this movie and Robert De Niro was especially good in my opinion. Lots of great acting and action and the suspense was really there. The only problem I had with it was: why did he need a $100k loan from the Russian loan shark? He turns a little money into several thousand in a few days by ""quintupling it"" in the stock market but he only has a few thousand now. But if he""quintupled"" this principal every few days, he would have $100k in no time at all. I fail to see why he needed to risk his life with a loan shark to get money he could have made in the market relatively quickly at the rate he was going. I suppose it was because the film needed the baddies.Other than that, I really liked it. Bradley Cooper is awesome!",Limitless
169,jonnyhavey,Cooper: Back Again and Again,8,21 March 2011,"""Limitless"" is only concerned about one thing and that is being really really cool. This is one of the only movies that has come out recently that has successfully ran with a cool idea by avoiding throwing in all sorts of unnecessary nonsense. The script is well written by Leslie Dixon based off of the novel ""The Dark Fields"" by Alan Glynn, Bradly Cooper (""The A-Team"", ""The Hangover"") was well casted, and Director Neil Burger raps it together into smart entertaining fun. Cooper plays a man named Eddie Mora who is an aspiring failure of a writer. He has just gotten dumped by his girlfriend Lindy (Abbie Cornish ""Sucker Punch"") and doesn't know where to turn. This leads him to a chance encounter with his ex-wife Melissa's (Anna Friel, ""Goal"") brother Vernon (Johnny Whitworth, ""3:10 to Yuma"") who is known for being involved in the drug game. After a brief meeting, Morra is given a sample of a new drug called NZT-48 that is supposed to open up his brain allowing him to use his full brain capacity increasing his focus and intellect. At first he is very skeptical, however, he is curious and knows that he needs to do something to get out of his downwardly spiraling existence. Needless to say he takes the pill opening up a world of achievement, greed, and danger that is limitless. His life is back on track as he gets his girlfriend Lindy back and is becoming a multi-millionaire, however, isn't there always a drawback? Yes there is as Morra gets more and more involved, his health is at risk and he becomes a marked man.Eddie Morra was a character perfectly crafted for Bradley Cooper. Cooper is looked at as a hotshot, rugged, talented alluring actor mixing comedy, action and drama within his roles. Without Cooper ""Limitless"" would lose its charismatic vibe and would not be nearly as good. The film itself is very captivating and doe not have a dull moment. It achieves this with consistent nonstop strings of entertaining sequences meshed together with exquisite film editing. Film editing is used in a number of ways in order to visually represent distinctions within the human mind. It explicitly distinguishes between full awareness of an opened eyed individual and the foggy state of a closed eyed individual. Depressing, nonsense drama is avoided in the film as well differentiating the film from a stereotypical movie about a junkie. Also, what makes a movie like this better? Cast a seasoned actor like Robert De Niro as a big-time businessman.First of all many viewers may say that the story has been told before, however, this does not affect the movie. One problem that the film does have is failing to fully explain the role of certain characters. Some characters are overlooked very quickly and as the movie turns towards new developments most evident with Robert John Burke's character Pierce. Also, Abbie Cornish's casting as Morra's girlfriend Lindy was not the best choice leading to a very average performance. Yes she does what she is meant to do, however her portrayal is very one-dimensional and ultimately unimportant.The basic outline of ""Limitless's"" plot has been seen before, however, this is not just another movie about a junkie who discovers power and is in danger of losing it. Cooper's charm keeps Morra coming back again and again as he finds the answers to his limitless potential. It is movies like this that define the entertainment of cinema, however, the art of the movie's film editing may be commended as well at the Oscars.",Limitless
170,nlytnd_1,"Limitless potential, limited execution, however the concept and the cinematography carry it just enough to make it a movie I'm glad I finally watched.",7,20 March 2020,"Even though I'm glad I watched this movie, I can't help but feel the disappointment of something that could have been significantly better, which I'm sure most viewers echo this sentiment....And man!... did this have some gargantuan plot holes. I wouldn't completely disagree with a viewer who couldn't get beyond it. I probably wouldn't have if this type of thing wasn't so typical in movies, however they should be pointed out.
Somehow homeboy, using his brain to the max, never accounted for running out of pills... perhaps figuring out a way to get or manufacture more? Eddie even runs out at the worst possible times (not once but twice) in which he knew would happen if all went well with the meeting (with Carl Van Loon- the De Nero character), so why put yourself in a situation on your run out day, knowing that you will look like a jackhole when you can't deliver? I won't even get into the nonsense with the Russian dude.
And man!... did it seem like they cut out a chunk of this movie or ran out of time. Apparently Eddie establishes more of a relationship/partnership/rivalry with the Carl then the viewer ever gets to see. So for this movie to end with Eddie one upping/beating Carl makes very little sense, since such a rivalry was never established. And lastly....a politician? Talk about limitations.",Limitless
171,garyvanhorn,I wasn't interested in the movie until I actually watched it. Phenomenal.,9,14 September 2011,"Limitless is one of those movies I was really interested to see, until I read the synopsis. Wow a pill that allows you to use 100% of your brain.....LAME! It was with some hesitation that I rented the film but the next two hours I was entranced by a movie that is impeccable. Everything about the film sings, the characters, the acting, the plot all expertly crafted, guiding the audience through an incredible rags-to-riches story that is far more entertaining than the cliché might seem.Eddie Mora ( Bradley Cooper) is a writer, well he wants to be one anyway. He has a book deal but just can't seem to get over his writer's block, or organize his apartment, or pay the rent, or keep his girlfriend, or do anything else constructive with his life. He's not a total failure but is one step away from becoming one. All of that changes when he bumps into his shady ex-brother-in-law (Johnny Whitworth) who happens to have the answer to all his creative problems. When Mora takes one little pill, everything changes. His thoughts become clearer, everything he ever half-read is remembered, cataloged, and ready for use in his now perfectly running mind. He becomes motivated, he knows what to do and how to do it, the possibilities for him become Limitless, especially after he joins forces with energy mogul Carl Van Loon (Robert De Niro).I know, I know, it still sounds lame, but trust me, it isn't. Much like Zodiac (not The Zodiac which sucks big time) Limitless is a great film, mostly because it is made so well made, which elevates the subject matter to a whole other level. The drug isn't perfect, Eddie Mora's life becomes filled with intrigue, danger, mystery and murder and his newly found intelligence is both the cause and the cure. Check out Limitless, you won't regret it.",Limitless

It becomes very annoying...why is Bradley Cooper's character talking to us...there was no set-up for this. In old movies, the character at least is shown to be in a police station at the beginning of a film and we see him telling a story to the cops.Despite the narration, the film is mildly interesting with it's premise of a drug that makes one super-aware. The picture moves along at a quick pace until 3/4 the way through, where lots of loose ends are tied up a little too neatly and a little too conveniently.",Limitless

The charismatic Cooper carries the movie on his shoulders as he inhabits his character perfectly and makes the movie a treat to watch. On receiving a mysterious drug which supposedly allows an individual to access 100 percent of his brain, Bradley Cooper's character is able to complete a novel in 4 days by taking this wonder pill. As his ambitiousness grows, he decides to use his deductive skills to make some quick money in the stock market. Even though the effects of the drug made a remarkable turnaround in his life, its side-effects were starting to show up which happened on withdrawal of the drug. The flaw in this movie is that a lot of action seems to happen at a convenient time and it seems a little unrealistic. Also, at the end we do not know the whereabouts of the people in his home. The movie was a decent one but do not have exceedingly high expectations.",Limitless
174,o_s_k_r,the plot holes are bigger than the plot!,5,14 September 2013,"I actually thought this was a fun drug movie in a lot of ways. The zooming camera work was amazing and the acting was pretty good too. However it must be noted that the plot is utterly incomprehensible!!! I don't think the director or screenwriter or anyone else could explain it if they tried. I'm wondering whether the plot was made like this on purpose in order to make it feel trippy. So to make the audience feel that they themselves are going crazy on drugs!OK, so here's just a few of the enormous gaping holes: 1. Cops grab a suspicious guy at a murder scene and don't pat him down or search him. wtf?! 2. Protagonist borrows $100 000 despite the fact he can make this much in two days. He then forgets to pay the loan back despite being super smart. wtf?!. 3. Girl gets inexplicably murdered while protagonist inexplicably blanks out. Does this play any role in the story? Nope. Do we find out why? Nope. Or who? Nope. 4. Where did the smart pills come from? How come there isn't a bunch of super smart guys connected to the original lab?I could go on and on but the holes are so big it's hard to define them! It feels like the individual scenes were inserted they way they are because somebody thought they were good individual scenes. The scenes feature the same characters but they feel like they are from slightly different movies!The other thing that needs a mention is the seriously backwards moral message in this film. The guy gets super smart and what does he do? He amasses money and drugs and runs for president. He pays lawyers to cover up his involvement in various murders. When you think about it the movie telling us that ""being smart means being a scumbag"".",Limitless
175,Legendary_Badass,Limitless in intrigue and excitement at breakneck pacing,9,19 March 2011,"You're not supposed to judge a book by its cover, or at least that's what authors tell us. Well motion picture directors would want you to not judge their films by the trailers or posters. Limitless is one of the few recent films to deny the misconceptions from its efficient marketing.It's sold as Bradley Cooper gets smart drug fix from Robert De Niro then must defeat him through a series of cat and mouse games. In actuality Eddie Morra (Bradley Cooper) is a struggling writer/slob who acquires a drug called NZT-48, a pill that allows him to recall everything from the briefest of encounters. In minutes he is transformed from a guy no one could believe has a book deal to a man no one can do without. Doors open, too many doors really. Eddie's problem solving solutions end up fanning the flames of questions around him, and before long it seems that everyone in the city is after him. The intricate dynamics that weave this trail of lies is the best since Match Point (2005).Cooper's performance totally shocked me. He's able to go from panicked addict to conversationalist genius and back without losing the support of the audience. With no key player for Eddie to confide in or take along for the journey, the supporting performances are little more than plot points. Abbie Cornish and Robert De Niro don't have nearly as much range to showcase in this screenplay. However with a little change, Anna Friel's one scene could have been expanded into something with more drama and likely give Limitless the emotional impact needed for some to take it seriously. Enough cannot be said for how amazingly brisk and refreshing the production comes across. Nearly every scene has at least some artistic appeal. This is one of the more attractive films I've seen using the Red digital cameras and I have to give the colorist some praise for the warm palette used to show the influence of NZT-48. Thanks to the mind-altering plot, Limitless is one of the few movies where extravagant transitions make sense. Limitless is indicative of a minor subgenre that sprang up around the dawn of the current millennium; I call this the genre of self-discovery. Examples of these films include Fight Club and The Beach and more examples can be found in Asian cinema (where I also believe Limitless drew inspiration for art direction). The primary goal of these metaphysical pictures is to delve into what makes us tick. Limitless asks the viewer to exam what's holding each of us back from being the perfect versions of ourselves, and by stories end this viewer certainly felt inspired. I can see room to complain when it comes to the way Limitless approaches relationships. Remember, I'm seeing this as a specialty film about inner exploration and as such I'm allowing for some leeway in how director Neil Burger is able to keep the pace going while focusing almost exclusively on Eddie. Still, I would have appreciated one scene showing how his limitless knowledge afforded him relationship-handling tact. Limitless has such a breathtaking pace that you aren't going to find the time needed to nitpick. Some of the action at movie's end is resolved with little plausibility, but it's too much fun to attack. At least the title of Limitless offers some truth in advertising.",Limitless

First, drugs are okay to enhance your abilities as long as you get smart enough to be able to figure out how get along without them.Second, it's okay to hook up with strange women and then kill them as long as you're rich enough to get a lawyer to get you off the hook. Oh, and it really wasn't his fault, he was in withdrawal at that point. (Was I REALLY the only one who did NOT miss that he got away with murder?) Third, it's okay to get money from some Russian loan shark as long as you forget to repay him on time as long as you become his drug dealer and then kill him when he comes after you because he was a bad guy.Oh, and drugs are good for you, you can take them, write a bestseller and then get into politics and eventually get to be president of the U.S.A. if you take them.

185,iReviewFilms,Fanaticalaboutfilms Review: Limitless,7,22 March 2011,"15 - 105mins - Mystery/Thriller - 23rd March 2011Soon to be released on the 23rd of March, Limitless focuses around the life of writer Eddie Morra (Bradley Cooper) a man who is heading nowhere fast in life; he is most definitely in the slow lane. The book he's currently working on has reached healthy zero words after an extended spell of writers block and his love life is trending down a similar road.Cue a chance encounter with an old acquaintance and the discovery of a way to escape the mundane world that he is currently calling his life. The way you ask? Take a pill, a simple clear pill that will solve all his problems. It has the ability to open up access to all of his brain function rather than his current 20% and release the boundaries and confines that he was once restricted to. Realising that nothing can get much worse than it already is he uses it and things immediately become easy for him. The only slight issue being he does not have an endless supply and that unsurprisingly he is not the only one who knows of its existence.Whether meant to be ironic or not the first time you see Eddie you could be forgiven for thinking he was on drugs and as the movie progresses along with his life thanks to the help of the drug, NZT-48 he cleans up his act. Cooper does a good job of self narrating the well written script that gives us some funny moments and dry wit to boot whilst his ability to move between the two altering personalities while he is on and off the drug is impressive.De Niro and Cornish play their parts well but are not given enough screen time to develop their characters into noteworthy performances as most of the focus is kept on Eddie. This leads me into my only slight disappointment with the movie in that the secondary characters seem to get no mention, then appear for ten to fifteen minutes before disappearing never to be seen or referenced to again making the plot slightly disjointed to say the least.This is countered by the fact that I absolutely love the cinematography and the way that this movie has been constructed. The effect carried out at the opening credits as the camera continuously tunnel zooms through the urban nightlife sets the standard for the rest of the film. When on the drug everything is brighter, people are well groomed and then when off it everything is gloomier/darker so as to visualise the emotions and state of mood being felt in Eddie's mind. Not only that but you can feel the heightened effect the drug is having as more things are put on screen to engage the viewer and get you thinking while at the same time the camera flits about the place as the tempo is increased to indicate Eddie's enhanced brain activity.SPOILER Don't read on if you don't want to find out about some of the plot! The movie ties up most lose ends but nothing is ever really made of the death/murder of the girl in the hotel room drawing back to my point of token extra characters. This could be meant to be sinister especially with the lawyer stating that someone had the decency to wipe the place of prints. Also the ever increasing desperation and the willingness to do anything for that next hit (drinking the blood off the floor) could have been played on a bit more to show the true darkness of how drugs can effect us.All in all Limitless was a very enjoyable film that kept me entertained for its duration. The drug effects on the world around Eddie were cleverly depicted as was most on the CGI letting you feel the drug with him and although I felt they could have pushed the boundaries slightly further and explored the drugs side of things a bit more I was glad to have watched this fun flick.For further reviews feel free to check out: http://www.fanaticalaboutfilms.com",Limitless

187,oragex,The scriptwriter forgot it's own pill - could have been a good movie otherwise,7,19 June 2017,"A 7/10 just because the idea behind the scenario is great but someone wrecked the scenario in the process.TONS of spoilers, be aware.The film starts rather acceptable with a 'plausible' plot in the beginning, and for the first 1/3 it's quite well put together. But then it starts incorporating elements - such as the Russian guys, or the erratic love story in distress, or even worst, the illogical death of the modeling girl. The illogical evens just keep going with Eddie not being investigated for the death of Vernon when he was just in the room with the dead body. He makes $12k in a week which logarithmically speaking would have brought him close to $100k in a month and beyond millions in a year so no need to get in trouble with shady people for a 'loan'. More, as mentioned by other reviews, the Russian mafia guy doesn't get his money back, even when Eddie just made 2 million in ten days or so.Then, the more the movie approaches the end, the more they want us to believe many/most/all successful people must also be on this pill. This trashes the movie even more because the movie stands up and it's credible on the initial basis that Eddie was among very few people who had access to the pill. Like we need to trust the story, or if actually many people were on the pill, how comes Eddie was so quickly successful and that was a surprise for everybody? Finally, the way he puts Van Loon at his place is pathetic after during the whole story Van Loon was about the most powerful and fierce businessmen in the room. And then, just to put the cherry on the sundae, we learn that he can actually even see the future.The story plot could have been just as simple as Eddie making a pile of cash out of stock market, then he would have went back to his ex and blind her with all the dough and stuff, go out with her at a nice restaurant and end of the story, everybody's happy - including myself.

It's intriguing to know what's the side effects of it. Well, it's quite fun to know what's going to happened to the protagonist but the movie's smartness isn't very limitless. There are massive plot holes in here. There are also some confusion in this.If there is something limitless in here then it's the entertainment quality. Neil Burger gave a lot of style and ridiculousness in this film. The editing was quite fast and fun. The zooming in through places is amazing. The soundtrack and the music score does perfectly fit in every scene. The performances were good. Bradley Cooper is an entertaining actor but he had some weaknesses in serious scenes like crying or being scared. Robert De Niro only shows up in times but you know him, he is just being himself and there is nothing wrong with that.Overall the movie is ridiculously fun. The movie is no cliché, it's all unique by so many reasons including the trippy, vertigo, and zooming in style. It's intriguing, it's fast, and it's smart at times. ""Limitless"" is another movie that has merits that ignore the flaws. It's just a non-stop entertaining solid flick.",Limitless
191,burnzyburns,"Great concept, safe execution",8,24 February 2021,"With a such an interesting concept, Limitless had potential to run away as an all star movie, but instead it falls a little bit flat and it is safe and easy to watch. It ends up being more of a summer blockbuster or a Michael Bay-esque style movie rather then something extremely thought provoking. By no means is this a bad thing but you'll be disappointed if you wanted more of a backstory on the drug. Everything in this movie happens quickly and nearly all at once and there isn't time for questions to be answered. I also think the movie gets to be full of itself and suffers from the awareness syndrome. Overall Limitless is a good movie, it's more of your typical cliche action/thriller then anything else but with good acting and a surprisingly good ending, it's still very much enjoyable.",Limitless
192,redeyedtree,7 is generous,7,18 August 2012,"Limitless was 'messy' (in a good way) right from the start and then they ended it all cut and polish. The alternate ending on the DVD was much better. If they had combined the two, I would have given Limitless at least a 9. As it is, 7 is generous. I am always mesmerized by Bradley Cooper's blue eyes and Robert De Niro is one of the grand masters of acting. The idea of mind enhancers is old but Limitless presents it in a fresh way. I liked the opposite reaction to the drug - Eddie vs. Lindy. By-the-way, I am new to Abbie Cornish and hope she has a long and fruitful career. He tasted the power and wanted more with little or no reservation; she tasted it and liked it but saw the inherent danger. Of all the locations I liked his old apartment the best. It had so much character and set the basis for the contrast between pre-NZT Eddie and post-NZT Eddie (of course, clothing and hair helped). What were they thinking with that ending - there was no struggle, no questions. He was like the addict that finally got all the perks without the consequences. It just didn't fit!!!",Limitless

Nor are the characters particularly well developed. But I was engaged from beginning to end with this taut and, best of all, original thriller. I've never seen anything quite like it. It proceeds in a generally credible and suspenseful way from its premise--a pill that allows you to use all of your brain.Of course, the notion that we're only using a small fraction of our brains is untrue, but I liked how the film uses this urban fib as a springboard for its engaging story.There are one or two moments that strain credulity, (I'm thinking, particularly, of the one-eyed thug who can't seem to hit the broad side of a barn with his gun) but I think every good story has a few of those.The camera tricks and visual effects used to externalize what's going on in the main character's head are also a lot of fun. Good performances by all the actors.If you yearn for science fiction movies and thrillers that you can actually believe from moment to moment and haven't seen 10 times before, then I'd recommend this one.",Limitless
200,DemiRonin,"Limitless' structure may be a bit atypical, but its journey is extremely entertaining.",9,17 April 2011,"Limitless' structure may be a bit atypical, but its journey is extremely entertaining. Bradley Cooper plays Eddie, a broke and struggling writer who spends his days staring at a computer screen without accomplishing a single written word. After being dumped by the love of his life Lindy, played by Abby Cornish for basically being a loser, Eddie runs into his Ex-Brother in law Vernon dressed in some very expensive looking designer clothes.The two decide to catch up at a bar where Vernon, feeling sorry for Eddie decides to give him a hit of the newest drug he's been peddling, NZT. NZT is apparently a drug soon to be released on the market that lets your brain work at a super human level. On NZT your deductive faculties surpass that of Sherlock Holmes and your amped learning curve allows you to learn a language simply by listening. With nothing to lose Eddie pops the pill and in one day he is able to seduce his land lord's wife and brilliantly finish a draft to his book. After experiencing life on NZT Eddie immediately comes begging for more but before he can reach some sort of deal with Vernon Eddie finds that Vernon has been put outta the picture.Searching Vernon's apartment he finds a stash of NZT and within days transforms himself into the smartest and most charismatic man on the planet. With these new powers Eddie decides he can the change entire world but needs money in order to do it. So he takes a loan with an very unscrupulous Russian loan shark and starts playing the stock market. Eddie does so well on the market that he entices the eyes one of the most powerful business men in the world, Carl Van Loon, played by Robert De Niro. The rest of the movie is a thrilling adventure with numerous character all trying extract something from Cooper, whether it's his skills on the market or his access to NZT. Cooper also has to deal with some of the territory that comes with a drug habit, including dependency and side effects. Limitless uses some very nice special effects to show the effects of NZT by playing with lens and color. When he's not on NZT the film is sucked of its color and the world becomes noticeably dimmer than the golden fast tracked life of ""NZT Eddie"". The sound design is also splendidly done as while on NZT the film focuses on singular sounds like the rotating of a bicycle wheel. The plot moves extremely fast with new characters and problems appearing one after another. This breakneck speed is fun to watch, but on the other hand, if you don't keep up you're going to be asking your friends how does ""that"" connects to ""this"". The film doesn't coddle you with character dialogue blatantly explaining every connection. Nor does it give you much room to breathe and connect every single dot, most people will have to do that after the film is finished. I watched the film twice by happenstance and thoroughly enjoyed Limitless just as much if not more the 2nd go around.Bradley Cooper is a up and coming super star and in this film you not only see that he has range but that your eyes are glued to his every move. Andrew Howard plays a really good Russian bad guy and was quiet fun to watch, even if his role leans a little stereotypical. Abbie Cornish was also fairly good. De Niro played a very good upscale businessman but I felt was under utilized. Carl Van Loon is supposed to be an intimidating veteran of the game whose experience puts him at a level capable of threatening Eddie, but he never really lives up to that role. *Filmmakers Note - When introducing a character such as De Niro that is supposed to be ""the man who owns half on New York"" don't have the first shot we see of him be a wide shot of him walking up stairs. Filmmaking 101, use low angles to give characters power, use high angless to lower power. All in all this film is a blast. Every person who's ever felt lazy and wanted to be a better version of himself - motivated, charismatic, and intelligent will love this movie. For people who've gotten there the hard way, their mindset might take issue with this film. Who this film is not for: -Neuroscientists who cringe at the saying ""we only use 10% of our brains"" who also can't get beyond the sci-finess and exaggeration of the premise (it can get a little ridiculous) -Extremely moralistic people who believe there are no short cuts in this world and that if you take drugs you don't deserve anything.",Limitless
201,Innsmouth_Apprentice,"Concept is fantastic, but execution is flawed.",7,29 October 2014,"Limitless tells the story of a disorganized, poor, wannabe-writer loser Bradley Cooper who stumbles upon a drug that makes him super-smart. Suddenly, he can brilliantly achieve any task with lightning speed.The movie is based on a book, and the entire idea is excellent. You should see Limitless if only for the cool ways it promotes being focused on increasing your mental abilities, and the perks that come with intelligence. Bradley Cooper does some stupendous acting in the main role, the visual and audio direction is awesome, with great special FX. The movie's first third or so is very good overall.However, after that the movie stumbles repeatedly. The movie's creators/book author prove unequal to the task of writing an uber-genius's thoughts and actions plausibly. Nor can they break out of the mold of action-movie templates and clichés. As a result, and in order to keep the story going, they put the protagonist into trouble that is completely incompatible with his intelligence - which is not only proclaimed, but explicitly shown via various effects of it. They try to write this guy as genius, but unfortunately, he is a genius only when it suits the plot. When the writers need to insert your standard action villain, or other obstacles - the hero's genius conveniently disappears.To sum up: definitely worth seeing for the concept alone, but by no means the masterpiece it could have been. 7/10.",Limitless

203,Marthian80,"An exciting mystery thriller, with a loser rising to fame & fortune using super drugs",8,14 November 2016,"Limitless is about a loser named Eddie Morra (Bradley Cooper) who's life is going nowhere. He is trying to write a book but doesn't get a word on paper after four weeks and when his girlfriend breaks up with him, he is really in the dumps. But then he runs into an old friend who likes him to try a new drug that grant's access to 100% of a persons brain. Eddie is very skeptic but decides to give it a shot because he has nothing to loose. The effect of the drug is immensely powerful: Eddie finishes his manuscript in one sitting, cleans his whole house and picks up a girl in the hallway because he knows exactly what to say. But when the drug wears off, he immediately is his old self again. So he decides to look up his old friend to get some more pills, but then the story takes a turn because he founds out that his old friend has just been murdered in his apartment. It seems Eddie is not the only one interested in the powerful drugs..The story of Limitless is told in a 'mysterious thriller' way that keeps you on the edge of your seat for the whole 105 minutes that it runs. It is told from the perspective of Eddie so in the beginning your as clueless as he is but more information is revealed as the movie moves on. There are some nice twists on the ride and the ending is very satisfying.The effects in the movie are also nicely done. When Eddie is high on the pills, the whole movie 'lights up' by using brighter colors so the whole world looks more beautiful. The way Eddie looses track of time and no longer feels in control is also greatly done and reminds me of Requiem for a Dream.The cast also did a great job. Bradley Cooper is excellent as well as the supporting characters Robert De Niro (as the wealthy businessman Carl van Loon), Abbie Cornish (Eddie's on-off again girlfriend) and Andrew Howard as the criminal who lends Eddie money.What I didn't like from the money is that some parts of the movie feel disconnected from each other. The transition form Eddie as the no-life writer to his rise to fame goes a little to fast for me. They also could have done more with the addictive nature of the drug and some parts of the story are not explored enough.That said it is an excellent mystery-thriller that keeps you excited with every twist and turn it takes.",Limitless

If you like dramas with a little kick-ass thrown in and a little escapist fantasy, this is a great film. I should probably develop my own scale for date movies and rate them accordingly. That in mind, it's not a chick-flick, but also not a pure testosterone film, though it leans more toward the guy side. De Niro's presence automatically adds at least 4 points to any film review, though you can scale that down a bit for ""Limitless"" due to his relatively short screen time.

207,paperback_wizard,It opens your mind,7,19 March 2011,"Someone asked me once what I thought ADD medication does. I thought  about it for a second, and replied, ""In the simplest terms, it changes  your mind."" Sometimes, people's minds need changing. More than just a  push or a boost, sometimes people need help remembering things,  learning new things, making connections between things they already  know, motivating themselves to use that information, etc.  In the movie ""Limitless"", there's a pill that does all of that; and  much, much, much more.  The tagline for this movie is ""What if a pill could make you rich and  powerful?"" I prefer a line from the trailer: ""How many of us ever know  what it is to become the perfect version of ourselves?"" Bradley Cooper  plays Eddie Morra, a writer who can't motivate himself to write his  book even when he locks himself in a room with his laptop. He doesn't  do drugs (anymore), but anyone who looked at him would swear he was  always strung out. He doesn't have anything.  One day, Vernon (played by Johnny Whitworth), his ex-brother-in-law who  is also his ex-dealer, offers him some help: a clear, little round pill  that will clear his mind. Within a minute of taking it, Eddie finds he  can remember tiny things from years earlier, make connections between  little bits of information that he'd never given so much as a second  thought, reason with startling eloquence, and most importantly (to  him), slam out ninety pages of his book in one sitting that make his  publisher beg for more. Does he want more pills after all this?  Absolutely.  He's not the only one who wants them, though. Despite Vernon's initial  claim that the pill is ""FDA-approved"", it's clear soon enough that this  is nothing you'll ever find in a drugstore. Whoever Vernon got it from  (and however he got it), Eddie'll likely never know, because Vernon is  murdered shortly after he and Eddie reconnect. Eddie finds Vernon's  stash of clear little pills and proceeds to make over his life. He'll  need every ounce of intelligence the pills can give him, too, to fend  off a ruthless loan shark, the police officer who wants to know Eddie's  connection to the dead dealer, and whatever shadowy figure is following  him from the moment he starts taking the pills.  In the meantime, Eddie realizes he can do far more than write books  with his newfound intellect. In a few short days, he makes millions on  the stock market, bringing him to the attention of Carl Van Loon, one  of the wealthiest, most powerful men in the world, played by Robert De  Niro. Carl is more than happy to benefit from Eddie's ""freak"" status,  and even cautions Eddie not to push himself too far. Eddie has the  brains, but Carl clearly has the experience (and the resources). He  warns Eddie to not try and become his competitor (read: enemy).  Finally, Eddie has to deal with the drug's side effects. He has waking  blackouts, often finding himself across town, in strange locations,  with complete strangers and no memory of how he got there. Withdrawal  symptoms are worse than your standard medication, obviously, and  stopping could mean hospitalization or worse. Since he doesn't know who  makes the pills or where to get more, this is his biggest problem.  Or would it be worse to stay on the pills? Eddie claims they're just  making him into a better version of himself, but are they, in fact,  changing who he is? Do they not just change what you can do, but also  what you will do? His girlfriend, played by Abbie Cornish, once had to  deal with a man who wouldn't do anything; now, she has to deal with a  man for whom there's nothing he wouldn't do. The end of the movie  leaves the question of just how much the pills change you unanswered.  Based on a novel written by Alan Glynn, this movie has plenty of action  sequences to complement the moral dilemma it poses: how far will you go  to become a ""better"" version of yourself? Like all the great science  fiction movies, this thriller doesn't focus on the sci-fi aspects,  choosing instead to highlight the exploration of humanity on which we  embark with the very first scene. And anyone who contemplates  medication to improve their lives will certainly find a resonance with  the character of Eddie Morra. Watching this movie may not change your  mind, but it will certainly open it.",Limitless

It is a very pacey movie but the good things you get to ride along, so many things so good in this movie i can't believe i didn't watch this movie long time ago.Bradley Cooper, one word for his acting, WOW. So from the trailer you know, the movie basically spins around him, so no surprises there. He has done a exceptional job in this. From the premise you see him standing at the edge of terrace and looking like a weirdo on the street his characterisation was just perfect. If not for anything you can watch this movie just for him.The other characters in the movie, they come and disappear just like lightning. That's not just a metaphor for sudden appearance, they are so powerful as well. The first guy who introduces the pill, perfect. Robert De Niro, i don't think this guy even knew they were filming it, he was just being himself and so awesome in what he does. The money lending asshole, very cool. Every character is given a thoughtful screen space and they mark their stand in that scene and no traces of them after that.Now that is a positive for the character, but slight negative for the movie. At times i began to wonder should it have to Robert De Niro, would it make a difference if someone else was in that scene? Probably not, he was good, but again in the bigger scheme of things he was just being a douche bag in trying to make Bradley his bitch, so anyone with a grumpy attitude as that could have played and i still would have watched it.I don't want to be nitpick, but for the Bradley cooper the guy he is shown, i just couldn't accept he knows everything from all over. Yes, some facts were OK, but striking a conversation with every human being possible, i just cannot agree. In the beginning you get the weird camera angle which was disturbing enough, but when they bring it again, i felt a bit like getting sucked in and irritated me. Maybe the director wanted a first person camera angle, but that was not a selling point and could have avoided. Also the movie just ended, i mean literally it was just the director had a call from his home and decided to end the movie. It just snapped and the movie closed. For a movie that was being so realistic and detailed as it is, a clichéd ending was not acceptable at all. I was really disappointed and the explanations given by Cooper on the sidewalk was total bullshit. The movie should have ended with Cooper stranded on the terrace and making the audience guess what could have he done, now that would have been awesome. In the end movie actually advocates taking pills to enhance your memory which is not a good message for kids. I know kids are not dumb enough to follow a movie's advice, but still a responsible media platform such a movie shouldn't promote such a messageNevertheless, i was throughly enjoyed towards the entire movie sans the ending and i would believe everyone would have a good time as well.",Limitless
211,Schnayblay,"""Limitless"" Has It's Limits, But Not Many",8,12 December 2011,"This film really caught my attention. ""Limitless"" is the story of Eddie, a writer who is lazy, just got dumped by his girlfriend, and almost broke. When his ex-wife's brother see's him, he decides to use Eddie as a guinea pig for a new drug called NZT, which enhances brain capacity to 100%. Instantly addicted, Eddie gains a whole new life perspective and goes on a self-improvement spree, if you will.Due to his new brain power, he can memorize everything and for what he wants to do, he needs serious money, so he starts by analyzing the stock market and becomes the biggest expert broker in New York. But after a while in the limelight, he has no more NZT, so he starts doing desperate things to get some. He makes enemies with a Russian loan shark who steals a pill of NZT, not knowing what it is, and now forces Eddie to give him more.As Eddie goes through his new life, he gets his girlfriend back, but soon, negative effects from the NZT such as black outs wear him down. Now Eddie has to find a way to keep his new life together so he doesn't have to go back to being a bum.The film is more of a thriller than anything. Little action, a bit of humour, but it's like ""Doctor Who"" humour, with him being so smart he out-thinks everyone and makes them look like idiots.There are no effects what so ever. But there is some action. There's a part where the Russian's gang breaks into Eddies house looking for NZT. There's a shoot-out, and to see Eddie's mind racing is great fun.There's another fight scene that was kinda unnecessary but it's cool nonetheless. After a blackout caused by the NZT, Eddie's inside the subway, and he bumps into some gang member. The gang huddles around and goes to beat him up, but by remembering moves in Bruce Lee movies and instructional self defence video's, he learns how to fight in seconds. He beats the hell out of the gang members, but it doesn't look like he's a pro fighter. It looks like what it's supposed to be: he's copying. Analyze and Interpret.The end has to be addressed cause it's where the film falls. After one point, it pull's a Season 2 ""Battlestar Galactica"" finale and skips ahead a year. Now Eddie is running for the Mayor's office, his book is out, and he's happy as can be.Van Loon shows up and reveals he knew Eddie was taking NZT and threatens that Eddie's drug labs just got shut down, but Eddie's become so smart by this point, he knows they haven't been.Eddie reveals to having fine tuned the NZT formula, and knows that Van Loon's company is in the toilet, so any threats are pointless. I was expecting some last action scene, but it's just verbal confrontation. Van Loon drives away after being totally burned, and Eddie goes to meet his girlfriend for lunch. They sit down at a restaurant, he speaks a foreign language to an Asian waiter, and then just says ""What?"" to his girlfriend after she stares at him. And then the movie just ends. Like seriously? That's it? No final shoot-out? Nothing? Just ""What""? It's such a bad ending that it leaves you feeling unsatisfied.The film is good. Mind you, it has flaws, but to see this bum writer go from Hobo to God is a highly interesting concept. Everything he does have consequences, and hearing his voice-overs, hearing his thoughts and how he deals with all this, is the most interesting part, I believe. Make a sequel to this. I wanna see more stuff you can do with this magic brain pill.Anyway, I recommend this to anyone who likes interesting plots and mind-bends. If you're looking for an action movie, it'll satisfy you a little, but not as much as if you watched, say ""Rambo"". Good film, terrible ending.",Limitless
212,TyJustice,A fun cinematic experience,7,4 February 2018,"Alright, so the movie bases it's ""Limitless pill"" device on the age old myth that we only use 10% of our brain. If you're willing to look past that aspect of the movie, I think there's a lot of fun to be had here. Bradley Cooper plays Eddie, a writer who by the beginning of the movie has fallen into a depression, his apartment is a mess, he struggling to pay his bills, and his future is looking bleak. That's when we're introduced to the mysterious, fascinating character from Eddie's past who personally gives him the pill that changes Eddie's life.Abbie Cornish, playing opposite Bradley Cooper as Lindy, does an outstanding job throughout the many serious, tense scenes the movie places her in. She plays a fascinating character motivation for Eddie and has a well rounded, interesting character development.Robert De Niro also has a major role in this film as Carl Van Loon, a New York City bigshot with more power than he knows what to do with. While the majority of the movie is fun, gripping and all plays very well into the general theme of the film it is not without it's moments that tend to feel like a drag, often in the second act. That complaint is outweighed by the rest of the film, and I would still certainly recommend this movie to anyone looking for a fun, mysterious thriller.",Limitless
213,schizoidnightmares,A fantasy for performance drug enthusiasts,5,18 April 2021,"If Eddie was only using 20% of his brain before he began using the fictitious ""superhuman"" drug NZT, he is using even less after taking it. The drug compels him to live a risky and should I say outright brainless lifestyle: committing adultery with his landlord's wife (it is no wonder we find out later Eddie has an ex-wife, in addition to his present failed relationship with a girlfriend) seeking a loan shark for ""financial services,"" forgetting to deal with said loan shark, going into the stock market as a day trader (which is essentially legalized gambling, with more plenty of smart losers for every smart winner) and betting ""his"" money on it for success, attracting a ton of attention in the process, wildly partying, and consuming other drugs on top of the experimental NZT... My guess if the movie were made in today's age, he'd be investing in crypto, since that is the latest financial gambling fad. Put simply, the drug turned a harmless nobody into a hyperactive pretentious yuppie.The film does get some points though: it moves at a brisk place, includes decent performances from its cast, and does make an effort to show some of the negative consequences of performance-enhancing drugs.Unfortunately, the ending leaves much to be desired, as Eddie is depicted to have suffered essentially no medical consequences - he is in fact shown retaining the positives of the drug, while having none of the negative side effects. The fictional NZT itself is some sort of miracle drug, almost as if it was concocted from the fantasies of real drug culture... The kind that, for example, claims drugs like cannabis can do everything from curing cancer, treating every mental illness under the sun, to ""enhancing"" one's intellect or creativity. While cannabis (marijuana) is an unfair comparison as it is not a performance-enhancing drug and doesn't tend to kill its users (being less dangerous than the likes of alcohol), I think you get the point.FYI, odds are you already use 100% of your brain. The only 10% or 20% claim of brain use made in the film is fictitious. You are stuck with the brain you got, so treat yours well and don't take drugs.",Limitless

Eddie Morra is one step from the gutter when he bumps into his ex brother in law who offers him this wonder pill, at first Eddie has doubts about what the drug can do?, He overcomes his initial nerves and takes the pill, everything changes from this point on.Eddie fast tracks the book he has delayed for over two years, he then sets his sights on bigger things and this sets in motion the main plot for the film... Lets back track a little here and look at some of the sub plots, one sub plot is the side effects this drug has and the double life Eddie leads, there is a darker side that rears it's head when Eddie drinks and indulges the excessive lifestyle that comes with the high rollers and there are definitely skeletons in the closet. Others sub plots include Russians and sinister characters whom all have an agenda to get hold of these wonder pills, some of these sub plots hold up better than others.The film is definitely worth a watch, obviously you have to suspend belief to some of the obvious plot holes, also turn a blind eye to the fact the brilliance bestowed on the person taking the pill makes them become blinded to the obvious supply issues.

I thought I was going to really enjoy it as it got started and we see the effects of this wonder drug. But then the wheels fell off. This guy has discovered that he can write bestseller books in a few days. He finds that he can double his money on the stock market in a matter of hours. So, what does he do? Well of course he gets into debt with the Russian mafia. What? Why the f would he do that? Ever hear of the chessboard and the grains of wheat trick? You put one the first square, then double that on the second , and again on the third. You can't get to the last square, because there isn't that much wheat in the world. Exponential growth soon leads to astronomical numbers. This guy just needs to keep doing what he is doing for a couple of weeks and he will be the richest man on Earth. In his meeting with the bigshot financier, his friend says that he has turned 12 thousand dollars into 1.2 million in ten days. OK Well if he does that for another 20 days he will have 83 trillion dollars. Why is he going cap in hand to some wall st. guy? Lastly - there is no doubt that super intelligence would have many advantages, but being a lethal street fighter would not be one of them. Fighting is about millisecond reflexes and trained reactions that have nothing to do with conscious thought. His wonder drug would not give him such abilities. So.

This time the booster is a drug. Something like that already exists, only they don't have the same effect as NZT Eddie takes in the movie, and they're called Nootropic drugs, usually used in Alzheimer treatment and other degenerative diseases.The main character, its well presented right in the first 10 minutes, and makes you be caught by his history of live mistakes and frustration. He's f****d up, and couldn't be different.Limitless has a clear photography. The viewer never gets those black scenes where it's impossible to know whats happening. A pretty good visual art.In general, acting is good, not memorable, nor poor, stays in the between. But Bradley impresses.The best about Limitless is the plot, it takes you by surprise at 90% of the time. What is really an impressive characteristic, since 90% of the movies from 2011 suck at this point, really suck, and I've watched lots of them.Of course, you can't stop thinking about Phenomenon (1996) when watching Limitless (if you've had watched phenomenon), but actually, the similarities are only the ""1000 QI points"", because intelligence here is treated in a different way. It's more about ""what will I do now to get more money?"" and not like ""oh, I'm super smart, now I can't stand a relationship"". Eddie is, actually, even more brilliant!Limitless is really one of the most exciting 2011 movies I've watched. It's dynamic, and didn't let me down any of his acts. Fun!",Limitless

In this case, the whole story is based on the life changing miracle drug NZT. The lottery jackpot effect. So weak! In some other movies, you can substitute NZT with radioactive spider bite or an alien light coming from the sky (Phenomenon).I can see why (young) people looking for a shortcut in life will like the NZT concept. Maybe you like super hero movies too. Such people are blinded by one aspect of a film and completely forget to rate the others. Did you give it 7 or more? This movie is not special. In a few words, it's about drug addiction, excess, thugs and resulting problems. If it's supposed to reflect the Wall Street types, then well done!

But his performances in those films were memorable, too! He has a special quality that allows him to make fun of himself even as he is delivering believable performances.

221,cinemabon,One pill makes you smaller...,9,17 November 2011,"Limitless Limitless - directed by Neil BurgerIf you could take a pill that would make you smart no, let's change that premise. If you could take a pill that would increase your intelligence – a distinct difference – would you take it? Of course, you would. Who wouldn't? That is the ultimate temptation to the ignorant world. We look around and see ignorance and complacency all around us. Consider ignorance as you would a plague. Mankind has suffered under its yoke since its inception, when we stood upright and some of us chose to build things rather than swing in trees – only now, you know the tree thing is silly in comparison. The pill makes it possible to possess the highest form of intelligence without any kind of hindrance. Remove all obstacles to reason, and you've created the ultimate moment in gathering disparate facts, putting them together, and making intelligence a tool for advanced development. You would be vastly superior to nearly everyone else around you. This is the premise of ""Limitless"" and the goal of scientists for many generations.To say we use twenty percent of our brain is a misnomer. We use all of our brain constantly – to walk, to eat, to breathe, to see, to hear, and memorize most of what we experience. Much of that experience is not stored for recall later only packets of what we read, what we see, what we hear is actually stored for our use. We compartmentalize our experiences. However, we use only twenty percent of what we know at any one time to make informed decisions based on our memory. What if you could take information you learned, say, thirty years ago, or seven years ago, or even three months ago, and apply it to a present situation. That would involve more of your brain's capacity to reason. Some people can use more than twenty percent to make informed decisions. But no human uses one hundred percent of their mind's capacity all of the time.In ""Limitless,"" washed up ""science-fiction writer,"" (why do they have to be washed up science fiction writers, damn it!) Eddie Morra, encounters an old friend, an acquaintance really, who gives him a sample of an experimental drug (AZT, NZT, something like that its name is not important). He also happens to be Eddie's ex-brother-in-law from a failed marriage. He sees how Eddie is down on his luck and could use a hand only he fails to tell Eddie everything about the drug he offers Eddie, only that it will transform his life.What does Eddie have to lose? His girlfriend left him. His publisher cuts him off. He's about to be evicted. So, he takes the drug. In a wonderful bit of make-up and lighting special effects, Eddie changes. His skin takes on a certain healthy glow. His blue eyes now sparkle. His facial affect has that tone of wisdom about it (kudos to actor Bradley Cooper for making the facial transition so convincing. Without his ability to perform this interior transformation, the film would lose its credibility). Eddie goes home and rattles off forty pages to the book he had hardly touched. The next day, the publisher is beating down his door for more. Eddie is thrilled with the prospect he could become successful. Yet, Eddie makes a horrible discovery, one that drives him back to his brother-in-law's apartment – the drug has an addictive quality to it. The down side, in a nutshell – stop using it and it will kill you! Driven to near madness, Eddie realizes he needs to keep going. He agrees to do what is necessary for his brother-in-law and goes to run his errands. When he returns, he finds the apartment turned upside-down and his brother-in-law assassinated. What he also realizes is that, in the middle of this intrigue, the burglars failed to find what Eddie also wanted, the drug. He finds the ""stash,"" avoids the pursuant police investigation, and begins a meteoric rise in society.""Limitless"" is a wild roller-coaster ride, a movie on caffeine; no car chases, explosions, or emphasis on CGI. It's just good plain storytelling. Without a good director at the helm, Brad Cooper may have overplayed his hand. However, thanks to director Neil Burger (The Illusionist), character Eddie Morra has all the subtly needed to pull off the weighty role convincingly. We believe Eddie's transformations, which continue throughout the film, from street bum, to smart savvy jet-setter, to intellectual, to driven drug addict and beyond. Had this film come out in December, I would suggest Cooper's portrayal as Oscar-worthy. It is that good. He has help along the way with a great supporting cast, that includes Robert DeNiro as a corporate fat cat bad guy and a pretty but gullible girlfriend in Abbie Cornish as Lindy. However, most of the film is dependent on Brad Cooper. He is in every scene and dominates every shot. This is his film to sell or lose. He comes off with panache.The opening ""credits"" shot is one of the most unique in cinema history. It appears as one continuous zoom shot (used again later to suggest the passage of time), which takes us from one end of New York's Manhattan to its opposite end in a matter of seconds. The unique blend of forward movement, kept in focus, while adding continuous motion has never been put on the screen in this way. I applaud both the camera work of Belgium DP Jo Willems, along with Editors Tracy Adams and Naomi Geraghty, whose camera work and seamless cuts place the audience right in the middle of the action. Veteran makeup artist Janeen Schreyer also gets mention for the expert job of helping to transform Cooper through his constantly changing personality.""Limitless"" is unpredictable, exciting, compelling, and thrilling.

226,barrwell,what if you found a drug that allowed you to use 100% of your brain?,9,16 October 2013,"It seems there are fewer watchable movies made every year, and the good ones usually don't get much hype. I had to stumble over 'Limitless' on the internet and didn't know it existed until a few months ago. The premise instantly intrigued me, but I was leery of a serious film starring Bradley Cooper, someone I had only seen in a few comedies (Wedding crashers, The hangover). It only took a couple minutes of watching to realize he was going to be fine, in fact he was very good in the role that required him switching from 'on' to 'off' the drug. Limitless is an exhilarating thrill ride of a movie that has everything the modern (or classic)movie viewer could want; a fascinating premise, outstanding visuals and cinematography, solid acting and plenty of action. This is great entertainment, and though you might not want to think too much about the plot, it doesn't matter because you won't have time anyway because it moves too fast.Eddie Morra (Cooper) is burned-out writer, a slob and a loser, who just got dumped by his girl when he runs into an old acquaintance who claims to be working in the pharmaceutical industry (though he is a former drug dealer) and has an experimental drug that Eddie ends up sampling. Eddie finds that while on the drug he can remember everything he has ever seen or read and immediately he start finding ways to profit from it as it seems he not only has amazing abilities of recall, he also has super-human energy. His whole personality is transformed and he begins making powerful new friends and uses his skill for huge gains on the financial markets to the point it draws the attention of market kingpin Carl Van Loon (Robert DeNiro)and soon Eddie is Van Loon's secret weapon in a massive upcoming merger...but things start getting twisted.Director Neil Burger does a tremendous job with all the interconnected story threads, and there are many: Eddie has only a limited amount of the drug and keeping himself 'on' is paramount, there are side-effects that may be fatal, there are other people using the drug and they will literally kill to supply themselves, the drug can cause blackouts and Eddie may have committed heinous crimes he doesn't remember, Eddie's new personality draws his old girlfriend back to him and she too ends up caught up in this web. Through all this Eddie also has too produce results for Van Loon and keep himself supplied with the drug.The rest you have to watch for yourself as there is so much going on in this film and it absolutely flies by, as I said, don't think about it too much -it's just a movie, and the ending seems a little tacked-on, but you can supply the deeper meaning and morals yourself, but give it a try...I don't recommend many contemporary films, but 'Limitless' is so absorbing and wildly entertaining I feel I can't hardly miss by saying CATCH THIS ONE! -and like me maybe your only problem will be how this gem slipped through the cracks with so little publicity...while films like 'Django Unchained' receive unwarranted Oscar attention, all 'Limitless' does is entertain!",Limitless

But not so bright, for a super-genius.",7,26 February 2019,"A cool plot hook sets up the story, and Bradley Cooper gets the job done both as a burned out writer and as a pill-enhanced super genius. The action is delivered consistently and tension maintained throughout. The cinematography is top-notch, and effective supporting roles are provided by Abbie Cornish and Robert DeNiro.However, viewers may find their capacity for suspending disbelief strained at times, when it comes to the protagonist's decision-making while on the genius pill.

And after earning extra millions on that gig, how is it that genius Eddie would forget about the money owed to loanshark guy? And beyond all that, why is it that genius Eddie finally aspires to the crapshoot that is American politics?

228,Bill-276,Definitely better than the tag-line,8,7 April 2011,"I think a lot of the reviews here (both good and bad) have this film pretty well depicted. I had a lot of problems with the shortcuts the plot takes and the fact that the film seemed more interested in being a thriller full of thriller clichés, than a thought-provoking film about mind expansion (see PhantomAgony's post on all the plot problems). But despite not reaching it's full potential to be a smarter film, the flaws in the storyline (and the contrived sub-plot), ""Limitless"" still held my attention very well. I would actually put this movie in with films like ""Groundhog Day"" and ""Phenomenom"" which are in the better-than-they-had-any-right-to-be category.The aspect of the film I want to focus on though in this review is the ending, and the reason is pretty simple: Most movies about medicine or science tend to show the negative aspects of the science they are depicting and it's writer/producer implied affect(s) on humanity (take your pick of any science fiction film - ""Moon"", ""Blade Runner"", ""Brave New World""... The theme is always ""Here's a new concept imagined by scientists that could happen or apply very soon, and here's why it's bad for humanity""). And for the majority of ""Limitless"", this broken record seems as if it's going to skip it's way to the same conclusion. But it doesn't. Instead, at the end of the film, we see the character of Eddy trying to use his newfound powers for the good of humanity (a la ""Phenomenom"" rather than the scientific stereotypes Mike Myers might mock in the Austin Powers series). And this turn, in my opinion, puts ""Limitless"" in the company of a very small group of ""positive existential"" films. Generally those two words put together would seem like an oxymoron, but they're not. And I was very glad to see the film turn the negativity it creates around the fictional drug, into somewhat of a dark but happy ending. This is a very rare feat in today's cinema. In fact, I can only think of a handful of films that leave this kind of impression (""Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind"", the soul-punching ""Ponette"", and arguably ""Good Will Hunting"" and ""Contact"").Now overall, I wouldn't put this film in a league with those first three films, but that message of ""positive scientific potential"" as opposed to ""apocalyptic doom because of science"" was a breath of fresh air to me. I would love to see more stories like this take hold in our collective imaginations over the predictable negative sci-fi thrillers that are churned out in a limitless supply by Hollywood.I have to admit, I was expecting a purely predictably bland thriller copy--and there's some of that. But I was more than pleasantly surprised by the movie overall.

It really grabs your attention and holds it the entire time. This movie has a little bit of everything...action, romance, suspense, humor. Cooper did a great job in his role.The main idea of the movie shows how people who don't usually experience much success in life, react once things start changing for them. Achieving more and more success becomes an endless cycle. You start to get bored with all that you have and you crave more, until soon enough you crash.

232,dokha,Highly compressed movie,6,30 June 2011,"i recently watched source code, limitless, and unknown which i will make a review for each of them. all these movies have something in common i feel the directors try to rush they don't take enough time to explain the complicated concepts and events in which is crucial to understand the movies, they also do not shed enough light on key role characters, in addition the dialog is often vague in which the viewer is not clear on whats happening, in a nutshell the storytelling in all three movies is plain CRAPPY (Unknown not so much), i cant help but feel that most directors are attempting to imitate Christopher Nolan style which i despise (making fairly complicating ideas into hugely complicated through his very bad direction and storytelling and even dialog. in limitless and source code specifically very little information is provided keeping the viewer thinking in order to fill the illogical gaping holes in the technicality of the story and the complicated events revolving around the main character leaving the viewer thinking logically of what or why just happened instead of just enjoying the moment. and this what i don't recognize in older movies i don't feel the movie is an outline or a summary of another longer version, and i don't feel the compression of the development of incidences during the movie.---Limitless--- First half of the movie i enjoyed a lot the pace was perfect not too fast or too slow, but the the second half, many incidents just happened that just wasn't made clear or shed light upon enough, Why did the man in tan coat chase him after he realized he was calling him? this part is not explained, and like when Brandt the lawyer (how should i know he took the pills too) stole the pills from Atwood who was dying and when (after i replayed this part half a dozen times) the man in tan coat killed Brandt for stealing from his boss then Eddie took the pills. and when retrieved the pills from his girlfriend's place how the hell did he lose them again? these parts are compressed in a crazy way it makes u hate the movie, these are just a few of many, but the movie was a new idea and i enjoyed most of it although some parts make u yell ""oh common!"" like when Eddie dropped the last pill in the drain or when he couldn't even hide this one pill from the Russian guy, these parts are just stupid. the movie could have easily be 2 hrs but it seems Hollywood only makes movies that doesn't exceed 1:40. this seems to be a common trait which is very annoying.",Limitless

One day, he meets a drug dealer who sells him a top-secret drug which bestows him with super human abilities. And he is soon to find out that ""with the power comes great responsibility""This movie made a buzz in 2011 when it launched provocative and smart advertising campaign, which featured a guy hacking into the screens on the Time Square in New York. That was brilliant move, fresh and interesting, and it is probably the only thing which is good about this movie.It should have been called Brainless. Yes, to hope that this movie would be smart and brainpower-demanding would have been completely unreasonable. After all, from the first frames of the trailer you could guess that this is yet another pop-corn action about difficult life of people with superpowers. However, even these low expectations did not save me from brutal truth: you have to turn your brains off to watch this movie.The whole topic of the super-drug and super-powers is so over-used, that to come up with something new is virtually impossible – probably this is the reason why authors took the book ""The Dark Fields"" as their inspiration. I can only hope that the book is better than this boring, dull and silly movie. There is no intrigue; all the turns of the plots are easily foreseen. Authors try to include more characters, but this starts to look like a plaster on the gaping hole when you realise how underdeveloped and, again, brainless all the other characters are. The tricks with the camera are fun the first time you see them, but start to really annoy for the fourth-fifth time. The trick when the whole world gains colors when the characters take the pills is old as the movies about pills, but still nicely done and pleasure to watch. This, however, cannot be said about camera riding through the streets and tilting sideways from time to time.Most of the actors look like they don't understand what is going on in the movie. Abbie Cornish, who plays Lindy, looks lost all the time. It seems like actors saw the screenplay only on the film set, and were asked to improvise. I have to say though that Robert De Niro as Carl Van Loon is absolutely organic and convincing. He is not trying to impress us with his acting abilities, but he is just doing his job, calmly and impressively. It seems to me that this movie was designed for insecure people, non-achievers, humble dreamers who just want to see what the life could turn into when you get the super-pill and superpower to make your dreams come true. It is brainless popcorn movie like the third Transformers, but without Transformers and with drugs and sex.

Robert De Niro's presence adds some gravity to the production but there really isn't much for him to do with his character, so even he can't rescue this pretty looking failure from itself.

""It was pretty good, but I've seen a lot better."" Although I love the concept of a pill that allows gives the user access to their full brain capacity, it didn't have enough in it to give it some kind of legacy.It was much better than I thought it would be. Bradley Cooper is actually a charming and relatable lead. He truly is the lead, the rest of the cast (except for a delightfully evil dude played by Andrew Howard) had nothing to them. They served as plot devices to get the film from point A to B. Even Robert De Niro was just in it for the quick and easy paycheck. The reason none of the secondary characters were interesting was that, for one thing, it centers around Cooper's character (I can't complain about that), and also, because it just had too many characters. None of them were really annoying, they just really didn't do anything to make them more interesting. I have to say that I do respect the film's decision to kill off the only mildly irritating character quickly and efficiently.""Limitless"" tries to dip into every genre. I really respect anyone who attempts to do this. My favorite movie, ""Tremors"", uses comedy, action, horror, sci-fi, romance and western elements, and hits each genre with high success. Director Neil Burger (""The Illusionist"") tries to hit multiple genres and only has mild success with each. However, nothing seemed forced, which is good. The tense moments flow nicely with even the silliest moments. For example, a scene where a small child is used as a weapon (which is actually the most memorable and amusing part of the film).I give it a 7/10 for being an effective, smart and tense thriller. I respect it for mixing genres (even though I have seen much better). Overall it was well made, fuelled by good direction and a good performance by the lead. I liked how it romanticized the drug (on it: bright and colorful, off of it: grey and bleak). Good message for the kiddies. But it is counter-acted when it shows the negative effect of the drug. I liked the political correctness of it all.The final word: It kept my attention for the whole runtime. It had a few flaws, which made it mediocre. To be honest, I would be fine never seeing it again. It's an effective and entertaining movie, so you should see it, but only once. In a way, it is what every movie should be, something that you enjoy while it lasts, then you move on to the next movie. But if every movie was as efficient as that, there would be no such thing as ""classics"". That is this film's main flaw, nothing that could make it a ""classic"".

I didn't think a movie about a drug would interest me much, but there wasn't much else to see so I watched this. Lo and behold, I was pleasantly surprised, at least throughout MOST of it. I thought that Brad Cooper was perfectly cast, along with the entire cast in this thriller that managed to be original when I thought I'd seen it all. There were plenty of nail-biting moments at every turn. Lots of intrigue and unanswered questions that kept me wanting to know more. I'd have to watch it again to give it a fine-tooth-comb review, but there were a couple weaknesses that stood out. For one thing, I kept wondering why, after being stalked and chased by mysterious bad guys, no one ever thought to simply go to the police? It seems highly unlikely that a man wielding a knife chasing a woman through central Manhattan--even onto the ice skating rink at Rockefeller Center--would not arouse the authorities or bystanders or someone to intervene. It just didn't seem plausible. Then there was the high-security apartment that he bought for $8.5 million. He shelled out all that $ for all that protection, yet the bad guys were still somehow able to break in using power tools, without the police or a concierge ever having been called? (I know, Brad Cooper took out his cell phone at this point and got a ""no service"" message...but still, I couldn't help but think that a pad with so much alleged security wouldn't have had a panic button or safe-room. It just seems totally implausible and therefore a plot weakness).Nevermind that the powers obtained by taking the drug seemed Chuck-Bartowski-like. Even that I could have bought had the other plot weaknesses at least been tidied up. But they weren't.There was room to play around with and develop the relationship between Brad Cooper and De Niro, and the ending...honestly it sucked. It was like drinking a diet coke, it just tastes wrong and doesn't satisfy at all. This movie for me fell flat because of the lame unsatisfying ending. The strong points were the action, intrigue and performances, but those elements alone can't carry a picture whose story isn't fully fleshed out. I think they forgot to finish the script. Overall, this film had a lot of promise but in the end failed to deliver. I found it disappointing because of an under-developed plot and too many questions left unanswered.",Limitless

The idea behind Limitless is simple and in itself extremely intriguing. What if there was a pill you could take that would make you capable of anything without feeling any kind of negative emotions like stress or anxiety, would you take it without knowing the full consequences? Pretty cool idea right and one of those questions that could be debated over for hours and Limitless does a decent job with the overall premise but I felt it didn't quite go far enough into the morality and the humanity of taking such a pill and focused instead too much on the entertaining aspects such as paranoia, making tons of money, being witty and charming, etc.Bradley Cooper stars as Eddie Morra, a failure of a writer, recently dumped, and insanely depressed, who surprisingly runs into an old friend who gives him this special pill, NZT, that can access the remaining parts of your brain that lay dormant. This essentially is all you need to know (unfortunately the trailers pretty much tell you most of the film anyway) in order to understand what is going on. He starts to write, succeed with women, make millions, etc. all the while taking the pill, that is until some of his prior bad decisions as well as side effects of the pill start showing up.The direction, done by Neil Bruger (One of his past films is The Illusionist, if you haven't seen it I highly recommend it), is very well done, making Limitless one of the more visually, psychologically compelling films I've seen. He captures the feeling of the pill very well on screen and really excels as a director during a lot of the fast paced sequences. Leslie Dixon wrote the screenplay and deserves a lot of credit because it is mainly a dialogue driven film, however it is probably fair to assume that all of the credit goes to Alan Glynn who wrote the novel which this based on. However, where she faults is with the overall story itself. She at times seems like she can't figure out if she wants to write a film about the drug and what you can do with the drug, or the consequences of taking such a drug and the moral and human issues that come along with it. Dixon does succeed however with her dialogue, which is fast, witty, always entertaining, and who better to deliver than Bradley Cooper.Cooper is excellent as Eddie Morra and if there was any doubt that he could lead a film he's wiped it all away with this. He plays both sides of the character very well, the failure and the successful side and shows that he can not only do the comedy, fast talking, witty character that we all know he can do, but he can also pull off the dramatic side as well. As for DeNiro, he only shows up so that an older audience will go to see it. He plays a pretty important role, but not one that needs the acting chops of someone like Robert DeNiro (however maybe this is just more proof that he's slipping and is losing what he once was). Abbie Cornish also shows up as Eddie Morra's girlfriend throughout the movie, and is one of the character's I wish would have been present more on screen, mainly to help with what I thought was the only fault of the entire film.What Limitless lacks is the debate between what would people do if there was a drug that could help you accomplish your wildest dreams. The idea of a drug being able to do that is never really discussed nor is the idea of addiction, what it means for people around you, all the things that are usually brought up in a drug film. And what a better film to discuss these questions than with a story about a drug that makes you and your ideas, excuse the obvious use of the title but, limitless. What an awesome question of humanity, what if you could be perfect? How much time would you hesitate to try the pill, what would you do to get more, etc? Some of these questions are briefly touched upon and answered but not to the depth that they deserve. Instead the film aims to please the masses, with entertaining yet mentally boring action and dialogue. To make matters slightly worse, the ending doesn't help. Your left with a couple of pretty big questions and it leaves you hanging. However, I did like the ending and always will take a film that ends unconventionally and you wanting more than one that wraps everything up nicely and sends you on your way. It's one of those endings where as soon as the credits role your left discussing what you think happened, which in my book is a success. If you can get people talking about your film, and not just what scene they liked the best, or what song was in it, but a real conversation about the story, that is a huge accomplishment and one I hope to see more film makers try to do.",Limitless

What if there was a pill that could alter your entire universe, allow you to learn ANYTHING you wanted or be whatever you wanted to be? Adderall? Perhaps, but not to the level of this concoction. Neil Burger's Limitless (2011) tells the story of Eddie Morra (Bradley Cooper), a pathetic, dried out writer who acquires the newest pharmaceutical, NZT. This revolutionary drug allows him to recall anything he has ever learned and soak in as much new knowledge as possible. What could go wrong, right? Wrong! Once word gets around that Eddie has the untested drug, he must do anything he can to hide his stash, for if he stops taking the pill, serious side effects will occur. The movie definitely owns up to its potential as an entertaining thriller, although I would have really enjoyed seeing this concept with a more psychological tweak. This is a fun, fun movie to watch, especially for people who have actually taken drugs (not that I have, I'm just sayin'), but it's no Inception, folks. In fact, you might enjoy this movie more if you just sit back and turn off your brain for 105 minutes. Over-analyzing will just take the fun out of it. Sure, the writing is a bit illogical, but one can't exactly perfect a strong fact-based narrative for a product that doesn't actually exist. Where this movie really tries to excel is in its visual style. It's all, like, zing, zing, zing when we get a glimpse of Eddie's point of view! Quick-cuts, very trippy, but also a little bit tacky.

255,cuppa_tetleys,"So much potential wasted here, but so much fun it excuses it",7,3 April 2011,"Limitless is based by a book of the same name and any problems I have with the film are due to the translation of book to film. Primarily, it's clear that the book is written in the first person as their is an ongoing narration throughout the film of the main character commenting on events and giving exposition - which does the job in telling the story effectively, combined with the visuals (which are amazing), it does become irritating and at times unnecessary. My main problem with the film, however, is directly linked to why I liked it so much. Due to being based on a long book that would take hours and hours of reading, the story gets condensed and sped up, so plot points fly by one after the other and no time is wasted on anything useless which keeps it fast paced and engaging. However, this also means that problems and events that should have had more time get roughly 10 minutes to begin and conclude, downplaying their significance somewhat. Problems that seem dire get dealt with very quickly, seemingly with no side effects. The plot also lacks an overriding goal - a destination, it seems as if Eddie (Bradley Cooper) just takes things as they come rather than have an overall game plan, and it leaves you a bit dissatisfied in places as it feels it lacks direction, where in the book it would be more spread out and natural. OK, bad's out the way - now the good! The film is very well written; the script is very tight and has clearly been cut down for efficiency yet still natural and the acting is brilliant also. All characters are very convincing and Bradley Cooper's intelligent Eddie is so entertaining, convincing and endearing that you eventually love the character and rejoice every time he has to explain anything to the normal humans. Some of the action scenes are a bit naff, but otherwise very well done, but besides Bradley Cooper's performance, I'd say the main prize goes to the director - Neil Burger. My hat goes off to him for his visual imagination - his transitions between different locations are the best I've ever seen in a film and it really encapsulates Eddie's disorientation when he blacks out on and off. The effects used to illustrate the effects of the drug are also brilliant; sometimes you forget the voice over and just get lost in the special effects - such as the one in the trailer when the letters fall from the ceiling. The only thing I would complain about is the fact that he often uses extreme close ups excessively and it gets a bit distracting, but nothing compared to how compelling this film was. It was clever, but not genius, it was thrilling, but not mind blowing - it was just a lot of fun. Definitely worth seeing if you're an aspiring director or just a person with eyes in their face.",Limitless

260,sculptagain-1,A Great Movie that missed satisfaction,8,1 December 2011,"As a review I would start with the filming. It was great New York City all over. And that's good. Pasting the city scape into the movie was done well - as if the editor knew the city well. And I like that. Casting was OK and did not reach too far into the Toy world of greed and money, but instead used the filming to tell the story without Glitz and Glamour to prove the point of the story. Music was OK without adding pop or street crawl. It was good and basic background music that fit, as I said, OK. The writing was great as far as it went. Perhaps I just needed More !! And a sequel just may be the answer. I can't see a series erupting from this - but a sequel could move into other realms of the Sci-Fi world's movie stories. Much like Michael Caine's ""Harry"" moved through time and space - so could ""Limitless."" There was a terrible amount of holes to be filled throughout the movie as the end came near. And then the ending of the story. It was like an Aesop's Fable with someone telling you the moral of the story instead of it spinning in your own mind. That leaves too many questions, loopholes, and a scenario that yearns for a sequel just to see the final ending. It is an 'almost' great movie only lacking in answers. Everyone played their part well - from the filming, casting, crew, writers, actors, etc. Something is missing. . . And I hate to see DeNiro not finish something once he has taken the Pill of Success.I give this movie a 7 out of 10. I could see another production easily raising that much higher. But we know that won't happen in this world of Copyrights. My biggest problem (and please forgive me for this fault I have always had) is that this movie like so many other good but not great movies end too quickly without giving me satisfaction. Perhaps this should have been a Mini Series expanding on all the aspects of the characters much deeper - expanding outside of Downtown Manhattan - expanding the plot longer for each change and outcome of situations. It's a problem I have always had with great movies that end without satisfaction.",Limitless

262,imdb2-556-923983,"Original, creative, enjoyable",8,3 April 2011,"I feel it needs to be said that this is a superhero movie. We've had a myriad of superhero movies in recent years, but only a handful (e.g. the first Iron Man) were films where it seemed to me cast and crew were not fast asleep but actually cared about what they were doing. This is definitely an example of that rare breed. It is one of those movies where you spend the entire length of the film NOT noticing that it is a superhero movie, and quite possibly this will not dawn on you even on the ride home, because the subject matter is handled seriously: the characters are 3d life-like people; the plot has life-like complexity; there is ambiguity and room for interpretation. Somebody cared. I had my doubts, going in, whether Bradley Cooper can pull this one off. He sure can. Other actors are also at the top of their game. (I don't feel I need to pick out De Niro in particular, here.)So, the good: Original, creative writing. Original, creative, beautiful cinematography. Original, creative direction. Interesting throughout. Believable, except when it isn't trying to be. Good pacing. Well acted.The bad: Some scenes stretch credulity. Most by just a little. The fore-last scene is over the top. I loved it. (My wife said: ""They're trying to pull a Tarrantino. Right?"" and they were.) I can't blame anyone who says this scene ruined the movie for him. It isn't believable. It isn't consistent with the rest. But it's definitely where the roller-coaster that is this movie is at its most extreme. By contrast, the last scene left me with a feeling of something missed. It's like the script saves the best for the sequel.So, unfortunately, this movie doesn't have an ending that makes you forgive it for everything else. Quite on the contrary. It just happens to be so good that I was willing to forgive it its bad ending.",Limitless
263,mwartoad,Really good,7,17 May 2011,"I just caught this as a matinée. Very well done. It has a strong, intelligent plot where not everything is laid out. The plot kept me guessing. Bradley Cooper did a an excellent job. I really love his character arch and transformation that he brings here. He is strong and vulnerable at the same time. He really holds his own in the scenes he has with Robert Deniro, no mean feat.Of course their is Bobby D. My God this guy is amazing. I don't know how he does it. Whether he is playing a thug , a boxer, cop, honest bus driver, Taxi driver ready to go over the edge, missionary, fearless leader in Bullwinkle he always believable and stunning. Maybe he could be nicknamed UPS because he always delivers. Here is no exception, he plays the Wallstreet billionaire antagonist with depth and intensity.The only issue I have with this film is the bit with the Russian gangster. In these scenes the film really goes off the rails and becomes silly and downright hokey. The way that the hero gets his medication from the gangster in the fight scene is pretty ridiculous. They could have cut this character out and focused on the focused more on the story around the Deniro character.

266,mohan_i,What a vastly over rated stinker !!!,5,4 April 2013,"This must be like one of the most ridiculous films I have seen with gaping plot holes, suspension of belief and all notwithstandingI can understand that scriptwriters have to take liberties with the script to get the film going, set the pace right, make the story interesting and so onbut there is a limit and frankly this steaming pile of dog-turd strained my credulityUnlike low-budget, 'leave-your-brain-at-home', C-grade flicks which you watch with low expectations, this film has no such excuse. The fact that this is a mega budget movie with big movie stars (Bradley Cooper, for god's sake) and has a 71% rating on rotten tomatoes seriously leads me to question the direction in which Hollywood movies are headedThis is a supposedly intelligent movie with novel and interesting premisea super drug which enhances the mental abilities of anybody who pops itsounds good??? Let's talk about the most stupid plot holes which I have arranged in descending order (most stupid coming first and so on)1) The whole point of the drug is that whoever stops taking it falls sick and eventually dies, which is presumably the reason the drug dealer himself does not take it and become a business tycoon, president or somebodyso much is made out of its side effects throughout the filmhowever at the end of the movie, our hero has shrugged off the habit quite easily and still retained his mental super-abilitiesvery convenient huhand he explains this off in such a matter of fact manner, which De Niro accepts without question 2) The hero is not shown to be especially sharp or intelligentin fact he is a failure and a loser, who claims to be a writer, but has been unable to write a single wordyet he figures out something that the other users could not (including his extremely smart ex-wife)that if he eats on time, he can control the side effects of the drug 3) Bradley explains in a voice-over that he has forked out several million dollars for personal security – hiring professional bodyguards, renting a fortress like apartment with latest technology etc to keep away from the Russian thugsthe smug smile on his face (visible only to the audience) when he finalises the deal for the multimillion dollar apartment suggests that he has bested his opponentshowever in the climax of the movie, they bust in with utmost easeand before that they bump off his freakishly huge professional bodyguardswhat is the point of investing so much in personal security if a band of thugs can get too you without breaking a sweat??? 4) The thing about the hero sipping on the thug's blood to get back his super abilities really cracked me upcome onwhen you inject a drug, it gets diluted across your entire blood streamhow does he get the full benefit just by sipping on a little blood??? 5) Why would a guy with enhanced mental abilities, a super smart person borrow money from a dangerous gangster and then forget to pay it backand which retarded person grabs a pill from a relative stranger's hand and pops it without considering the potential harm??? Yet that is exactly what the Russian gangster does 6) At the end of the movie, De Niro (for some inexplicable reason) wants Cooper to work for him, presumably for his artificially enhanced mental abilitieshe reveals that he now owns the company that produced the drugbut in that case, why would Niro want to hire a guy who is a natural loser like Cooper and difficult to controlwon't a naturally genius and successful businessman like Niro have several super-smart guys already working for him, who can be enhanced with the drugor what is to prevent Niro from taking the drug himself and trying to become President of the United States??? His sudden and inexplicable switch from good guy to guy with negative shades, for no valid reasons, is difficult to digest 7) I figure that if I had a finite supply of the mind-enhancing drug, the thing to do would be to crank out a dozen or more best sellers before the supply runs outand then release them one at a timethis would rake in the millions by way of royalties and make me famousno super smart person would play the money market game to get rich as that would raise a thousand questionsI know that you are supposed to ignore small things and not think too much while watching a moviebut this entire film is an excellent example of deus ex machine (a plot device to solve a seemingly unsolvable problem suddenly and abruptly, with the contrived intervention of some new, unexpected eventfrequently used when the writer has ""painted himself into a corner"")the acting and other aspects are adequate, but I could not pay much attention to anything else as I was too incredulous with the ludicrous storyline",Limitless
267,tsettles98,wow! What a great movie!,8,18 March 2011,"I have wanted to see this movie ever since I saw the first trailer pop up on my home screen for the IMDb app. The trailer made it look amazing and I saw that it was based off of a book. I read the book and absolutely loved it and I decided that the movie was a shoe-in. I saw it on opening day just a few minutes ago and it was just amazing!Basically the movie starts off with our main guy, Eddie (Bradley Cooper), about to jump from the building but chooses not to and goes on to tell us his story. He meets up with an ex-brother-in-law who gives him a small pill that allows him to access the rest of his brain in a matter of minutes. Usually it takes us a while to try to remember something that happened to us twenty years ago. With this pill, he can remember that stuff instantly!But soon his dealer is killed by hit men who wanted the drug (entitled NZT-48). He finds the stash and uses it in the stock market and gets 2 million dollars. This brings in a man named Carl Van Loon who hires Eddie as his associate. It's funny because Robert De Niro's character isn't even the main bad guy. It's some Russian dude who wants Eddie's NZT. But, of course, there are side-effects. After he becomes behind on his dosage, his brain begins to skip time and he can't remember what just happened to him. He later gives a chick a very bad disease that kills her and he hadn't even remembered well enough to tell his very qualified lawyer who was to help him in this case. His stash begins to dwindle so the whole dosage side affect issue becomes a problem, especially with the very dangerous Russian wanting it. He then finds his pills are stolen. He discovers that his lawyer stole them to find out what happened to the chick. We then finally come back to him about to jump. The Russian breaks in and tries to kill him. Although Eddie manages to kill him instead. Earlier, the Russian mentioned to Eddie that he liquefied it so he could shoot it instead. When Eddie kills him, the blood is the only thing he can use to beat the hit men and get out of there. He drinks it and goes to a man who could help him get to the man who took his stash. He gets it.The happy ending is that he used scientists to help him ""tweak"" the NZT so that it won't cause side-effects and he won't need to take it so often. This was a great movie that was very fast paced, yet somehow slow paced at the same time, since it had felt much longer than 1hour and 45minutes. The ending was very quick and abrupt making it hard to recall, as were some of the other twists, but I still managed to figure it out by paying close attention. Overall, this is a great movie that I would recommend to anyone but young kids who'd be confused throughout the whole thing. Great movie.5 out of 5. 9 out of 10. See it.",Limitless

If you haven't watched any of these movies i can tell you that Limitless is a pretty good thriller that makes you feel thrilled, what a thriller should do. Using the urban legend of humans not using 100% of their brain and a pill that can do so, the story is pretty good, but as again, the ending isn't so.

269,Seraphima12,Induced 'Mind Magic' or Cure from Writer's Block,8,17 March 2018,"I find this movie both fascinating and at the same time limiting. It also unwittingly reflects on the questions of our mind, subconscious, creativity, abilities and what we can do with it all. I'd say that the way these notions are portrayed in the movie is more of a male view on the situation. Creativity cannot be forced and writer's blocks can be unblocked in so many other ways but by a single pill. 
Mastery, for me, lies not in taking pills to unlock our great abilities, hidden talents and enter the subconscious but by looking into ourselves, uncovering our own values, truths, talents and at the same time staying open to the world around us, staying tuned in, also using our intuition as well as logic. In a combination they are very powerful. 
On the other note, the struggles of the main protagonist, Eddie Morra, reminded me of so many writers, especially male ones, who try to solve everything by force, pills, drugs or alcohol and forget that the most powerful source is within us. They just should start using their intuition and creative side to unlock it. Having said that, I still believe it was fun to watch the movie to see how it will all end up.",Limitless

(he wouldn't have had the authority to buy that much equity to begin with) or getting enough of a drug someone's blood to give you a fix? (the average human body has eight quarts of blood, lapping up a couple spoonfuls isn't the equivalent of getting a ""hit"") or forgetting to pay off a Russian loan shark (a genius would have remembered something that might cost him his life)).Also found the acting of both Cooper and DeNiro to be mediocre. Maybe I've seen him in too many other films, but Cooper seems to have this permanent smirk on his face, even when it doesn't make sense for his character to.Thought the angle with ""Hank Atwood"" could have been developed better, indeed the entire concept that others in the business world were also on the drug could have been developed much more fully, and even turned into an implicit societal critique of Wall Street-style ""manic capitalism"". As it was, I thought the implicit critique was about drugs in general, but antidepressants specifically (the fact that it was manufactured by a pharmaceutical company, rather than a meth lab or coke dealer etc.). Also thought that angle could have been developed better, judging from the other reviews here (no one else else mentions antidepressants, just drugs in general) this message (if indeed that was the director's intent) was too subtle.Thought Deniro's role would have been much larger after having seen a trailer (I thought he was going to be in the know from the get-go about Cooper's secret, and the movie would be about the power struggle between the two of them). So maybe I was a little disappointed by having the movie not be what I expected.Did find it interesting at the end that the question of his continued usage was not answered--would be curious to know what others thought--I'm not sure myself (that's the point I guess--it's like a French film, you're supposed to leave the theater and have a healthy discussion with your friends about what really happened).",Limitless

While it is quite entertaining, it ultimately fails to satisfy in the final reel as it devolves from a cautionary tale into a happy ending for the drug-taking protagonist. The message of the movie becomes take a pill, become successful. Would it were that easy. The drug in question, NZT, which sounds dangerously close to AZT, creates an effect on the brain where the user can remember any and everything he ever read or has been exposed to and can instantly organize and access the information. The user can now use 100% of her brain instead of the ""normal"" 20% we usually can access. The drug creates a startling focus and uber ability on the part of the user. The special effects were done quite well, creating the illusion of a drug trip resembling a cross between a meth induced high and an LSD excursion. The down sides to the drug were well documented and most people who have been on the drug are either burned out or dead. Eddy finally finds a way to maintain. This is where the film finally loses me. Up to that point it maintains a certain integrity to the material and I could suspend disbelieve long enough to buy what the storytellers were selling, but at the end, it all falls away and I lose my thrall.

277,staff-577-378882,Review: Limitless,7,18 March 2011,"What if one little pill could change your life by bringing about wealth, power, and all else you've ever wanted? What would you give up for this miracle? Money? Family? Control? An idea has been around for ages that we only use 10% of our brains while the other 90% stores old reruns of That 70s Show. Much has been fantasized about what one could achieve if they could only tap into this unknown potential from incontestable intelligence to psychic abilities to Heroes-esque super powers. While this myth has been widely debunked, Limitless (based off of the novel The Dark Fields) embraces this fantasy in a very grounded way. Supposing that a street drug can light up one's remaining synapses, a user can access all they've ever read, heard, and experienced for a few hours like an overpowered Adderall Eddie (Bradley Cooper of The Hangover, Alias) is a grungy writer who can't write, pay the rent, or get his life in order. Then the night before he is due to turn in his first draft of his still mere idea of a novel, he runs into his sketchy ex-brother-in-law-drug-dealer-other-dashes who offers him a taste of a brain enhancing designer drug. Suddenly, Eddie finishes his draft, gets a haircut, and turns life around with such fluidity that even he still can't comprehend what just happened in the past 8 hours. Needless to say, he needs more. More leads to wealth as he plays the stock market and leads to fame as his book is unbelievably brilliant and confidence as this corner dweller now has the intellect and brawn to own the room. But there are consequences from taking and withdrawing from this drug leaving him addled with blackouts, headaches, and maybe an STD. Throw in some baddies and a corporate monolith run by Robert De Niro seeking Eddie's financial ""scheme"", well, then, things suddenly take a turn for the worst.Director Neil Burger (The Illusionist) takes us through this stream of consciousness in a style similar to David Fincher crossed with Tony Scott; capturing Eddie's fluid perception of handling complex situations with unnatural ease. A hit or miss for most audiences will be the narration throughout the film, though. While apropos with the protagonist being a writer suffering from clairvoyance, the omniscient first person is hard to accept.It would also be interesting to see the alternate endings supposedly filmed as the one chosen has ""test screening audience vote"" written all over it.Limitless is an interesting take on an old idea that feeds on ""what ifs"".

It is a real good example of what happens in real life, when someone comes across something of great power (or money), and how so many people will try to screw you over to obtain it. Also, there is a great side story which reflects everyones struggles to obtain and maintain a meaningful romantic relationship with someone, and the struggles people go through to become their ultimate, ideal image of themselves; while battling with greed and moral issues. The little tiff between McCormick, De Nero, and the foreign guy was a little tacky, it was by far not one of De Nero's best performances, but it was good enough to not be distracting.Other than that, all other aspects of the movie were very good.

The plot was good but in some ways it moves slow and doesn't give you a lot. However it does wake you up with the way the camera rolls.

281,virtualimmigrant,Only the Quantity of NZT is the Limit.,7,31 January 2019,"I first saw 'Limitless' in 2011 when it had its original run in cinemas. So, watching that film now, it somehow feels so 2010. Stylistically, I mean. There is some certain style or atmosphere in science fiction and action movies made between 2007-2012 that I can only call 2010ish. Don't ask me why I get such a feeling.'Limitless' had quite original premise upon its release, and the thing is it still feels fresh. I guess I haven't seen a movie handling similar subject matter. The things that bothered me almost nine years ago are the same ones that bother me today. Some more, some less. First, lets start with that 'we only use limited part of our brain'. The character Vernon (Johnny Whitworth) says that we can access 20% of our brain, while the well known urban myth is about 10%. As we find out, the Vernon is not the brightest guy, it is obvious that this myth was thrown in by the screenwriters to give an easy explanation to the audience (from whom large part are not very bright themselves), and also show the shallowness of the character. The second problem was the unnecessary addition of the Russian mobster to just to amp up the thrills and have some cliche edge-on-your seat action scene. The screenplay could have been little more thought out. I think I don't need to praise Bradley Cooper's ability to turn in fantastic performance as out of luck writer turned into supergenius.Neils Burger's lavish visual style manages to turn very uneven screenplay into highly entertaining, and even thought provoking film that manage to work on many levels. I liked how the colors turned brighter when Eddie Morra was on NZT, and went back to greyer tones when he was 'himself'.This film also works somewhat as a motivational video - don't tell me you didn't get the desire to clean up your apartment after finishing the movie. I did. And remember, NZT does exist. It is all in our heads. And cleaning up your apartment is good way to start turning your life better.",Limitless
282,DTKinetic,Clever Fun...but Inconsistent,6,18 March 2011,"This movie with its premise sure does attract a lot of curiosity: What could happen if you take a pill that can: speed up your mind, and drastically increase your intelligence, therefore getting you a professional job with money and influence? Therefore, this movie definitely gets you to think. Some ""What would you do"" situations occur, and knowledge that Cooper's character goes into risky territory is really invigorating.Well, the movie took its premise in many different directions, unevenly jumping genres (from drama to suspense to drama to action to drama) and implicating multiple characters and conflicts into the screenplay, which in a way backfires. Yes, this means you will need to pay close attention to everything going on while crucial explanations can be very rushed (especially towards the end). The overall storyline seems overlong (felt like 2 hours 15 minutes), very choppy and inconsistent.Every time when conflicts are introduced they earn a nice scene or two, and are practically dropped, not sticking to the overall storyline. Examples including Eddie Morro (Cooper's) brain ""skipping moments"" and forgetting recent events, discovering the harsh and lethal side effects of abstaining from the pill, killers trying to track the users of the pill, etc. They all seem very temporary, while between these conflicts, the previous suspense is drowned out with talk: a good chunk of it sophisticated business-style conversation and generally maneuvering around the workplace. The movie does have its pros without a doubt though.Acting and Character development. Cooper's character has a strong dynamic change is very amusing to watch, seeing him go from a fatigued, on-the-brink author, not too much emotion in his life, to a happy confident smart-talking genius. De Niro made quite a firm/rigid impression as well. As you can imagine now that Cooper accesses 100% of his brain, the script is technical and poetic.The camera-work/editing/director of photography department is certainly a unique add...some may like it some may not. In a way makes it feel like you are on drugs, featuring intense tunnel zoom effects, view distortions, surrealism with nearby objects, and changing the color from a dull dingy shade before the pill to a lively burst of color afterward. Though the dingy side of the editing is viewed far more often and can be somewhat depressing/boring to look at.Some of the action--when there is action--is creative. I would have wanted to see more dazzling locations and paradise though.Overall, the movie was a good effort, had some smart scenes and performances, and the storyline is good at first, but it totally divides apart and wasn't as consistently entertaining as it should have been--unless you are okay with talk.6/10",Limitless

284,dacksonflux,Fun but deceptive,4,4 January 2017,"I appreciate a good motivational speech. I also appreciate the success driven ideologies North American society has taken in younger generations; I think it's a quality often overlooked.Then there are societal issues that are real life problems this movie only manages to exhibit and encourage.To begin with the movie was fun and entertaining. Nobody enjoys Bradley Cooper more than when he's a sad underdog with a soon-to-be new outlook on life. Very decent acting. Enjoyed the screenplay. Story was interesting. Robert De Niro was in it. Brought attention to the stock market and to business. What could be wrong with that?The idea that fame and fortune is ENTIRELY luck based, which it's not (entirely). The idea that dirty business is only the practice of old, old fashioned men. We all of course know it's not. Robert De Niro was made a fool. I didn't personally enjoy that. The idea that by participating in politics can somehow change the world for the better. The message of ,""If you're not extroverted you're probably too stupid to socialize"" was made apparent in the first fine minutes which is excessively offensive and harmful to a society that relies heavily on often (but not always) introverted tech. geniuses. Another message I got from this movie is, ""If you're addicted to drugs, don't worry. You can get off it as soon as you become rich.""The list goes on of how this movie could've easily been taken too seriously and a bit discouraging.There are points that I did appreciate and felt were on some level, realistic enough to relate to. There's a very fine line between illegal and legal business practice, and it's not always obvious. Politics and business are very close relatives. If you're not successful with what you thought was your calling, perhaps it's not your calling. Sometimes it takes an altered mindset to find and get what you want. Don't give up. Don't forget your goals. Have a backup plan.And so on with more motivational mumbo jumbo. Enjoy the movie but keep in mind it's no biography with scientific backing.",Limitless

287,Mummajojo,Take it or leave it... but please don't believe it!,5,30 April 2021,"The beginning really grabbed me, there are lots of us out there down on our luck, isolated, unemployed, depressed, impoverished.The relatable content of this scene is when you're down someone kicks you further down.Then in rolls the drugs, this is where I started to tap out. The glorification that one is more worthy, more intelligent, able to function to higher standards and is accepted by society when taking drugs is a dangerous message.The acting was incredibly believable. The emotion when seeing his dead x brother in law, the reaction, the response to send for help and cower in the corner like a frightened little mouse. All that taken away ~ for the potential for drugs.It was at this point where for myself had it on in the background but got up to do the folding.Basically if you like movies where the main character is on drugs otherwise is a depressed numbskull with suicidal thoughts, a main character that seems to have sex with multiple women because being intellectual makes every woman on the planet want to sleep with you, a main character that literally gets away with murder then this is the film for you.It does have mild gore, fight scenes and a decent cast.I am glad I didn't pay money to see this at the cinema. The other half fell asleep half way though giving me the opportunity after folding to write this review.Drugs are never the answer, getting to know people for whom they are regardless of their financial, social and or emotional status is what we all should be doing!Great acting by a great cast!

288,nadshi,rock stars in rehab,8,1 December 2013,"This movie was incredible. I didn't want to watch the movie because of the lead, I didn't like his work in 'All about Steve'. But he was believable/like-able/weird-dorky in this, in the same way that he's likable in The Hangover movies and Yes Man.The concept of a super-drug that makes people smarter than they originally are, is not unreal. Where smarter is defined as alert, attentive and calm. What most people would define as the state of being high. There have been many drugs that have helped users gain confidence, achieve mental clarity and so forth. There are always side effects though. The most publicized of these are Visual Hallucinations. Which are rare even with Schizophrenics(There's a lot of debate of whether there is such a thing as Schizophrenia among the psych community). John Nash never had anything other than auditory hallucinations. The drug has withdrawal effects which can be averted if the drug is tapered properly, this is the case with most psych drugs legal or illegal.There are assumptions that a hunch is a carefully calculated mathematical derivation based on all the information you have. In the day of Google all kinds of information is accessible but to put it all together and make it useful at all times though possible is not in the best interests of the corrupt gurus of the business world who (according to the movie) bribed their way to the top. The movie ignores misinformation, misunderstandings, deflection, lying, fraud and everything else that can't be seen through just by remembering things. Even if your memory is perfectly/accurate. The reason why the stock market isn't predictable is because companies don't disclose everything. If there was complete information/transparency everybody would know what stock will go up or down, and become rich. This movie perpetuates the myth that accurately predicting markets is a matter of intelligence and not luck/Corporate-Espionage. Anybody who believes this should read Nasim Taleb's Black Swan, a first year statistics/finance/mathematics text or watch the movie 21. Plot potholes that aren't potholes: Phantom Agony wrote a review highlighting plot defects. I deduce from the review that (A) Phantom never opened a law book in his/her life. Phantom would be surprised at how lax the police is when it comes to investigating serious crimes, especially when they involve family members (including the ex-brother-in-law) plus since NZT wasn't officially 'out' it wasn't officially illegal. All white powder is investigated in the scene of a crime but oil capsules are easily missed. There's no known illicit drug that's distributed or packaged in that form. There was absolutely no reason to assume he stole anything. Theft is investigated when theft is reported. Crime scene tampering is a problem only once the yellow tape is up or tampering can be proved. He didn't have a gun. He reported the crime. He stayed at the scene of the crime until the police arrived. That's all the police would be interested in at the time. Criticism (2) is also rife with contradictions, um he 'did' remember it was 'constantly' on his mind as Phantom admits. He was smart and he was occupied with other things. Smart people avail opportunities, super smart NZT people avail 'every' opportunity. (3) The people in this movie are using NZT a fictional super drug that looks like a Seven Seas capsule and makes people pay attention to mundane details and make use of them efficiently, nothing is far-fetched. Why couldn't the henchman figure it out and make connections that most people (the rest of us, who don't take the imaginary drug) can't make? That's the whole premise of the story. Of course he could make those connections, he was on NZT?",Limitless

This has been explored in a lot of movies in various different ways and follows the simple German folklore tale of Faust a man who makes a deal with Mephistopheles (the Devil) to gain access to the divine knowledge, once the pact is made his soul is damned for eternity.That is where this film falls down, although the set up is good and the characters and acting interesting it doesn't really explore anything with any real depth. The moral ambiguities of this gift or the repercussions of using it for either personal gain or to the benefit of mankind are never really thought of or considered. They appear as passing thoughts with no reflection or comment.You do get to see different types of people take the drug to explore how different people would use it, but this opportunity is lost really as the contrasts are broadly drawn and quickly stepped over.The central character seems to be rather one dimensional even with his gift and strands to the narrative are simply left open or unresolved.Having said all that, if you shut down your active mind and just look at the beautiful people and don't go looking to deep into the story what passes is a couple of hours of good fun, with some neat camera techniques, amazing visuals and an interesting premise that will get you thinking, if not really exploring the potential of the source material to the full itself.",Limitless

294,roumen-ad,Better went to sleep in (real) bed,5,10 June 2012,"I saw that film till the very end. I'd better go to sleep before it starts. But I was prepared for the worse and I had some time to be spent somehow. Well, if i didn't saw it, it was exactly the same but now I'm writing this review.I think it have to be some kind of autobiography or maybe hyper autobiography if such a genre exists. The movie is made to be sold and probably it was sold well exactly like the protagonist would do. So, I'll suspect, it'll be continued: the Eddie becomes a president (of USA of course) but wants to rule the world. The drug has transformed him to some kind of alien. At the very end of part two (I don't expect there would be part three) he'll meet her father who is the drug's inventor, but remember their old farm in Alabama. A final Oedipus dialog explain everything already happened.What did disturb me? If all that should be true, the rest lacks elementary logic. The drug increases the brain power to the 100%, not more (so was at least said, but very soon forgotten), but 100% endless stupidity is like 20% stupidity and even 0,1% stupidity, it's mathematics.But what did disturb me at most was that if someone should be so clever why should (s)he use her/his abilities to make (much) money? That's a really dangerous propaganda! And amoral message to the potential audience which is, I suppose, rather young. Why didn't use the supernatural abilities to teach the others being happier and possibly cleverer?Or maybe I am just the most stupid one because I can not steal money and goods from the others?

296,TheDarkKnight21,First Great Movie of 2011,9,31 March 2011,"Now this is how you make a movie. I don't know if it was the fact that I saw perhaps one of the worst movies ever dumped on screen last week or if I had seen something that really took me by surprise. Let's go with the latter, because one way or another, Limitless will somehow end up on my top 10 of the year. So for those who have been missing the previews, here's the basics. Bradley Cooper plays Eddie, a guy who seems to be on the top of the world (or rather a luxury skyscraper) and he's ready to end it all. After one of the slickest credits sequences ever put on film, we find that he was a guy who had hit rock bottom in his life after getting dumped by his girlfriend, failing to pay rent on time, and had consistently failed to type a single word for his novel. In other words, he was a loser...I mean artistic writer. By chance, he meets his ex-wife's brother-in-law who turns him on to a new drug called NZT. The drug might as well be called ""Charlie Sheen"" because this guy starts to win at basically life itself.In 24 hours, he scores with the young wife of his landlord, cleans up his messy apartment and finishes the first part of his overdue novel (that is immediately embraced by his editor). So after a good trip like that Eddie needs more. More of this drug to help him focus to not only finish his book, but learn languages, play the piano, score more girls, play the stock market, and whatever else he wants. Thus, what follows is an insane adrenaline-fueled odyssey as Eddie rises to power with the help of Charlie Sheen's tiger blood, all the while dealing with some psychotically bad side effects. How bad are we talking here? Say 18-hour blackouts where he remembers snippets of fights, parties, clubs, and random sex. Actually, now that I wrote that, those might be not-so-bad side effects.So what separates this film from other drug head films? Other films show how drugs make their users feel ""high"" or ""good"" for a while (which basically means doing jack), before the inevitable time where the user gets ""clean"" and goes through withdrawals. In essence, these films show how ""drugs are bad"" and how the road to recovery and redemption is a long and painful one. This is NOT one of those movies. This is a rise to power film.After Eddie is given his powers, we see him adjust to his new life and makes crucial decisions on where he takes his life next. But the drug not only gives Eddie supreme intelligence, but focus for goals. While it's never explicitly stated, Eddie simply wants the ""world and everything in it"". And this is what makes Limitless so entertaining. We are taken on a ride as Eddie moves up in the world and shown how he deals with his love life and his relationship with business partners. You never see what's coming next or predict how each character will fare in the movie. It's simply one surprise after another.Acting wise, Bradley Cooper shines in this film. You might as well call this his ""breakthrough"" role, cause he is the star of the show here. While his character never attains the infamy that other famous rise-to- power protagonists have (like Tyler Durden or Scarface), you are nonetheless drawn to his character and hope that he makes it through to see the next day. Abbie Cornish does a fine job and redeems herself in my eyes for Sucker Punch and proves to be both confident and competent as an actress. Pay attention to this one in the coming years. And thank God that Robert De Niro gets to have a role in a movie isn't worthless. He does his job as a Wall Street exec quite well and almost makes me want to see him in a broker movie. What really takes you on a ride in the movie, besides the great acting and tight script, is the direction. I cannot think of a single plot hole in the movie, even though a lesser film could have easily made that mistake. But the true star here is the cinematography as the camera tricks in this movie are so much fun. The only way for me to describe it, is like speeding through a tunnel of your depth perception. Picture yourself on a street and peer as far as your eye can see. What the movie does is quickly travel the length of your perception and keeps going and going. It gives you that beautiful feeling of omniscience. Simply put, you can see and hear everything.There are very few movies I walk out of a movie saying ""wow"". This movie was one of them. An adrenaline-fueled adventure that captivates you without a single explosion and leaves you completely satisfied. I won't give it a perfect rating since some characters were not fully memorable, but this film takes you on a ride you'll never forget. Run out and catch this movie anyway you can. It deserves it.",Limitless

Bradley Cooper makes for a charismatic star, the visual tricks employed by director Neil Burger are flashy bordering on trippy, and the supporting cast all do reasonable jobs. The dialogue however, is very clichéd, especially when Cooper is on ezt and talks as though he googled, ""how to sound clever"" The result is the kind of thing a gang of pretentious teenage boys might blurt out before being mocked incessantly for sounding pretentious, and kills the illusion that Eddie is as smart as the film thinks he is. There are also various issues with the people that follow the main character, as they seem to pick and choose when to threaten him, and when to simply wait in plain view. The whole film is oddly weightless, it left no emotional impact and I didn't particularly care about any of the characters, Coopers charisma and my need to see the next twist were all that kept me watching. Overall, a good, fun thriller, but one that could have used a slightly stupider premise, as the smart one it uses is utterly wasted",Limitless

So step right up and take The Limitless Express only $10.00 per ticket. The ride's dialogue is half narrating and half acting (how's that for being original). Let me tell you the plot before going to the ride. The film starts with a man named Eddie Mora (played be The Hangover's Bradley Cooper) about to commit suicide. Why? Well this story is mainly told through flashback. He was a writer with a bad case of writer's block (he only has one word in his book), his wife just broke up with him, and his brother in law came and gives him a drug called NZT-48 (he said that it's FDA approved but later we find out he stole it from the lab so its illegal). Eddie however decides to take it and became smarter in a few minutes. The drug however has some serious side effects that includes that if you stop taking NZT-48 you die, blackouts and becomes addicted to the drug as in one sequence Eddie murders a person and (don't say I didn't warn you) drinks his blood because his blood has the formula for NZT-48. This ride is well acted, has mind bending visuals (which makes it's $27 million dollar budget look like $70 million), and it's fast paced. So go on to Limitless. Warning: there are possible side effects that includes motion sickness and a possible angry complain to the writer that his script is uneven.",Limitless
300,RHewison,Superb surprise,8,22 December 2011,"This film was a fantastic surprise. I watched it without knowing anything about it and it was spectacular. It was visually astounding and the plot was superb.Reminding me slightly of Trainspotting, the film follows Eddie Morra, a down on his luck man suffering from major writers block. He bumps into his ex-wife's brother, who offers him a drug which changes his world forever. It begins with a scene from the middle of the film, whereby Eddie is standing on the edge of a building with people trying to hammer down the door behind him. It's a brilliant technique as it makes you wonder what has happened to him to build up to this point. The film just continues to get better and better.The soundtrack and score were so well tuned (pun intended) to the film and the colours and the production of the film were outstanding and the camera shots were used to their maximum potential. The most dazzling were the shots that zoomed through the city, first used in the opening sequence and then again to show the progression of Eddie's drug-fuelled day and how the world would seem to him. The acting talent was brilliant and Bradley Cooper was never an actor that I thought highly of, he was always just an 'ok' actor. This film showed his maximum potential and he portrayed Eddie spot-on. Robert De Niro was on form and special mention must go to Johnny Whitworth, who was fantastic. There are some obvious plot flaws, such as Eddie not being searched by the police after he has raided Vernon's flat for his drugs, however this did not undo the film at all for me; I really didn't want it to end. All in all a great (if unexpected) watch perfect for those times when you can't quite decide what it is you want to see.",Limitless
301,jaysser,"Creative, but expected better",7,14 September 2013,"I would like to point out that the idea of the mysterious pill is unique and creative. The movie's plot is revolved around this pill which can be viewed as a good substance to enhance the brain's functioning, while destructing the process of human activity. If it were me, I would have never taken the pill as it would have ruined my conscience. Rather than making him a better person, it turned Eddie Morra to a vicious man (he killed that woman in the hotel).The making of the film was well-done. There were clearly lots of effort put into editing, picture enhancement and special effects. Also, I loved the acting, in general. Bradley Cooper shows lots of talent, especially in the scene where he finds Vernon dead in his apartment. Even-though it didn't affect the film's general outcome, I expected a more extended, interesting role for Robert De Niro.Regarding the script, it is well-written, but I think it could have been more appealing with more action and suspense, which would have better attracted the audience.",Limitless

I just would have expected a different ending as it remains pretty much open whether Eddie will get off the drug at any rate or just mass-produces it in own laboratories. Neither unclear remains the question about Melissa's future. Yes, she got away with it, however her body took a lot of consequence there. It would have been nice to see a little more of her in the end. De Niro as Carl van Loon was absolutely enjoyable, he performed really well. At the first glance I didn't expect anything while watching the movie, however the story shows you all kinds of ways to see the world out of different views.

304,prishelec,Fun and somewhat unconventional,10,6 July 2011,"What I liked most of all about this movies is unconventional approach to the superhuman ability.For years Hollywood used the same model about people with such abilities - it's either temporary/bad for them or they have to devote their lives to the good of the community which made them miserable. It's a solid pattern but it becomes boring - look at all superheroes comics adaptations.There is a certain appeal for broader public in such model - if everyone is equal in it's abilities, no one would feel bad :) When watching this movie I was expecting just that - he takes the drug, it's all rainbows and sunshine, then he would discover some side effect that would make taking it impossible and the rest of the movie would be watching him stop using it. He would just go back to being normal but would get the girl because he is ""the nice guy"".I was pleasantly surprised! He actually manages to keep using it :) This is something I wouldn't expect from Hollywood movie.I like to this pattern breaking. First one I noticed was Iron Man when main character was allowed to have fun throughout the movie.",Limitless
305,RedemptionSong2,Succeeded its Potential,8,18 March 2011,Limitless for me when I first saw its trailer was a movie that was meant to be for pure entertainment. But for me I was pleasantly surprised. The movie actually had a plot kept you entertained and managed to surprise you at times. Don't get confused thinking your going to see an Oscar Winning movie because your not. You know what your getting when you see the trailer and want to go see it. As I said the movie is more than pure entertainment. Bradley Cooper does not disappoint. It is a movie you see and inspires you to be somewhat of a better person. I'm not advising people to do drugs by any means. All I'm saying is walking out of this movie I wanted to be a more productive version of myself. Achieve the things that I want to achieve. Strive to be a better me. And this is what I go to see movies for. To motivate and stimulate my emotions.If you haven't seen it yet. Its worth your money.8/10,Limitless

He meets an old friend who gives him an experimental drug that helps him use 100 percent of his brain. This drug helps him turn his life around and become much more confident and successful. This film is full of one great montage after another, plus the jump cuts get your mind racing to keep up. The interesting thing is that's how the main character feels in the film as well. Its almost as if your being put into the main characters head as you watch. The scenes are crisp and the cinematography is clean.

The acting from the cast made it very enjoyable to watch and made me go to see it twice in the movie theatres and no dough I will get it on DVD. The story line of how a writer with no creative ideas comes across a pill that makes you use your whole brain is definitely something I like to find. Although some of the scenes were great. I still can't say I understood the ending as much as I would have liked. Even the second time I was still laughing at the same time and still shocked at most moments. I would warn you if blood makes you scream some of the end scene may do that. If you like the idea of everything coming to you easily see this movie as it shows the ups and downs of using this so called pill and seeing that even though its a great thing to use it will eventually kill you or other people for everyone will want a piece of you brillianceBut I would say most people would enjoy this film especially if you like action, blood and laughter. It is definitely worth paying to see. I gave it a 9 because I think to give it a 10 they would of needed to show a bit more of the back round of how to pill came to life.",Limitless

Granted, the pill in the film has a few more attributes and is a posh, designer drug in clear format, but the concept surely has crossed every college students mind right around hour twenty of studying for their final grade. The film is entertaining however and although I am still not sure how I feel about it, I am certain I wouldn't want to watch it a second time and so I can not rate it very high. In the end the movie would be a good view for a discussion group or a class on Drug misuse, because both my husband and I wondered what we would do? Would such a drug make the world a better place or simply cause a faster destruction of the planet. Would we, as humans want to be overachievers with our brains and bodies going full speed all the time, and truly be limitless or is life better at a natural pace?

You have seen it before where a common man gets his hand on something which changes his world but he forgets that you have to pay for what you take (Not every movie is Alladin). What makes this move different is the execution which will earn you your money.Limitless stars Bradley Cooper as a writer whose last book wasn't a success and he hasn't written a word since then. Then he meets one of his old acquaintances and gets what's essentially a high IQ drug and everything changes. As he becomes more successful his path cross with Robert De Niro and Anna Friel. Both have their reasons to be in his life. And then there is Abbie Cornish who tries to be the ideal girlfriend. All in all, Limitless has a very decent cast who deliver what you expect (to an extent).What makes this movie different is the execution. 10 out of 10 to the writer and the Director for the treatment. The mood of the movie literally changes every time Bradley is taking his drugs. The ending is abrupt. I wish they would have paid more attention to it.All in all, Limitless is decent fun movie. You will enjoy it as long as you don't have high expectations (again not every movie is Alladin).",Limitless

311,vocator,TAKE A TRIP INTO THE WORLD OF LIMITLESS,8,18 November 2019,"""Limitless"" (2011) is a science-fiction film directed by Neil Burger. The thriller is about a drug called NZT-48 which enables to use the full potential of your brain.Neil Burger did a good job on finding the perfect pace for ""Limitless"" and not string the film unnecessarily out. And although the writers sometimes forgot to implement logic into the script, the idea of the movie is pretty interesting.The idea is based on the ""10% brain usage myth"" which says that we are only able to use a little part of our brain while the remaining big part is not usable. Today we know that this is not true. We use 100% of our brain. But nevertheless it is still worth a discussion if there can be a drug in the future which speeds our learning process and improves our brain on a whole new level. This topic would give more science into the fiction. Which would also turn the spotlight on the side effects that can arise.Furthermore, the soundtrack is very well composed (""Happy Pills""). The music together with the picture that zooms in but never ends and other well done effects, it gives the audience a feeling of how the character is experiencing the effects of the drug.In the end you get a more or less interesting science fiction movie which thrills you till the end to see what life changing the drug is. Bradley Cooper as the main character was a great choice. He was as convincing as the rest of the cast.That's why ""Limitless"" gets from me 7.5 out of 10 points.",Limitless

314,nosiru,Top Notch Entertainment,9,30 March 2011,"Limitless is an Action/Thriller film Directed by Neil Burger (same guy that brought us The illusionist, 2006). This film is about a writer who discovers a top-secret drug which gives him super human abilities. Its Starring Bradley Cooper, Robert De Niro, Abbie Cornish, Anna Friel, John Whitworth, Robert John Burke & Tomas Arana.#FACT: This film is based on the 2001 novel The Dark Fields by Alan Glynn.SLIDER'S REVIEW:Watching the trailer was exciting enough to get me psyched to watch this film. The plot looked fresh & fun plus the feeling of going on a journey with a man with no limits is intriguing. The front man Bradley Cooper has been a knockout in his recent performances like Hangover & A Team so I was not expecting any less.Everything I expected this film is to be is exactly what it was – Top End Entertainment. The moment it started I was engaged till the end. This had a original story feel to it and, it doesn't go too deep that you gets lost in questions like how's this drug even possible. It even tries to makes you believe the story is real. It doesn't even beat around the bush it just goes straight to the good stuff. Our main character Eddie starts off as a writer who then goes into other business areas but the longer he was taking these pills for the bigger his problems became. We go into a world of super intelligence that you won't want to come out of. The longer it went on for the more interesting it became. I for one wouldn't mind a part 2.This film manages to mix in a few genres that kept on surprising. I just didn't know what else they could throw in. The effects used merge into this film perfectly because they found a way to show us what the main character was feeling and how it was happening to him. It didn't get in the way it just looked really cool.From the good guys to the bad ones, everybody acted superbly in their roles. Bradley Cooper does a sensational job as Eddie Morra. His character transforms in a blink of an eye (literally) and he becomes this superhuman that was just awesome to watch. This is a journey of self-discovery that just has to be seen (Makes you imagine what super YOU could be like). I liked Robert De Niro character Carl Van Loon, he played this intimidating straight talking businessman who role was taken seriously. Abbie Cornish stars as Eddies Girlfriend Lindy, she also does a great job on screen. I liked it when her character was backed up against the corner and had only one choice. Anna Friel plays Melissa, her character brought a sense of realness to this storyline. She was an aftermath that we didn't know about and was surprising to see.#FACT: Shia LaBeouf was supposed to star as Eddie Morra but had to give away his role due to a car accident where he injured his arm.",Limitless

There is a guy with a bag of magic pills which i will steal and hide in my pants from the cops who are in the middle of the crime scene . Don't get me wrong the movie was full with that kind of scenes that movie just make you think about a lot of thing like Why the other people who takes pills didn't become millionaires ? Why the drug dealer who has magic pills didn't take pills and fix his life ? Why Carl Van Loon didn't take some pills from the lab that he owns ? Why the smartness guy in the world didn't think it's suspicious to make 2 millions from 10 000$ for 10 days ?

A very intriguing idea, a wonder drug which can make the user a virtual potentate, with some unfortunate side effects. The actors do a good job in bringing out the well-written story.Edward ""Eddie"" Morra (Bradley Cooper) is a writer who lives in New York City. He has recently been dumped by his girlfriend Lindy (Abbie Cornish) in addition to failing to meet the deadline to turn in his new book, which he hasn't started yet. One day, Eddie comes across Vernon Gant (Johnny Whitworth), the brother of his ex-wife, Melissa Gant (Anna Friel). Vernon is a drug dealer, and he offers Eddie a sample of a new (fictional) nootropic drug, NZT-40, claiming it allows humans to access 100% of the brain's power, as opposed to the ""normal"" 20%. Eddie accepts, and, much to his surprise, the drug does indeed work, putting him into a manic state, and enabling him to write the first 90 pages to his book, exciting his publisher.The movie goes on to detail the positive, and negative effects of the powerful elixir.

Yes, the movie may not have touched the heights of Christopher Nolan but certainly made a statement of its own. Bradley Cooper has again shown his class. Robert de Niro is also a pleasure to see.

He decides to up his ante to 100. This movie takes on a crazy ride that fills your entire body with an adrenaline rush that has a lasting effect. Bradley Cooper acts in a way you won't feel he's acting. Robert de Niro is a perfect thug to Cooper's innocent but soon to become mafia of sorts. Abbie Cornish is the only person who spoils an other wise perfect cast. She is irritating and just spoils the whole experience. But alas!

For example, you may find yourself wondering why the protagonist, of all people, would be the first one to iron out the kinks of the drug. The drug, after all, was originally developed by a multi-billion dollar pharmaceutical company--with apparently no ambitious drug-popping employees who might also figure out how to properly calibrate the drug themselves. This question begs others, which will in turn beg yet more.

I didn't feel it was totally predictable, and the plot is gripping. Had me sitting on the edge of my seat within the first few scenes. Well directed and acted throughout. Not too many special effects, which seems to be he mainstay of films these days, but enough to keep the viewer surprised.

326,julio-m-henriquez,I just don't recommend you to watch it using more than 20% of your brain,6,27 June 2011,"I don't know how to say this without going too far or being very misunderstood. Limitless is a terrible, terrible movie. Not the kind of movie that should burn but the one that is disappointing because of a lot of stupidity. Okey, I went too far. Despite all I disliked from the film, it is very entertaining. I loved the concept story, I just think it's poorly constructed and some how insulting to my intelligence. Bradley Cooper plays Eddie Morra an unemployed writer who has lost his track. He has a book contract but no inspiration. His life is so unorganized he simply looks like he's living in the street. Not even his girlfriend Lindy (Abbie Cornish) is up for this anymore. All this suddenly changes when he is introduced by his ex-brother in law (Johnny Whitworth) to an experimental drug the guys in the lab call NZT-48.What this drug does? It let's you use 100% of your brain. First, it is not true that humans only use certain portion of brain power. What I guess they mean is it makes you smarter. Something that is possible, though not in the present time.Needless to say, under the influence of the drug Eddie becomes some sort of Übermensch. He writes his novel in a few days, he's constantly focus, learns foreign languages with ease and remembers everything he has ever read, seen or heard. He is the man! NZT-48 enhanced him.As any modern male with no girlfriend, at first, Eddie used his new powers to get chicks and outshine experts in cultural circles he would've never been allowed. He's just running wild until he forms the idea where to use his abilities. The financial market.Without going into more details I'll just add that here we are presented Carl Van Loon (Robert De Niro), apparently one of the most powerful man in the country, who is naturally interested in Eddie's abilities. As expected, he plays his part very cool.I also liked Andrew Howard occasional appearances as the gangster who tasted Eddie's secret power pill and torments him in search for more.Director Neil Burger did some very cool takes with the fish lens, though I didn't get the use (maybe he wanted to show that Eddie had a wider perception?). Also the use of intermittent full color gives the film a very nice touch. Except for some totally unnecessary scenes, I think he did good job delivering an entertaining summer flick.In conclusion if you're after a thriller to watch this days this one won't leave you feeling you lost your money. I just don't recommend you to watch it using more than 20% of your brain because limitless is a very limited movie that doesn't consider the implications of such a medication on the real world.",Limitless

Good job, Mr. Cooper. This movie's plot is pretty intriguing, and its possibility really excites the audience. But the plot has so many holes, that it does not take a genius to offer alternate ways to respond to the various crisis in the movie. The visual effects and color alterations effectively take the audience into ""an alternate state of mind"", which really adds to the plot of the movie. Over all, this movie is worth watching because it is visually and intellectually enjoyable. However, the plot and writing could have been better.",Limitless
328,MarcusViniciusBSiqueira,Very good movie but could have a better end.,9,26 March 2017,"The movie is great and the actors play really well. I like Bradley Cooper and his acting was pretty nice. Jumping deep in the review of some points. These kind of drug in the movie, doesn't really exists as far as I know, but there is a medicine called Ritalin, that increases the focus, but this stuff is only for people who have problem of focus, so a doctor would give you a prescription. One interesting point about the drug thing, is that, you can't just turn your back in the drug. You can't just stop and that is it. I myself take a medicine, witch all of you should know, medicines are drugs too, so in my case, I take a specific prescription for years that I cant just stop, or else I will have side effects. Drugs, all of them, medicine or not, have side effects even if you can't really notice. There is no magic pill that would grant you a very good effect and take nothing of you. What I expected more at the ending of the movie was that this fact could really be there, and Morra himself, addicted, would meet a dead end. It worked really well when shown the side effects, the problems, the other who perished by the use of the drug, but somehow Morra ended up well. Well, at least for the movie ending, but if you think ahead, maybe in 2 years, when he is out of stock, he would just suffer and probably fall. As an illegal substance, even if he could maintain a secret lab for the pills, he would soon or later get discovered. Well, I still think the message was clear. There is no magic thing that could make you god without not taking anything from you.",Limitless
329,kabukiman2032,Nauseating American fairy tale,2,1 January 2016,"Technically this is a pretty well made movie with some decent actors. The basis of the story is good and the theme of loser gets his revenge on the system by cheating thanks to a drug is an interesting one. It echoes some very real behaviors going on all the time in the capitalist world from repulsive greedy douchebags who only think of themselves, money and nothing else and are ready to trod on anyone to get always more.The sickening part is that not only does this movie refuse to acknowledge the downside to only thinking of yourself and showing off your gifts to the point of nauseating anyone watching, it actually considers that it should all end happily with no smashing into a wall at full speed as the obvious final consequence, much like the financial crash of 2008. And don't get me started on a democratic political career as the ultimate way to exert one's brilliance and influence the system, what a joke. The reality of someone actually behaving like the character in this movie is that they would be alone and stay that way since no one except hookers could stand being around such a pretentious show-off for very long.One more nail in the intellectual coffin that is this tale is the disgusting shallowness of the pretty girlfriend who suddenly finds him attractive again once he has more money. Vomit.I have known people who doped themselves to get ahead and I am not sure they are happier than me where they are now, even if they make more money or have more power. They are so wrapped up in their own egos that they have to feed it through ever more status symbols as they are prisoners of a system that is wearing them out even as they think they are winning because they have a nice house or boat. To sum up this film had great potential in it's theme but fails miserably to show any moral end to the story. Instead of inciting the audience to reflect on the absurdity of wanting always more, the faster the better, in a world of overpopulation, exploitation and vast misery for countless ordinary people, the makers of this movie chose to ignore all this and pretend that there are no negative sides to behaving like a pig. I suppose that depressing the viewer with some truths is not good for Hollywood profits so again we are treated like idiots and fed a fairy tale where you need to leave your brain at the theatre entrance.

In fact, here's the expert's opinion on the subject, taken from Wikipedia: ""Neurologist Barry Gordon describes the myth as laughably false, adding, ""we use virtually every part of the brain, and that (most of) the brain is active almost all the time""."" In short: we use just as much as we need at any given time, no more no less.However, factual inaccuracies are the least problematic issue with Limitless. It is the main character that breaks the film. A nobody, with no obvious talent or desire to succeed gets a designer drug that gives him superhuman intelligence and, avoiding all the hard work that goes into succeeding in life - he climbs the social, financial and intellectual pyramid literally overnight. Up to this point we still sympathize with him because we know this course of action leads to an inevitable downfall, a price that has to be paid and a lesson to be learned. Yet that never happens - at the end the main character is still fundamentally unchanged, still a nobody without the drugs, which he has managed to refine so as to use them without repercussions. That is the core of this film, getting something for nothing - twice. The lesson learned? Cheat as much as you can, use people as much as possible, regardless of who gets hurt (several deaths occur indirectly or directly the responsibility of the main character) and you will be rewarded appropriately. Just don't get caught doing it.Truly, the main character makes the corporate sharks he associates with in the film look like honest, hard working individuals. In fact, even gangsters have it harder than this.At certain points the movie devolves into pure fantasy - a sequence where the main character fights several individuals by recalling knowledge from Bruce Lee movies and fighting video tutorials - as if memory had anything to do with skill gained by endless repetition.As for the rest, the performances are decent. There are a few nice camera tricks with continuous zooming in. The direction is competent, the movie itself watchable. The subtext however, renders it mediocre at best.",Limitless
331,nameesh,Very good to watch :),8,29 May 2011,"Loved the way movie was presented. It makes people to believe in the abilities each of us does possess from within. It could be shocking to utilize so much of the brain :)Movie has been paced very very well. And the best part is that it does not bore or surprise abit. Bradly Cooper was done an excellent job in the movie. Every other character seem to have revolved around the main character.Though the movie is a sci-fi, many things are very much believable. Its not just about a drug to improve the brains capacity, its about letting the inhibitions out and think what would be the best thing to do in a given situation. Many of us get into tangles and struggle to get out. If we get out the shell, v all can do a lot better :)1 person who seemed to hav been wasted is Robert Di Nero, im sure anyone could have done that job.

333,drigmy11,A good movie with some small flaws,8,9 June 2011,"Good movie overall and Bradley Cooper is a good actor in it. My main problem was the insertion into the story of the criminal thugs. If using 100% of his brain surely he would not miss the importance of needing to pay back this criminal fellow, particularly after being told what would happen if he did not. It's not like he didn't have loads of money by then, it was just made out that he forgot, where as throughout the rest of the movie he is drawing upon his memory to recall the smallest of details from his past in order to learn and improvise at a genius level.Anyway, this didn't stop me from enjoying the movie because I do actually think that the overall premise and delivery by Bradley was very good.",Limitless

Perchance, he is introduced to a new drug that opens up the limits of his mind. His misadventures take him through expected channels of fantasy, murder, pursuit and survival.The movie has many loose ends, especially on the murders that happen. It struggles at times to move forward logically from a scene to the next, but you will be willing to excuse the lapse as the story-line brings in the next twist of events. Bradley carries the movie on his shoulders pretty well, but it is a disappointment to see the talent of Robert DeNiro wasted in the movie. DeNiro does justice to the role given to him, but when you put an actor of his caliber in a movie, you expect more. The only scene where he inspired was close to the climax when he is Eddie's office. Personally, I liked the Russian antagonist, played by Englishman Andrew Howard, more impressive that the rest of the cast.With no real villains in it, but everyone dealing with a negative identity of their own, the movie does well to keep you entertained.7/10 - probably I may have given it an 8, if DeNiro's talent was better managed.",Limitless

For once I didn't see the ending to a movie coming. Not because it was some unpredictable twist ending, but because I was too encapsulated in the movie to care. The same thing happened to me with Neil Burger's The Illusionist, but this movie isn't a love story like The Illusionist was. It was very, very beautifully directed, though the zooming thing was a bit much to handle at times, but worst case, you close your eyes because you really won't miss anything but a really cool effect. I don't really want to spoil any of the really neat aspects, because I really liked them when I saw them and I don't want any of you expecting them.The plot had holes, as I'm sure plenty of people will point out, but when I was watching it, I didn't really care. I cared about the characters, and the story. As I said before, I didn't feel the need to contradict anything or look for contradictions or critique and nitpick because the story was interesting and so beautifully portrayed, both by the cinematography and by the acting. It mostly center around Bradley Cooper, and usually when movies only have one real main character it's very dangerous, but Cooper pulls off handling the spotlight perfectly and his character is so well written that you care for him, even though I couldn't personally relate to him (I've never been a drug addict turned super genius and I doubt many of you can say the same).I went into the movie expecting a fun movie that would be enjoyable, but have holes and was generally just overdone, and I came out shocked at how much I loved it.

It stays pretty light and doesn't delve deep into theme but at the same time touches on them enough to make you aware.This movie could have easily turned into a dark story about drug abuse or power and human limits, but instead takes a lighter approach I found refreshing.The ending I thought was great.

It has flaws, but it's a very fun ride. It's implausible, but it makes you think. I chose this movie because De Niro was in it, and I thought, ""If De Niro did it, it can't be all bad."" Brad Cooper plays a desperate slacker who's about to crash and burn. Then a drug dealer acquaintance offers him an untested drug that will help him. The movie is a little long, but Cooper's character runs through a maze of women, addiction, loan sharks, and various scenarios with charisma before climaxing into a violent confrontation with the loan shark, who wants more of the drug, and De Niro. It's a great roller coaster, and De Niro's big shot Donald Trumplike character makes it top notch.

It's sort of a high-tech medicine, but basically it's a drug: you feel great while you take it, but you get withdrawal pains if you stop. So, the moral: the drugs are bad, but you are stronger. You can kill two birds with one stone: get your brain working 100%, extend your mind, get to the next conscience level, whatever, and pay nothing for that.

I came in with very low expectations due to the horrible advertising but came out with a big smile and a feeling of satisfaction. The movie is very unique in every aspect. The dialog is comparable to The Social Network in intricacy and craftsmanship, the acting was great (not Oscar worthy but got the job done very well), Music/Sound was very enjoyable and unique, the cinematography/color palate was great but the editing stood out the most and will definitely be nominated for an Oscar. With the screenwriter having more freedom than most writers these days as well as her producing input, it aloud the movie to be well crafted and tastefully done rather than a Hollywood crap flick. It is definitely the best movie of the year so far, which isn't really saying much, but hopefully it sets the bar for even better films to come.",Limitless
343,viro-indovina,The antagonist should have been the main character,7,15 September 2011,"Given the excellent production values and acting talent on display, this movie was ultimately a disappointment to me. Its story is as empty of substance as the little clear pill, NZT. So what we are really being shown is a quest narrative, as the hero attempts to regain and hold onto a magic object that gives its owner ""limitless"" power without having to claim any responsibility for that privilege.Although we are presented with a character developing a serious drug addiction, this story doesn't give the audience any reason to care about what happens to him or the people around him. Unlike the many great screen addicts who have compelled us to watch their struggle, whom we have come to care about, or who have made us uneasy and upset, this movie's protagonist does not captivate the audience despite all his pharmaceutically induced super human powers that are meant to charm and distract us. By the end of the movie I was more interested in the antagonist, played by Robert DeNiro; the only character with any calculable arc, or any demonstrable depth. The best dialog in the movie comes almost as an aside, when DeNiro's character emotionally reveals himself to the protagonist, whom he describes as a petulant ""freak"". And at that point, agreeing with him, I was totally adrift, utterly unconcerned about the protagonist's ending despite the literal cliffhanger I was promised a resolution to at the movie's beginning. From that sun-drenched moment of illumination, beautifully shot in front of a Rothko painting, I was left with little else besides special effects, stunts, helicopter shots and life styles of the rich and famous set pieces; not much to contemplate or inspire.",Limitless

Oh My God , that was my first disposition , the movie starts with a bang, wonderful music being played as a background score and the protagonist starts narration, the progression keeps you enraptured and sometimes you find it difficult to blink an eye. Cooper has done an amazing job. I don't prefer watching science fiction movies because of nonsense infested in them generally, but this flick , let me tell you is not another science fiction, its a concoction of amazing screenplay, background score and thrilling scenes. My Companion 3 helped me to cherish this movie more but that doesn't diminutive its background score. Well nice editing,very simple plot weaved in to an interesting screenplay. Wonderful acting by Cooper, a great cameo kind role of Robert De Nero also motivated me to have a chance on this movie and you know what , you never regret watching De Nero, he justifies his role and needless to mention him because , the actor of his stature got to be excellent. In a nutshell watch this movie, you will not regret. I would not reveal anything about this movie, about the story , about subject, watch out yourself.

You are lured in by the awesome visual effects of the drug and can't miss one second of this movie, my eyes were instantly glues to the screen.

While I like to see amazing and unnatural things occur in movies, part of me isn't a fan of supernatural/magic stuff. Even Iron Man, which based the ""supernatural powers"" of Tony Stark on science and technology was a little ridiculous. Something like NZT-48 could probably be made using today's technology, although it clearly wouldn't be quite as awesome.Anyway, Limitless was an enjoyable ride from the very start of the movie to the very end. As some other reviewers have said, the concept of the Limitless storyline was fascinating but the execution was a bit flawed in some areas. The last chunk of the movie had some unnatural-feeling plot moves that probably could have been left out. This is why the movie isn't a 10 in my book, but I can gloss over some of the movies ""mistakes"" because the overall package was still great.There are some really trippy areas, specifically the parts where the camera ""walks"" dozens of blocks across New York City, that drew me into the awesome perspective of Eddie Morra (the main character)on NZT-48 too.

349,juan_ice,A Modern-Day Jack & the Beanstalk,6,15 August 2011,"The problem with making a movie about intelligence, is the lack of intelligence possessed by the people making the movie.A modern day version of the fairy tale Jack & the Beanstalk, the hero is given some ""beans"" by some stranger which he ""plants"" unthinkingly. The beans take him to a castle in the sky where unbelievable riches are simply lying around for the taking. Hold on though--there's a giant that wants nothing more than to grind his bones to make his bread!The parts that aren't inspired by the tale of Jack and his magic beans are the women in his life, and the anti-drug and moralistic themes that somehow lose their way as the film winds to a close. And these are what ruined the film.Eddie's ex and current girl both try the brain-boosting drug. The ex shows the terrible effects of taking too much brain food, but at the end, conveniently limps out of his life while dispensing words of wisdom on dosage and how now, he has to keep taking the pill ""or else you'll die!"" His girlfriend tries the drug, pulls off some running/parkour that would impress Will Smith and Tom Cruise, but feels that, even after having, what I am assuming is superintelligent sex, that the drug is ""bad."" Her reason? Because it's not really you doing these things. Lame. Why do the women always have to be typecast as voices of reason? Ghosts of Christmas Past rattling chains, yet at the same time, not really giving any actual lessons.The anti-drug message of the film, which is just that the pills have a downside: Take too much and you'll black out while fighting multiple dudes on a subway--and where all those seemingly wasted hours zoning out on action movies and youtube videos actually pays off, and you just might actually kill a supermodel. None of this hits home as the murder is never resolved, and you're taught that moderation is they key.The biggest downer, however, is the fact that by the end of the film, the message becomes that the benefits of having full use of your brain, still does not preclude acting like a total tool. Unimaginative writing propagates the already prevalent belief that above-average intelligence is really all about making loads of money quickly and getting a lot of punani.

From a druggie with health problems the guy miraculously became someone with a brilliant mind and no issues whatsoever. And it was not clear what was his motivation overall. Did he do all this stuff because he HAD to use all this new energy or he had some overall goal that was important for him? The movie fails to clarify this. Two things that were fun though. 1. Cooper is a good actor. It was fun how they used the color of his eyes to stress his ""condition"". 2. The girlfriend chasing scene where she has to take the drug to escape.

357,oshkosh_101,Unfocused and 2D Characters with Some Decent Parts,5,18 March 2011,"Limitless seems to be limited on conveying its purpose to the audience. The film wanders around unsure of where to go, but ends up being nothing special. It certainly had potential with its concept but ends up being a typical rise and fall movie of a drug addict where he sort of rises again at the end. The film is mostly a watered down version of the film Pi with some drug thrown in so it wouldn't cross the line of plagiarism. I really don't know why De Niro was cast in this film as his role could have been played by virtually any other decent actor. Yeah I said it. De Niro barely adds anything to this movie. Obviously, the only reason De Niro was in this was to increase the film's revenue.There really isn't much to say about the plot except that it's basically what you would except and nothing extremely surprising happens. I admit I was consistently paying attention throughout the movie and wasn't ever truly bored. However, this film is just so... bland. The only point of it seems to make a few bucks. Not to mention, the characters also seem rather indistinct and 2D with no notable performances. Very little development. The film's pacing is also quite slow. Despite having a rather typical running length it seems to go 1.5x as much as it actually is. They also throw in some random balding guy who just tries to kill Eddie and his girlfriend just so you wouldn't fall off from the edge of your seat from falling asleep. There's really nothing memorable about this movie with the exception of the somewhat intense confrontation scene towards the end, with those stereotypical Russian guys. However, there's one flaw with that scene. You WOULD THINK with such an extremely expensive security system there would be an alarm of any sort but nope. Even with NZT, he forgot to check if it came with an alarm. Writers of this movie: take some NZT or at least proofread your scripts.There are some questionable visual effects that seem to be there just for the sake of having them. Initially, I thought the drug's effect was seeing in a sepia tone and a wide angle lens. But seriously, was it really necessary to add random words that appear around the room as he is typing? Also, there's this godawful zoom in that appears a few times in the movie gave me a headache. I guess they're trying to be creative but it doesn't really work. Maybe I'm being too nitpicky on the effects, but theses ones are borderline artsy-fartsy or wankery without any taste. The soundtrack is also nothing noteworthy. From what I've heard, it just seems like your typical electronic music that will fit the mood but is just there for the sake of it.If you have nothing to do on a Friday night and you feel like you must see a movie just for the sake of seeing a movie, then by all means go see this one. Otherwise, I think my time is better spent watching De Niro in his prime instead of him just jumping into any film he can. Click ""not helpful"" on my review all you want, in a year or two the IMDb rating for this movie will plummet. The people who genuinely think this movie has a purpose besides mindless entertainment to it should pop some NZT in their mouth to be able to see why it isn't that good.",Limitless

This is one of those films that to enjoy you kind of have to just 'go with it' and not scrutinise it too heavily.Bradley Cooper is easy to watch, and a likable character, he plays a failing writer who changes his life after ingesting a new wonder drug.Robert De Niro takes a back seat with his role, and is fine but is not going to amaze anyone anytime soon I don't think, but in his defence he is an acting legend and can do what he likes!There are several aspects of this film which do bug me however, i'll mention just one:The main character murders a lady in a hotel room, manages to get away with it and there is nothing more said, and he returns to being the nice guy again! Either include this aspect of the story and deal with it properly or take it out would be my opinion.Others include the vague description of the drug and the idea that although everyone else who takes it eventually dies or becomes a shadow of their former self, Eddie Morra just has one bad hangover and then continues being the well polished super intelligent charmer, forever!But besides these and other discrepancies I mostly enjoyed the movie.

It's a credible idea, that there may be a drug that makes you ridiculously smart.Having a superhuman intellect and ability to ""connect the dots"" presents him with untold opportunities. I found the story for Eddie credible and engaging. Many tense moments where you wonder ""how the heck is he gonna get out of this"". If you've ever wished for a drug like this for yourself, then you should be able to relate to Eddie and Brad Cooper's performance of Eddie gels well with the audience in a credible way. This movie was well cast all round with Abbie Cornish, and Robert De Niro and Andrew Howard as ""Gennady"".This is not an action movie, but has a good number of scenes with action. The story's pace is good, I never got bored. I found that some questions weren't answered, but they do not affect the main plot. We may get those answers in the classic ""director's"" cut edition when this comes to DVD. The ending is good to... room for a sequel ?My recommendation. Must see!",Limitless
363,eddie_pedro,A good plot but underdeveloped characters,6,17 April 2011,"LimitlessDirector: Neil Burger (The Illusionist)The film begins with the writer Eddie (Bradley Cooper) being dumped by his girlfriend, this is quickly followed by various examples of how bad his life is: we find out that he is divorced; he is writing a book and can't get started; his apartment is a mess. This all changes after a chance encounter with his former brother in law, who (after a past of drug dealing) works for a pharmaceutical company and has a legal wonder drug which allows you access to the full capability of your brain. Eddie very quickly becomes very successful; however he finds that it's not easy being at the top.The role of Eddie is played by Bradley Cooper who has only really played the good looking cocky guy (in The Hangover and A-Team) but here he is playing both a loser (at the start) and then a confident successful businessman (later on). As the confident businessman he is perfect and very comfortable, but when playing the loser he looks unconvincing, and not really believable. The next biggest name (or maybe the biggest name depending on how you look at it) is Robert De Niro, who plays Eddie's eventual employer, who uses his talents to try to merge with another company. De Niro is very good but his character isn't, there is no depth, he is basically a one dimensional businessman. What I would have liked to have seen is De Niro trying to investigate why Eddie is so talented. The main problem with this film however is the lack of a good main villain, it has a good hero who is likable and a kind of everyman, but the main villain is some random loan shark who also gets hooked on the drug. The finale with this villain is good (although somewhat unbelievable) but there is no real intellectual threat to him, it is a major problem.There is also a lack of continuity, where Eddie (who is an intelligent man just not motivated) and the loan shark (who is not intelligent) and almost everyone else in the film gets addicted to the drug, when Eddie's on-again-off-again girlfriend takes it she is able to give it up without even so much as a struggle.In conclusion, this is an average film, which definitely gives up character depth for plot; however there are some good moments like the lighting: it is very dull when he is not on the drug and then brighter and more lively when he is on it, letting the viewer know what's going on. Overall: 6/10Best quote: Eddie Morra: I see every scenario, I see 50 scenarios, that's what it does Carl - it puts me 50 moves ahead of you.",Limitless

I actually found myself wishing this pill really did exist in real life. Watching this film, I felt that the struggles that the lead character faced were well displayed, from his writer's block to his girlfriend to his complete vulnerability as he faces the mysteries of this new-found power that he stumbled across. It was good to see how not everything worked out the way he expected it to. The big Flaw in this movie is this: if he can outsmart every stock market analyst after just a few days of studying, why can't he, himself, study the pill and find a way to reproduce it? Why leave this to the amateurs who are using only 35 percent of their brain ? The same holds true for fending off the bad guys: he should be able to out smart them or at least buy a gun with a silencer. He knows they are after him.

I did like Anna Friels characterisation well above her appearances in the GOAL films which were woeful.Robert de Niro was good too, isn't he always The camera effects were different, but eye-straining , maybe that's just me showing my age. For all the positives I found myself wanting to fast forward, some scenes were just stretched more than I needed. And yet I didn't like attempt at showing his induction to the elite circle in a video fast forward style. All in all there was something a bit grating about the high speed motion scenes I never felt that I could connect with the film, the fight scene was a case in point So OK, pretty good even, not one of those you would buy and watch again and again, and once I got flowers for algernon in my head it kind of went from being clever to not so clever.",Limitless

It plays into the human desire of wanting to be highly intelligent, knowledgeable and in turn successful. This movie exposes you to both the positives and negatives that come with great intelligence and great success, as you see contrasting characters, all experiencing higher intelligence than usual but this is not in depth, and you only really get a feel for Bradley Cooper's experience.For some parts of the movie, it feels as though, Bradley Cooper is the only actor in this movie, as it focuses primarily on him as he thrives and struggles with the dilemma on super intelligence, and his quest to get the pill which grants him this. But holds your interest throughout.I found the ending unpredictable, and it kept me on my toes throughout! Very enjoyable!For those, who don't enjoy movies where the camera filming moves and spans at speed, there are a few moments when you may feel sick or struggle to watch and need to look away, this is more in the beginning and shouldn't detract from your enjoyment of the movie.",Limitless

He finds that he has writer's block and spends most of his days meandering throughout his home and town. He stumbles onto his ex brother-in-law, Vernon, in town who reveals to him a new drug that he has been working on. NZT, as they call it, is a powerful drug that allows the user to access 100% of their brain potential, instead of the average 20%. Eddie takes the pill he received from Vernon and quickly felt the effects of the drug. His mind was open and he could see the whole world in front of him for the very first time. He rapidly recalled information he had read or heard about in the past, and was able to learn at an instantaneous rate. However, when he wakes up the next morning he realizes that the NZT has won off. The world around him is cloudy, and he craves more of the drug. He goes to meet up with Vernon and is asked to run some errands. When he returns he finds Vernon is dead. He quickly searches around the apartment and finds a pouch of NZT, some cash, and an address book. He returns home after talking to the police and being warned by Vernon's/Eddie's ex wife, to stay away from anything Vernon was involved with.Eddie uses the NZT to finish his book, and play the stock market. He quickly turns $100,000 into $2,000,000. A tycoon named Carl Van Loon, Robert Di Niro, asks Eddie to help him with the proposed merger with Hank Atwood, Richard Bekins. Eddie starts to have short-term memory loss and begins to get sick. He seeks out his ex wife to talk about NZT. He finds out that NZT has its side effects and quitting is worse. Eddie is blackmailed into giving Gennady, a wealthy man who previously loaned Eddie money while he was in the stock business, more NZT. Eddie learns that Atwood is in a coma, and people that work for him are looking for the NZT stash that Eddie has. Eddie resorts to buying a safe house that is broken into by Gennady and his men who are trying to kill him. Eddie gets out of the sticky situation and a year later is running for the United States Senate. He is greeted by Carl Van Loon who tells him that he knows about the NZT and has shut down Eddie's laboratories. Eddie reveals to him that he is no longer on NZT and that the effects are permanent. I find this movie to be very suspenseful and action packed. It has a lot of twists and turns and takes the viewer on a journey through the unknown. I would recommend this movie to anyone and everyone looking to be put on the edge of their seat.",Limitless

For example ""Surrogates"" is an excellent science fiction thriller and at the same time provides us with some IMHO very worthy thoughts and conclusions. The same can be said about ""Gattaca"" which is highly up-to-date though it was produced in 1997.Limitless (at first) seems to be an entertainment movie only but the final scenes go far beyond the scale of the previous events and turn the story into something more. Into something which can prove Limitless. A young man called Eddie Morra is (pretends to be) a writer. Naturally he has some book project in his head, naturally the project is one of genius, and he needs a mere trifle: some inspiration to put it down on paper.

It's an exiting and believable story about an ordinary guy who suddenly finds a way to get it all together. It's a story with which we can all identify.Imagine that you can suddenly figure out every situation and know how to react. Yet the main character is an outsider with no big connections. It's for real but a fantasy too.

It has so much potential: an intriguing and clever concept, superb actors, decent script, good direction, sensational visual effects and editing, so what happened? I can't help but feel there was a great story driven film in here at one time during development. However, somehow studio executives -- no doubt pandering to the teenage boy demographic -- just had to add in all the predictable car chases and shoot-em-up gratuitous action. In the end this action was irritatingly distracting from the very captivating storyline that I kept on wishing they would come back to - i.e what happens when one has unlimited cognitive capacity. This is the same flaw that marred Christopher Nolan's otherwise fascinating story in Inception.Note to studios and filmmakers why can't you be bold enough to just stick with the STORY?

The main character goes and insults an old guy with a faulty heart for god's sake, and the directors still attempt to make you happy for him for having all that money and power.

Telling you it promotes the use of drugs would make me a conservative bigot. If i tell you the elites using of occultism to reach the same power as the pills, it will make me a lunatic mystic. It seems in now way curious for most of the audience that the movie is portraying humanity as pathetic in its normal condition, and twisted on his unlimited condition - sure the potential depicted is all about intellect, power, money, security, paranoia, and even killing, lying, forgering, cheating in the sake of ultimate power. Never towards love the next one as your brother, evade, create, get mystical, consolidate knowledges, build something useful to the community, Oh yes sorry - I do remember now : those notions are so ass-blessed, boring, naive and uncool! This is the sad story of Hollywood now making you think that the most beautiful and useful things to your everyday life are... uncool. Movie after movie, depicting each one multiple murders, gratuitous violence, the art of faking and the permanent necessity of lying, Hollywood teaches its audience a new way to be cool : * smart -but talking with 500 words top, * megalomaniac -yourself is everything, * competitional -the other is nothing, * materialist -never see the why,the where,the essence (ans so on) All those things said, the choice of De Niro named ""Van"" something and as a mentor of Mora is plainly representing the deal made by old aristocracy to the uneducated newcomers that plunge into it (ie Clinton, Carter, and some other son of farmers that will learn how to rule the world without ascendancy). As I read it here in the comments, this a Faustian pact, and nobody could be better than De Niro who incarnated Louis Cyphre in Angel Heart.

380,EnamMallik,"If you thought it was fun, you're already smart without a pill",7,8 April 2011,"All right, I have seen The Illusionist (2006) from the same director and I really liked it. Limitless (2011) is definitely likable too but I would not say I really like it. The direction and the camera works were great which went on pretty well with the film, taking the viewers into the buzz by the ongoing zooming technique. It does a good job in getting us into the head of Bradley Cooper. Bradley Cooper did very well; gradually he is becoming a very promising actor. Robert De Niro, as we all know is always amazing, was good. Johnny Whitworth has the potential of delivering quality acting and should be given bigger roles in the future. All the other actors and actresses were okay, there is always room for improvement. The Cinematography was as good as in The Illusionist (2006). I felt the ending was not good enough. Was it a way of encouraging people to find and go for such a drug or any similar types of drug such as Yabba, which is already in the market. Get hold of it and you will be successful in life with the ability to do whatever you want, really? Considering the incredible capability of our brain, the story is realistic, but what would have made the ending better is that after Bradley Cooper gets another pack of those pills from the old guy's place, he starts being smart again and becomes the senator and so on. Relating to this part, at the ending, it could be shown that he was sitting in his apartment only thinking these incidents to be real as his brain got extremely focused to only what he would think. That would add better sense to it taking side effects into consideration. Tripping to the story line again, the murder of the woman at the hotel could have created suspense with confusions and could have contributed more and I wondered why there was not any investigation done? The tension in the scenes such as when Bradley Cooper after having the first pill goes to Johnny Whitworth's apartment and finds him dead and near the end when he sucks the flowing intoxicated blood and just lies there with a syringe inside his mouth to plunge into the eye of the one-eyed bodyguard, were done very professionally.

381,gazoot,A real success!,10,10 April 2015,"This is such a nice, fast-paced, modern style movie that makes almost everything right. Bradley Cooper is great, bringing his natural style into a half-failed author that goes through many stages of transformation after finding a way to unlock the full mental capacity of the brain.Add to that De Niro as a tough businessman and a career opportunity for the protagonist, and a scary, somewhat over-the-top Andrew Howard as the bad guy. The result is an excellent mix of clever dialogue and ""smart"" action thanks to the newfound limitless brain capacity. But the best thing is the way you'll get into the movie, if you allow yourself that. It's almost like you get a sense of ""this is doable!"" and afterwards you'll probably feel like taking a memory course and start organizing your life!What I also like is the main characters upcoming sense of a higher purpose. Life and potential should not be wasted, seems to be the message that director Neil Burger wants to send us.Let's not forget the soundtrack! The OST is perfect, with Ash Grunwald's ""Walking"" and The Black Keys ""Howlin' for you"" as highlights.

The idea that we use only a small percentage of our brains at any given time is total BS. But the concept tries to go one step further and convince the audience that this drug allows 100 percent use of the brain at all times for nothing more than cognitive thinking.If that were the case, how was the subject moving his body, keeping his respiration up, his heart beating? There's more to brain activity than thinking. It does perform other functions, you know.Secondly, if this movie had been realistic, Eddie's wonder drug pill wouldn't have simply made him smarter, clearer, motivated and confident, it would have left him crippled by all the sensory overload.Thirdly: How does a writer possess the ability to form a character who is super smart when the screen writer himself is a total moron? This being obvious from all the embarrassing plot holes and supposed ""smart"" things that Eddie does the entire movie? Like not pay back the dangerous loan shark after making 2 million from the 100k he borrowed. Buying himself an expensive fortress that did about as much good for him as holing up inside a cardboard box. Doubling up on a still untested drug before even understanding its side effects?And LASTLY, how can anyone create a script about drug abuse where the abuser walks away from it pretty much unscathed, getting all the things he wants in the end, and getting away with murder?! The whole murder thing that even Eddie himself was unsure as to whether or not he was guilty of was given a nod to but then shoved away to make room for more plot-driven devices that displayed more of Eddie's stupidity. Rather than solve these unanswered questions, it just shoots ahead 12 months where Eddie is running for president with a very strong chance to win when there's still this witness out there who claims Eddie murdered that woman. In what universe do murder suspects who never actually come around to defending themselves ever get elected senator or president?I went into this expecting everything about NZT to be this incredible wonder drug with horrifying consequences that would unsettle me down to my core. While I see the writer TRIED to take it to a dark place, ultimately, he caved to the squeaky clean Hollywood happy ending, and everyone watching the movie walked out wishing they could take NZT and become super human.

It's a story of a man with four digits IQ but initially an ordinary book writer Edward ""Eddie"" Morra (Bradley Cooper), do not have any story to write, waiting for an idea but still have a pretty girlfriend Lindy. So story starts in flashback where he met brother of his ex-wife who insisted him to take a drug , a stimulating drug which allow people to access 100% of their brain's power(as it is said that we, a normal human use only 20% of his brain power. dkexplorer.blogspot.com",Limitless
391,alfepor,Value judgment,5,16 October 2013,"When I watched this movie I couldn't disagree more with what it seems the writers think it means to be, let alone very, but extraordinarily intelligent.Eddie Morra is a frustrated writer, then he gets a pill that makes him super intelligent, so he can write a number of novels that immediately go award winning and are compared to the greatest works of literature.Then, out of the blue, Mr Morra decides that he doesn't want to be a writer anymore, so he becomes a high risk investor. As you have probably read in other reviews -or if you have watched the movie-, Mr Morra gets in trouble with the Mafia and so on, but that's not my point.My point is that according to the movie a super intelligent person is that that becomes a businessman, not a philosopher, not a scientific, etc. Get the Idea? Is this movie trying to tell us that intelligent people are that which own half of the world and do so because they became rich in a 'clever' but dishonest way? To me Mr Morra was far more intelligent before he took the pill and was just a writer -before he became just another business man who doesn't make the world a better place but the other way around.",Limitless

Oh yea, and I would not think of ""how do I make this drug?"" until I was in a stupid state; WTF- he had to be off the drug to think of that? There was not even the slightest hint that he would use his super intelligence to better mankind. I do not know about most people, but things like this made me think the movie to be totally stupid and child like...very ridiculous. And if someone can quintuple their money four days in a row,WHY ONE EARTH would he need to borrow $100,000? I believe he said ""quintuple every day for the last 4 days"". Let me see, starting out with $800, would that not put him right at $100,000 already? WHY! on earth would he need to borrow money from the mob. And if he did borrow it and was super smart, why would he then not repay the loan on time. (kind of stupid don't you think) This makes no sense what so ever.",Limitless
393,kulak4,"""God on crack""",7,9 August 2012,"The newest Neil Burger's flick (the director of 'The Illusionist') entering the cinemas under the cryptic title ""Limitless"" is a fast-paced action movie. Bradley Cooper (nowadays extremely sought-after in Hollywood), the typical handsome-looking guy, plays first fiddle in the aforesaid film. Somewhere in the background there is a place for Robert DeNiro himself; however, it's rather a bit part. Despite the recognizable and appreciated names in the cast, has ""Limitless"" got other assets capable of pulling in the audience? The whole ruse evokes around a specific kind of drug allowing its user to unleash the latent powers of one's brain. One day, Eddie Mora, a writer struggling with the writer's block, faces a one-in-a-lifetime opportunity to use a remedy in a form of a little, inconspicuous pellet. Eventually, the main protagonist reaches for the mysterious medicament, which causes a spate of unprecedented events. Thanks to this little handicap, Eddie boasts of 4-digit intelligence quotient, all of the mundane problems turn out to be insultingly simple. Foreign language learning, book writing, playing the market - for a genius, all of these activities are of no more effort than breathing. The real problem occurs when Mora starts to draw the excessive attention to himself and the number of pills required to work at the full blast declines dramatically with every day passing by...'Limitless' is a motion picture based on an interesting idea. The main theme had great potential; unfortunately, it has been put into frames of a considerably shallow plot. As far as the script is concerned, the movie does not abound with surprising turns of events (although it starts with attention-gripping retrospective opening sequence). Moreover, the scenario is full of holes and striking disjunctions (if Eddie had 4-digit IQ, how come he mingled himself in such predicaments?). The schematic plot can easily be put aside due to the fact that the tempo of the course of events is maintained at appropriate level. During the screening of 'Limitless', the audience has no opportunity to yawn out of boredom. The story has been conducted with so dynamically that even sheer plot holes do not affect the reception of the movie. The director adjusts the tension very skilfully; therefore, the account of a drug-addict brainiac is simply engaging.Standing ovation goes to the director himself for attempting at experimenting with the montage of particular scenes. The decision to put an emphasis on peculiar, slightly psychedelic sequences (e.g. after the first dose of the drug) has definitely worked in advantage of the quality of the whole picture, successfully increasing the visual value of the film (although the scene with the words popping up on the screen is reminiscent of the kitsch straight from '80). Not seldom does Burger employs interesting camera-zooms complemented with the sequences of the objective going straight through the elements of the surroundings (e.g. window shield). All the tricks mentioned above serve not solely to make the reception of the movie visually more attractive, but also to kick up the dynamic of the flick.The cast does its job (above the average). Copper needs to be good-looking in the first place; however, his performance is not bad. The fact that his role does not require too much effort is a different matter...Robert De Niro on the other hand was hired presumably mainly for the promotional reasons because his role, albeit quite important for the whole movie, does not give this actor too much of a chance to deliver a spectacular performance.'Limitless"" is a movie of an underdeveloped potential. In some moments of the flick, it would be highly advisable to implement more explicit scenes and put the whole picture in a frame of a psychological thriller. In this case however, we have received a typical, flattened Hollywood-like story based on well delivered yet schematic plot. What is the biggest asset of Burger's movie is the lightness of the whole ruse and the way its plated into a headlong running action. The pace of the movie together with its interesting audio-visual side form an ostentatious, high-budget action flick. Without profound pondering as well as without a feeling of wasted time. I recommend 'Limitless"" as a good entertainment.The telegraphic shortcut: stoned (and thereby genial) Cooper in an action flick conveying a pseudo-message; impressive montage and engaging turn of events let the audience forget about the wasted potential of the story. For good measure, there is Robert De Niro dutifully doing his bit part.",Limitless

Hell, he even endangers his girlfriend's life when he sends her to get his drugs (that he hid in her own house). What an asshole!Van Loom, his boss is insanely stupid. He learns about the drug and even buys the manufacturers of the substance so why doesn't he use it himself? He manufactures it now and says he has limitless supply so he shouldn't be concerned about running out and ending dead (even thought we learn he'll die in a couple of months so it's kinda pointless). And even if he just doesn't like the idea of being on drugs, can't he just take the drug once and find a way to become super smart without it? (JUST LIKE THE PROTAGONIST)The protagonist's brother-in-law, who gave the drug to our protagonist to begin with also proves this point. I'm curious - how did this guy ever die? When Edward finds his dead in his apartment, with his body riddled with bullets, he also finds a bag full of this powerful drug hidden in the oven. Couldn't he have just taken one pill and, like, come up with a thousand ways to avoid getting killed?Apparently it doesn't matter if you're a criminal or really poor. If you get really smart, you can always end up a millionaire.So Edward finds a way to keep his super smart brain without having to take the drug anymore?

Bradley Cooper is doing a mediocre performance in this action-drama-thriller-esque film. The movie, after briefly telling about some facts about how the brain works, continue on with a thin plot and a repeating story, with no interesting character development or any plot twists that keep you interested. The script is downright boring hard to believe to the slightest degree, with some few exceptions. Mediocre at best, the movie continues down a straight line that ends not only making you feel disappointed, but that you've also wasted 1 hr 49 min that you could have used to watch a meaningful or provocative movie instead. Watch it if you're looking for some entertainment, but please, don't expect either a good script or good performances from either Bradley Cooper and Robert De Niro (latter which single handedly saves this movie from being utter garbage while not actually doing that good of a performance himself).Tl;dr: Expect nothing and get nothing.

396,TheCriticalWarhead,Limitless is Decent even though Limited,7,29 April 2013,"Limitless is a Bradley Cooper vehicle that spends its time with interesting high energy cinematography, editing and directing. But I felt the story left more of a central question to the viewer rather than answers to the overall plot.The plot of the movie is that this down on his luck writer named Eddie (Bradley Cooper) just got dumped by his girlfriend and surprise, surprise has writer's block on his recent book that he is writing. By sheer coincidence he meets his ex-brother-in-law who happens to be a supplier of a new drug street-named NZT, and this essentially grants him the power of super enhanced focus and the ability to learn information at an astonishing pace. One thing leads to another and he gets in trouble with the mob, his work and his personal life.Now the pieces I think really worked in this film are the interestingly high paced production values of the film, I think it's engaging but I believe that someone will find it very uninteresting, subjectively speaking of course. Another thing I enjoyed was the performances, I thought Bradley Cooper does show he has charisma and charm that can carry a film and of course Robert De Niro is just Robert De Niro.My problems in the film come from inconsistencies in the overall plot of the film. There are some plot holes, but I think this film is enjoyable enough to skim past them. I also dislike the typical Hollywood ending this film gives which really just leaves more questions than answers. Also I swear Bradley Cooper gets laid in like every 3 scenes which is more nitpicking because it is Bradley Cooper, but still. But my whole mind throughout the film was asking me would I do the drug even knowing the side effects of it, and I say hell yeah, but seriously that really is the central question the film leaves you with. Overall I think it's a fun little popcorn flick if your bored, I think if you watch it with low expectations the film will be better than you expect it to be. I'm going to give it a solid 7/10 because I did enjoy myself watching it, even though I don't think it will be for everybody.-The Critical Warhead",Limitless

398,mlcamilli,One of the worst movies I've ever seen,2,8 November 2014,"This movie made no sense. It's pretty risky writing a script about someone who becomes super-intelligent if you are not. If this guy was super-intelligent, wouldn't he have known how stupid it was to take this drug? So it gives you book smarts but not common sense? Why in the subway did he remember all these awesome martial arts moves, but forget them in his own apartment? Do you need to be super-intelligent to know you should wash your hair and clean up your apartment? Whose hands were they? Why was the Russian loan shark after him if he'd paid him back? The Russian obviously had his own supply of the drug (how? He didn't even know what he had been given). Also, the guy should get his 8 Mil back for the apartment if it could be broken into so easily. And with knowing how dangerous the drug was (was it really, if all it took was to make sure you ate enough and didn't drink alcohol to make sure you had no side effects? Didn't any of the other people figure this out if they were so smart?), why would he tell his girl friend to take it? Why didn't she get hooked? There are so many things that don't make sense. Who did kill that girl? Why no more mention of the side effects? It was a great plot point then swept under the rug. Also, if he's super smart, wouldn't he know better than to hand his jacket, full of his only drug supply, to some other guy to hold? Hidden pocket or not, you can tell when you're holding someone's jacket if there's some bag of something in it. Chances are the police might have searched it anyway. Oh, and - first, authors normally do not deal directly with publishers, they have agents. Also, unless this guy was a famous, oft-published author he NEVER would have some kind of deal or advance for a book that's not even written yet.The only enjoyment I got out of watching this movie was making fun of it.

If a normal person created the drug, there is no doubt he should be able to figure out what the drug consists of and how to make it in record time, especially once he has the means (money) to buy the equipment and whatever he needs to test/create it. Secondly, by the end of the movie, you would think he would buy a gun or two for protection since there are goons constantly coming after him to hurt or kill him.

The idea behind the story was intriguing. The acting and the editing were good. The visuals were great, fitting very well with the emotions and events in the story. There were also some cool fractal zoom effects.Some notable negative points with the story:SPOILERS!If Eddie was quintupling his money every day and winning in card games, he could earn enough in a few days to not need a loan from the Russians. This makes the subplot with the Russians contrived.It was never revealed who leaked the info about the merge, which gives the impression something potentially important is unanswered. (It is explained in the book it's based on as happening due to van Loon calling some people to cancel appointments, mentioning Atwood. From this, rumours started.)The character who worked for Atwood, who chased Eddie and his girlfriend for the NZT and casually killed some people in the park, was never explained and thus seemed unrealistic and unnecessary. How did he find Eddie? How did he know the girlfriend had the stash?The subplot about Atwood stealing Eddie's stash via his lawyer was based on far-out coincidences that Atwood couldn't predict.Eddie couldn't have gotten a full dose from drinking the Russian's blood, even if he drank all he could realistically drink in the given situation. The effects should therefore have been significantly weaker. The story made no point of this though.An ingested drug would take at least 15 minutes to work, not 30 s.SPOILERS END.Nevertheless, the movie was very enjoyable still.

Let's go with my wife.The film, which is 1 hour and 45 minutes long, was viewed in one go. The film is based on the book by Alan Glynn 'The Dark Fields', so the name of the film (Limitless) localizers decided to translate as 'Areas of Darkness'. Although, in fact, the film is called 'Limitless' and there are no areas of darkness in the film at all.The plot of the film revolves around a new super pill that activates the entire brain into work, and the person who ate it becomes smart as Wasserman. Well, of course, according to the laws of the genre, it is swallowed by a writer of a bum-like appearance and immediately, as they say, falls into the stream and everything goes uphill. But it was not there! The pill has a side effect...The film was shot just fine. The special effects associated with improving the brain activity of the hero are beyond praise. Somehow, you're getting smarter yourself.Robert de Niro's role is quite small, but quite colorful. He is, so to speak, the decoration of the film.

The characters were well written and thought-out. The situations were too close to home for me to ignore. The character driven story was exemplary to any current sci-fi films.The tension was akin to any good crime drama but the plot kept it teasingly interesting. Why didn't I hear of this book?

420,lcofeer4,Where is the limit to our subconscious mind?,7,21 March 2011,"The movie starts as a 'what if' story, turns into a mystery, and then transforms itself into a thriller.The most interesting aspect of the film to me was its theme, namely the limitless potential of our conscious mind. Is our brain a treasure island full of hidden mental powers? At times we surprise ourselves by being able to recall a seemingly obscure fact deep in our memory vault.Not a few things in the movie kept me on the edge of my seat: the known/unknown side effects of the drug, the shady haunting man, the powerful secret hanging by a thread, and the unpredictable story line.The film slightly suffers from some loose ends, though. For example, it could do without the thug, and the murder at the hotel could have contributed better to the story line, if more elaborated.I wish that the ingredients of the drug were rare and the drug itself was impossible to be recreated.Overall, the acting was convincing and the special effects weren't distracting, but rather cleverly woven into the scenes.Its ending was rather lame, IMHO. Why not leave us with some unanswered questions to lose sleep over?

Neil shot this film in a such a captivating way that I never was pulled away from the story line. Visually, very compelling. The story arc took a few turns that I didn't completely expect and I absolutely loved the ending. Bradley Cooper became Eddie Morra in this movie - completely bought in to the character's transformation. My only beef would be that with it's PG13 rating. I wonder if the intensity could have been turned up to 11 to really shake the audience; I do understand having it PG13 was a business decision and one that I hope proves successful.

There are some cool visual and special effects throughout, good editing, creative directing, and cinematography that could be nominated honestly.

425,Robina_Review,Pleasantly Surprised,7,9 March 2011,"I realize the full release for this film is 2 days away, so this review can't go into any specifics or great detail (don't want to give anything away). Walking into the theater, I didn't have any lofty expectations. There's a delicate balance with adding futuristic technology and/or sci-fi to a modern day setting. Many movies take it to a level so unrealistic it just gets silly and ruins the plot (e.g. Eagle Eye). However, Limitless focuses more on the characters and theme to carry the film. Bradley Cooper is very convincing in the beginning as the ""before"" version of himself, and you find yourself routing for him in an old fashioned good vs evil way, without him being the perfect prince charming type. Each character has the ""everday person"" layers which keeps the movie grounded enough to watch it as if it was really possible to be in those situations. In the end, you'll be asking yourself just that, ""What would I do in that situation?"" There's a couple holes left open in the theory of ""the pill"" and with what could/would really happen if it was real life, but I guess that would be expected in a movie about a fictional technology. Overall, Recommended - A good 7 out of 10.",Limitless
426,deborapr87,Definitely a fun movie!,8,11 March 2011,"If you've ever found yourself staring into nothingness, wondering why you couldn't muster even a hair of energy to get up and do something, then you're going to find this movie highly satisfying. Limitless takes you on a ride... and that's not an exaggeration. The computer graphics create a glimpse into what it would actually feel like to be a ""super-you."" The writers also did a great job of creating a character that from the start... pretty much charms your pants off. Bradley Cooper actually surprised me. I never thought he was a bad actor, but he was able to honestly portray a guy that had absolutely nothing going for him and became a ""somebody."" The movie graphics, plot, and main actors (well, DeNiro, Cooper, and Johnny Whitworth) were all intriguing. It's not just a movie about what crazy things some drug can make you do... it creates a discussion within each of us, ""What if you could unlock all the potential of YOUR mind, who would you be?"" Now the downsides... some of the supporting actors were very weak. Also, there were some scenarios that went off the deep end but actually had the audience laughing hysterically so it wasn't exactly a bad thing. If you thought you'd get a deep or scientific explanation for the drug... don't hold your breath. Thankfully the plot was engaging enough that you didn't really care. The movie had some interesting ideas but some that I especially loved were the ones about identity, and about taking something to make yourself better and whether that meant you were actually you or an altered you. Does it matter even? One last thing I gotta say though, the one guy, Johnny Whitworth, did a really great job. I hope he gets some major roles in the future because I think he's very talented. I'd definitely recommend watching this movie. If only just for the ridiculous scene with the skates. Hilarious.",Limitless
427,scottlawlor73,Cooper has no Limit,6,17 March 2011,"Limitless, directed by Neil Burger (The Illusionist) and adapted from a novel by Alan Glyn, is a story of a 30 something failed writer played by the annoyingly handsome Bradley Cooper (A-Team). Going nowhere fast with his life, dumped by his longtime girlfriend, happens to bump into an old friend who introduces him to a drug that can unlock the brains full potential. Unfortunately for our hero all this power comes with a price, without the drug you are back worse than where you were when you started. Tracked by a group of killers Cooper's character must find out more of this drugs shadowy origin.We start with Cooper on a sky scraper (I have a theme here). He is about to jump off. End it all, and in true Hollywood fashion we are then thrown back to where it all began.If I was to sum the movie up in a comparison, it is like Crank meets Wall Street meets the smack my b**ch up video (Prodigy). It was very silly in parts which I quite enjoy in films. We can't always see things that make us ponder the essence of our existence. One scene where desperate for the drug Cooper sucks up the blood of a dead villain just made me groan with despair. In fact the final twenty minutes were pointless and didn't really need to be in the final cut.Bradley Cooper I generally like but some of his natural charm he showed in The Hangover and A Team didn't seem to be apparent here. Robert De Niro's role in this movie almost felt like a cameo, apart from one good classic De Niro monologue he didn't have a great impact on the show. The directors use an infinite zoom type shot which was very clever, I haven't seen that done very much before and did give a sense of despair when Coopers character is starting to lose time on the drug. Unfortunately this clever shot is used far too often and ended up making me feel sick and have to turn away from the screen.All in all Limitless is fun. Nothing special, but fun. A nice concept that makes you wonder how many high fliers are using such an enhancement to achieve almost non human goals. It is never going to win an Oscar, but hey, who cares fun is good sometimes!!",Limitless

It didn't get bogged down in techno-babble or hi-technology scenes. Others have given detailed write-ups already, but I will just say that the very last line of the movie that WASN'T said left me wanting for it.

432,Montzz,Almost Limitless,7,8 April 2011,"Limitless, in a nutshell, is the story of a struggling writer/slacker who stumbles upon a drug that causes him use his brain to its full thinking potential- and like any other drug, he has to deal with the consequences that come from over-use and the dangers of the black market.As a whole, the best word to describe this movie would be unique- although the ""super-human"" concept has been used over and over again in the creative circuit, this story puts a new twist and spin on this idea that sparks a retrospective glance of the drug-fueled cultural revolution of the 60s- the idea that there is some kind of drug out there that unlocks your true potential.Not only is the story quite unique, but the filming style is in a world of its own, with the bizarre fractals and endless zooming sequences making you feel that you are almost on a drug yourself.The writing style and acting in this movie is superb- Bradley Cooper does a superb job narrating the story and acting the main part, and Robert DeNiro reprises his arguably overused (with good reason), but well-fitting role of a corporate elitist who doesn't give a damn. The story as a whole, however, is where Limitless seems to not work as a pun.The story is somewhat slow to get started, and though excitement and wonder follow once things get started, the movie takes the direction of going through a few different story arcs that really seem as though they could have been written better. The ending, although one that ties all the loose-ends, fails to offer the satisfaction that the story arcs seem to be building towards throughout the movie. Whether or not this was intended as a further metaphoric example of drug culture is arguable at best, but the fact remains that I left the theater wanting something a little more.All in all, Limitless is like a roller-coaster ride- it is fast, fun, exciting and unique, but this roller-coaster had potential to have been better-designed and executed. None-the-less, it was a great ride, and a it's a definite recommendation if you are looking for a good time.",Limitless

435,anthony-33-902651,Limitless review by Ruben Scherrer,7,21 April 2011,"The plot is based on a not very well-known novel by Alan Glynn called 'The Dark Fields'. It's about a writer who meets his ex-wife's brother who then gives him a pill. He doesn't know what the effect of the pill will be. Because of the drug his brain power improves to 100% and so he becomes probably the most intelligent man in the world. As you can imagine, it gets really exciting and thrilling for him but he also gets into trouble with his new ability.This film is really absorbing and progresses at an extremely fast tempo. The actor Bradley Cooper in the main role does it well but I don't think he could really identify with the role of a super intelligent banker and writer. There is a new special effect that is really special and one I've never seen before: it's a kind of twisting zoom that goes on for a long time without any hesitation. I really liked this effect and how it was used in the movie.In conclusion, I enjoyed and would like to watch more movies by Neil Burger. Finally, I would recommend this movie to anyone who likes modern action or sci-fi movies because it has a nice story and some really fascinating new video effects. Good work!",Limitless

This enables him to pick up his broken life and take it to new heights. However he soon discovers that something so amazing cannot come without a price.

This is a Bradley Cooper movie with Deniro having a fairly small part in the movie. The basic concept is that the slacker-Cooper takes a pill that allows him to access his entire brain to do all sorts of things. He is a writer with writers block. One magical pill and he finishes his book in a few days. The next thing you know he is picking stocks. The initial premise is that we has a powerful memory etc. He has no background in the financial world so for me that didn't make sense to me. The acting was fine by Cooper. I am a big Deniro fan but I think he came in and did some scenes for a few days and that was it. The movie is entertaining but as most these days will you remember it a few weeks later.

446,gwbraders,Good film; appalling ending...,1,29 June 2013,"This film has so much potential, so much potential; yet unfortunately it falls well below the expected line. The ubiquitous Bradley Cooper plays the role of a slob who takes a pill that transforms his mental capabilities and allows him to glory his genius by making big money on the stock market. Of course there is a beautiful woman, Abby Cornish, with whom Cooper has a relationship. This fairly generic formula for the super-hero, flamboyant, flirtatious, protagonist offsets the genuinely inspired plot of the film. The film, in its essence, turns our estimation of drugs on its head. Of course drugs are reprehensible when they lead to decay; yet here they stimulate growth and opulence and thus the limitless drugs are not so much seen as the addictive agent that they are, rather the perpetrator of prosperity which, upon first evaluation, they are.Unfortunately, despite Cooper's becoming of an analytical machine, there are many fundamental flaws in his logic: firstly, why, upon taking this drug in which there were unknown substances, would Cooper's immediate reaction not be the ruthless stride to comprehend the essence of the drug and subsequently better it so as to ensure his future prosperity?; secondly, why does Cooper not separate the pills into multiple bags so as best to avoid their potential loss?; thirdly, would it not seem rational to correctly check the tin in which he keeps the pills to completely remove the risk of their being a remaining one... It does not take a genius to observe these fundamental flaws!!Subsequently the loan shark Gennady, who also does not know the components of NZT, take the risk of distilling the pill? It seems nonsensical for someone of absolute logic to take such simple risks; furthermore why did he not correctly analyse the room in which he is killed? Surely he should have noticed the knife as a major threat and sought to remove it from the near-grasp of Cooper?I end quickly by writing that the ending is appalling. The film in itself is not that bad, unfortunately the ending is not up to par and gives a sense of incompleteness to the film. Its like turning over onto the final page of a thriller novel, and reading the line: 'and they all lived happily ever after for the rest of their days'.Idea: brilliant. Execution: awful.",Limitless

449,MohammedMagdi,Time Out says,7,9 September 2013,"Do you like to leave the cinema feeling like someone's been slagging you off from the back row? Then 'Limitless' could be for you. It's a colourful, brutally nihilistic takedown of all the things most of us hold sacred (love, art, religion, politics) and some of the things we don't (pharmaceuticals, economics and those who work in pharmaceuticals and economics). Bradley Cooper excels as Eddie Morra, an obsessive character with a million-dollar smile who we meet as an under-motivated New York author and leave as a politician running for high office. In the interim, we chart his addiction to a clear, shirt-button-like pill that harnesses the full power of the brain, turning him from a greasy schlub into a chiselled, all-conquering super-brain. But at what price? If you think this sounds too 'Twilight Zone', then you're in for a surprise, as 'Limitless', based on Alan Glynn's 2001 novel 'The Dark Fields', feels no need for wanton moralising. Instead it bludgeons its victims one by one and leaves a trail of beautiful corpses in its wake. It's scatty and fast paced, and director Neil Burger employs some Gaspar Noé-style, bad-trip CG effects to heighten the mood. But the main reason the film is so successful and distinctive is that its satire pulls no punches: corporate tycoons are corrupt, unfeeling bastards, but will they really get their comeuppance? And rampant self-medicating of untested drugs can prompt paranoid, murderous urges, but at the end of the day, is that really such a bad thing for society?",Limitless

One of the reasons which involved my watching this film was how human brains can amazingly work with simple one tablet of drug. How much amazing things can be created. And if it exist in real life how great stuff could be done. But... Every great breakthrough has its own drawbacks. Not everyone wants it to use for good purpose. So in this movie you could deeply think of good and bad sides of drugs like making your brains work 100%. Of course all these action movies has its own love stories which makes film sweeter. Enjoy watching. Hope it will become one of best your ever seen movies like mine. Cheers.,Limitless
451,sjabbo,Incredibly shallow,1,21 August 2011,"Where to begin with this movie? The concept is interesting enough (super drug that enables all our human powers), but the execution of that idea in this movie was a total disaster.It's an incredibly shallow story, where our main guy works his way up in the system by writing a great book whilst on these magic pills, gets involved with a silly loan shark at some point, who for some reason seem to haunt him throughout the movie. His girlfriend is involved also, and is hunted down by a man who is constantly following our protagonist, and in what is one of the movie's absolutely dumbest scenes, said girlfriend manages to escape from this guy by making a run for it (having hidden from her follower behind some trees for some time, nobody knows exactly why the follower knew she was hiding behind those 4-5 trees, he's waiting there for her for a long time, instead of simply looking behind the trees, something you would do if you suspected someone you were looking for hiding there), using a kid on skates to slash this guy down in an ice-skating rink.Later on our man manages to achieve success and the American Dream is complete (of course). The conversations in the movie are shallow very Hollywood-esque, easy to swallow, but it doesn't really seem real.In exploring an idea that could be very interesting, the movie doesn't really deal with or manages to show the different facets of how a brain on this drug could in fact function. We basically just see a person who is ""good"" at performing whatever it is he does (and the visuals of the movie sharpens or ""lights up"" every time he takes one of the pills), in this case, investing money and writing, and ultimately, archieves his goal - by staying on these pills. But there's no in-depth exploration of the idea, just a shallow American Dream-story, that we've seen so many times before, but a lot better told than this.",Limitless
452,poeticlove856,Holy Moly...this movie was AWE-SOME!,10,1 February 2014,"So I am sitting at home bored to death. Just one of those dreary winter days in NJ. My girlfriend and I are on the blitz(again)so I was kind of in a stale mood. Flipping through the channels and stumbled on this movie. BEST MOVIE I HAVE SEEN IN A LONG TIME! It just pulled you. BC did a great job. It was almost like I was living out the role myself. I wondered what would happen if I took one of those little translucent pills. The mere fact that they didn't make the pill red,orange,green or blue was AWESOME! They made it clear.....CLEAR! Like water. How could something so powerful be so.....CLEAR...No color...no hype. OK so anyway whoever wrote the story is a freaking genius! There were so many twist and turns...that I was dizzy with anticipation. That pill was so powerful that it had a Russian dude blow torching a steel door open. A steel door! WOW. He needed a hit bad. So how about the part where he drank dudes blood....WHAT? Nasty but it spoke volumes. It said ""OK I just killed this guy and not only that...I need that pill in my body so bad...I'll have a few sips of his warm DEAD blood"" OK so I am rambling. Great movie but the ending could of been a little better. Still give it a 10!",Limitless
453,ayush-sekhari,Limitless thrill! Limitless fun!,8,18 August 2014,"Based on the novel ""The Dark Fields"" by Alan Glynn, Limitless is an American thriller film about an aspiring author Eddie Morra(Bradley Cooper) whose life changes in a couple of minutes when an old friend introduces him to NZT, a new pharmaceutical drug which allows him to access full potential of his brain. Everything Eddie has heard, read or seen suddenly becomes available and organized to him, making him the smartest and most active person in the world. Soon, he rises to the top of the financial world and draws the attention of the business tycoon Carl Van loon, who sees him as a tool to make billions, and invites him to help broker the biggest merger in the corporate history. After consuming NZT for some time, he begins to realize the hazards and what it has done to other consumers. Addicted to NZT, he finds himself trapped among mysterious strangers, a vicious gangster and an intense police investigation.The story revolves around how he fights them to keep his dwindling stash of NZT whose intake has now become necessary for his survival. The ending of the movie was very smooth leaving no open threads. Neil Burger(Director) has used various visual effects and camera angles to illustrate the effects of this powerful drug, the most interesting of which was fractal zoom used multiple times in the movie. Cooper very gracefully played the roles of both the super-active and the lazy, thus adding life to the character of Eddie. The plot of the movie unfolded respecting the temporal sequence of events. The movie is shot in a modern set-up. The composition was very good.",Limitless

But I will say that it's a great little SF film. Well thought out, though there are a couple of plot clangers that hurt a bit.I don't understand why this film got bucketed so much when it came out - I'd quite happily keep a copy on the shelf. It's certainly not embarrassing (anyone seen Lucy?? Similar concept, but not the same, and done by complete drooling idiots).I really like Limitless, it's gripping, intelligent and stylish. The parts of the story that are there purely for plot, and don't make a huge amount of sense, don't spoil it - it bounces back from them.Haters gonna hate, but I don't have to listen to them.Limitless rocks.",Limitless

The film does contain strong graphic scenes and language at times, but does not detract from the impact that the storyline has on one's psyche. Be warned - this film will leave you realizing just how easily we fall victim to substance abuse and the influence of power. Sometimes we seem to grasp at straws in order to make some sense of our lives - it would be fantastic to have an ""assistant"" like this - just to help us focus. But will we apply our new found focus and intellect to the betterment of mankind? The film will also peak the curiosity in the domain of experimental drugs and the ethics involved in testing these on humans.",Limitless
456,kidusmoges26,Great movie with versatile diversity.,8,10 December 2014,"LIMITLESS I really like limitless the movie because its about action and drama. The movie talk's about Eddie Morra (Bradley Cooper) is a disheveled unemployed writer. He has a contract to write a book but is more talk than action. No matter how hard he tries, He just can't summon the inspiration to write a single word. That all changes when an old friend wanders back into Eddie life and give him a mysterious pill that enables the user to access 100 percent of his brain abilities. With the help of the mysterious pill Eddie becomes a financial wizard but it also puts him in a new world with lots of dangers.Limitless is an American thriller film directed by Neil Burger and starring Bradley cooper, Abbie Cornish, and Robert de Niro. The lead actor Bradley Cooper actually surprised me. I never thought he was a bad actor, but he was able to honestly portray a guy that had absolutely nothing going for him and became a ""somebody."" Robert de niro has also performed incredibly giving the movie a new dimension. Abbie Cornish also performed well by adding a romantic aspect to the movie.Eddie (Bradley Cooper)'s attempts to write a novel and his inability to push himself to seek refinement is evident with his apartment, his relationship with his otherwise focused girlfriend and his dependent finances. At such a juncture, he stumbles upon his ex- brother-in-law who introduces an experimental designer drug that enhances brain functionality to harness all its potential. As his landlord's wife who yaks at him for the pending rent then confronts him, Eddie chooses an intelligent escape by taking one of the pills and then, whatever he has seen, heard, read or experienced in his life, is available to him as reference. Knowledge acquisition is rapid and so is its retention. Eddie soon discovers that he can achieve the impossible like Bruce Almighty and as greed takes over, he seeks to exploit the financial markets to make some astronomical gains. Overnight success draws inquisitive eyes of the ambitious and Eddie would need to maintain a low profile if he doesn't want to expose his secret to his phenomenal analytical abilities. Veteran investor Carl Loon (Robert De Niro) employs Eddie and gives him the incredible opportunity to make it to the big league in a very short time. Just when it all seems to be going his way, Eddie realizes that the pills have an adverse effect on his health and without a regular intake; he would almost lose his life. To add to that, he is pursued by a goon who now knows the secret to his supreme abilities and demands more pills for himself. I have to say that this movie panders to my particular taste, which is to say it has a well crafted story for our times, good acting and just the right blend of New York atmosphere mixed with a sci-fi feel. The other main issue is drugs. I personally have partook in the search for an intelligence enhancing substance and it was quite believable to watch Bradley Cooper transform from a bohemian-slob to a brainiac-overacheiver. The characters were well written and thought-out. The situations were too close to home for me to ignore. The character driven story was exemplary to any current sci-fi f A pill can make you smart is indeed an interesting concept but what is more interesting is the directing. It's not an ordinary thriller movie. The director gave a lot of style in this movie to make it more exciting. It definitely works and the movie is limitlessly entertaining. There are some plot holes that the filmmakers doesn't intend to fix it but still it's worth watching. In short, The movie is of course about an intellectual pill. It's intriguing to know what's the side effects of it. Well, it's quite fun to know what's going to happened to the protagonist but the movie's smartness isn't very limitless. There are massive plot holes in here. There are also some confusion in this. If there is something limitless in here then it's the entertainment quality. Neil Burger gave a lot of style and ridiculousness in this film. The editing was quite fast and fun. The zooming in through places is amazing. The soundtrack and the music score does perfectly fit in every scene. The performances were good. Bradley Cooper is an entertaining actor but he had some weaknesses in serious scenes like crying or being scared. Robert De Niro only shows up in times but you know him, he is just being himself and there is nothing wrong with that. Overall the movie is ridiculously fun. The movie is no cliché, it's all unique by so many reasons including the trippy, vertigo, and zooming in style. It's intriguing, it's fast, and it's smart at times. ""Limitless"" is another movie that has merits that ignore the flaws. It's just a non-stop entertaining solid flick.ilms. If you like science fiction this is the movie for you. I would recommend it for kids from above 15 years old. Form my point of view this is a exciting and inspirational movie ever directed and made. This is the great thriller movie. When rating this movie, it deserver's a 9 out of 10 because of its exciting features. I Am 19 years old undergraduate studying international business form China gave the following review.

457,jamalgalette,Great Story Line,8,23 March 2015,Great story line and overall acting. Appreciated the visuals this movie incorporated without doing too much. One of my favorite movies. I specifically enjoyed the colorless to colorful transitions the director incorporated. The idea of this movie created more life in the mind of the viewer for endless possibilities. Light humor provided some smooth scene transitions. The movie creates an image in the mind of the viewer that definitely lasts. Watching this you never become lost in the storyline and the plot is very understandable so it allows for great flowing. The actors do great jobs of portraying their roles and even the extras seem involved in each scene they are incorporated into. I give it a 8/10 because its doesn't seem to be a timeless movie. But I loved it,Limitless
458,missdramamama,Such a Great Movie,8,31 August 2015,"Limitless is by far one of my favorite movies just because of how intense the film is. You are always wondering what will happen next and what will happen with Eddie Morra and his adventure with this pill. This pill that Morra takes let's him use the other 80% of our brain that we supposedly never get to use. It makes you extremely intelligent to the point where you can do anything. I love adventure and action so this movie suits me. It was really interesting how they brought science into the film with the pill and how to find a way where all people could use it. The only down part to this movie would be that this pill is very unrealistic and is almost impossible to be done. The acting was phenomenal to say the least. I felt like I was in the movie trying to find out how people could live off the pill. Some people say that the movie is too unrealistic because if someone's IQ shot up that high, they could get sick or die. To me, it is a movie, not real life, and it was great.",Limitless
459,vipinkrchaurasia,Limitless,8,10 November 2018,"If you've ever found yourself staring into nothingness, wondering why you couldn't muster even a hair of energy to get up and do something, then you're going to find this movie highly satisfying. Limitless takes you on a ride... and that's not an exaggeration. The computer graphics create a glimpse into what it would actually feel like to be a ""super-you."" The writers also did a great job of creating a character that from the start... pretty much charms your pants off. Bradley Cooper actually surprised me. I never thought he was a bad actor, but he was able to honestly portray a guy that had absolutely nothing going for him and became a ""somebody."" The movie graphics, plot, and main actors (well, DeNiro, Cooper, and Johnny Whitworth) were all intriguing. It's not just a movie about what crazy things some drug can make you do... it creates a discussion within each of us, ""What if you could unlock all the potential of YOUR mind, who would you be?"" Now the downsides... some of the supporting actors were very weak. Also, there were some scenarios that went off the deep end but actually had the audience laughing hysterically so it wasn't exactly a bad thing. If you thought you'd get a deep or scientific explanation for the drug... don't hold your breath. Thankfully the plot was engaging enough that you didn't really care. The movie had some interesting ideas but some that I especially loved were the ones about identity, and about taking something to make yourself better and whether that meant you were actually you or an altered you. Does it matter even? One last thing I gotta say though, the one guy, Johnny Whitworth, did a really great job. I hope he gets some major roles in the future because I think he's very talented.I'd definitely recommend watching this movie. If only just for the ridiculous scene with the skates. Hilarious.",Limitless
460,youngkim-73245,good!,9,1 December 2015,"Limitless, was released in 2011, directed by Neil Burger and starring Bradley Cooper, Abbie Cornish and Robert De Niro. It has a fast paced story and action scenes which gives us an electrifying feeling. In addition, it has a solid story line which supports the fast pacing of the film in a logical way.The movie starts in an old, messy room which is in the poor area of China Town in New York, where one poor looking man, Eddie, played by Bradley Cooper, is writing a novel but it seems to be going badly. While he is out grocery shopping, he runs into his ex-wife's brother Vernon who gives him some pills which he thinks are just drugs. But after taking a pill he finds that the pills improve his cognitive functions and rapidly speed up his ability to write. With the effect of the pills in place he finishes writing the novel in a single day. As he had been a poor, unknown writer for a long time, he becomes addicted to the pills and the improvements they bring. However, he finds that cannot afford more of them. In order to steal more pills, he uses his existing stock to increase his ability and carry out a daring plan.A major feature of the film is the way in which it connects us with the protagonist and his plight, as we have all at one time or another metaphorically been that writer stuck and unable to progress. The camera work of the film uses a style similar to that of hand camera home films where it keeps wobbling around, like in a documentary. This is complimented by the story's intense pacing, and is shown with lots of scenes passing rapidly to coincide with Eddie's thought processes. This keeps us on the edge of our seats all through the movie. Despite the large amount of information being shown, the film expresses it clearly through Eddie's narration and special effects. So, even though it's not a racing movie or a violent thriller movie, we feel a sense of speed.It's an uncommon tale that is unlikely to take place around us, yet still it draws us into the story with its strong, fascinating and intelligent story devices. If you are sick of your daily routine, this movie is guaranteed to give you the perfect electrifying experience in 100 minutes.",Limitless

The story line was that a group of professors and students at a college were experimenting with an experimental new drug that enhanced both the mind and the body. It allowed one of the professor's, Skip Homier, after taking the drug, to become this hulking strong man with super strength and intelligence. The opening teaser of the episode shows this hulking figure slowly walking down a college hallway in the middle of the night and ripping a steal door off its hinges and then choking the night watchmen while he holds him two feet off the floor.

464,Chef_Brian,A pretty good action/thriller,7,10 March 2011,"Limitless seems like an attempt to push Bradley Cooper out of his Romance/Comedy safe zone and into the role of future possible action star. He's built right for it too, sort of more likable Matthew McConaughey with his chiseled looks and piercing blue eyes. Limitless attempts to do for Cooper what The Bourne Identity did for Matt Damon; remake him from a pretty boy romantic lead into a gritty dark hero.It works too, for the most part. Limitless is a fun ride all the way through and it's visually striking to boot. It opens with a steady camera zooming through Manhatten, through streets and taxi cab windows, it sets a good tone for the rest of the film.The story centres around the myth that humans are only using a tiny portion of our brains at once. Cooper plays Edward Morra, a writer with a book contract but a terrible case of writers block. Within the first few minutes he's dumped by his girlfriend for lack of motivation in his life and runs into his ex brother-in-law, from a very brief marriage right after college. Vernon, the ex-brother-in-law is never given a last name because he's only there to introduce the main plot of the movie. He gives Morra a clear pill that he claims will give him the focus he needs to finish his book, along with his business card just in case. Being in a desperate state Morra takes the pill while being shouted at by his landlords wife for being behind on the rent. Within thirty seconds he's deducing everything around him and naturally, beds the wife and does her law school paper that she was stressing over. He then writes a massive chunk of the novel and falls asleep. The next morning he's lost his newfound mental abilities but he does have enough of a novel to hand in to his publisher along with a fantastically clean apartment, being that a side effect of the drug is OCD, apparently.He stops by Vernons apartment to see about getting some more, but this is where things go wrong. The plot unfolds around Morra using his stash of the drug to advance quickly through the world of high finance, attracting the attention of Robert De Niro, playing a sinister Warren Beatey-type of stock market broker, while avoiding sinister figures who are after every pill they can find and are killing everyone connected to it. Also, it turns out that the drug has serious side effects if you take it regularly but will also kill you if you stop.It's best if you don't think about the movie and just enjoy the story and stunning visual effects. There are plot holes big enough to throw Matthew McConaughey's ego through, but considering the movie is built upon a faulty premise, picking it apart defeats the purpose. It's just a fun thriller that gives you a couple hours of entertainment. It's well made, well acted and is paced about right.There is one scene where he licks blood off the floor (because it's laced with the drug) that will absolutely kill any romantic comedy hotness Mr Cooper possessed, but I don't think that's anything but a plus. It just means we might see him expand more into action oriented roles, and if Limitless is any indication, he might just be able to swing it.",Limitless

I felt I was watching a really good movie until the last ten minutes, when it seems the story writers themselves ran out of the miracle drug. The last sequence is simply bad; it makes little sense to carry the story forward in the viewer's mind when exiting the cinema, and it may also be seen as condoning drug abuse. And why Van Loon was all of a sudden a bad guy is incoherent with the rest of the storyline. To me, the ending destroyed the whole movie. Everything (or at least most) up till then was well thought through and coherent in its own way (apart from what actually happened to the dead model and why the bodyguard/henchman was on the list of people using the drug as well as why was sitting on the bench next to Eddie when he called him). Too bad they couldn't patch together a good ending to an otherwise promising movie.",Limitless
