0,bkoganbing,Basketball and Dope,9,1 February 2009,"The Basketball Diaries is the story of the true experiences of Jim Carroll, underground poet and entertainer, and how he overcame drug addiction to become what he is today. Leonardo DiCaprio plays the role of Carroll. The film is not for the squeamish and it has the best drug withdrawal scenes since Frank Sinatra did Man With The Golden Arm.We first meet Leo with his friends Mark Wahlberg, Patrick McGaw, and James Maddio as a group of delinquent Catholic school kids. They all play basketball and they all are constantly in trouble. DiCaprio is your kid with all the teen angst and self conscious about his lower class status. His mother, Lorraine Bracco, works as a chambermaid in some swank Manhattan hotel and I'm sure she parts with some big bucks to see her kid gets a Catholic school education. There's no father in the picture.But drugs of all kinds are available and the whole group of them get hooked with the exception of McGaw who breaks with his friends. The title is based on the notebook diary writings that DiCaprio keeps. Eventually they're published and Carroll is acclaimed and still today as a writer who speaks to young people today. Leo and the rest of the cast give some terrific performances. It's easy to see why he and Mark Wahlberg became the stars they have with this film. Also Bruno Kirby as the closeted gay basketball coach who misreads DiCaprio's mind and comes on to him is also a standout.The Basketball Diaries hopefully if seen by some of the young will serve as a 'scared straight' guide to saying no to drugs. This film really does show the horrible consequences of a destructive drug habit and the fact it can be beaten and one can live a most useful life.",The Basketball Diaries
1,SnoopyStyle,lacks tension,6,25 May 2015,"Catholic schoolboy Jim Carroll (Leonardo DiCaprio) lives with his mother (Lorraine Bracco). He's the brash leader of his friends Pedro (James Madio), Neutron (Patrick McGaw) and Mickey (Mark Wahlberg) sniffing glue and causing trouble. They play winning basketball for their lecherous coach Swifty (Bruno Kirby). His best friend Bobby (Michael Imperioli) is dying of leukemia. He plays neighborhood ball with Reggie (Ernie Hudson). He starts to do cocaine and then heroin which sends him down a very dark road.The movie seems to take place in both the present day and somewhere in the 60s. That conflicted feel along with the poetic diary entries create a surreal dreamlike vibe. It takes the tension out of the movie and limits the immediacy. Leo and everybody do a good job. Leo's star power shines and keeps the movie interesting. However, I just don't feel a sense of danger from this dark coming-of-age movie.",The Basketball Diaries
2,lee_eisenberg,"more than gritty, and there's really no link to Columbine",8,8 June 2006,"I remember that when the Columbine shootings happened, some people blamed ""The Basketball Diaries"". When I saw the movie, I couldn't understand the connection at all. True, there's a school shooting scene, but focusing only on that misses the movie's point. The movie is the true story of New York teenager Jim Carroll (Leonardo DiCaprio) and how he descended into the ugly world of drug addiction. If you're squeamish, then I should warn you that there are some pretty nasty scenes of drug addiction and what happens.Yes, it's ugly what happens, but that's what makes the movie so good: they're not afraid to get down and dirty. Also starring are Lorraine Bracco as Jim's mother, Mark Wahlberg as Jim's friend, Bruno Kirby as the high school coach, Juliette Lewis as an acquaintance, and Ernie Hudson as a man who saves Jim from dying out in the cold.Like I said, this is not a movie for the fainthearted. But otherwise, I truly recommend it.",The Basketball Diaries
3,moonspinner55,It doesn't involve the audience--and is too aloof to be harrowing,4,26 June 2005,"From Jim Carroll's autobiographical book about Catholic school rebel and promising basketball athlete who deteriorates after turning to heroin. Film takes Carroll's story out of the 1960's and into modern times, which muddies the scenario and leaves behind some confusing dislocation. Decent acting makes it semi-tolerable, particularly by Bruno Kirby as the basketball coach, but the movie is very sour and cynical--that is, until the final scene when it decides to turn preachy! Leonardo DiCaprio does his standard eye-squinting, pointing-with-his-nostrils thing, his fashionably limp hair hanging near his eyes. He's at the center of the drama, and yet it's easy to forget about him. ** from ****",The Basketball Diaries
4,Quinoa1984,does what it needs to do- tell us a mostly tragic and sometimes inspirational story- with talent and verve,8,22 July 2010,"The Basketball Diaries is a film that has a little bit of poetry in the midst of a sea of reflection. It's Jim Carroll's story of how he grew up in high school among a love for basketball and heroin, and poetry when he could. He had talents, but the film's goal is to show that someone who is smart and bright and outgoing can destroy themselves, and when given the right dramatic heft and actor presence it can rise above possible After-School Special trappings. Basketball Diaries helped launch a couple of careers, and give a few good ones a little more room to work, and it doesn't spare characters who went into oblivion either by death or overdose or jail.I think what works for me seeing the film again- it had been years before and only in small chunks, remembering a song here (The Doors' ""Riders on the Storm"" in staggering slow-motion as the guys on downers fumble a game) or a performance there (Mark Wahlberg in his first serious dramatic performance as Jim's scuzzy friend Mickey)- is the attitude and the dedication to the artistry behind the message. It could be a self-serious portrait, or just too exploitive, but the filmmaker finds a good middle-ground to work with. We know early on what makes Jim so depressed and anxious, the death of a close friend (to cancer, played in a few really remarkable scenes by Michael Imperioli), and the only significant fault is to see how quickly Jim jumps from that death to drugs. The film, if anything, could be a little longer.But seeing how DiCaprio pulls off Carroll is one of the thrills of the picture. It's not always easy to get into the state of a drug-addled youth, and as Jim he gets deep into what makes him clever and resourceful and how his own worst enemy overtakes him. I'm reminded of The Panic in Needle Park, where we get to see a whole sort of degraded sub-culture that looks too low for the main characters, at first, and then becomes their entire world. Again, other New York actors get to shine in spots (Lorraine Bracco gets her spotlight as she kicks Jim out of her house, and Bruno Kirby gets a weird supporting role as the Coach on the team with something to hide), and the film gets in some rather dark humor in a few spots such as a hyped-up basketball game played at night in the rain and put to Carroll's own band's song (""Die Die!""). Yet I kept coming back to DiCaprio, his star power and magnetism, and how he commanded the film in both Jim's high points and deep dark lows.So, you can watch it for the message, which is fairly cut and dry and deep down isn't very deep, or you can watch it for its craft and its attempt to rise above itself to be about a place and state of mind, real people affected by addiction and betrayal and despair. Certainly it has one of the best ""coming off of junk"" scenes with a small part for Ernie Hudson.",The Basketball Diaries
5,sunwarrior13,Basketball Memoirs,9,7 January 2012,"Very loosely based on the memoir of the same name, The Basketball Diaries transposes the late '60s adolescence of writer and artist Jim Carroll to some unspecified time period at least 15 years later, further confusing the time frame with three decades of rock music, some by Carroll himself.The movie stars Leonardo DiCaprio, Lorraine Bracco, James Madio, and Mark Wahlberg.It was directed by Scott Kalvert.Jim and his Catholic school chums are on the hottest basketball team in New York, but their friend Bobby languishes in the hospital with leukemia. In-between typically boyish adventures, Jim scribbles in his notebook and experiments with sex and drugs. His group of friends begins to disintegrate after coach Swifty not only makes a pass at Jim, but also catches him and his pals using drugs on the court and kicks them off the team. Out of school and on the streets, Jim turns tricks, betrays friends, robs stores, and deals drugs to feed his heroin addiction. Not even the efforts of former addict Reggie can cure Jim.Soon, the dark streets of New York become a refuge from his mother's mounting concern for her son. He cannot go home and his only escape from the reality of the streets is heroin for which he steals, robs and prostitutes himself. Only with the help of Reggie, an older neighborhood friend with whom Jim ""picked up a game"" now and then, is he able to begin the long journey back to sanity, which ultimately ends with Jim's incarceration in a state penitentiary. After months in the hospital, he gets out and later does a talk show about his drug life, but before that he turned down free drugs given to him by his old friend, Pedro.Jim started out as a practice basketball player, and moved on to writing his memoirs.Although it masquerades as a cautionary tale about the horrors of heroin, this epic of teen-age angst is more accurately seen as a reverential wallow in the gutter of self-absorption.One thing about the plot is that the view never understand what really motivated this intelligent adolescent, a gifted basketball player and sensitive writer, to descend into the hellish life of a drug addict and hustler on the mean streets of New York.It only showed how drugs can destroy one's life.As for the movie,it was a must-see as you get a glimpse of the great actor Leonardo DiCaprio is going to be.",The Basketball Diaries
6,hitchcockthelegend,Jim Carroll's autobiographical account of his descent in to drug hell.,7,7 March 2009,"Basketball Diaries as a title conjures up quite a few images, none of them quite in tune with what this film is actually about. Jim Carroll loved to write and kept a journal of his life as it spiralled out of control, part of a group of Catholic lads who formed the school's basketball team, three of whom rebelled to such a degree it destroyed their futures, this is Jim's story. It's a harsh picture at times, but to me it never quite breaks free from a Hollywood sheen, with the reality being that if it didn't star Leonardo DiCaprio and Mark Wahlberg, it would have largely been run of the mill stuff. Both actors do good work here, with DiCaprio hinting at the great ability that was to come. His transformation from jovial school prankster to self destroyed sap lifts the film way above the ordinary. As Carroll's mother, Lorraine Bracco is badly under written, and the always reliable Bruno Kirby does fine with what he is given. Juliet Lewis pops in and out as a sort of moral warning character, while Ernie Hudson {in perhaps the films critical role} sadly suffers purely because the mentor character has become hackneyed over the years.It's a good film, but after waiting for such a long time for it to be adapted to the screen, the final result falls somewhere in between twee and impacting. 6.5/10",The Basketball Diaries
7,jotix100,St. Vitus' Dance,7,26 June 2004,"There is a type of disease associated with St. Vitus and this film qualifies in the comparison because it's quirky, fast, and it never stops moving. Director Scott Kalvert gives the movie a 'look' that makes the Manhattan of the period when it supposedly takes place,  believable.Leonardo DiCaprio was at his best in the film. His performance is very nuanced and in your face, at the same time. Mr. DiCaprio makes you feel the pain Jim is going through; he is a lost soul. Not being a fan of Mark Wahlberg, I must confess that in this film, be it because of the direction, or whatever, he shines, as Mickey. As Jim's mother, Lorraine Bracco has never been better in anything she has been in recent memory. Bruno Kirby is perfectly creepy as the coach of St. Vitus High School. As far as the connection with the Columbine School massacre, since the sequence where Jim is involved is a dream, it's easy to understand how the twisted minds of the ones responsible for the killings would have taken this scene as a model for their terrible crime.",The Basketball Diaries
8,TBJCSKCNRRQTreviews,"In the next life, Father, *I'm* holding the paddle",7,25 February 2010,"I haven't read the novel that this is based upon. It wasn't intentional that I watched this so soon after seeing Shutter Island. This is a very grim and realistic look at drug use. The pace is energetic, much like the youth, and later slows down, but there is not a boring or unengaging moment to be found in this. This utilizes a somewhat loose cinematography, and it helps to make this all feel spontaneous and less like a linear progression of events. The editing is great. This has marvelous acting, from DiCaprio, Hudson, Wahlberg, Bracco, and so forth. The characters are credible, well-developed and distinguish themselves. I would point out that Juliette Lewis is not in this an awful lot(which is not to say that she isn't excellent when she does appear), and yet her name was on the cover of my copy. Not sure why they felt they needed to sell it further, and why they wouldn't use the aforementioned talents in the cast. This is quite disgusting at times. There is plenty of strong language and disturbing content and a bit of sexuality(if only a little of it is graphic) in this. I recommend this to anyone who wants a film about narcotics and addiction. 7/10",The Basketball Diaries
9,deloudelouvain,One of the best drug addiction movies.,10,30 June 2020,"There are plenty of good movies about drug addiction but The Basketball Diaries definitely belongs to the better ones. It's the kind of movie you would show your kids to let them understand how quickly they could descend in hell, living from one fix to another. Heroin addiction is terrible, it makes you turn into a lying decieving little thief, prepared to do anything to get your next fix, chasing a high they will never get anymore like in the beginning. The movie is beautifully written by Jim Carroll, based on his personal experiences. The cast is very young, it's a delight to see a young Leonardo DiCaprio that did an excellent job by the way. The role he played showed already what a great actor he will become in the future. The rest of the cast was also very good, with a young Mark Wahlberg like I didn't see before. The Basketball Diaries is one of those movies I won't ever forget and could watch multiple times, a story worth to be told, and if it could just save one kid of not taking the worst decision of his life it's already a victory. A must see!",The Basketball Diaries
10,Smells_Like_Cheese,A good adaption of a book of the tragic life of Jim Carrol,8,12 November 2003,"May I say, that I was impressed with this movie. It shows the truth of drugs and what they can do to you. After I saw this movie, I went out and found the book and read it. It's more sad then the movie, but still seeing Leonardo's performance is very effective. Jim Carrol is a high school basketball player who once in a while gets stoned with his friends. But eventually he becomes brutally addicted to the drugs and looses everything he has worked for.To Leonardo, you did good.8/10",The Basketball Diaries
11,=G=,"Just say ""No"" to this flick.",5,21 January 2001,"""Basketball Diaries"" is just another flick about the moody, angst filled, angry, self-destructive adolescent behavior of young men growing up...in this case catholic boys in New York City who play basketball. The film seems to have little purpose other than trying to out do itself with one audience shock after another as it follows the boys from the confessional through the ""mean streets"" embellished with a lame sort of poetic pesudo-philosophical narration. Lots of over acting, little plot, and a protagonist we're not made to care about. Billed as based on the writings of Jim Carroll, this film is really based on the imaginings of the screen writer and director.",The Basketball Diaries
12,Edvis-1997,8,8,7 August 2020,"Saw this when I was in high schoold ( part of education plan) and it surprised in good way and sad way how realistic it was. I just loved it. I don't get it why critics giving it only 46/100 lol, so underrated.",The Basketball Diaries
13,callanvass,"Vivid look at the life of a young drug addict, DiCaprio is unforgettable",9,9 October 2013,"I didn't know much about Jim Carroll going into this one. But this movie vividly depicts him, and it stuck with me after it was over. It's unabashedly unpleasant, but extremely effective. There are many controversial moments in this film. Jim (DiCaprio) gets spanked with a paddle by a Father. There is a storyline where Jim's basketball coach happens to be gay, and hits on Jim (Brilliantly played by Bruno Kirby) an old lady gets mugged and beaten up, there are many vivid dream sequences that are quite violent, and more. It definitely pushes the envelope. Jim isn't exactly entirely sympathetic here. He does some questionable things to say the least, that made me shake my head, but you can't help but feel sympathy when he succumbs to major drug use. I wanted to jump into the screen and help him many times. As great and powerful as this movie is, this movie belongs to Leo DiCaprio. His incredible showcase here had me in awe. I didn't feel he was an actor playing Jim Carroll, It felt like he WAS Jim Carroll. He looked and acted like a drug addict. This is Leo's movie, despite a very capable supporting cast, and he nails it with perfection. Leo's withdrawal scenes gave me chills, and it's something I'll never forget. It's no surprise as to why Leo is one of Hollywood's best actors, going today. Lorraine Braco is excellent as the torn Mom. She doesn't have a ton of screen time, but she plays a pivotal part. Her scenes with Leo are very good. Mark Whlaberg plays a scumbag to a T. I hated him, and I'm sure you will too. It was a great performance. Juliette Lewis has a small part as a hooker, and Jim Caroll himself has a small role as a drug dealer. Basketball Diaries does have somewhat of a happy ending. After all the turmoil I went through in this movie, it was nice to be relieved with something heartwarmingFinal Thoughts: This is a movie that will be entrenched in my mind for some time. Make sure you're in the right frame of mind if you decide to view this. It's an extremely bleak experience, but well worth it. It's a must see. You won't find many performances that can match Leo DiCaprio's in Basketball Diaries9.2/10",The Basketball Diaries
14,The-Sarkologist,One seriously confronting movie about the world of heroin,8,14 October 2011,"There was a huge uproar regarding this movie because of a scene where the main character walks into his classroom and starts gunning everybody down with a shotgun. As is typical everybody has missed the whole point of the movie. It is not designed to encourage school shootings, but to show people what heroin is really like. When it comes to violence on television and video games then I will repeat what was said to me once, not that anybody will listen - people are so stubborn that once that have a mindset, no amount of reason will change their mind. Anyway, before television there was an awful lot of violence - the Napoleonic Wars, the thirty years war, the crusades, and even World War I: probably one of the most violent of wars. Even then before literature or even the written language, Cain killed Abel, and he did not do it because a video game made him think that it was a good idea. Violence is apart of our nature and we do it because we are frustrated with the world and the way people react to us. It is basic to our nature, and I am not saying that it is alright, but rather stopping violence in the media is not going to change anything.The Basketball Diaries is about a heroin addict. We follow his life from when he becomes one to when he finally gives up. Even though he does not start off as a heroin addict, he is still taking drugs, or rather sniffing glue. He, Jim Carol, hangs with three other friends and they simply act like teenagers with a lot of energy. Jim is also a champion basketball player. There is a darker side to his life and that is that his best friend is dying of Leukemia. He does not want to believe it, but it is reality and once he dies things slowly begin to change. We are not sure what really happens, but I guess it has something to do with the realisation that they are no longer immortal. But that is not the main reason, it more has to do with the pain and the loss that he suffers after his friend dies, and it is not something that they could have fought against - in fact he was powerless to do anything about it. The realisation of ones weakness is a true humbliser.Starting the addiction is not focused that heavily on in the movie, but his first trip is, and it shows him running through a field of flowers. It is more that he describes how all of his pain has gone away - both the emotional and the physical. This is the thing about Heroin - it is one of the world's best painkillers, but it is also an incredibly addictive drug. What we see is how his life collapses around him as he becomes addicted to Heroin. He is kicked out of school, slowly looses his friends as they are each arrested for various crimes, and finally he himself is taken away as he lies in a pathetic heap before the door to his mothers' apartment. Near the end we even see him resort of Homosexuality, something that horrifies him, especially when he is molested by the basketball coach, to get money for drugs. This is further undermined when the drugs he purchases are fake.The Basketball Diaries is an incredible movie and shows something that we wish to ignore. The school shooting scene is not all that bad, and more shows his frustration with life and the way the drugs take away this frustration - but at a cost. It is something that has been taken right out of proportion and as such people take the wrong idea about the film.",The Basketball Diaries
15,tomgillespie2002,"Well-acted, but poorly executed",3,13 February 2011,"Based on the autobiographical novel written by Jim Carroll, The Basketball Diaries follows one young man's descent into addiction, crime and homelessness. Jim (here played with mature dedication by Leonardo Di Caprio) is a promising high school basketball player, who along with his three friends, enjoy shooting hoops and getting into general mischief. What starts out as a past-time, soon deteriorates into something more deprived and desperate, as Jim sees his world crash around him as his drug habit becomes an unstoppable affliction.When Jim's situation gets so desperate that he leaves home to hustle and rob on the streets, he begins to push away the people in his life that were once close to him. His mother, played by Lorraine Bracco, throws him out after the extremities of his situation become apparent to her and refuses him back. Reggie (Ernie Hudson) was an inspirational figure and mentor to Jim and regularly met up to play basketball in the court. And Neutron (Patrick McGaw) distances himself from Jim and his friends' habits and focuses on his basketball career, much to Jim's dismay. These people will all have a profound effect on Jim's eventual redemption. The film also switches the book's real-life setting from 1960's New York to the 90's.What The Basketball Diaries attempts to do is to create a realistic and gritty (a phrase that seems to be thrown around a lot these days) depiction of drug abuse, and create a hellish portrait of a confused young man who his throwing away his many talents in favour of a life that is doing nothing but ruining his life and isolating the people around him. In reality, this is a terribly-directed film that seems to sledgehammer the phrase 'drugs are bad' into the viewers skull, rather than having the nerve, or in deed the respect, to let the audience make their own mind up. Or maybe the director doesn't have the skill to create a film capable of conjuring up those feelings in the viewer. It sounds ridiculous, but if you have seen the South Park episode where Mr Mackey is giving his anti-drug lecture by simply listing the drugs that are 'bad', then you can see a clear parallel to this film. Jim basically goes from one drug to the other and one crime to the next. It's not interesting, convincing, and to be honest I found it all just very annoying.Jim is a character of no redeeming qualities. He's selfish, careless, and is basically a whiny little kid. Fair enough, this is a chance to develop an interesting, fully-rounded character, but director Scott Kalvert and scriptwriter Bryan Goluboff cannot combine their 'skills' to pull it off. Even though Jim narrates the film and reveals everything about his feelings and opinions, and Di Caprio's fantastic performance, we never get inside Jim's head enough to understand him and why he is willing to give up on a fledging basketball career. This is a character that we're supposed to be praying for to overcome his addiction, but (spoilers!) when his clean-break arrived, I asked myself should I be feeling happy for this arsehole?A well-acted film all-round, namely from the lead and Mark Wahlberg as his friend Mickey, but a film that is swamped in faults and scenes that are just ridiculous. Possibly only remotely remembered for the controversial scene where Jim storms his school with a shotgun in a drug-addled fantasy, which was caught up in the media storm surrounding the Columbine High School massacre. Watch only for signs of early promise from Di Caprio, but otherwise avoid.www.the-wrath-of-blog.blogspot.com",The Basketball Diaries
16,Dr_Coulardeau,When Di Caprio was an innocent poignant teenager,10,30 January 2007,"Leonardo Dicaprio had a tremendous potential when he was still a teenager or so. He had the physique of his age. He had the style of his age. He had the flexibility and obvious lack of selfconsciousness typical of his age. And he finds himself in this story, true or not does not matter at all, in one inspiring tale that seems to be a personal tale. He lives his story so strongly, so intensely that he really takes us into the story and makes us feel the horror of his trip down into the hell of the syringe, of the shot, of the nosejob, and eventually of some blowjob to finance the trip itself. And he had a potential in the film too as a basketball player. But somewhere along the way he met bad company in the street. Somewhere along the way on some New York sidewalk he lost his best friend, his basketball hero to, leukemia.Somewhere between here and there he lost track of his body, of his muscles, of his basketball potential, of his desire to be on the top, of his loving mother that he started betraying like in a dark blind sunless and lightless alley. Drugs transform your life into some kind of unravelling piece of cloth lost in the rainstorm or snowstorm of a bad season, be it cold or be it warm, it does not matter because you only hope to enjoy and die when high in your trance. Maybe the best scene is when he goes cold turkey at Reggie's home or when he begs at his mother's door. But like all teenagers, he will have to grow out of it and into a new phase, whereas the other members of his gang will not. The end of the film is so sad in a way because he is growing up but he has lost his innocence, or if you prefer his innocent guilt, and now he is going to carry and wear his fake because guilty adult innocence that is going to hide what he was, what he has done, what he nostalgically remembers and will remember for the rest of his life. And that is when Leonardo Dicaprio becomes a little bit cold, distant, unreal. We don't feel him so well in this transformation that requires some depth built on the death of something in his mind caused by the death of something and someone, and maybe many someones, outside in the wide wild world. We feel so sorry he did not find his way to adulthood depth, except in his eyes. Don't you ever look at him straight in the eyes. You may then fall in some mental abyss. His eyes, man, his steel sharp daggers of two eyes are what is going to grow of age fastest and deepest.Dr Jacques COULARDEAU, University of Paris Dauphine & University of Paris 1 Pantheon Sorbonne",The Basketball Diaries
17,Floated2,Powerful performance but lacking to make a strong impression,6,4 June 2020,"Having heard of the strong praise regarding this film due to Leonardo Dicaprio's performance, and the fact it dealt with heavy subject matter depicting a real life story. The acting is well done, believable and authentic but the characters aren't exactly one we care for.The script and story is very quite simple and relatively predictable. It somewhat feels like a little more edgy MTV type teen picture.Had slightly higher expectations of this film due to its high IMDB rating (7.3) and the praise it has received over the years but in the end it was nothing more than a little above average.It was a star turning leading performance for Dicaprio, which perhaps maybe the reason as the strong following. But none the less, the Basketball Diaries wasn't exactly great.Also it was not a tough watch as many claim, as there have been far more daring coming of age and realistic drug portrayals- done better.",The Basketball Diaries
18,jzappa,Hoop Terrors,7,7 September 2011,"Jim Carroll's The Basketball Diaries tells in tattered detail how the author went in a few short months from being a Catholic high school basketball star to being a strung-out heroin addict who turned tricks for drugs. Like many such stories, it hangs fondly over the shock and repulsion, and ends with unbecoming quickness after contentment is recovered. Will there ever be a venue for a film about a character who skips through his drug period because he's so excited to show us what he did after he pulled his socks up? Not likely. If there's anything more tiresome than a scandalous parable with a lesson at the end, it's the lesson minus the parable.And so this reverential flounder in the sewer of narcissism shows us profusely that if you become addicted to drugs, you're prone to discover yourself living distraughtly on the streets, selling a body that looks increasingly less like a worthwhile purchase. Carroll was a kid who notwithstanding his misery attempted to develop his experience into prose. The snag with Scott Kalvert's film is that he's apt to translate the experiences too literally: Jim is so urgently pale and miserable that the idealism feels vain. He plays basketball at night in the rain after his best friend dies of leukemia, and it just looks wholly contrived, fake and banal, not poignant.As the film begins, Jim is on the basketball team at a Catholic high school in New York, where a depraved priest drools while spanking disobedient students with a full-size paddle and the class cringes rhythmically. This scene's more indebted to Victorian pornography than to any real private school in 20th century America. Jim and his friends are not upright Catholic boys. They steal from the lockers of the opposing basketball team, and the preferred off-court activity is experimenting with inhalants and pills. Swifty, the coach played by Bruno Kirby, makes implausible passes at Jim. And Jim's mother, played by a sadly wasted Lorraine Bracco, is a crudely flat character who functions here exclusively to implement tough love by kicking him out.Life for Jim is a descending coil of pills, cough medicine, booze, diving off cliffs into the Harlem River, fainting during a game and masturbating on the roof. There are also stirring gleans into the underbelly of users, pushers, hookers and pimps, as Jim floats at large from his comfort zones, while recording all in his diary. Jim's writing predictably operates as a narration. Like most poetry written by teenagers, it's childish idealism, agonizingly earnest, seeing life as sad because the writer's not happy. Soon though, he samples heroin, and ""any ache, pain, sadness or guilt was completely flushed out."" Remarkable, how real life unravels exactly like the movies.The movie hinges on three hard-wearing formulas: Jim facilitates his dying friend's temporary escape from the hospital so he can push his wheelchair down 42nd Street, Jim sees his ex-teammate on TV playing in an all-star game while Jim is in a squalid bar and, of course, Jim is rescued by a dignified black man, who finds him out cold, brings him home and puts him through cold turkey. In accounts like this, you can continuously rely on a laudable black ex-hoodlum, combing the streets for distressed white kids, functioning for white tolerance soap-boxing purposes as hidden supplies of authenticity and honor.DiCaprio does what he can with the role. Ernie Hudson is solid as the ex-junkie, and there is genuine feeling in Bracco's underwritten mother. But it's Juliette Lewis, as a greasy hooker, who once again taps an utterly real edge. But the movie is not credible. By the end, Jim is seen going in through a stage door, and then we hear him telling the story of his decline and recuperation. We can't determine if this is intended to be actual acknowledgment or a show: That's the whole movie's trouble.While the film has a preachy earnestness more like older films that take drug issues in hand, its mercilessly murky concentration on the despair of drug abuse makes for effective, gripping viewing, if only for purely morbid interest. The teen years, an age of revolt and insecurity in the best of conditions, can be shocking when an individual gets that carried away. This stark, muddled film depicts this, with reductive prurience indeed, but also with brutalizing efficacy.",The Basketball Diaries
19,videorama-759-859391,"Much more happening on the court, besides just basketball",8,7 May 2014,"The Basketball Diaries, is a harrowing journey, which in it's 102 minute time, we feel we've been to hell and back, it's final scene, where Jim Carrol had finally got his s..t together, reminiscent of the final scene in Stella Does Tricks, where like Jim, she addressed her young audience about her journey, through drugs and prostitution. This is the no holes barred look at the destruction of a man who had a talent for words, and what we've go through with him, is something we're glad we never endured. De Caprio shows us again here, what a brilliantly dramatic actor he is. There were moments he was so real, I was getting goosebumps. But we must give thanks to another great actor in the prime of his career, Underestimated ex Calvin Klein model, Mark Wahlberg. When not having seen the film for years, I forgot just how bloody good he was in this, almost on par with Leo, where as Jim's best friend, Mickey, saw him plummet harder with his drug addiction. Like Leo's, it's an engrossing performance. TBD is not for everyone, especially people easily affected by the drug scene, which as I said before, it's is a frank film on the subject. The dream sequence, that has Leo bursting into a classroom, opening fire on his friends, while letting out a howl of anger, was one of a couple of scenes that earned an R. It's a quite violent and frank scene, be warned. Of course, this notorious scene was the one suspected as the inspiration, or trigger for that very similar classroom shooting, two years later. The film really hones in on the desperation of that need, that fix for drugs, where money sometimes has to be earned in degrading ways. De Caprio fully embraced this role, like he does many others, although the film's well acted by everyone, especially Bracco as Jim's long suffering Mum you really feel for, and wish to hell she could help him, looking many years older than her younger self in Goodfellas. The film which has suffered some scathing reviews, which I myself believe, it could of been better, may'be stretched out to two hours, as to add some more input, to tell this tale of a hellish nightmare, where still like it is the film is bloody effective and poignant. Too, I found the film, besides being confronting, quite an entertaining view, due to Jim and his wild, but mostly funny exploits with his mates, which includes barfing on an innocent passenger below deck on a Statton Island ferry, the after effect of yes: meth sniffing. It good to see these troubled teens beat the odds, where only just learning of the demise of the gaunt faced Carroll, took me by surprise. Very recommended viewing.",The Basketball Diaries
20,freemantle_uk,A Grim Film,7,28 July 2008,"The Basketball Diaries is a competent, but faulted film. It is film which has Leonardo DiCaprio and Marc Walburg in early performances.The Basketball Diaries tells the story of four friends who play basketball for their high school team and like to spent their spare time taking drugs, especially heroin. As Basketball players their futures seem promising but they slowly decent into a life of sex and crime, ending up getting kicked out of there homes and out of school. They are forced to live on the streets of 1970s New York and hit rock bottom.The film is well made, and DiCaprio does give a good performance. I think it was a well directed film, really showing how bleck New York was and how bad drugs are. The film reminds of films like Thirteen, Trainspotting and Requiem for a Dream. However, my criticism of the film is there is no sympathetic character in film, and therefore, you don't truly sorry for any of them. This wasn't the case in the other films I mention.The Basketball Diaries is worth watching, but you don't have to knock-yourself out to see it.",The Basketball Diaries
21,juneebuggy,"Gritty, raw, imperfect and Wow from Leonardo DiCaprio",9,12 November 2014,"Not a perfect movie and I'm not sure how faithful it is to poet (Jim Carroll's) memoirs but worth watching for the remarkable performance from Leonardo DiCaprio. Just wow, absolutely raw and heart wrenching especially at the height of his addiction. I'd also forgotten that Mark Wahlberg is in this (very young Marky-Mark days) and also Juliette Lewis.The entire movie is very dark and inconsistent in its storytelling but filled with excellent performances; following Carroll (DiCaprio) as a 1960's teen, his star basketball days and subsequent spiral into heroin addiction along with a few of his school buddies. Crime, homelessness, prostitution and chaos ensue. 02.01.14 Quotes: ""First, it's a Saturday night thing when you feel cool like a gangster or a rockstar -just something to kill the boredom, you know?

24,Seraphion,One of the great first acting works from Leonardo DiCaprio,7,19 August 2014,"I like how the main theme of this movie kind of creeps in quite at the middle of it and then drastically emphasizes itself into a great conflict with the main character's own self. The other ideas of friendship and loss are also addressed nicely although with less emphasis and duration. The ending proves to be quite a good one, despite there is less footage of the process endured in the prison. From the acting side, I really like how Leonardo DiCaprio showed a great totality in acting here. He can really nail, although not perfectly, all the physical conditions a junkie with demanding addiction would do. Mark Wahlberg acted out also quite a nice performance, despite the posture of his body quite nags. How can a high school age kid have a bodybuilder's chest and abs like that?",The Basketball Diaries
25,Movie-ManDan,"It's A Bit Unoriginal, But The Raw Power This Possesses Makes Up For It All.",10,25 November 2017,"Among all the actors that have influenced me over the years, Leonardo DiCaprio dates back the farthest. Every time I see him in a movie, I'm completely amazed. After his breakout film ""What's Eating Gilbert Grape"" brought him into the limelight, this film took him up a notch. It is arguably Leo's best pre-Titanic role.The Basketball Diaries is an autobiographical look into the life of Jim Carroll. Jim was a New York teenager who enjoyed horsing around and aspired to be a basketball star. Jim's environment sucks: his neighbourhood is full of poor wackos, his mother is poor, his best friend is dying or leukaemia, and his high school consists of priests and normal teachers who are physically and sexually abusive. Jim and his pals are at a boiling point. As they just want to have fun and escape the horrors around them the craziest in Jim's entourage, Mickey (played by Marky Mark) gets them a hold of drugs. Jim soon finds himself addicted with life spiralling out of control.So this is pretty formulaic: a youth with all the potential in the world escapes harsh realities by turning to drugs and hits rock bottom. But what makes this different and better than most is raw power. I started this review raving about DiCaprio's performance. He really is that good, one of his best. He is able to show such an enormous range starting with a smart teenager and ending as a junkie near death. He doesn't switch gears into the different stages of Jim's fall, he gradually flows. That's something no other young actor had the talent to do. It is so special and is so rare for anybody in anymore to tackle. No matter the stage in Jim's life, Leo plays him with such conviction. That's why this remains one of Leo's best. I know many people still rave about ""Gilbert Grape"" being Leo's best, but this is actually far superior. Arnie Grape was really a one-note character with little range and a small outpour of emotion.The supporting cast keeps this from being a bad movie with a great performance. This was one of Mark Wahlberg's first movies and he nails it. Ernie Hudson has a bit part as Jim's neighbour and he's awesome. And this is Lorraine Bracco's best role other than ""Goodfellas.""The directing is also impressive. The farther Jim descends, the more filming changes and the more cinematography does. I know Martin Scorsese did this in ""Goodfellas,"" but The Basketball Diaries does it all in different ways.Every aspect is full of overwhelming emotion and natural raw power, keeping this from being just another drug picture.4/4",The Basketball Diaries
26,rosscinema,Familiar story with strong performance,5,27 November 2003,"They're have been many films made about characters getting involved with drugs and the stories have become familiar so I have to look to see if any of them have a special quality to recommend them. I don't think this film has that special quality but it does present the viewer with a very strong performance by its star. This is the true story about Jim Carroll (Leonardo DiCaprio) who is a teenager in New York City and the star of his high school basketball team. He goes to a catholic school but definitely does not behave like a good catholic. He hangs out with his friends Mickey (Mark Wahlberg), Neutron (Patrick McGaw) and Pedro (James Madio) and they like to experiment with popping pills and using inhalants. In his spare time Jim writes in his diary about his everyday events and the people in his life. One night while partying with some rich girls he experiments with cocaine for the first time and it doesn't take long before he is using hardcore drugs on a daily basis. During a game Jim passes out and his coach Swifty (Bruno Kirby) kicks him off the team and he and Mickey quit school. Jim's mother (Lorraine Bracco) can't deal with him in this state and kicks him out of their home so now he is living on the streets with Mickey. They rob stores and steal cars to feed their habit until Jim is passed out in the snow. A friend named Reggie (Ernie Hudson) finds him and takes him back to his apartment where he forces Jim to quit cold turkey. After a rocky ordeal for a few days Jim sneaks out and meets Mickey where they try and score in a park. They get ripped off and chase the dealer to the top of a building and during a scuffle with Mickey he is pushed over the edge where he falls and dies. After getting beaten up by the locals in the neighborhood Mickey is hauled off by the police. Jim heads to his mothers and begs for money but she doesn't give him any and the police later catch up with him there. This film is directed by Scott Kalvert who is making his debut in feature films and the only thing he had directed before this was the video ""The Marky Mark Workout"" and at times while watching this film I had the notion that the material may be over his head. At times this film does have a strong visual style but as a director his storytelling is pretty basic. This is your familiar story about someone getting involved with drugs and it doesn't really offer anything that you haven't seen in other films about this subject. A lot of the blame comes from Jim Carroll himself and its because survivors of drug addiction love to think that they have something special to offer the world. Don't get me wrong, its great if he can stop individuals from entering a life of hell but for most of us that sort of information is unnecessary and it certainly doesn't equate into a good film. Kalvert does do one thing correctly that enhances the film, he allows DiCaprio the freedom to submerge himself into this character and the camera at times lingers on his face as he wallows in his grotesque state. Some have said that DiCaprio is miscast but I disagree. DiCaprio with his youthful appearance was certainly believable as a teenager and this is a very strong performance. The scene where he is crying by the front door begging for money from his mother is one that is not quickly forgotten. Juliette Lewis has a small role as the hooker Diane and she is also pretty good. I think they're are much better films dealing with this subject and even though I can't really recommend it I do think that the performance of DiCaprio would be the only reason that curious viewers might want to check it out.",The Basketball Diaries
27,RainDogJr,"""don't forget this fact, you can't get it back""",9,21 February 2011,"Ever since hearing the commentary track of Paul Thomas Anderson for the Boogie Nights DVD (I heard it like in early 2008), this title, Scott Kalvert's The Basketball Diaries, came to stay in my mind. I really love the way P.T. Anderson, like Tarantino or now Edgar Wright, talks about his influences, about film in general, and in this case after hearing that he cast Mark Walhberg after seeing his performance in The Basketball Diaries (""god, he was good, god, I though he was so good"" – and Mark made sure P.T. Anderson wanted him for his acting and not for his body!) definitely made me want to check it out (I Am Cuba is another of the titles that stayed with me thanks to that commentary. I still have to watch it tough). And P.T. Anderson explains that actually his first choice for that part was Leonardo DiCaprio. He doesn't specify, but it's very probable that DiCaprio became his choice also due to The Basketball Diaries (however he decided to do Titanic instead). Anyway, there is not a R4 DVD around that I know, so it was until some weeks ago, when I found on ebay a really cheap R1 DVD of it, when I sort of recall everything and finally got it. When you see a movie with the title of ""The Basketball Diaries"" and a very young DiCaprio, I mean, a young blonde kid in school clothes in its DVD cover you may not think of it as something really interesting. Definitely you don't think of it as a strong movie about the consequences of drug addiction. This is a movie that deals with the downfall of some very talented young basketball players. It has few to offer for those seeking for a straight sports movie though. We learn that our characters really can play basketball, and pretty much that's it. This is really a straight drug movie. And it's a really good one even though it doesn't really add something ""brand-new"" to the drug movie sort of formula (but we probably have here the basketball game with the most doped players. That scene features the Doors' ""Riders on the Storm"", which is pretty cool indeed). My sort of analogy goes with the thing that DiCaprio became like a different actor once he began working with Martin Scorsese back in 2002. He definitely left Titanic behind. Maybe before Scorsese but hell, since Gangs of New York I, at least, see a different DiCaprio. So here in The Basketball Diaries we have like the two DiCaprio. The movie at first sight is a coming of age one with the Titanic DiCaprio suffering the type of education that his Catholic school gives but also having fun with his friends (all are part of a great Catholic basketball team that is pretty much invincible) and stuff; it's a ""kids being kids"" kind of story. Once the movie gets much darker we get to see the Scorsese DiCaprio. Somehow some scenes really make see the very intense DiCaprio from the Scorsese films. It was a surprise to have him here doing something like that, two years before Titanic (I have yet to see What's Eating Gilbert Grape, for which he earned his first Oscar nomination back in 1994). This is worth watching stuff.",The Basketball Diaries
28,raulfaust,People as they are,8,11 November 2010,"Again, a movie based on a book having many differences and hiding things because of conservatism (to not say hypocrisy) in our society.Despite that, the movie runs real fast and we enjoy every second of it. DiCaprio performance's here beats Titanic's easily. We are able to collect his disturbed feelings in an unbelievable way, we are able to see how things were in his way of life and what it would feels like if we were in his situation.We are able to see people helping each other with nothing in return, like Roogie did for him. It was an humanistic and unselfish act from Roogie that we should follow in our lives for a better place to live.Not 10/10 because of Hollywood's eternal question involving police.

29,Easygoer10,Very Good Biography/Film,9,21 April 2019,"I like the casting. DiCaprio is brilliant, and Mark Wahlberg as well. Juliette Lewis is perfect, as well as Ernie Hudson. Bruno Kirby is terrific as the sexually deviant (child molester) basketball coach.On the downside, the screenplay is far from what Jim Carroll wrote. As a reformed hard core opiate addict myself, I truly know exactly what Carroll felt. For me, the best scene is when Jim (DiCaprio) is dope-sick outside his mother's door; what he immediately realizes is his former home. The worst? The first time he shoots heroin. Except for the ""warm feeling"" (an oral description), it so much more than what is shown on the screen.For me, especially very strong pharmaceutical opiates (and heroin), were like a warm blanket settling all over me. Plus having sex, shooting a machine gun, and screaming through all the gears to red line in a Ferrari; the mid-engine roaring right behind your head: all at the same time! That is what it feels like; the first few times. Eventually it gets worse; worse than anyone can possibly imagine; who has not lived (or died) through withdrawals, as I have.Jim Carroll, who wrote the autobiography this film is based upon, got clean and became very famous as a writer (for a while); he is cast in the film, too. Andy Warhol took him under his wing, which is what helped his career; enormously. Unfortunately, Carroll died at age 60. All things considered, not bad. I am almost 65, and should have died over 35 years ago. I am grateful.",The Basketball Diaries

See it if you want, and really not a big lose if you don't.4 stars",The Basketball Diaries
32,Screen_Blitz,"Powerful, but not as effective as other anti-drug movies",6,6 September 2015,"In this biopic based on true events, Leonardo Dicaprio stars in his first leading role as Jim Carroll, a high school teen in Manhattan who plays on the basketball team along with his friends Mickey (played by Mark Wahlberg), Neutron (played by Patrick McGaw), and Pedro (played by James Madio). The four begin sprawling the streets of downtown Manhattan, experimenting with illegal drugs and prostitution. Soon, they begin experimenting with heroin, which unexpectedly grows into an addiction. Before too long, their lives begin descending into a downward spiral when their addiction takes a toll on their high school career as well as their home lives.Many anti-drug movies such as Trainspotting (1996) and Requiem For a Dream (2000), succeed on painting realistic pictures on how drug addiction damages people's lives as well as deliver clear messages on why you shouldn't do drugs. This one does manage to give an authentic look on drug addiction with the main character. When you watch as he and his friends steadily transcend into a life of heroin addiction, they get involved with crime including robbery, theft, assault, and eventually homicide. They also end up getting kicked off the basketball team, expelled from school, and even exiled from the comfort of their homes. The movie does do a decent job at highlighting the perplexities that their drug addiction leads to. The main problem however is that the story pays very little emotional investment, and it makes the plot less effective than it should be, not to say that it fails to deliver its message. Aside from this, as the story approaches its final act, the film goes into some rather strange directions. For instance, one of the characters leaves the group not wanting to grow further into the heroin addiction. From there on out, we never learn what happens to him or what. Then there are some drug-charged hallucination scenes like the infamous school shooting scene and a scene showing Leonardo Dicaprio's character get shot while shooting a basketball that made almost no sense.Overall, Basketball Diaries is not too bad for a film. Even though it may not be as effective or believable as other drug-themed movies, it still manages to be somewhat powerful and deliver its message. The cast also deliver some good performances, especially Mark Wahlberg.",The Basketball Diaries
33,Jeremy_Urquhart,Good direction and acting let down by a disappointing screenplay.,6,8 May 2019,"Something about this movie felt off to me, and I think it has to be the writing, because it was well-shot and featured a good performance by a very young Leonardo Dicaprio, as well as solid/serviceable performances by the rest of the talented cast.
The film itself, however, moves along awkwardly, with most developments in the plot feeling very rushed, and all the events tied together in a very disjointed way. I appreciate that perhaps this was intentional, to show how quickly one can get addicted to heroin- and the fractured state of the story's progression may owe to it being based off ""diary"" entries, as alluded to in the film's title. Yet this doesn't make for a satisfying or believable story told on screen, even before considering the rather absurd fact that heroin isn't even introduced to any of the characters until well over half an hour of time has passed.
There's also the under-utilisation of talented actors like Lorraine Bracco and Ernie Hudson, as well as an unnecessary sub-plot of the main character's coach being a pedophile, but these are less significant complaints overall.
Oh, and the ending is rather abrupt and unsatisfying too.
There exist far better drug movies out there- Requiem For A Dream and Trainspotting being two of the most well-known, but I'd highly recommend the German film Christiane F. for its comparable depiction of teenagers becoming addicted to heroin. It does so in a much more credible, haunting, memorable, and narratively satisfying manner.",The Basketball Diaries

35,KnightsofNi11,Lacks in some areas but makes up for it in others,7,10 August 2010,"What is rock bottom? Everyone has their notion of what rock bottom means, but the general consensus is when your life just can't go any lower. This idea is subjective to the individual so take your own definition of ""rock bottom"" then multiply it by 10. Now you have the depravity and tragedy of Jim Carroll, the person who The Basketball Diaries is based on. This movie tells the story of Jim Carroll in his teenage years as he deals with rapidly growing drug addiction. It begins with him and his basketball team, one of the most important things in his life. He has some wild friends whose judgment might not be the best, another friend who is dying of leukemia, and a teacher who isn't very fond of him. Regardless, his future still looks promising. But as the story progresses, Jim and his friends sink deeper and deeper into addiction. His life falls to pieces around him as everyone he thought cared about him turn on him one by one. It makes for a depressing and brutal look at real life.The story here is a difficult one that only gets sadder as it progresses. Everything only gets worse and worse, with no uplifting catharsis anywhere along the line. The tone of the film can be represented by a line that slopes downward the entire length. Jim's life stoops to such depressing lows and his drug addiction puts him in situations I could never imagine being in. It is a different kind of life with so few boundaries and rules that he and his friends basically run rampant throughout the streets of New York. I wasn't entirely sure of the directors intentions with this film. I couldn't tell whether I was supposed to sympathize with Jim and his friends or not. The bleak look at this reality makes one feel sympathy and sorrow for these unfortunate characters, yet at the same time everything that happens to them was brought about by their own actions. It is here that I question just how much sympathy I can feel for a group of teenagers with such poor judgment. I can't help but think that they had it coming. But like I said, they live in a different world where their actions are not judged as harshly by the people around them and they must learn for themselves the difference between right and wrong, all through personal experience. It is human nature to make mistakes, and Jim Carroll and his friends make their fair share in The Basketball Diaries. It is a debate that will rage for centuries, but for now I'll have to move on.Looking past the emotional intentions of the film, it is technically well made and merits praise in many areas. The film is gritty and realistic, and the actors do a fine job at portraying these elements. My opinion of Leonardo DiCaprio has changed over the years. When he entered the Hollywood scene he was quickly type-casted as the romantic prettyboy, fulfilling this stereotype in films such as Titanic (1997) and Romeo + Juliet (1996). As he has grown older and matured, I have gained much more respect for him. His recent roles like Martin Scorsese's pictures The Departed (2006) and Shutter Island (2010) both amazed me. His most recent role in Inception (2010) was also exceptional. The Basketball Diaries was released in 1996, during his prettyboy phase. Yet this one stands out and he plays a much different character. In this film we see DiCaprio in a much different light than Titanic or Romeo + Juliet when we watch snot run down his face with tears in his eyes as he begs and begs for drugs. He fits the role very well, and it is almost because of his prettyboy reputation that it is so tragic to see him stoop so low. The supporting cast does a great job here as well, such as the flamboyantly angry Mark Wahlberg (Three Kings, Boogie Nights) filling his ever aggravated typecast role. The direction stands out in some scenes more than others but it is very good nonetheless. There are some odd dream sequences that break the flow of the film, yet I never found myself losing touch with it or getting overly distracted. There's nothing that truly holds The Basketball Diaries back from being a fine film.This movie provides a harsh look into reality, so be prepared to have one mans depression beat into you with one harrowing scene after another. The Basketball Diaries is not delivered without issues, but it is a well made and well acted film with its fair share of gritty insight into reality.",The Basketball Diaries
36,rainking_es,Another heroin-addict diary...,7,22 August 2004,"When you've watched plenty of movies based on some drug-addict life story you can't help compare them... I mean, the story is always the same: a guy begins having drugs for fun, or because he's boring, or just because he's young and wants to try new experiences, then he gets hooked, starts to rob or to prostitute himself, and eventually ends up in prison. That's what we see in Christiane F., El Pico, Trainspotting, Drugstore Cowboy... There may be differences in the form, and in the characters, but the content is always the same. The dinstictive feature of Basketball Diaries is that the main character actually exists: Jim Carroll, a writer-singer-performer born in NYC in the 50's. And this is supposed to be his autobiography (or the cinema adaptation of some diaries he wrote when he was a teenager, heroin-addicted). Because of that, Basketball D. is more poetic than the rest of the movies I named before, the voice over of DiCaprio's character is present all along the film, telling us about his thoughts (rather nihilistic's) , with a style near to Burroughs or Jack Kerouac, urban poetry, tough and without ornament. Maybe that's the strong point of Basketball Diaries, because movies such as Christiane F. or El Pico recreates much better what it means to be a drug-addict, they're much more explicit, more dirty, much harder...
DiCaprio's performance deserves a new paragraph, 'cause it's simply astonishing. His best performance EVER, plenty of different shades.

DiCaprio is pretty good in the lead role of Jim Caroll, although he had some problems with the drug scenes (especially the first one) and the basketball scenes (he played like he sucked), other than that his performance was pretty good. The film had a great supporting cast, with Lorraine Bracco shining as his mother and Mark Wahlberg, Bruno Kirby and James Madio were all great in their roles, as well as Michael Rapaport, who stole his single scene from DiCaprio. The problem I had was that the film was not the most realistic, although a lot of the stuff it did portray I can either relate to or have seen go on in my high school (not exactly the most safe environment, California high schools or NY...). The direction was good keeping it interesting at most times, but i felt the screenplay was a bit weak and especially in the 3rd act it fell apart, although the ending was a bit cliché, it still helped as it rescued the 3rd act which seemed to be going nowhere.

If it wasnt for the run of the mill script, this could have been a very powerful film, unfortunately, its doesnt reach its potential due to that.  I mean its watchable, but dont expect to be blown away or anything.  The supporting cast is superb though, Lorraine Braco(Goodfellas), Bruno Kirby(City Slikers), Mark Wahlberg(Boogie Nights), Ernie Hudson(Ghostbusters), and Juliette Lewis(Cape Fear, From Dusk Till Dawn) all give impressive performances.  Im still going to give it a 6, because DiCaprio gave a great performance, and I liked the actors.  Star rating:**1/2 out of ****",The Basketball Diaries

The end scene on the stage is badly staged. No pun intended. It's a bit awkward, but it's easily forgivable.The ugly.

It seems to have a fairly distant relationship to Carroll's own story.Jim Carroll (Leonardo DiCaprio) is part of a small group of teenage guys at a Catholic high school. His best friend, Bobby (Michael Imperioli), has terminal leukemia. Other friends include Mickey (Mark Wahlberg), Pedro (James Madio), and Neutron (Patrick McGaw). His single mother (Lorraine Bracco) struggles to hold things together. The basketball coach (Bruno Kirby) is an in-the-closet gay man who pursues Jim. Jim constantly records his thoughts and unfolding events in booklets, often in poetic language.The guys get into increasing trouble with small thefts and teenage shenanigans until they begin to get hooked on pills. After accidentally taking downers instead of uppers, Jim, Mickey, and Pedro get thrown out of school. Neutron resists the pill culture and goes on to become a high school All-American basketball player. The three guys then begin to use heroin and become increasingly addicted.The film follows their descent into legal trouble, efforts by acquaintances to help them, and a very short ""explanation"" at the end of how Jim escapes addiction and begins to share his poetry publicly.The film is interesting mostly as one of Leonardo DiCaprio's earlier films. In my view, he actually does a good job, but the screenplay and direction are quite wanting. There are quick cuts from scene to scene, and outside of DiCaprio's character, the rest are quite limited.This movie is quite a downer because of its nature and the quick ""positive"" ending. And in my view, it doesn't do as good a job of portraying descent into addiction as a film like ""Panic in Needle Park.""",The Basketball Diaries
46,smakawhat,ahh.. torturous youth...,6,30 April 2000,"This is the true life story of a poet/musician named Jim Caroll played by Leo (never heard of him), and his time being a drug abuser/heroin addict as a teenager going to Catholic school.  Jim is a promising basketball player.  His school team is one of the best in the city.  However, as Jim slides into the typical rebeliousness of teen adolescence, he and his chums start getting into the usual experimentation with drugs.  But when one of Jim's buddies who has been suffering from lukemia dies, he can't handle it and slowly but surely, ends up spirialing out of control. Jim's life is filed with angst, a basketball coach who makes sexual advances towards him, and a cold institution that offers him no guidance.  The film is OK, Leo is good in it and so are the other actors.  However, Leo's portrayl of a heroin abuser is overshadowed by the fact that he still looks like a pretty boy.  I have seen what hardcore heroin users look like, and even though they throw makeup on Leo to enhance the affects it still doesn't pay off.  This the third ""heroin"" abuse movie that I have seen and the other 2 I saw were certainly better.  But you did get the sense of kids trying to find an identity for themselves and yet having no direction.  Everyone can identify with that. As for the so called ""shooting"" controversy.  It is soooo ridiculous that people would consider this movie the culprit for the Columbine shootings. If anything those kids had the brains to watch this movie and have some intelligence in seeing an independent film, that portrays what REALLY happens to teenagers if they start doing drugs, instead of seeing some typical Hollywood drivel.  If anything the film is a powerful lesson for kids.  But the shooters probably didn't have the intelligence to comprehend it. Rating 6 out of 10.",The Basketball Diaries
47,Gunnar_Runar_Ingibjargarson,One of the most powerful movie I've seen in my life,8,17 June 2008,"The PR-Titanic Leonardo DiCaprio stars as Jim Carroll, the poet and musician who spent much of his adolescence addicted to heroin and shooting hoops with fellow Catholic high school kids. As a biography, the film doesn't amount to more than the sum of its gritty scenes of smack use, violence, perversions (poor Bruno Kirby plays a lecherous coach who comes on to young Jim), and the usual scream-and-puke dramas that go along with a cold-turkey session. Director Scott Kalvert doesn't seem to realize that most people don't know who Carroll is and therefore can't possibly understand why they should care about his gutter ball youth. DiCaprio, having nowhere to go with his performance but maintain Carroll's tailspin, is boring and redundant. Some kind of allusion to the literary and rock & roll life that follows the mess we're watching might have been helpful.",The Basketball Diaries

I think this is the best his role to date. This movie will keep interested to the end. Althau there are some unpleasant scenes. The first half of a movie was about Jim Carroll's first drug experiences, the second half was mainly about how he is slowly killing himself and there were a lot of unpleasant scenes. What is good about this film is that there were shown how do people become a drug addicts(the first times usually come from curiosity and curiosity is one of humans main feature, so it's pretty natural, but some people stop after they satisfy their curiosity, some don't usually because they have trouble in their personal life and it's easier to ignore those problems this way). There should be more those kind of movies because you can learn a lot from them. People don't start doing drugs because their life is so wonderful so if you want to fight drugs you have to deal the reasons why people start doing drugs. And the addicts can't be blamed for that because society made them this way. Everyone is addicted to something and the only difference is that some addictions are acceptable for society.",The Basketball Diaries

I like most movies that ends with a moral without being preachy about it, especially against drugs, and this is one of them.

Pretty decent camera shots and quality of film especially for the time. Every shot and scene seems to be done with meaning and purpose.Story:
This being based of a true story makes it even more of a hit to the gut. From beginning to end its filled with interesting characters and story. You follow a group of boys through good times, funny moments and then as their lives start to crumble further into the story so does your mood and hope for their future. This is definitely a emotional story that builds up and shows hardships Leo's character faces. It includes pedophilia, drug addiction, loss of friendship, death and more. The end was nice but ended quite suddenly and randomly. Some parts in the film did seem a bit unrealistic as well. But overall the story hit hard and was done well.Summary:
This film tells a emotional tale of some hard times kids can face in life. It's not the best I've seen. But for me it definitely was a really good movie. I would highly suggest it if your into your emotional movies. 7.5/10 for me.",The Basketball Diaries

Often people forget, that there also was a pre-""Titanic""-DiCaprio when they discuss his acting skills. In director Scott Kalvert's ""The Basketball Diaries"" he plays Jim Carroll, who attends a catholic school in New York. But you soon will notice, that in real it is a movie about drug addiction and the big danger this is for teenagers. Around the turn of the millennium we have seen some great films that deal with drug addiction and I think this one was one of the forerunners, because in it's style it reminded me on the films of Darren Aronofsky and Paul Thomas Anderson, at least in a few scenes. What ""The Basketball Diaries"" shows best of all recent drug movies is how a young person gets into drug addiction in passing.

55,nikitalinivenko,DiCaprio's Low-Point,1,20 October 2019,"The biggest joke about all this is that originally River Phoenix was to star before he OD'd. This movie begins as a white people version of Cooley High, and eventually degrades down to a white people version of Juice. It's the most standard, bland, obligatory ""Don't do Drugs"" after school special, reminiscent of that god-awful 1987 adaptation of Less Than Zero with Robert Downey Jr. as a heroin addict. Seriously, instead of a two-hour movie, this could've been a thirty-second TV commercial with Nancy Reagan, and it wouldn't have made any difference. This cheap street product of a movie is based on a pretty mediocre autobiography (any junky can write a book) that was instantly forgettable, just like this screen adaptation. There have been significantly better novels on heroin addiction (Trainspotting, Requiem for a Dream, Almost Transparent Blue - two of which were adapted into iconic works a million times better than this) and DiCaprio's acting here just felt like watching a high-schooler portray a junky they saw on a TV show. A forgettable wasted afternoon with nothing that hasn't been done better elsewhere.",The Basketball Diaries
56,AZINDN,Playing Hard Ball,8,16 March 2006,"If Leonardo di Caprio had not already made this film, he would be cast immediately for the role of lifetime. Leo's performance as the lanky, audacious, and attitude-heavy high school star basketball player is a descent to heroin-hell with the story of author, Jim Carroll. It can only be described as a superb performance. As often as di Caprio is cited for his Titanic performance, it is ""Basketball Diaries"" that showcase his earlier star quality in a resume of fine, solid performance. With cameras in streets of lower Manhattan, the junkie life of a street urchin is neither fun nor games, it is pathos and crime. Teenies who flock to the di Caprio film library should see ""Basketball Diaries"" as a point of information. When the glamor and veneer of heroin and cocaine wear off, what is left is Jim frothing at the mouth, twisting, and screaming in pain as he undergoes a cold turkey rehabilitation program by his friend, Ernie Hudson. Additional violence in a fantasy sequence has Jim with shotgun in hand killing a class room of students from his high school and the priest teacher may be the source of ""Jeremy"" but it is perhaps too problematic for younger audiences and sensitive adults.In a too brief cameo appearance, the author recites poetry of haiku grace about his own speeding raps and heroin nods in memories of Catholic ceremony, a chilling monologue filled with irony as the real Jim Carroll is cooking up to fix while he speaks to di Caprio as a younger version of himself. These fine performances from the young supporting cast include thuggish ""Marky"" Mark Walberg, and Soprano regulars, Michael Imperiolli, Max Cassella, and a heart wrenching performance by Lorraine Bracco as Jim's mother who can do nothing for her son but call the police on him. Each makes ""Basketball Diaries"" worthy of everyone's attention with this hard perspective on the glamorous 'game' of heroin chic.",The Basketball Diaries

I quickly glanced at someone else's review where they said that this is so much better than ""Requiem for a Dream"" and I could not agree more.""The Basketball Diaries"" shows four friends and how they all react to drugs becoming part of their lives. DiCaprio's character really gives his struggles a human feel with his diary used as a narration. Speaking of DiCaprio, he has a breakout performance in this film which helped to propel him to the mega star that he is today. And rightfully so; he does a wonderful job playing the strung-out, desperate character of Jim. Mark Wahlberg is also very good in one of his early roles.The movie has heart with the characters of Bobby, Reggie, and Jim's mother.

Leo plays Jim Carroll, a high school student with a love of basketball and a flare for writing whose life goes right down the toilet when he becomes a heroine addict. Yes, perhaps Leo gets hooked a little too quickly but everything that happens to him after he gets hooked is totally real. Along with CLEAN AND SOBER, this movie so clearly and honestly demonstrates where drug addiction can take you...how nothing else becomes important but how and where that next high is coming from. There is one harrowing scene after another here. We see Jim returning to his mother (Lorraine Bracco) after being kicked out of the house and we see Jim turn from begging child to threatening thug in a matter of seconds, a scene brilliantly performed by DiCaprio. We see Jim and his friends beat up an old lady for her purse and we even see Jim prostitute himself with a man in order to get money. It's a frightening and realistic spiral downward that Jim takes and he does make it back, but it is important to remember when watching this film that a lot don't. DiCaprio gets solid support from future star Mark Wahlberg, Bruno Kirby, Jr., Juliette Lewis, and Michael Imperioli.

While no film can really impress on an audience the horror that is a heroin addiction, this film is probably the closest thing I've seen. It comes dangerously close in parts to crossing the line from ""anti"" to ""pro"", but never does in my opinion.My feelings on Leo are mixed. He's got talent, but he's been in some truly awful films. If you ever need to convince someone of his acting talents though, don't show them the scene where he confronts his mother at the apartment door. Show them the one in ""Winky and Blinky's"" apartment, where he goes to the medicine cabinet and takes an assortment of drugs, then looks straight into the camera. Might not look it but that's an incredibly hard thing to do, a straight-to-camera look with no dialogue. It's just one example of the awesome performance he gives in this film (without even realising it, it seems like) Only slight niggle i have is the ending. It wrapped up too quickly and cleanly. After all those years of degradation it comes across as him getting over it all very quickly, which doesn't happen with heroin. I guess they had to jump ahead in time for the film though. Having seen the film I want to read the book, but its been out of print for some time.

Carroll and his group of friends are nothing more than a gang of thugs who do nothing but bad things and this eventually leads him down the path of destruction.Carroll must fend off his overbearing and malicious teacher who seems to get pleasure out of taking the paddle to him in front of the rest of his classmates and his still-in-the-closet basketball coach who propositions him in a matter that had surely been done to others before. Add to this the fact that he recently lost one of his best friends, mis-communication with his mother and the ever so inducing world of drugs that takes him in like so many before.I enjoyed this film because of the great performances by DiCaprio and the supporting cast. Each had a great tone of realism to make the film feel that much more as if it were taking place right in front of you.I would recommend this film to anyone who has become desensitized to overly violent films that have more to prove than just blood and guts.

Even though the movie is nowhere close when it comes to being faithful to Jim Carroll's fantastic novel, I still regard it as one of the most important movies I've ever seen (and Carroll's novel my favourite book).Even though the movie made up 80% (if not 90%) of Carroll's life, its anti-drugs message is still strongly and powerfully delivered. Unlike ""Traffic"", the most recent anti-drug movie, ""Diaries"" is carefully-paced, interesting and most importantly, it speaks directly to the audience. DiCaprio's Carroll (or the film version) is someone who has to sacrifice his dream -- which is to become a basketball player -- to feed his seemingly never-ending hunger to get high. ""Diaries"" is not only a movie for non-junkies; it is also a movie for drug addicts. DiCaprio's astounding withdrawal scene is the one you're likely to remember out of the whole thing, and I think it provides a mirror for drug abusers to look into, to see how crap they really look.(mild spoiler) Anyone who's seen this movie should know that drug addiction would pretty much screw up a person's life. Although Carroll -- both the film version and the real-life figure -- came out of it a stronger person, not everyone has it in them to completely kick their habit. Example: Mickey (Mark Wahlberg) has to use his life to pay for a drastic and irreversible action that happened on a whim of fury, when he got cheated by a drug-seller, and Pedro is still on heroin even after reform camp. (end spoiler) ""Diaries"" is both touching and sad, but more importantly, it's powerful.Leonardo DiCaprio was perfect as Jim Carroll, if not a little scrawny for a basketball player. I regard Leonardo, along with Joaquin Phoenix, as the finest actor of his generation, and it's not hard to know why. I read a comment here that said he overacted during the scene outside his mom's apartment. Well, I beg to differ. How else was he supposed to act under such extreme desperation? DiCaprio's wailings and whinings were spot-on, 'cause that is exactly how *I* sound when I cry (and I mean, REALLY cry). That scene was the most memorable one for me, followed by his withdrawal scene, which I felt was worth the price of the DVD alone. DiCaprio looked disgusting with drool all over his face which was bloodied earlier on, and it was completely effective. Mark Wahlberg, Patrick McGaw and James Madio all gave strong support, but the star here is really DiCaprio.To reiterate: ""The Basketball Diaries"" is one of the most important movies I've seen, and the book is one of the best and also important I've read.

Jim Carroll, played by Leonardo DiCaprio, is a catholic schoolboy who gets in over his head with drugs, and does not look back. The film itself is great, and the screenplay adaption seems to not miss a beat. This film marks the beginning of a new generations of very talented actors. Mark Wahlberg, Julliette Lewis, and DiCaprio himself all proved that they could handle mature, complicated roles like these. The directing was also on par with the acting lending to the story almost like an actor in itself. The appropriate cinematography brings the viewer closer to the type of life that Carroll and his friends lead through the grimy streets of the Manhattan underworld. It is a shame that Scott Kalvert used this film to show the peak of his talent, instead of as a launching point to his career. He has offered us ""Dueces Wild"" following this extremely brave and well polished effort, which is sub-par if respectable at all.

The movie itself is a pretty interesting view into the world of drugs and their ultimate impact on a young person's life.  Do not be fooled, though, by any mention of this being the story of Jim Carroll's life or even a factual account of his Basketball Diaries.  Sure, there are some similarities, but overall, the director took a lot of artistic liberties with this movie. Regardless, The Basketball Diaries is still a realistic representation of ""street kids"" and drug use.The movie can be boring at times, but Dicaprio draws you in nevertheless and inspires you to keep watching.  Overall, I believe it's worth it.  There are a few especially incredible scenes that are well worth the time in watching the movie.  One of which includes the friends basketball-in-the-rain game after the loss of a friend.Most likely, had a less charismatic and talented actor taken on the role of Jim Carroll, The Basketball Diaries wouldn't have been nearly as entertaining as it was.

But the movie itself has lots of flaws. First off, the screenplay sucks. I didn't sympathize with the main character at all. The movie tries to tell you that if you do drugs you could as well be throwing your future away, but truth is, the kids in this movie have been throwing their future away before they even do drugs.And what's with one of their friends' sudden change of behavior? Out of a sudden he's telling his friends not to do drugs? What's the reason? And what's with the scene where Jim begs Diane for money? Now Diane's suddenly clean and sober? How?Actually, Leo's performance is the ONLY thing that makes this movie worth watching. Everything else about it sucks (well, pretty much).",The Basketball Diaries
74,shafatqadri,Basketball Rocks!!!!!!!,8,12 October 2008,"I have this uncanny love for dark and disturbing movies and had my eye long on 'The Basketball Diaries'. So finally watched it last weekend. This is Leonardo Di Caprio's one of the early movie and the most under rated one in terms of the performance.""The Basketball Diaries"" is a lurid and uncompromising study of how drug addiction can destroy lives. The film has been ignored or underrated because many people would find it unwatchable. The protagonist's decline into the lowest of society could hardly be made more graphic. Leonardo DiCaprio stars as Jim Carroll, a Catholic high school student and basketball star. He is also a would-be poet, scribbling essays in a journal that he jealously guards. Jim's risk-taking, anti-social behavior and drug abuse soon leads to the destruction of his life. Quitting school and leaving home, he turns to hard-core criminal acts to get money for his next fix. He has little understanding of his situation, no desire to overcome his habits, and the only question is will he end up in prison or in a morgue.Leonardo DiCaprio's performance is downright jaw-dropping. Words can really not do justice to the work that he does in this film. His tortured, honest and stunningly natural portrayal is in the same caliber as James Dean of yesteryears. He doesn't act according to the page. He pulls his deepest emotions out and spatters them across the screen, providing us with scenes that will shake us up and lead us to feel Jim's pain. Not only is the representation of drug addiction perfectly depicted, but the emotional complexity of the character as well. We see this young man for what he is  tormented, hopelessly confused and fiercely searching for answers that he will never be given.If you have the stomach for this sort of movie, you will be rewarded. There are many outstanding scenes, such as Jim attempting to cheer up friend and leukemia patient Bobby, and Jim trying to play basketball while on downers.Perhaps the scene most difficult to get through has Jim pleading to his mother (Lorraine Bracco) to give him money for a fix. His mother has locked the door on him, unable to trust her own son, and sobs uncontrollably over what he has become.An uncompromising script and a solid performance from Leonardo Di Caprio help make 'The Basketball Diaries' a powerful and memorable film experience",The Basketball Diaries
75,Karok-2,Good acting,7,21 April 2000,"Leonardo DiCaprio plays a great role, that should make him an important actor. But of course, he is just the cute guy for teenager girls, and that has sure affected on his decisions about acting.I just have to say that this movie is a movie that teenagers should see for learning about drugs, and how they can destroy many lifes. Not just the guys or girls, also the families of this people. And this movie it has just been ignored. And also I think it has a great screenplay.",The Basketball Diaries
76,porazzim42,Holy S***,8,6 February 2009,"DiCaprio gave what I thought was one of the best performances of his career! The scene where he is going through withdrawal not only scared me to death the first time I saw it, but still gives me goosebumps as I watch it over and over again. And the scene where he begs his mother for money still brings me to tears. He is stunning. Truly one of the best.Another wonderful performance is Lorraine Bracco, the actress you played Jim's mother. She was wonderful as the lost mother who didn't know how to help her son. Juliette Lewis was good in the role of the prostitute. This role is perfect for her because she always sounds high anyway. Mark Wahlberg was okay as Mickey and Bruno Kirby was chilling as the pedophile.",The Basketball Diaries
77,andrewtowne-1,What an incredible movie! Di Caprio leaves other actors in the dust.,10,27 January 2009,"I always thought Leonardo Di Caprio was just another pretty face.But I have rarely (if ever) seen better acting than the scene in this movie in which he comes back home to his mother and she refuses to take him in.DeCaprio mixes passion with a ""bad boy"" coolness in a way that I find very appealing.This movie is worth seeing for anyone who has dealt with loved ones who are addicted. Having been down that road myself, I didn't detect any false notes.For ""The Basketball Diaries"" alone, Di Caprio deserves to be a major star.Highest possible recommendation!",The Basketball Diaries
78,Michiel Waaijer,Very powerfull statement against drugs.,9,26 February 2000,"I think 'The basketball diaries' is a realistic and very important movie. It shows the road that one walks to being addicted to drugs. From taking dope once a week to taking dope every day, every hour. Leonardo DiCaprio playes a basketballplayer, a schoolkid(Jim Carrol) who walks this path. He experiments with drugs 'till there is no way back. He gets himself in all kinds of stupid situations. He starts robbing stores, ripping off money from old ladies just to get some cash for dope. His life is beginning to look like a living hell. His basketballcoach wants to have sex with him, and when he passes out on the basketballfield due to taking a wrong kind of 'pep-pil', he gets kicked out of the basketball team and from school. From this moment on everything goes in a downward spiral for DiCaprio.An excellent scenario you would say, and it is. The acting from DiCaprio is great. We saw it earlier on in his career when he got oscar-nominated for 'What's eating gilbert grape'. A gripping drama in which he playes a disabled kid. But in 'The basketball diaries' he playes an equally difficult part. Not a lot actors would have put down this kid who's life is wrecked, and who is constantly thinking about dope as well as DiCaprio did.The statement the movie delivers is a powerfull one. Being addicted to drugs is horrible. Usually people learn about this aspect trough seminars or televisonshows such as Oprah Winfrey. But it never really gets the kind of attention and understanding from the audience as 'The Basketball diaries' delivers.The amazing performance by DiCaprio, the fact that this movie is actually based on a true story and the reality the movie is set in, 'The basketball diaries' deserves a 9 out of 10.",The Basketball Diaries
79,witchcraftpentagrams,Why Isn't This In Top 250?!!!,10,4 January 2009,"I cried multiple times in this film. This is the best anti-drug film i have ever seen. Leonardo Dicaprio gives a great performance in this role as Jim Carroll and looks like he would when he was younger. I have never read any of the book or heard any of his music or read any of his poems but Jim Carroll seems like he had a tough life growing up with a heroin addiction. The drug sequences in this movie are very scary. He could have died at any time. I am wanting my mum to see this movie but she never has time for anything so hopefully soon i will be able to get her to view it. Also the display of the hooker and Jim and how the tables can turn can really turn you off drugs. Also the rape scene between Jims coach and himself is really frightening and disgusting because there are people like that in this world that do much more worse things than that. Anyway, go and see this movie. It is the greatest movie ever and i just don't know why this isn't in the top 250.",The Basketball Diaries
80,DigitalPhreaker,DeCaprio Was Brilliant,7,6 July 2004,"It pisses me off when people say that 'Basketball Diaries' is a rip-off of 'Requiem for a Dream.' The stupidity of the uneducated. It was interesting though seeing the similarities to both films, but that is besides the point.I was one of those people who thought that Leonardo DeCaprio was just a washed up 'Teen Beat' cover boy. All of that because of 'Titanic.' I really hate to admit that now that I have seen the majority of his work. The first time I really began changing my mind was in 2002 when he starred in both 'Gangs of New York' and 'Catch Me if You Can.' What got me thinking is that both Scorsese and Spielberg aren't the type of directors to hire an actor just because they have a teenage fanbase and also, DeCaprio's performances in both were excellent.But, it wasn't until recently that I changed my mind completely and realized just how much of an under-appreciated actor he is. He has done films like 'The Beach,' 'Basketball Diaries,' and more, all of which received high acclaim, but because of 'Titanic,' people won't give him a seconds glance. And he was great in 'Titanic.'Honestly, I doubt that there is any other actor out there who could've done a better job as Jim Carrol. Hell, even Mark Whalberg did a great job. He is another under-appreciated actor.If you are one of the many people who say that they won't see 'Basketball Diaries' because of Leo, don't be so judgmental. He made the movie so wonderful. It is an excellent film and he is an excellent actor.9/10",The Basketball Diaries

82,Mis_Behavin,Leonardo DiCaprio's best performance,8,19 September 2006,"This is an amazing film and in my opinion should be shown to every person of school age to show them the reality of taking hard drugs. In this true story, DiCaprio plays Jim Carroll, a teenager with a promising future as a Basketball Player in front of him. He and his friends take uppers etc for fun, but this soon develops into more serious drug addictions after he and 2 of his friends are thrown off the team when they are caught out one day.This film really shows the harsh side of drug-taking and that what may start out as a few pills and poppers, can lead to a more destructive path. Mark Wahlberg puts in an excellent performance as Jim's friend and I can honestly say I don't think there is a single cast member who lets this film down.An honest depiction of drug taking and it's not so glamorous side.",The Basketball Diaries
83,lbabe29,"A must see, if only for Dicaprio's powerful, intense and truly haunting performance",8,4 June 2010,"At just 19 years of age Leonardo Dicaprio gives undoubtedly one of the best performances i have ever seen, no matter how the overall film turned out (which was rather good) this film merits a watch just for this incredible piece of acting. ""The Basketball Diaries"" based on Jim Caroll's autobiographical novel tells the harrowing tale of a young teen Jim (Dicaprio) and his transition from star basketball player to desperate heroin addict. Here is a film so raw and wrenching that it makes for very hard viewing, showing with unflinching realism the effects such a drug will have and indeed the lengths it will push it's users. How Dicaprio was not awarded an Oscar for his performance here is truly a mystery. Very rarely does an actor so young give such a devastating portrayal. Dicaprio is so believable, his acting so natural it gets to a point where it's hard to believe he was not an actual heroin addict.In two particularly well acted scenes Dicaprio's desperation becomes almost too hard to bear. The first involves a ""withdrawal"" sequence in which he pleas for a hit, moaning (""It hurts, I just want a taste!'') over and over as he sobs and screams. Never have i seen an actor radiate so much intense desperation. The second involves another desperate but equally as brilliant acted scene. Here he is forced to beg his own mother for money. Moving from tearful, frantic pleas to fits of rage and finally endless deep sobbing, Dicaprio creates such a sense of agony its impossible not to be shocked at this incredible display of talent.The others actors do a credible job and help the film flow: the music is fitting, the script is good and at times even profound. My only issue with this film was that it felt a bit too preachy.....to in your face with its anti drug message, however staying that it sure achieves it, i doubt anyone would pick up heroin after watching this.An unsettling, disturbing ""junkie"" film with a mind-blowing performance from Dicaprio 8/10",The Basketball Diaries
84,sunbeamsfairy,Sobering view on drug use,10,20 May 2020,"So where can I start. I watched this film back in 1998. It has always stuck with me.
It is a very real , raw representation of how drug culture in the 90s early 2000s was normalized. I myself went there and it was an awful slippery slope.
Leo in this film was outstanding . I have no idea why he did not get an oscar for this. His supporting cast are also brilliant. The corruption from swifty, along with the father at the catholic school. It is what every young person needs to watch. It's a harsh reality. I'm watching it currently with my 17 year old.... one massive lesson from this is there is still a huge epidemic still and parents suffering all over world loosing kids to addiction and kids knowing no different... Its harrowing yet so truthful .",The Basketball Diaries
85,Johntrek187,Most Realistic film about Heroin abuse,10,11 January 2020,"As someone who's been in active addiction since being a teen till now, this film depicts the hopelessness, being broken down, the dope sickness, how you destroy yours and your family lives. Everything with stunning accuracy. My favorite of Dicaprio's work. This should be mandatory watching for teens to avoid opiates like the plague....",The Basketball Diaries
86,miketh,overwrought morality play,4,26 March 2001,"Heroin is bad. Quitting school is bad. Do heroin, and quit school, and you'll end up a hopeless loser. If you understand those two points, then you already know everything The Basketball Diaries is trying to tell you. If you think the drug issue is any more complex than that, then prepare to be disappointed by this movie.The movie started off somewhat promisingly, with a look at the lives of Jim Caroll and his friends (as interpreted by the moviemakers, of course). The first part is in turns funny and sad, and is generally realistic enough to be poignant.As soon as Leonardo diCaprio is forced to play someone spiralling into a nightmare of addiction, however, everything goes downhill. If this movie has any subtle or interesting point to make about drug abuse or society, it forgets it here. It just goes back and forth between silly drug-induced dreams and numerous scenes of petty crime, filthy rooms, and Jim looking increasingly corpselike.The main reason why this part of the movie seems so absurd is the performance of diCaprio himself. The scenes where he tries to get money from his mother, and where he goes through withdrawal, were so hammily overacted that I stopped being shocked and started laughing. Then I stopped laughing and started wanting to hit the mute button. There is one scene where he seems like he does nothing but moan ""maaaaaaaaaa... wahhhhh"" for minutes on end. There is a difference between drama and melodrama. It's clear that this movie can't resist portraying the latter at the expense of the former.Anyhow, if you want a movie that will challenge you to think about the drug issue, watch Traffic. If you want an after-school special, watch the Basketball Diaries.",The Basketball Diaries

90,Alea Intrica,Wields its message like a sledgehammer...,6,15 March 2003,"Perhaps it's not socially constructive to attempt subtlety in an anti-drug message, but artistically, this movie starts off well and then proceeds to tank.  It really lost me with the sort of symbolism I would expect to find in a 12-year old's writing assignment copied from yesterday's soap opera episode (to avoid a spoiler, I will only say - mother, window, can). Some performances were quite good (the mother for example), it looked nice, but all the early complexity of the movie is washed out by the end.

91,a_kamini,The Basketball Diaries,10,16 June 2015,"Is it limerick or should we say it's prose? The movie ""Basketball Diaries"" is a great one of childhood friends as depicted by Mark Wahlberg, Leonardo DiCaprio and others as they grow up hoping to achieve recognition on the courts as well as remain friends, grow into good lovers, and tackle society in their midst. There presence together and apart challenges themselves and each other to recognize their demons and remove them to be able to move on with each other in a sportsmanlike fashion. The story is fashioned to be a parody of puberty in a sense I think but for the boy, and not the girl. It is a funny story about how boys grow up, the mistakes the make or might make and the challenges that could possibly face growing up. It reaches for goals as they would and then get disappointed with them and embraces them as they do it, challenging them along the way giving nothing but heartfelt recognition to the plight of boyhood but in a tough kinda way.",The Basketball Diaries

I recently watched it again and really thought it was rather awful. I cringed during Leonardo's whining and over-acting. I was unmoved by its begging for seriousness when the acting was truly not very good. Not to mention, Wahlberg sort of mucked this one up for me as well. I have never been a great fan of his acting (I hope he does something surprising in The Departed).I have met and been around people addicted to heroin.

The movie is by all counts an accurate portrayal of his life right before getting his recording contract.  DiCaprio, sports a credible likeness to Jim Carroll and does a fine job here.  The movie is harsh and not for young or sensitive viewers.  My recommendation is get music by Jim Carroll and view the movie later if interested.",The Basketball Diaries

I remember at the time thinking how powerful a performance Leonardo Dicaprio gave of Jim Carrol's real life character. The performance was so good I remember at the time telling friends who had recently seen Titanic, that they will be shocked by this performance as it proved he is one of the most versatile actors in cinema today and then. Over the years I have told people I have met, you need to see this movie but not many have and it seems to have sneaked under the radar a little. Therefore when It was on television recently I made everyone watch this film. Everyone who did came back to me saying the same thing, 'wasn't leo good in it'!! The scenes involving Carrol begging his mother to let him into the apartment so he can ask for money to help feed his drug habit are shockingly powerful.Its an amazing portrayal of the dangers of drug addiction and how it can effect young people who dabble with the dangers so quickly, turning their lives on its head with out them realising how it even happened. some strong messages in this film that many teenagers need to watch.Having watched it again some years later, It has dated slightly in time but not only Leo is outstanding but Mark Whalberg shows that he too was showing potential back then 15 years ago or so. I have never been too sure of Whalberg in the past sometimes mixing natural acting ability in movies such as 'the fighter' or his interesting performance of the character police detective 'dignam' in the departed with shocking performances such as 'the happening or Planet of the Apes (where to be honest I don't blame him but the directors for poor casting). But Wharlberg in this movie shows genuine class, perhaps portraying a young man who had an adolecence pretty similar to his diaries character 'mickey'.on a whole the film is a class act and hidden gem.

Most people know The Basketball Diaries from that sequence alone.  Experience this film for your self, it's very well acted by all the characters, Jim's mother probably plays on the most convincing mothers in cinema, as she did in Riding In Cars With Boys.  There is an anti-drug commercial featuring the band Everclear on the DVD, but other than at this movie really isn't something that preaches ""Don't do drugs 'cuz drugs are bad!"" like an after school special but a film that shows what heroin can do to you.8/10",The Basketball Diaries

Leonardo DiCaprio's performance as Jim Carroll is spot on. It seems that he really has an addiction to cocaine and heroin. Yes, he was trained by a coach to study the physical and mental side effects of drugs, but other than that he was a- mazing. Mark Wahlberg was okay, too, I guess. But he was actually addicted to cocaine when he was a teen, so it was easier for him. You think Trainspotters is good? Check this out! It will definitely make you think twice about drug and alcohol abuse, trust me. If you struggled with drugs in previous years, you'll fully understand this plot.

109,Menthol_Rock_n_Roll,you shouldn't miss this,7,17 March 2007,"I first watched The Basketball Diaries at 13 years of age. I am Australian and it is rated R but I found it totally compelling.Leonardo DiCaprio stars as Jim, a young high school student who falls into the world of drugs. Jim Carroll's autobiography of the same name was the idea of this film.It follows him through the stages of drug use, the things drugs force him into and the heartbreaking downward fall of a talented poet and basketball player.As a young female watching this, I have to say many of the scenes disgusted me - the stripper scene, the pornography and masturbation innuendos. Just not something a thirteen year old girl really wants to know about boys! But this movie holds an important message; that drugs can ruin a young person's life.",The Basketball Diaries
110,tom1994,Redemption?,5,12 May 2006,"So I had heard good things about this movie. It certainly does a good job depicting how ugly life can be. It is very dark. Leonardo DiCaprio did a good job in this film, but does much better in other works (just about everything else he has ever been in). The scene where he asks his mother for money and cries outside of her door should have been more violent. Maybe his character didn't have any more strength to act more violently, but the movie had me suspend disbelief willingly up until that point. The movie doesn't glorify drugs or violence and I didn't find it at all unrealistic until that scene outside of his mother's door. I expected Jim to be considerably more violent and desperate, but instead he just kind of paws at the door and at his mother and then whimpers and cries on the steps outside her door (oh he half heartedly yells out a few times but where is that desperate strength, that animal rage that should have been there?). And then at the end - Jim is redeemed so quickly - how and why? What does he have to live for? Why does he cleanup in jail? What is his life about after the drugs? Telling and retelling his horrific ""drughead"" days? That's not redemption. I did not find this movie to be as good as I was lead to believe it was going to be.",The Basketball Diaries
111,bviktor98,"Drugs are bad, m'kay?",4,22 July 2015,"I'm a huge fan of DiCaprio, so I watched this movie with great expectations. It was slightly disappointing.This is a propaganda film, not from the better kind. As my summary said, it was more like Mr. Mackeys speech against drugs from South Park. The main character plays in a basketball team, wanting to be a professional, but as he starts to take drugs, he loses his career, his friends, even his family. That kinda sums it up.I'm a 16 year old teenager, and it's clear that this movie targets my age group by its message. The book was much better in my opinion, because that had an impact on me(I read it after the movie). It has a moralist, preachy message, which is very weak. It didn't make me feel disgusted by drugs. I think Requiem for a Dream is a much, much better film to show teenagers what the consequences of taking drugs are. However, it wasn't very bad. There was one scene, which captures the books atmosphere quite good. The acting was solid, especially DiCaprio, who's as good as always, and the soundtrack is also alright.",The Basketball Diaries

The basketball diaries is one movie that could really shake you up and the fact that it is based on a real person really makes you believe in it, the screenplay and tremendous acting helps too. The fact that I have seen this movie so late makes it much easier to absorb, but I know for fact that it is one of the best performances I have seen from either Leonardo DiCaprio or Mark Whalberg.The movie is a must watch and for a person who can relate to it, it has a totally new meaning. The movie also focuses on the how relationships, be it parental or friendship work in such situations. I can't say that it's really going to make a difference in my or anyone else's life but this movie is going to drag you back to itself time and again.",The Basketball Diaries

The movie is really inspiring given that is based on a real story. Is the kind of stories who need to be showed more often, about people who managed to get rid of this addiction and become examples for the others
Leonardo Dicaprio' performance was incredible given that he wes only 20 years when this movie was made.
I recomand this movie for people who need a little bit of reality in their lives because this movie show the real situation of this world hiden behind big buildings and celebrities in New York for example.

There are other films which could fit into this group; ""Midnight Express"" comes to mind. During the short time that I spent living in Toronto, I saw a shocking number of people whose lives were destroyed by drugs.

They are partially responsible for his dwelling into drugs: Physical violence due to misbehaviour in class, a coach who is a pedophile, the general unhappiness Jim feels, a certain degree of poverty, his nihilistic mindset, a lack of a father figure and even the general environment filled with colors of black and gray.It's worth mentioning he doesn't have a stable role model. It is quite obvious he sought after one, by asking the priest, the nearest role model, for advice or even help. He gets rejected so he returns to his usual habits.His chronic unhappiness only gets worse as he gets kicked out from school, his home, they take everything from this young unguided kid & he is treated with general disgust from his close ones. Imagine being dependent to a substance, and then losing everything but that substance. Would you not try to escape reality?At least Reggy attempted to help, but he had nor the time nor the knowledge to help him. Jim had no motivation to quit, because he was already at the bottom, so he just wanted to practically suicide.All of this put him into the brink of anguish, and he has my sympathy for that. A flawed system with no understanding of addicts, which throws unhappy/addicts in cells. But it is still his fault for not seeing the path he was going towards.7/10, it's okay.",The Basketball Diaries

""Another teenager basketball player movie?"" you may ask, and the answer is no.With the help of Leo's amazing acting the movie clearly pictures how irresponsibility, the desire to be like others and to be ""cool"" can get you in big trouble.Definitely not a movie you would watch for fun with your friends and family, but worth watching to realize how easy it is to make your dreams unreachable.A movie full of dark emotions, actions you would never think of in other situations, and it leaves this very light feeling of emptiness after you watch it.A very clear and realistic picture of the gradual fall into the abyss.

119,chris_wickens4,proof of Dicaprio's talents,7,15 December 2004,"I feel that The Basketball Diaries is great film in terms of performances, i felt in some areas Scott Kalverts direction wasn't necessarily helpful to the film as some of the pace is lost during certain scenes and that he could have gotten greater performances from his actors, Lorraine Bracco proved herself in Scorsese's Goodfellas and i thought her performance became weak and unbelievable in parts. I find sometimes that after Titanic a lot of people under-rate Dicaprio as an actor whereas i feel hiswork in films prior such as, ""This Boy's life"" ""Romeo & Juliette"" and of course ""The basketball diaries"" all confirm that he is an important contempory actor and I predict that in twenty years down the line he will be mentioned in the same breath as De Niro, Pacino and Brando and i am thoroughly looking forward to ""The Aviator."" Another surprise performance for me was Mark Wahlberg, for some time i have rated him as a good actor and here we see why, he is entirely believable in the film which is surprising because it is early in his acting career. all in all i enjoyed the film but felt that i relied too heavily upon its actors and for me the direction was neither innovative nor fluid enough. cheers!",The Basketball Diaries

Leonardo Dicaprio's acting in this is some of his best and he captures brilliantly the painful descent into drug addiction.There is lots of swearing and violence is also common place: two groups of boys get into a fight, the main character has a dream in which he strides into school with a shotgun and shoots his classmate and teacher, an old woman is mugged and then attacked by two main characters, a character is threatened violently by a bigger man, a man falls off a roof and onto a car below (he dies).Drug use is, obviously, also common: characters smoke cigarettes and weed, they snort cocaine, take a wide variety of pills and inject themselves with heroine (the actual injection isn't shown on screen but we see the tourniquet, the needle, the drug, and the scars on a characters arm).Sex is also present: there is a scene with a scantily clad stripper, two characters kiss passionately, there is a sex scene off screen and we see the two characters half-dressed in bed afterwards. Prostitution is another theme with many people often offering the main character money for sex, including a male teacher. There is only one scene where prostitution actually takes place however it is harrowing, nothing is explicit but we see money exchanging hands before the older gentlemen gets on his knees and the main character unzips his trousers.Ultimately this film is a warning and so nothing is held back (including a disturbing scene in which a character goes through excruciating withdrawal), its the kind of film that when its over it stays with you. It's become one of my firm favourites.",The Basketball Diaries

We follow Jim, and his friends, into a world where turning back is almost impossible alone.With thrilling performances, The Basketball Diaries should be watched by all, both under and over 18.

122,cb_roache,Most underrated film ever!,10,14 June 2007,"Trust me the basketball diaries is the one of the most underrated films I've ever seen, but on rare occasions that's what makes a film brilliant - this is one of those rare occasions.The acting is absolutely superb especially Dicaprio who people only seemed to acknowledge after playing a preety boy character 'Jack' in the Titanic. After watching this film I really appreciate what a marvelous actor he is. He's so convincing as Jim Carroll a basketball player, poet,drug addict and lost youth shedding his innocence in the seedy city of New York. Most powerful scene in the movie is when he is begging his 'Ma'for some money for a fix, which is absolutely heartbreaking to watch. Leo's acting really shines when he does a cold turkey scene which is one Oscar nomination well over due! It was so convincing, hairs on the back of your neck will stand up!Mark Wahlberg plays a disturbed tough guy/school pal very well, Lorraine Bracco is great as Jim's despairing mother and Jim Carroll himself (the author)makes a great cameo. If you haven't read the book the film will prompt you because it's a great read too. The commentary with extracts from Jim's poetry are very fitting and a very beautiful back-drop for Jim and his pals getting up to no good.One of my favourite films (could you tell?)

Even though I've never had any personal experience with drugs, I felt the film was an excellent representation of life as a drug addict. Every aspect of DiCaprio's performance was believable, from his withdrawal scene, to the scene at the end with his mother. I disagree with anyone who says this scene was melodramatic; I thought it was the complete opposite. DiCaprio did not hold back at all during this film; he was a big reason why I loved this movie so much. There was nothing about this film I didn't like; I was mesmerized. It has left me thinking and contemplating over it for several days now.",The Basketball Diaries
126,abard70,Irritating,1,23 January 2007,"This movie irritated me.I just wonder how Jim Carroll was involved in this easy, flat, boring, moralistic commonplace film (but seeing him with an old junkie haircut in a cameo makes me think he was involved). I also wonder how a bunch of quite good actors decided to work in this, with its cheap and ridiculous dialogues. And the version I saw, in Italian language, was even worse and cheaper. I guess all this reaction is partially due to the fact that I liked so much the Carroll's book when I was a teenager (and his first record too), and it was raw and sometimes poetic. It's not easy to make a good drug movie, we got plenty of examples, but this one is useless.

My first movie I seen with Leo was What's Eating Gilbert Grape? He was excellent in that movie, I couldn't believe he was able to act that good at such a young age. Everyone that was in the movie and played along side Leo did a great job, Mark, always love your work especially in your underwear.

131,GiantsRuleAll90,Cult movie?,10,3 December 2006,"I actually looked this film up on wikipedia.com, and discovered that they classify it as a CULT FILM, meaning it is only accepted by a select group of fans. Something is tremendously wrong with American cinema, to the point where I am disgusted.So thats how it works. A BRILLIANT film like Basketball Diaries is released and it gains little to no fame while pathetic productions like Lost in Translation receive Academy Award nominations. It is quite obvious Americans are too sensitive to accept topics like drug abuse, while the country is literally drowning in addiction.An average rating of 6.8? Please, lets be realistic. I gave it a straightforward ten, something I am reluctant to do often. Leonardo DiCaprio is phenomenal in every aspect of the movie, especially at the end when his mother rejects his desperate attempts for money. Call me crazy, and you will, he performs better than he did in Titanic. Meanwhile, the incorporation of Jim Carroll's poetry creates a certain attachment with the character in the movie. I rank this movie among my Top Three while my friends are unaware of its existence.So, all in all, I guess that is how it works in our great country. Americans rather see a movie that makes them smile or where the underdogs always win. No wonder our country is mocked so frequently.As a sixteen year old in the suburbs, I have been dramatically impacted by The Basketball Diaries, and intend to read the book.",The Basketball Diaries

It shows you what can and will really does happen when someone is on drugs, and just how fast you can get addicted.As an ex-heroin addict myself, I can relate to it so much. DiCaprio deserved an Oscar for his portrayal of Jim Carroll, he was just fabulous. The withdrawal scene really made you think it wasn't a movie, but a documentary, because of how real Leo made it seem. Also the scene where DiCaprio comes back to his mother dope sick & wanting some money, is very, very true. It's not over-exaggerated, not in the slightest bit. Heroin withdrawal is agony, and I was shocked how well Leo portrayed that agony. He makes it seem like he really was in that much pain.I think a lot of people under-estimate DiCaprio's acting abilities because of Titanic, but, after seeing him in this film as well as ""Gilbert Grape"", it will make you change your mind about him immediately, because he really is one our greatest actors.I once saw someone said that ""Diaries"" is a knock off of Requiem for A Dream. And that is absolutely not true. Diaries came out in 1995, Requiem came out much later.I recommend this movie to anyone. It is very honest & real. Absolutely stunning acting by everyone involved.

134,rory0,"A lurid, dark portrait of modern youth.",8,29 March 2007,"The Basketball Diaries is the true life story of Jim Carrol. Although please don't be fooled by the above as the film only charts a mere fraction of his adolescent youth, all of which is crammed into 97 minutes. But this is effective stuff. The acting is solid and at times superb(in particular is Bruno Kirby's perverse turn as Basketball coach 'Swifty')even good old Ernie (Ghostbusters) Hudson makes his presence known with very subtle delivery, especially as the film spirals deep into its very lucid heroine addiction centre. Stand out performances would have to go to Lorraine Bracco who plays Jim's tortured mother, Mark Wahlbergs 'fresh off the street rebel swagger' is fantastic to watch and we can't forget Leo's own characterisation of Jim Carrol. Clearly Leo is far more comfortable in these kind of roles. With stand out performances covered it must have made it easier for director Scott Kalvert to concentrate on the look of the film. Which is wonderfully dark, gritty and in places, quite beautiful. The directors only faults are his interpretation of the time period. The time of Jim Carrol's life that is being portrayed here is the 1970's, but when watching it you can't help but think it's more late 80's early 90's. Not too much wrong, though a bit longer would have been nice. This could even be considered a strong, honest 'don't do drugs lesson' for school children. and there's nothing wrong with that as this is a bold film with solid characterisation and fantastic imagery.

His portrayal of Jim was so real and raw that he gave so much of himself to the role that it began to look effortless. So many scenes in this movie were beautifully done.

If you want to enjoy The Basketball diaries you must go into it with an open mind and take the film for what it is. It isn't a fancy, modern, stylized, glamorized film about drugs but rather an honest, raw, bold and touching movie about the self-destruction of a boy who falls head first into the harrowing world of drug addiction.

At first I didn't understand this movie, but as I got older I understood it completely. It focuses on many issues that teens STILL face today. Only, this movie is different...this movie was an actual true story. It had absolutely great acting. The performances were unexpected....yet by the end I couldn't believe what I saw. Movies like this are out there that focus on the same concepts like (Thirteen), which was a movie I found to be completely un-realistic. But like I said this was different , this is something to actually see and to remember.The way Leonardo portrayed Jim Carroll was very interesting. I mean this was a man who actually went through the vixens of life. Drugs, Sex and the pressures of friends are just a few of them. He escaped the grasp and lives on to be a wonderfully insightfully poet. The many other REAL characters had great acting as well.

A few things I noticed: when this film opens they pan the NYC skyline showing the World Trade Center which wasn't completed until April of 1973. Jim Carroll's diaries where written during 1962-1966. There was also a Wendy's Hamburger's sign in one scene (founded in 1969), a sign for the show STOMP, which played in Union Square in the 1990's, the NY State license plates throughout the film had the Statue of Liberty on them and that style wasn't issued until the 90's. I believe the license plates in that time frame would have been gold with blue lettering. There was also part of a scene filmed in front of Hogs & Heifers in the meat packing district. I may be wrong on this one, but I don't think that bar was around in 1966. I couldn't find the facts to back me up on that last one, so it's just a hunch.",The Basketball Diaries
144,HiltonHeadHottie,The Basketball Diaries Plot Summery,10,31 August 2005,"Leonardo DiCaprio is one of the best actors of today. Personally I believe this is one of his best performances, he really brought the story to life with his unbelievable performance as Jim Carroll. The story begins with Jim Carroll (DiCaprio) as a teenage, probably 16 or 17, being woken up by a loud neighbor. Once he is up he begins writing in his journal. He and his friends goof-off, get high and disrupt other people's day. Through out the movie they all get heavier into their drugs. Jim is sexually harassed by his basketball coach, which some would say pushed him farther into his drug addiction. Mickey (Wahlberg) sees that Jim is blowing his writing and basketball career and pulls out from the crowd urging Jim to follow his lead. Jim and his other two friends, Pedro and Mickey, are all expelled from school and kicked out of their houses. You see them going to drastic measures to get the money for the addiction, such as robbing an elderly woman on the streets. In desperation they rob an ice cream bar. Pedro gets caught up in a milkshake, while Neutron finds a gun in the register. Suddenly they friends begin to hear sirens in the distance coming their way, when Pedro won't leave Neutron shoots him, so Jim and Neutron bolt. Jim confronts Neutron about killing their friend, however he shows no remorse. Later Neutron confides in Jim about the best dope he has ever had. However when they try the dope they find it isn't real. Neutron's anger overpowers him and he begins to chase the dealer. Jim quickly follows him, to find that Neutron kept the gun that he shot Pedro with. Jim isn't able to stop Neutron and he pushes the dealer off the roof. Jim is left alone and enters a depressed state. Jim ends up passed out in the snow only to be found by an African-American man, Reggie, that he used to play basketball with. Reggie (Ernie Hudson) takes him into his house and takes away his drugs. Reggie keeps Jim in his house hoping to kill his addiction. In the next scenes you see some disturbing images of a Jim rolling on the floor rolling around screaming and crying with blood shot eyes. When Jim finally escapes he wanders around for a while begging for money, running into a prostitute that he and his friends used to make fun of. He finally turns to his mother who, locks her son out of the house and begins crying and calls the police, knowing she really is trying to help him. The next scene answers all questions about his friends. You find out Mickey joined the NBA to pursue his basketball dreams, Neutron was tried as an adult for pushing the dealer off the roof and is in jail, Pedro had just gotten out of Juvenile Hall and offers Jim the finest dope ever. Jim declines, but offers Pedro to come check out what he is about to do. The final scene begins with the camera going around Jim, while he is talking about his experience with drugs. When the camera angle is showing the back of his head you see an audience that stands up applauding. This is one of the best movies I have ever seen. Even though it is a low budget movie the acting, directing, and story line makes up for it. I highly recommend this movie, however I suggest you take into consideration the rating because of the gravity of the subject and Leonardo DiCaprio's incredibly memorable performance as Jim Carroll",The Basketball Diaries
145,jaymehlman533,terrible film,2,30 September 2005,there was nothing worthwhile about sitting through this dreck. it's a terrible film. forget all the controversy that this film led to the shooting and killing of several high school students. it's just not a film worth watching. Should have had more basketball and stayed away from the ridiculous 'Hollywood' issues of drugs. the only ones who are obsessed with this are people in Hollywood. watch 'the fish that saved pittsburg' or 'white men can't jump' if you want to see a basketball film. do not waste your time on this utter garbage. do not waste a penny of your hard earned money renting it. spend it on good movies that entertain or at least have a good message.,The Basketball Diaries
146,valemaria,Struggling for a dream,10,12 April 2018,"The film brings us to the late 60s teenagers everyday life from a New York City in the USA. The main actor is Jim and his friends from catholic school are on the best basketball team in New York. Parallel with this Jimmy writes his thoughts into his small diary including his experiments with drugs, that lead him to addiction and erects huge problems with rehabilitation. He lost everything that he had before and nobody could help or give him an advice. 
The main idea is that even if you have a dream and all possibilities and qualities to receive it, you can lose everything with one decision, which will have consequences in another part of your life.
My favorite scene is where Jim went to his friend Bobby demonstrated to him that Bobby important to him. It was also very hard psychological moment, when he started to fight and wouldn't give up to make his life as it used to be. And I also like the scene, where he stays alone and starts to write poetry or only his thoughts in his diary, which hit to the depths of the soul and help audience Toto visit his skin and feel the same.",The Basketball Diaries
147,s-martijn,Powerful movie about the major drug problem in the world.,10,21 February 2006,"The movie starts with a very nice picture of how life is meant to be in the dream of America, although Jim has to miss his father, his mother is working hard to give him the life he needs to grow up as a wise man. During the movie we can see how Jim coverts from a boy who likes to write and play basketball to a drug addict who will do everything for a shot. His friends are dragging him into a life from were he will never be able to be a pro basketball player again. Ironic to see is how his friend introducing him to drugs becomes a pro basketball player after choosing for his career instead of drugs. Jim has to make some crucial decisions in a mather of life an death. He has to learn how to trust people again an start to work on his addiction.Its a very interesting movie with outstanding acting of DiCaprio. Offcourse i can't forget the complete cast of the movie for their outstanding performance.Thank you, Stefan Martijn Hengelo, The Netherlands",The Basketball Diaries

150,sasilicche,Never a dull moment in this one!,10,29 November 2018,"The story of a teenage basketball star whose life spirals out of control with drug addiction as he gets kicked off of the team and is disowned by his mother, before ultimately being found homeless and in the street after almost succumbing to his addiction. The team is touted as one of the best in the city. The boys are regular teenagers who are usually getting into petty trouble when they aren't playing basketball. Since this is a story about the struggles of coming of age, it becomes complex and dark before we get to the end and Jim is on the other side of his addiction. To start the movie the scene filmed from the rocks down by the river foreshadows the personalities the characters take on during the movie. Mickey seems wild and out of control. Pedro is an indecisive follower and Jimmy and Neutron are two of a kind basketball stars. This scene is followed by Jim and Neutron with their lady friends, but this is still before drugs begin to play a major factor in Jim's life, so it shows Jim still living the lifestyle of a star athlete, hence the girls and drugs are still coming easy. Bobby being terminally sick leaves a void in Jim that might go unnoticed, however it can be explained that if a high school teammate who is the leading scorer on the team gets sick and leaves school a major void will be felt by the entire community, so of course Bobby's teammate and best friend is troubled and depressed by this. After Bobby's funeral the pickup game that the boys play is the best basketball action we see in the movie and is shows the purity of the game. It looks fun again. It looks like an escape from their realities. This shows the game that these boys grew up playing, not the game that is being marketed in the newspapers and that has scholarship money on the line. Before the game is played the boys are reminiscing and Jim has very strong emotions coming out. It is almost irony that basketball is what Jim loses to drugs, yet in this scene it is what is helping him heal from his friends tragic death. After the dark addiction scenes and right before Mickey gets into trouble for good, we see Neutron on television being interviewed saying he is going to St. John's to further his career and play basketball after high school. This finalizes that Jim's career is over. There is no going back because that part of his life is over. In the earlier scene when Jim leaves home for good, his mother throws a basketball trophy from the upper story window down to the street and it also symbolizes the end of things for not only the mother/son relationship, but it also shows the end of Jim's mom supporting his basketball career. The dream has ended for both of them. The addiction scenes are followed by Jim showing up in a public speaking role about his addiction, which is a sign of him being a leader still despite not having a basketball career and this again shows him being more like Neutron than Pedro or Mickey, which also shows how we are supposed to see Jim's true character. The movie ends with an update and we learn before the credits that Jim is still alive and doing okay in New York.",The Basketball Diaries
