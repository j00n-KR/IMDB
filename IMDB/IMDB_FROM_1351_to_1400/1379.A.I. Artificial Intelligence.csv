0,TheLittleSongbird,Can I be honest? I think this is one of Spielburg's better movies,8,29 November 2009,"I was not kidding when I wrote that summary. Artificial Intelligence:AI is a very captivating and astonishing achievement from Steven Spielburg. And I do think it is one of his better movies along with Schindler's List, ET and Jaws. For one thing it is beautifully filmed; the cinematography was gorgeous and the special effects were absolutely jaw dropping. The direction is very refined, and while reminiscent of Pinocchio the story driving this film is resolutely dark, ambitious and even daring. The acting is extremely impressive. Haley Joel Osment proves that he is a fine child actor in a truly astonishing lead performance, and Jude Law in one of his better performance matches him perfectly as his protector. Many complained of the character of Monica, personally I had no problem with her and Frances O'Connor makes the most of what she is given. There is terrific support also from Brendan Gleeson and Robin Williams (as the voice of Dr Know). That teddy bear, voiced by Jack Angel, is really rather cute. Some of the film is intensely moving thanks to the remarkable and eerie score from John Williams, however there are some parts of the in-general well written screenplay that are close to over-sentimental. My only other complaint is that the ""feel-good"" ending felt rather tacked on. In conclusion, a rather bleak, ambitious but daring and compelling movie. 8.5/10 Bethany Cox",A.I.

1,Leofwine_draca,Spielberg's sci-fi art-house flick and maybe the lost Kubrick movie,8,25 February 2015,"Compelling, slow-paced, lengthy, intelligent, thoughtful, wise and occasionally profound. Steven Spielberg's sci-fi drama is definitely not your average ""crowd pleaser"" and lost its way when released as a general Hollywood blockbuster, turning off the crowds who perhaps expected action and thrills instead of the leisurely paced, almost ""art house"" type film that Spielberg finally delivered. I'm not sure what I expected of this movie, having little knowledge about it beforehand, but I was desperately hoping it wouldn't be a new-fangled E.T. again.At the end of the two hours and twenty minutes I came away with a lot of thoughts and a lot of questions, so Spielberg must have done something right. Of course, Kubrick's beyond-the-grave involvement hangs over the movie like a watchful shadow and some sequences in the film are pure Kubrick. Others are pure, emotional Spielberg (the sentimental ending, for instance) and the pairing of the two directors is one to be seen. It at least makes for a totally unique movie with big aspirations, and one which genuinely questions the nature of the robot/human relationship in a way few (if any) other science fiction films have done so.The film has tons of themes and layers to it. A full analysis would come to twenty pages or more. Some will be picked up by the individual viewer, others missed until a later screening. The central character of David is utterly complex and his character arc is interesting – a blend of the futuristic and the fairy-tale that is pulled off well. Worried about the casting of a child as the lead, I half-expected this to be a kid's film with kiddie trappings. In some instances, it does feel a little childish (the image of the blue fairy, although representing much much more than just a fairy tale character – more like a miracle or an impossibility) and has that undeveloped Spielbergian touch to it. Ironically, the biggest kiddie trapping – the animated Teddy that follows David through his various adventures – became the most enjoyable part of the film for me. This has got to be the most lovable non-living creation in a film since we saw Wilson in CASTAWAY.The film is more than watchable – despite lengthy scenes in which little happens – thanks to the technical proficiency and the casting. Technically, the film is superior. Spielberg pulls off some spectacular shots – an underwater Manhatten – and fills the movie with authentic robotic creations. The opening where the woman's face comes off is astounding and Stan Winston and his pals create some of the best-looking CGI that I've ever seen. Watch out for the arena-style thrills of the Flesh Fair, which is pretty disturbing and would garner an X-rating if the participants were human instead of mecha. The super-cool ""aliens"" which appear in the final act are also highly impressive creations.Cast-wise, the film is sound. Haley Joel Osment is incredible as the robot kid and I don't believe his performance could be bettered. He is thoroughly realistic as a robot struggling to be human. This is even better than his breakthrough performance in THE SIXTH SENSE. Frances O'Connor is also effective as the flawed mother, David's object of fixation, and her presence adds to the warmth of the film considerably. Other fixtures like Brendan Gleeson and William Hurt fill out smaller roles with adequacy, but its Jude Law who steals his scenes as the robotic Gigolo Joe. Law is fantastic and lives the character he plays. By the end of the film I had cried thanks to some spellbinding scenes of emotion and felt like I'd witnessed a great work. And that's everything I have to say on the matter.",A.I. Artificial Intelligence
2,SnoopyStyle,Not harsh or dark enough,6,26 January 2014,"In a future world, there are mechanical robots called mechas. After Monica (Frances O'Connor)'s son Martin is put in cryo-stasis, her husband brings home a super realistic child robot David (Haley Joel Osment) home. She hates it at first but she starts to get used to him until his son is suddenly revive. Martin dismisses David as a toy and plays cruel jokes on him. David is more and more relegated to second class until he is abandoned on the roadside. On the road, he finds fellow robots including Gigolo Joe (Jude Law). He goes on an odyssey to become a real boy inspired by the story of Pinocchio.I almost feel like this could be a great horror story idea. But Spielberg is doing his child like wonder thing. It loses much of its possible tension. It's as if Spielberg has deliberately soften all the rough edges to make a morality play. On the good side, Spielberg once again shows that he is a master craftsman. This movie is beautifully put together.",A.I. Artificial Intelligence
3,Hitchcoc,Intelligent,7,10 January 2017,"First of all, this was done very well in the most technological way. The CGI are outstanding. Hailey Jo Osmet is wonderful as the young robot, having grasped the movements and the actions of artificial intelligence. That's a first positive. But what is really the strength of this film has to do with a plot involving parents who have been devastated by the impermanent loss of their son who is being kept in a suspended state until he can be brought back. The result is a sentient robot that can take on the role of the son. The scientists have produced a ""child"" that is sentient and can experience emotions like love and loyalty. When the actual son is revived things start to snowball. This is a movie that had limited success. See it if you have a chance.",A.I. Artificial Intelligence
4,Prismark10,Mecha World,7,6 July 2016,"AI is inspired by British science fiction writer, Brian Aldiss short story 'Supertoys Last All Summer Long.' It was a project initiated by Stanley Kubrick and then taken over by Steven Spielberg who directs as well as write the screenplay. It is a mixture of Spielberg's wide eyed childlike wonder from his ET era with Kubrick's cold gaze of adulthood. It is a modern version of Pinocchio.The film is set in a future where the ice caps have melted and eradicated the coastline. Robots of increasing sophistication have become part of the fabric of society. Professor Hobby (William Hurt) has created an android with programme to love and be more human like.Monica and Henry Swinton (Frances O'Connor and Sam Robards) have a terminally ill son and take in David (Haley Joel Osment) almost as a substitute son to love. David as he is programmed is fixated on his mother and projects his love.When their son Martin (Jake Thomas) miraculously recovers and returns home, the new family of four becomes fractious. Martin is mean to David who cannot interact with other kids. It is not in his programming. An incident means that like a dangerous pet, he could be dangerous in the house. However Monica is not willing to send him back to the corporation where he would be presumably terminated.Monica cares enough for David to abandon him in the woods with a Teddy Bear who is also an AI robot for companionship and wisdom (his Jiminy Cricket.) From there David befriends other robots such as Gigolo Joe (Jude Law), a sex-bot on the run after being framed for murder. They evade resentful humans and journey to find the Blue Fairy whom David believes can turn him into a real boy so his mother can love him.David is a boy who becomes accepted quickly by becoming part of a family only to find that he is not afforded their protection when he is gauded and provoked by Martin. Once in he wilds with Gigolo Joe he is living in fear in a society where robots have no rights.Spielberg creates two sound stages for the middle of his film. Flesh Fair a gaudy, sleazy place where robots are destroyed in front of cheering humans but David pleads for his life and swings the crowd his way. Then there is Rouge City, A Vegas type place where the holographic Dr Know points them to the top of Rockefeller Center in the flood hit of Manhattan where he meets his creator, Professor Hobby.The final act set in the submerged Coney Island which is then frozen over in an oncoming ice age until David is rescued by advanced beings.I have to confess. I liked the ending. It bought an emotional crescendo to a flawed film. It moved me as it allows David to find he is the recipient of love and can finally grow and become human even if it is all a projection from the beings that rescued him. Without this ending, I would had found this to be a dull, uninvolving and grim experience. Humans treating robots like pets who are soon discarded once they are no longer fulfil a useful function.I understand that this ending was part of the Kubrick draft and not added by Spielberg. Kubrick finally showed his sentimental side.",A.I. Artificial Intelligence
5,classicsoncall,"""If you let me, I'll be so real for you.""",7,13 March 2020,"If you consider it a strictly sc-fi film , ""AI"" is fairly passable; it has great cinematography, stunning visuals and a compelling look at the potential future of robotics. Where it goes off the rails is when it comes time to wrap up David's (Haley Joel Osment) quest to find his mother and become a real boy. The business with the future robots, disguised to look like advanced Whitley Strieber aliens, did provide a reasonable way for David to accomplish his mission, but I had a hard time getting past the idea that his mecha body could stand the ravages of salt water exposure over a period of two thousand years. For me, that wasn't consistent with the damage done to his mechanical workings when he chowed down on all that spinach dining with his adoptive 'parents' and brother Martin (Jake Thomas). Same thing when he fell into the swimming pool with Martin, though on a smaller scale. You can't really have it both ways and I find some movies do that more than I would like and expect.The movie does make you think though about the future of robots and how realistically human they might become, the female mecha introduced by Professor Hobby (William Hurt) early in the story attested to that. That was a neat piece of filming. A future war between robots and humans was given some resonance in the 'Flesh Fair' sequences, and it brought me back to all those 'Magnus, Robot Fighter' comics I read as a kid. And I couldn't help making a comparison between Dr. Know (voiced by Robin Williams) and Professor Marvel in ""The Wizard of Oz"", you know, the man behind the curtain. What's even more obvious in terms of an homage is the Pinocchio/Blue Fairy portion of the story. All that gave the picture somewhat of a surreal quality that's a hallmark of cool sci-fi.Overall I thought it was a decent movie, but would have preferred more consistency in theme and presentation. The dynamic between David and his human mother Monica was excellently depicted, but it did offer a singular distraction. The actress Frances O'Connor who portrayed Monica Swinton looked so similar to a young Mary Tyler Moore that I couldn't think of anyone else in the scenes she appeared in.",A.I. Artificial Intelligence
6,lee_eisenberg,more Spielbergian than Kubrickian,5,27 December 2005,"""Artificial Intelligence: AI"" would have been better had they ended it a few minutes earlier. Focusing on robot David (Haley Joel Osment) seeking to become a real boy, it certainly looks at some interesting things - namely global warming and fear of the ""other"" - but about the last twenty minutes made it kind of lousy; that's where you can tell that it was no longer Stanley Kubrick's idea and Steven Spielberg took over.Still, you can see connections to other Kubrick movies, namely during the first few minutes of Gigolo Joe (Jude Law). While dancing Gene Kelly-style, he passes by the Korova bar - all alluding to ""A Clockwork Orange"". Also, there's the omniscient narrator (although it seems to be Gigolo Joe).A particularly interesting character is Robin Williams as holographic Dr. Know (there's nothing he doesn't). Other cast members include Frances O'Connor and Sam Robards as David's human parents, William Hurt as David's inventor, Brendan Gleeson as an anti-robot crusader, Chris Rock as another robot, and Meryl Streep as a fairy. Not a bad movie, but it should have been better given what went into it.",A.I. Artificial Intelligence
7,jboothmillard,A.I. Artificial Intelligence,5,1 August 2009,"This film was due to be made by Stanley Kubrick (2001: A Space Odyssey, A Clockwork Orange) just after he finished Eyes Wide Shut, he did start it, but Golden Globe nominated director Steven Spielberg (Jaws, Raiders of the Lost Ark, E. T. the Extra- Terrestrial, Schindler's List, Saving Private Ryan) took over direction when he died. Basically, Professor Hobby - The Visionary (William Hurt) has the idea to create a robot who can love, i.e. Creating a child robot that will love in the way a real child loves its parents. The couple that take the robot child, David (Haley Joel Osment), months later are Monica (Bedazzled's Frances O'Connor) and Henry Swinton (Sam Robards), as a replacement for their real son Martin (Jake Thomas), in a coma. Monica can't cope with trying to love a robot, and when Martin returns home all healthy she just can't take it anymore, and she sumps her in the woods. When David eventually finds civilisation, he finds a community of Mecha robots, and he forms a friendship Gigolo Joe (Golden Globe nominated Jude Law). Remembering the story of Pinocchio, David wants to find the Blue Fairy to make his dreams of being a real child come true. Somehow, this Blue Fairy does appear to be reality, but he cannot be transformed into a real boy to be loved by his ""mother"" Monica, she instead grants him the wish to have a day with her loving him like her own. Also starring Brendan Gleeson as Lord Johnson-Johnson, Ken Leung as Syatyoo-Sama, Sir Ben Kingsley as Specialist, Robin Williams as Dr. Know, Meryl Streep as Blue Mecha, Chris Rock as Comedian and Jack Angel as Teddy. It is very odd viewing this film, I felt uncomfortable during the mother trying to love a robot child, I got confused with the Blue Fairy thing - even with robots being reality in the story, and I felt a little sickly during the wish granted sequence. I will say it has got some alright performances, and an okay story I suppose, but it is the special effects that are the only good reason to see it, I think it is a little boring, but an average science-fiction drama. It was nominated the Oscars for Best Visual Effects, and Best Music, Original Score for John Williams, it was nominated the BAFTAs for Best Special Visual Effects, and it was nominated the Golden Globes for Best Original Score. Worth watching, at least once!",A.I. Artificial Intelligence
8,ccthemovieman-1,"Stunning Visuals, Involving Story But Typical Spielberg/Kubrick Bias",6,20 November 2006,"This has to be Steven Spielberg's strangest film. Maybe that's because he collaborated with Stanley Kubrick on it, and Kubrick's movies are almost all bizarre. It was another of those films I found fascinating on the first look but increasingly unlikeable on subsequent looks. It went from a ""9"" on the first viewing, to a ""7"" to a ""5."" In fact, I didn't even finish it on the third look.Nonetheless, it's the typical Spielberg or Kubrick film in a number of areas, meaning great visuals, just stunning at times; a definite anti-Christian bias (that you see more and more in the carnival segment as you watch this multiple times); a very secular humanist outlook on life but a nice sentimental ending with the message that everyone needs to feel loved.Haley Joel Osment gives one more example of why he is one of the best child actors of any era. His role is memorable and just the looks on his face would soften the hardest heart. The first of the three segments in this film was hard for me to watch in spots as the innocent Osment (""David"") was framed for things by his ""real brother"" and then abandoned by his mother. Those are difficult scenes because the film is involving right off the bat. You really care about this young boyThe rest of the film offers fantastic visuals and an interesting, but a too Liberal- slanted story, for me to watch again. Sorry, but Spielberg and Kubrick - two men who have made some extremely entertaining films - are too bigoted for my tastes, at least in this movie.",A.I. Artificial Intelligence
9,Tweekums,A modern Pinocchio,9,9 June 2016,"In the not too distant future global warming has caused the ice caps to melt flooding coastal cities and necessitating strict rules on the number of children people can have. Human looking robots have taken over many tasks and now a robotics engineer has come up with a new idea; to create a robotic child that will love the person it is imprinted on. The prototype, David, is given to a company employee whose wife Monica can't get over the fact that their child is in a coma. They are warned that once imprinting has taken place it can't be undone; if they decide they no longer want David he will have to be scrapped. All goes well until their son wakes from his coma; he sees David as a rival for his mother's love and it isn't long before an accident happens and they can no longer keep David. Unable to have him scrapped Monica leaves him in a remote location. David, remembering the story of Pinocchio that Monica read to him, he decides that he must find the Blue Fairy from that story so she can make him into a real boy and he can go home. He meets up with Gigolo Joe, a robot on the run, and together they try to find Blue Fairy although it won't be easy; on the way they will have to face people who revel in the destruction of robots and David will have to confront the fact that he is not unique.This is a fine film with a real emotional pull. Young Haley Joel Osment is great as David; he manages to make him not quite human without slipping into uncanny valley. Jude Law is equally good as Gigolo Joe; the robot who knows just how to please a woman. Both characters are sympathetic as are the other robots the scenes where some are destroyed at the 'Flesh Fair' is both tragic and rather shocking. The special effects are top notch and even now, fifteen years after the film's release, they don't look dated. Given that the story is clearly both inspired by 'Pinocchio' and also directly references it things could get too self-referential but thankfully it works very well. Some people won't like the ending but I found it both effective and emotional. Overall I'd certainly recommend this even though I know it won't be to everybody's taste.",A.I. Artificial Intelligence
10,moonspinner55,"Quite good...until they go ""off to see the Wizard""",5,29 September 2002,"In the 22nd century, with robots commonplace in society, a couple grieving their ill child receive a replacement: the first robotic boy! Director and co-screenwriter Steven Spielberg works peculiar magic with this story (initially conceptualized by his late friend Stanley Kubrick from the short story ""Supertoys Last All Summer Long"" by Brian Aldiss), setting up the pieces very carefully and then surging forth with dark adventure. The Flesh Fair sequence is masterful, as are some of the shots of Haley Joel Osment (doing fabulous work in the lead). But Spielberg stumbles early on with a birthday party scene which reveals the parents to be stupid and cruel (it's a cringe-worthy moment). Another dire sequence occurs later, when the kid and his traveling companion (a robot stud, who is wanted by the cops in a murky, unnecessary subplot) ask questions of an animated wizard with the voice of Robin Williams! Just when you feel Spielberg has grown up and taken stock of his strengthens, he throws in a corny curveball (perhaps to placate ""E.T."" fans?). The picture is ultimately unsuccessful in its storytelling--particularly with an epilogue that takes place 2000 years later!--however, much of the acting is fine and the art direction is incredible. Two Oscar nominations including Best Visual Effects, with no wins; the visual effects team were also nominated for a BAFTA. ** from ****",A.I. Artificial Intelligence
11,paul_haakonsen,Fantastic movie,8,26 November 2010,"""A.I."" is one of the better movies I have had the pleasure of seeing.The story told in the movie is very captivating, and it does raise some questions and issues. And it gives you something to think about, which I personally think is very good in a movie. It means that it has a deeper meaning than just shallow entertainment. The movie raises questions such as our own mortality, how do we deal with advanced robotic technology, and such. And of course, you have the aspect of intolerance to those different from ourselves (discrimination) - I am referring to the 'Flesh Fair' part of the movie.Haley Joel Osment puts on an amazing performance as David, and he does so with strong commitment and an amazing level of creditability. And you honestly do believe that he is an artificial creation. The performance of Jude Law as Joe was also amazing. He was so well cast for this role, and his appearance was so cool. He really had a very artificial look to him, and it was marvelous. Oh, and it is always nice to see William Hurt in a movie, despite his role was a mere supporting one.The scenery in the movie was great as well, having a believable future-like appearance to it, and it portrayed the difference between high-end living and the daily-run-of-the-mill lives by common people with less money. The rich environment was very sterile and neat, while the ordinary man was living in neon colored districts, and it was often grimy and rundown. That contrast between the two worked very well.Oh, and before I forget; TEDDY! That robotic teddy bear was so cool. Despite being only a minor side character, he was the one that stood out the most in my memory after the movie. He was simple awesome.Now, the only bad part of the movie was the last 30-45 minutes. The movie should have ended when David was trapped underwater, facing the Blue Fairy. I just didn't get the whole aspect of bringing aliens into the fray. At that point the movie became annoying to look at, and it took a turn for the worse, becoming a parody of itself. Had the movie ended when David was sitting trapped underwater staring at the Blue Fairy, the movie would have been 100% amazing. Why Spielberg chose to throw aliens into it is beyond me. But hey, that is what you get with artistic freedom, eh? I would have rated the movie higher, but this last part of the movie makes it a drag and thus pulls down the score. I usually end up stopping the movie at this point. I just can't take it serious.But all in all, ""A.I."" is an amazing movie that will stay with you for a long, long time once you have seen it. There is a lot of emotional scenes in the movie, lots of memorable scenes, and I think you will be returning to this movie again at a later time. It just have that 'repeated watch value' to it. If you haven't seen ""A.I."" yet, you definitely need to buy the movie and sit down and watch it. You will thank yourself for doing so. Trust me.",A.I. Artificial Intelligence
12,Quinoa1984,"Spielberg's (ah, er, Stanley Kubrick's) latest work of art",9,1 July 2001,"A.I. Artificial Intelligence is indeed a very memorable motion picture.  It is also, ambitious, visually exceptional, well acted, and also sometimes confusing and weird.  It is a plum with some flaws, to say the least.David (Haley Joel Osment) is the first child robot, created by a group of masterminds (headed by William Hurt) that want to have a robot who will feel affection for a human.  And indeed it seems as if the robot does have affection for his new ""parents"" played by Sam Robards and Frances O'Connor. But after he is abandoned, we follow him on his journey to become real.That's the little scoop on the movie that I knew before the movie began, but unlike many of the films that have come out recently, I had no clue what to expect from this film.  That was the first part of the appeal of this project that originated from the viruoso (albiet late) Stanley Kubrick and went along to Spielberg.  And I've got to hand it to the wonderkid of Hollywood that he has done a very splendid job with this movie.  The second half of it has some of the most creative and brilliant visual images I have ever seen in a contemporary film.  The  feeling is perfect and the acting is also very, very good with Osment being great as always, Law bringing fine vivacity to his Joe, Hurt's small yet significant role is heart-rending, and probably the most saddening of the performances by Frances O'Connor as the mother Monica.  All of this comes together to make a highly watchable, and often questioning movie that will make many people think after the movie.However, there are a couple of things keeping this from being one of Spielberg's best and tougher films.  For instance, you can tell near the end of the film that Spielberg was a little desperate (why else would he revert back to the same type of creatures he used in Close Encounters, his last writer/director project) plus, he tries once again to go for our hearts instead of our minds, and even though sometimes he is successful in other projects in making us cry and feel sadness for a character, it isn't needed here when David should be thought of but not cried over. 
But that is just personal squabbles; that shouldn't stop the average movie-goer to see this film in a season where films this visually breathtaking aren't good to come by (I mean that none of them that come out are as good as this).  One of the better films of the year and also contains the best visuals and special effects of the year.  Kudos also go to once again to Spielberg, Photographer Janusz Kaminski, editor Michael Kahn and visual effects supervisors Dennis Muren and Scott Farar. A",A.I. Artificial Intelligence
13,wes-connors,You Can Make It If You Cry,9,15 August 2008,"After his stunning 1990s success, Steven Spielberg satisfied those salivating to despise him, with ""A.I. Artificial Intelligence"". The poised knives could be released, at last! So, the initial reactions took an undeserved negative tone, while, still, offering praise to individual efforts too obviously evidenced in the production to ignore.This is really an excellent, thought-provoking film.The beginning of the film could have been improved by combining the character ""Professor Hobby"" into ""Henry Swinton"". The resulting ""Henry Swinton"" would, then, more closely resemble ""Geppetto"" from ""Pinocchio"". This would, necessarily, make ""David"" the image of their dead son. Then, the parents' conflict would be the focus of the film's first act. This would have made the relationship between the parents much more dynamic; and, it would throw the mother ""Monica"" (Frances O'Connor) into incalculable conflict with the robotic ""David"", resolved in the film's already powerful ending.Mr. Spielberg marvelously breathes life into Stanley Kubrick's unrealized project (he died before realizing this dream work); and, he directs Haley Joel Osment (as David) to a peak performance level. Mr. Osment, Jude Law (as Gigolo Joe), and ""Teddy"" (voiced by Jack Angel) are an unforgettable ""mecha"" (short for ""mechanical"") trio of humane robots.

14,sunwarrior13,An Emotionally Accessible Film,9,18 September 2012,"A.I. Artificial Intelligence, also known as A.I., is a science fiction drama film written and directed by Steven Spielberg.It was based on Brian Aldiss's short story ""Super-Toys Last All Summer Long"". It stars Haley Joel Osment, Jude Law, Frances O'Connor, Brendan Gleeson, and William Hurt. Set sometime in the future, A.I. tells the story of David, a childlike android uniquely programmed with the ability to love.David is a robot of the future, when the polar ice caps have melted and submerged many coastal cities, causing worldwide starvation and human dependence upon robotic assistance. The first robot designed to experience love, David is the ""son"" of Henry, an employee of the company that built the boy, and the grief-stricken Monica. David is meant to replace the couple's hopelessly comatose son, but when their natural child recovers, David is abandoned and sets out to become ""a real boy"" worthy of his mother's affection. Along the way, David is mentored by a pleasure-providing robot named Gigolo Joe and a talking ""super toy"" bear named Teddy. His adventures take him to the Roman Circus-style ""Flesh Fair,"" where robots are destroyed for the amusement of humans; Rouge City, where Gigolo Joe narrowly avoids capture by police; and finally a submerged New York City, where David's creator, Professor Hobby reveals the secrets of the boy's creation.The movie is surely flawed, to be sure, but beautifully crafted, unimaginably complex, visually dazzling, rich with metaphor and deeply affecting.The film tried to achieve too much by mixing a confined domestic drama, a considerable morality tale, a fleeting futuristic noir, a persecution parable and an on-the-nose fairy tale adventure. But nevertheless,it is a technically dazzling yet emotionally accessible to the inner child in everyone from 9 to 90.",A.I. Artificial Intelligence
15,hitchcockthelegend,"Heart, Brains and Wires.",10,13 July 2008,"David is a robot boy programmed to experience human emotions, after a series of unfortunate home life events he embarks on the ultimate voyage of discovery.Spielberg and Kubrick! Hmm ,well on first glance they appear to be odd bedfellows, but strip away the formers' high concept blockbusters and you can see traits that bring the two giants together. Debate will rage forever about if Spielberg's finished product is in line with what Kubrick had envisaged before sadly passing away to witness what he had asked Spielberg to mould. You can find hundreds of comments and philosophical arguments about the merits of Artificial Intelligence: AI, this site alone has been party to aggressive discussion about its intelligent worth, with the ending alone particularly causing consternation to many. So with that in mind I don't wish to over do my brainiac leanings on this bleak and cold masterpiece, I just wish to jot down my emotional thoughts about how this film makes me feel.I love this film so much, I really do, which considering it leaves me feeling quite desolate, makes it even more of a interesting statement. What Spielberg has done here is take Kubrick's cold eloquent style and fused it with a sort of edgy Pinocchio meets 2001's meaning, this is in short the polar opposite to his own E.T fable. Considering that this story is played out thru a robot child's point of view, the subject matter is shatteringly adult, it resonates with grim violence as it poses many unanswerable questions. What does it mean to be real? Can we replicate ourselves into a synthetic being? And just how close can that being be to being perfect? Love and it's power, where is the cut off point where we can say they are only human traits? You could go quite mad thinking too hard about it, and this is one of Spielbeg's masterstrokes with the picture, he is not here to spoon feed us {those thinking the ending is syrup are seriously misunderstanding it}, he outlays his grim tale and asks us if we dare to ponder these prevalent questions.Hayley Joel Osment is David and it's a hauntingly brilliant show from the youngster, intensely creepy and borderline freaky. David demands empathy as his loving family union comes crashing down around his newly emotive life, and it's here when the film takes a tonal shift that Osment excels. This then brings the excellent Jude Law, as mecha sex robot Gigolo Joe, into David's world, and here the film on the surface goes jaunty, but it's merely a brief diversion from the film's core bleakness and is in fact adding to the head scratching nature of the beast. The visuals are wonderful, from the colour explosion that is Rouge City, to the underwater sequences in the final third, Spielberg not only dazzles with his tools, but also shows that he can fuse CGI with a serious storyline and let them benefit each other. Must give a nod of approval to John Williams' score, nominated for an Oscar but not winning, it is however memorable and intensely touching.Artificial Intelligence is not for everyone, I can see quite easily why it is so hotly debated time and time again, but the work on the film is brilliant, almost as brilliant as the dark grim nature of the picture's heart. I firmly believe that in time this film will be revered as a classic, while I'm also convinced that they will dissect it in film studies classes long after I have left this mortal coil. I just know that it's poetically beautiful and that come the end credits I have a multitude of questions in my head and a multitude of tears in my eyes, it's an incredible movie experience. 10/10",A.I.

A couple get a robot boy David (Haley Joel Osment--very good) to replace their ""dead"" son. They grow to love him and vice versa. Then (with no explanation) their ""dead"" son is alive and living. They get rid of David and he's on a quest (with a walking, talking teddy bear) to find out how to be a real boy. He's helped by a way over the top Jude Law playing Gigolo Joe. The film is too long (2 1/2 hours), boring and confusing mishmash of previous Kubrick and Spielberg movies--that's a real problem, it prevents this film from having an identity of its own. There's the robot boy (Kubrick), the loving family (Spielberg), the walking talking teddy bear (VERY Spielberg), a city called Rouge full of sex and womens bodies (think a PG-13 version of ""Clockwork Orange""), a very eerie NYC under water (Kubrick) and a snoozy half-hour ending with aliens (direct descendents from Spielberg's ""Close Encounters"") and endless, deadening moralizing about him being a little boy (Kubrick again). The movie could have lost 20-30 minutes easy--way too slow. The tone of the film is very cold and clinical like ""2001: A Space Odessey"" (Kubrick). I didn't give a damn about any of these people or their problems. A few things kept me in my seat: the incredible special effects; Osment's quiet restrained performance (this kid is a wonder); Law going over the top constantly (and enjoying it) as Gigolo Joe and (I hate to admit this) the walking talking teddy bear. Just completely adorable!Still, I can not recommend it. Too slow, too cold and a boring, absolutely stupid ending. And what was William Hurt doing here? A big disappointment. Not a horrible film, but considering the talent involved a real disappointment. Avoid.",A.I. Artificial Intelligence
17,LeonLouisRicci,Spielberg's Most Underrated and Under Appreciated,10,1 June 2015,"This Movie is as Underrated as E.T. (1982) is Overrated.Steven Spielberg and Stanley Kubrick, Two of the most Admired Directors, combined Visions and worked Together until Kubrick's Death. Spielberg Took Over the Project but did Not Cheat on Kubrick's more Cynical and Pessimistic Approach.The Result is this Great Film that is an Emotionally Exhausting, Visually Exciting Fairy-Tale. It is Disturbing and Delightful. Basically it is ""Pinocchio"", Restyled and Revisioned in a Sci-Fi-Horror-Cautionary-Allegory for Modern Times.Not for Everyone, it may be too Unsettling at times for very Young Viewers. It is Heartwarming and Heart-Wrenching and Deeply Depressing. The Futuristic Visual Template is Amazing.Only the most Hardened of Hearts could be Unmoved by its Sentimentality seen through the Eyes of a Robot Child. The Parallels and Direct Links to Real Children are Painful to Watch as the Artificial Boy must go through Parental Rejection and some of Real-Life's Horrifying Realities.A Good Cast all Deliver Searing Performances in Difficult Roles. Overall the Movie is Not a very Pleasing Entertainment for those Wishing for the Usual Spielberg Scrubbed Suburbanism. Although the Movie does have an Abundance of Heart. The Viewer will find His/Her Heart Warmed and then Frozen, Filled with Love then Broken and Drained, only to have it Filled Again.For some it may be just Too Much of an Emotional Roller-Coaster Ride, but for others Willing to be Shaken and Stirred, Caressed and Cuddled, Shocked and Stunned, all at the Same Time, this is Just the Thing.An Under Appreciated Masterpiece of Manipulation, with No Pull Back along the Road Trip Search for Enlightenment.

18,grantss,Boring,3,15 August 2014,"I know I am supposed to like this movie - it is directed by Steven Spielberg, based on concept of Stanley Kubrick's, and has all these themes of what makes us human (a la Bladerunner), but I simply found this boring. The plot was unfocused and too schmaltzy. Worse than that, it goes for 2 1/2 hours!Special effects and cinematography are brilliant, as you would expect from Steven Spielberg, but that is it. Acting is overly syrupy. After admiring Haley Joel Osment's work in the The Sixth Sense (one of my favourite movies), he simply irritated me here.Not worth the time.",A.I. Artificial Intelligence
19,view_and_review,Artsy and Bizarre,5,13 September 2015,"I recently watched a couple of really good A.I. movies and wanted to add to that list by watching ""A.I."" I'd seen part of it a decade ago and wanted to watch it again to compare. Steven Spielberg screenplay, Spielberg directed, Spielberg produced... Should be great right? As we used to say as mischievous kids, ""psyche!""Sometime in the near future many of Earth's largest cities are under water due to the effects of climate change. Hundreds of millions in poorer nations die of starvation. With only wealthier people remaining and birth control laws in effect, robots become the go to resource for labor. Although the robots are intelligent and humanistic they don't have the breadth of emotions to make them truly like humans. That is until the creation of David (Haley Joel Osment).With a run time of nearly two and a half hours I felt nearly every minute of it drag by. David was the central character and his plight the central theme, but the drama of this lifelike boy was too rehearsed and pretentious. It was as though Ang Lee directed it. I could sense that Spielberg was trying make the viewers empathize with David much like viewers may have empathized with the robots of Blade Runner--and even more so here because the robot in play is merely a boy. For the most part Spielberg was successful but maybe not for the reasons he wanted. In other words, any emotions or compassion or empathy for David may have simply been because the movie was about him, much like ""Red Balloon"" or a movie about any other inanimate thing that's given human characteristics. Do you feel that strongly about robots, their survival and their ""dreams"" or have you grown a relationship with the one on screen because you're given its story?From the inflated budget of this financial flop was John Williams. Although Williams is a masterful and accomplished composer, his omnipresent musical score really grated on me. It was seemingly unending and belied what was going on on-screen. Many of the moments weren't portentous enough to warrant the somber mood given by the music.I don't want to be overly critical because the CGI was good as well as Osment's acting. As I mentioned before, it was impossible not to identify with the boy bot. And the story itself was a very credible one that could have worked if done better. But ultimately the artsy bizarre course of the movie made it distasteful.",A.I. Artificial Intelligence
20,neil-476,What a pity about the end,7,12 April 2009,"AI is a film with much to appreciate. The story is good, the performances are excellent (with Osment being startlingly good), and Spielberg, who rarely disappoints on the visual side of his movies, does not do so here - it looks fabulous and the effects are flawless. And, in David's abandonment, it contains one of the most emotionally horrifying scenes I have ever seen in a movie.If AI had run 10 minutes shorter then I would have loved it unreservedly. Had David been left, trapped underwater, looking up at the Blue Fairy and asking her to grant his request to turn him into a real boy, Pinocchio-style, then that ending would have been satisfying and right - uncomfortable, horrifying even, but right.But instead there is this coda tacked on whereby David is thawed out from frozen underwater New York by benevolent aliens and given a happy ending. It is corny, it never convinces and, to be frank, it goes some way towards dissipating the goodwill built up by the rest of the film.Cut it off, throw it away, and slap ""The End"" on the fade before the coda, Mr S, and then you will have something bordering on a masterpiece instead of something which leaves you with the sugary taste of schmaltz in your mouth.",A.I.

21,evanston_dad,A Spielberg Movie That Earns Its Tears,9,27 July 2010,"Steven Spielberg does sci-fi in the style of Stanley Kubrick, and the result is an intensely original and fascinating movie that seamlessly blends the best attributes of both.Spielberg's penchant for maudlin sentimentality is kept in check by Kubrick's clinical distance, while Kubrick's lack of humanity is tempered by Spielberg's warmth. The final product, about a little boy (albeit a robotic one) searching for a parent figure in a world full of things and people who want to hurt him, is mesmerizing. The final 20 minutes or so made my heart literally ache, but in a way that for once didn't make me feel cheaply manipulated.Haley Joel Osment gives an astonishing performance as the little boy, and Jude Law, as a robot gigolo, and Frances O'Connor, as Osment's human ""mother,"" do terrific work in supporting roles.Grade: A",A.I.

22,anaconda-40658,Totally Artificial.,5,13 July 2015,"A.I.: Artificial Intelligence (2001): Dir: Steven Spielberg / Cast: Haley Joel Osment, Jude Law, Sam Robards, Frances O'Connor, William Hurt: Best scene regards a robot witnessing the destruction of his kind for the love of violence. Unlike ""E.T."" it is not given why ""A.I."" is initialed. Haley Joel Osment stars as a robot adopted into a family when their own son is frozen with a terminal illness. Through a series of events Osment is abandoned and eventually companioned with another robot named Gigolo Joe. Joe is framed for murder but he will assist Osment in his search for the Blue Fairy. He is familiar with Pinocchio, which is where his ambition initiates. Steven Spielberg creates a fantastic futuristic world but it lacks the warmth of E.T.: The Extra-Terrestrial. Osment is strong as the lead pulling off a sympathetic performance but the ending is depressing. Jude Law as Gigolo Joe steals scenes but the role is totally unnecessary and could have been demolished long before his arrest. Frances O'Connor is strong as Osment's mother who cannot emotionally accept the artificial replacement. Sam Robards as his father sees him as a mend for loss. William Hurt plays Osment's creator and he is exactly what was needed for a screenwriter because that element is sadly lacking here. Outstanding visual wonder about being human but the ending is lackluster and totally artificial. Score: 5 ½ / 10",A.I. Artificial Intelligence
23,HotToastyRag,Stay away from this tearjerker,1,8 December 2017,"I don't know who came up with the idea to make this movie—okay, I do: Steven Spielberg and Stanley Kubrick—but if I could choose one movie that should never have been made, it just might be A.I. Artificial Intelligence. It is one of the saddest films I've ever seen, and when my family went enthusiastically to see it in the theaters upon its release, we all ended up in a gigantic puddle of tears. Please, even if you live off of science fiction films, stay away from this one.Haley Joel Osment, one of the most talented child actors in existence, stars as a robotic child. Set in a futuristic world in which several major cities have been swallowed up by the aftermaths of global warming, robots are now readily available and blend in pretty well with the rest of society. Frances O'Connor and Sam Robards adopt Haley because their human son is on the brink of death. While he falls in love with his family, they don't feel the same way, especially when their real son recovers from his illness and rejoins the family. As a robot, Haley feels real emotions, but sometimes doesn't understand the reason behind them. In one scene, he overhears Sam telling Frances she smells good, so Haley drenches himself in an entire bottle of her perfume in order to gain Sam's love. In another, he's sitting at the table during dinner—which he can't partake of because he's a robot—and he tries to eat so he doesn't feel so isolated from the family. Those are only two of countless heartbreaking scenes in the film.I can't imagine any mother making it through this movie in one piece, and if you were thinking of letting your children watch it, think again. Frances ends up dropping Haley off in the middle of the woods and abandoning him with nothing but his mechanical teddy bear for comfort. Even now, sixteen years later, that scene is vivid in my mind, and I wish as fervently as I did then that I'd never seen this movie.There is only one good element in the movie: Jude Law. He plays a male prostitute robot, and his performance is excellent. Haley Joel Osment is wonderful as well, and it's mind-boggling to see such talent at a young age, but it's also frustrating to watch—his parents allowed him to act in such an upsetting film, and that takes some of the joy out of watching his talent. But back to Jude Law: if you've never seen him before, you might think that he wasn't a real actor. He's so convincing in his movements, expressions, and delivery that it seems like he's a computer-generated character. If the movie wasn't so horrendously disturbing, it might be worth watching for his performance.Kiddy warning: Obviously, you have control over your own children. However, due to extremely upsetting scenes involving children, I wouldn't let my kids watch it.",A.I. Artificial Intelligence
24,zetes,Worst ending to a great movie ever; SPOILERS,9,1 July 2001,"For a majority of its running time, A.I. promises to be the best movie this year, and possibly one of the best films ever. There is hardly a wrong step in the script, acting, direction, scoring, set design, special effects, or cinematography for the longest time.Then, the film comes to a dead end: David, the robot child (mecha) played by Haley Joel Osment, is trapped underwater at the end of a long journey. His programming becomes caught on an endless loop, and the camera begins to zoom out. It would have worked as the end of the film. A depressing end, but one which the film lead to the entire time. Instead, Spielberg delivers the most outrageous deus ex machina I've ever seen in a film, or even a Greek tragedy. A narrator, a tool which is very out of date, begins to speak: ""David stayed that way for two thousand years."" In those two thousand years, another ice age arises, and with it the extinction of mankind. We see the frozen landscape that used to be NY City underwater, and through it flies an alien spacecraft. The aliens have uncovered David, and they revive him in order to learn all they can about the extinct human race. They bring David to a research center, designed after his former home, a la 2001: A Space Odyssey. The aliens, who have apparently learned English from studying Osment's program, choose to revive his mother, because that is what he wants more than anything.What results is meant to be touching, but it is the least truthful and most cloying ending you could ever imagine. This is a worse cheat than the bookends of Saving Private Ryan or the modern day grave sequence in Schindler's List, a scene that more or less diminished that otherwise great film significantly. The mood of the rest of the movie was one of mourning and cynicism. Human beings are shown to be liars and users, uncaring murderers. David's original owners abandon him because of their impatience, and treat him as if he is a toy, not a human being. And the most ironic thing about that ending is that, although all the cues tell us that we're supposed to be sentimental about this whole meeting, we know as an audience (or at least I knew; many people were, in fact, crying) that this mother is entirely fabricated. After she dies, which will happen when she falls asleep after the first night, David will be the subject of study for the aliens, as much as Dave Bowman of 2001 was in that film. If Spielberg would have held that irony at the surface, instead of burying it under craploads of false sentimentality, it had potential to be profound. I still could have done without the ridiculous looking aliens, but I also could have accepted it. The film ends on such a blatantly false moment that most of the audience, any who are intelligent enough to be able to identify and follow the themes of the rest of the film, will stumble out dumbfounded at the way Spielberg shoots himself in the foot. Others will coo like the dumb pigeons that they are.",A.I. Artificial Intelligence
25,namashi_1,A Remarkable Film!,10,30 September 2011,"'A.I. Artificial Intelligence' is A Remarkable Film in all respects. A moving, spell-bindingly emotional film, that is worth a viewing, for it's brave story.'A.I. Artificial Intelligence' Synopsis: A highly advanced robotic boy longs to become ""real"" so that he can regain the love of his human mother.Development of A.I. originally began with director Stanley Kubrick in the early 1970s, but due to his belief that no child actor would believably portray it's protagonist David, he never made it, but in 1995, Kubrick handed A.I. to Steven Spielberg, but the film did not gain momentum until Kubrick's death in 1999. This film was dedicated to the memory of the Cinema Legend, whose films have left us stunned.'A.I. Artificial Intelligence' is one of the finest films of all-time, because of it's brave story, that is full of emotions. A story about a robot who can fall in love, firstly, is a remarkable thought & the execution to the thought, is so well-done, that It actually left me in tears. The Power of this film is not it's astonishing visuals, but it's story, that holds you & moves you.Spielberg & Ian Watson's Screenplay deserves an ovation. Spielberg's direction is wonderful. He has handled this story with great understanding & patience. Cinematography is picture-perfect. Editing is good. Special-Effects are absolutely stunning, while the Music by John Williams is in sync with the film's mood. Performance-Wise: Haley Joel Osment as David, is heart-breaking. The Oscar-Nominated Actor delivers one of the most challenging & moving performances of all-times. A performance, that is above any compliment. As his mother, Frances O'Connor is first-rate. Jude Law supports well. William Hurt, in a brief role, is superb. Jake Thomas is passable. Brendan Gleeson is fair. Others lend support. On the whole, 'A.I. Artificial Intelligence' is amongst the finest films of it's time. A film that is sure to remain in the hearts of cinema lovers. Two Thumbs Up!",A.I. Artificial Intelligence
26,=G=,Cool floparoo!,7,6 March 2002,"""A.I. Artificial Intelligence"" is a bloated, over-wrought kaleidoscope of visual effects and a tedious tale of a young robot boy's odyssey to find a blue fairy to make him real, as in Pinocchio. Spielberg applies the more-is-more philosophy of film making to create this visually stunning but off target wandering which pumps effects into the gaping holes where a story should be. An interesting watch for technical and production excellence, ""A.I."" eventually becomes a boring morass of excess. Rent the video but be prepared to keep the thumb on the fast-forward button.",A.I.

27,MovieAddict2016,Stinker Alert!,3,27 January 2003,"I remember that there was much hype built up about this film upon its release. When it came out on video I was quite eager to see it. How unfortunate that it turned out to be a boring, weird, pointless film. David (Haley Joel ""Sixth Sense"" Osment) is eleven years old. Well, not really. He's a robot. A robot that wants to learn to love, or something all too familiar like that (see another sappy movie, named ""Bicentennial Man (1999)"") Anyway, he goes on this magical journey with another robot, Deuce Bigalow Male Gigalo -- er, Joe Gigalo. Sorry. Continuing with our boring plot summary, David, being the dumb robot he is, wants to find the blue fairy from Pinochio to make a wish to be human. I've heard theories about the end ***SPOILERS*** that the aliens are not really aliens, that they are really robots that took over the world. Well, if they're smart enough to take over the human race, why is one dumb enough to search for a blue fairy that any human knows is fake?
 Overall, I found the first half hour to be quite entertaining. But once the film reaches the point where ***SPOILERS*** David's ""mother"" drops him off in the woods, the film goes downhill and never gets back up. I couldn't wait for the movie to end. Steven Spielberg, unfortunately, didn't seem to KNOW when to end the film. The last half hour was one of the most boring film climaxes I have ever witnessed.Too bad, I usually like Steven's work. This and ""Minority Report"" had to be the most overrated movies of 2001 and 2002 respectively.1.5/5 stars --John Ulmer",A.I. Artificial Intelligence

30,KineticSeoul,"Brave Kubrick, Spielberg and Osment",8,13 May 2014,"This is a sci-fi philosophical movie that keeps things simple. When I first saw this movie I thought it was amazing. Back than the CGI, visuals and special effects was top notch when it came to this movie. Seeing it now I can see some areas that are lacking, when it comes to the development. But it still holds up today as a really good movie. I actually got a chance to see this again because one of my friend wanted to see it during Mother's Day and it actually made me tear up a bit. Than I knew this movie was doing something right. Steven Spielberg's child-like heart and imagination really comes to life in this movie. It just has so much heart and emotion. And Haley Joel Osment was such a great child actor back than, he actually is one of the drive of this film. It's a shame he didn't grow up to be tall and handsome. This film seemed to combine elements from Kubrick and Hitchcock with Spielberg's imagination. This is a sci-fi film with heart and imagination with a bit of philosophical view points thrown in. Although I disliked the ending, I still give this movie a 8/10.8/10",A.I. Artificial Intelligence
31,cherold,Spielbrick,8,1 July 2001,"I would say that A.I. is not the film Kubrick would have made and it's not typical of Spielberg.  It's interesting to see the mix.  At times you can say, that's Kubrick, as in the mother reading to her comatose son while classical music plays or David at the dinner table framed by a halo-like light, but at the same time the movie plays on your emotions in a way Kubrick films never do.  At times the film has a cold, clinical Kubrick feel, and other times it's got a bit of that Spielberg emotion, but it's really its own thing.  While it fails to be a brilliant film, and isn't in the same league with Clockwork Orange or E.T., it is a very good film. Personally I even liked the much-derided ending, although it could have been tightened a bit.  My wife found the ending laughable and along with a few other people in the audience actually laughed out loud at the end, which really annoyed me.  I got mad when she said the film sucked.  Perhaps that's what is most Kubrick about the film; it elicits strong opinions one way or another.",A.I. Artificial Intelligence
32,dromasca,A Disappointment (on Spielberg scale),7,6 October 2001,"This is really one of Spielberg's less appealing movies in a while. The idea is nice, and the story is well driven for most of the time - but then it becomes too long. Actually it looks like this movie had like three different ends, and Spielberg could not make his mind about which one is better. IMO, it would have been the first, and not only because it would have made the film 'normal duration'. One more thing: it is disappointing having one of the best story tellers in the history of cinema use an off-screen voice to connect between the parts, and -yes!- help us understand the 'moral' of the story. Even the low age spectators could do without off-screen voice if the story is coherent and the right artistic means are put in use. There are certainly some other very good parts, memorable characters (including, but not limited to the android kid who is the main character), some camera angles which will make it in future anthologies. However, for me, on Spielberg expectations scale this film is a disappointment",A.I. Artificial Intelligence
33,ThomasDrufke,"Daring, but Overrated",5,15 April 2014,"I don't think there is a person on the planet who doesn't love Steven Spielberg, or can at least appreciate all he has done for cinema. He has directed and produced so many classic films, and most notably for the Science Fiction genre. But I have to say, I think A.I is overrated. And to be quite frank it becomes a mess midway through. I thought the movie would be the boy trying to fit into his new family and the trials and tribulations. But once the mother leaves him it dives into an unsatisfying territory.Without any true stars leading the film besides perhaps Jude Law, your stuck with Haley Joel Osment, who his best role is still Pay it Forward in my opinion. I realize he is a robot, but he becomes whiny for most of the movie. But there were parts I really did enjoy. The scenes with the mother were a definite highlight. In particular, the ending scene with him laying there with his 'mommy' served as a pleasing ending to an overall disappointing sci-fi.I was completely thrown off by the Aliens who come in 2000 years later. I just thought I was going to see a movie near the same vein as the upcoming Transcendence and not some 'Aliens take over our world after we all die' type of movie. I also really hated the scenes with Jude Law. I think he's a great talent but his presence was goofy, even if he was just meant for comic relief.

I will say that this movie is one of his weaker films, but I liked it enough.The story takes place in the future. All the coastal cities have been flooded so the world's population lives inland. Some of that population are robots. A robot has been created to love and is sent to live with a family. He eventually gets kicked out and is forced to redeem himself by living in the woods.The acting is very good. This is not an all-star cast, but a good one nonetheless. Haley Joel Osment surprised me. Jude Law did pretty good. William Hurt had some great scenes.John Williams always impresses me with his fantastic scores. This one is one of his better ones and it should have won an Oscar.I liked the characters in this film. They were well-explained. Teddy is possibly my favorite character.This movie has a potential to be a 10/10, but there are some long, boring scenes.

35,ericstevenson,He got what he wanted,9,24 July 2017,"I have been wanting to see this movie for a very long time and not just for Nostalgia Critic Month. It's weird how I consider this to be the best movie I've reviewed for this month, seeing as how it drove the Critic himself kind of crazy. Anyway, I for one loved the ending and found it very clever. It's weird how he complained about how sappy it was, when really it wasn't. This movie features a robot boy named David who wants to be human. His mother lets him run away instead of having him destroyed, so he tries to find the blue fairy he heard about in ""Pinocchio"" so he can become a real boy. He finds a statue in an amusement park and spends two thousand years waiting.Creatures come and bring the statue to life and can bring David's mother back, but only for one day. I mean, David is still going to be alone for the rest of eternity and humanity itself is doomed at this point. I really didn't find this ending to be that sappy at all. That is still one of my favorite Nostalgia Critic episodes. Why? Because he goes into so much detail about how Stanley Kubrick wanted this ending and Steven Spielberg worked so hard to make a friend's dream come true. If only he had done that for ""Bridge To Terabithia"" which is sincerely an even better movie. This is my favorite movie for Nostalgia Critic Month.The effects are top notch. There are just so many strong moments in this film, especially when David is separated from his mother. I remember when this movie came out and how much controversy it stirred. Some people loved it, while others found it dumb. I'm obviously the former. It's weird how this film can be compared to ""Bicentennial Man"" because Robin Williams was in this movie too! Yeah, he knows about a robot wanting to be human. This film was a lot better because of how it was more sincere and just better looking. It's great to know that the great Stanley Kubrick had his dream achieved, even if he never lived to see it. ***1/2",A.I. Artificial Intelligence

It's an enjoyable movie that is impressively directed by the great Steven Spielberg, bringing a world where robots reign supreme to life, its certainly intriguing as, nowadays, this future no longer seems too distant. Haley Joel Osment shines in another role that shows he had genuine acting talent at a young age, however, Jude Law steals the show, as he has clearly put in an immense amount of work to portray an animatronic who is very human, Teddy is also a very lovable character and great addition to the story. I did feel the film did not know who its audience was, it was too intense to be a family movie, but not thrilling enough to be a delight for adults, this made the story feel bland, as it was neither joyful nor terrifying. The biggest issue is that the plot was developed by Stanley Kubrick, but then directed by Spielberg in the end after the directors passing, their outlook is simply too different, Kubrick is bleak and Spielberg is optimistic, which makes their style entirely different, as a result of that, the story simply feels uneven. Not without its flaws, A.I. Artificial Intelligence is still a well acted, enjoyable Sci-Fi, worth the watch if you ever stumble upon it on television or some other medium.

At once, Henry sees an opportunity to help Monica and he buys the first robot boy, David (Haley Joel Osmet). In his instructions are a set of verbal commands which will ""imprint"" David's love for Monica irreversibly. Initially opposed to his acquisition, Monica grows to love him, as her heart is hurting. Unexpectedly, a cure for Martin's disease is discovered and he comes home, completely well. Immediately, Martin begins to taunt and trick David as they both compete for their mother's love. Eventually, Martin has a serious accident, at David's hands, so Monica knows he cannot stay. But, although the company's instructions were for the robot-boy to be returned and destroyed, she can't do it. Instead, she takes him out to the woods and abandons him and his ""supertoy"" talking Teddy. The real horror is about to begin, for not only does David need the love of his mother but the poorer folks gather wandering robots and destroy them in an ancient Roman type arena. David is seized and so is Gigolo Joe (Jude Law), a robot who was ""framed"" for murder. What will be their fate? The plot is so complicated, it is difficult to do it justice but it is fairly fascinating. And, the movie starts off with a real jolt and continues on until the final quarter, where it loses steam and credibility. The cast is really great, with Osmet a wonder as the robotic child and beautiful O'Connor an object of pity and scorn as the confused mother. Law, too, is quite fine as the futuristic robot-lover and all other cast members do nice work, too, although Hurt has only two major scenes. The look of the film is an even stronger asset, as its artistic direction and special effects are terrific, creating a world like few others and a marvel to behold. The scenes of robot destruction are fairly potent, as the robots look like human beings, so be cautious about letting young children watch it. Also, the ending is controversial, with the likelihood that some viewers will like it, others will not. But, if you adore science fiction, Spielberg or well-crafted effects, you should do the intelligent thing and rent this one in the near future.",A.I. Artificial Intelligence
39,Bored_Dragon,A classic for all generations,10,29 October 2016,"The story is a futuristic combination of ""Pinocchio"" and ""Wizard of Oz"" that ends in the ambient of ""Day After Tomorrow"". The complete atmosphere of this movie reminded me of a strange mix of ""Clockwork Orange"" and ""2001: A Space Odyssey"", and if I didn't know it was Spielberg's movie I could swear that it was Kubrick. Later I did some digging and found out that the movie originally was indeed Kubrick's. Kubrick was working on this project for 12 years and involved Spielberg later on. Work on it started in 1993, but Kubrick died before it was done and Spielberg took over and finished the job. The mixture of Spielberg and Kubrick elements is obvious in the movie, but it is really tricky to tell which one of them did what part. Obviously Spielberg's ending is actually Kubrick's original idea from the first version, even before Spielberg had anything to do with this project. Ministry was also Kubrick's idea. He was a fan and he personally called them to offer them a part in the movie. The first time he called, the Ministry singer thought it was someone screwing with them and he hung up the phone.""A.I."" combines drama, action, mystery, and even some elements of horror, into an irresistible adventure that leaves a deep impression and provokes thinking. Effects, directing, editing, music, and most of all, depth of the story, make this movie one of the best achievements of the new millennium, and in my opinion, it should be included in all lists of best movies of all times.10/10",A.I.

40,ironhorse_iv,The Sci-Fiction version of Pinocchio was wooden and unpleasant. Artificial Indifferent.,6,16 June 2013,"This movie wasn't very interesting in my opinion. It was just downright sad, and depressing. Based on Brian Aldiss's short story ""Super-Toys Last All Summer Long"". The movie follows the story of David (Haley Joel Osment), a robot boy uniquely programmed with the ability to love looking for love. Abandoned by the mother Monica (Frances O'Connor), he is programmed to care about. In an attempt to gain Monica's love and acceptance, David becomes determined to find the blue fairy from the story Pinocchio so he can become a real boy. This film has always been pet project for Director Stanley Kubrick since the 1970's. The film development suffered years, partly because Kubrick felt CGI was not advanced enough to create the story. In 1995, Kubrick handed the project to his friend Steven Spielberg. Under Spielberg, the project never gain any momentum Kubrick's death in 1999. Since the death of Kubrick, Steven Spielberg felt like making the film would be a tribute to his friend's filmmaking career. What we got wasn't a film for the audience, but a film for his friend. Spielberg made the film as he believed Kubrick would have wanted it, to the best of his abilities, and no matter how well he pulled it off, he would have been screwed by the audience due many factors. It's a mix between Kubrick's chilly bleakness and Spielberg's warm-hearted optimism to the point that the film is lost in the direction it wants to go. Surprising, it's seem to me, that the directors switch roles, with Spielberg wanting the film to be all dark and tragedy, while Kubrick wanting to do a more family friendly movie. The beginning and the end is all Kubrick's ideas. So what we got was two different movies, playing as one. The logistics of this movie are just silly and there is so little charm that I cannot look past. Based on my own opinion, I didn't find David to be very entertaining. I just found him creepy. Haley Joel Osment did a great job portraying an android, but it didn't had the charm of the 1999's Six Sense film. It was a void of a performance because of that factor. It's a robot. If the robot had more human characteristic, it might have been not as boring. I found Gigolo Joe (Jude Law) more entertaining than David. Why wouldn't he have a movie about him? He has a very interesting story. He's in trouble because he's framed for a murder by a jealous ex-lover, and thus, is on the run. That would be more a story, than this silly Pinocchio rip-off. Why not have HAL 9000!? I think he's more human that David. Ever since he died, Kubrick's films have been subjected to a wealth of analysis, writers hitting upon hidden meanings everywhere. The movie felt like a very dark vacuum of nothing, no hope and no reason to hope for. The movie has that Mary Shelley's Frankenstein feel to it, humans discard the moral and ethical of creating life without thinking of the very thing need to create that life: love. I felt the cruelty of the human characters in this story was incredible. I mean absolutely cruel and callous. There were very few likable characters and it hurt the film. For David to ever quest for Monica's attention, is like watching a domestic abuse victim wanting attention from her abuser. There were hundreds of different ways than abandoning David. Reprogram him, change the settings, wipe his memory, adjusted his abilities. Any parent that abandoned isn't worth being a parent in the first place. I don't like Monica as character, and for David to seek her out is sick. They stick to the people that treat them bad, because they feel like they deserve that treatment. Maybe it's a metaphor for children seeking closure and forgiveness after a parent abandons them so it makes David more human. I don't know, but to me it seems like an awful idea for expectations that will just be shattered. That's why for me, it was hard watching this film. I didn't want David to find the Blue Fairy, because I thought Monica wasn't a good mother in the first place to gain his love. I like the ending with the truth was revealed that he will never get what he wants, but in the end, we got the cop out version. Kubrick was the one who wrote the extra 15 minutes 2000 years in the future, against the suggestions of fellow writers. Spielberg decided to keep it to best realize the vision of his friend. It isn't a sweet ending scene at all. It's really quite tragic as well. The 'double ending' was what drove the final nail in the coffin for me. Visual, the movie was wonderful. The score by John Williams amazing. The acting is great, but overall, it was a no-win situation for Steven Spielberg. Don't get me wrong, it's not the worst movie from Steven Spielberg. As much as critic want to say its Steven Spielberg's fault that he ruined what was presumably Kubrick's vision. It wasn't Spielberg that add all the cheesy, emotional business. It was Stanley Kubrick's mistake. Stanley Kubrick might have reach God like levels since dying, that might angry some of his fans if you find anything about him to criticize, but he was pretty human to me. While I am a huge fan of Kubrick's work, I just don't like this film. But if you enjoy it, then more power to you. I felt like my time was wasted.",A.I. Artificial Intelligence

It tells the story of a young robot boy who wants to become real, almost like a fairy tale, and his quest is quite emotional.",A.I. Artificial Intelligence
43,Dr_Coulardeau,Man should cultivate his natural intelligence,10,16 February 2009,"This is an amazing film because it reveals why we, humans, should not play with artificial intelligence. To make robots that look like human beings to the point of being fooled completely by them is a rather easy task. But that robot is nothing but a machine as long as it does not have human feelings and first of all the capacity to love. The second drawback of such robots is that they do not grow or age. If you give the capacity to love to a child robot, he will be able to love but not to grow. He will remain a child forever though his love will grow more and more intense since it will feed on non-material energy. The genial element Steven Spielberg introduces in that story is a competition with a real boy and the subsequent disposing of the robot by the woman he calls his mother. He then attaches himself to fairy tales, to Pinocchio and the Blue Fairy who could change him into a real boy. That turn in the tale transforms the story that could have become over-sentimental into a magical and deeply ethical story. We discover what humanity would do as soon as such human robots existed. It would organize hunts to catch the stray ones, the abandoned ones, those chased by the police or any authority for crimes they had not committed but they had been made guilty of by the real criminals to save their own skins. The presence of these robots would cover up a new wave of crime that could go unpunished. So the human beings could organize some circus games with these robots as gladiators, but not gladiators who would die after a severe and honorable fight, but as sacrificial victims on the altar of the human dignity that is infringed by those robots. Shower them with acid, throw them through fire and through fans, hack them down with saws or all kinds of axes, etc. In front of that horrible fate, our boy and his gigolo of a partner on this trip will manage to escape due to a last breath of humanity in the audience of those games that will liberate them. And off they go to the big city of games, rides, casinos, brothels, music-halls and so many other attractions essentially performed by robots of all types. They are looking for the Blue Fairy. Then their trip will take them to underwater New York, the twin towers proudly dominating a sea of water. There David, our little robot, meets with his creator and escapes to the underwater world where he discovers the Blue Fairy of Coney Island where he is trapped by some accident and survives two thousand years of freezing which will bring the water down of course. That shows how absurd a project of producing robots who can feel and express sentiments is: these robots are bound to suffer at the hands of humans and many humans are bound to become cruel and sadistic, and to suffer in return, when confronted with the extreme demands in love and passion of these robots. But the film goes one step further and makes the story finally luminous. Extra-terrestrials arriving on earth and discovering the lost civilization of the earth completely wasted in the vastly human produced or amplified glaciation. These extra-terrestrials have powers that enable them to read the memory and the most subtle desires of David and to recreate the environment in which he met with maternal and filial love. But his demand to have his mother resurrected raises a question. When one has run one's time, if you revive or resurrect them then they are what they were at the end of their time, and that is dead because they cannot live beyond their time span. Then the story becomes full of sunshine. The young David will keep his desire and his demand, even though it will be entirely artificial and will only last from sunrise to sundown. And there maybe he will be a real boy when he goes to sleep with his mother who will go to sleep for ever. He will, so Steven Spielberg says, finally visit the world where dreams are born. Does it mean he will not wake up? Does it mean he will wake up but the recollection of this day with his mother will be the dream he needs to go on living, and maybe discover new forms of love or new people, even Extra Terrestrials, he could love? We don't know. Steven Spielberg ends his story on a sleeping boy going to dream and a sleeping mother going to eternal inexistence. Why on earth do we want to create robots that can feel sentiments when we have so many human beings around us we could love, which would improve our society and our world?

44,johnnyboyz,"A dramatic, frightening piece; with a real air of both mystery and tragedy at the centre of it all. AI is worth seeing.",7,25 December 2009,"You can see the flashes of genius in Spielberg's 2001 film Artificial Intelligence: AI, the flashes of genius that Kubrick himself would have been proud of. The project began life as a Kubrick feature, but was handed over to Spielberg who then fittingly rounded the piece off following Kubrick's death. I think the film would've sat quite nicely with the already vast collection of widely recognised great films the man made. As it happens, Artificial Intelligence: AI is a film that manages to combine ideas, themes and writing that produces genuine emotion with the latest and greatest in special effects to deliver something close to remarkable. The film is a wild; all encompassing; unpredictable and adventure fuelled tale of a young cyborg boy on a Pinocchio infused journey to uncover who, or what, the Blue Fairy is, and where they're based so that the boy may become 'real'. To merely say that it is quite the visual and emotional experience, would be understating it somewhat.Haley Joel Osment plays the young, robotic boy of the title; a certain David who's initially adopted by the Swinton family in the 22nd Century, the husband and father of which is named Henry; and is an employee at the company that has made David. David's purpose is to come across as son-like and as real as possible, thus injecting love and well-being into the household he's assigned to. Any complaints or criticisms in the past about whoever in regards to child actors coming across as wooden, or robotic, in their skills sort of take a jab back here, as the child-actor lead is indeed, a robot in what is a performance by Osment which works.David is a son that doesn't need feeding, educating, sleep nor too much attention in regards to constantly keeping it entertained. It creeps about, it follows its newly acquired family and it does and says simplistic things. After a while, David's presence sparks off a troublesome relationship with the Swinton's real son, a certain Martin whose problems with disease have rendered him half machine anyway by way of his artificial legs. Martin and David's antagonism is born out of Martin's sadistic and naive response to the new family member, further instilling a somewhat unfortunate sense of humans being ill suited to the technology on display. These sequences also get across a sense of who are the real individuals you ought to be afraid of; a sense that Martin is nastier and more frightening than David is, despite David's collection of initial eerie, ominous scenes and actions. What these early house-set sequences tap into, is the human race's supposed difficulty in dealing with technology and modernity they themselves have created and allowed to spill out into the hands of others whom are either unsure of it, or might misuse it. It's here a somewhat sly allegory to the sorts of weapons certain nations have access to, or are supposedly in the process of creating, might be read into.As the film appears to be bedding down into a household set; domestically driven; family orientated drama about human beings, and their (in)ability to co-exist with machines in an ever changing world, it jumps ship and broadens out to become something else entirely. The film adopts a relatively routine, familiar even, arc of the singular strand variety; that is to say it is a raw character study of how one individual will cover a number of different locales, forever discovering himself and things about other people as they get ever closer to their goal. David's journey takes him from a down-to-Earth home in the 22nd Century; to the 22nd Century equivalent of a red light district; to some sort of derby gathering during which old and worn out robots are blown apart for sake of entertainment (which sounds like the premise for some more recent, inferior science fiction films); right the way through to ocean covered, post-apocalyptic cities and the items buried deep within the fathoms.David's journey sees him accompanied, on and off, by two other machines; both of whom are designed to serve human beings in some form, and one of whom struggles in this role in what is a further example of the clashes between man and machine when they have an altercation with a human that'll see them go on the run from the law. This character is Gigolo Joe, a sweet talking; built in jukebox sporting; male prostitute droid played by Jude Law, while the far smaller Teddy (Angel), a mere child's toy, talks in a monotone manner expressing the best possible course of action as David flits from one set up to another. Teddy's low-key and gruff, electronic voice complete with constant referencing to the lead by his very name, 'David', echoes HAL's referencing of another respective lead, by way of 'Dave', from a past Kubrick feature.Like that respective film; Artificial Intelligence: AI begins at one point, a relatively low key and familiar enough domestic locale, before branching way off the beaten path and into the uncharted realms of the fantastical. It isn't quite the experience of 2001: A Space Odyssey, beginning at the dawn of mankind and going right the way through to everything that came with that respective film's finale, but it's of that scope and of that aspiration. There's a lot of ground for the characters to cover in Artificial Intelligence: AI, both physically and emotionally, and the film never allows the spectacle of its locations and special effects to overwhelm nor consume the heart-felt, often harrowing quest the lead is going on. This achievement, on top of what is a riveting and heart-felt adventure, is enough to recommend the film to a pretty high degree.",A.I. Artificial Intelligence
45,leplatypus,Artist Indisputable (DVD),7,28 September 2008,"Spielberg done it again! Each movie I discover from him, I always said ""Best movie of the year"" or ""It's his best"". But the next one comes, and I repeat those statements. Honestly, he is the Greatest Filmmaker (and storyteller) of all times and I owe him my most precious moments of emotions! Thanks!The feat is all the more astounding than as always, there's nothing really new, as he kept talking about the same thematic again and again. So in ""AI"", you will find the Child point of view, the Pursuit of Dreams, the Belief in outside Life, the Human Oppression and the meaning of LoveI understand why Spielberg said the story was amazing: it's a worthy heir of any fairy tales and Pinochio in particular. In an actual world more and more robotic, less words and more pictures, I would share this DVD with my kids (if I had any) as night stories!Don't be fooled by the first thirty minutes: it's the more ""kubrickian"" part with cold and silent moments. Maybe it would have been better if the parents were big names instead of unknown cast (for me). But after, it's really amazing: it's a remake of ""ET"" arriving on earth, the Martian pods attacks under a beautiful moonlight! Then, it's the turn to ""Empire of the sun"" and ""Schindler's list"" to appear! Then, you watch a kind of ""Blade-Runner 2"" before going into the last days of Earth! The final is very intimate with the same deep message of ""2001"" or ""Encounter""!In other words, you got wonderful shots, unforgettable sets and art direction, coupled with great philosophical reflexion: what about mother love, brother competition, human identity, chasing dreams forever. This speaks to me for years and it's great to see that's mean a lot for other people too.Examples: · When a crowd of rednecks torture helping tools, are they sill human? · When a robot cry for his mom, is still a robot? · What's the difference between of a serial line of robots and busy black suits of human workers?I don't know very much Kubrick but with ""AI"", Spielberg is close to Philip K. Dick, that's close to the best to human side. They said some deep truths disguised in flashy effects of science-fiction. Could they only peel away this fantasy for a straight normal story.",A.I.

48,funkyfry,"Intelligent film, somewhat poor execution",6,27 July 2006,"I have to warn the reader, that I was pre-disposed not to like this film. That's because I had heard about this film initially in the early 90s, when I was in high school and was just discovering the timeless joys of Stanley Kubrick films. I heard at that time he was working on ""A.I."" as well as ""Eyes Wide Shut."" Then I heard the news a few years later that he was going to do ""EWS"" first and then do ""AI"". When I heard the news of Mr. Kubrick's death just prior to the release of ""EWS"", I was standing in the lobby of the now-defunct Berkeley UC Landmark Theater about to watch a double feature of ""Persona"" and ""Wild Strawberries"". Very fitting I suppose. One of the first thoughts that came to my mind was a kind of profound sadness ""I'll never get to see AI. Nobody will ever get to see AI."" So why has it taken me so long to see it? Why was I not the first in line? I don't really like Steven Spielberg's films. And I think it was disingenuous of him to imply in interviews that he and Kubrick had planned to make the movie all along, while in actual fact Spielberg had abandoned the project in favor of ""Jurassic Park 2"" many years ago. I see Spielberg as a vulture, basically, trying to get some of Kubrick's reflected glory.But every time I talked about Spielberg and the film, people here would rightly tell me that I should see the film before I talk trash about it. I agree, but it's against my aesthetic philosophy to watch a movie intentionally to dissect or criticize it. So I tended to stay away, especially after seeing the horrible ""Minority Report"" which kind of ruined Phil Dick's story.This one is a Phil Dick imitation also. It bears very little resemblance ot the Aldiss story as far as I can recall it. But it's an excellent idea in many ways, a sci-fi Pinoccio, and the execution is uneven but more or less emotionally sound. It's torturous almost in an existential way to imagine this poor boy has been programmed to love a woman who turns out to be such a flaming B**$!!@. I enjoyed the story element with his jealousy of ""Teddy"" and his growing affection for him throughout the story. It was painful to see teddy sitting at the table and to realize that the family really saw David as nothing but a sophisticated toy, while for David the family was the ultimate meaning of the world. It forms a strong plea for empathy.The scenes at the giant robot killing rally were also very impressively done, except in the sense that the crowd changed sides much too fast, and then we didn't even really see how they rescued David and his friend. Brendan Gleeson was very impressive, but I didn't believe that the crowd would turn from supporting him 100% to hating him 100% in a few seconds. In terms of the performances in general, they were solid. Osment should be singled out for praise because he manages to effect the character transitions required by the role. Jude Law was the only one I thought was kind of weak, he really did not make me care for his character the way I think we were supposed to.My main problem with the movie comes in the finale. I actually think possibly it would have been a better film if it had ended with him underwater watching the blue fairy. Spielberg made the same mistake he always makes, to explain and show too much. It wasn't quite as happy as the usual Spielberg movie ending though. I think it could have been fine if they had skipped the whole part with the aliens explaining to David about the whole ""she can only come back for one day"" thing. First of all, it doesn't make sense. Second of all, the audience does not need that much information. And certainly to give it in dialog exposition was a show of weakness and Spielberg's tendency to underestimate the audience. I think it would have been more powerful if we had never actually seen David talk to the aliens, or if they had disguised themselves as the blue fairy and given him a lot less information. If you think about the ending Kubrick probably envisioned, it was probably a lot more along the lines of the ending of ""2001"" where you do not have any dialog and you let the audience connect the dots and draw conclusions for themselves. Spielberg is afraid to do this.All in all though, a successful film that combines Spielberg's talents as an emotive director who elicits empathy with a more adult story than usual from him.",A.I.

49,Anonymous_Maxine,A.I. is a perfect example of negative criticism born from expectations based on assumption or ignorance.,10,6 July 2001,"That's right, Steven Spielberg is back. He has taken it upon himself to helm the story started years and years ago by the late Stanley Kubrick, and Kubrick's influence is strikingly clear, especially late in the film. A lot of people were put off by A.I., but this is because they expected a cute kids movie, something in the tradition of E.T. I don't know, maybe it's the fact that both movies have initials in the titles that caused this association. Spielberg is no stranger to dark content. I don't think I need to take the time to explain the content of much of Saving Private Ryan or Schindler's List or even pars of Jurassic Park. Before I saw A.I., I read that Spielberg described the tone as what you would get if E.T. had been killed and dissected by the scientists, or if he had never recovered from that mysterious disease. This is a surprisingly accurate description of what you get with the film, so be warned! Don't come out disappointed because of false expectations, as I'm sure is the case with soccer moms around the world. The other thing that people are likely to criticize A.I. for is the almost uncomfortable closeness with which the film parallels the Pinocchio story in many ways. Sure it does that, but it never pretends that it doesn't. On the other hand, you have to keep in mind that this is also a tremendously different version of the Pinocchio story. This is not the story of a puppet, made for entertainment, miraculously attaining consciousness and emotions and wanting to be a real boy, it's the story of a hugely advanced artificially intelligent robot, created to love and comfort humans, attaining consciousness and emotions and wanting to be a real boy.(spoilers) The thing to remember here is the extent to which reality was considered when creating a film with such a fantastical premise. Sure, this is science fiction, but one of the greatest pitfalls of the sci fi genre is the excessive dismissal of reality. In A.I., everything that can go wrong, does go wrong, and it's a good thing, because that's life. Monica decides to keep little David (Osment), but then her real son comes out of his coma, which no one expected. Needless to say, all sorts of complications come as a result. Martin (Monica's son) treats David with all of the inhumanity and cruelty as he would treat any lifeless toy. He has no respect for David's feelings, and while this does not seem to bother David, it does have an impact on the development of his emotions. Later on, we find out how hated these androids are by real humans, we see them destroyed, we see them rotting in dumps filled with sickening body parts, where damaged and mutilated robots wander, in search of replacement parts.This is not a perfect futuristic world, although it is a lot cleaner and more optimistic than the future presented in the majority of science fiction films. The emphasis here is not placed on making everyone happy.  You won't walk away from the film with a contented smile on your face, everything does not go as planned, and no one lives happily ever after. In fact, the end of the film runs the risk of ruining the rest of it, the way the end of Mission to Mars absolutely wrecked what was otherwise a decent sci fi film. The unimaginably advanced machines of 2000 years in the future are at first frighteningly disappointing, but also strangely beautiful (they look like machinery encased in flawless glass...) and not entirely beyond reason. They may have been a little too computer animated, but they ultimately served their purpose well. Haley Joel Osment gives a stunning performance as David, he even surpasses his excellent performance in the great film The Sixth Sense. Haley Joel is on his way to big things. The special effects were spectacular, both with all of the machines as well as the scenery and also the little things, like the great character Teddy.  Teddy was a much better character than Wilson in Cast Away, by the way.  And Jude Law gave a strangely refreshing performance as Gigolo Joe, the lover robot who also ends up inadvertently as David's fortunate sidekick. With A.I., Steven Spielberg has taken his uncanny ability to please huge numbers of people and mixed it with Stanley Kubrick's uncanny ability to perplex huge numbers of people, and the result is a tremendously pleasing film that unfortunately went completely misunderstood by a substantial portion of the audience. There can be no mistake about the quality of this movie, but the subject matter is something that today's spoiled audiences are not likely to swallow too easily. Modern cinema is so sugar coated and drab that people just can't take it when a little robot boy spends 2000 years in a stolen police helicopter at the bottom of the ocean, pleading to a lifeless statue to make him into a real boy. If you just can't stand not having a bright side, consider the fact that if she had made him real, he would have died. The movie ends in death, but it is a desired death. It is a rest for a robot who has searched for closure for all those years, much like what was seen in the far inferior Bicentennial Man. If you hated the movie, I'm sorry to hear it, but I can say with reasonable certainty that it's because you didn't understand it or you had unjustifiable expectations. Watch it again with an open mind, and enjoy this excellent film for what it is. Steven Spielberg was obviously not concerned with making everyone happy when he wrote the screenplay for A.I., he was concerned with telling a good story, and that's exactly what he did.",A.I.

It's set in a future where global warming has led to ecological disaster of rising sea levels and a drastic reduction of the human population. Yet humankind never learns the vanity and contrivance in its advances, as it attempts a short cut to maintaining civilization with the creation of android artificial intelligence. These efforts culminate with the creation of David, an android child programmed with the ability to love, played by Haley Joel Osment.This is merely the circumstantial context serving as the innate and thus the only possible landscape for A.I's extrasensory odyssey through the mechanisms of feelings, scientific projections, and the shame and ignorance inherent in many human beings. Imagine your mother, and how much you love her. Imagine being a small child again. Spielberg has portrayed childlike wonder and innocence before, but never to such a crushingly tender degree, as Osment becomes so alive to us that we not only invest an enormous amount of sympathy in him but we also begin to straddle incredibly fascinating concepts involving the existence of a robot, like the idea of being alive for thousands of years and never going to sleep, or contradiction of the ability to process information and the restriction to follow a program.The movie's eccentricity is built by the strange character played by Jude Law, a male prostitute robot who is on the run after being framed for murder, and those of William Hurt, the professor responsible for commissioning the creation of Osment's robotic boy, and Brendan Gleeson's cameo as the ringleader at the Flesh Fair, where useless robots are destroyed before cheering crowds not unlike those at rodeos or wrestling matches, and the setting of a Las Vegas-like metropolis where rogue robots go about an urban life of vices. This all spreads a thick spectrum of unfathomable lack of category, and only the least genre- restricted film is placed under bottomless measures, and when its story progresses, its design, ambiance, music, drama and humor unravel before us, if we feel ourselves enthralled in it all, then all status drops from it, a true and impervious contribution to the farthest reaching extent of cinema.Though its strange unpredictability presses it away from other films like Bicentennial Man, I Robot, Blade Runner, and other Spielberg sci-fi films like Close Encounters, E.T. or Minority Report, with which many have pigeonholed it, it is not the explosively effective vital to the film's boundless spirituality unto true understanding, expansive exaltation. It is Spielberg's ecstatic, sympathetic and matronly heart, which drenches this film, that makes you gush with tears, ache in your threat, cause your nose to run, both igniting the waterfall of one's love for the maternal and unite one with an enlightened, joyous envisioning of the future, wherein Spielberg is accepting of what the majority of the human race dreads, having confronted those fears beyond imagining and conceived a selfless greatness in the races to come.",A.I.

52,FiendishDramaturgy,Spielberg forges a diamond,10,28 August 2003,"Starting with Kubrick's genius should have made this work a ""snap."" Upon Kubrick's death Spielberg picked up the project begun by Kubrick, and proceeded as planned. I must say that like the rest of the mainstream world, I love Haley Joel Osment's younger performances. He has never let me down, as a movie goer. If he is in a production, I can rest assured that his performance, if nothing else, will redeem the money spent. Haley Joel Osment is, in fact, a bright and shining NOVA in his portrayal of the futuristic Peter Pan; the little boy who could never grow up. It is a whimsical, beautiful, tragic masterpiece of a performance to match the same qualities in this production. Whimsical. Tragic. Beautiful. A Masterpiece.No spoilers, nothing else about the movie itself. I bought it before I'd seen it because of the wonderful review it got from my love, and I watched it. It's been on the shelf ever since. I don't ever want to see it again. It broke my heart so thoroughly that I don't ever need to see it again. I will never forget it. This is a definite must see for anyone with a heart.It's worth a 9.8/10 from...the Fiend :.",A.I. Artificial Intelligence
53,jtindahouse,Waste of Money!!!,5,6 September 2004,In my opinion this movie is one of the worst ever made. It was a great idea for a story but was completely butchered by how complicated they made it. They didn't need to make it complicated. It could have been the most simple and yet exciting film of the year but that's not what they went for. I think the main problem the writers felt they had with making it simple would have been how long it was. A movie made for adults as this was is generally expected to be around about 2 hours and I think the writers felt inclined to do that. While the movie was shocking the acting was superb. Especially from young Hayley Joel Osment who I'm told didn't blink throughout the movie which is just outstanding.,A.I. Artificial Intelligence
54,dfranzen70,Artificial plot,4,16 March 2002,"Overlong and pretentious, this movie is a basic retelling of the classic Pinocchio story, set in the distant future. In this one, the ""Pinocchio"" is an advanced robot who looks and acts like a real boy. David (Haley Joel Osment) is the first of his robot line to have actual feelings, and naturally he runs into problems reconciling these emotions with his logical side.   David is purchased by the Swinton family as a sort-of replacement for their son, who lies in stasis, stricken by an incurable disease. Mr. Swinton (Sam Robards) buys David to help his wife deal with the stress of losing their son; but it's kind of the same as buying a new puppy immediately after one's dog has been killed. Monica Swinton (Frances O'Connor) doesn't quite know what to make of the new addition to her family. She resents the intrusion, and doesn't know how to treat David. Unlike traditional serving robots, David is designed to be a cute little kid, which means he doesn't just sit back and wait for orders to be given; he's supposed to be more interactive and proactive, learning as he goes. David develops a real love for his adoptive mother. But when the younger Swinton actually is cured from his disease and returns home, things get very complicated. It's soon clear that David's days with the family are numbered. Monica knows that if David is returned to the manufacturer, he'll be taken apart, and she's also grown fond of the boy robot. She takes him to a huge forest where decommissioned androids and other robots wander, thinking he'll be better off with those of his own kind. But David's love for his mother outweighs all else, and through all of his adventures - in which he meets up with fellow robot Gigalo Joe (Jude Law), his one goal is to return to his beloved mommy. He is under the impression that he can somehow become a real boy, Monica will take him back and they can all live happily ever after. If you're in the mood for absurdist cinema, this is a treat. The special effects, which were nominated for an Oscar, really are good. But special effects aren't as special as they used to be, now that most big-budget films have them in some way. True, the makeup (by past Oscar winner Rick Baker) and costumes are excellent, but the story and acting, sadly, are not. Each scene elicits an ""oh, come on"" reaction, as it tries to top the previous scene. ""Look at me! Look at me!"" the scenes practically cry out. It's a self-absorbed mess. The theme's not a new one, but the makers of this piffle tried way too hard to make the story different from all of the other ""I want to be a real boy"" movies; there's a fine line between quirky and unbelievable.   Yes, you should suspend your disbelief for this movie; you should suspend it, expel it, and forget you ever had it. There's plenty that doesn't make a bit of sense, and a really schmaltzy ending. It tries its damnednest to pluck at your heartstrings, playing out more like a cheesy disease-of-the-week TV movie than a serious, heartfelt film. Osment's not bad, under the circumstances. One great thing about playing a robot is that one can give a poor performance, and it'll seem believable. There are also a few celebrity cameos that were completely unnecessary, although I won't ruin their surprise by outing them here. Most of the middle portion of this film (which clocks in at over two and a half hours) is deadeningly dull, and none of it was worth the megahype that DreamWorks mustered up for it. This is a good movie to leave on as you fall asleep.",A.I. Artificial Intelligence
55,meeza,For You Stanley!!!!!!!!,8,27 May 2002,"The late Director Stanley Kubrick utilized his grandiose intelligence in making some of the most peerless films of all time. Before his death, Kubrick started working on a film project about a robotic boy in the distant future, and his restless pursuit to become human.  The film's `Pinocchio'-theme story was very intriguing and sophisticated; and that is no lie. If this project were to be completed, it had to be executed by another genius director that lacked artificial intelligence and had `close encounters' with this type of genre in the past. For that reason, I am glad that Director Steven Spielberg put this movie in `Spielberg's List' and decided to direct it. Spielberg's mystical futuristic direction style in `A.I.' receives an `A 1 A' grade in my book. The unconventional look of the film is just worth the price of admission. Haley Joel Osment, who stars as the robo-boy , executed a highly-skilled performance. His character's facial characteristics were of assiduous efforts. Haley's character did not blink throughout the entire film and kept his `eyes wide open'. I am sure the great stanley would have been very proud of his performance. Jude Law was very articulate as the mecha `Gigolo Joe' ( cool name!!!!!!!!!!!! ) . The only cinematic `law' that I think Spielberg broke was that he should have inserted Jude as Gigolo Joe into more scenes. Hey Jude! You are on your way in becoming one of the best young british actors today. Spielberg dedicated the film to Stanley Kubrick, and we thank the `amistad' they had together in bringing us `A.I.'. **** Good",A.I. Artificial Intelligence
56,drqshadow-reviews,The Ultimate Conflicted Identity Crisis,5,10 September 2012,"There's a great series of ethical questions just dying to be asked here, but they're buried beneath so many layers of glossy effects, shameless sentimentality and routine overacting, it's hard to say whether they're worth digging up. A.I. is quite Kubrickian at heart - complicated, fascinating and occasionally bizarre just for the sake of it - but also so thoroughly lathered with the strokes of Spielberg that it could almost function as a parody of his career. That duality is often mesmerizing, but also quite destructive. There are a few moments where this picture shines brighter for those combined efforts than it ever could under a single master, particularly in the fleshed-out world itself, but they're frequently outweighed by the long stretches where the two visions clash loudly and horribly - as the entire third act can attest. An aspirant, visually stunning genre-straddler, it's an uneven, long-winded showcase of the best traits and worst indulgences of both directors.",A.I. Artificial Intelligence

It raised a few hard questions on the ethics of sentient machines but isn't heavy handed with them.Doubtlessly a bit creaky and heavy handed, especially with the whole Pinocchio subtext. But it's weird enough, and filled with so many vivid images of a grotesque future, no less brutal for the technological advances.I'm not saying it's not campy and kind of stupid but that's better than boring.As shamelessly ridiculous as this movie is, I can't make too much fun of it since by the end I was balling like an infant.

58,Chris_Docker,Not the great movie it should have been but still worth seeing,7,1 October 2001,"A film with fantastic possibilities that is sadly flawed. Set well into the future, a cybernetics company makes the first life-like robot that is not only a boy child but imprints itself on the adopted mother and learns by developing responses based on love. Haley Joel Osmet largely has to carry the film and at times I felt his innocent questioning expression wasn't quite up to it. We go back to the banality, frequently admitted in the film that, at the end of the day, he is no more than a machine. The machine may be a therapeutic tool for a mother who has lost her only natural child, but beyond that? It seemed incomprehensible to me that such a society would develop with so little in the way of ethical codes of practice, and so seemed to put the film more firmly in the younger-audience market, yet some of the scenes would be unacceptable to those younger audiences. That leaves quite a narrow bracket of, say,  12 to 18 years. The dynamics of Mother-Child emotion are played out quite well at certain times, and it would probably be enjoyed by parents who don't shy away from the obvious cheesiness or the sci-fi trappings. The film's best part, for me, was the ingenious ending, that brings further elements into play and unexpectedly gives some food for thought - though not enough to justify nearly two and a half hours of cheesy comic-adventure. Very Spielberg, but not quite in the class of his all-time greats.",A.I. Artificial Intelligence
59,jimbo-53-186511,Patchy,6,13 June 2018,"Monica and Henry Swinton decide to adopt an 'AI' boy called David as they both fear that their son will never recover from his tragic accident. Although the Swintons initially struggle to adjust to David and his slightly unorthodox ways they gradually start to accept him as their own. However, when their own son Martin makes a recovery a rivalry ensues which forces Monica to abandon David which forces him to pursue his dream of becoming a real boy and being reunited with his 'mother'...The start of the film is intriguing in the sense that you're left wondering how an AI who is as close to being human as possible will interact with a normal family (which is part of Cybertronics master experiment and indeed part of the plot). This sets the tone well and creates some paranoia and intrigue - we're never quite sure how David will react to the family and vice versa. However, it loses itself slightly after a promising start...Once the Swinton's real son Martin is back with the family (he's seemingly cured from whatever happened to him with no real explanation) the film then becomes a pathetic point-scoring exercise between Martin and David - in fact many elements of the first half of the film (particularly between Martin and David) play out like Problem Child on Prozac which hardly makes for a particularly informative, interesting or engaging portion of the film.In the second half, it switches tone slightly in that David is now making it his quest to find the Blue Fairy as he believes that it is the Blue Fairy that can turn him from being a machine into a boy. In the second half we also get introduced to Joe (a camp-as-Christmas Don Juan who is a male gigolo). To be fair, Jude Law's excellent performance and his ridiculous character are the highlights of this film and what a shame it was that it was nearly an hour into the film before he showed up - he was great in every single scene in this film and made sure his screen time was memorable.The final third of the film is quite heart-wrenching and even a cold cynic like me found it quite moving (I won't say anymore than that, but those who have seen the film will know what I mean). It embosses the whole meaning of the film and what it was about and worked for me - although the cynic in me still thinks that Spielberg did manipulate the audience a bit as the script didn't really do enough to really do justice to the final act.Still pound for pound this worked for me and despite being a bit superficial, inconsistent in tone and generally all over the place the film did just about enough to win me over. It's not a great film by any means and certainly not as good as has been touted, but it's worth a look.",A.I. Artificial Intelligence

The movie is undoubtedly heartbreaking and thought provoking and forces us to think that are we really the best creation of the God?The acting in the movie is superb and Osment was the best, it was due to his superb acting and most the way he speaks through his eyes might melt the toughest of the heart. Jude Law and O'Connor were equally impressive.Direction of the movie is another strong aspect and the screenplay is gripping, it has it's tear-jerking moments which is touching and emotional, music and cinematography is also equally impressive.Over all this is a perfect Sci-Fi family movie which gives you a beautiful glimpse of the future, the movie can also impresses Sci-Fi lovers.

The monsters are humans, and they are nowhere nearly as civilized as robots. As in earlier robot films such as Blade Runner. we see that robots are superior to humans in every conceivable way; not just in strength and intelligence, but in emotional IQ as well. Although the film suffers from being too long, and needs more editing, it still packs an emotional wallop. The boy in the film, Osmet, is a gifted young actor, but that does not always translate to a successful adult career. Spielberg is, as usual, his sugary self, and the direction wanders from time to time. If truth be known to David, he should have opted to stay a robot, and not desire to be a human, because robots are superior in every way. But it hard to defeat the fantasies of childhood.",A.I.

63,dwpollar,Strange Spielberg experiment...,4,26 November 2008,"1st watched 11/25/2008 -(Dir-Steven Spielberg): Strange Spielberg experiment of what would happen if a robot child was programmed to love. The movie strays way too much from this main theme to make it a watchable film despite it's promising premise. The movie does have it's good moments but many other un-necessary bad moments outweigh the good. The basic storyline is about a future where robots are made in bunches and encouraged to be done because of global warming and less space to occupy humans. There has never been a robot made that could love until David, played by Haley Joel Osment, is introduced and is manufactured to forever love the parents who adopt him. The new couple that is chosen is perfect because they lost their son(supposedly) and would probably love the child back. Unfortunately their real son makes a recovery and in comes jealousy from the robot child and competition for the parents' love. The mother has bonded with the child and knows she needs to return it to the factory but instead abandons it on the way to the factory in a wooded area. At this point, the movie falls apart as far as credibility is concerned. A stupid decision by the mother brings about what we know is going to be confusion and disaster for the child. David hooks up with a lover robot, played by Jude Law, to be his friend but this character is weak and cartoon like and doesn't help the story at all. David remembers the Pinocchio story read to him by his mother and begins a quest for the blue fairy so that he can become a real boy and truly be loved by his mother. This quest is ridiculous, comical and switches into fantasy way too often giving us a mixed-up story. What could have been a good diversion into what would happen if a robot loved becomes a silly fantasy which tries to redeem itself in the end but faulters. This could have been a much better movie if Spielberg would have tugged the heart a little more and not wandered into fantasy land.",A.I. Artificial Intelligence
64,noralee,A Loving Tribute to Kubrick and Spielberg Movie Themes,6,13 December 2005,"""Artificial Intelligence"" is a love story about the movies, about the love of something artificial by something artificial. Don't we seem to love our movie characters more than real people? ""AI"" intentionally combines the iconic images of both Stanley Kubrick and Steven Spielberg, sometimes working together, sometimes conflicting, sometimes taking turns, with Spielberg the survivor as the victor.There are almost as many references to other movies as in ""Shrek,"" but here done with love and longing, not satire. The primary reference is to ""Wizard of Oz"" from a tarted up Emerald City (""Rouge City""), a search to get back home, asking a Wizard (""Dr. Know"") to lead them there. References fly by to movies such as ""Rosemary's Baby"" (with the ineffectual husband agreeing to bring a diabolical child into the family) to ""Mad Max at Thunderdome"" (with a post-apocalyptic violent cathartic entertainment) to finding a key remembrance in a pocket like Zuzu's petals. The mood music the Gigolo ""mecha"" plays are all soundtracks from movies (from Busby Berkeley movies to ""Guys and Dolls"").But as with ""Shrek"" there's also extended digs at Disney. While there's references to the scary flight in the woods from ""Snow White"" and the abandonment by Mom in ""Dumbo"" -- two of the scariest scenes in my childhood movie memories -- the two central tent poles are the source material for Disney animated classics, but challenging and combining them with different interpretations, ""Pinocchio"" (with readings from the original book - about another artificial boy who wants to be real) and yet another Spielberg re-visiting of ""Peter Pan"" (with an extended quote from the lyrics to ""Never Never Land"" about a boy who desperately wants a mother and doesn't want to grow up). Unlike ""Toy Story,"" these Super Toys stay alive when humans are around.The movie is also a tour through the careers of both Spielberg and Kubrick. The challenge that Spielberg explicitly lays down to Disney is that he wants to ""combine flat fact with fairy tale"" (i.e. a career statement from the guy who did ""E.T."" and ""Hook"" as well as ""Schindler's List"" and ""Saving Private Ryan""). There goes a spooky image from ""A Clockwork Orange,"" here comes ""Close Encounters of the Third Kind"" (including the music theme), here comes HAL, there goes ""E.T."". Spielberg takes the ending of"" 2001: A Space Odyssey"" and puts his own stamp on what the Star Child was all about.While movies like ""Princess Bride"" posit True Love as the strongest power in the universe, Spielberg instead sees it as the love of a child -- even an artificial child -- for its mother -- even though that love is programmed and the child finds (and rejects) the actual father who created him and loves him. (Sibling rivalry seems to be the second most powerful force, per Cain and Abel).While my husband was in tears at the conclusion, I found that by the time that ending came around after 2 1/2 hours of several false endings, I was feeling uncomfortable with the Oedipal thrust. My kids hated it.(originally written 6/30/2001)",A.I. Artificial Intelligence
65,Cristi_Ciopron,Switch to a preferable pace,7,2 May 2008,"Spielberg's new movies made him somehow more respectable for mewe are spared the gagspace of the Indiana/Back /Jurassic  days --the gagmetronome .I must say I abhor that syncopated artificial pace that one finds in Lucas' phony sagas as well. Spielberg's new films are also machineriesbut ,as such,better machineries than the ones he used to made.I have noticed that the movie buff Edward Peters does not include any of these new releases in his list of the best ten Spielberg films (in fact,'93 is the year of the newest film included there).Once he renounced that stupid charmless pace of his previous films, he seems to have been abandoned by at least a part of the older guard. The lack of the gagmetronome does not,of course,entitle his new films to any artistic pretensions. He was,in the '70s and '80s,together with Lucas (and ,later, Zemeckis), the predecessor and forbearer of the artificial trend in the adventure moviestrend that came to prevail in the '90s.Anyway,as I said, Spielberg and Lucas are the main responsible for this zany look of almost all the adventure movies of the last two decades. Somehow they devitalized the genreinflating it with a fake tendency that finished by ruining the whole. That's way most of the adventure films in the late '80s,in the '90s and nowadays are crap. Spielberg and Lucas launched the trend, they initiated this decadent fashion. Spielberg was indeed widely influential in the last 3 ½ decades of the cinemamuch to the commercial cinema's misfortune. In some way, him and Lucas gave the predominant postmodern trends a kind of commercial answer. Sophisticated machineries, at best, instead of the naive large toys of the previous decades.So, yeah, I credit him (and Lucas) with the ruin of the adventure cinema. A Cameron, a  are but the pupils.No one is,I believe,eager to denounce and to blame;yet, the things with the adventure movies are such.Spielberg's movies are kindred to the artificial, synthetic materials that pollute our world.In fact,they WERE:as they grew better,or at least became less bad,with his recent achievements.From this school, Robert Zemeckis' Romancing the Stone was probably I quite funny movie;yet such a flick itself bears the more than obvious marks of its relatedness to the main current.Back to :some things in it are quite good,of an almost Dickensian beauty and exploitation;or, they very well could have beenwith a less selfconscientious and selfimportant director.The Teddy toy is of great effect hereas a matter of fact,Teddy is an effect.Of course Spielberg isn't an author,in the sense Welles, Hitchcock and others are;his movies don't open into the miraculous beauty.Yet a few facts speak in his products' favor.Spielberg knows how to film children; this is obvious. He films very nicely children and toys.The scale,the inner scale of this movie,the spiral around which it is conceived,is surely the right one.You have the first ¾ hr. of interiors, etc.,while the scale is already set.In this,Spielberg proves better not only than Verhoeven (damn expectable), but also than Soderbergh.Spielberg gives some kind of dignity to the SF cinema.It boosts the notion,if I may say so.",A.I.

69,davidmvining,The best Kubrick movie made by someone not named Stanley Kubrick,8,22 November 2019,"TroublesBased on what I've read, the reason that Kubrick had so much trouble tackling the project was the central character of David, the robot built to love. I think he could never quite answer the question to himself of whether David was something capable of love or just a program, playing out in service to his programming. As the artist in charge of bringing the vision to screen, he needed a firm answer, which he was never able to provide himself.
When Spielberg took over, it feels like he jumped at an answer (yes, David's love is real), and started making the film. However, that answer that Spielberg presumably provides in the movie actually ends up going against some things that are deeper into the movie's intentions, those elements that maintain the question from Kubrick's mind through to the final product. And that contradiction is what ended up fascinating me most about the movie upon this first watch of the movie in over a decade.The First ActThe first act is one of the most Kubrickian pieces of filmmaking that Stanley Kubrick never lensed. The shot composition carries the kind of precision that Kubrick was famous for. The performances have a subtlety and exactness that feel as designed as anything anyone ever did for Kubrick. The scene of the first dinner with David, the robot before he is imprinted to love his mother, Monica, is so fulsomely Kubrick that I could believe it was filmed by his ghost.
In this first act, a grieving mother and father visit their real son who is cryogenically frozen as they await a cure to a life-threatening disease the boy carries. The father works for a major robotics company while his mother refuses to let go of her son. The head of the robotics firm offers a prototype robot to the family, one made in the form of a boy who is designed to love. They are beta-testers. Monica, the mother, is resistant to the very idea, but out of both curiosity and her own melancholy decides to keep the boy robot around. As she grows more fond of the little thing's quirks and she sees the possibility of finding some replacement for the boy she had lost, Monica imprints on David, a process that is irreversible. The twist comes when the real son, Martin, is brought back and the two children are set at odds with each other for the love of their mother. David's purpose is so simple that he has trouble understanding his place is this newly reformed family.After a series of misunderstood acts that look threatening, Monica must send David back to the manufacturers for destruction, but she cannot do it, leaving him in the woods to run away instead.
If this first hour or so of the film were the entire film, I think it might be the single best movie that Spielberg ever made.
The Second Act
That's not to imply that the second act is bad by any means, but where the first act feels so perfect in execution, the second feels inelegant, especially in comparison.
Back to supposition of the backend of production. Kubrick worked on and off of A.I. for almost 15 years. In that time he made two films (Full Metal Jacket and Eyes Wide Shut) while also trying to develop other films (The Aryan Papers in particular). It's obvious that he never fully fleshed out every point, and I think this major second section of the movie is the part the received the least amount of his attention. We know that the Flesh Fair, where robots are torn apart to the cheers of a human audience, was the brainchild of Spielberg, but Rouge City and Doctor Know were mostly Kubrick's (Robin Williams actually recorded his part at the direction of Kubrick before the director's death). This is the section where the two filmmakers seem to clash the most. This is the section that feels the most Spielbergian.
It's much more active than the first or third acts, with many more moving parts. It introduces Jude Law's character Gigolo Joe, contains a lot of travel and an embrace of special effects in some rather gaudy ways that the other two parts don't share. The act itself is good, but a solid step down from the first.
Where the inelegance really steps up, though, is in two major plot points. The first is around the introduction of Gigolo Joe. Joe is a robot lover/prostitute who services human women. He goes into a hotel to meet a client, finds her dead and her husband there, having done the murder. Joe knows that this means he's in trouble, but the explanation for that is absent. Does Joe believe that he'll be apprehended for her murder? It's unclear why anyone would think so, and that murkiness opens up the second act with a sense of confusion. The second plot point is how David and Joe end up escaping Rouge City. The police arrive to arrest Joe, but leave their amphibicopter unprotected to David can just get into it, play around with the controls a bit, and save Joe. It's not a plot hole, but a point of plot convenience that's extremely unsatisfying that also feels like something that an artist with more time to iron out details would have figured out better.
Still, the images are stark, especially the use of the Moon air balloon as the vehicle to steal rogue robots. I really like Joe as a character. The scene with Doctor Know is fun to watch. David's journey through different versions of love and hate, never finding any substitute for his core programming for his mother, is colorful and engaging.
The Third Act
From the moment we join Joe and David flying over the flooded Manhattan, we are firmly in Kubrick territory again. The movie quiets back down and focuses again sharply on David. They fly through the ruins of New York and find the hint they had gathered in Rouge City, the Lions who Weep, statues of lions with water streaming out of their mouths and eyes a hundred feet above the ocean.
It is in this building that the robotics firm has established a presence in wait for David's arrival, but there are surprises waiting for David, all that look exactly like him. David had been told by everyone around him that he was unique, one of a kind. But, according to Professor Hobby, David's creator, he's merely the first of a kind. Is David's love for his mommy unique anymore? He lashes out against the other active David, smashing his head in with a lamp. When Professor Hobby leaves to find others to talk with David, the robot, left with no meaning anymore, throws himself from the building into the water where he sees his next salvation. Joe saves David only to switch places with him in the amphibicoptor as Joe gets captured and David takes the craft into the ocean to face the Blue Fairy (more about her in a little bit) where he spends several thousand years begging her to become a real boy.
Before moving on to the coda, I just want to take a second to mention the marvelous imagery of this section. The lions weeping, the sight of New York, the line of robot boys, David peering through the face of another David to see where his first memory came from. It's all so striking and feels more like it came from the imagination of Kubrick than Spielberg. No offence to Mr. Spielberg, who is a very fine director, but Kubrick's use of imagery always feels more purposeful and thought out.The EndingAccording to Spielberg and Ian Watson (who wrote Kubrick's original treatment for the movie), this ending isn't a creation of Spielberg, but what Kubrick wanted. Kubrick wasn't known for rank sentimentality, so that reading of the ending, if you have it, might need to be revisited.
I recall talking with a teacher of mine after the movie had been out for some time who thought that the film overall was good, but the ending made it bad. I hung along with this opinion for a very long time, thinking that the ending was a mistake, until I watched the movie again recently. Instead of a schmaltzy coda that gave David everything he wanted, I saw a bitter, cynical ending about how David never got what he actually wanted. And that second reading of the film was much sadder to me.
In order to get to that reading though, we have to look at some of the mechanics of the ending.
David has run out of battery in the ensuing two thousand years when a race of advanced robots wakes him from his sleep. They read his mind and exclaim that this robot knew humans! The next thing we see is David waking up in the home he shared with Monica. Called out to by a voice, he finds the Blue Fairy who promises to give David a long life in this place, but David only wants Monica, his mommy. The Blue Fairy grants his wish and disappears.
Before David sees Monica, though, he's visited by one of the robots who explains to him that they can bring back Monica from the dead, but she will only last one day before she will expire never to return again. Does he really want this? Yes, he wants his mommy. The robots decide to give him what he wants. David proceeds to have the happiest day with his mommy, coloring, cooking, and just having a joyful time before Monica begins to grow tired. David puts her to sleep and falls asleep next to her with the narrator's voice heavily implying that David never woke up again.
On the surface, this seems like David got everything that he wanted, and he received a happy ending, an interpretation aided by the very lovely music John Williams scored for the scene, but I think a different interpretation is in order.
David never actually woke up from his sleep, and the robots put him into a computer simulation. They wanted to learn about either humans or their early ancestor robots and thought that they could learn from David, hoping to use him to understand a greater deal than they already knew. They offered him a long life to explore, and what did he ask for? His mommy. Knowing that they could get no more from him, they learned what they could from his single day fulfilling his purpose of loving and being loved, they shut him down. They put him down like a sick dog, because that's all he was good for.That's sad. Not happy.",A.I. Artificial Intelligence
70,Spleen,Spielberg's best film in twenty years,10,18 June 2002,"Firstly: it IS Spielberg's film.  That it's as good as it is may be because it began by being Kubrick's, but in the end Spielberg directed AND wrote the script: it's his effort and his credit.  Those viewers who reported a tug-of-war between Kubrick and Spielberg were imagining things.  (Perhaps they viewed the film under the influence of the popular, false view that Kubrick's films are always chilly and misanthropic while Spielberg's are always warm and generous.)  Of course, Kubrick would have done it all differently, and since he's the better director part of me wishes he HAD done it, but it's obvious enough that the film is a whole one, NOT at war with itself in any respect.The subject matter is a stretch for Spielberg, but then, that's nothing new: the same was true, at the time, of his three other greatest films: ""Jaws"", ""Raiders of the Lost Ark"" and ""Schindler's List"".  What's new this time is the sheer SCOPE of the story.  Few films cover this much ground (at least, few do so without losing their footing).  Another interesting novelty: for the first time in a Spielberg film, children (human children, that is) are accurately depicted as being monsters - and we're NOT invited to suppose that their nasty traits are somehow cute.  Quite apart from this, notice how completely the lingering sense of patriotism (on behalf of flesh-and-blood humanity) which almost always gets in the way when we try to properly appreciate a story of this kind, has been neutralised.  (Of all the films I've ever seen ""Bambi"" is the only other one that succeeds in neutralising this patriotism - and ""Bambi"" is far less ambitious.)You can't deny it's a lovely fable ... can you?  Well, some people do.  I don't understand why.  (If the consecutive endings bother you, bear in mind that consecutive endings constitute no defect when each ""ending"" is indeed a more fitting and beautiful conclusion, to EVERYTHING that has gone before, than the previous one was.)  But suppose, for the sake of argument, that the various parts of the film DON'T hold together (I know, I know).  Even so, the parts justify themselves.SPOILERS FOLLOW...Monica (the mother) is an intriguing character: at first, she's obsessed (pathologically so) with her comatose son, but when she comes to love David, and then has her son Martin returned to her, and then discovers that she can't have both Martin and David ... well, her decision to abandon David in the woods actually speaks well of her, given the options she had open to her.  I get the feeling she would have preferred to abandon Martin in the woods, but (for obvious reasons) couldn't do so.  Even among truly great directors, nine out of ten directors would have made the mother a locus of bestial irrationality; she is, instead, the most clear-eyed and reasonable person (organic OR mechanical) present.More well-judged details:  David is convincing as a robot designed to feel love, but not to act so as to inspire it.  I'll bet nobody guessed what a ""flesh fair"" would turn out to be.  The futuristic flying machine at the end is merely a cute and original design when we first see it and think it was built by aliens; when we find it's the work of future, hyper-advanced robots, it turns out to be exactly the kind of thing they WOULD think of - a virtual aircraft, as it were.  Williams's score is one of his very his best (considered as a score).  The spinach scene is suitably creepy.  The ""moonrise"" is surely one of the most stunning visual ideas in cinema history.  All in all, the art direction is amazing.  Everyone who went to see the latest Star Wars because they wanted to drink in jaw-dropping futuristic visions should have seen this instead - on a visual basis alone, they would have got twelve times more bang for their buck.The only real flaw (apart from a technical detail which irks me but which isn't really worth mentioning here - you can find it in the goofs section on this site) is the title.  I like to think ""A.I."" was a dummy title which Spielberg didn't have the heart to throw away off after Kubrick's death. It's not an attractive title (""Supertoys Last All Summer Long"" doesn't thrill me either, but it's better), nor is it apt.  The film isn't about artificial intelligence at all.",A.I.

71,raulfaust,One of a kind,8,13 September 2011,"A young mechanical boy (David) is ""bought"" to an American family to replace their son who is about to die. Unexpectedly, their real son is healed from his problem and the family ends up having two young boys. Funny if not sorrowful, the real son is a smart one who is willing to do anything to put the blame on the mechanical one, so the parents are induced to abandon him in order to not give him back to the company, otherwise he would be destroyed. The abandonment is very sad and difficult to watch, the boy pleases all he can to not be left there, but the mother is tough on her decision. David then travels all around the country to find a way to be loved from his mother once again, believing that he would find the Pinnochio's Blue Fairy and then become a totally human boy. Sadly, he doesn't achieve this purpose and is left in the water for two thousand years. Remarkably made, ""Artificial Intelligence"" is a sci-fi/drama classic to be seen by all ages and groups. There's no single person on this Earth that won't be excited in this film. The 146 minutes go by so quickly and we pray for it to never end.

72,PredragReviews,Do We Really Want To Embrace the Future?,9,26 January 2017,"""A.I.: Artificial Intelligence"" has a fascinating premise and story. Kubrick turned the project over to Steven Spielberg when he realized it ""fit"" Spielberg's style of direction more than his own. Spielberg takes ""A.I."" and turns it into a live action modern retelling of ""Pinocchio"" along with elements of Harlan Ellison's short story ""Jeffity is Five"" about an ageless little boy who, real or not, wants nothing more than to be loved for what he is. ""A.I."" focuses on Monica and Henry Swinton (Francis O'Connor and Sam Robards)a couple who have a son in cryostatus because of an incurable disease. David (Haley Joel Osmond)a bio-mechanical humanoid with emotions is given to them by Doctor Hobby (William Hurt) to be a substitute for their son. When their real son returns home after a cure is found, David finds himself pushed out by a mother that cares for him enough not to want to have his memory destroyed but not enough to keep him. This sets him on an odyssey to find some way to become real and he meets Gigolo Joe (Jude Law) a pleasure ""mecha"" searching for meaning with his own kind. The plot, true, is a variation of Pinnochio, but still, the upshot of the story is no so much that David wants to be a real boy so much as it is that he wants to be loved. He loves, and doesn't understand why that love is not returned. He thinks that by becoming a real boy, this will happen. ""Artificial Intelligence"" strives to answer age old questions: What responsibilities do we have to our makers? Is love an unconditional force? How can we distinguish between real and artificial love? Are humans the only ones capable of genuine love? Can a robot love more than a human being? And if so, would that still be considered love? Although ""A.I."" is certainly flawed the film offers much food for thought in a modern retelling of ""Pinocchio"" by writer-director Steven Spielberg and producers Stanley Kubirck & Jan Harlan. Osmond's David comes across as an occasionally needy and whining character which does hamper the film some what. There are elements of both directors in this film and while they sometimes sit awkwardly next to each other the over all impact and emotional power of the film works well. The music, the direction, the way the film falls neatly into five main parts, the lighting, the acting by Haley Joel Osmont, Jude Law and all the cast is pitch perfect. The ending is so emotional, I defy you to not shed a tear!Overall rating: 9 out of 10.",A.I. Artificial Intelligence
73,philip_vanderveken,"It isn't that bad, it's just that you know that it could have been so much better.",6,11 January 2005,"I was sure that this would be a great movie. I'm convinced that Spielberg is one of the best of today's directors so a project like this should certainly turn into gold in his hands. But apparently I was wrong. It's not the way everything is shown. From the beginning until the end it all looks very good, even breath taking from time to time. The surroundings (especially at the end of the movie), the gadgets, the robots,... it all has been done in a way that can't be disapproved. But I need more in a movie than just some good special effects and cool gadgets. I want a breath taking story, I want to see real emotions and feelings,... and that's where this movie went wrong. It all looked fine, but when you try to dig a bit deeper, you'll notice that this is actually a 'sterile' movie. It never felt real to me.If you ask me to describe the movie than I would say that this is a mixture of fairy tales like Pinokkio (it literally refers to it several times during the movie), The Terminator (it's futuristic, has robots in it and shows how people react to those robots) and Tron (because of some costumes). The story is about a robot-boy that has been created to act and feel like a human. First his 'parents' love him, but than their real son awakes from a coma and they no longer want him. The robot-boy is convinced that he has to become a real human and that then his mommy will love him again. Because he has heard the story of Pinnochio, he goes after 'The Blue Fairy' who will transform him and make a human boy out of him, just like in the fairy tale.Overall this isn't such a bad movie, it's a bit slow from time to time and it never really seems real, but the special effects make sure this is still a movie that will be remembered. The only problem with it is that you know that it could have been so much better. That's why I give it a 6/10.",A.I. Artificial Intelligence

A short story that became a 2 hour + plus torture device.It is a slow moving mess. When you think it is over its not. This has 3 endings! The movie goes on and on! I can not see why anyone would LOVE THIS. It is very BORING!. There is millions of Stanley Kubrick fans that will rate this a 10 only because it is a movie that ""Stanley Kubrick"" had a hand in developing. However these are the same people that would give ""John Tucker Must Die"" a 10 if Stanley Kubrick had directed that!This 2001 American science fiction drama film directed by Steven Spielberg. The screenplay by Spielberg was based on a screen story by Ian Watson and the 1969 short story ""Super-Toys Last All Summer Long"" by Brian Aldiss. The film was produced by Kathleen Kennedy, Spielberg and Bonnie Curtis. It stars Haley Joel Osment, Jude Law, Frances O'Connor, Brendan Gleeson and William Hurt. Set in a futuristic post-climate change society, A.I. tells the story of David (Osment), a childlike android uniquely programmed with the ability to love.Development of A.I. originally began with producer-director Stanley Kubrick, after he acquired the rights to Aldiss' story in the early 1970s. Kubrick hired a series of writers until the mid-1990s, including Brian Aldiss, Bob Shaw, Ian Watson, and Sara Maitland. The film languished in protracted development for years, partly because Kubrick felt computer-generated imagery was not advanced enough to create the David character, whom he believed no child actor would convincingly portray. In 1995, Kubrick handed A.I. to Spielberg, but the film did not gain momentum until Kubrick's death in 1999. Spielberg remained close to Watson's film treatment for the screenplay. However the lack of a central focus makes this film languish.When I saw this I could not believe how boring it was! The movie had a promising start! What really doesn't work is that 1/2 way through the movie just becomes a chase movie and its not a very exciting chase!All these years later you don't hear anyone saying ""This film is a misunderstood gem'.

75,screenman,Child Safety Alert,3,25 August 2008,"'Artificial Intelligence' is, without any doubt, one of the creepiest movies I have ever seen. Watching it I was reminded of Micheal Jackson's insistence that sleeping naked with other people's children was perfectly normal, or Paed. Townsend of rock band 'The Who' claiming that his paid visits to child-pornography web-sites were all in the name of innocent research for a book. A book, by the way, that never seems to have been written.Over the years I have developed a concern about Steven Spielberg. His pre-occupation with little children - especially 'pretty' boys - has left me with a very uneasy feeling.His great career debut was a movie called, simply 'Duel'. And it was an absolutely scorching thriller. Yet since that time we have seen him concentrate more and more on 'family' movies, with an emphasis that seems to be overly weighted upon childhood. It may be that I do the man a great dis-service, just as I do Messers Jackson and Townsend. Still; the nagging doubt remains.'Artificial Intelligence' dwells upon a little 'boy' robot who seems to be obsessed with a search for his 'mommy'. We follow this tiresome electronic dope through a series of adventures and mishaps in a movie that seems to last all weekend. Time and again we are plunged into some intimate, atmospheric emotional close-up in which the camera lingers like a voyeur. It may be that this boy really is an excellent child-star, but I don't think we need to study the minutiae of his facial expression and body-language quite so often, quite so long and in quite so much detail. He's a confused little android - okay; I get the message. I got it in the first 15 minutes or so.But no; it doesn't end there. Spielberg luxuriates in this maudlin expression of vulnerable infancy time after time, milking the moment for every drop of sentimental slush, whilst a nauseatingly romantic incidental music (as usual) hammers the theme home with all the subtlety of an orchestral train-wreck. The scene in which those preposterously fairy-kind aliens thaw him out and re-unite him with his 'mommy-for-a-day' is without doubt the most powerful emetic I have ever sampled and should not be attempted by anyone with an adverse gastric condition.Coming after 'Empire Of The Sun', 'Close Encounters', 'ET', and 'Jurassic Park' (each with pretty little boys) it's all a creepy bit too much. Then, of course, there was 'War Of The Worlds'; and despite there being no children prominent in Wells's book, or indeed the superior 1960's movie, nice Uncle Stevie couldn't resist his hankering for innocent young flesh - a little girl this time. Even in the seminal thriller 'Jaws' the police chief (Roy Scheider) had a nice plump little boy, though he was himself clearly old enough to be - well, Uncle Stevie. With each outing it gets longer, more intimate, and more schmaltzy.I think it's high time Mr Spielberg began concentrating on 'adult' movies for a while like 'Saving Private Ryan'. Not just as a change, but as a change of direction, and Leave Those Kids Alone.Frankly, I shudder to think what his next effort will be like. Just don't be surprised to find Whacko Jacko given a starring role.Anyone fancy 'Nice Uncle Stevie' for a babysitter? Perhaps Gary Glitter then? Don't you wanna be in their gang, their gang?",A.I.

David is living happily with Monica and her husband, but when their real son returns home after a cure is discovered, his life changes dramatically. A futuristic adaptation of the tale of Pinocchio, with David being the ""fake"" boy who desperately wants to become ""real"".This has a good story but the execution of it was more of a mess than anything really brilliant in most Steven Spielberg's films. The first act acts like a non-affectionate tale of a boy who wants a mother. Where's the cuteness? Where's the movie that makes you go ""awe""?The second act is a bit darker and gives you more exuberant special effects, like a fairy tale. There is one sequence in particular (Rouge city) that makes your jaw drop. It's filled with great colors for your eyes to feast on. This act also gives you a faster pace, being more of an adventure tale. Well, I really think that they could've added a little more ooomph to it. Make it a bigger adventure.Then the last act acts more ludicrous in which it could be good and bad at the same time. That's because you would never think such a thing would ever happen yet it's more affectionate than the first act and has an anti-climax ending.I liked the weird score and awesome special effects in the film. I also liked the creepy role by Haley Joel Osment, sweet role by Frances O'Connor, and weird role by Jude Law. I also like to say this has an original feel to it.I would've wanted this film to be a lot better. I was quite disappointed, though.

78,bandw,I think Kubrick would have been appalled.,6,18 May 2013,"To criticize this story for is unbelievability is rather hopeless (may favorite nonsense was the rain that was falling while the action was supposedly underwater). So, I think you have to take this mainly as a fanciful entertainment. But that is sad, since there was an opportunity for this story to have had some substance.The movie starts out posing some interesting questions about human/machine interactions. Humans have a heightened ability to bond with inanimate objects and fictional characters. Indeed, I think it is that ability that we are being called on to exercise when watching this movie. But for me this works only when I can identify with a character. This movie very much wants us to identify with the cute robot boy, but that I could not do. I get irritated enough when my GPS man or my computer talks to me, so I doubt that I would respond a whole lot differently to a robot. But the movie does make a good case for how the so-called parents become attached to their robotic boy who was programmed to give and receive love. That *would* make things more difficult. But when the kid starts to behave in unexpected and unwelcome ways and the mother makes an agonizing decision to part with him, that is where the movie went astray for me. From there it was mostly an orgy of CGI effects. Not to say that these were not entertaining, but most all intellectual content was lost, even though there were some interesting observations on an ultimate conflict between humans and the machines they had created. The topic of how humans would react to sophisticated robots is deserving of treatment more substantial that what is presented here.It would be interesting to see what Kubrick would have done with this, since his visual style was more refined and less in-your-face than Spielberg's, whose primary goal seems to be to impress. Kubrick had a more significant way of tapping into my deeper emotions than Spielberg's forced sentimentality. And the John Williams score that tries to tell us how to feel at all times is an embarrassment.This is entertaining enough, but misses an opportunity to explore the subject at any depth.

This movie is divided in two very distinct parts: the first one an ordinary sci-fi movie using all the computer special effects we are already used to and sometimes almost fed up with and the second, which raises the value of the movie, where the director's philosophical and metaphysical worries are put in. The story itself has got a lot of loose ends resulting of too many good intentions which don't end up in logical conclusions. There is one thing however that Spielberg seems to have forgotten: man will probably be able to produce artificial intelligence; what he cannot produce and most probably never will, are artificial feelings like love, friendship or hate.

81,DeeNine-2,Best Sci Fi since Blade Runner?,8,5 December 2003,"(Note: Over 500 of my movie reviews are now available in my book ""Cut to the Chaise Lounge or I Can't Believe I Swallowed the Remote!"" Get it at Amazon.)I understand that Steven Spielberg took over this project started by the late Stanley Kubrick, which would explain the uneasy edge to the usual Spielbergian treatment. The remnants of Kubrick's message, namely that humans are soon-to-be obsolete beasts, contend with the usual Spielberg formula of corn syrup, tears, and awe, so that the result is unsettling and more than a bit curiouser and curiouser.First of all, be aware that, despite the fact that there is a full serving of the Spielberg recipe here (cute kids, dazzling special effects, a beautiful score by John Williams, social consciousness seen largely from a kid's POV, etc.), this is not a ""feel good"" movie that will appeal to the mass audience at which Spielberg usually aims. The heartland of America will find this film disturbing and will tell their neighbors to stay away. Sci fi afficionados of the hard science variety (like myself) will have mixed feelings since some of the science is, shall we say, unlikely. The fantasy/sorcery crowd will probably be disenchanted for other reasons, although there is a glorious ending that might mist up one's eyes (it did mine). Overall, however, this is an unsettling look at humanity and where we're headin' (""Is that Lincoln County Road or Armageddon?""), and the treatment is definitely NOT something for the kiddies. It's liable to give them nightmares.The central hook of the film is that we are made to identify with the robotic mechas, especially Haley Joel Osment's David and Jack Angel's Teddy and Jude Law's Gigolo Joe, while being reminded that they are not human, or more properly, that they are more admirable than human. In a way the robots resemble the have-nots of the current society, the handicapped and the poor, while the humans in the persons of Monica Swinton (Frances O'Connor), her son Martin (Jake Thomas) and the Flesh Fair entrepreneur (Brendan Gleeson) represent respectively the privileged, the cruel, and the exploitive. Monica's compromised morality is made clear in the scene in the woods (which I won't describe for fear of giving away too much). One also gets the sense that she and her husband (who portray the usual kid-show parental mentality) are not actually bright enough to figure out what has happened when siblings and friends have conflicts. Monica simply sides with her biological child and throws David to the wolves, as it were.On another level this is a movie about a child's undying love for his mother, a love that lasts for two thousand years and a day and is never compromised. It is about believing in fairy tales and the miraculous, a modern day Pinocchio in Wonderland as might be dreamed up by admirers of Blade Runner (1982). In the Spielberg canon, echoes from his cinematic predecessors mesh with echoes from his own movies in a sometimes all too obvious way. Note the return of the moon (in sinister splendor) from E.T. with Teddy (who could have been retrieved from the set of Blade Runner--as could Prof. Hobby, AKA Geppetto) trudging across the top of a rise in front of it.The sets and the animations are sumptuous and beautiful. The robots and the aliens are ingeniously crafted. I very much liked the vision of a drowned Manhattan with the upper stories of the skyscrapers rising above the level of the sea (presumably from global warming), giving us a very quiet and almost contemplative Manhattan, and then the skyscrapers immersed in ice as the earth falls into a prolonged ice age. The sense of the rapid passage of awesome time reminded me a bit of Kubrick's 2001: A Space Odyssey (1968), while Dr. Know (voice of Robin Williams) recalled The Wizard of Oz (1939), and the Blue Fairy (voice of Meryl Streep) something from Disney.This is a substantially compromised masterpiece, as it certainly had to be coming from the ghost of Kubrick as fashioned by Hollywood's most powerful and most commercially successful director, but an engaging, ambitious spiral into the future, one well worth watching one, one that will linger in the mind awhile.See this to encourage Spielberg to emphasize creativity over formula, to encourage him to make more movies that dare to offend the mass mind while intriguing the rest of us.",A.I.

82,punishmentpark,Roboy.,6,8 December 2013,"I liked this one quite a bit before, but this (third or fourth) time around it kind of fell apart, and not just because it has so many different chapters; a philosophical opening, a sci-fi / satirical drama second act, then a quick futuristic city thriller-bit to introduce a new character (Law's), moving onto an arena action-adventure and eventually descending further down the Pinocchio-pathway which, with not too much fantasy, leads to the origins of Christianity (or religion in general) - and then some. There is a clear story running throughout, sure, but...Particular low points are some settings (the arena and it's boring action), the Dr. Know-business (hello Einstein) being the worst of that (though it must be said that some settings and graphics were really wonderful, like the house, Manhattan and the 'futuristic ones'), and the overall simplistic approach of intricate philosophical material; there's plenty there, but in the end it is a rather sentimental sci-fi adventure movie with some good parts of (intense) drama.The (sci-fi) drama-part that starts playing out well into the second act in the futuristic house, with mostly David and Monica interacting, and later on Martin 'interfering', I found to be most interesting and gripping, even though several questions pop when things get out of hand; for instance, I know David has to be a bóy, but why not program him to be more sensible about the childish provocations of Martin? That could have easily been done without him losing his spontaneous, child-like qualities. And if not, don't put the boy on the market...Well, that's (some of) my thoughts in a nutshell. It's certainly a doable and endearingly adventurous (fairy tale) film, and Osment brings a vivid David to life, but this time I at times really started wondering how Kubrick would have brought all this to the screen...

83,bobsgrock,"Complex, and not in a good way",6,28 May 2008,"Steven Spielberg's AI is a well-made, visually stunning film that pays homage to the late, great director Stanley Kubrick, but leaves most of the audience scratching their heads. Spielberg directs and writes this story that Kubrick tried to make for years but died just as he was going to start it. It's not that I don't think Spielberg could handle it; I just think Kubrick is the better director and could do it better. His amazing attention to little details and situations make nearly all of his films classics and this one might have been no different. Lamenting aside, this is still a pretty decent film with incredible visual effects. There is no arguing Spielberg is a great visual director and he certainly handles the material here very well. Every scene is filled with awe and wonder as we are overwhelmed with stunning pictures and images. The biggest problem here is the script which runs along fine for about ninety minutes, then turns into a very different kind of a film. What starts out as a heartwarming journey about a young robot trying to become a boy turns into a horror story of bizarre experiences. In my opinion, Spielberg got bogged down in the sentimental material an d didn't focus on the dehumanization of a futuristic society; something Kubrick certainly would have done. There is a point where it should have ended to save face and it could have been one of Spielberg's best. Nevertheless, he presses on and goes for the tearjerker, which doesn't work and only makes us scratch our heads. In the end, here is a story which we simply cannot connect with the main characters since they are all artificial robots. Of course it was a risk to do this, and at times it does succeed, but more often it does not.",A.I. Artificial Intelligence
84,lambiepie-2,"A Wonderful film that gets sidetracked, but amazingly so! (Spoilers included)",8,18 September 2002,"I just watched A.I. and I feel this is a wonderful film that has several other films in it that may bog it down and turn alot of people off.The first hour reminded me of a Stanley Krubeck film similar to 2001. As Robot David got caught and sent to the Flesh Fair and the speech of the Flesh Fair owner, to me this WAS the ending of the film. Not an anti-climax mind you, but the true end of the film A.I.Then...there is the robot ""Gigolo Joe"" and his world. That was a whole adult concept within itself (especially with the City which is visually stunning!) that wanted to go somewhere but kept chickening out into PG-13 land. All I kept thinking about when I watched Joe was ""Gosh....I wish Director Ken Russell would have done this."" Then...there was the ""Pinocchio"" factor. There were threads of it throughout the film, but surrounding the story with it was overkill to me. They could have just left that in the development room. I found it overbearing.Then...there was the establishment where Robot David was made. I love William Hurt and I felt there was a separate story somewhere that included his character, the makings of David, other robots, the subsequent mass marketing of David, etc., that got downplayed and sidetracked. The New York City situation was also confusing to a point but I think the connection IS with the William Hurt character, why he really developed David as opposed to the obvious explanation, why he was so driven to develop David, etc., etc.Then...there was the ""Close Encounters from the Third Kind - esqe"" thing. It ""kinda"" worked for me, but again, I felt that something was missing and something didn't quite work. What is that Pinocchio thing?  It might have worked if the film went one way, then again, maybe not. The very, very last 5 minutes of the film, upon looking at it a third time, did finally make me cry. But I had to find that within myself and ignore everything else to get to that state, to understand.I am not saying this isn't an entertaining film, it is. I am not saying this will not grow on you, for it will. And I am not saying that the Special Effects were awful for if you view this film for anything, the special effects are FANTASTIC!!! But that was alot of effort into a story that just didn't quite leave you feeling complete.I did enjoy the story of the A.I. love robot David wanted and had. One could easily substitute the Robot David for -- any adoptive child, or any pet. I really enjoyed ""Teddy"" very much and was totally transfixed on him and how Robot David made a clear A.I. division between he and Teddy when there really wasn't one at all.The part of the film I loved the MOST was ""Dr. Know"". If you see the film for nothing else, this part is truly a gem, excellent work.So if you're looking to be ""wow-ed"", and visually stunned, this is the film. If you're looking for a deep story, this film has several deep stories, they just don't quite lead to one good story.",A.I. Artificial Intelligence
85,kevin c,DON'T BELIEVE THE HYPE,4,14 November 2003,"This film was routed by the critics.

86,mattymatt4ever,A truly fascinating and genuinely imaginative piece of work!,9,1 July 2001,"I wasn't exactly part of the crowd who was deeply anticipating this big summer movie.  Meaning, I wasn't cruising all the ""A.I."" websites, scraping up as much info as possible.  I tried to keep my mind fresh.  The previews don't give a hell of a lot away.  Which is a good thing.  I had a very vague idea of what this movie would be about when entering the theater.  And I think that's how Kubrick wanted it to be.  Before releasing the much-anticipated ""Eyes Wide Shut"" Kubrick simply showed teaser trailers, setting a montage of images from the film to Chris Isaak's ""Baby Did a Bad Thing"" (or something like that).  So I think Spielberg was simply carrying on Kubrick's legacy by keeping ""A.I."" in seclusion.I'm a big Kubrick fan myself, and yes Kubrick would've done a better job at directing this fascinating sci-fi epic.  But this is KUBRICK we're talking about!  He was able to make anything into a masterpiece!  Even Spielberg (who is an excellent, prestigious director with worldwide fame) pales in comparison.  Of course, Kubrick would've given ""A.I."" a darker edge and a more subtle tone.  There are, undoubtedly, some dark moments in this film, so parents shouldn't expect their children to have a jolly time.  You're better off taking your young ones to see ""Shrek.""  But Kubrick would've darkened the atmosphere even more.  As I read from another user, Kubrick was originally going to have the mother (the beautiful Frances O'Connor) be an alcoholic.All in all, I was deeply engaged during many points in the film.  This is just a fascinating, original work and it took a great imagination to conjure up these ideas.  I don't know where people get off comparing ""A.I."" to ""E.T.""--besides the fact that the two titles sound alike and it gives them potential to insert a smart-a** remark.  For example, I read one review with the headline:  ""E.T. it A.I.n't.""  I think the two movies completely stand for themselves.  If anything, you can compare this to the tale of ""Pinnochio""--which the film makes references to here and there.  David (Haley Joel Osment), the Mecca (robot) with a heart, wants to become a ""real boy,"" just like ""Pinnochio.""  He believes that he'll find a blue fairy that'll transform him into a real-live human being and ""his mother will love him.""  And I love how the scene where David lops off a piece of his Mom's hair actually had significance later in the film.  A quite noble significance, too.  When his mother leaves David stranded in the woods with his robotic bear/companion Teddy (who sometimes steals the show and is so cute!), he meets his fellow Meccas scrambling for spare parts and the villain (great Irish actor Brendan Gleeson) captures these Meccas, so he can destroy them in front of millions of human beings (who are angry because the Meccas are outnumbering their kind) for entertainment by shooting them out of cannons and using other brutal methods that will keep the crowd cheering. David later on meets Gigolo Joe (Jude Law) who is (you've guessed it) a gigolo.  He's also a Mecca and tries to help David on his journey to find the ""blue fairy"" that will make him become real.The set designs and art direction are superb and keep you in awe. Spielberg did a terrific job at creating this surreal, futuristic world.  Forget the boring visuals in ""Pearl Harbor""!  You want to see some good visuals? Plese check out ""A.I.""  I guarantee it's like nothing you've ever seen! Absolutely unbelievable!The performances are good all-around.  Haley Joel Osment turns in yet another fine performance that might yell ""Oscar!""  First ""The Sixth Sense,"" then ""Pay it Forward"" and now this!  Haley, you're going places!  Jude Law is quite entertaining in a quirky and funny performance.
The movie runs approximately two hours and thirty minutes, and it does get slow at points (could've used a little more editing), but I was completely fascinated and stunned by this mind-blowing, thought-provoking sci-fi fantasy!  Spielberg's done it again!  I'm sure Kubrick would've had a list of notes (if he can communicate with Spielberg in spirit) to give the director, being the huge perfectionist he is, but after seeing the final product I'm sure Kubrick would've been pleased.  This is a truly remarkable motion picture!  A must-see!My score:  9 (out of 10)",A.I. Artificial Intelligence
87,vip_ebriega,Kubrick and Spielberg's 'A.I.' is a machine with heart.,10,26 August 2008,"My Take: Uses special effects in service of its wonderful story. An intriguing and sometimes poetic excursion. After Stanley Kubrick's death, it was inevitable that A.I.: ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE, his long-planned project with Steven Spielberg, will not be made the same way it might have been. But that's alright, as Spielberg follows Kubrick's footsteps very closely, as if the man as still there behind the stage. At times, Spielberg actually gives us the feeling of being in one of Kubrick's own films. Sure, the film still makes room for some lukewarm Spielberg sap, but other than that, this is Spielberg's deepest, darkest film to date, one that ventures deeper in the world he only explored (and succeeded) on E.T. THE EXTRA-TERRESTRIAL.Although the relationship between A.I and E.T. are comparable, the two films are actually very much unlike each other. Once again, Spielberg ventures into our most cherished imaginings and turns them into mind-tricking reality. The special effects here are wonderful of course (what isn't if you work with the guys at ILM), but more wonderful is how imaginative and innovative they are. This is the Spielberg charm, a special effects machine with heart. A movie that makes us wonder, delight, question, captivate and focus on while not denying us the pleasures of the latest in special effects technology. Instead of a the typical flash-and-bang products, Spielberg honors Kubrick by giving us sights for which we can ponder and absorb all its wonders; pretty much what Kubrick's Monoliths did for 2001. The special effect here are stunning (remember seeing REAL dinosaurs in JURASSIC PARK for the first time?), but Spielberg doesn't waste the wonder by providing a cohesive story and an imaginative direction to go along with his visual eye candy. But this isn't just some story about a boy robot, or his adventures in trying to please his foster human parents. The story is based on a work by Brian Aldiss called ""Summer Toys Last all Summer Long"", a project toyed with by Stanley Kubrick for many years. Through these many years, Spielberg gives a welcome helping hand during development. Up until Kubrick's untimely death, the film was developed nearly enough, but it still wasn't a film. Spielberg doesn't deny us the work they've done so far. He provides us a story that captivates even as a far-from-perfection film. A.I. is not without its flaws of course. The pacing takes nearly forever to get going, and some of the pure Spielberg sappiness is undeniably present. But in the end, it is Spielberg himself who makes A.I. a terrific motion picture of the sci-fi mold. The film takes place somewhere in a not-so-distant (by today's standards) future, where Global Warming has flooded many of the world's major cities. In place of a lessening population, scientists resolves to Mechas, near-human machines that'll make cyborgs look like the Tin Man. Haley Joel Osment, after his sweeping performance in THE SIXTH SENSE already made him a star, plays a new model Mecha designed by the successful CEO/visionary (William Hurt) who is programmed to do what machines can't do: Fall in love with a parent, and in turn be loved back.Frances O'Conner and Sam Robards play the foster parents of David, substituting him temporarily for their son (Jake Thomas), under a coma, who pretty soon snaps out of his coma and has a little brotherly competition with his would-be Mecha brother. When life gets too tough, he is soon asked to be destroyed. Feeling sympathy for the little boy (robot), his (foster) mother instead sets him out to the open world, alongside him only his walking, talking teddy bear and high hopes that he meets with the Blue Fairy, the fairy from his Pinocchio stories which he believes will grant him the wish of becoming a real boy so that his mother will love him more. Jude law co-stars as a playboy gigolo Mecha named Gigolo Joe who aids David's side (mainly because he has digs on this ""Blue Fairy""). By the time the film reaches its second act, the audience would have been divided between those who would stick to it or walk out. Although A.I. is wonderful piece of work; an artful ode to the ponderous storytelling talents of Stanley Kubrick done best since Kubrick himself DID partly make this film, it ain't a film for everyone. It's wondrous, intriguing, admittedly flawed, but vast and gripping. Anyone expecting a film that takes its premise easily may find the film a bit to dark and sober. But this is just what Kubrick wants it to be, and being like a student of a master that he still is, Spielberg couldn't agree more. A.I. may have been a film that could be passed on from one great director to another, but there could be no other way to tell it. What a wonderful and underrated film! Rating: ***** out of 5.",A.I.

89,gbheron,It Deserved It's Disappointing Box Office,5,24 January 2004,"Many reviewers and critics have bemoaned the fact that this film did not achieve the box-office success it deserved. I am more in agreement with the theater-going public; this misfire deserved its disappointing take. Not that it didn't try, and in my opinion, should have succeeded.
Two of the greatest directors in the history of film were associated with the project, and apparently cared deeply about it. They are, of course, Stanley Kubrick and Steven Spielberg. It was Spielberg that finally directed A.I. and perhaps it was his desire to adhere to Kubrick's vision (or his perception of it) that threw the film off balance. That, or perhaps Spielberg is getting sappy. Nonetheless, the movie tries to cover too much philosophical ground, and instead of telling a good story, we're stuck with an odd polemic on the nature of love, life, and lots of other deep subjects. There was a great, dark, story to tell and a fine cast assembled to assist in the telling.  But Spielberg decided to get preachy, ditched the inherit drama (and horror) of the story, and subjected the paying public to a sermon. I don't find that so entertaining, and apparently neither did many others.",A.I. Artificial Intelligence
90,KnightsofNi11,Beautiful sci-fi with great emotion,8,12 August 2012,"Twelve years before his death the legendary Stanley Kubrick worked on conceptualizing a science fiction epic called A.I. Along the way he collaborated heavily with Steven Spielberg, eventually allowing him to direct it. Kubrick passed in 1999 and Spielberg finished the film for release in 2001. In many ways, A.I. Artificial Intelligence is the final film from Stanley Kubrick. For this reason alone it is a must see.In the film, Haley Joel Osment stars as David, an android who has been built to love. But, when granting a robot these kinds of human emotions you run into a lot of speed bumps on the way. These speed bumps are things that David encounters and must overcome as he journeys to find the Blue Fairy who will make him a real boy so that his adopted mother, Monica, will love him the way he wants to be loved. A.I. throws us into a world where artificially intelligent robots run rampant to the point where they are just a regular thing in society. However, David is one of a kind, and so is his story.This film makes its intentions quite clear throughout. It wants to be an incredibly emotional and incredibly heartfelt science fiction film, more so than any film we've seen before. I would say that, for the most part, it absolutely succeeds. It's an exquisitely moving film that is fueled by a sci-fi backdrop. David's quest for self discovery and his longing to be real is an enthralling and captivating story. David is as real as any human being in emotion, which makes it all the more difficult to see him as an android whose emotional connection is all artificial. It's the challenge that the film puts forth and the moral ground that it covers. It makes you look to the future and consider if artificial intelligence is really something that could pay off in this magnitude, or is it really this necessary? Not only does A.I. provide a heart wrenching story, but it is set against a magnificent and wondrous science fiction world full of landscapes, cities, buildings, and vehicles that all look astounding. This is a conceptually brilliant film that never falters as a visual spectacle. It's certainly on a grand scale, one more grandiose than the story at hand, but it doesn't hurt the film. The only things that really keep A.I. from being a masterpiece are small issues with dialogue and performances, and the fact that it's emotion can be somewhat heavy handed and force fed at times, teetering on melodrama rather than sincerity. These things don't keep this film from being great, though, because it is still highly original and a marvelous spectacle to watch.",A.I. Artificial Intelligence
91,jon.h.ochiai,Finding A Heart,9,1 July 2001,"Steven Spielberg's ""A.I."" is ambitious work that honors the vision of Stanley Kubrick which Spielberg ultimately makes his own-- a good thing. Spielberg's A.I. is a fable that takes on the nature of being human, and the nature of love. A.I. opens with Prof. Hobby (William Hurt) proposing the design of an android child that can be programmed to love it's human parents, and this love would be unconditional. A colleague poses the next logical question: Can a human love an android back? David (Haley Joel Osment)--the child android-- is placed under the care of Henry and Monica Swinton (Sam Robards and Frances O'Connor). The Swintons have an ailing young son, Martin, in cryogenic freeze. Monica has reservations about this undertaking. She develops a relationship with David. Along the way (for the one mechanical part of the story) Martin makes a recovery and returns to the Swintons'. Martin becomes jealous of David and plots his downfall. David falls out of grace due to circumstance. David must now find his place in the world. Though in his departure, Monica displays a true act of love for her ""son"" which goes undistinguished by David. The Spielberg screenplay from the Ian Watson screen story is coherent, though not always cohesive. There is a gaudy monster truck-like spectacle involving ""mecha's"" (androids) being demolished that is unnecessary, and making Martin the ""evil"" real son is manipulative. The movie could have been shorter. Like Pinochio (alluded to in the story), David believes that he can only be loved if he becomes a ""real"" boy. In his literal quest to find Pinochio's Blue Fairy, he is accompanied by Joe (Jude Law), a android prostitute. Spielberg keeps us guessing how this will all end to-- the very end. It is the search for the Holy Grail, the nature of love, that distinguishes ""A.I."" Perhaps one definition of love is that love is accepting someone for who they are, and for what they are NOT. What happens when that someone is a machine-- not human? ""A.I."" asks the worthwhile questions. Along those lines Haley Joel Osment gives an amazing performance. His David is ""almost"" human, and his quest in life is to be loved-- the most human of all. Osment showcases this kind of authenticity and compassion in a difficult role. The supporting cast, particularly Frances O'Connor are effective. Ultimately, Osment's David and his journey to find his place in the world keeps us inside the movie. Because we all have have thought about our place in the world, and the human legacies we will leave behind...",A.I. Artificial Intelligence

93,stamper,"The concept interested me, the tagline moved me, the film did only a BIT of both",6,5 November 2001,"When I first heard Steven Spielberg was to finish this idea of Kubrick I was kind of elevated. I mean I heard what the concept was about and I had faith in it that Spielberg could make a good film out of this without losing track of Kubrick's vision. I, myself envisioned it to be some kind of Blade Runneresque Philip K.Dick story and partly I was not mistaken, because when Jude Law first appears on the screen we are indeed presented with a Blade Runner like future.
The story told here, is not a bad one and I must say there are a lot of things here that are good to great but there is a factor that disturbs it all, something that makes even the greatest achievements of this film go away. It is simply Spielberg's approach. I mean as strange as Kubrick's visions are, they formed the good part of this film. There was a message hidden there. Something to be read between the lines. Something that we must remember as we make progress in science. Too bad it was something that did not hold on. I mean I do not really know when the Kubrick part ended and Spielberg's hand came in to play, but I think any movie buff's guess is as good as mine. And my guess is, the end of Kubrick's part is when the ice comes. It just has all of the characteristics I would ascribe to a Kubrick film, whereas the rest has something in it a Kubrick film never had, elements of a fairy tale. I must say that this was the worst ending I have ever seen in a Spielberg movie. I cannot believe he actually did that. I was sitting in the theater awaiting ending credits and all of a sudden the story went on in a stupid manner. I remember thinking: What the (bad f word) is Spielberg doing???' I did get no answer, but I soon realized it was nothing good he was doing. He should have spared us that. I hope this only is a slip by Spielberg and his next film will be better again. Please let this film be the worst Spielbergian cinema offering for the two - thousands as The Lost World was for the nineteen  nineties.
Having bashed on this film for some time now I'd like to say some stuff about the good things. Good effects, music, cinematography, directing (basically technical stuff), but expect all the good technical stuff there is only one real (non  technical) thing in this film that is worth while. You probably already know, but I'll say it anyhow. The only actor who does a great job in this film is Haley Joel Osment. He is really great. Forget The Sixth Sense he is better in this one, so believable and unlike his character so realistic (as far as I can tell). BRAVO!
Basically I feel that this is the perfect Kubrick Tribute though, for as always with a Kubrick film many will love it and many will hate it. I mean, I myself do not like many of his (full length) movies. Well actually, only two of his movies I've seen (which are: The Shining, Dr. Strangelove, A Clockwork Orange, Spartacus, Full Metal Jacket, A Space Odyssey) I pretty much like. Spartacus and Dr. Strangelove. Spartacus was pretty OK, but Dr. Strangelove I found pretty entertaining, I have to say (I hereby recommend it). I even found the oh so GREAT' 2001: A Space Odyssey so boring I turned it off after a half an hour or so.
Despite all my criticism, there is one thing sure for me: This film will receive Oscar nominations and maybe even win one or two of those shiny, nice, little statues. It will surely be nominated for Best Special Effects and Best Actor (Osment). Maybe even nominations for editing, cinematography, direction and music. My guess is that this film will win effects (if Lord of the Rings won't beat it) and I hope someone will finally give one of these little statues to that little guy with the big talent. Good luck!!!
6 out of 10 (only a bit better than average because of effects and a whole lotta Osment)
(P.s.: I want to say here, that I hope the rumor that Steven Spielberg will delete the sentence You look like a terrorist' in E.T.'s 20th anniversary edition, is NOT true. I do not have anything against mourning and tributes or adding scenes that were not possible. But in that time there were not terrorists, so why make that change now. It then does not reflect the 1980's thinking anymore. I hope he won't do that, cause I know the original all my life, plus I think it is really too EXTREME!!! Plus what will he change it into??? Maybe he can convince me, although I don't think so.)",A.I. Artificial Intelligence

Apparently the budget for this movie is given as 90 million US dollars....what a waste.... This is a rambling sprawling yarn which takes a pathetic and unnecessarily pessimistic view of life and suggests to me it is a reflection more upon the mental anquish of the writers and producers rather than anything else. The director has a famous track record and should stick to that rather than a totally nonsensical screen play, with certain sinister snipes at main stream religion which uses the likes of Robin Williams as a voice over to assist in the propagation of that prejudice. There are ""bits and bobs"" of the likes of ET and Close Encounters and 2001 ""A space idiocy"" thrown it here and there....and one is left with the distinct impression that was ""movie"" is very much made up as as it goes along. That totally over-rated ham actor Jude Law is given a role that is pointless and we of course have to have the ridiculous anorexic close encounter aliens thrown in at the end for good measure. The story starts in the way future with the creation of a life like robotic child and the theme for the remainder of this totally too long film is the desire in the robot for a mothers love which as afore mentioned seems to be something lacking in the writers own angst and is a self indulgent guilt trip. The robotic child is ""adopted"" by a human family but even at this early stage in this flick one starts to lose faith in the integrity of the picture since we have the ""mother"" doing the house hold chores in 1950's style which is patently absurd. The rest of the movie just spins along in a totally out of control way with neither meaning, logic or sense. i have rated this 2 out of 10 and it only just avoided 1 out of 10 due to the excellent art and special effects etc; but no matter how good those technical achievements are......it is still a trash story.",A.I.

You would have to be made of...well, METAL (and/or stone) to resist relating to (and feeling) his emotionally wrenching desire for his mommy's love, but his David is heart-breaking not because he TRIES to make you feel, but because he actually believes what he is projecting on the screen - he is one of THOSE kind of actors, who go inside the role - deep, deep inside - the same way he did in The Sixth Sense and the virtually-too-sad-to-be-watchable-by-the-end Pay It Forward.
Jude Law is also perfectly believable as a mecha gigolo (the ultimate boy-toy!?) - the way he stands, his face, the way he moves - another brilliant performance from an always-fascinating actor.  Loved the teddy bear too.The film would be a 10 if it weren't for the fact that it seems (upon the 3rd viewing - wasn't sure the first two times) not quite connected; it's like each act is a different movie in itself, and if Haley Joel hadn't provided such a powerfully strong emotional center the film would have been completely sprawled out of control.  Give this boy an Oscar NOW.

This film ""A.I."" or ""Artificial Intelligence"" was released in 2001 and whilst it had some beautiful ideas and potential, ultimately this film was disappointing.When Monica (Frances O'Connor) and Henry (Sam Robards) Swinton's son Martin is ill and cryogenically frozen, it is through the wonders of modern technology that they are presented with David (Haley Joel Osment), an artificial child to give their love. Eventually upon the healing of Martin, a decision is made regarding David and David is forced, with his Teddy, to search the world looking for a blue fairy and a chance to become a real boy.In ""Artificial Intelligence"", the modern moral dilemmas regarding artificial lifeforms is brought to the forefront. With terrified humans killing the robots they fear so much, we are shown the typical fear that we will become obsolete. On the other side of the equation we are also presented with people like Professor Allen Hobby (William Hurt) who creates David and who believes in the benefits of artificial lifeforms. This typical argument between the scientist and the religious is brilliantly shown in this film and is one of the few highlights.Aside from the discussion of the benefits and flaws of artificial intelligence, this film should be a beautiful piece of cinema, but sadly it just doesn't click. Whilst during the middle of the film, David's adventures with fellow artificial life form Gigolo Joe (Jude Law) are actually quite enjoyable. The problems with this film are it's beginning and it's end.At the start of this feature, David begins without emotion and as a result is positively disturbing, resembling more a demon child than a loving child. This drags slightly and never really gets going. It is only after David's abandonment by his mother that the film kicks into gear.Skipping however long it might be, the ending of this film is worse than the beginning. Without giving too much away, when watching ""Artificial Intelligence"", it feels like Spielberg has tried to simply extend the run time when it isn't necessary. For the last thirty minutes, so many viewers sit in agony just waiting for the film to finish. There are one or two clever points in which the film could be finished and it could be quite a satisfactory conclusion, unfortunately, the film isn't finished at this moment and by the end the viewer is left feeling less satisfied and more disappointed.It's hard to understand aspects of the logic behind this film and why certain things happen as they do. What is even harder to understand is the logic behind including the final thirty minutes. If Spielberg had ended this film when he should have, ""Artificial Intelligence"" could potentially be up there in the top films of all time. Sadly, due to the excruciating ending, ""Artificial Intelligence"" ends up as an almost ran which had potential but ultimately failed. If there is ever a shorter edit created of this film, watch that. If not though, it's probably worth avoiding, simply because you'll hate Spielberg for running it's potential.",A.I.

97,bellino-angelo2014,"Not perfect, but still intelligent, haunting and moving",7,29 October 2019,"Steven Spielberg's ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE: AI is still, after 18 years from its release, considered by some a mixed bag and by some one of Steven Spielberg's lesser movies. I have to admit that after I saw it I could see the reasons why most people complained about this movie, but I also liked it for what it was. Now I can go to the review.The movie is set in 2125, after the ocean tides destroyed many of the world's most beautiful cities. Humans created Mechas, robots that are very similar to humans. Professor Hoby (William Hurt) created a Mecha child named David (Haley Joel Osment) with the purpose of being the first Mecha to experience emotions like a human being. David is adopted by Henry and Monica Swinton, a couple that has another child named Martin that is not at home at the moment because of a illness of which he suffers. Unfortunately though, Martin is cured and returns home, and since he never heard of Mechas before he treats David like a tool, with consequental poor figures. During a pool party David drags Martin in the pool. Soon the parents decide to abandon Martin in the woods with his talking teddy bear.From here the movie unfolds and it's mostly David's journey for trying to returning home; passing first to a carnival in which he escapes death because he looks like a real human, he becomes friends with Gigolo Joe (Jude Law), a male prostitute that is a fugitive after a murder and helps him finding the blue Fairy since David hopes to become a real boy after he thinks that his mother abandoned him because he is a robot. After Joe and David arrive to Manhattan David finally finds his creator and he discovers a shocking truth: the creator (Michael Mantell) created David as a fotocopy of his dead son and he made hundreds of copies of him. After a hopeless research for Monica and Gigolo Joe is captured by the police, David and Teddy end underwater and freezed.The movie then moves to 4125. Now human race is extinct and David and Teddy are then found and brought back to life by a group of Mechas that also want to know more about humans since they never met them. David finally meets the Blue Mecha. So David asks her to become a human boy, but it's impossible even for her standards. But he has a chance: since Mechas can replicate DNA, they replicate Monica's body with her DNA. After eons of pain David finally reunites for only one day with his mother spending a great day together before turning off forever.So, is this movie great or bad? I wouldn't say neither but it's good in its own, unique way. In some ways the plot is a bit reminiscent of PINOCCHIO but in a futuristic setting. The performances by the cast are good and heartfelt and especially Osment gives a moving performance, but so moving that after he is abandoned you'll only root for him for the rest of the movie. Steven Spielberg's direction is good as always though the cinematography at times looks a bit dated for 2001 standards.However, I didn't loved nor hated the movie. Just didn't surprised me well enough but I still found it good and very moving.",A.I. Artificial Intelligence
98,johnstonjames,A Genuine Examination Of Intelligence And The Soul Of Thought,10,22 January 2012,"to be perfectly honest, sci-fi is hardly my favorite genre. usually i find the sci-fi genre trite, predictable and overwrought. especially these days when the sci-fi channel has reduced the genre to cheaper by the dozen commonness. i mean there are so many sci-fi films these days. most of it a pseudo masquerade of science speculation.i do think, however, that when science fiction is good it can be the most arresting and challenging of thought provoking cinema. i have a sort of trinity as my favorite science fiction cinema. my three favorite science fiction film are, '2001', 'Clockwork Orange' and this film 'AI'. oddly Kubrick was responsible and involved in all these projects. but that wasn't the criteria. it is the content of the films themselves. even if Kubrick wasn't involved i would have chosen these films simply based on what they are about and represent. i consider these three films to be the top of the genre. the only sci-fi that even compares are films like the original 'Andromeda Strain', 'Fahrenhiet 451', 'Apollo 13', or the 70's classic 'Silent Running'.Steven Spielberg can often be hit or miss. he gives us mawkish, sentimental schmaltz like the babyish 'ET' or the lackluster and cloying 'Close Encounters', or worse, like the idiotic 'Minority Report'. he also gives us sci-fi brilliance like the on mark adaptation of the H.G. Wells novel 'War of the Worlds' and this film, 'AI'. 'AI' is such deeply thoughtful science fiction that you sort of wonder what could have possibly gone wrong with his earlier science fiction works. every thing here is not only conceived with intelligence and true scientific speculation, but he is completely in control as a filmmaker and writer. i guess Speiberg is just sort of unpredictable because he is simply human and flawed. ain't we all.most sci-fi, especially these days on sci-fi channels, can be aggrandized silly fantasy with very little serious speculation about what real science embodies. even a fantasy writer such as Ray Bradbury felt a lot of current sci-fi was more concerned with comic book silliness than actual ""science"". mostly i feel the same. a lot of what you see is about some corny super hero or aliens and monsters. very little seems inspired by any kind of plausible reasoning or speculation. but when it is good, sci-fi, even when currently impossible, can inspire the imagination to develop impossibilities into reality. that is why the nature of sci-fi fantasy is so crucial to development of human thought. when done right, sci-fi , even though speculative and often impossible, can stimulate the imagination to stretch itself to create science possibilities.there is so much to discuss and recommend about Speiberg's brilliant 'AI' that there isn't enough room on IMDb to give it analytical justice. not only is 'AI' probing science theory, it is also a journey of discovery into the very nature of human thought and the very nature and motivation of organic intelligence.this movie is also some of the most complete science fiction cinema ever conceived. not only does it boast some cutting, ahead of it's time CGI FX and spectacular fantasy visions, it also has a well written script and excellent acting and genuinely moving dramatic emotions.the acting is of the highest demand. Haley Joel Osment is brilliant beyond his years and not only establishes himself as one of cinema's most memorable child actors along the merits of Shirley Temple, Jodie Foster and Tatum O'Neal, he might possibly have given cinema one of it's best performances period. i always thought the rugrat was pretty impressive in the excellent 'Sixth Sense', but this film most definitely cements it. Jude Law also gives a beautifully well thought performance as a cybernetic gigolo.this film is not just simple pure gold, it's essential to the development of science thought, ethical reasoning, and to the human race in general. unless you have seen 'AI' and given it serious consideration, you can't possibly progress your human experience. it could be one of the most relevant human experiences outside of religious thought. i just can't believe sometimes that a good majority of people can't see or access the importance of this film.the parallels this film makes with the 'Pinocchio' story are profoundly disturbing and often nightmarish, but keenly insightful connections and appropriately analogous. this is in fact somewhat of a 'Pinocchio' fable but without Collodi's demeaning, moralizing judgments. William Hurt is even on hand as a sort of tortured Geppetto figure desperately wishing his creation life and humanness.in fact, this film tackles the folly of moralizing judgment as witnessed in the bitter displacement of organic, human beings who wage a sort of class warfare at the expense of hapless cybernetics in the horrifying 'Flesh Fair' sequence which indicts human cruelty and the essence of scape goating blame. a very human response and emotion when helpless.look, i'm not saying that actual artificial intelligence is any more possible than hovercraft vehicles, warp speed, time travel, or any other of the impossibilities explored in science fiction films, but as in the case of '2001' and it's intelligent computer system 'HAL', it's speculation that warrants consideration.if anyone reads this review and has not experienced this important and poignant cinema masterwork of analysis of the condition of existence, i suggest you see it for the sake of your very humanity. it's a imperative fictional experience that can prove to be quite rewarding. you may in fact, get a minor glimpse into the mind of God and the explanation of existence. let this film guide you to conscious enlightenment. and yes, i'm completely serious.",A.I.

101,perfectbond,Somewhat marred,8,10 December 2003,"A.I. was extremely thought provoking, technically brilliant and also very moving. The performances were also uniformly excellent, especially young Osment's. I agree the film's extended ending drags too long and dilutes the impact of the film. I guess Spielberg wanted David to find in some respect what he was looking for instead of giving us the difficult ending that people are far often searching endlessly often fruitlessly for what they desire most. Still for its many successes and sheer ambition, I strongly recommend this film, 8/10.",A.I. Artificial Intelligence
102,Son_of_Mansfield,"Like Mechas, a wonder of technological achievement without a heart.",7,8 March 2005,"This film is extremely beautiful in it's use of color, especially in Rouge City. The shot of the ""full moon on the rise"" grabs me as well. The effects are also very impressive regarding the Mecha characters, but the movie is at war with itself. Steven Spielberg and Stanley Kubrick have very different styles that do not mesh well. Spielberg is known for big budget summer movies while Kubrick is known for rough portraits of ugly reality. Kubrick was right to hand this movie to Spielberg, but Steven was too busy making spectacular visuals and paying tribute to Kubrick to make a good film. My biggest problem is the evil humans. We are made to relate to David, because he is more human. The thing is Haley Joal Osment plays the robot too well. He is super creepy and I didn't like him at all. I wanted at least one nice human. I think that Jude Law as Gigolo Joe and Jack Angel(Darkwing Duck!) as the voice of Teddy overshadow Osment's David, because they are more lifelike than he is. Joe's strut and Teddy's concern trump David's brooding. When Teddy and Joe aren't on screen the movie crawls along. William Hurt, Brendan Gleeson, and Enrico Colantoni are good in small roles, while Robin William, Ben Kingsley, Chris Rock, and Meryl Streep provide voices. The best thing about this movie is that Spielberg must have learned something as Minority Report is a much more coherent and complete movie.*Teddy: I am not a toy.*",A.I. Artificial Intelligence
103,FloatingOpera7,Possibly The Most Moving Sci-Fi Tale Of All,10,10 April 2006,"Artificial Intelligence: Starring Haley Joel Osment, Jude Law, William Hurt, Sam Robards, Jake Thomas, Frances O'Connor, Director, Stephen Spieldberg, Writer Stanely Kubrick, 2001 A.I. was released in the summer of 2001. That pivotal year would see the unforgettable atrocity of 9/11 and a country headed for war. It was all the more appropriate that this emotional, human story appeared on the big screen. Based on sci-fi writer Brian Aldiss' short novel ""Super Toys Last All Summer Long"", its adaptation into film was the concept of famous director Stanely Kubrick (2001 Space Odyssey) who called dibbs to this project but died shortly after directing Eyes Wide Shut in 1999. This film is truly poignant and heart-felt, with a strong, human message concerning the power of love. The cinematography is stunning as we are transported to a world of the future where robots and humans live side by side. It looks frighteningly like cloning sometimes and so this film's premise about the replacement of a son is not too far-fetched. There are echoes of Spieldbergs' classic E.T. and Empire of the Sun. Haley Joel Osment plays David a mechanical child custom made by an experimental Professor (William Hurt) to think and feel as human as possible. Henry and Monica, his adopted parents, nearly lose their biological son Martin in an accident. Henry decides to replace the son with this mecha but Martin recovers and the two must now live as siblings. Conflict ensues as Martin grows to hate the brother and becomes deeply jealous of his mother's affections for him. He manipulates things so that Monica can turn against David and she is left with no choice but to abandon him out in the woods, his only companion another mechanical toy bear Teddy. The story becomes more and more about the search for happiness (the quest of all humans) when David, inspired by the fairy tale Pinnochio which Monica read to him every night, goes out in search of the Blue Fairy. Jude Law plays Joe, a lovable robotic male prostitute who attempts to help the boy on his quest. Guest star voices include Robin Williams as Dr. Know, a computer system who knows everything about everything, quotes from a 19th century poem ""Come Away, O Fairy Child To The Ends Of The Earth Where The Lions Weep, For The World Is Full Of More Sorrow Than You Will Ever Know..""...and the voice of Chris Rock (briefly in the Flesh Flair scene as his mecha is loaded into a cannon). Things end tragically for David, as he commits suicide and is encased in ice under water, praying fervently that his Blue Fairy will grant his wish. It does end up coming true as eons later, when the world has been damaged by polar ice caps melting, aliens visit the ruined earth and discover the only link to humanity. David is now the only true human, the only thing left that is good and pure in humanity. The aliens tap into his memories and grant his wish. Monica, his mother, returns for one day to accep him as her only child, for one eternally long day. Then they both fall asleep into non-existence. This is a bittersweet film, full of dark and light. Quite seriously, it should have won an Oscar for Best Picture. It's far more than a science-fiction tale. It was my pick for the best film of that year and one of all time.",A.I. Artificial Intelligence
104,skepticskeptical,Do Spielberg and Kubrick mix?,4,16 July 2014,"Artificial Intelligence ends up being less than the sum of its parts. I am a big fan of many of the works of Spielberg and Kubrick. Both have created resplendent masterpieces. This collaboration, however, is something of a mess. It's not abysmal, but it strikes me as akin to the filmic equivalent of a garbage pizza. Lots of good ingredients thrown together pell-mell to produce something rather unappetizing.The idea for a good film--or five--is here somewhere, but it's so tangled up with so many other ideas none of which is ever resolved in any satisfactory way, that it's hard to see what exactly the take-away was supposed to be. Monica loves David because David loves Monica but not enough to persuade her husband to keep him around. From there everything devolves into a ""please every crowd member with something or other"" adventure action-flick. The film starts down one path for a while, but when it becomes clear that there isn't enough interesting material there, then it lurches in another direction before abandoning that path as well. Maybe this is a case of production fund surfeit? Not sure.I had no idea what this film was going to be about. I am not sure what I was doing in 2001, but I never read or heard anything about Artificial Intelligence. I picked up the DVD at the library under the assumption that it would offer some sort of eye-opening perspective on technology. It tries to, but falls flat because of the incoherent schmaltziness. It just doesn't work. It seemed initially that this was going to be a deep philosophical reflection on love and perhaps even a critique of selfishness and possessiveness. The idea of wanting a robot to love one's self unconditionally and unilaterally--is that really so different from getting a dog? I have to wonder. It's not really like Pascal's Wager, which exhorts would-be believers to go through the motions of religious faith, and one day they will find that they truly believe. That probably works because on some subconscious level the mind recognizes that if the person is doing all of this stuff for God, then if God doesn't exist, that can only mean that the person is flaming mad, complete with visions, voices and ubiquitous spies. But that's another story.The combination of Color Purple-style emotional string pulling and A Clockwork Orange's brazen amoralism doesn't work in this production. It's like oil and water. The movie is also too long, and the utterly gratuitous Jude Law character, to be perfectly frank, just seems like an effort to compensate for some of the vacuity of the main storyline. He plays the role of a gigolo robot--in effect, a man-shaped, walking and talking dildo. I'm not making this up.I do not recommend Artificial Intelligence. It's not the worst movie I've seen, but it's nowhere near any of the masterpieces created by Spielberg or Kubrick individually. Some of the scenes are well composed, but taken together as a work? This is truly a mess. Sometimes less is more.",A.I. Artificial Intelligence
105,Movie-12,One of the year's best films -- thought-provoking and deeply moving. ***1/2 (out of four),9,2 August 2001,"AI - ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE / (2001) ***1/2 (out of four)By Blake French:	""AI - Artificial Intelligence"" is the hardest kind of movie to review-but it's also the most enjoyable kind of movie to watch. It's been over three weeks since my screening of Steven Spielberg's emotionally harrowing epic about a robot boy.  Before writing my review, I wanted to let its themes, content, and characters sink into my head and make a solid impact. The film was based on an idea by Stanley Kubrick, but when he died in 1999, Speilberg took charge of the project. I could spend pages discussing the techniques of Kubrick's intentions and Spielberg's decisions, but I will not. Stanley Kubrick and Steven Spielberg are two of the greatest directors American cinema has to offer; it's pure pleasure watching their ideas clash and flow.	 I am not going to examine each individual theme here, either. That would ruin the movie for you. ""AI - Artificial Intelligence"" presents many themes on screen, but it's important to take what you get out of it. Whenever I read a review of Kubrick's ""A Clockwork Orange"" or ""2001: A Space Odyssey"" I feel influenced by the reviewer's interpretation of the movie's themes. Every time I watch either of those movies I get something new out of it. I hate it when other critics state the movie's themes on paper as if it's a fact. There is far too much room for interpretation to reveal this movie's message, or the message of any Kubrick film for that matter. Ask 100 people, and you might get 100 different answers. ""AI - Artificial Intelligence"" is that kind of movie-one of the year's best.Critics and audiences alike have torn apart this movie's ending-a clear miscalculation by Spielberg. If Kubrick were in charge, the movie would have called it quits about twenty minutes earlier in an unsettling sequence that takes place in the ocean. But Speilberg, who always seems entranced by science fiction, injects an additional segment into the mix that does not work quite as well, but isn't so completely awful that it deserves such harsh criticism. It still leaves us with an open, startled emotional disorientation. I left the theater with tears in my eyes. The movie before the conclusion is so complex, moving, and involving in so many different ways the last twenty minutes didn't even come close to spoiling the movie for me.	""AI"" transpires sometime in the near future after the polar ice caps have melted and flooded coastal cities and reduced natural resources. Mechanical androids have become popular since they require no commodities. Reproduction has also become highly illegal. Machines provide sexual services and if anyone wants a child, they will purchase a robot. However, the difference between a robot child and a living child is that robots cannot love. That's the task professor Hobby (William Hurt) of Cybertronics Manufacturing has solved. He has made a robot child that can love. 	We can separate ""AI"" into two separate segments.  I do not want to reveal too much about each plot because the pleasure of watching this movie evolves from the revealing of the connecting plots. I will, however, briefly say the first details a robot child's interaction within a family, and the second deals with the robot's estrangement from its family and the quest to regain the mother's love. I can imagine the material in Kubrick's hands. The movie's opening scene has a female robot begin to undress in a public office. Speilberg cuts the action before she reveals any explicit nudity. Kubrick would have had various shots of full frontal nudity. Spielberg, never comfortable with sexual material, leaves out much of the motivation behind Kubrick's ideas. One of the biggest problems in ""AI"" is the lack of edge with the sexual content. Jude Law plays a robot gigolo who lives in a sex fantasy called Rouge City where people from everywhere come to seek sexual satisfaction. The central character, a robot boy played by Haley Joel Osment, motivates every action in the story except for the scenes in Rouge City. Why contain such a perverse character and setting when his entire existence simply displays a mood that has already been well established.  Obvious, the filmmakers toned the aspects of ""AI"" down to warrant a gutless PG-13 rating-but why? The movie isn't appropriate for children anyway, and it's far too complex. Undoubtedly if Kubrick were in charge ""AI"" would have to be re-cut to avoid an NC-17 rating. Spielberg should have either taken advantage of the perverse material or completely eliminated it.
	Here I am, doing exactly what I said that I wouldn't do, and at nearly 900 words, I still have not clearly expressed my own opinions on the film. I have many notes in front of my that display my reaction as I watched the film, but I am not going to use them-they reveal too much about the movie. ""AI"" is a very personal film, a deeply moving, scientific, careful, and harrowing motion picture that displays startling talent on screen and behind the scenes. The special effects are extraordinary. The performances are alarming-the immensely talented Haley Joel Osment may once again be up for an Academy Award nomination. Go see the movie, then talk about it with others. It's the kind of film that you can spend hours thinking about, then go see it again.",A.I. Artificial Intelligence
106,virek213,A.I.--A Film With Heart And Brains,10,6 July 2001,"Steven Spielberg's latest movie A.I.: ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE, which he took up at the encouragement of the late, great Stanley Kubrick, has caused widely divergent comments.  And I can't help wondering if the most scathingly negative reviews of this movie aren't just an open desire to see Spielberg crash, as he had with ""1941"" and HOOK.For my money, Spielberg has done it again with this futuristic science fiction drama, regardless of what the negative reviews say.  Its story of a robot boy (Haley Joel Osment) who desires to be a real boy in a far future in which humans (Orgas) and machines (Mechas) exist side-by-side but not always in harmony is very much modeled on the Pinocchio story, though it is actually based on a 1969 short story by Brian Aldiss.  It raises some interesting and sometimes unsettling moral dilemmas that few films of late have done.  Can a parent love a child, even if that child is not real?  What might happen if that child desired to be real?  How will Man and Machine be able to co-exist?Like all intelligent science fiction, such as Kubrick's own 2001: A SPACE ODYSSEY and Spielberg's own CLOSE ENCOUNTERS, A.I. forces us to ponder where we've been and where we might be going.  It's an incredible combination of Kubrick's icy intellectual and clinical mind and Spielberg's emotional heart; and I think it works exceedingly well.  But it forces the viewer to not leave their heart and brains at the door, which I think is why it is being so negatively received in this season of mindless summer movie fare. It may be too intelligent for its own good, and many don't have the 145 minutes of patience needed for the movie.  I did, however; and I would call this an absolute masterpiece.

107,FlickJunkie-2,A bad day at the office for Spielberg,6,6 April 2002,"One would think that a science fiction film produced and directed by Steven Spielberg (who also contributed to the screenplay) inspired by the vision of the late Stanley Kubrick would have to be a brilliant work of monumental significance.  Think again.This story was a passion for Kubrick, who always wanted to film it. Spielberg picked it up as homage to Kubrick and attempted to imbue it with Kubrickian nuances.  While the film is clearly infused with the sci-fi spirit of 2001: A Space Odyssey, it has neither the dramatic power nor the philosophical depth of that classic.  Instead, we have an insignificant and disjointed human interest story, full of sentimental pap about a boy who isn't even human.To be sure, the visual effects are outstanding.  With Spielberg at the helm, this was bound to be a given.  Using the latest technology and a $90 Million budget, Spielberg cranks out another effects show that rivals his latest Jurassic Park episode (another dud of a screenplay with great visuals). However, the story never gets any traction and we are left hoping the characters would just shut up and get to the next computer generated image.The first hour of the movie is boring and tedious as we see robot boy David (Haley Joel Osment) attempt to adapt to his new human family and vice versa. Then suddenly Spielberg tries to shake thing up by throwing David into the standard futuristic anarchical society, a backdrop long ago rendered hackneyed in this genre.  Shifting into third gear, we are then taken on a sci-fi junket to old New York, now semi-submerged from the effects of global warming, which have caused the oceans to rise at least 200 feet to cover all but the highest skyscrapers (we cannot possibly have a sci-fi film lately without some political hyperbole lurking in the subtext).  Then fourth gear and we go on a journey far into future where David comes face to face with advanced beings in his quest to become a real boy, just like Pinocchio.Spielberg attempts to meld ET, Close Encounters of the Third Kind and 2001 A Space Odyssey, to create a mosaic of themes that does justice to none of them.  The last segment is punctuated by the advanced beings driveling about how the human race is the one true link to the meaning of life.  This is extremely ironic given the events of David's journey including vile children mocking him, parents who abandon him, a flesh fair and a futuristic red light district full of violence and debauchery.The film is also full of annoyingly unbelievable depictions, such as a love robot (Jude Law) who is a sophisticated piece of technology able to reason and operate at a very high level, who has to crick his neck to turn on his mood music.The acting is terrific, despite the vapid dialogue.  Haley Joel Osment just keeps getting better and better.  He presents just the right balance of robotic disconnection with his human counterparts and the sincere efforts of an emotional being attempting to emerge.  Jude Law also gives another outstanding performance as Joe Gigolo, stealing just about every scene in which he appears.This was supposed to be one of the all time blockbusters, but despite putting up decent numbers, it failed to even match its budget at the box office.  For once, I have to agree with the masses that this film just failed to distinguish itself beyond the special effects.  I rated it a 6/10. Mark it up as a bad day at the office for Steven Spielberg.",A.I. Artificial Intelligence

109,Bogmeister,The Robot-boy who would be a Boy,7,13 January 2006,"The saga of a robot, built in the year...waitaminnit. Didn't I type this before? Yes, yes...for my comment on ""Bicentennial Man""(99). Yes, the robot which yearns to be human. Hm, yes, not a very original thought by this time. Spielberg rushed out this concept based on plans Stanley Kubrick made before he died. Kubrick would have taken at least a couple of years longer and it would have showed. Right as the film's narration begins, we're rushed into an explanation of how the icecaps have melted in the near future, flooding all coastal cities (shades of ""Waterworld""). The resulting displacement of huge amounts of people caused some birth control measures, thereby jumpstarting a robot industry (usually referred to as 'mechas' here). I guess it makes some sense, so far. What follows is another variation on Spielberg's fascination with fairy tales - in this case a reworking of Pinnochio (which is spelled out more than once during the film, ad nauseum). Subtleties are not present; instead of gradually working in the premise, Spielberg has scientist Hurt clumsily spell it out in the beginning - let's build a robot who can love. Gee whiz, really? OK, let's. And let's make it a boy robot, because maybe - uh oh - the scientist has some personal stake in this deceptively high-end concept to advance the scope of human knowledge and science. The film's strong points are its ambition. The future landscape presented here also reminded me a bit of ""Blade Runner""(82) - a fantastical, alien and truly futuristic feel (except for the tacky future cars on rural roads and a suburban pool straight out of the eighties). It's uneven, though all the big city visuals and scenes with the mechas succeed. But this is the 3rd film I've so far mentioned AI reminded me of, which points to a weakness - it's definitely derivative - probably because it was rushed, as mentioned. And though the story is surprisingly hard-edged and even adult for the most part, Spielberg reverts to a very saccharine climax, intended, it seems, for science fiction fans in the 7-year-old age group. Heavy and deep concepts having to do with the nature of being human, of the supposedly special nature of humanity, are brushed over rather than tackled, in favor of the fairy tale aspect. What the hell was Hurt really intending or planning in the end? We'll never know - probably because the filmmakers didn't either. I didn't mind the sudden new time era in the final 15 minutes since at least it was a genuine surprise and innovative by today's standards. But the last minute was a bit of a cheat - nowhere to go but the big sleep. Picture Spielberg tucking in the audience after feeling guilty for traumatizing them.",A.I. Artificial Intelligence
110,famousgir1,A Steven Spielberg Masterpiece.,10,22 September 2001,"No words can describe how amazing A.I. Artificial Intelligence is. It's just one of those movies, which is absolutely perfect in every way. A.I. definitely deserves many Oscar nominations, including ones for Best Director, (Steven Spielberg.) Best Screenplay, (Steven Spielberg.) and Best Actor (Haley Joel Osment.) I *really* hope they win too.The movie is about David, a robot child who wants to become a real boy, so he can be loved by his human mother. David is played the amazing Haley Joel Osment, who is so believable in his role. You really feel that he's a robot child, just wanting to be loved. Jude Law is also good as Gigolo Joe, a robot guy who befriends David. Then you have, Frances O'Connor who plays (And, does a good job.) Monica. She and her husband are the ones, who take David into there home, at first. Davids teddy, 'Teddy' is also really cute. The movie is of course directed by the BEST director around, Steven Spielberg who does such a wonderful job as usual. Thank you, Steven. Some parts of the movie, had me in tears, especially, the ending. Still, I'm glad everything worked out at the end. There's a nice musical score here too, which makes the soundtrack also really great. The only thing left to say is, if you haven't seen A.I. then what are you waiting for. It's an amazing movie about a must-see for everyone. It's now one of my all time favourite movies. And, I give the BRILLIANT, A.I. a 20/20. See this movie NOW.",A.I. Artificial Intelligence

112,johnnymonsarrat,Jon Monsarrat review: painfully arty w/ plot holes,2,13 April 2002,"""Artificial Intelligence: AI"" is first and foremost a drama with a heavy dose of art. Personally, I don't have the film school training and sophistication to enjoy, for example, the makeup and scenery even if the story is horrid and the characters uninteresting (""The Piano""). And long drawn-out melodramatic scenes just bore me (""Forrest Gump"").And that's what happens in AI. The story is long, very long, and the characters make some decisions that don't really make sense.I do like SF, and there are a few science fiction themes but it doesn't make up for the rest. There is an attempt to flirt with deep issues, but it doesn't work for me. Here is an example that won't spoil the movie. Advertisements for the film keep saying ""Can a human love a machine?"", as though that were a deep and mysterious question. But then, the entire emotive direction of the film is to get the viewer to empathize with the hapless machine, which we do quite readily. Actually, instantly. So it's not much of a question.The ending, which everyone has complained about, wasn't that bad. Sort of a neat twist. The real problem is that the film doesn't fit into a story arc. You know, a mystery movie begins with a crime and ends with solving it. You get some foreshadowing. Because ""AI"" changes character throughout, you're not sure what to root for. It's like a series of skits, none of which reach a satisfying conclusion.In other words, a perfect Stanley Kubrick film for you arty types out there. But not for me. Sci-fi film lovers, stay away and save yourself! This film does not have the charm and deep intelligence of ""2001: A Space Oddessy"".Who should see this film:-- arty types. I respect your viewpoint but frankly I don't get it.-- I can't think of anyone elseI'm forced to give ""AI"" a 2 out of 10 because it was actually painful to watch.",A.I. Artificial Intelligence

114,ruby_fff,Not really for kids - subject matter more for grownups to ponder,7,21 July 2001,"Talented Haley Joel Osment is the core reason to see A.I.  He is amazing - a fantastic child actor. Two hours and thirteen minutes is rather long for a movie that could have spared a segment or two: the Flesh Fair bit and Rouge City. Actually, Jude Law's character we just might do without should the film be more focused to include younger audience. (I like Jude Law, he's terrific in: Enemy at the Gates 2001; Talented Mr. Ripley 1999; GATTACA 1997.) I quite enjoy his brief exchange with Osment's David in the woods, when he did a dance like movement quite reminiscent of Tommy Steele in ""Finian's Rainbow"". With Law's part of Gigolo Joe in a Blade Runner sin city scenario, the Mad Max: Beyond Thunderdome like fanfare sequence, and especially the Night of the Living Dead kind of imagery on screen that can be scary to a tender age group - A.I. is really not for kids, in spite of the wonderful presence of Haley Joel Osment. Well, no Kubrick's film is for kids, anyway. There we are. The story premise is more for the adults, and the idea of (mass) producing a robot child catered to the parents is more of a challenging question to ponder for the society of man/humans. Without a doubt, the film is superb in its technical production, set design, cinematography, and visual and sound effects. The segments with Frances O'Connor as mother and Osment as David the robot child are the scenes that emanate tenderness and vulnerable human qualities. I also appreciate the talking teddy bear and his enduring (and endearing) relationship with Osment's David. The underwater alien world (of old New York cityscape) and blue fairy myth is a fascinating sequence. While the idea of science supremacy in technically duplicating more look alike David's is sheer horror in itself. Does grief and lost need such a degree of filling the gaps of the human heart? Gigolo Joe is a novel commodity in the future world. Osment's David prototype would have been an ideal dream state with no 'contamination' from the human society - just pure binary goodness. A dream, indeed. A.I. the film feels like Spielberg and Kubrick meeting halfway. The dazzling adventure sequences are truly Spielberg's strokes. The sentiments, somehow, not quite tangibly complete? Perhaps it'd take some repeat viewing and absorption For now, A.I. belongs to Haley Joel Osment - take the journey with a shining star!",A.I. Artificial Intelligence

Yeah, we get it) Jude Law and Osmont manage to survive the film with well acted performances, but the parents come off so annoying and shallow. As the father, Sam Robards gives a wooden performance and he's supposed to be HUMAN!!! Frances O'Connor (who is a good actress) is either miscast or all her good scnes got cut. She comes off as such a neurotic and confused woman that I could have cared less whether David ever finds her or not.

Things which I questioned before made more sense and the acting was terrific. Haley Joel Osment was a real talent to be reckoned with. way beyond his years. Jude Law timed his part perfectly and remains a real favourite with me.Brendan Gleeson was underused and Frances O'Connor hit just the right notes in her part as David's ""Mom"".

122,chrisbrown6453,"Kubrick , Speilberg, I don't know who's fault it is, but someone should sure pay for this horrid ending.",7,9 July 2001,"Please do not be mistaken; this film is an update on ""Pinocchio,"" the classic fairy tale that finds a marionette dreaming to become a real boy. This story is only slightly different. It begins in the mid-21st century, after the polar ice caps have melted and coastal cities have been submersed and abandoned. Lifelike robots, who look and respond just like humans, were first created to handle menial tasks, but now they make up a large percentage of the world's population, dividing citizens into two distinct classes. Orgas are ""organic"" people like you and me. Mechas are ""mechanical"" specialized robots who resemble humans. One of the leading scientists behind the development of these artificial beings is Professor Hobby (Hurt, Lost in Space), who now has a new project in the works. He wants to create a robotic child with the ability to love his owners like parents. Twenty months later, David (Osment, The Sixth Sense) is created. He looks and feels like an average 11 year old boy, but he is nothing more than another robot. This experimental child is given to Henry and Monica Swinton (Sam Robards of American Beauty and Frances O'Connor of Bedazzled), who find themselves mourning for their own extremely ill child. In time, Monica comes to love David as her own and things seem to be working out well for the family. That changes when the Swinton's real son (Thomas, The Cell) recovers, and the two young boys find themseleves competing for their mother's attention. David is quickly pushed to the side and seen as an outcast, especially after putting the family in danger on multiple occasions. Reluctantly, Monica takes David to be destroyed, however, she does not have the heart to do such a horrible thing. She abandons David in the woods with his mechanical lifelike teddy bear (voiced by Angel, who has provided additional voices for animated films like The Little Mermaid and Toy Story). The helpless Mecha does not entirely understand this, and believes that his mother does not like him because he is a robot. If he could become a real boy, like the character in Pinocchio, then Monica would return his love. With that, David sets out in search of the Blue Fairy who will magically turn him into a real boy.At just over two hours long, Artificial Intelligence is divided into three acts. That is the entire first act of the film, which lasts one hour. The second act, and hour of the movie, finds David teaming up with Gigolo Joe (Law of The Talented Mr. Ripley), a lover robot designed specifically to pleasure the opposite sex. Joe is running from the law, and using David as the perfect cover. They visit several eye-popping places in search of the Blue Fairy. The first is the Flesh Fair, where Orgas find happiness in the public torture of Mechas. Second is Rouge City, Joe's stomping grounds, which resembles a darker more explicit version of the Las Vegas strip, or Times Square with a provocative twist. The adventures of David and Joe wind down to an incredibly shocking conclusion. No matter how hard you try, you will not guess where this story is ultimately headed. This surprise ending is actually where the film begins to go wrong, way wrong.  I really enjoyed Artificial Intelligence during the first two hours. After the film moves into the final act, I sat in the theater scratching my head, wondering why the credits weren't rolling yet. Believe me, the film should have ended about 40 minutes before it actually did.  The conclusion is a tad uneven with the rest of the film, and is completely irrelevant to the rest of the film. The main point that I want to stress is the film's dark and unsettling tone. Many will be startled by how uncomfortable Artificial Intelligence feels. Artificial Intelligence is eerie and depressing. Every aspect of this film works to create a mysterious tone that keeps the audience in constant fear of what will happen next. It is not suspense. It is fear. But it is not the same kind of fear that comes along with a blood and guts horror flick. As an audience, we understand what a robot of this power is capable of doing. The result could be very dangerous and potentially fatal. This concept is used against the audience to make them nervous about the material in the film. As in Jaws and Close Encounters of the Third Kind, Spielberg uses the audience's own imagination to enhance the entire experience. Without this fear of the picture, its message would not make as much of an impact. I definitely do not want to scare anyone away from the film though. Again, this is not the kind of fright that makes you want to cover your eyes and hide, but there is certainly no relaxing during this movie.The characters, Mechas more so than Orgas, are fascinating to watch. This is assisted by stellar performances from Osment (who never blinks in the film) and Law, who are both remarkably impressive. The most entertaining aspect of the movie is Teddy, David's full-motion stuffed bear, who provides the warmest scenes in this cold picture, as well as the most interesting special effects in the film. That's not to say that every other computer generated piece in Artificial Intelligence is not up to par. The effects, including a sunken Manhattan skyline and an all-knowing hologram voiced by Robin Williams, are simply mindblowing. Spielberg adds his own brand of groundbreaking special effects to the Kubrick storyline, but does not move away from the deceased filmmaker's cinematic style. As I have said before, this is not a Spielberg movie, nor does it ever feel like one. If anything, this feels like a classic Kubrick film, with a few extra bells and whistles courtesy of Spielberg. The combined sum of all of these elements creates a motion picture unlike anything anyone has ever witnessed.",A.I. Artificial Intelligence

Spielberg has a glorious eye for stunning images and the cinematography is some of the best of the decade. It was all just so beautiful. I was in complete awe during the entire film. As for the story, it was a great commentary on society's refusal to accept anything unique. They see these mechas as a sign of evolution and something different than what they've become accustomed to living with, and in turn feel the need to eradicate them in the most gruesome and disgusting way. The performances from the entire cast are great. Jude Law delivers the second best of his career with a wonderfully charismatic portrayal of a mechanical gigolo. Frances O' Connor was surprisingly brilliant as the highly confused mother who becomes further and further lost with what to do with her life. Haley Joel Osment was also pretty good. The film would make my top list if it wasn't for the ending, which was one of the worst I've ever seen: It was just 15 minutes of me loudly saying ""You've got to be kidding me."" OK, so David is a robot but he can freeze for over two thousand years, and he can just be completely revived by aliens who coincidentally found him. Yeah his circuits wouldn't fry or anything, like they did when he ate freaking spinach. Then, aliens just randomly have the power to bring back people if they have some part of them? Um, OK.

Somehow when they bring back his ""mother"", her love turns him into a real boy, he cries, falls asleep and dies. You've got to be kidding me. The super technologically advanced aliens can bring back people who died, yet they can't turn him from a robot to a real boy? Alright, I got over that.

It raises issues of humanity, but never really tackles them, leaving that for the second act, a dark, imaginative piece that manages to be both entertaining and deep. It's my favourite bit of the film. By the third act, a lot of enjoyment has faded from the film, leaving a deeply though-provoking work that I still don't think I've got a handle on. The gradual shift from light to dark is accomplished well, and the end isn't as frustrating to me as it is to others, but it's more of a flawed masterpiece than an out-and-out one.

130,rooee,Over 2000 reviews says it all,8,12 April 2010,"Stanley Kubrick was right to identify his long-gestating A.I. project as being more aligned to Steven Spielberg's sensibilities. But it's a double-edged sword: the result is a muddled concoction of the latter director's tautest emotional drama, his most sumptuous visual excesses, and his most turgid sentimental stargazing. In that order.The film is inspired by the short story Super-Toys Last All Summer Long by Brian Aldiss. The first reel of the film - an eerie family drama with an undercurrent of creeping techno-horror - bears most resemblance to the original text. In spite of key questions going unanswered - literally, what will a robot child become? - it's also the most successful section of the film, with effective performances from Frances O'Connor (as Monica Swinton) and Sam Robards (as Henry Swinton) and a chilling one from Haley Joel Osment as their adopted robot son, David. When Monica and Henry's real son wakes from his coma, Monica cannot face the idea of David being destroyed, and so she dumps him in the woods with his companion Teddy (probably the cutest CG creation ever).And so A.I. broadens its horizons and loses its focus. David and Teddy find themselves at a 'Flesh Fair', where human hicks go to trash their robot counterparts. Here they meet love machine Gigolo Joe (Jude Law) - he's fun, although it's somewhat tan of Spielberg to present him so sexlessly. The fair itself is the one of those slightly cringeworthy depictions of futuristic hedonism where people listen to obnoxious electroclash music and dress in luminous armour. The ensuing adventure takes the robo trio to the sumptuous Rouge City and beyond, to the soggy New York City of the future.From the above it may sound like I loathe the film, but that's not the case. It's themes are expansive and are presented via a fiercely intelligent script. Spielberg not only nails concepts arguably too large to be nailed down - love, loneliness, and mortality - but he also wraps them up in a satisfying five-part narrative structure. The fifth part is as bold as can be - Kubrick would have approved of the 2,000 year leap into the next age, just as he would have appreciated Ben Kingsley's determinably old fashioned opening and closing narration. (There are further cameos from Robin Williams, Meryl Streep, and Chris Rock - keep an ear out.) Like Professor Hobby's (William Hurt) lifelong ambition to manufacture a child capable of love, perhaps the film's ambitions are out of its reach. It will always be the runt in Spielbergs litter. For while films such as War of the Worlds and Hook were of depressingly low quality, both achieved a level of global popularity on which Spielberg has always thrived but which would apply to A.I.

So Steven Spielberg, who basically idolized Kubrick decided to finish it. And when it was released not many people knew what to think. Me personally, I really liked this film, I mean it's not perfect, but the stuff it gets right, it gets really, really, really right.I never got the whole ""Spielberg Smultz,"" thing that people complain about in his movies like ""Hook"" and ""War of the Worlds."" And then I saw this film, and I got it, it's so obvious when Spielberg added something that Stanley Kubrick obviously wouldn't, and it doesn't always fit, and sometimes feels awkward. Some of the characters are pretty bland, and it's just so incredibly depressing at points. I mean some parts are lighthearted, but sometimes the movie is just so meanspirited that it's kind of hard to watch.OK, first good thing, the special effects. This movie is twelve years old and these effects still look fantastic. Almost every single one of them looks real. Two, the main character David, is fantastic, I felt for him, when bad stuff happened to him I wanted to reach in and help him, mostly thanks to Haley Joel Osment's stellar performance. Jude Law was great, and I will have no one tell me otherwise. And the film brings up some great ideas about life, and what it means to truly be alive. It certainly made me question morality more than 2001: A Space Oddysey did.A.I. may suffer from some smultz, but if you can get past it than there is some really good stuff in this film. I recommend it highly to any fan of science fiction.",A.I. Artificial Intelligence

A shame, considering the work laid down to make it a classic. It could have ended with David begging the Blue Fairy to be turned into a real boy - but nopes.

How so?  It does not cater to the popcorn and Jujubee crowd that seems to darken the corners of many an intelligent forum these days.Anyone who thinks Speilberg is there to crank out the same movie OVER AND OVER AGAIN should stay away from this truly great artist's movie from now on. There's always another mindless pit with guns and action that says NOTHING new nor presents nothing truly close to the human heart. Go to see ""Tomb Raider"" instead.  You will be enriched to your shallow heart's and mind's content.Here we have another shockingly beautiful performance by Haley Joel Osment, gorgeous artistic direction, and technical marvels to keep you thinking long after the movie has ended.Of course, this was Stanley Kubrick's project.  We will never know what he would have done with it.  Suffice it to say that Speilberg managed it with virtuosity, grace and aplomb.  I am sure Stanley would have loved it.The visuals, sets and matte artistry were awe-inspiring and lent themselves intimately to the story.The John Williams musical score was prodigious in it's non-intrusive nature and lovely beyond words.  I am one of those people that do NOT run out to see if my car is still in the parking lot.  I stayed until the final notes died away - what a lovely experience.Only one aspect of the film even irked me in the slightest - there was something missing in the writing for the adoptive father.  He seemed to be rather one-dimensional.  First he was all excited about the boy and then all of a sudden he thought the boy was a monster. Too bad.
The passing of time and the appearance of new characters at the end was handled with intelligence and never seemed contrived.ALL IN ALL:  one of the finest NEW things I've seen in a long time.

After all, if man is only a biological machine, then who are we to say that a machine is not human? Confused? Sure, if your understanding of what a human is, then being misled by a ""shuckster"" is easy for them to mislead you.The production is superb, the acting is splendid, the other tasks just as well done. However, the whole story leaves you with mixed feelings leaving nothing defined - thus aiding the ""shuckster"" to confuse you further.

135,LivingDog,"It's a robot, it's a human, it's a robot... ADDENDUM",7,3 December 2002,"This is my 2nd comment on AI. The first one is still accurate but I wanted to add these words to augment the first comment. As I stated the director does not take a position on what the bot-boy is and so you are confronted with various points of view - that is all - no definitive answer there in the movie. I was thinking that a good project would be to count the number of times each side of the argument is stated, those being: he is a bot, or he isn't a bot.There is one point that tends to make me think that the director gave his opinion - the scene where the hanging charm from a mobile is that of a child with a hole in the middle of the chest, in the shape of a heart. This might have been the director putting in his own two cents while trying to allow both sides to ""speak"" in the movie. In short, the director might have been saying: ""David does not have a soul.""However, there is a definitive answer: self-consciousness, or awareness of one's own self. This cannot be programmed nor created - only immitated. Man cannot create self-consciousness. There is only One who creates our consciousness. As such the boy-bot is only, and always will be, just a robot.Dr. Hobby is driven by his compassion for his dead son to create an immitation/substitute for his grieving heart. And it is his single-mindedness that drives him to create a very close approximation to a human child.David is a child stalker of Monika (his Organic ""mother""). This is not love. He feels nothing other than what the programmers put into him in order to ""learn"" how to react when he is ""imprinted"" on Monica. He knows only one way - ""love Mommy."" His ""love"" is single-minded to the point of his: 1) ""praying"" for 2000 years to a lifeless statue to be made real, and 2) accepting a clone of his ""Mommy"" as if she is the same person, 3) he didn't say how much he ""missed"" his ""Mommy."" (his first words to her (after 2000 years) are: ""Do you want some coffee?""(I accept clones as 1) not truly being made by man - man only plants a seed, and 2) as such, they are/will be fully human... God helps us.)There were two features I want to mention that caught my attention as innovative (because of their believability): 1) the character ""teddy"" - very cool ""super-toy,"" (the best lines in the movie are said by this character), and 2) the helicopter David flew around - very cool ""super-toy"" :)Ok. Now here's my opinion on what the movie is *REALLY* about - it's not about if an AI is a real sentient being or not, but rather it's about that man will extinguish himself and all that will remain are our machines - aka ""super-toys."" Simultaneously telling a story about one such ""super-toy"" - a very unique one, called ""David.""Zafoid",A.I. Artificial Intelligence

I've become something of an Internet nerd over the past few years, and this movie polarized people more than any other I've ever encountered.  (Well, unless you count ""Patch Adams"", and I don't.)This is a three-act movie.  As a whole, ""A.I."" gets a lucky seven, but I felt differently about each of it's parts.  So, here comes a three-part review.Part One:  Definitely the best of the lot.  In a strange way, it reminded me of when I saw ""E.T."" for the first time as a little kid.  The whole thing, in both cases, is filmed from the main character's point of view.  Both E.T. and David are well under five feet tall, so everything seems to loom over you, lending a sublimely frightening tone.  Pair that with the fact that David is a very creepy little creature and you have the world's most subversive kid's movie for adults.Part Two:  The second act is very good, introducing the seedier side of this particular fantasy universe and sending David off on his quest.  I don't want to give too much away, but it's nearly a parody of the Disney fairy-tale movies, putting little David in some very real danger, giving him a sex fiend and a virtual pet for his Obligatory Scene-Stealing Sidekicks (actually, Gigalo Joe and Teddy are easily the best characters in the film), and then suggesting that his harrowing journey was futile. 
And, most importantly, there is a point in Act Two where I felt the movie was going to end (I'll only say angel, ferris wheel, and submarine, just so you know when).  The way the story sets itself up, there's really no chance of a happy ending.But then we get Part Three.Part Three:  What... the... hell...?Aside from the silly Deus ex machina (or, rather, machina ex machina, or something) in the final act, this is easily the best overlooked Science Fiction film since ""GATTACA"".

It is a compelling story on so many levels, and pays homage to so many other good SF/fantasy films from the hands of the masters, Kubrick and Spielburg. But what makes this film work is the superior quality of the acting and in particular the acting of Haley Joe Osment. This young man compels you to watch him, and manages to be the focus in a film with a great deal of complexity(as he also does in ""The Sixth Sense"" where he steals the picture from Bruce Willis.) The Jude Law story line was a bit much for a story set for families, but he did an excellent job of integrating into the film. And of course there is the always outstanding musical score of John Williams. Altogether this is a film that will be appreciated in years to come when people look back at it.",A.I.

140,smakawhat,A very difficult subject handled very well,7,17 July 2001,"It is many decades into the future and humankind has developed by leaps in bounds in the world of science and technology.  Nevertheless, it seems this great sophistication wasn't strong enough to stop the water levels from rising and swallowing all of the worlds coastal cities.  As the movie begins we are introduced to a group of robot makers led by professor Allen Hubby (William Hurt) a man who is determined to make a perfect 'mecha' by creating a machine that can express emotion and actually love a subject.  The inspiration is to create a child, perhaps for the need of couples who can't conceive, or for anyone who wishes a child.  Is this fair to play god one might ask?  A being that is in a sense programaticaly perfect for a family? But then a scientist asks a more deeper moral question that of, can a human or even should a human feel emotion for something that may very well show true love but is not REAL?!This premise is the basis for the story behind A.I. and it is a fascinating deep question that doesn't have an answer nor does the movie try to provide one.  Haley Joel Osmont is David the creation of a cybertronic company.  He will be hard wired forever to the family that chooses him, and the company finds the perfect couple who have had a child but has been injured and seems never to live again as he is frozen in a cryogenic state.While the mother is very fearful of this creation her husband brings David home to mend her pain, complications then arise when their natural born son recovers, and is brought back into the family.In a gut wrenching decision the mother decides as much as David will never hate her, she can't accept his love cause he is not a real child and thus abandons him as he is left to ponder his existence and wanting to become a real boy.  This then enters the second half of the story where David realises the value of 'mechas' as he makes friends with a sex-robot named Gigolo Joe (Jude Law) and they try to survive in a much crueler world where mechas are forgotten, and sometimes captured and tortured in live festivals called 'Flesh Fairs'.First off, the acting by Haley is top notch, as is Jude Laws performance as a stud-bot who's only purpose is to please his female customers.  While the movie is a bit long, it's never dull and the idea of attaching emotional connections with an inorganic object is a fascinating one.  Was his mom decision correct?  Was it cruel?  Was it right?  There are also many other aspects to this situation particualrly in the best scene in the film POSSIBLE SPOILER where a 'Flesh Fair' producer captures David and displays him to an audience showing his disgust at David's human-ness.  The producer replies that this is what humanity has done to replace us, and it is vile and must be destroyed.  While in fear David begs for his life and the crowd responds in horror with one spectator claiming that mechas don't beg for their lives.  In the crowds shock they decide to pelt the producer from the stands and storm the venue, allowing David to escape.  But the question is, was the producer wrong?END POSSIBLE SPOILERIt is these challenging questions that made the film engaging, entertaining, and overal very enjoyable for me.  The final ending while interesting is a little confusing (I had another person tell me he thought the last 20 minutes of the film was a horrific idea and in many ways I can believe it). Although no oscar performances are present it is wonderfuly acted, enjoyable and should be seen.

141,bix171,Softies At Work,7,7 April 2002,"The late Stanley Kubrick's coda to a profound film career essentially reiterates the conclusions about love that he examined in his final film `Eyes Wide Shut' and by allowing Steven Spielberg to direct here he receives the reassurances that a family man like Spielberg can provide. As dour as his worldview is, Kubrick has become a softie at heart but he wants it both ways: you should be happy to be alive and you should welcome death as relief as well; Spielberg, with his idealizations of suburban life intermingling with his fantasy escapes into the void, is a perfect foil for this kind of contradictory viewpoint. But the coldness that was the basis for Kubrick's direction is anathema to Spielberg and the humanity he tries to infuse makes the whole thing rather discomfiting. Fortunately, the one-note Haley Joel Osment, playing a robot with the capacity to love searching for the mother who has abandoned him, keeps the proceedings from getting too emotionally taxing, unintentionally allowing you to keep the necessary distance. Spielberg's usual elegant filmmaking is very much in evidence and the film's pacing belies its 145 minute running time.",A.I. Artificial Intelligence
142,Dockelektro,Spielberg's Tour de Force,10,1 October 2001,"If all the movie came out like this one did, I think we would be all very different. This movies marks a new borderline in Spielberg's career, and we can be sure that none will be the same from here. Nurturing the project since a decade ago, Kubrick shared it with him, and the outcome is a hapy marriage of all of Kubrick's perfectionism and Spielberg's trademark sensibility. I am a little lost for words, a thing which happens everytime I go and see a really good movie. I remember being like this in ""Saving Private Ryan"". But I must grab it, I thought ""write this now, or you'll forget it, take it out while it's still fresh"". What shall I say? Spielberg is one of my influences, for the way his genius has matured, for the way he managed to show he is much more than a simple grown-up boy. This movie proves that the devotion and love dedicated to a project may influence greatly the final product. ""A.I."" is a labour of love, and rarely has Spielberg been so personally attached to a movie of his. Movie magic is again the order, as it has been in almost all of his movies (Saving Private Ryan may be the exception), but this time, Spielberg assumes a personal viewpoint, and the movie assumes a posture towards its subjects like he has never did before. This is a true novelty item, far away from the swashbuckling times of Indiana Jones. Steven has matured, and the movie he gives us now is as good as an old wine, but best of all - with the heritage of many years of a magic he imprinted in his movies. All the fine touches are there to go with it: Janusz Kaminski's cinematograpy, Michael Kahn's editing and John Williams' magical score, one of his finest and most beautifully crafted scores to date. I could tell you, if this was Spielberg's last movie, I would have cried my tears out. Because he would have left us with a masterpiece. It touched me, and I am sure that next time it will certainly bring tears to my eyes. Unmissable.",A.I. Artificial Intelligence
143,mnpollio,"An initially promising, but rapidly declining mess",3,13 March 2007,"Much ado was made about the merging of the artistically opposite approaches of Stanley Kubrick and Steven Spielberg on a science fiction film, but if Kubrick had lived and the end results would still have been anything like this finished product then they should never have pooled their talents. Basically a high-tech updating of the Pinnochio legend set in the future. A young couple whose son lies in a comatose state is allowed to road-test an android that resembles a young boy (played by Haley Joel Osment). The father seems oddly uninvolved in the project he initiated, but the mother (Frances O'Connor) blunders ahead and speaks the words that will allow the android to bond to her. Naturally, the couple's son regains consciousness and the android, who now has all of the personality and emotions of a real boy is no longer required. Rather than having him destroyed, the mother abandons him in the wilderness and the android embarks on a physical and psychological journey to become ""real"" so his mother will love him. The opening segments are cold and antiseptic, but intriguing and offer some of the most restrained directorial work that Spielberg has ever done. After the android's abandonment, the film starts to spin out of control. The meandering journey through the wilderness is pointless and starts to wear on the viewer. The addition of a companion in the form of an on-the-run hustler robot named Gigolo Joe (an oddly asexual Jude Law) fails to develop in any conceivable way. By the time the film seems to be staggering towards a climax, it has yet a third jarring tone shift that allows it to play past at least two logical conclusions into a third unendurable hour. The final segment/conclusion comes out of no where and fails to successfully address or explore any of the deep issues that the opening act put forth. The final result is an initially promising film that is ultimately unfocused,dramatically uneven in tone and in desperate need of major editing.",A.I. Artificial Intelligence
144,flicklover,thought provoking!,8,3 July 2001,"I was eagerly awaiting this film, I knew that this was probably going to be one of the only really interesting movies of the summer. First, all of the speculation about this film because of the Kubrick/Spielberg collaboration put an unfair expectations on the film. Cynical critics of Spielberg were ready dismiss the movie as a failed attempt to imitate the great Stanley Kubrick. Though I agree that Kubrick was a master, I honestly think that this material suits Steven Spielberg much better. What the story comes down to is a sci-fi fantasy take on Pinnochio. David(Haley Joel Osment) is a robot boy programmed only to love, he loves his mother, but the real question is, how can his mother return the love, after all he is a machine. David wants to be real, he wants his mother to love him back. He goes on a journey to try become a real boy. Spielberg has created an intriguing world here, there are alot of moments and nods to Kubrick, he respects his colleague but never copies him. Kubrick's style was always ineresting, but cold and distant. Spielberg's style is more inviting, and warm. This movie is not ET though, Steven has grown up. I think that visually it is as ambitious as anything that he has ever done. The movie's ending will leave some wondering if it was necessary, it is at going to seem at first glance simplistic, but thinking about it it is very appropriate. In a summer full of mindless action entertainment, including a so-called historical epic that didn't amount to much(Yes that one!) it is nice to see a film with something to say. The questions asked by the film are not answered, they are to complex to be faithfully be attempted to be answered by a 2 and a half hour movie.

I enjoyed the examination of human love and the story concerning the luddite view towards the mecas but the whole thing about the little boy pining for his mommy's love was way too ETish for an otherwise rather cold movie.  If the movie would have gone closer toward one or the other aspects it may have been more successful.  But to give the movie its due I must admit the special effects were very impressive.  I stepped through a couple of scenes with DVD slowness to try and discern how a particular effect was accomplished and was impressed with the craft.  The scene in the beginning where the meca's face is opened up was stunning.  I gave the movie a higher rating for its craft but I doubt I will revisit the movie as I have revisited Kubrick's movies.

146,Eternality,Artificial Intelligence is an engaging science-fiction adventure that melds Kubrick's chilly bleakness with Spielberg's warm touch.,9,16 December 2010,"If not for his untimely death, this would have been Stanley Kubrick's next film after the mixed critical reaction he received for his last film Eyes Wide Shut (1999). His unfinished project was taken on by his long-time cinematic pal, the illustrious Steven Spielberg, who as a tribute to the great director of Dr. Strangelove (1964), 2001: A Space Odyssey (1968), and A Clockwork Orange (1971), decided to complete the film for him.Written by Spielberg based on Kubrick's early material and vision, Artificial Intelligence is at times brilliant and immensely thought-provoking. As a science-fiction film, this is one of the genre's better Hollywood entries. It may have suffered scathing criticisms from people who disliked the extended ending (which I admire and will try to rationalize its importance), but it remains to be a very well-told and identifiable story that has its roots in Pinocchio and realist fantasy.The story tells of a robot boy called David (Haley Joel Osment) who is brought home by a loving couple to ""replace"" their comatose son, Martin, who would never wake. Set in the distant future, the creation of ""David"", a mechanical human-like companion who is programmed to love, turns self-aware and seeks to become a real human after the miraculous recovery of Martin leads to a competition for love from Monica (Frances O'Connor), their mother. Because of a series of misunderstandings, David is left to survive on his own outside the comfort of home together with Teddy, a talking toy bear who can think.For most parts, Artificial Intelligence is a film chronicling the journey of one persevering robot as he attempts to find his ""Blue Fairy"" who he hopes would turn him into a human so that he could return to Monica and be loved again. The existentialist nature of Spielberg's film allows viewers to question the idea of human consciousness. What makes us humanly real? Is it because we can differentiate truth from falsehood? Or is it because we are living flesh and blood? By similar extension, what makes a Mecha humanlike? Is it because they look human? Or is it because of their capability for reciprocal compassion and love? Spielberg's direction is mostly assured, and with Janusz Kaminski (Schindler's List, 1993; Saving Private Ryan, 1998) photographing the film, expect a visual feast for the eyes. The use of visual effects, which is nominated for an Oscar here, while unabashedly cool, retains a measure of hypnotic allure. There are moments in the film in which only Spielberg could have conjured up. For instance, the shot of Teddy's silhouette against a huge, bright moon, which references E.T.: The Extra-Terrestrial (1982).In addition, the heavily-criticized final thirty minutes features some impressive visuals, with one particular moment evidently a homage to Kubrick's 2001 – that of a box-like vehicle floating across a desolate icy landscape. Speaking of which, it is with an acute sense of irony to note that the final act was what Kubrick had actually envisioned – the idea of moving thousands of years into the future – faithfully and boldly recreated by Spielberg but unfortunately thought of as overindulging in Hollywood sentimentality.In my view, I feel that the final act is very important as it gives the film the closure that it needs – a measured, subtle, (and even meandering) philosophical ending that not only tugs at the heartstrings, but offers composer John Williams to finally perform the full main theme in all of its beauty and melancholy, which until then has only been heard in parts. Artificial Intelligence is an engaging science-fiction adventure that melds Kubrick's chilly bleakness with Spielberg's warm touch. But for better or worse, it is the latter's imprint that is more influential here.GRADE: A- (www.filmnomenon.blogspot.com) All rights reserved.",A.I. Artificial Intelligence

If I had one overriding complaint, it would be the pacing of the film (incredibly uneven), which simply serves to remind us that we're sitting in a theater watching a movie, rather than drawing us into a unique world.  Also, there were far too many ""loose end"" plot points... the film was simply too ambitious, and falls embarrassingly short of that ambition.**SPOILERS FOLLOW**Like many reviewers, I too think the film should have ended with David trapped under the ferris wheel in the ice.  That would have been the logical conclusion to the film, and would have made for a much sadder (yet also strangely satisfying) ending.  Although I *did* get that the mechas in the final scenes were actually ""highly advanced mechas"" and not aliens, the ""explanations"" given by the mechas to David (the ""just one day"" thing and all that) didn't work for me -- way too silly and contrived (the ""lock of hair"" thing just made worse).  It did give the movie a 'feel' similar to the ending of 2001, which helped with the ""cheese factor"" a little.In the final analysis, the 'mix' of the two directorial (and storytelling) styles spoils the film... yet it would be untrue to say that I disliked ""A.I.""

Now, in reconsidering the ending, imagine what would happen if Spielberg had *really* succumbed to to the ""fairy tale impulse?""*** Spoilers Below ***After thinking about it, there is no way Spielberg could have left the film with David trapped under the ice.  That isn't in Spielberg's moviemaking heart, it isn't in his soul.  Perhaps Kubrick could have done it, but upon reconsidering that as well, *I don't think he would have*.  It would have been much to abrupt an ending for Kubrick as well, who likes to draw things out (unreasonably at times) in his films.So -- imagine the ""Spielbergian"" alternative: David prays to the Blue Fairy underwater.  The strength of his wish causes the Blue Fairy to come to life, and she grants his wish.  He turns into a real boy, goes back and finds his mother, and lives happily ever after.Now, despite all the complaints as to the way ""A.I."" ended, would you honestly have preferred the above?  Blecccch!  Upon reconsidering, the ending of ""A.I."" is much better than at first glance.  Where else could Spielberg have taken this material?David never *does* get his wish to become a real boy.  Nor is the ending of the film ""happy"" or ""Spielbergian"" by any stretch of the imagination! Think about it again.  It very much resembles the ending of ""2001, A Space Odyssey.""  In reading David's programming, the ""advanced Mechas"" learn the meaning of love, thus evolving -- very similar to the evolution of man in ""2001.""  Remember how the advanced mechas ""linked up"" upon reading David's programming, and how they kept asserting how unique he was?So upon reconsidering, the ending was actually much more subtle than first impressions would give... VERY ""Kubrickian.""  I would have liked to see the advanced Mechas at the end look less like the traditional conception of ""aliens"" (thus producing less confusion in the audience) -- and that's my sole remaining complaint!This movie stuck with me all day yesterday and part of the day today, and it ""grows on you,"" if you let it.  It is not worth just dismissing as ""crap"" by any stretch of the imagination.  Read between the lines, and see the hidden greatness of the story.  Engage your brain, and compare David's final ""redemption"" to the ""redemption"" of the David in ""2001, A Space Odyssey.""Kubrick rolling in his grave?  Not a chance!",A.I. Artificial Intelligence

152,tributarystu,Acceptable,7,3 February 2003,"Spielberg has always been one of the directors I admired. I liked his movies because they usually were something special, and almost always something good. I'm rather disappointed that I haven't had time to see his so called masterpiece ""Schindler's List"". But I guess all will have their time.
SPOILERS  Artificial Intelligence. Sounds quite intriguing. Robots...those are ""the guys"" we think of when we hear these words. Spielberg asks in this movie a fundamental question: you can make a robot love person, but can you make a person love a robot? The idea is that a company desires to create loving robots. Children robots. In times when it is a privilege to have children of your own, this product can be a solution. An employee gets this robot child, named David, and he and his wife have to ""test"" it and decide afterwards if they want to keep it. Despite being so similar to a child, the robot does continue to show traits of its mechanic part. Spielberg actually suggest to us that we can CREATE love. Can we really? We can hardly love each other, but can we make a machine love, sometime in the near future? Even in the next century? I think not. Still, the idea is interesting to follow. At one moment, the actual child of the couple is revived from an illness which was thought to be without healing. Once the actual child returns back home, we have a new problem. The parents accept to continue keeping David, but of course he goes on the second plan now. As he offers love, he desires love. All he wants is to be loved. Specifically by his mother. If we look at the matter from this point of view we see that actually only the mother did care for him. One made the other feel better. That was good.Unfortunately several unhappy events take place and David ends up to be left alone in a crude world. In a world where he does though have an advantage, because he is unique. He knows that. His human part desires to seek out his dreams and so David tries to find the Blue Fairy, from the wonderful story of Pinocchio. His fight is hard to endure, but in a way the movie does end well.Once he sees that he is not unique, he feels rage. I mean FEELS rage. Feelings. Like love, as I said above. Will that ever be possible? A question to which only science knows the answers. An interesting thing is the kind of ""junk yard"" for robots. A place where robots are destroyed, to the pleasure of the people who come to view those things. Once David is brought on the scene, people are initially slightly confused. Then, they believe that David is really a child and being protesting against his murder. So we have two different traits of the human race in one scene. First the terrible desire for brutal entertainment. Second...the people gathered at that place are human and despite giving us the idea that they really are brutal, by their decision to let the child go free, we get the confirmation that they are people. I just didn't feel that those robots were robots...they were too real for it. I would not have been able to sit and throw objects at things which look similar to God's dearest creation. So I saw it all, initially, as being totally inhuman.The movie is certainly interesting and does ask us some good questions. The special effects are admirable and the actors are just great. Especially Osment, who made me feel what he was, and who acted flawlessly and very believable. Jude Law was as good as he usually, but nothing above or to remember. He got quite well in his character, so I've got nothing to complain about.The one thing that bothered me though was the way the film was actually extended by Spielberg. The end should've been before the aliens. Of course, he brings us a new idea about aliens and when I say this I think of how friendly they were...how human. It is a less suggestive end than it would've been if the movie had ended when it should have. In this way the viewer should be pleased by the fact that David succeeds in a way to finally achieve his dream. I consider this was all unneeded film time. Certainly not needed.Looking at the whole movie, I consider it is one which should draw your attention. It's worth spending some hours in front of the TV for it.Draw your own conclusions afterwards. I would rate it an 8 out of 10.",A.I. Artificial Intelligence

The film covers the story of a couple whose son is in a coma and are looking for an answer. They are given a robotic boy to replace the old son, but when the old son comes back to consciousness, the robot boy begins to develop feelings and wishes to become a human as well.I had high hopes for this film, but I was gloriously disappointed by it. The film is an awkward mixture of Spielberg's humanism and Kubrick's signature dehumanism. These two are both present in the film, which throws the whole thing off-balance. Spielberg had complete control, but he used the film not only as his own work of individual art, but also as a homage to Kubrick. The two do not fit together as well.There is a lot of beautiful and effective moments, moments of hair-raising suspense, moments of creativity, moments of beautiful passages about childhood innocence. These passages are so winning, that the film almost seems excellent and on the level of both Spielberg and Kubrick's greatest masterpieces, but when we look at how uneven and how splintered in indecision the film is, we can barely see these positive qualities.",A.I.

Although this was not unexpected, i guess a lot of people are brainwashed well and hence it says a lot more about the audience than it does about this erhm...erhm...anyone got a good name for this milestone from Dreamworks? Good grief, this was to the mind as screeching chalk is to the ears of a person with a serious migraine.All that this yardsale of pointlessness really does is to disguise itself as a piece of art. That is its sole incentive. And because art is untouchable, it gets away with it too; at least for a lot of people, flabbergastingly getting a 6.8 rating. But then again, what couldn't pass as art..Yet, there was as much art in this brain-shank as in the turd of the performance artist who is threatening his audience he is going to eat it.To list all the factors which made this movie the intellectual insult that it obviously is, is just plainly insane. Just because a well known director and a lot of money was involved in the construction of it, doesn't mean anyone should go out of his way to sum it all up. And besides, it would take days....No, in fact I challenge anyone to see this with the knowledge that once you've reached the point that you are about to get religious to pray for this movie to go somewhere (or simply end), it will only dig harder through the bottom it hit right after the first few lines of script have been muttered.

The child is given to the parents of a child who is dying and their only instructions is that once they show the kid love and program him to love them, that he will never love another family and must be destroyed, if they give him up. The woman starts to fall for the kid even though he is strange and needy and has qualities that are very unlike any of human nature. Suddenly the families real Child, Martin, gets well and he is jealous of the ""robot"" and taunts him into scaring the parents. The mother doesn't like the idea of it, but she fears the life of her family so she takes the child out to the woods and leaves him to fend for himself, and can't bare the thought of him being destroyed. The child soon finds out that mechas, as they are called, aren't looked upon too kindly in the real world. He meets up with an A.I. that was created for sexual pleasures and the man becomes his protector of sorts. The little boys only wish is to become a real boy so his mother will love him and he knows of the story of Pinocchio and looks hard to find the blue fairy that will help him become real, not aware that she isn't real, but his journey becomes one of the greatest stories of love I have ever seen on film.This movie has been in my collection for many years and I had no desire to watch it. I thought it would be Sci-fi garbage and I was wrong by miles. This movie made me cry it was so powerful. The big picture here is about love. They created a machine in hopes it would love, and it turns out it has a stronger love than most humans could dream of.The editing was great. Spielberg's direction was good, the music was good and the production and effects was top notch. Kubrick had held onto this for a long time and I am glad he finally turned it over.I normally don't care for the kid actors and had not liked Haley Joel Osment before, but this movie made me change my opinion on him and thought he did a great job. I was happy with all of the casting, William Hurt, Jude Law, Brendan Gleeson, Jake Thomas, Robin Williams, Jack Angel, Meryl Streep, Ben Kingsley, and Chris Rock all deserve nods...I also love Ministry and glad they were on this movie.The movie was a surprise to me, it does have some slow parts, but for the most part it's entertaining from beginning to end.

158,rparham,You won't need A.I. to enjoy this film,8,25 October 2006,"In the summer of 2001, a filmic collaboration that was beyond immense arrived on theater screens the world over, and it was titled A.I.: Artificial Intelligence. Directed and written by Steven Spielberg, it was a project he inherited from the late, great Stanley Kubrick, who had been toying with it for, reportedly, nearly two decades before his death. Spielberg picked up the torch of the project and managed to do what eluded Kubrick: Actually make the movie. Upon first viewing in 2001, I was very impressed by A.I., and recently seeing it again, I still think it is an underrated piece in Spielberg's canon, but not without flaws. When A.I. works, it works marvelously, but occasionally gets a bit bogged down.A.I. opens in some future setting, when the polar ice caps have melted and the coastal cities of the world have been engulfed by water. The human society has begun to rely on robots, known in society as ""Meccha"" for many tasks, and now Professor Hobby (William Hurt), the head of Cybertronics, has devised the next step in Meccha evolution: to create a child robot that can love. He finds the perfect test case: a father, Henry (Sam Robards) and mother, Monica (Frances O'Connor) whose son has been placed in cryogenic stasis to prevent a disease and the doctor's are uncertain if he will ever recover. Henry is employed by Cybertronics, so Professor Hobby arranges for him to bring home David (Haley Joel Osment), the robot child. David is at first met with resistance from Monica, who is offended that they are expected to let David ""replace"" their child, but she begins warming to him shortly. She eventually ""imprints"" David to her, but when their own child recovers and is brought back into the house, David, who is having difficulty acclimating himself to life with real people, is viewed as a threat by Henry and he eventually convinces Monica that he must be returned to Cybertronics to be destroyed.Monica is unable to go through with it, though, and she leaves David and a walking, talking stuffed bear companion, Teddy, alone in the forest. David is desperate to be reunited with Monica, but finds himself captured by humans who torture robots for sport at what is known as a ""Flesh Fair."" There David bonds with Gigolo Joe (Jude Law) a robot who is designed to be a sexual companion to women, and the two seek out help for David to find a way to be human so that Monica will love him. There are a lot of interesting themes in A.I., including the idea that even with a human face, man will still treat machines as machines, even when their programming brings them enormously close to sentience; a mediation on the nature of love, and the question of when a machine has a soul or not. Many of these issues revolve around David, the focal point of the film, who finds himself trapped with emotions for Monica but is separated for reasons that he cannot completely understand. Gigolo Joe thinks of love merely as sexual acts, but David's love goes deeper, and he is desperate to have it fulfilled. The film's early scenes, with David and Monica together in the household and becoming used to each other, are good, and the late section of the film, as David reaches the end of his journey, are also strong, but the middle section is where the film loses some steam. The scenes in the flesh fair and at the visually stunning Rouge City, where David and Joe go searching information, are momentum killing and introduce a lot of ideas that don't really get resolved. Spielberg is trying to say everything he can on these issues, but by distracting from the core of the story, the narrative gets a little lost and A.I. can prove a bit tedious in those moments. There has been a great deal of criticism leveled at the film's final thirty or so minutes, but these work for me. Many have accused the film of becoming too cute and sweet, but it is the emotional payoff for the earlier part of the film that is hardly the completely happy ending that it has been identified as. It isn't as harsh as it would have been if the film had ended a bit earlier, but it's hardly a panacea, and works just fine.A.I. does excel in many areas, including its look and visual effects. The film is a bit more ""futuristic"" looking than the film that Spielberg would follow it with, Minority Report, but it is still credible. The visual effects creating the future environments are top notch, with immense realism. A.I. also boasts strong performances from its leads, especially Osment. He was impressive in The Sixth Sense, but here he takes the cake and it's unfortunate that he seems to have put his acting career on hold to seek out other areas of interest. Frances O'Connor is equally impressive as Monica. Jude Law is good also, but doesn't have a lot to do, unfortunately.A.I. is an example of a film that reaches for greatness, falls a little short by having too grand a vision, but still manages to be engaging nonetheless. It is one of the more unique films from Steven Spielberg and worth a look.",A.I. Artificial Intelligence
159,dakjets,Artificial love,10,16 January 2016,"This film is both touching and disturbing at the same time. However, very gripping and a film that is difficult to ignore. The couple Swinton has a son who is in a coma. They lose eventually hope that the boy may come to consciousness again, and say yes to accept David, the robot which researchers hope can reduce the loss for childless couples. The couple tries to love robot David, but can not provide unconditional love. When the couple son Martin wakes up of a coma, it becomes even more clear: David does not fit in, and he has to go. The mother takes a drastic decision that leads David out on a dangerous journey. He has only one desire: to be a real human a mom can love. I think this film is masterpiece and understands well that the genius Stanley Kubrick wanted to make a film of this story. Kubrick died before the film was made,but Steven Spielberg ensured that it was made masterfully, and I in Kubricks spirit. This is a movie about hope and the desire to be loved for who we are.

I won't go into all the facts, plots, and all that but Haley Joe Osment is one of the best child actors I have ever seen.  Let's hope that he keeps his nose clean and does not get too underground and mentally messed up like the child actors/actresses in the past.  Keep it up.  The caracters were just awsome each and every one of them.  This movie let's you think about how you should treat your fellow human beings with respect and love and not to just waste human life that everybody is just as important.  You have to watch it to believe how great this film is.  It has alot of Spielburg's past movie influences such as ""E.T"".  I loved the part about the future with the cool looking ice people and all the special effects of what NYC ""may"" look like in the furture if we don't be careful it may be destroyed and look like that as well as the rest of the cities.

I agree with some that the ending is too drawn out, but the final sentence still rings a very ironic bell, if you think about it... and some of the images of the future are tremendously powerful. The plot has its share of weaknesses, but visually the film is a pure triumph. Many scenes are exciting and unpredictable, although the part with dr. Know went on too long. I could probably name seven or eight other main flaws, but I won't, because the film is a masterpiece of imagination and special effects. Perhaps the story itself isn't Oscar-worthy nor is the screenplay masterpiece material, but I was so impressed by the film in some of its sequences that I forgot about any problems I had with the story.

162,Indy-52,an extraordinary visual achievement at the very least (LARGE SPOILERS CONTAINED!),8,9 October 2001,"I must admit first of all that this film will linger in my mind for a long while, not for the story, but simply for the extraordinary visual feast it is. People who thought BLADE RUNNER was mesmerizing will definitely sink their teeth into what this film has to offer visually. Those sleazy future towns, the cars, the tunnel in the shape of an open mouth, Manhattan half-submerged by water... beautiful, memorable stuff indeed. This is perhaps the most convincing and haunting portrayal of the future I've ever seen. But since the film is such an incredible mix of different moods, tones, mentalities, and storytelling styles, it was almost inevitable there wasn't going to be any flaws. It is far from a total mess, but parts of the film obviously don't work well. The narration, much like BLADE RUNNER, was not needed, and I suspect that in the future Spielberg will re-release the film without it. The sequence with dr. Know was technically well done, but it went on way too long. And I didn't really know what to make of the Gigolo Joe character in the film. What purpose does he really serve? It would've been more exciting if David had found the Blue Fairy at the end with the help of a lot of different people. Also the ending itself has been much discussed here. Although I was enchanted by that moment where the story jumps 2000 years into the future, that moment where he reunites with his mom doesn't work well at all. We really don't know if we should care about that character. She hasn't been well developed and didn't come across as a very likable character in the first act. I understand that for the story to make sense David had to meet his mother at the end, but Spielberg should've handled this character much better. The ending didn't, fortunately, ruin the whole film for me, but it was a considerable letdown. And yet there is so much else to admire in the film that I don't hesitate to recommend it to anyone and give it a high rating. A lot of scenes in the film work marvelously well and some really aroused a sense of wonderment in me. I loved an early scene where David meets and compares himself to a group of real kids his age. This was very well done, honest and completely believable. A.I., overall, is a very uneven film that doesn't always work, but it always maintains your interest. It has already been called a flawed masterpiece, and I agree. A film with a lot of ideas, a lot of different tones and moods, and, for all its flaws, never less than mesmerizing.",A.I.

163,Indy-52,flawed masterwork,8,28 October 2001,"Steven Spielberg's A.I. ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE is one of the most thought-provoking, visually stunning films to come along in a really long time, perhaps even since Stanley Kubrick's 2001: A SPACE ODYSSEY (one of my favorite films -- this one often reminded me of it). This is very high praise, I know, but the film is a remarkable achievement in imaginative filmmaking. I haven't seen this many incredible visuals since STAR WARS I: THE PHANTOM MENACE, but the amazing thing is that the film is also consistently involving, absorbing, powerful, and fascinating. Spielberg's film, in its own unusual and unique manner, definitely lives up to the expectations -- and it exceeded mine.What made me skeptical in those expectations was that the man who made E.T. was going to take over a project from the man who made A CLOCKWORK ORANGE. I was afraid that Spielberg would turn Kubrick's icy intellect and brilliant cinematic technique into something shallow and tear-jerking. The surprise is that Spielberg puts his own personality only into the final 20 minutes which represent the film's third act. The rest really looks and feels like something Kubrick could have made with a 90 million dollar budget. The film has some truly awesome special effects. Sequences showing cities of the future, all kinds of robots, cities we know like Manhattan half-submerged in water will have your jaw dropped in amazement and wondering how they got it all on screen. It has the most astonishing effects ever seen even in a Spielberg film, and that's not saying little. But not only did he direct this film, he also was responsible for the carefully written screenplay. It's his first writing credit since 1982's POLTERGEIST, and he has written only one of his movies, which is 1977's CLOSE ENCOUNTERS OF THE THIRD KIND.
In the film's first act we see the life of a robotic, or 'mecha', child called David, played very well by Haley Joel Osment. He is adopted by a mother (Frances O'Connor) and father (Sam Robards) whose child's survival is very uncertain, and he's cryogenically frozen. Initially David seems to be having a good time with these people. He has some weird attitudes, to be sure, but most of the time he seems to be acting like a real kid. Osment's performance is intelligent in the way that he doesn't give his character a typically robotic voice or attitude, but acts and reacts sort of mechanically to his surroundings. It's a unique and intelligent performance that blends the attitude of a real boy and a cold machine. I'm not sure if the Academy will see the goodness of this performance. Perhaps the scene where he shines brightest is the one where his mother, played by Frances O'Connor, leaves him in a forest to fend for his own; once he realises it, his immediate reaction is played to perfection by Osment. He bursts out in tears, and yet the little genius still manages to give hints that his character's emotions are not real, not human anyway.After this heart-wrenching scene the  movie radically changes tone. The film's first 40 minutes or so are rather slow, shot with a blanket of haze by Oscar-winner Janusz Kaminski (who has photographed every Spielberg film since SCHINDLER'S LIST), played subtly and delicately, but after that the look and pace of the film become crisper as it assaults our senses with some big, confusing, fast action sequences as David is captured by a weird character, played briefly by Brendan Gleeson, who travels around the land in a balloon in the form of a huge moon in search of lost mechas so he can take them to his 'Flesh Fair', an ugly festival where all sorts of robots are tortured and killed as entertainment. David manages to win the audience's sympathy and escape certain death (or is it just destruction?). He makes a valuable friend at the Fairs, a 'love mecha' named Gigolo Joe, played by Jude Law, with whom he will leave the Fairs and set out for Rouge City, a sleazy, glitzy, light-filled place with every kind of woman you could wish for, as Joe puts it. David wishes to find the Blue Fairy, since he's been listening carefully to the Pinocchio tale his mother told him and thinks that if he'll find the blue fairy she'll turn him into a real boy. Once they're in Rouge City they go and see a sort of digital Albert Einstein, a computer that answers every of your questions with an animated character called dr. Know, voiced by Robin Williams. This sequence is technically mervelous, but largely wears out its welcome. He's amusing to watch for a while but gets tiresome after a while, although he is important to the plot's development because he leads the two to Manhattan, which as I've said is shown almost completely submerged by water, and deserted, in this film. The effects in this sequence are incredible and scary in a way as well; to give you an idea, we only barely see the head of the Statue of Liberty and it all looks completely credible. I will not spoil the movie more for you by revealing what happens once David and Joe arrive there. Suffice it to say, the movie gets consistently weirder and more intriguing as it goes along after that point. In that way in reminded of 2001, as it takes the main character's journey to a climax in a place he doesn't know, but is shaped into something familiar to him (like Dave Bowman in the weird hotel room) by unknowns to make him comfortable.Many critics around me were disappointed by that ending, and although I must admit that I found the final 5 minutes a bit forced and sentimental, I was still enchanted, all the time wondering what would happen next. For those reading who have seen the film, you must agree with me it's the only way this film could've ended. It also raises arguments for discussion; for example, how can we be sure that a robot can't have real feelings? When a mechanical 'being' has such a burning desire for anything, in this case to find his 'mother', can we just coldly say that it can't be genuine emotion? What makes us more real than robots? We are also made out of organs, atoms, molecules, biological cells. We also react more or less logically to our surroundings, don't we? So do robots.In this unusually long review for me, I still have just scratched the surface of this film's richness, depth, and power. Its flaws and partly unsatisfactory conclusion keep me from giving it my highest rating. It is definitely a 'flawed masterpiece' if there ever was one. After I came out of the theater I was thinking so many different things, not being sure if I had seen a great film, thinking about the parts I loved, about the flaws, about those last 20 minutes... imperfect as I felt it was, I couldn't put it out of my head. That's definitely a higher compliment than you can give to most other movies. I think I could go on for a lot longer, but I will stop right now and tell you that if you like Kubrick movies, if you like to think about movies, this film won't disappoint you.",A.I.

This is very high praise, I know, but the film is a remarkable achievement in imaginative filmmaking. I haven't seen this many incredible visuals since STAR WARS EPISODE I: THE PHANTOM MENACE, but the amazing thing is that the film is also consistently involving, absorbing, powerful, and fascinating. Spielberg's film, in its own unusual and unique manner, definitely lives up to the expectations -- and it exceeded mine.What made me skeptical in those expectations was that the man who made E.T. was going to take over a project from the man who made A CLOCKWORK ORANGE. I was afraid that Spielberg would turn Kubrick's icy intellect and brilliant cinematic technique into something shallow and tear-jerking. The surprise is that Spielberg puts his own personality only into the final 20 minutes which represent the film's third act. The rest really looks and feels like something Kubrick could have made with a 90 million dollar budget. The film has some truly incredible special effects. Sequences showing cities of the future, all kinds of robots, cities we know like Manhattan half-submerged in water will have your jaw dropped in amazement and wondering how they got it all on screen. It has the most astonishing effects ever seen even in a Spielberg film, and that's not saying little. But not only did he direct this film, he also was responsible for the carefully written screenplay. It's his first writing credit since 1982's POLTERGEIST, and he has written only one of his movies, which is 1977's CLOSE ENCOUNTERS OF THE THIRD KIND.
In the film's first act we see the life of a robotic, or 'mecha', child called David, played very well by Haley Joel Osment. He is adopted by a mother (Frances O'Connor) and father (Sam Robards) whose child's survival is very uncertain, and he's cryogenically frozen. Initially David seems to be having a good time with these people. He has some weird attitudes, to be sure, but most of the time he seems to be acting like a real kid. Osment's performance is intelligent in the way that he doesn't give his character a typically robotic voice or attitude, but acts and reacts sort of mechanically to his surroundings. It's a unique and intelligent performance that blends the attitude of a real boy and a cold machine. I'm not sure if the Academy will see the goodness of this performance. Perhaps the scene where he shines brightest is the one where his mother, played by Frances O'Connor, leaves him in a forest to fend for his own; once he realises it, his immediate reaction is played to perfection by Osment. He bursts out in tears, and yet the little genius still manages to give hints that his character's emotions are not real, not human anyway.After this heart-wrenching scene the  movie radically changes tone. The film's first 40 minutes or so are rather slow, shot with a blanket of haze by Oscar-winner Janusz Kaminski (who has photographed every Spielberg film since SCHINDLER'S LIST), played subtly and delicately, but after that the look and pace of the film become crisper as it assaults our senses with some big, confusing, fast action sequences as David is captured by a weird character, played briefly by Brendan Gleeson, who travels above the land in a balloon in the form of a huge moon in search of lost mechas so he can take them to his 'Flesh Fair', an ugly festival where all sorts of robots are tortured and killed as entertainment. David manages to win the audience's sympathy and escape certain death (or is it just destruction?). He makes a valuable friend at the Fairs, a 'love mecha' named Gigolo Joe, played by Jude Law, with whom he will leave the Fairs and set out for Rouge City, a sleazy, glitzy, light-filled place with every kind of woman you could wish for, as Joe puts it. David wishes to find the Blue Fairy, since he's been listening carefully to the Pinocchio tale his mother told him and thinks that if he'll find the blue fairy she'll turn him into a real boy. Once they're in Rouge City they go and see a sort of digital Albert Einstein, a computer that answers every of your questions with an animated character called dr. Know, voiced by Robin Williams. This sequence is technically mervelous, but largely wears out its welcome. He's amusing to watch for a while but gets tiresome after a while, although he is important to the plot's development because he leads the two to Manhattan, which as I've said is shown almost completely submerged by water, and deserted, in this film. The effects in this sequence are incredible and scary in a way as well; to give you an idea, we only barely see the head of the Statue of Liberty and it all looks completely credible. I will not spoil the movie more for you by revealing what happens once David and Joe arrive there. Suffice it to say, the movie gets consistently weirder and more intriguing as it goes along after that point. In that way in reminded of 2001, as it takes the main character's journey to a climax in a place he doesn't know, but is shaped into something familiar to him (like Dave Bowman in the weird hotel room) by unknowns to make him comfortable.Many critics around me were disappointed by that ending, and although I must admit that I found the final 5 minutes a bit forced and sentimental, I was still enchanted, all the time wondering what would happen next. For those reading who have seen the film, you must agree with me it's the only way this film could've ended. It also raises arguments for discussion; for example, how can we be sure that a robot can't have real feelings? When a mechanical 'being' has such a burning desire for anything, in this case to find his 'mother', can we just coldly say that it can't be genuine emotion? What makes us more real than robots? We are also made out of organs, atoms, molecules, biological cells. We also react more or less logically to our surroundings, don't we? So do robots.In this unusually long review for me, I still have just scratched the surface of this film's richness, depth, and power. Its flaws and partly unsatisfactory conclusion keep me from giving it my highest rating. It is definitely a 'flawed masterpiece' if there ever was one. After I came out of the theater I was thinking so many different things, not being sure if I had seen a great film, thinking about the parts I loved, about the flaws, about those last 20 minutes... imperfect as I felt it was, I couldn't put it out of my head. That's definitely a higher compliment than you can give to most other movies. I think I could go on for a lot longer, but I will stop right now and tell you that if you like Kubrick movies, if you like to think about movies, this film won't disappoint you.",A.I.

165,Indy-52,a review by Danilo Pochini:,8,26 November 2001,"Can anyone really be blamed of holding high expectations for a film that joins together two of the most famous, influential, and utterly different filmmakers of the last 40 years? Almost everyone knows the story: A.I. ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE was a dream-on-the-shelf project for Stanley Kubrick, who waited many years for the technology to be perfect for his super-ambitious project (some rumors say he ran into the Brian Aldiss short story in the 60's), and planned to finally make the film after 1999's EYES WIDE SHUT. For the first time, though, Kubrick was going to produce and not direct a movie -- Steven Spielberg was going to take that job, since Kubrick thought he wouldn't be able to convey to emotion required by the story, and Spielberg would. Now, two years after Kubrick's death, Spielberg has written, produced, and directed the film that his dead mentor/friend had dreamed of making for decades. Expectations are tremendous for this film. Would Spielberg be able to make a film worthy of Kubrick's mastery? Would it be the film Kubrick would have made?If little else, A.I. ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE is the kind of film that has you confused and dazed after you've seen it. It's presented with so many different styles that you almost don't know what to think of it. It opens with a Ben Kingsley narration telling us the story is set in the future, where cities near the sea are partially drowned. We meet one professor Hobby (William Hurt), who's at a meeting discussing the incredible advances in technology that robots have made, now called 'mechas'. The pinnacle in mecha technology is represented by David (played by Haley Joel Osment), a robot who can have life-like emotions, like sadness and love. David's 'emotions' will be tested as he is adopted by a family whose young son's life is in danger and has been cryogenically frozen until a cure can be found for him. The mother (Frances O'Connor) is initially skeptical and reluctant, but eventually she will look at him as her son. And obviously, David becomes very affectionate of her and seems to show the love only a son can have for his mother. Trouble arises when her real son comes back to the family. He manipulates David and makes him do things to make him look bad to mommy. She will then leave him behind in the forest to fend for himself. After this, the movie turns, practically, into another. David is captured by the owner (Brendan Gleeson) of an event called the Flesh Fairs, where robots are destroyed as entertainment. The images are now thrown fast and furiously at the audience. It is here that David will meet the 'love mecha' Gigolo Joe (a strange role for Jude Law) and begin his journey to find his 'mother'. The audience will get to sink their eyes into wonderful sights like Rouge City, a sleazy, light-filled future town which is like Las Vegas ten times worse, and a Manhattan half-drowned in water.There is a sense of exhilarating discovery in almost every frame of this film. The impact of some of A.I.'s images will remain with me for quite a while; this is the most stunning visualization of the future, I have EVER seen, and thank God the trailers didn't ruin it. This is one of those films that is undeniably great to look at, and it's worth seeing just for that. Not that the film's first, calmer act isn't effective; it's here that Osment really gets to shine in this role, especially in the scene where he's left behind in the woods. He doesn't give his character a typical robotic attitude, but doesn't give in to a kind of little-boy cuteness either; the story's main theme is the mystery of whether robots deserve to be loved and have emotions, and Osment really gives an impression that there's a beating heart of a boy beneath the machine. Law, however, doesn't come off as more than annoying in his character, which is a big mystery in itself. He seems to represent the Jiminy Cricket of the story, which contains several references to the Pinocchio tale (David goes to Rouge City to find the Blue Fairy hoping she will turn him into a real boy), but he seemed like an ineffectual and superfluous character to me.Not that he is so superfluous as to be annoying or a hindrance to the film; I was enchanted and enthralled through every single scene of it, particularly in the much-discussed epilogue to the story, which I won't reveal, and seems to be a typical Spielberg touch. There will be plenty of people hating that ending, simply because it contains sentimentality, but on further thought that ending is the one plausible or logical one, and it isn't as sugar-coated as it seems first-handedly. There's more than meets the eye there. What really keeps A.I. from being the masterpiece that some may be expecting, is that it's more pretentious and less important than it seems to think it is: it doesn't really give us new insights into the way machines work. Ultimately, it's a pretty straightforward story about a robot and his impossible love for a human, but Spielberg drenches the film with murkiness and pretty pointless mystery once David arrives at Manhattan for the film's ending.Some of A.I.'s missteps in its denouement, which also goes on too long, still can't diminish the power that this film has to hypnotise and transport the audience into another world. I haven't been so intrigued and engrossed by a film in quite a while, and for that I'm sure it will turn up as one of the year's better films. You might think I'm going to say that all things considered this film is a disappointment, but it isn't because I actually expected to be disappointed by such a highly-anticipated film, and A.I. always surprised me and never bored me. It is an intelligent film, with moments of pure brilliance and moments of slight miscalculation, and asks a series of intriguing questions. It falls short of being a masterpiece for being uncertain what to do with those ideas. But perhaps it is useless to ask for answers when the questions are so purely philosophical; we should just philosophize for ourselves to find our own. (8/10)",A.I. Artificial Intelligence
166,GeoPierpont,Giggolo Joe Needs New Stereo,2,9 March 2015,"Jude Law was the primary reason for enjoying this film. When he tried to persuade the pitiful older woman that she deserved better and turned on the charm, that old song sounded scratchy and muted. Maybe he needed new hair gloss that cost a fortune and had to ditch the romantic music quality. However, he is the best looking robot to grace the silver screen to date. One Star! No robot GPS?? Perhaps Stanley was unable to think that far ahead or actually did, but getting lost in a scary forest would not allow Flesh Fair catchers being really mean and make me feel bad ala typical Spielberg.Clueless mother at a pool party? You would think the hostess of a special birthday party would be aware of potential alienation of her new son and choice meat for real boys. However, she just looks dazed while all the boys surround the robot, loudly taunt him and HUGE knives are readily available. I guess those cakes of the future have some pretty tough icing to slice.The Flesh Fair was the beginning of the end for my interest in this film. I imagine this was presented for NASCAR fans? Confusing to the plot of: we hate robots and desire improved standards.Alas, cannot even recommend for Jude Law fans or for computer scientists who have ANY experience with AI, expect many chuckles, this is truly dazzling drivel.",A.I. Artificial Intelligence
167,Brogan,Welcome To the Machines.,10,28 June 2001,"After the death of Stanley Kubrick on March of 1999, I was sad to see both the loss of a excellent director and the long planned project of his titled, ""A.I."" that would never be shown.  I first heard about A.I. about ten years ago on a radio talk show when a caller ask the host on what was Stanley Kubrick up to.  Then hearing that Steven Spielberg was going to take over, I felt that Stanley's wife Christina, wanted Spielberg to take over the project since Steven and Stanely were both good friends.  I was then very pleased to hear that Stanley's original intentions were to have Speilberg direct, and Stanley would design and the have the credits read ""A Stanley Kubrick Productions of a Steven Spielberg Film."" Now that time of waiting for about ten years has come, I heard more rumors and anticipation with A.I. than I did with STAR WARS EPISODE I. And viewing A.I. had transported me into another world........... A.I. tells a classic tale of a very human like robot named David (Haley Joel Osment) who is taken in by a grieving couple, Monica and Henry Swinton (Frances O' Connor & Sam Robards) to replace their son, Martin, who is lying in a coma after a terrible accident.  Monica is angry at David and doesn't want anything to replace Martin, especially a machine.  But Henry warns Monica that if they send David back to the factory, he'll be destroyed. Monica has a hard time trying to cope with David, and after a while, Monica begins to accept David as a new son.  When Martin (Jake Thomas) wakes up from his coma, he sees David as a threat to his parents love.  Martin pulls cruel tricks and pranks on David that causes Henry to hate David and Monica worried about the robot.  It isn't until a birthday party accident that Henry orders Monica to take David back to be destroyed.  Monica gets second thoughts about this, she still loves David like a son, but she knows that he's not welcomed back.  So she drops David off in the forrest with his friend/toy Teddy (voiced by Jack Angel).  Monica warns David to stay away from humans and only be with robots.  David is heartbroken by his abondenment from Monica that he thinks that he's not loved because he's a robot.  He feels that if he finds the blue fairy that was talked about in the story Pinocchio, that maybe David could also be a real boy.  Thus begins the journey of David, the search of becoming a real boy.  Along the way he meets a sexual pleasure robot named Gigolo Joe (Jude Law) who is wrongfully accused of one of his female customer's murder. Lord Johnson Johnson (Brenden Gleason) a cruel robot hunter who destroys robots in a arena for entertainment value. And also Professor Hobby (William Hurt) the man who designed the robot to not only make it able to learn, but also to have feelings and love. After this summer crop of bad films and disappointments (PEARL HARBOR, A KNIGHT'S TALE, MUMMY RETURNS, TOMB RAIDER, etc.) Leave it to Steven Spielberg and Stanley Kubrick to make not only the most pleasing film of the summer, but the most enjoyable film of the year.  A.I. is short for Artificial Intelligence, it should be Absoultly Incredible! This was the movie that I was looking forward to the most this year(more than PEARL HARBOR and PLANET OF THE APES) and I am pleased to say that it met more than my expectations which makes it so far my favorite film of this year. What makes this a fantasitc film?  First the acting is very well done.  Haley Joel Osment proves that he is no ordinary child actor, but the Jodie Foster of his generation.  Osment gives another outstanding performance as the robot David.  He can act very much like a robot and a young curious and frighten child.  I am expecting to see Osment get another Oscar nomination for this film.  But I also like to recognize Jude Law and Frances O' Connor for their wonderful protrayl of the sex pleasure robot, and the mother who is depressed to let her newly arrived son released on his own. Then there is the set designs and costumes.  I found out yesterday while watching the documentary STANLEY KUBRICK: A LIFE IN PICTURES that Kubrick designed most of the sets and costumes for A.I. (he had to, he faxed over 500 drawings to Spielberg over the last year's of his life).  The look of A.I. is a very fascinating mixture of A CLOCKWORK ORANGE, BRAZIL, BLADE RUNNER, and WATERWORLD.  With the future not looking bright and cheerful how it is protrayed in BACK TO THE FUTURE 2 and the STAR TREK movies, but dark, devistating, and apocylptic.  The futurisic world of Mechna City where there is holograms displaying entertainment everywhere, to the ruins of Manhattan, where only the tops of the skyscrapers and torch of Lady Liberty stand above water.  Then the costumes of the futurstic look are also great.  The style that Gigolo Joe is wearing to impress the ladies with his looks, to the very scary look of the robot hunters who's outfits look like the characters from TRON. And the story most of all has great meaning to it.  One would figure that it's a typical Spielberg story with as much corn as in the state of Iowa in it.  But it does have a very deep and intellectual meaning behind it.  The tale of a robot who thinks he's a boy that he is willing to do anything to try to become a real boy just to win back the love of his mom, Monica.  Like UNBREAKABLE, it takes a while to digest it, but after digesting it, you would like more of it and begin to really appreciate it. Finally the directing style of Spielberg, where he does familar scenes from both his films and Kubrick's as well.  The popluar ""Monkey See, Monkey Do"" scene from JAWS where Chief Brody makes movements as his son Sean imitates his every move.  The isolation in the forrest in A CLOCKWORK ORANGE is similar to when Monica takes David out to the forrest.  And the horrific scenes in SCHINDLER'S LIST with what the Nazis did to the prisoners also are seen in A.I. with the abuse to what the humans do to destroy the robots, and make a show out of it. The irony is intresting, the most popular film of Stanley Kubrick's is 2001: A SPACE ODYSSEY.  Now that 2001 has arrived, the most entertaining film of 2001 is the film that Kubrick started to create.  Maybe Kubrick was telling us something back in 1968 about what we could expect in the year 2001, not with the story but with the meaning.  That something wonderful was yet to come, and that something is the film, A.I.  It just would have been creepy to see a copy of A.I. sitting on the record shelf next to 2001 in A CLOCKWORK ORANGE, or having one of the female teens ask Alex about the group, Artificial Intelligence.  People have always said that Stanley Kubrick was ahead of our time, and again, after passing away over two years ago, Kubrick is still years ahead of us.  DON'T MISS THIS FANTASTIC FILM!!!! ***** (out of five)",A.I. Artificial Intelligence
168,HelloTexas11,a fascinating near-miss,7,1 December 2007,"Reviews of A.I. inevitably focus on its flaws, but you almost have to give the film a passing grade because of the sheer scope of its ambitions, and the hard questions it asks. In the near future, 'mechas' (life-like robots) are very popular with humans; in fact, they have become so commonplace that they are taken for granted and used for practically everything. Only one type of mecha seems to be missing- one that can actually love its owner. And that is apparently solved by mechas like David, who is brought into a home where two parents are effectively childless since their own, real son lies in a suspended state, awaiting a cure for his incurable disease. Monica, the mother, gradually warms to David but then her real son is miraculously healed and returns home, setting up a conflict between the authentic and the artificial which the latter is bound to lose. Also present is another mecha of sorts, a walking, talking teddy bear named, well, Teddy, who provides a wry though childlike running commentary on things. With her own son back, Monica perhaps begins to feel guilty about ever taking David in as a 'replacement,' so one day she drives the mecha and his teddy bear to a remote spot in the forest and abandons them. The rest of the film concerns David's attempts to find his way back to Monica. Spielberg disputes that he took Stanley Kubrick's dark fable and overly sentimentalized it; in fact, he claims just the opposite, that the darkest scenes in the film are his. But 'sentimental' might be too easy a word anyway. First of all, it's very difficult for one watching to hope David gets his wish. Monica in an unlikeable character and clearly undeserving of David's 'love.' Therefore, the entire second part of the movie feels misguided. We certainly want David to be happy but we also know that is impossible if he returns to Monica, who would certainly abandon him again. On their journey, David and Teddy meet up with Gigolo Joe (Jude Law), a prostitute mecha. There is a bizarre scene at a 'flesh fair,' where mechas are blown up, disfigured, and destroyed in front of cheering crowds (a parody it seems of Nascar, pro wrestling, and July 4). David narrowly escapes being destroyed and soon the three of them make their way to Rouge City, a sort of revved-up futuristic Las Vegas. David becomes convinced that the Blue Fairy (from 'Pinocchio') can show him the way home and determines to find her. This in turn leads them to Manhattan, which like all coastal cities on Earth by this point in time is under water from the ice caps having melted. David and Teddy end up in a submarine-type vehicle under water where the ruins of Coney Island lay. And there is a statue of the Blue Fairy. David makes a wish but the vessel becomes trapped and there he and Teddy sit for 2000 years. By this time, Earth has entered another ice age, and aliens (which are really evolved mechas) discover the two. They recreate Monica for David, but only for one day; the last shot is of Monica falling asleep, David next to her. The 'Pinocchio' connection would have been obvious in any event, but to confront it directly and literally is another bizarre twist in the story. David's adventures in Rouge City and the ending in Manhattan are two of the best scenes; the aliens' ship in particular is marvelously conceived, just disconnected panels that fly away when no longer needed. A.I. poses a lot more questions than it answers, not least of which is, does David really love, or is he just a machine that is programmed to act as though he does? Most viewers will simply accept that he is in fact capable of the emotion, but humans are forever attributing human characteristics and emotions to everything around them, from pets to plants to inanimate objects. The way in which Monica ultimately reacts to David suggests there is a part of her that realizes he cannot, in fact, truly love her. But then again, maybe Spielberg didn't mean that at all. It's one of the reasons A.I. is a disturbingly thought-provoking film, hypnotically seductive and cold-blooded at the same time.",A.I. Artificial Intelligence
169,simon_booth,Hopeless,2,12 March 2002,"You'd think that a collaboration between two of the finest film makers in Hollywood history ought to yield something really special (even if one of the collaborators was dead at the time).  Unfortunately, AI is there to prove you wrong.Hopelessly naive armchair philosophy about what it means to be ""real"" is made even less palatable by the irritating performances of Haley Joel thingy and the actress who played his mother.  The script is average at best, but the special effects are very good.There was potential for a great movie here, but it's attempt at profundity is so watered down & clueless that it derails the whole project.Will probably appeal to people with low IQs, however... especially with it's large doses of Hollywood schmalz.",A.I.

171,GirishGowda,Futuristic Pinnochio Story Told With An Age-Old Warmth,10,28 May 2010,"I am a huge Steven Spielberg fan and I have never seen a Kubrick film. So, I can't compare the two, though there are certain elements in the movie, which definitely Spielberg wouldn't think about putting there in the first place. This is a Kubrick script and he chose Spielberg to direct the movie before he passed away. I am quite sad about that, because if he had been alive and he saw this interpretation of his idea, what would he have thought about it? From the comments of the nay-sayers I assume that the first thing he would change is the PG-13 rating and make it a rated-R. Spielberg thankfully cuts short the opening scene where a robot is made to undress in front of many people. Also, he doesn't explore Gigolo Joe's (Jude Law) back story, if other user comments are to believed, would be quite dark in Kubrick's original story. Spielberg has always been driven by the heart of the story which makes him such an awesome director. I became his huge fan from Jurassic Park 2 which had me cowering in fear for days after I saw the movie (I was a kid then). After watching the film, I have to say I don't understand how anybody could not love this movie. It is not your typical big budget sci-fi blockbuster, but it is one of the best movies which has a coherent plot with big special effects. This is definitely one of Spielberg's greatest movies and has great camera-work, dialogues and an amazing background score. The world he has created in the movie is mesmerizing. Even though it is kind of an apocalyptic world, I liked it very much.In the future, humans have created every kind of robots imaginable, to help them during the crisis. All the glaciers and ice caps have melted and most of the cities in the world are under water. The natural resources are extremely strained and it is a natural choice to involve robots in every field due to their conserving nature. There are two types of robots - the widely distributed normal robots and the 'Mecha' robots which can think for themselves. But, never before has there been a robot which could love - the kind of love between parents and their kids. Prof. Hobby creates such a robot in memory of his own kid, David. David is brought into the Swinton family where, at first, Monica (Frances O'Connor) is extremely nervous around him. The Swinton's kid, Martin (Jake Thomas) is in a coma and could never wake up from his slumber. After some hilarious and heart warming few days with David, Monica activates his sensors which induce him to real love. He begins to understand that she is his mother and he adores her. She, in return, begins to love him.Then, one day, the unimaginable happens - Martin wakes up from his coma and comes back to home. Martin is jealous of David and coerces David to do bad things, which David thought would make his mommy love him more. After a few such incidences, Monica decides to let David go. If she returns him to the robot company, they would destroy him. She loved him, but couldn't keep him as her son. So she leaves him in a forest and tells him that he could come back to her when he becomes a 'real' boy, like Pinnochio. She advises him to stay away from the flesh market and other dangerous places for a 'Mecha'. Along his journey to find the 'Blue Fairy', he meets Gigolo Joe (Jude Law) - a love robot - and he helps David on his journey. The path is filled with perils and how can a robot with metal fibres ever become a real boy. David doesn't understand one thing - he is already more real than any other robot before him.David (Haley Joel Osment-'The Sixth Sense') is a very lovable character, and Haley gives such a heart wrenching performance that I had tears so many times while watching this film. David is a modern Pinnochio - he wants to be real so that his mother can truly love him. Haley Joel Osment is amazing, the robot/human emotion must be amazingly difficult to pull off effectively, but Osment does it with such relative ease to the point where you do believe he is a robot, not that he is just acting as a robot. Haley was one of the best child artists ever. Frances O'Connor's character is torn between her own son and David. She gives a very real performance, which makes one feel for her. Jude Law is perfect as Joe, but what did his story add to the story in the bigger sense? He only showed him the path, but did he have to be a love-robot for that? No, definitely not needed. William Hurt is also perfect as Dr. Hobby. The teddy bear deserves a special mention. The ending is perfect - David could finally go where no other robots had gone before him, he could finally dream. If Spielberg had ended on Kubrick's climax, I would have been utterly dejected about David's end (i would have still liked it though). This ending gave us hope (I know humans are extinct, still hopeful for David), it could happen in the real world too. 2000 years is a long time, but in the end David was truly happy for the first time in his life and I rejoiced in his happiness. Though the visual effects are amazing, it is the story and narrative structure which propels this film to the status of a classic, for me. Even though it has its flaws, I give it a perfect score because AI is a unique movie which has a heart as huge as Mt. Everest :) 10/10",A.I. Artificial Intelligence
172,smellthecult-com-1,The tedium of humanity,3,23 September 2009,"You know the background to this already: Stanley Kubrick started the project, aiming to bring into focus the meaning of being human, as well as studying the consequences of prejudice, even if those being persecuted happen to be android in origin (read Native Americans, India under British rule, Australian aborigines, folks. Take your pick.) Then the selfish swine went and died. Spielberg took charge, and ended the movie instead in one of the most tedious, schmaltzy ways imaginable. I filled two carrier bags with vomit watching this, kids. Over-long and pretty damn dull throughout, this is not a fitting epitaph for the great man",A.I. Artificial Intelligence
173,BadWebDiver,Ponderous metaphysical diatribe,2,15 April 2002,"The film doesn't have anywhere near the personality of SCHINDLER'S LIST, is far more slower and self-conscious than 2001 (if that's possible); and the plot feels like a cross between D.A.R.Y.L. and WATERWORLD - but without any of the vitality of either of those movies. In fact this shows all the sentimentality and non-subtltey of your standard 80s 'social issue of the week' tele-movie.About the only scene with any life in it whatsoever is the Dr Know segment, though that is hardly worth sitting through the entire movie for. Jude Law, William Hurt, Brendan Gleeson and Jake Thomas are mildly diverting. Haley Joel Osment is well cast as a robot (though I wouldn't regard that as a compliment).In fact, the old classic film METROPOLIS provides a far superior idea for storytelling. A.I. would possibly work better if the film didn't constantly thump you over the head every five minutes with the idea that it's based on Pinocchio; I'm sure most intelligent general public viewers could work it out for themselves after the first reference. (Perhaps its only modern professional film critic who can only get the themes of a story if the characters self-consciously spell them out ALL the time!) And I get very worried when you can start timing the sob scenes to within a couple of minutes of each other. Now that is emotional manipulation at the most crassest level.It does contain some interesting look at philosophical and metaphysical ideas for some possible future developments; but as a film this is awful! (And the idiots who thought this would play as a summer blockbuster movie really needs their heads examined).",A.I. Artificial Intelligence

175,ilovedolby,A film of sheer brilliance!,10,10 February 2003,"I have always said that whenever a Steven Spielberg film is released, it's not just a film release, it's an event! A truly brilliant filmmaker, Spielberg has given us such masterpieces as Jaws, Close Encounters of the Third Kind, E.T., The Color Purple, and Schindler's List. He has dazzled us with visual affects, horrified us with the most fearsome creatures in nature, and broken our hearts with sentimental stories that have touched us in indescribable ways. Now, the master filmmaker brings us A.I. Artificial Intelligence. Starring Haley Joel Osment as a robot boy who only wants to become a real boy. His interest in becoming a real boy is to achieve a true love that only a mother can give. Sound familiar? Perhaps the story of Pinocchio comes to mind. A.I. is a futuristic spin on the classic children's tale, Pinocchio. The robot boy that Osment plays is named David. He is chosen as an experimental device for couples who have either lost a child, or who are not able to have children. Entering his new home, his owners decide to keep him. Monica, played by Francis O'Connor quickly falls in love with the David, as he takes the place of her own son who has been in a coma for nearly five years. However, as time goes by, Martin, comes out of his coma and comes home. Feeling jealous of his new robot brother, Martin quickly finds ways to set David up for disaster, as if two young siblings were fighting for the approval of their parents. Monica's husband, Henry, played by Sam Robards, decides to get rid of David due to David's nearly accidentally killing Martin in a swimming pool mishap. Monica makes the difficult journey to set David on his own into the wilderness because if he is returned to the factory that he was manufactured, he will be destroyed. A very heart wrenching scene to watch, David pleads with Monica to go home. But Monica can't risk any more accidental danger that David could bring to Martin. It's up to David, his teddy bear properly named, Teddy, and another Mecha robot that David meets along the way, named Joe, played by Jude Law, to find a way to become a real boy; and in so doing, go home and be truly loved by his human mother, Monica. A.I. proves to be a very poignant film to watch. There are moments in the film that will bring one to tears and challenge the very idea of what love is. Can a person ever truly love a robot that perpetuates a human? A moral question that is asked in the beginning of the film and the answer to the question that comes from the creator of David, Professor Allen Hobby, played by William Hurt is, `In the beginning, didn't God create Adam to love Him?' The idea of filling an emotional void with something non-human is not a new idea. Beyond the concept of ideas for films, people have been doing it for centuries. All the lonely people out there whom without some form of companionship, be it friendship or love, fill a void with something to help them keep their minds off of their loneliness. This isn't the case with everyone; some prefer being alone to having to deal with others all together. But the best example I can draw is that of the character that Tom Hanks played in the recent Robert Zemeckis film, Cast Away. After being stranded on an island with nothing more than washed up packages, Hanks created a friendship with a volleyball, which he named, Winston. Although it proves to be something that audiences laughed at, it also added a sense of heart breaking sadness for the main character and the audience when he lost the volleyball at sea. Watching Hanks cry like a baby is very sad, but what's more, is that the audience can feel that character's pain. As such, the idea of creating some kind of companionship with a non-human possession is not uncommon. Could it be done with robots in the future? I wouldn't be surprised. In fact, the character that Jude Law plays is a gigolo. He is a lover-model and provides sensual pleasure for his female patrons. Who knows how far the idea of artificial intelligence could go if allowed. Whether or not it should be done is a whole other argument. Beyond the technicalities of the science and morality of artificial intelligence, A.I. is one of the most amazing motion pictures that I have ever seen. Based on a short story by Brian Aldiss, the idea for creating a film adaptation first was conceived by Stanley Kubrick. Kubrick and Spielberg toyed with the idea of which director would direct the project. However, after Kubrick's death, Spielberg decided that he would take the directing reigns in honor to the late Stanley Kubrick. When watching A.I., it's easy to notice that the ideas projected are that of Kubrick's. The futuristic world is cold and bleak. A movement has begun against Mecha, or robots. In fact, the film shows scenes of a `Flesh Fair,' in which people delight to watching the destruction of the Mecha robots. But the film is clearly Spielberg's baby. There is so much emotion in this film, from it's obvious love for family and friendship to the films beautiful and poignant score from composer John Williams. The soundtrack also features a beautiful song performed by Lara Fabian and Josh Groban called, `For Always,' which does not appear anywhere in the film. The performances in A.I. are great. And the films ending is one that is bittersweet in every way.I haven't been so emotionally moved by a Spielberg film since E.T., or Close Encounters of the Third Kind. Unfortunately, the Academy Awards chose to deny any real nominations to A.I., beyond that of Best Score, and Best Visual Affects. A.I. really was 2001s Best Picture, although I can't really complain about Ron Howard's film, A Beautiful Mind winning. Nonetheless, A.I. is really under-appreciated for its beauty and greatness that no other film in recent history has matched. I wish I could thank Spielberg for making this film. It proved to be one of those times when going to the movies will not be forgotten. It's moments like those that make watching films all the more worth it. We can learn something about the world around us, and take away a message or a feeling that cannot be matched by anything else. ****",A.I. Artificial Intelligence

Disasterous screenplay, less than impressive cast and a story that just was not meant to be told on the screen. I often wonder if the master, Stanley Kubrick really could have pulled this film off. I don't think so. In fact, that is why he dropped it in Steven Spielberg's lap, a sort of going away joke. And Steve must be red in the face now.",A.I. Artificial Intelligence
178,MF210,The problem is obvious here,8,2 November 2003,"My Rating: *** out of ****. Stanley Kubrick was one of the best directors that ever lived. Steven Spielberg is one of the best directors of today. A.I. is a film that Kubrick wanted to do for a long time but died before able to do it. He was going to be working on the film with Steven Spielberg and when Kubrick died, Spielberg took over. However, though Spielberg does many things right in this film, it still has a split personality. This was a project that interested them both. The problem is that Spielberg makes light entertainment Sci-Fi films like E.T. and Close Encounters of the Third Kind. His films, particularly E.T. have a cute side to them. Not so with Kubrick, whose Sci-Fi film was 2001(Im not sure if Clockwork is a Sci-Fi film), which was much more deep than E.T. and Close Encounters combined. Spielberg's films are enjoyable to the public (well atleast most of them), but Kubrick's films were not always that way. Even his biggest success, The Shining, was not enjoyed by everybody. The first two hours of A.I. border on great. Spielberg captures the perfect tone that Kubrick would have had without copying him. Theres a very emotional scene in the woods that almost had me in tears. The first 120 minutes of A.I. represent great filmmaking and could have possibly been a masterpiece. The problem is in the last 20 minutes of the film. Spielberg was doing the things the way Kubrick wanted without ripping him off, until the ending. You see that scene under the water would have been the ending Kubrick would have wanted. But Spielberg did not fully understand what Kubrick wanted and gave it a ""nice"" ending. These moments drag and you want it to be over.
The flaw cannot be placed on the actors though. Halley Joel Osment does a solid job as David, there actually moments where we think he is human. Jude Law is excellent as Gigolo Joe, he is very charismatic in this role. Feances O'Connor does a nice job in her role. A.I. does well in the technical categories. The Visual Effects are first-rate. The Original Score is haunting in areas. Overall, A.I. is a good movie but with Kubrick it might have been great.",A.I. Artificial Intelligence
179,TuckMN,"I think, therefore I am -- what?",8,3 July 2001,"There is a heck of a lot of movie here  maybe just a little too much.With a runtime of over 2 hours and pacing that is deliberately slow  without being ponderous  some of this film could have been cut.  Or at least tightened up a bit.Based on Brian Adliss' short story `Supertoys Last All Summer Long' this is a dark, bleak film with many extremely disturbing images  in other words: Do not bring your kids to see it.  The `warm and fuzzy' moments are few and far between and the length will have them squirming in their seat and, worse, talking.Essentially a futuristic re-telling of the Pinocchio story, the film combines a bit of `Wizard of Oz' a bit of `E.T.: The Extraterrestrial' and even a bit of the science fiction classic `Metropolis.'The cinematography by Janusz Kaminski was amazing  he has a penchant for photography through transparent surfaces that provides as much information in reflections as in the subject being shot and gives an appropriate other-worldly effect.The Lighting Director was a genius.  The interplay of light and dark was simply brilliant.John Williams does his usual outstanding job of providing a score that adds to the overall thematic push of the film without detracting from what is happening on the screen.Haley Joel Osment, as David Swinton, turns in an uncannily brilliant performance  equal to the job he did in `Sixth Sense.'  He is an outstanding actor now  we can only hope he will continue in the same vein.Jude Law, as Gigolo Joe, was an intriguing character.  A Mecha designed only for pleasure he became more human and humane as he became more involved with the David Swinton character.

While I thought that the acting was fine (Robin Williams' Dr. Know was a fun surprise) many of the character portrayals were disturbing rather than endearing. David's character was creepy and obsessive, and every time that he said, ""Mommy"" I cringed and immediately lost interest. Joe's character was meaningless, and his character arc lacked closure. Jumping quickly from one gorgeous setting to the next, it felt as though each new scene hit the reset button on the characters and emotion from the previous chapter.More than once, I looked at what was left of the runtime because I thought that the film was wrapping up, only to see that there was still 45 minutes, 30 minutes, 20 minutes left.

This is basically a Stanley Kubrick story and there are moments throughout the movie that this is evident. Unfortunately, Spielberg's interpretation is less artistic than a Kubrick movie, but still he didn't let his ego alter the fact that 'A.I.' is a Stanley Kubrick tribute. No one seems to have noticed the chilling reference to '2001', which was Teddy! The calm computer voice that talks to David, is very reminiscent of HAL's voice as he addressed to David Bowman.'A.I.' could easily be ruined by visual effects, if it wasn't for Spielberg. The only director who has the power to create believable visuals in movies, only because he uses CGI when absolutely necessary. A great deal of miniatures and real robots by Stan Winston are employed, creating probably the best visual effects ever appeared in a movie. ILM's contribution is where physical additions stop and a touch of magic has to be added.Finally, John Williams created one of his beast and longest scores for years.

185,saarvardi,"A.I is, in my own honest opinion, Steven Spielberg's best film of the decade (to date)",10,16 July 2007,"A.I is, in my own honest opinion, Steven Spielberg's best film of the decade (to date). The master director crafted a haunting vision of alien invasion in War of the Worlds, a gripping tale of futuristic moral dilemmas in Minority Report; but only in A.I. did he manage to cream all these into one epic tale that included both over the top visual effects, as well as engaging characters and a sentimental story of family and love. Granted, this is still Spielberg and we are dealing with unconventional robot love, but still, I bet he'd rather we all think of it as a 21st century Pinnochio if anything else.A.I. places us sometime in the not-so-distant future, where humans create realistic and highly advanced robots (mechas) to serve them. David (Haley Joel Osmont from The Sixth Sense fame, in his last big role before disappearing into oblivion) is a child-robot, who is designed to give his undivided love to his adopting mother, Monica (Frances O'Connor), who decides, with her husband, to take him into their home after their biological son Martin turns ill. When Martin returns, he decides to get rid of his android brother, whose robotic programming isn't all that fit to deal with sibling rivalry. When an unfortunate sequence of events make David unwillingly hurt the ones he is programmed to love, Monica gets rid of him in one of the most heartbreaking scenes I can remember. But David is determined to win back his mother's love, and since that's what he's programmed to do, he goes out on a quest to find the Blue Fairy, after he learns of her ability to turn him into a real child (and there's Pinnochio again, for those who lost count). David's journey is a destructive one, since it takes him into the darker realms of this alternate future. In this world, humans eliminate obsolete robot in horrific ""flesh fairs"", and even his faithful robot-teddy bear, Teddy (one of the cutest special effects I've ever seen), can't always talk sense into him.Even though the film demonstrates the corruption of human ethics in the future, it portrays David as a pure and gentle spirit, much more human and humane than most of the habitants he encounters on his journey. Jude Law shines in his supporting role as Gigolo Joe, the charming escort robot who, like David, fights for survival while developing emotions he was never supposed to have.I remember watching A.I in theaters shortly after 9/11, and the thing I found most ironic about it was that with all the apocalyptic nature of the film, we still get to see the World Trade Center 200 years in the future; teaching us that sometimes reality can be far harsher than what we may expect even in our darkest dreams. Despite the overlong ending that bothered me in War of the Worlds as well, A.I. is nothing less than an impeccable and disturbing vision of what our future might look like, if we don't wake up fast. It also demonstrates the length a child might go through to win back his mother's love, a worldwide theme anyone can relate to.",A.I. Artificial Intelligence
186,merrywood,"Artificial Intelligence, indeed!",5,6 July 2001,"If Stanley Kubrick was anything at all we know from his filmography that he possessed a discernment of high order.  At the same time Steven Spielberg, although an extraordinary visualizer, albeit the signature overproduction penchant in his projects, the body of his work has been shallow.  It caters primarily to immature audiences of average or below average intelligence, the large and profitable base of moviegoers. Thus, it is fairly difficult to understand a possible collaboration between two filmmakers who operate at different ends of the spectrum.	In this supposed fruit of a long correspondence between the two unlikely filmic partners we see a film, wafer thin in its conception.  While paralleling the immortal Collodi story of a puppet that loved life so much it wanted to be a real boy, the film exhibits none of the genius and depth of the classic tale.	Little, red warning pennants show up early in this film. We are first asked to have compassion for a rather immature mother neurotically obsessed by the death of her son, his body cryogenically sustained.   The illogic of this idea follows through the film.  We are asked to believe that in the distant future in which this film is set, science has yet to come to grips with the blatant fact that the human is not nor cannot be its constantly changing body.         In the meantime, scientists are at work at creating an unchanging, new robot (ostensibly for the childish mother) one that can ""express love"". Herein lies the basic perfidiousness of this film, where its writers, including Spielberg, who wrote the screenplay, apparently have not yet studied the concept of love enough to understand that love is not need, nor is it desire. 	Would we but have literate writers, who at least had read Kahlil Gibran?		""Love gives naught but itself and takes                  naught but from itself. 			Love possesses not nor would it be possessed; 		For love is sufficient unto love.""	For unfounded reasons, mostly the results of Machiavellian manipulations from the resuscitated actual son of the childish mother, a son whom we are supposed to believe can outmaneuver the programmers of the boy robot, the mother abandons the needfully programmed boy robot in a forlorn forest where it begins its journey into hell.

It touches on some very essential questions on the meaning of life, and what constitutes being alive. It does this in a sweeping panorama that begins with a single human family and ends with the future of intelligent life in the universe. It is told almost in a fairy tale fashion, such as Peter Pan, or Alice in Wonderland. In this way, Spielberg sets himself a herculean task: make a great film in the style of another great filmmaker whose style is very different from your own. I believe he mostly succeeds, but not without also putting much of himself in the finished product as well. This is by no means a bad thing. There are many worse amalgamations than Spielberg doing Kubrick. I find this film very attractive for a number of personal reasons, but I think it will also strike a deep chord with many viewers if they are willing to meet it on it's own terms. It is not so much a prophecy of the future as it is a study in how a prophecy of the future can reveal profound universal truths about all times and all experiences. IMHO, it's a masterpiece!",A.I.

190,RIK-22,"Classy look and feel, but poor story.",4,27 March 2002,"Contains spoilers.I recently saw A.I. on DVD.I normally hate Spielberg films, as they are all bland and simplistic, but the first 30 minutes of this film I thought was excellent, well made, some depth and realistic dialog.  Unfortunately from there on the film never really gets going.There's a number of problems with the film, it's too long, I've nothing against long films in general, just films that seem to be long without anything happening.  The main characters being robots and incredibly dumb, I couldn't have any real sympathy for them.  As others had pointed out, strangely the most intelligent robot was Teddy'.  The story didn't really go anywhere and I'm still not exactly sure what the message of the film was. The strange flesh fair', seemed bizarre, why go to all that trouble and expense just to destroy robots, surely people aren't that bothered in watching robots meet their demise.  I'm sure VR would have been pretty sophisticated by that time and I also would have hoped that the human intellect would have progressed slightly.Surely all the robots would have had a device to control or at least find them, when necessary, how David, got lost exactly is a bit strange.  The strangest scene, for me, was when David arrived in NY and found his creator. The creator then announces he's off to get the other scientists, yet disappears.  He is aware that David is special and effectively emotional, yet leaves him in a room full of identical robots.  No attempt is then ever made to find David or the Helicopter, again bizarre, as it was hardly the Titanic.   Then onto the end, what was this ridiculous idea that humans could only live again for one day.  I'm sure if they could create a human being, it could function for a normal lifetime, even if it didn't have the same memories and experiences of the original character, so why not let the relationship develop again.The film certainly has some positives, the camera work, acting and special effect, were all, excellent and it's nice to see someone at least trying to make a profound sci-fi film.  It's just unfortunately the plot wasn't really there and I don't think Spielberg has the ability to handle a project of such depth and grandiose.It just a shame we never got to see the Kubrick version.",A.I.

I did not like the fairytale like moments/parts of the film, as they felt too clichee.

194,robotbling,Pinnochio re-imagined,8,12 December 2011,"(www.plasticpals.com) Is the acronym ""A.I."" really so obscure that they felt they had to spell it out in the title? In any case, Stanley Kubrick's vision for the film, based loosely on Brian Aldiss' ""Supertoys Last All Summer Long"" would never reach the screen. I wonder what kind of movie it would have been had he directed it himself, but I suppose we'll have to make do with Steven Spielberg's take on it. Which is not to say that I dislike the film, or even Spielberg's work in general, though I will hold Jurassic Park 2: The Lost World against him.A.I. is one of the better sci-fi films concerning robots in the past decade. It focuses its lens on David, an extremely realistic robot child played to perfection by Haley Joel Osment, designed for infertile parents yearning for a child of their own. The first act explores the relationships that develop between the robot and his adoptive mother, as well as that with his real life, flesh and blood ""brother"" who unexpectedly returns home from the hospital. The complications that arise from this dynamic are wonderfully illustrated, ramping up to David's heart-breaking abandonment by his ""mother"".Beginning in the 2nd act, David's quest to become a real boy begins in earnest, borrowing unabashedly from the story of Pinocchio. David's desire to become real is however, so much more potent than that of Pinocchio, for it is driven by the longing to be loved by his mother. And it's here that I feel the film loses much of the impact it could have had had it stayed within the domestic setting. As a result of this shift it becomes more of an adventure movie, though it continues to examine the role of robots in the world: as victims in the mock-execution show Flesh Fair, and prostitutes in sinful cityscapes. David's partner through much of the film is expertly portrayed by Jude Law, who's Gigolo Joe seems to possess the innocence (and perhaps the intelligence) of a child.The film has a weird double ending, one where David is frozen under the sea wishing in front of a statue of his elusive Blue Fairy for centuries. Instead of rolling credits, we're taken on one final journey somehow reminiscent of the final episode in 2001: A Space Odyssey. The only remnants of life left in the frozen wasteland that was once New York City are robots so advanced that they appear alien, excavating the ruins of human civilization. Like the domestic setting in act one I feel that this final act could have been more fully explored at the expense of scenes like the Flesh Fair.A.I. is an intelligent and well crafted film, playing to Spielberg's strengths rather than his sometimes stupid sentimentality (as seen in, for example, War of the Worlds' ending). John Williams' score is typically brilliant. I think Kubrick would have been pleased with the final film, and I don't think I can give it a better recommendation than that.",A.I.

""A.I"" challenges the view of spectator, to watch a tale with pure magic. A tale in which there are plenty of symbolisms, pauses to think about the character, a beautiful, creative art direction with genius details.The world Spielberg painted is sad, bright on neon lights and spectacles yet obscure on people's souls. Robots are those that will show how human beings are not understandable, are just a mess, we cannot go past through our hopes and fears, and that's what makes us unique.Human and Robots will learn to like this film as time goes passing by, very slowly.",A.I.

196,gws-2,A Fantastic Film -- in Every Sense,10,30 June 2001,"What a great movie!  The reviewers who have had problems with ""A.I."" seem to have been concerned by the fact that it focuses so much time and emotion on a little boy who is not a little boy but is a robot, a toy. Thus, why should we care about him?  These reviewers got it wrong, it seems to me.  The coda to the film explains that in 2000 years there are no humans left on earth -- I cannot decide whether the creatures who inhabit the earth then and rescue David from the craft beneath the Ferris wheel at Coney Island are organic or are robots themselves.  In any event, they are not human.  What David proves, though, is that even robots can have the indomitability of the human spirit and that earth's new inhabitants can learn from this ability. Rooting for a robot, as Speilberg urges us to do raises disturbing questions.  Although David isn't really a little boy, he projects the emotions of a little boy, even to those who inhabit the earth 2000 years hence.  So by rooting for him as Spielgerg urges us to do, and I did, are we betting on the wrong team?  Or is David ""one of us,"" after all?  It's pretty creepy, even scary to think that David may somehow be human because he possesses the characteristics of humanity but the idea is thought provoking. As I said, it's a great film.  10 out of 10.",A.I. Artificial Intelligence
197,Starbuck-13,"Sometimes nice, mostly boring, in the end embarrassing...",4,19 September 2001,"Oh wow, Spielberg REALLY tried to be Kubrick this time. Don't get me wrong: Kubrick may have been a great director, but his movies never were my cup of tea. So now here we have Steven Spielberg doing a ""Kubrick Light"" version of the A.I. story.The good points first: Haley Joel Osmont and Jude Law are EXCELLENT in their roles, they really kind of save the day.So far, so good...The bad points? The movie is way too long, especially in the end when Spielberg once more in his career does not know when it would be right to END the film... there would have been a good ending with Haley and Teddy trapped under water, but NO, there had to be a continuation which involved everything a prototypically bad Science Fiction movie usually is including, from Techno Babble to Cloning to long, skinny aliens (I know they were no aliens, but they looked that way). Even before this unendurable end, there were many scenes which were plain boring. Some strong moments, especially in the mother-Haley interaction, were cut short in favor of brutal Android destruction mayhem.
All in all, this movies seems like it is made out of at least four Short Films, ""Mommy Daddy Child"", ""Flesh Fair"", ""The hunt for the blue fairy"" and ""Aliens from Inner space talking rubbish"".

Written and Directed by Steven Spielberg, the movie's premise came from him and his long lost friend Stanley Kubrick. Working with is own script, Spielberg writes competently, and directs passionately. The performances are also the high point of the movie with Haley Joel Osment better here than in the Sixth Sense, doing with Frances O'Connor a titan duel. If Spielberg was attempting for tears in the final day sequence, he succeeded, touching the most insensitive viewer, saving the catastrophic and incomprehensible scene before, the alien meeting.

200,jaddison383,"Interesting to watch, but hard to accept...",6,23 May 2007,"Artificial Intelligence is a great example of a filmmaker taking a believing audience for granted. A whole lot of the movie was very far-reaching, and though produced well and real-looking it was still hard to believe and/or grasp sometimes.This is the story of planet Earth after the polar ice caps have melted. Many cities on the edges of continents have been forever lost. In this day and age of failing natural resources, humans have begun to use robots- for just about everything. Robot servants, robot nannies, robot cleaners, and now... robot children. A young couple is given the opportunity to be the first couple to ever own a robot child who can experience love- David. And as the movie goes to show, he loves hard. The real question is though, can a human ever really love a robot back? First of all, let's talk about performances. Haley Joel Osment turns another very nice performance in this film, and he even makes a character go from complete opposite to opposite throughout the film in the audiences mind; at first he is creepy and off, but by the end you love him. The only other real standout for me was Frances O'Connor as the mother torn between her love of her family and her love David, a robot. We see and feel her grief. Jude Law to me just felt like he was playing himself- easy going, womanizing, smooth talker. The other thing to watch for is cameos by several famous actors. I won't tell you just where.The other main performance of the film is the effects. They seem to take on a role themselves. If so, they're probably the best part of the film. Truly, the effects are stunning, even if the move is somewhat less than so.The main problem with AI is that it takes too much for granted. It takes us into a world and expects us to instantly believe all that we see. At times, this works quite well, bringing about elements of surprise and shock. Others, you're shaking your head in disbelief. The ending especially almost killed the movie with it's far-reaching ideas and thoughts. It destroyed a lot of the meaning for me. Not to mention that the film is very heartbreaking. It borders on depressing.However, the movie is still definitely worth watching. If you're a fan of science fiction, then this movie is definitely for you. If you're not a fan of science fiction, then I would suggest one-time viewing. Artificial Intelligence is, at heart, a story of love, and in my opinion, that's what holds the film together. We can all relate to that desperate want of love that David feels. Love is one thing we all want. 6/10 stars.Jay Addison",A.I. Artificial Intelligence

One of the all time best performances of a child actor, I can say anything else. I disliked the ending though. What was the point of damaging the film with that stupid overly happy ending? Before that I could actually have rated it 10. I mean, think of how powerful it would have been if it ended with David being trapped at the bottom of the sea for all time. It would have been a metaphor for something above most of us, but I guess this was Spielbergs work. I still rated it 9/10 because of all that happened before but the ending was seriously poor.I would like to add that I think Spielberg is a great filmmaker, his only problem is that he don't always see the endings that work because he always want them to end with a smile.",A.I.

202,blazesnakes9,A.I. is pure magic,8,4 January 2014,"Science-fiction has been one of my favorite genres ever. Of course, there are a lot of science-fiction movies that I have liked and praised throughout my entire life as a movie-goer. Some of those films includes: The Terminator, Terminator 2: Judgment Day, Total Recall, Blade Runner, Minority Report and Rollerball. But, when I saw A.I. for the very first time, I was thrilled and moved. A.I. Artificial Intelligence is a film that was written and directed by Steven Spielberg. The film tells the story about a young robot child named David (Haley Joel Osment), who is brought into a world where global warming runs amok and a giant megacorporation called ""Mecha"" developed robots for humans. The young David was made by ""Mecha"" by a scientist named Professor Hobby (William Hurt) . A young couple has just received news that their only son, Martin, slipped into a coma. So, the father of the family decides to bring home a robot from the company. The little boy is named David, and in the beginning of the movie and in the beginning of his new life with his new family, David is unknowingly not accepted by his new mother, Monica (Frances O' Connor). She and David can't seem to relate to one another. After Monica receives news that Martin has come out of his coma, the father, Henry (Sam Robards) decides to bring Martin home. But, there's a sibling rivalry between Martin and David. In fact, David is programmed to show unconditional love. But, his human family isn't prepared for the consequences. After David's protection system is activated by one of Martin's friends during a pool party, he hides behind Martin for protection, leading them to fall into a pool. The human family can't seem to understand David's capabilities on what he can do. One day, Monica decides to abandoned David on the side of the road, leaving him and a robot teddy bear named ""Teddy"" (voiced by Jack Angel). Now, all alone and no one to guard him from danger, David decides to ventured out into the open world, where his objective is to find the Blue Fairy that is mentioned in the famous fairy tale, Pinocchio. Later on in the film, David meets another robot named Gigolo Joe (Jude Law). He, too, is also made from ""Mecha"". So, Gigolo Joe and David team up together as they roamed around the open world of technology by trying to find the Blue Fairy that David is obsessed with. His obsession leads him to the bottom of flooded Manhattan, where he encounters a statue that resembled the Blue Fairy. As mentioned above, A.I. was written and directed by Steven Spielberg himself, but another director, Stanley Kubrick, also was in the development of making A.I. back in the 1970's. Kubrick's ideas was to have David be an actual robot instead of a actor. But, Haley Joel Osment is so good as David. He plays David so precisely through emotion and authenticity. The art-direction of this movie is great. I mean, I have never seen a future quite like this. One of my personal favorite scenes is when David and Gigolo Joe get to Rouge City. Rouge City is perhaps the best looking futuristic metropolis since Ridley Scott's Blade Runner. This look of the future is so good-looking and so extraordinary that we are actually living inside this movie. Another thing that was brought up during the movie and even after the movie was the combination behind Kubrick's ideas and Spielberg's original ideas. I believe that both of their ideas worked. You have this robot child that has the ability to love, but the family that he is adopted from doesn't seem to love him. Instead, the family loves Martin, more than they loved David. Yet, robots in this future are the lower existing factor of this world. Spielberg's ideas makes the movie worked, also. The reason why is because it's obvious that in his movies, the young boy or young man questions his appearance, identity, existence and even, his love. This is one of the first of two science-fiction movies that Spielberg was involved in. The following year, he directed Minority Report starring Tom Cruise. What I like in both movies is the vision of the future. It is so optimistic, yet it is not clichéd or predictable in any shape or way or form. A.I. dares us to ask questions about technology. Can we cope with it? Can we reason with it? Can we accept robots as humans? These are questions we can't answer, yet we can see where it leads us. Those questions are just as important as anything that is original. Still, A.I. proves to be a new sci-fi classic from director Steven Spielberg. ★★★ 1/2 3 1/2 stars.",A.I. Artificial Intelligence
203,srmccarthy,"Very long, but worth the watching!",8,25 October 2017,"I have not read all the reviews, so I am not sure if anyone else has mentioned that this movie is very much like the movie D.A.R.Y.L. (an older movie about a robot boy). If you ask me, Stanly was inspired by D.A.R.Y.L, and decided that the story was so good that it had to be re-made better! Good job Stanly, and thanks Steven for finishing this work of art, at the request of Stanly's wife, after Stanly death. Stanly wanted a real robot to play the part of David (as Steven explains in the extras included with the DVD release), but it was just too much to ask for. Haley Joel Osment is the best boy actor, to play the part of David, as Steven makes very clear.

Really, there should be an older woman doing reviews for some of these films.  We have altogether different perspectives.The best character in the film from my POV was darling Teddy, the toy bear. Wise and compassionate and darling.  I was charmed by him and the relationship to the robots.  Haley was amazing as the robot who wants to be a real child.  The mother and father come off as very selfish yuppies, only interested in their own needs.  As with real people today who have disposible pets, they get rid of their robot when he becomes a bother. 
Having never been able to sit through 2001 (it is so boring), I was not expecting anything like it, so was pleasantly surprised that I enjoyed this whole film.

The story is supposed to be science fiction, but the science is sick and the fiction poor. It was clear early on that the story was not going to work. A robot child that can never grow, will always be an ageless small child, is not a child that any family would want.To its credit, the story is not predictable, but it takes too long to develop and it can get boring at times.

206,lingmeister,Spielberg the mecha,6,24 April 2002,"Seems that Spielberg was given a opportunity to fulfill Kubrick's dream. But it was not to be.  Turning on his techniques of sappy sentimental and manipulation of emotions that he has often employed in his childish movies. He made a film that neither showed the dark/cold/sinister side of this Mecha reality or the true emotion that the kid felt while in search for love by his mother.Some scenes seemed too typical, with the bad guys humans in Flesh Fair depicted as typical Spielberg bad guys, and to have the audience stone the announcer in angst over his upcoming tearing apart of a kid mecha, it is so predictably Spielberg.I would assume that a beta project like the deployment of the first mecha with true emotions, the family receiving it would keep in constant contact with the creator for feedback, tweaks and modifications.  But they are nowhere to be found, so it leads from one unfortunate event to another, eventually leading to the point where the mecha kid is a danger to the family, leading to his exile in the forest where mecha hobos roams.Somehow the social message got lost in the fairy tale story telling.  It is as if Spielberg is still making a children's movie like E.T.  With an ending that tells nothing about outcome of the mecha/orga conflict, which was probably the most important subplot of the movie.What was good about the movie was the visual depiction of the future, from the route to and view of Rouge City, and the New York City that is submerged in water with only some skyscrapers protruding out.  Although it is not as visionary as in Metropolis.I thought Blade Runner (directory's cut) was the better movie when it came to the concept of throw-away beings coming to terms with their existence. More visionary, darker, more cynical and no pandering to the emotions.Still, a 6/10.",A.I. Artificial Intelligence

208,rmarkd,Didn't like it...,6,15 June 2002,"SPOILERS WITHIN I didn't care much for A.I. and my summary of the movie will also include what I didn't care for. We first start with an AI-prof and a group of well dressed researchers discussing how to make a boy genuinely love someone and whether that love can be requited by a human. What, this discussion *never* took place before? AI-prof makes such a boy (robotboy) in the image of his own son, but then ships him off to live with another family. This family has a son in a coma and a mother staying at his side for years when everyone else has given up hope. So, the dad thinks it's a great idea to get a robot substitute son and say absolutely nothing about his plan in advance! Robotboy pops up unnoticed, laughs funny, looks at you funny, and yet the mother and robotboy bond. Things go great and then the real son awakens from the coma. This real son is jealous and apparently a sadistic genius as he guilefully tricks robot boy into doing stupid things. (On an aside, there's one scene where robotboy eats vegetables and his face starts to sag. Geez, what crappy quality for a robot *boy*). Anyhoo, robotboy does some inexplicably dumb stuff and the family sees him as a danger. So, they send him back. But, ahh!, if you send him back, he must be destroyed! Well, that can't happen so the mother, sent to take him back (why didn't the father do this as he seemed to be less emotionally attached?) leaves him 20 feet from the compound. ""Son, I can't let you go back there, so I'll leave you alone in the woods with an animate teddy bear."" With robotboy alone, he gets caught by people who hate robots and hate them so much that they torture the robots much to the cheer of an audience. Instead of depicting the backlash hatred humans have for the robots taking over the planet, I saw a group of humans lacking any compassion  even if only towards simulated beings. Anyway, they're about to kill robotboy, but the audience turns because robotboy talks about pinocchio and cries. Okay, maybe this is a way of showing the that kid can get people to truly love him, but this kid is *exactly* what these humans are fighting against. Whatever. Well, robotboy befriends a ken doll robot who cracks his neck to play some old 40's tunes (says something about music in the future). Kendollbot can fake love enough to be a gigolo, hmmmm. Kendollbot and robotboy embark on a journey to find the blue fairy as said in a fairy tale. They go to an Einstein-like holograph and look for an answer to a question from this glorified search engine that amounts to a knock-off google search, but with a nice cartoony response. Goody goody. At no point does this seem ridiculous to kendollbot. VR-Einstein tells them to go to Man-hattan (get it?), where robots fear to go because it has the word man in it. Cops enter the story to arrest kendollbot but stupidly leave their airship totally unattended for robotboy to steal. They head over to Man-hattan in the stolen airship where robotboy finds a copy of himself reading a book. Robotboy gets jealous and knocks off CopyOfRobotBoy's head. Sure, this is the son we all want to have! Anyway, AI-prof. comes in and tells him he's special. They lost him for a while, and apparently this happened when the mother left him 20 feet from the compound. Uhh... GPS, perhaps? Well, they find him again, but want to see how he reacts to the world and whether he can follow a dream. What? Where did this come from? Robotboy followed a story he thought was true. Anyway, robotboy realizes his quest isn't over, dives down and sees a blue fairy. He prays to be human for 2000 years underwater. Spielberg could have ended it here, but he didn't. Instead, after that 2000 years, we are all dead and aliens chill on Earth. The boy is saved and wants his mommy. They can bring her back with the DNA from a lock of her hair stuffed up robobear's ass for the last two millennia, but only for one day and then she's lost forever. How friggin convenient. They have a nice time together, making coffee, playing hide-n-seek, and in the end, she tells him she loves him and the story ends.I like Spielberg, but AI was just a long, boring, convenient movie without making a real point. Robobear is the only bright spot of the movie. 6/10.",A.I. Artificial Intelligence
209,Sinnerman,A Beautiful Failure,8,10 September 2001,"Many people, including myself, left the cinema with a bad aftertaste. Its not that ""A.I. Artificial Intelligence"" was disjointed in its plot developments, feeble in its supposed visionary themes or that it careened itself off the edge with its overly long and OTT maudlin sentimentality. But that it may be all of the above and then some. Which was a pity, as the performance by the cast (from Haley Joe Osment on down) was uniformly outstanding. In addition, the set design and visual effects also seamlessly enhances the reality of the future world for which must have been so painstakingly envisioned by Kubrick and Spielberg over the span of their near two decade creative process.Then there were the themes and ideas touched on, which could have generated a far reaching and much more thought provoking impact, had it not been mishandled by the decision to dilute its darker edges for a more audience pleasing effect.As such, amidst my confusion, I still cannot decide on what to make of ""A.I."". But after having read some of the haughty reviews and user comments posted here, I find it hard to join the lynch mob in condemning ""A.I."" as a failure. A 'Beautiful Failure' perhaps, but definitely not a total one.For starters, one has to acknowledge that, despite its ambition,  A.I. was far too difficult a film for Spielberg or, dare I say, Kubrick himself to essay alone. This, I believe, may be due in part to their shared desire to create a film which would encompass everything they have envisioned on paper into film. This may have blindsided their judgement, thereby unwittingly loading the film with far too many under-developed themes and subsequently tilted the overall balance of the picture.Would the film have worked if its themes and ideas were spread out into a two to three picture saga? Or might this story, which possesses such lofty ideals and expansive scope have perhaps been too mammoth an undertaking for the film medium? Should Spielberg have instead considered using television as a more suitable alternative medium for A.I.(Much like HBO's Mini-series ""Band of Brothers"", which coincidently was produced by Spielberg and Tom Hanks)? Answers to which we may never know.....Nonetheless, in this day and age, when films like ""Pearl Harbor"" constantly insults our intelligence(or lack thereof), I am grateful that Hollywood have greenlighted a project like ""A.I"".Instead of ridiculing its flaws, one should judge ""A.I"". as a admirable effort from Hollywood to break through the veneer of its own assembly line mediocrity and challenge the main stream audience with something worth thinking about. That it is a failure should have been but a footnote in our collective conscience as it bears hope for the greater good of films to come and thus is very much a risk worth taking.",A.I.

""A.I."" was another one of those projects that take years on pre-production. Suffering from production problems since 1970, changing companies and Kubrick laying off several writers that didn't captured his view of the story. Until after the death of Kubrick, and his wife Christiane Kubrick asked longtime friend of her husband, Steven Spielberg to directed the film, and Spielberg ended up making one of his masterpieces.""A.I."" takes place in a future where the glaciers finally melted due to global warming, flooding most of the costs of the countries. The human race continues to move forward, with what is still available from food, technology and with minerals that still exist. And with the advancing years, they start building robots with human appearance and with artificial intelligence, each programmed for a certain function (babysitter, housekeeper, lover). Until Professor Hobby (William Hurt) begins to manufacture children robots with human feelings and emotions, to be sold to families who have always wanted to have children. One day Henry Swinton (Sam Robards) decides to buy a robot named David (Haley Joel Osment) for him and his wife Monica (Frances O'Connor) who suffers from the lack of his son Martin (Jake Thomas) who is in a terrible coma. Over the months Monica creates a great mother's love for David, and David treats her with great love of a son to his mother from admiration and obedience. But everything changes when the son of Henry and Monica wakes up from the come and get back home and start involving David in a lot of confusion. The ""brothers"" relationship gets even complicated when David inadvertently almost drowns Martin in the pool, causing distrust of Henry and Monica thinking that David can be a serious danger to the family. Monica then takes David away from home and expels it in the middle of the road. David suffers and puts the idea in his mind that if he becomes human he can go home, starting a massive journey through the country where robots are enslaved by humans.Kubrick and Spielberg even being longtime friends both had completely different styles of movies. Kubrick had his brilliant scripts giving the story an air of mystery and disturbing moments with a sly touch of humor, followed with excellent filmmaking and perfect photography. Spielberg, always changed the style of his film, he is even today known for changing style film capturing perfectly the different movie tones.Since the beginning of the film, it all looks like Kubrick, like was really him writing and directing. His elements are everywhere: old and scary voice narrating the story (element from Barry Lyndon); disturbing and mysterious narrative with a sly touch of humor. And of course, always criticizing society by every minute. All this thanks to Spielberg's script, the 2nd that he writes since ""Close Encounters"", which in my opinion captures the style of Kubrick's screenplays. And its beautiful direction, even that didn't surpasses Kubrick direction, feeds very well the story, and also giving the film amazing visual effects and incredible CGI.And of course, Spielberg couldn't resist and putting his own elements. Some may see this as a negative, but gives so much to the history. Putting to the disturbing and mysterious story heart, making us relate to David and feel his pain when our future society rejects and him, and makes us care about his search for become a human being. And in the end makes us believe that dreams can come true.We will never know if Kubrick would be happy with the final product, but I like to think that he would. Spielberg with a superb script and fine direction captures the style of Kubrick, with excellent performances by Haley Joel and Jude Law as the robot lover. It all ends in a masterpiece that it didn't captured the deserved respect from critics and the public, which gave us a story that mixes Pinocchio with post apocalypse, with disturbing and emotional moments, a film that in one word is beautiful! 10/10",A.I.

At the end, gosh i dont know what will happen to david, i hope there is some sort of sequel to finish this story.",A.I. Artificial Intelligence
216,Captain Ed,A big sci-fi misfire for Spielberg,6,14 December 2002,"**SPOILERS**AI: Artificial Intelligence is well-made and well-acted in almost every detail except the script.  Haley Joel Osment is obviously everyone's favorite child actor of the past five or six years, and he does a remarkable job here, although his character growth is almost nil (more on that later, and it's not his fault).  Jude Law plays the charming Gigolo Joe, a pleasure Mecha who stumbles into trouble at a murder scene and by hooking up with David (Osment).  Frances O'Connor is also very compelling as Monica, David's 'mommy', who abandons him in the woods after David unintentionally almost causes the death of her natural son.  Even William Hurt, who I think is overrated, does a very nice job here.However ... this movie shares David's problem: it has no real soul, only glurgy, false emotions that make you want to believe it does.  First, for a science fiction movie, it gets science appallingly wrong.  The setup for the movie is that global warming has caused the polar caps to melt, lifting sea levels to the point where the great coastal cities are submerged.  OK, fine, it's a premise, although not a particularly plausible one if you get your science from other sources than Susan Sarandon.  However, at the end of the second hour, we're told that the oceans freeze in what must be the Earth's worst ever Ice Age!  How in the world (pardon the pun!) do you get from being so hot that the polar caps melt, to an Ice Age of monstrous proportions, IN 2000 YEARS???  Global changes take eons to develop, and while global warming might only take a couple of centuries -- maybe -- global freezing would take hundreds of thousands of years, probably millions.  Earth has had Ice Ages in its past, but not to the point of extinguishing all life, and humans (as a group) would be expected to migrate to habitable areas, not simply freeze to death like deer in the headlights.Second, as other reviewers have pointed out, the climactic scene, after two-and-a-quarter hours, is where Monica is reconstituted from a lock of hair clipped from Monica's head while David was living with her.  There is a completely laughable explanation from an alien explaining how her memories will be reconstituted along with her, but that's not the real problem -- the real problem is that hair DOES NOT CONTAIN DNA.  Only the hair ROOT has DNA. Hair is simply a protein (and so are fingernails, the other substance suggested by the alien).  And here's another thing: if all they need is DNA, then they certainly should find abundant samples of it for humans, although not necessarily a specific individual ... all you need is a body, and every cemetery has lots of those.  They could 'meet' as many humans as they desired, and wouldn't that have been a switch -- having them reanimate humans as if they were robots, and David helping them to control the experiment?Instead, through the bad elementary science, we are given a Pinocchio story that cannot possibly end well.  David travels the world looking for the Blue Fairy that will make him into a Real Boy, and Osment makes this quest heartbreaking, to be sure.  After barely escaping a Flesh Fair (sort of a Disney version of Mad Max: Beyond Thunderdome) where Mechas are destroyed, he goes with Gigolo Joe to Rouge City to see Dr. Know, a Mecha encyclopedia of knowledge (Robin Williams), who directs him to a submerged Manhattan. Eventually he meets his maker, Dr. Hobby, and discovers that he is not unique -- he chances upon assembly lines of Davids waiting to be sold to childless couples.  David, who was made in the image of Hobby's dead son, does not take well to this; he destroys another David-bot who wanted to be his friend, and Dr. Hobby seems peculiarly unconcerned with David's feelings.  At this stage, we would expect an intelligent character to have made some self-discoveries, such as:* I am not a human being, but a machine * I am not a unique machine, but the first prototype of a mass production model * Humans will never love me like one of their own, or even like Mecha Teddy, because I am a threat (just like the other David was to him)And we think this is what happens, too, because David tries to drown himself, although he is saved by Gigolo Joe.  But David sees the Blue Fairy at Coney Island, and winds up trapped there, praying for centuries for her to make him a real boy, even though at this point it would kill him.  Then the world freezes and it's 2000 years before aliens free him up.  Aliens, I might add, with television screens for heads.Pardon me, and my long explanation, but this movie is empty of soul and purpose, although it's full of Spielberg quirks: absent/uncaring father, abandonment and/or loneliness in childhood, overdeveloped fantasy world, yearning for parent's love, robots, cuddly toys, and of course aliens.  When the aliens first appeared, my wife said, ""They even threw in the kitchen sink, didn't they?""  Yes they did, and the ending was simply another throw-in, although Osment and O'Connor made it seem magical and heartbreaking.  This is episodic moviemaking, where things happen only because they happen and little reason is provided for the viewer to care much.I give this soggy mess a 6, because the acting was top-drawer and the cinematography was excellent.  The script, however, is a huge disappointment.  (See Minority Report for a much better futuristic Spielberg movie.)",A.I. Artificial Intelligence
217,Keyser Soze-12,"Without a doubt, the most provocative film I have ever seen. I can't get the movie out of my head.",9,1 July 2001,"I have never seen a Kubrick film in the theater.  I was too young to see Full Metal Jacket, I wasn't born yet to see The Shining, and I really didn't want to see Eyes Wide Shut.  Well, I just came back from seeing one.  Don't let the fact that Spielberg gets the credit for writing and directing this. AI is a Kubrick movie.First, let me show you the VAST difference between the two directors. 
Spielberg makes three kinds of movies: Wonder movies (science fiction films that inspire awe like Close Encounters and ET), Adventure movies (movies that take the audience on a fun ride like the Indiana Jones films and Jurassic Park), and lastly, his War movies (which includes Saving Private Ryan and Schindler's List).  In simpler words, Spielberg makes fun movies. He is an entertainer.  He shoots his films with bright colors and swooping movement.Kubrick was an artist.  No two of his movies are alike, but there are subtle differences.  I can not put into words Kubrick's style.  I just know it when I see it.AI is not shot like a Spielberg movie.  It is shot like a Kubrick movie.  It does have Spielberg's patented usage of lights against dark backgrounds. But the movie is SO different than anything Spielberg has done before. Spielberg has never done a movie about ideas.  He's toyed with it, but Spielberg is a storyteller, not an artist.Okay, you want to know about the movie.  Well, this movie was written and directed by Stanley Kubrick.  I don't care what the poster or credits say, KUBRICK MADE THIS MOVIE.I swear, I just don't know what to think of this movie.  It is a brilliant movie, but it has some serious flaws.  I have never come out of a movie totally bewildered but at the same time amazed at what I had just seen.  AI is an amazing movie, no matter what anybody says.The acting in this movie is BRILLIANT.  Haley Joel Osment is the best actor I have ever seen.  His ability to portray a robot is uncanny.  This kid NEEDS a best actor Oscar for this, and trust me, he's getting it.  Jude Law is also equally brilliant.  Law looks fake.  He acts fake.  His movements and mannerisms are fake.  And it's supposed to be that way.  The guy looks like a robot.  He is defiantly up for best supporting actor.Okay, so what did I think of the movie.  Well, David (Osment) is a robot. He is programmed to love, or it just seems that way.  This is such a weird movie because we can't love David.  He is a robot.  No matter what he does, he is a robot and he has no feelings.  How can you love a robot?  But honestly, as the film moves on, I think David learns.  He really becomes more human with every passing second.To be blunt, the movie is pretty weird.  I mean, I just don't know what to think.  I'm a movie critic, and I can't express what this movie is like.  It has totally blown me away.  I have to see it again.  Not because I didn't catch something, but so I can re-experience the most breathtaking film I have ever seen.I do want to pick on the ending.  I AM NOT GOING TO GIVE IT AWAY!  I don't believe in spoiling people.  But the ending just seems like it's prolonging the inevitable.  It just keeps going.  Once you think it's over, oh no, another ACT comes in.  Oh, and those are robots not aliens.There's just one last thing I want to say.  When I first learned that Jude Law's character was a gigolo robot, I thought it was the dumbest idea I had ever heard of.  But now I understand it.  Both David and Joe are programmed to love, just in different ways.  Joe loves physically, and David loves emotionally.Overall, SEE THIS MOVIE.  It is not the greatest movie ever made.  It will leave you just as unsatisfied as it left me.  But this is an awesome movie both in scope and in presentation.  But the weirdest thing is how it stuck in my head.  I can't stop thinking about it.  Weird.  The whole experience of this movie is cold, uneasy, disturbing and uncomfortable, but for some reason, it is truly breathtaking and awe inspiring.  I mean, that's what Kubrick movies do.  There is one thing about AI that Kubrick never did.  AI has heart.  It truly does.  And heart is something Spielberg does well.AI is the first real artistic movie, both visually and metaphorically, that Spielberg has done with the possible exception of Schindler's List.  This is Kubrick, ladies and gentlemen.  He rose from the grave and made this movie. Get over it.  There's one thing no one can deny: this movie is historic and an instant classic, even though it isn't that good.  Well, one thing's for sure: AI makes you appreciate humanity.No rating, just read the review.  My head hurts.PS: THIS IS NO KID MOVIE!  DO NOT BRING YOUR KIDS!",A.I. Artificial Intelligence
218,Keyser Soze-12,"This is my last review of this movie, I swear",9,6 July 2001,"Okay, I have already written two reviews for AI.  My first review was a real review and my second was an explanation of some logic holes.  But in my first review, I was really confused whether or not I liked the movie.  I knew it was brilliant, but I didn't know if I liked it.Well, I saw AI for a second time a few days ago.  I have come to a conclusion: AI contains alcohol, but in reverse.  Let me explain.I was watching the movie, my second rime, and I was thinking, ""Man, this is not as good as I remembered it being.""  I saw how slow the movie was.  I saw how pointless some scenes were.  I noticed some really ugly dialog.  But, I was enjoying the movie, maybe even more than the first time. 
Well, now it's two days later.  Guess what?  I'm having the exact same after-reaction I had the first time I saw AI.  A few days after I saw AI, both times, I became totally obsessed with it.  It's like a hangover, but good.  I saw how wonderful the movie was.  I saw every thing beautifully. Weird.  Weird.  Weird.So, what does this mean?  Well, it means that AI is not a great movie.  But, it does mean AI is a brilliant movie.  It has stuck into my mind unlike ANY movie I have ever seen.  Now, I remember loving the movie.  I did love this movie.  But, the second time around, I noticed more of the flaws.  But, trust me, there's something about this movie.  Something magical I just can't put my finger on.  I feel like Richard Dryfuss from Close Encounters because I've become totally obsessed with this movie.  I have downloaded all of the trailers.  I've read every review by everyone.  I've read everything about this movie that was ever written.  I have even felt the need to order the poster and preorder the DVD.  What's next?  Mash potato piles in the shape of Teddy?Well, I have finally decided my rating.  I love the movie, but despite my love, the movie is flawed.  It has an ending that is too long.  It has some awkwardness I can't put my finger on (the Chris Rock cameo does not belong). But, I still love it.  I love the TRON motorcycle guys.  I love the Flesh Fair.  I love the ending (though it needs some trimming).  I love the acting.  I love the special effects.  But do I love David?  Can I love something that is not real?  I think David starts out a robot and slowly becomes human.  He learns love, hate, jealously, confusion, and weirdest of all, he learns suicide.  No, that's not how it ends, but he does try it (if you've seen the movie, THINK!).  Is David more human than he seems?  I think so.  This is one of the many questions that AI asks.  For those of you who hated or disliked the movie, I have something to say: at least AI is asking some questions.  No, it doesn't answer many of them. But, did you ever think that maybe the movie shouldn't supply the answers, YOU SHOULD.  Just a though of mine.If you haven't seen AI yet, here's a tip.  Don't expect 2001.  Don't expect ET.  Just go in, relax, have an open mind, and enjoy the show.Rating (I have it this time): EIGHT and A HALF (8 ½) out of TEN (10)PS: I CAN'T STRESS THIS ENOUGH!  THIS IS NOT FOR YOUR KIDS!  This is a very creepy and disturbing movie that creeped me out!  I never get creeped out! And if I got chilled, then this movie will scare the pants off your 8-year-old.",A.I. Artificial Intelligence
219,Keyser Soze-12,Here lies your answers to your logic holes ***SPOILER ALERT***,9,1 July 2001,"I wrote another review of this movie that was a real review.  What follows is a combination of a review and some answers to a lot of questions that people have been asking.  Many people are ruining this movie by pointing out logic holes that flat-out don't exist if you just take some time to think about the movie.  Remember, this movie is more Kubrick than Spielberg, so it's going to be deep and ambiguous (do you remember the ending to 2001 at all?).  I warn you, what follows will spoil the movie, so this is only for people who have seen it.  I normally hate giving stuff away, but I felt that these questions needed answering.Here are some answers for all of the questions that have surrounded AI. 
Question number one: why didn't they design David to not eat food if it shorts out his circuits?  Answer: they did, but David overrided his own programming.  His brother Martin was making fun of him, and David got angry.  He hated Martin.  His hatred overcame his program.  You may say, ""What?  That's the dumbest explanation I've ever heard!""  Well, it's not, because you do the same thing.  In moments of passion, moments of intense emotions of rage or love, human beings loose logic.  Haven't you ever been so mad you didn't think about what your consequences are?  They designed David to be HUMAN, and they did it too well.  Question number two: why does David's mother abandon him? 
Answer: simple, David's journey is an experiment.  The company wanted David to escape so they could test exactly how much he loved his mother.  The movie actually answers this question rather bluntly, but no one obviously was paying any attention.  Remember the scene between David and his maker?Question number three: What is the deal with the aliens?Answer: they are NOT aliens, they just look like it (for reasons only Spielberg knows).  First off, if you look closely, you can see little parts moving underneath their translucent skin.  Second, remember when Joe (Jude Law) said, ""The humans know that in the end, all that will be left is us,"" foreshadowing that one day humans will become extinct and robots will rule the earth.  I honestly don't know why so many people didn't get this.Question number four: What is the deal with the cloning the mother thing?Answer: They didn't clone her.  Think, for a few seconds.  The alien-looking robots know that David is really, really important and they don't want to hurt him.  They want him to be happy.  They also know that he is programmed to be a child.  So they make up the whole DNA thing so that David can somewhat understand (and they know about the hair in Teddy's pocket because they had to fix him too).  In actuality, the robots just sent messages into his brain that seemed like his mother.  In other words, David was dreaming. Remember when David first gets into his new home?  Remember how distorted it looks?  Remember how blurry it looks?  HE WAS DREAMING (kind of).  The reason they said it would only last a day is because they knew they couldn't just leave him there forever, so they gave him a boundary, a reason to ""wake him up"" you could say.That's just what I think.  What do I know, I just took some time to THINK about the movie.  This is a deep movie, so don't just write off something that you don't understand to be a logic hole, because the problem is not the movie.  The problem is you.  This movie is supposed to make you think, like it made me do.  Just take some time and think about it.  Or just sit there like a stubborn Neanderthal.The movie does have problems.  As a person of film, I am not blinded to that.  The ending, while it is a good ending, is too long.  The movie drags, which is never a good thing.  The movie seems like it ends at the ferris wheel (and if Kubrick was alive, it would have) manly do to the fact that the camera backs off and fades a little, like it's ending.  Not to mention Ben Kingsley comes in as the narrator.  Another bad thing is Dr. Know.  It is way too over the top.  The cartoon is way too vibrant and moving around. The movie is too slow for such an animated cartoon to burst in.  Not to mention that it's just stupid.  I know it serves a purpose, but pleaseSo, in conclusion, AI is just a fairy tail for adults.  It's a movie to loose yourself in.  You don't need to think about it, but if you do think about it, think hard so you don't disguise stupidity as logic holes.  This movie is way too artistic for mainstream people.  It's also weird.  It's also creepy.  It's also cold and haunting.  Kubrick is calling us from beyond the grave.  Just accept the movie for what it is.  It is the bravest science fiction movie since Gattaca (or Contact, I forget which came last). The same people who hate this movie are the same people who thought The Mummy Returns, Tomb Raider, and Pearl Harbor where classic movies.  AI is a classic, whether you like it or not.Oh, and please remember that this is no kid's movie.  There are many images in this movie that creeped me out, so imagine what it will do to your kid.",A.I. Artificial Intelligence
220,smashattack,Strays from its own plot too much.,5,21 October 2002,"Artificial Intelligence could have been a good movie.  It could have even been a great movie.  But somewhere along the line it was a little mussed up. I feel that the directors were a little unorganized.Spoilers.Nothing seemed to have to do with anything else.  I found the first half of the movie to be utterly boring since it simply showed how David lived and how the family had to get accustomed to his presence.  Interesting, but not enough to satisfy an avid movie-goer such as myself.Now the second half was a little better.  But it failed to get to the point. David is searching for the ""Blue Fairy"", sure, but that's a little childish.  I mean, great idea, have him search for something that doesn't exist because we will see if a mecha is capable of grief, suffering, and disappointment.  But it didn't get into that at all.Instead, we have a few excellent scenes (with some excellent music) of the flesh fair members as they chase down the exiled mechas.  I was impressed by some of these scenes, even when David hijacked the police helicopter.But, once again, it strayed too much from the plot.  The end is completely wacked out, and not even necessary.  We did not need to see what happened two thousand years later.  I only wanted to know what would happen when David found the ""Blue Fairy"", and the movie showed it.  But then it dragged on for another twenty minutes in showing that David was finally happy, but couldn't really be happy since he could never be real.Jude Law and Haley Joel Osment are both great actors.  However, they could not save this movie.  It was a nice idea, but when it came down to it, it flopped by itself.  Too much going on, not enough with the plot, and definitely not enough action.  I like psychological and scientific movies, but they have to sustain themselves with something more.  A.I. failed to do so.I was very disappointed, to be honest.I would like to comment about the music, but I can't since I didn't hear much of it.  The movie's sounds drowned it out.  I remember when the flesh fair motorcyclists were chasing them, and that was some good music.  I'm not sure if it was done by John Williams, though, since it was obviously not composed.All in all, I would not recommend A.I.  It is too disappointing and too long.",A.I. Artificial Intelligence
221,Michael Kenmore,A masterpiece and Best Film of 2001,10,10 March 2002,"Rarely have I been so emotionally and intellectually simulated watching a film that do not talk down nor spell out to the audience. This film A.I.: Artificial Intelligence is a rare epitome. Terrence Malick's The Thin Red Line, George Miller's Babe: Pig in the City, Orson Welles' Citizen Kane and the uncommon few are fine examples demonstrating that film is indeed an art form. There are subtle and subliminal metaphors throughout the film. In order to perceive the film correctly, you must pay attention from the beginning. The concept is drawn from the source material ""Supertoys Last All Summer Long"" by Brian Aldiss to be developed into a script by Ian Watson and Stanley Kubrick. After Kubrick passed away in early March 1999, Steven Spielberg, as a personal and confidential friend of Kubrick's, was obliged to bring A.I. project to the silver screen. Many of the scenes pay respect to the spirit of Kubrick, e.g. the first shot of Gigolo Joe's face after the fade-in-black transition, the dark and grim Flesh Fair sequence, David's endless quest for love and the deceptively simple happy ending with an underlying complex subtleness of a cruel aftermath. This is a true homage to Kubrick, for he is one of the most intellectually perplexing filmmakers in the history of cinema.I will not elaborate on the story, the visuals, the emotional impact because doing so would ruin the magical experience of watching AI for the first time. AI does have flaws, but it can be overlooked and ignored once your attention is rapt throughout the film. This is a rare film that's intensely moving without the emphasis on sentimentality (as Spielberg is well-known and notorious for) and I cried randomly throughout the film as much as the last half hour of Lars Von Trier's Dancer in the Dark. It is also a rare film that makes people, albeit less forcefully, think and become intellectually active watching the film. For those who hate AI for whatever reason - and that includes the religious right - you have not seen deep enough of the depth of human fallacies as depicted in the film. AI serves as a warning to mankind what happens when we ignore potential consequences in pursuit of war, greed and indulgence. The film is about finding love in the midst of the industrialized world rife with ignorance, violence, cruelty and apathy. That's why Kubrick wanted to tell us that love and empathy are the natural things that should be taken as priority above others in this rapidly developing world.Ai is a visually, emotionally and intellectually stunning film, regardless of inherent logical flaws. AI have the best seamless visual effects ever implemented in a film, which is truly groundbreaking - numerous robot outcasts convincingly played by ""disabled"" actors, Teddy is incredible and the Ice Excavation sequence is the most astonishing and moving visual effect scene I have ever seen. Haley Joel Osment and Jude Law as David and Gigolo Joe are truly spectacular and deserving of Oscar nominations, as do Teddy voiced with sweetness and wisdom by Jack Angel. Had Stanley Kubrick been alive and directed AI, it would be his last and best masterpiece instead of Eyes Wide Shut. Indeed, Kubrick's version of AI - crueler, more violent and colder in trademark film-making style but heart-warmingly subtle and intensely moving to the point of unbearable with mind-blowing seamless visual effects and stellar acting - may very well be one of the best adaption films, if not the FILM ever made.",A.I.

The beginning was really exciting and moved really fast but it just went too deep into the story and Speilberg and Kubrick should of ended the movie 20 minutes earlier or so...*spoiler* The movie should of ended where the boy stares at the fairy down in the ocean forever and then the narrator comes on, at first i thought that was the end but it kept going but it should of ended there. They should never had showed the aliens, that just went too much... but that's my opinion but then the mom's hair thing was pretty clever but then again kind of some what unreal but still good ending...the beginning is enjoyable for everyone but the ending you have to be patient to watch... (lots of people in the theaters were kind of yawning at the night, well also considering the show started at 10:45PM and it's an almost 3 hour movie) but overall i recommend it to everyone!And this is a movie you must see atleast once in your life... This movie is kind of like 'Bicentennial Man' not really but the whole artificial robot thing... but seeing both movies A.I is more touching then Bicentennial Man and more heart stopping, i can't wait to buy A.I on DVD...so many people say Speilberg ruined the movie of Kubrick's work but... i think without Spielberg this movie wouldn't be so touching... Kubrick has a weird mind, Kubrick's ""Clockwork Orange"" was a really distrubing movie... but then again what would i know, i'm only a teenager :Pbut overall i give a 9/10, -1 because the movie kind of moved slow at the end...",A.I.

Very well written and directed by a God among directors (who is definetly not a favorite of mine, but I must respect him) who had to live up to Kubrick-fan expectations.  I thought he lived up to those and made a movie that works wonders.Firstly, the science fiction aspect of this film is similar to Kubrick's Clockwork Orange in that it is not too too far fetched, and that it gives us a message about humanity through a character who we see through an odd, yet interesting, lens.This movie deserves a 9/10, because I did notice some Spielberg-esque techniques, I don't like Spielberg personally, but damn, he made this film a nice, finishing gem in Kubrick's crown.",A.I.

But it was more like old Kubric like Paths of Glory which had a story but still was thought provoking.I completely disagree with those who condemn the last 20 minutes.  So much of this film was dark that even a little bit optimism did not hurt it.  I certainly did not see the ending as joyous either. At times this film seemed to be against anything Christian and was somewhat atheist but that is open for debate I guess by the end.  It seems though that an atheist tinge is present in all good writing that we are allowed to see by Hollywood.  One would like to see some great stories that are written by believers just for balance sake.Also, the film in the end is open for interpretation as to whether it is hostile towards the human race.  Actually Spielberg has many times been critical of the human race.  Even ET had virtually every adult as the bad guy.  My daughter who recently saw ET said ""why are all the grown ups so bad.

I can't believe i spent money on this crap. This was a low point for Steven Spielberg. But he redeemed himself with Minority Report. Overall, i can't remember a more boring time at the movies than with Artificial Intelligence. It sucks down there with XXX. Avoid if you like fun. 3/10",A.I. Artificial Intelligence
228,dalton2,"Mr. Kubrick, please come back",7,27 September 2001,"A.I. is a good film. It's long but it's not boring. Haley Joel Osment is simply incredible, doing the best android performance of all time. I wish he will get this time the Oscar he missed with The Sixth Sense.But some parts in A.I. are a bit too long for my taste. I'm a big fan of Stanley Kubrick and I can say with no doubt that this film has very little from Stanley and very much from Spielberg. Kubrick wanted Spielberg to direct this film for him. Well, I'm sure that it would have been a wonderful masterpiece if Kubrick would have been in the team (and with us, too). He likes total control over his films, as he used to state, so I can't imagine him letting Spielberg to be in charge. What I really think is that he possibly would have let Spielberg be a sort of assistant director although they would have appeared as producer and director, respectively, in the credits. In my opinion, they would have discussed a lot (due to their strong personalities), and I even imagine the film having serious problems during filming. At the end, it would have been a blood-forged film, something as wild as Casablanca is. But it's not. The fact is that Spielberg is in charge, and what we have is another E.T.-like film, something to make you drop your tears, but without the originality, sharpness and power of Kubrick. Kubrick's power goes beyond the limits of the screen and reaches our minds forever. His images, color and use of music are unique, and that's something we probably we won't see again in our lives. Spielberg is a genius director, but he's not the master. Kubrick is the master of cinema. It's a shame he's not with us any more.",A.I. Artificial Intelligence
229,alexx668,Artificial direction..,5,30 March 2009,"This started as a Stanley Kubrick project, not so? You know what's the difference between Stanley Kubrick and Steven Spielberg? Spielberg is not a thinker. He can only go as far as your Indiana Jones and your Jurassic Parks. When he tries to make thoughtful movies, he only accomplishes a huge sense of melodrama (your Schindler Lists et al). He's not a bad director. He's quite good at creating fantasy landscapes. But when you compare a ""Clockwork Orange"" or an ""Eyes Wide Shut"" with any Spielberg film - it's like comparing the theory of relativity to 1 + 1 = 2.The good bits in ""Artificial Intelligence"" have mostly to do with the visuals, and first and foremost the futuristic ring where they killed robots for show - ancient Rome style. That was excessively bleak and misanthropic for Spielberg standards, and the direction pulled it off with paroxysmal neon style. The same can be said for when David prays to his blue fairy in vain and ad infinitum, submerged in the ruins of the abyss. Spielberg also enters Tim Burton territory with the weirdo Las Vegas-styled megalopolis where David and Gigolo Joe go to learn what they should do next.Other than that the film is a collection of stereotypes, unnecessarily slow-paced and draped in huge doses of melodrama, indulging too much in the fairy-tale-an quest of David just to raise but a few simple issues, i.e. that man is dreaming for the ideal but is brought down by the merciless Darwinian sense of evolution.The aliens epilogue is at best silly, and the quasi-oedipal touch with David reuniting with his ""mother"" ranges from boring to corny. The idea of an exploration of humanity via a robot's perspective has been done better in the past (""Blade Runner"" anyone?), and so has the faint parallel with religion (i.e. god creating man, man creating robot). Essentially this is a sci-fi adaptation of Pinnochio.",A.I. Artificial Intelligence
230,gottogorunning,Superb and Unusual,9,13 August 2005,"Artificial Intelligence is like a multiple-walled room with doors on every wall, each door leading to a different destination. I use this simile simply because there are so many ways this film can be read, and indeed so many ways in which this film leads you. It takes you through each and every one of those doors and you have to decide in which destination you stay.Being the final working project of Kubrick, it obviously had high promise. The fact that Spielberg had to finish it off, obviously leads to disappointment. Not because Spielberg does a bad job- far from it- but because one can only speculate how much better Kubrick could have done.There are elements of both directors in the film: the first thirty minutes are very Spielberg, while from about thirty to ninety minutes the Kubrick influence is extremely strong, and this is definitely my favorite part of the film. It's dark and cynical and provides us with a world we are not accustomed to, and don't particularly want to be. While the first section dealt with the dream of a robot boy who could be taught to love, which is quite a corny and clichéd concept, the second section deals with the harsh realities of the inferiority of robots and mankind's inability to accept and adjust to them, and their violent retaliations. The principle character, David, played astonishingly well by Haley Joel Osment, plays a key role in this section. Being young and innocent and carrying an animatronic teddy bear (arguably the greatest character in the film) wherever he goes, he embodies the naivety of your average child growing up in a terrifying world which he does not understand. But in this film, that real-life situation is explored to its extremes.David is helped along his way by another very likable character, Gigolo Joe, one of Jude Law's most interesting performances. The interaction between the two is absolutely fascinating, almost absurdest at times and always with that quirky, Kubrickean feel to it.The quest that forms the central part of the film is essentially nothing more than an appropriation of the Pinocchio story, retold in a science-fiction context: David must become a real boy in order to gain the love of his mother. When he reaches Manhattan where his final destination is supposed to be but in actual fact finds him nowhere else but back at the manufacturer's where he was made, we think the film is over. But in actual fact there is about another hour to run.It is this last hour that is the most criticized, and it is quite clear why. There appears to be too much resolution to the film; there are three different points at which the film could end, and at only one of these it does. All three are very sad and tragic ends, but the third and actual ending is somehow the least fulfilling, it gives you a far more hollow feeling. At first I thought it was just because it is such a bleak portrayal but in actual fact it is simply because personally I felt one of the other two endings would be better, but maybe that's too conventional an outlook.The final resolution is something that has never been done before, in a way that has never been done. It's really unexpected and unpredictable, it deals with a bizarre concept in a very serious manner and essentially finishes for you a movie that one person could never make alone. It's one of the most original and thoughtful endings of all time and really gets you thinking. It is so evident that so many minds and so many hours went into the crafting of this modern masterpiece that you have to appreciate it. The film borders on being silly so often but never quite falls into that trap (I'm still not sure why) and for that I am forever grateful.",A.I. Artificial Intelligence
231,shaid,Surprisingly good,8,24 November 2001,"*May Contain Spoilers* *May Contain Spoilers*There are no 2 directors who are so different from one another than the late Stanley Kubrick and Steven Spielberg. Kubrick made films that were essentially essays. He worked more with his head than with his heart and his films, therefore, were somewhat of cold. Spielberg works from his  heart. He wants to move us. His films are full with sentiments and when you go to a movie made by of one of them you have some expectations. A.I. is the collaboration (or sort of collaboration) of these very different directors and the first thing I asked myself before I went to see this film was: What should I expect? Will I get a cold,theoretical film as I would from Kubrick or a one full of sentiments like I always get from Spielberg?What we got here is a combination of both. For the film itself is a sort of an essay about the human existence. It raise the question what differ us human from the machines, what make us complex and unique(very Kubrick). It also deal with the questions of knowledge and the fact that we humans want always to meet our creator. However there are enough sentiment to make it a Spielberg's film.The story revolve around David (an excellent Haley Joel Osment), a robot-boy who can have feelings and his quest for humanity because he believes that if he become a real person, he has the chance to get his mother back.
We meet David in 4 stages:- 1)His first encounter with his mother and him building a bond with her. It should be notice that this part has been filmed in warm colors. Mostly yellow and brown in order to convey a warm, loving and safe feeling.2)David been expelled from his family and meet the outside world. This part is been portrayed in contrast to the first one. It has been filmed in shades of blue or black.3)David's journey to Man-haten in order to find there the Blue Fairy, where he meets his creator.This part is filmed in grey.4) David's encounter with the aliens. This part combine some of the colors from previous parts but not all of them.David is a symbolic figure. He is naive,un-aware of things much like we would like to be, however his naivete is in contrast to the real peoples who are sometime cruel and brutal(and the scene in Flesh Fair manage to convey both the cruelty of people and their intolerance toward things which are different from them or that they fear because they can not understand them).Through the first 3 stages, where we see David. Spielberg has managed to be Kubrick. He managed to make a cold and theoretical film, much like Kubrick and although he inserted now and than emotions, he let the story lead him and he made me forget that I watch a film directed by Spielberg. Come the 4th part and Spielberg been Spielberg could not be so cold hearted and he inserted so much sentiment that the balance that was well held earlier in the film, has almost vanished. Strange enough the last part deal with how fragile the human existence and the human memory are, and that their chance of survival lie in machines like David. But that message vanish in an over-sentimentally that do not correspond well with the rest of the film.I found the film good and that is surprising if you consider how much  bad reviews it had. Its 143 minutes passed so fast that I didn't notice the time and suddenly the movie finished. For me that a sign for a good movie. I can only advise to anyone who see the movie to ignore what they read(including this review) and judge the movie for itself.

This and the fact that Spielberg and Kubrick, as so many others here have mentioned, are direct opposites, makes it difficult for me to judge this movie. First of all the movie excels in special effects and as a whole works quite well up until the boy is stuck under water. After that something went wrong. The rest is simply too sentimental. Kubrick wouldn't have done it like that. Brian Aldiss would, though. And, eh, Spielberg did. In fact, I think Spielberg hit a note not at all unlike Brian Aldiss', still it makes me wonder, what would this have turned out to be had Stanley Kubrick directed it? To be quite frank, I would have been much happier had Spielberg left it alone and left us with a complete deprivation rather than a feeling of an untimely loss of innocence.No, the movie is not wrong. Spielberg made a marvellous, seeworthy movie. What is wrong is the thought of Stanley Kubrick contemplating making this movie. The mere thought is incomprehensible.

235,Gambitt,not a movie for the masses,6,30 June 2001,"""AI"" shined in some points, but was ultimately pulled in too many directions.  The final product is a bit too much for the average viewer to digest.  One review I read (USAToday) said that ""AI"" was too dark for Spielburg, yet would have been too bright for Kubrick given the way it was made.  The result was a messy compromise that satisfies no one, and even repulses others.For the first 1 1/2 hours, the movie is quite involving.  Some philosophical questions are brought up, but nothing really that original or profound. Nevertheless, I was perplexed as to how the plot would be resolved.  Where was this thing headed?  What was going to happen to our little, android protagonist?During all this buildup, the movie proceeds as a fairly solid science-fiction piece, still grounded in reality or at least what could be, according to the rules of science and logic.  However, the last 40 minutes slipped more into ""science fantasy,"" perhaps even pure ""fairy tale."" 
It's ok to have a dramatic shift in tone, but only if the audience is prepped.  In my case, the theater began to fill with chuckles, murmurs, which eventually evolved into loud outbursts, heckling, and laughter at times that certainly were not supposed to be funny.  Out of a medium-size theater, around 10 people had even walked out by the end.The twists and turns this movie takes are simply too outlandish for the average movie-goer.  By the end of the movie, the audience has lost faith in its believability.  To make matters worse, the incoherent ending drags itself out at least 20 minutes longer than necessary.If this movie did fail, none of the blame should rest on the cast.  Haley Joel Osment is rock solid, and Jude Law shows off his ability to push body language to the max.  Perhaps the most lovable character of all was Teddy, voiced by Jack Angel.  Teddy is David's Jimminy-Cricketish companion and guide.  If an aftermarket of AI merchandise evolves, then Teddy could be the next Elmo.Furthermore, the special effects and sets are nicely done.  The odd everyday devices, machines, household furnishing, vehicles, and other bits of technology ""AI"" shows us look believable, even practical.  Score one bonus point for visual effects.In the end, some of the viewers were clearly upset at having been robbed of $7.  Most were like me, just confused, with this blank expression on my face.  The movie really leaves you wondering.  For example, just what was the main point of the movie?  So exactly what was Spielburg trying to say?",A.I. Artificial Intelligence

He is sent to a family who's lost a son as a changeling. During his stay, he learns about the cruelty in men and how machinery is neglected. He also learns that maybe if he were a real boy (yes, this has some references to ""Pinnochio,"" his mother would accept him, which she does at first, but then neglects after her son is revived.Her son, which we learn later on, is a manipulative brat who grows jealous of David. He tells him to do horrible things and ultimately gets him thrown out of his home. While away from his home, he goes on a journey to become a real boy, even though throughout the movie, he becomes real on his own.Two-thousand years pass, all the humans are gone, but David is still around. He learns that a race of sub-humans have dabbled into bringing back dead things, but have learned that they'll only be alive for one day. So, his mother is brought back, with no memory of abandoning him or of her husband or of Martin. She just remembers David. Throughout the whole day, they live in the moment of everything. And at night, when his mother goes to sleep, David does to.It's truly a disturbing film by Steven Spielberg from a short story adapted by the late Stanley Kubrick. It made me cry at the end, because of David falling asleep. But, the heart of the film is: Do we really love our machinery? Can we really show it love? And if we put a face on them, can they really show emotion? So there's a lot of truth behind it, just sort of dressed up as a drama film. And that's what I liked about it.",A.I.

237,Holdjerhorses,"Has ANY film on IMDb received more comments? (Okay. ""Brokeback Mountain,"" since",10,24 October 2005,"Numerous sci-fi films (from the silent ""Metropolis"" on) ask us to FEAR robots.""A.I."" asks us to love and identify with them. Many audiences cannot make the leap -- though as bioengineering extends human life and replaces worn-out parts, that's exactly where we're headed.That theme alone -- replacing God-made humans with Man-made ones -- cuts to the heart of ""A.I."" in ways that are profoundly disturbing for many people, especially those who are deeply religious. This same theme has ALWAYS disturbed such audiences, from ""The Golem"" through ""Frankenstein."" Yet NEVER, to my knowledge, has the theme been extended to the conclusion it reaches here.EVERY theme in this powerfully produced epic is disturbing, from the opening ""dark waters"" submerging much of the earth resulting from global warming, to the notion of sexual relations with robots (Jude Law's ""Gigolo Joe"" -- another, less savory, robot with whom we're required to identify and sympathize), to treating robots as slaves and endlessly harvesting their parts to keep them ""serving"" us.The imagery throughout is astonishing, and intensely emotional. On and on, powerful images accumulate and evoke equally powerful feelings, fears and thoughts.""But they're only machines!"" we keep defensively reminding ourselves, afraid to go where Spielberg and these themes are leading.One frightening, fateful moment (where David, desperate for a loving souvenir of his human ""mother"", sneaks into her bed and cuts off a locket of her hair, which falls in slow motion into Teddy's hand -- Teddy being a robot companion for David exactly as David is a robot child to his ""mother"") -- is perhaps the most emotionally demanding in the entire film, until the final 20 minutes.Mother awakens, understandably terrified at this robot son with the scissors in her bed -- realizing he might just as soon have stabbed her, had he ""malfunctioned."" WE know David is there out of simple love and desperation. WE also know we would be equally horrified in the same situation.Spielberg, having brilliantly led us to accept a super-robot that can be ""imprinted"" to love, as a child substitute (and brilliantly performed by the best ""child"" actor in films, bar none) . . . Spielberg now demands that we simultaneously identify with our human ""fear"" of our potentially malfunctioning creations, no matter how wonderfully engineered.This remarkable scene requires an unheard-of split identification in the audience's psyche: we love the little robot boy and his robot Teddy and we understand his yearning for his mother's ""real"" love. It's not his ""fault"": SHE'S the one who chose to imprint him so he would love her as a ""real"" boy. We love Teddy, who's David's faithful companion -- his only ""real"" companion, it will turn out, though Teddy, too, is a robot. And we understand the Mother's fright and subsequent realization that this ""machine"" named David has to be abandoned.That's a lot for any director to ask of an audience in one brief scene.It's followed by the abandonment scene in the forest, which critics universally claimed was almost too emotionally painful to watch, so brilliant was Osment's playing.Now Spielberg commits to one of the most disturbing plots ever filmed. From here on, audiences are required to identify emotionally with three robots -- Gigolo Joe, David and Teddy. Humans increasingly become ""the enemy."" Ugly ""humanity"" is repeatedly contrasted with purer ""mechas."" Thus begins the chasm that will ever divide viewers of ""A.I."" One man-made creation (global warming) will destroy God-made humanity and drown ""civilization"" beneath the dark waters that opened the film, while another (robots) will preserve us, at least in circuitry for future generations of ""things"" to study.David and Teddy finally rest alone, underwater, at the base of the Blue Fairy statue that once occupied the entrance to a ride at Coney Island.Why the Blue Fairy? Because David first heard his ""Mother"" read ""Pinnochio"" and understood the Blue Fairy had the power to bring the wooden puppet to life. Finding her is David's quest throughout the film. And once he does . . . he waits.David and Teddy remain in their sealed amphibipod under the waters for 2000 years, while ""people"" (we, the audience) become extinct.They're finally discovered and ""rescued"" by what might be ""humans"" 2000 years down the road . . . or aliens . . . or even more advanced robots. Who knows? The popcorn crowd would head for the concession stand if they weren't glued to their seats.They miss Spielberg's final setup and payoff, as the ""things"" discover that David the robot has the last memories of living human beings in his circuitry, and begin recording them.Then, in a moment that literally made me leap (silently and in near tears) from my seat -- Teddy reveals the locket of David's ""mother's"" hair he's loyally kept for David for 20 centuries, and the ""things"" realize they can recreate her -- but only for 24 hours -- from its DNA.That hair is the last human thing on earth. It will yield the last human recollections on earth. And it will finally bring David what he has sought since she ""imprinted"" him: ""real"" love from the only mother he's ever known . . . if only for one day . . . making David (and us, who've identified with him) ""real"" to himself at last . . . 2000 years since we entered the theatre and these lives . . .

Of course, throughout the film, I was comparing it to Bicentinial Man. I liked that movie alot as well, mainly for the same reasons. A.I. is imaginative, eerie, and yes, long.

240,matlefebvre20,When Steven met Stanley...,8,27 December 2006,"Steven Spielberg and Stanley Kubrick. Two of the most exceptional filmmakers since the invention of cinema. What happens when both visions come up together? The answer is: ""AI"".""AI"" first was a project from Kubrick, but he put it on the hold until special effects were improved enough to allow the realization of the movie. Eventually, Kubrick would die in 1999 and his good friend Steven Spielberg would take on the project and dedicate it to Kubrick.According to the documentary ""Stanley Kubrick: A Life in Pictures"", ""AI"" was always supposed to be Spielberg's movie. Kubrick supposedly asked Spielberg to make it himself because it would be more faithful to his vision. It is known that Kubrick was a master of dehumanization so it's not surprising, when we see the story, that Spielberg gets the directing credits.However, one question still prevails: what if Kubrick made it himself? This question will never be answered and it will remain an unsolved mystery in the history of cinema.Now, back to the actual film. ""AI"" stars Haley Joel Osment (the little boy from ""The Sixth Sense"") as David, a 'mecha' (a robot from the future) who is the first one to be a child and the first built to experience love and to express human feelings. He is adopted by Henry (Sam Robards) and Monica (Frances O'Connor) so he could replace their comatose son Martin (Jake Thomas). However, when Martin recovers and a series of unfortunate accidents occur, David is abandoned.In order to get loved by his 'mother' again, David reminisces ""Pinocchio"" and believes that the Blue Fairy will turn him into a real boy. And so his adventures begin, along with his Jiminy Cricket-like friend: a 'super-toy' named Teddy, who is one of the most extraordinary animatronic creations of the last years.In fact, David's whole story looks like ""Pinocchio"". First, he is created. He then finds adoptive parents but he gets separated from them. His task is to find them back and becoming a real boy. He also has his own companion. The places he visits are also familiar. Flesh Fair looks like Stromboli's puppet show and it's impossible to bypass Coney Island and the whale figure.""AI"" is an amazing movie and there are numerous reasons to precise it. First, Haley Joel Osment is nothing less than astounding and his interpretation of David will leave you completely dumbfounded.The special effects and the futuristic sets get almost the rest of the attention. Spielberg's vision of the future is surreal and dazzling and the FX are nothing short of miraculous. It's another home-run for Industrial Light & Magic.Those who are nostalgic of Stanley Kubrick will find some elements coming from the regretted film legend. It could be allusions to Kubrick's own movies or simply methods used by Kubrick himself.For example, ""AI"" and Kubrick's ""Barry Lyndon"" have the same point of common: they both try to transform the natural into artificial. The characters in ""Barry Lyndon"" becomes living paintings from the 18th century while the actors become convincing robots and Jude Law's mannequin-like haircut sticks in my mind.Rouge City seems to come from ""A Clockwork Orange"" and David's attempt to cut some of his mother's hair with scissors could be an allusion to ""The Shining"", especially with John Williams' background score. The shots of an extra-terrestrial traveling into a gap in NYC look like the star-gate sequence in ""2001"" and so is David's meeting with an alien later.Kubrick's methods are also used, although not frequently. I remember the zooming out sequence in the mecha room at Cybertronics and David's face when Teddy falls from the net in the forest sequence.In general, I'd say that Kubrick would have loved this movie, expect for the ending. In fact, no less than three potential endings are shown in this movie. According to me, Kubrick would have stopped at the second one, but as it is Spielberg, it goes on to provide more eye-popping visual FX and especially to feed the viewer with a happy ending.It's not a bad thing in a usual way, far from it, but it's at this moment that ""AI"" stops to be an homage to Kubrick and it then begins to be Spielberg's own.Except for this technical shortcoming, ""AI"" is a unique masterpiece, another exploit for Steven Spielberg and a perfect way to honor one of the greatest filmmakers of all time.",A.I.

241,Andreas_N,Typical Spielbergian quest,8,9 November 2005,"Yeah, a great movie. It's both Haley's de-luxe performance in one of his most demanding roles and the visual artwork applied by Steven Spielberg. The mother-son aspect is really emotional. I also liked Jake Thomas' appearance, which was short but very smart and straight. Again, there aren't many young actors around who would have succeeded in playing Haley's character in here as sophisticated as he did. Wonderful movie. It's not one of my favorites though, as there's too much emphasis on special and visual effects to my mind that detracts the viewers' attention from the storyline. It generally features a nice cast.

242,darkjosh,Intelligent Art,8,7 August 2001,"Perhaps the most interesting, fascinating, and frustrating thing in Steven Spielberg's and posthumous Stanley Kubrick's sci-fi drama A.I. is watching the two directors' visions clash onscreen: the dark, somber creeping of Kubrick and the family-film, goodness, and optimism of Spielberg intertwine in such a smooth manner, it's bound to leave audiences baffled and not liking the film.  In fact, it's this schizophrenic tone that makes A.I. a better film than it should be.The story is reminiscent of Robin William's 1999 sappy outing, Bicentennial Man, in which a robot goes on a quest to become a human; the difference is that here there are no easy answers.  A.I. takes place in a future when robotic servants are commonplace.  Haley Joel Osment (in a role that will surely garner him awards), plays a robot boy created with the unique ability to love.  When he is abandoned by his parents in the woods (in a particularly heart-rending scene), he is left alone and embarks on a quest to become a real boy, in order to regain his mother's love.Spielberg poses many questions on the meaning of love and life, and thankfully he does not present neat and tidy answers.  There are numerous times the film seems to be on the verge of mis-stepping and turning didatic or sugar-coated, but it remains somber and never indulges in either preachiness or shameless emotional milking.  It never panders to the audience with simple solution as to the relationship between machines and their makers.  While the film is sympathetic to the robot characters, it doesn't make out the creators to be monsters toying with nature. 
Visually, the filmmakers creates some astonishing set pieces, imagery, and sequences, including a breathtaking view of New York halfway submerged in water and Coney Island under the sea.  The surreal special effects are aided by ghastly makeup effects as well as striking, barren, desolate set designs.A.I. is easily Spielberg's most complex movie to date, as well as the summer's most intelligent and challenging film amidst loud, abrasive action films and money-hungry sequels.

243,poem,A definitive lack of story,1,30 October 2001,"No question - acting is excellent here. I never thought I would weep about a robot child. But what does this movie want to tell us ?Other movies, such as Gattaca, are about a problem, show us the aspects of it, link it to personal experiences, and maybe even suggest some ideas how to solve or handle it.But what we get here is just a Pinoccio story. And even that one is less interesting than the original Pinoccio ! Spielberg gives us sugar where sugar is the last thing we want from him. The end was especially cheesy, he had to make his Pinoccio happy no matter how hard it would be, but that looked quite absurd.I'm sorry, but this one simply doesn't operate. It is a child movie about a serious theme, that cannot work !",A.I. Artificial Intelligence
244,bilahn,If Only Kubrick had lived to direct this,7,2 July 2001,"A.I. starts out promisingly. The first third is the most Kubrick-like part of the film, and sets up a story that is both thought provoking and very relevant. Unfortunately, from a certain point, the movie becomes pure-Spielberg, a child-like fairly tale again, full of sweetness and light, that is still, curiously, not at all appropriate for younger children.  As the film progresses, contrivances, schmalz, and manipulation become rampant, and only the stunning visuals of the movie kept me interested (and the movie is quite long).The final scenes are so derivative of previous Spielberg (and Kubrick) films, that it really is almost a joke, and embarrassingly maudlin, at least for me. How much you like A.I. may depend on how much the basic premise pushes your own personal emotional buttons. It pushed none for me. I can't help but wonder what Kubrick would have done with this move. Surely it would have been a darker, more adult film, more thought provoking and other worldly.  I certainly would have liked to seen a richer exploration of the issues involved here, as well as the cosmic implications of what is happening to mankind in the future. As in Jurassic Park, Spielberg has instead taken an intelligent story, and made it into ""family"" entertainment, except that's is not really suitable for the whole family at all. Worth seeing, but ultimately very disappointing.",A.I. Artificial Intelligence
245,Pingo-2,The worst movie Spielberg ever made,1,7 October 2001,"This is definatly the worst movie Steven Spielberg ever made. I have never really liked any of Kubrick's work, but this one is unique in its bad performance.I began watching this movie with an open mind and hoped for a pretty good movie. I simply love Spielbergs other movies, and thought that this should be at least equally good as his other films. I was very wrong.The beginning is good. I felt that David, the robot-with-feelings, was a good character and Haley Joel Osment, playing him, does a remarkable job. However, the story isn't only bad, it is repulsing!I have seen films with discusting stories before - as Re-Animator and Nekromantic to name just two - but instead of making a point or being fun to watch, A.I. just gets worse and worse. After two hours you are not only sick of that stupid robot, you are totally bored too!But the movie goes bad long before two hours. It begins in the first scenes with David and his mom. The music - it is really bad made and doesn't as in Spielbergs other movies, add anything to the feel or mood of the movie - it is just painfully annoying!Jude Law, who usually is a great actor and who plays nice parts in Enemy at the Gates and eXistenZ, is here pretty boring and plays a mediocre part as the sex-robot Gigolo-Joe. The scenes with Joe are however, the only scenes that are enjoying to watch.The background and the reason why robots are built are good, and it holds through the at least a bit interesting ending, however, the narratives that are added to the film in the end seem to have only one purpose: To keep the audience from falling asleep!With its 145 minutes, this is one of the most boring films I've ever seen. It is, as I said, Spielbergs worst performance ever. Has he gone old and lost his brains? What was he thinking trying to do such a discusting film?This movie is not even worth the money it costs to rent it. If you can see it for free, sure, do it, but you will be wasting almost three hours of your life that can be used for much better purposes.A.I. is a film I get angry of watching and few movies do that to me. Since I really enjoy Spielbergs other movies, I really hope that he will make up for this foolish attempt of trying to be deeper than he really is...",A.I. Artificial Intelligence
246,Deckard-16,2001's 2001,10,19 July 2001,"Steven Spielberg has wowed and surprised me in the past and although the sheer brutality and grit of ""Saving Private Ryan"" may approach it the shock of ""A.I."" caught me reeling. This is an astonishing motion picture. It is a science fiction movie that invites (even demands) deep thought while it stirs up some of our deepest hopes, dreams and, most unexpectedly, fears. I think it is that last emotion that is driving people away from this film. In Spielberg's boldest move ever he has taken a story that the legendary and late Stanley Kubrick worked on for years and kept Kubrick's chilling genius as the driving force behind this gem. I'm still trying to decide if ""A.I."" is more of a Spielberg film or a Kubrick film. This, in itself, is amazing. The film is filled with visual wonders too numerous to point out. The performances range from good to excellent. Haley Joel Osment carries the film brilliantly, Jude Law is a lot of fun to watch and William Hurt brings the necessary gravity to his role as a visionary scientist. Spielberg's team matches his (and Kubrick's) aim. It is quite an experience. But a large part of any problem that people will have with this film is that it is ""quite an experience"" and not ""just a movie"". It is difficult to shake off. As far flung as it is in its futuristic trappings (as any really good sci-fi film should be) ""A.I."" is ultimately about love and the wonder and the fear of it. It is a rather dark take on a subject as unexplainable as anything science fiction has ever dreamt up. I found it heartbreaking and occasionally terrifying, but I was transfixed nevertheless. I can't believe Spielberg had the guts to pull this off and I don't think he would have before making ""Schindler's List"" and ""Ryan"". And he did it with all the conviction and expertise of his best work (""Schindler's"", ""Ryan"", ""Close Encounters"" and ""E.T."") ""A.I."" is already going down like ""2001"" as a greatly misunderstood masterpiece. This is definitely the most daring movie Spielberg has ever made. It is a very dark fairy tale.

A I says a lot about the world we live in with it's throw away values, a person or an animal is only good until we tire of it then we dump it somewhere without thought or feeling, David is a mech boy played wonderfully by Haley Joel Osment who is adopted by a family and cared for and loved until he is not wanted anymore then dumped in the woods along with his supertoy bear Teddy who has the same voice patterns as Hal in 2001, David thinks if he can find the blue fairy he can be turned into a real boy and go back home but his journey only leads to sadness. The cast of A I is average except for Jude Law as Gigolo Joe, a love bot who cant seem to stay out of trouble. The good parts of A I are very good and will make you think about things around you, also the music is wonderful.

It was done much, MUCH better on a few different episodes of Star Trek: TNG.Let me say again, this movie was really bad!   I mean I could not BELIEVE how terrible it was!  And I don't think Speilberg shot it on actual film stock, I think he just used a paste of Honey and Sugar mixed together! Jeez!  This movie was sooooo soppy-sweet.  With the big, over-dramatic swells in the music.  And Haley Joel Osmints character going on and on about how he ""loves his mommy.""  Over and over again!  This movie was so annoying! And it went on FOREVER!  TWO AND A HALF HOURS of my life WASTED watching this complete BUTT-DRAG of a movie!  This movie was so stupid, the script seemed as though it had been written by a twelve year old girl.
I hated every FRAME of this long, boring pile of CRAP and I you are goofy in the head if you liked it.I am voting this movie a 1, ONLY because the IMDB rating system does not go in to negative integers.

Every time I watched one I would think ""I should pick this up some day, looks interesting"". Kept saying that for years.Finally picked it up. Most of the time when you talk to someone about a movie, they ask ""what was it about""? This is about so many things: the human condition, advances in technology, limits of morality, the line between real and artificial, empathy and self righteousness.A robotics company makes a robot boy. They program the boy to be able to love. Can a machine love? If it can, isn't it just as ""real"" as we are? Would it be moral to abandon this machine to fend for itself? How about it the machine was made to be a child? Parts of the movie will have you thinking abut these questions while enjoying the story. The ""boy"" has been taught fairy tales and believes himself akin to Pinocchio, beginning a search for the blue fairy that ends thousands of years in the future.Great story, great acting, great production values.

We kept waiting for something or someone for you to get attached to. Haley Osmet was VERY good but his character alone and his quest were not enough to make us ever see this movie again.  Not even as a rental. Some parts were so slow we and others in the theater were falling asleep. 
Not an optimistic outlook for our future at all.  I refuse to look for inspiration from a Robot whose creator was trying to do something for mankind and create a market for a new product.  Gee, I think the drive for the new product won.  I do not recommend sitting for 2 hours and 25 minutes seeing this movie. Spielberg has done and could do much better.

Start the real film when the kid gets dumped. AI only really comes alive when Jude Law dances in, literally. What a revelation he is in this role. End the film with disappointment when Osment finds Hurt. He has to learn that Pinochio is just a story and that Hurt is his real father. So what if it only runs 70 minutes?

This couple Kubrik-Spielberg does not work. A.I. looks at my eyes as an old movie a little modernized. Almost all Kubrik's or Spielberg's movies are better than this . The story (futuristic remake of Pinocchio) is more stupid than the original. This cyberboy, learning from the experience, after reading the Collodi's old book Pinocchio, starts to say that it wants become a real boy. Indeed it is a perfect toy, it talks but really it does not think and its emotions seem real but real are not. Stupid people cry during the movie like the boy was a real boy but it is a cyborg and really it does not understand anything..... just it says nonsenses and that's it. The only very good thing in this too long, stupid and boring movie is the cast: H.J. Osment is great in acting and also J. Law. I don't know if the target of this movie should be the children or the married women or maybe the old people, for sure I suggest to avoid this movie to people from 13 to 45 years old.

255,victor7754,Why make us believe in something that does not exist?,10,11 April 2004,"Remember learning about Santa Claus? The disappointment was tremendous and the first betrayal to the spirit. Why make us believe in something that does not exist? This is an underlying theme in Artificial Intelligence. David, the robot wishes to be real. It is kind of like how humans seek immortality. Does it exist? Probably not but it is wiser to believe. The film goes on to suggest that humans are acting unconsciously as a whole in creating immortality. Creating God in a way. If we have the capabilities to program the human condition into robots then there is no need for the flesh.Logic will lead. The spirit is in question. A.I. plays on the idea that love breathed life into David; pure unconditional love for his mother. This love drives him to the end of the world to find his creator.A beautiful and lyrical film. 2nd time viewing was even more fascinating. The end bogs down but hang in there because the film has a unique philosophy on a possible outcome of our existence; spirit and machine. Not likely, but it is the passion; the passion of Christ that is. A.I contained more passion about Christ than The Passion of Christ. The film suggests that David is pure love as was Christ. There is an argument in the film. It is covered oh so cleverly because no one hears it. David does not mean to deceive yet that's what he does, thus beginning the next step in evolution. Why would humans let this happen? Because David is a child. No. He is machine. When David is about to be fried at the Burning Man rally the Host preaches to the crowd not to be deceived by the child. He is a machine and will take our children away. The host is booed and harassed as David yells out that he does not want to die. David's cries and perfect resemblance of a boy is that of the AntiChrist, the great deceiver. At least that is what the spirit would tell us. David threw the stoned that destroyed the human race. ""I do not want to die"" The Host loses.A.I. has so many beautiful moments. It is a great achievement. Overlooked by the populous most likely due to the eccentricities. It seems to suggest in the end that there is no Santa Claus and that believing in Faerie Tales might be the best way to glide through life because it is beautiful to be alive and to love is the best way to go. ****",A.I.

256,pazu7,Faulty Intelligence about A.I.,10,17 January 2011,"I stayed out of the debate on this film for years, at least at the film sites. But after seeing it described as a blend of 'Kubrick's starkness and Spielberg's sunny optimism', I decided to post my 2 cents.You can tell by my rating I loved it, but my reasons were personal and I admittedly did not have an objective viewpoint about it, and still do not to a large degree. Let's just say that while it has a special place in my heart, I would not necessarily recommend it to everyone. It's not for everyone. It's like a science fiction for shameless romantics. That considered, it is truly a science fiction and poses some serious philosophical questions for those undaunted by the site of cute little robots crying for 'Mommy'.I did notice that after the DVD came out the ratings started going up. This verified my theory that, while in theaters, AI was the victim of some harsh word-of-mouth from the unrelenting critics of all things Spielberg. I felt that when the DVD came out and people started seeing it for themselves it would fare better. That's proved to be the case.But to this day much of the faulty intelligence about A.I. remain. Spielberg did not write the sunny optimistic parts of AI. There were actually no optimistic parts of AI, but those touching bits that could be mistaken for optimistic were in the original screen story. One would think it would be pretty well known by now that Spielberg actually wrote the grim bits about the Flesh Fair and the dark segue that leads from the bottom of the ocean to 2000 years later when he meets up with his reanimated ""mother"" in a reunion scene that was in Ian Watson's original screen story; the one that Kubrick approved and Spielberg filmed almost note per note.This intelligence is not artificial and it comes from from the horses keyboard. My email conversations with Ian Watson revealed some other things about the story, some of which you can find by reading Watson's ""Plumbing Stanley Kubrick"", a tell all essay about working with the late great Kubrick, and some of which you can find in my own essay ""Facts & Fairy Tale: Setting The Record Straight On A.I."" Google should find both if you are interested enough to seek them out.In conclusion, whether or not AI is a great film on an objective basis...? I will stay out of that argument. Largely because I just don't care. I like it and that's good enough for me. Anyway, it's standing on it's own merits now that most of the Spielberg bashing criticisms have been debunked.But I will say that if one is to criticize the film, at least get your facts straight. And the facts in this case suggest that if AI is not exactly as Kubrick desired, it's pretty damned close.",A.I. Artificial Intelligence
257,RolloTomasi,"Noble and ambitious but, ultimately, inconsequential",5,4 July 2001,"""A.I"" is set in the plausibly distant future, one we seem to be headed for. If you go see this for nothing else, check out the world Spielberg creates and how he makes you believe it. The visual effects are the best I've seen.
This is likewise the most accurate rendering of the future I've seen. There aren't giant mega-cities ruled by machines, nor has there been a nuclear holocaust. This future isn't based on flights of fancy, but is honest about the direction the human race (well, at least here in the U.S.) is heading in. Robots that can think for themselves, created by humans to fulfill human needs, may not be possible. But if we ever do create something as advanced as Artificial Intelligence, you have to think it would be this way. What's one of the first functions these beings would be used for? Of course, sex. There can be no denying it. The Gigolo Joes and their female counterparts would be the first ones off the assembly line.In this story, many kinds of robots have been created and discarded for a newer model, just like today's computers. These robots serve humans, but are also self-reliant. These robots have will. They want to survive. This creates a paranoia about them, which leads to the dreaded Flesh Fair. Old junked robots are captured and destroyed in all kinds of creative ways before a cheering crowd--the future equivalent of BattleBots, WWF or Monster Trucks. The Fair and the scavenger robots it victimizes is but one of many great ideas ""A.I."" offers.When the Flesh Fair crowd finds out scientists have created a child, no one can believe it. Why make a child robot? What purpose could it possibly have? Before too long someone figures it out: Somewhere out there, there's a mama who lost her child or a man and woman unable to conceive. All of a sudden these ""Mechas"" (Mechanicals) don't look so bad after all.
David is programmed to love his mother forever if he is read seven certain words in a certain order. Once his love is turned on', love in this case being a program that begins running, it cannot be turned off. This is very profound and meaningful, so I appreciate that the film doesn't konk you over the head with this: once you love someone--really love someone, not like puppy love, twitterpation, infatuation, even the love behind most marriages--but REALLY love, like the way a mother loves her child, it cannot be turned off. We often love people who don't love us back because that's just the way it is. We even love people who are mean to us. That's why it's love. It's not a decision, but a condition. Love can make you crazy, drive you to make weird choices--like abandoning your robot son in the woods to fend for himself because he's a danger to your real son. Yes, Monica does the compassionate thing, the right thing, and that's why it's so sad.
Now David is lost and alone, without the one person that matters to him, also knowing that person can't love him because he's not a real boy.' David believes he can become real with the help of the Blue Fairy from Pinnochio,' which he doesn't understand is just a fairy tale. Aiding him on his quest: the aforementioned Gigolo Joe, who'd just like to turn that blue' into something else. Hey, it's what he does (thank goodness Spielberg refrains from showing Joe teaching David how to dance and walk the way he does--not that there weren't a couple of threatening moments).I want to talk about the ending but I don't want to say spoilers!' because then people won't read on. So I'll be as vague as possible and just say (gasp!), it worked for me. Many have said that one ending was enough. True, the Manhattan/Coney Island scene would've been a great ending for any film: a satisfying, open-ended, fitting (but very sad) close to the story. This was the only point where I wondered why it kept going. But as I watched on, it started to make sense. The film becomes very somber and visual (the Kubrick portion of the story if you will) or what others would call slow.' Well, I'm a patient movie-goer so I'll sit through almost anything. This ending, however out of place it may feel, does tie up the story nicely. There are some parallels with the story's beginning and I like stories that end that way. Whether the film is better with or without this last half-hour I couldn't say. Maybe I'll go see it again and run away right when that moment comes.As for whether it's good or bad, which I haven't really expressed one way or the other--well, I have concerns. There's a whole lot of story here and it feels like too much even for a 2 and-a-half hour film. The first half is very good, but feels like merely the set-up for a bigger, bolder story to come. This bigger story never materializes. Not that one should materialize, it's just the signal the opening hour seems to be sending. Thus, the whole problem I had with it: the film wants to be about deep love that lasts thousands of years, but just ends up sending mixed signals.

259,starlit-sky,Artificial Intelligence And Artificial Love (Contains Spoilers),7,2 July 2001,"I have found Artificial Intelligence to be a movie more about concept of love than artificial intelligence. It was also about man's desire to be God and a robot's desire to be a boy. The movie touches upon a lot of philosophical issues, some which are left unanswered for the audience to ponder upon -in Kubrik's style- while it deals with the other more directly -in Spielberg's style. On the whole, I have found the story to be out of focus.  The story takes place in the future where most of the world is flooded under waters due to melting of the ice at the polls, most of the world's population is destroyed and the remaining humans have very scarce resources to survive, which restrains them from reproducing further and leads them to use artificial intelligence instead, because robots are more economic. Professor Hobby (William Hurt) expresses his desire to build a robot that can love so they can produce baby-robots that will ultimately meet the people's desire to have kids. The question: how the robot's desire to be loved will be met or does the capacity to love always co-exist with the desire to be loved? This was the dilemma that the movie was dealing with most, although I think that if a person can love unconditionally then a robot can be programmed to love unconditionally as well. However, in the movie this is proved otherwise. There is also the question if love is a set of responses triggered under certain conditions. We expect a certain response under a certain condition and if we get that response, we feel loved and vice versa? But the whole point is we want this response to come from a free-willing agent, not from a being who is programmed to give that response (However, there is the philosophical debate about whether we humans are programmed too, in much more sophisticated ways than robots, since what kind of response we will give is printed in our genes/DNA). A family, Mr&Mrs. Swinton whose only kid, Martin, is in a coma, adopts David (Haley Joel Osment), the first robot programmed to love. At first, things are a little awkward but then they gradually turn to normal. However, when Martin miraculously recovers from coma and returns home, everything takes an ugly twist. Martin is displeased with the presence of a robot boy in the house and tries to get rid of David by running a plot. Consequently, Swinton family decides not to keep David and deserts him in the forest. David is devastated when he faces the fact that he is not loved and his pursue to be a real boy begins. In the forest, he observes other mechas poking around the trash of used robot parts to make up for the ones they are missing. If the robots feel incomplete because of all their missing parts in their bodies then aren't they already very much human-like? From where do they get the feeling of being incomplete? A little later, we also find out that not only do they feel incomplete but they also fear death, the end of their existence. These two emotions show that all the other mechas are already very much like humans, not just David. And the fact that Teddy (bear) follows David to the Flesh Fair is also an indication that even a little robot has an emotion of bonding. All these indications, in my opinion, contradict with the movie's claim that David is unique. Faith brings David together with Gigolo Joe (Jude Law), another mecha, and the two escape after a commotion in Flesh Fair, which breaks out when the audience screams at the host of the show ""He is a boy!"" One may think that is supposed to make him feel like he is a real boy, however, David doesn't feel so.  Is that because his desire, in the core, is not to be accepted as a boy but rather to be loved by his mommy? David and Gigolo Joe later go to see Dr. Know, a virtual oracle, and learn the whereabouts of the Blue Ferry that has the power to convert David into a real boy. David finally finds what he believes to be the Blue Ferry which, in fact, is nothing but a statuette of Blue Ferry under the sea amongst the ruins of Entertainment Park. Praying to be converted to a real boy, David parks his space/sea craft in front of the Blue Ferry. Next thing we know is that 2000 years have passed, the world is, once again, under ice and entire human race is destroyed. This is where the movie becomes a little strange because the world is inhabited by an alien race; this is a major metamorphose from the main framework of the movie and it seems a bit unnecessary. Alien beings rescue David from the ice-covered spacecraft in which he spent 2000 years. David asks the aliens where his mother is and Aliens acknowledge him that the entire human race is gone, his mother is no longer living and they can bring to life only the humans of whom they uncover from under the ice. I don't want to spoil it for you how they bring Mrs. Swinton to life because I think this part of the movie is smartly done. Sadly, it turns out that the humans raised from dead can survive only for a day. There was a science-philosophical message, told by an alien, which I think is the reason why Spielberg made the movie end that way. The alien says every matter in the universe can be at one space at a certain time only for once and that combination never repeats again, as an explanation why they cannot raise the dead for good. As for the acting, I was very impressed by the performance of Haley Joel Osment who steals the show. If he can keep acting like this then he is sure to become a great actor.",A.I.

Oh sure, the movie runs along fairly smoothly and is done very well for the most part, except for the beginning and ending, which unfortunately ruin the entire film.  The beginning is filled with an extremely phoney and amateur philosophy bull session which clumsily states all the themes of the film (which makes one wonder why it is necessary to view the film at all).  The ending, quite frankly, goes screaming beyond silly to absolutely ludicrous; it relies on completely irrelevant, artificial, and not to mention just-plain-stupid plot devices to resolve the film a million miles away from any rational expectations. 
If you can get past that, it's a great film.  :)IRONY WATCH and SPOILER: The film actually takes one step further at the end to total HYPOCRISY when David allows another life form to be made just so it can love him.

262,cleary-joshua,A film that definitely ended up with the right director...,9,26 August 2013,"Steven Spielberg directing a project originally meant for Stanley Kubrick is, for some film lovers, an idea of hell. However I think the story absolutely found the right director, who, despite being famous for over-sentimentality, takes this futuristic fairy tale (Essentially just updated ""Pinocchio"") and makes it personal and relatable. It's actually surprising at times how this story, which is a kid's story in disguise, is one of Spielberg's most adulterated movies.The film is made up of three very different segments, all tied together by the main character, David, played fantastically by Haley Joel Osment. It still surprises me that he is no longer famous, since he had more fantastic performances (Forrest Gump, Sixth Sense, A.I.) than some major actors have ever had. Osment brings across the robotic side of David through his slightly impersonal side, but also the emotion and pathos of the child. The first segment, which takes up roughly the first half of the film, deals with the idea of being different and being accepted. It shows the struggle that David's mother is having in accepting him as part of the family, knowing him to be a robot and not her real son. We also see the sibling rivalry between the real son and the robotic son, who only wants to be loved by his mother.The second segment is when Jude Law enters, and deals with the loss of innocence. David is thrown out of his simple household life into the dark world of a twisted anti-Mecha destruction fair, a whole city built on sex and a murder. Jude Law's performance is fantastic as the robot gigolo, and he proves himself to be a strangely effective mentor and carer for the child. The 'Dr. Know' scene is really interesting and Robin Williams is the perfect voice for the role. When eventually David is trapped staring at the Blue Fairy statue, you see just how much he longs to be loved, how he is only a child, and it is a feeling that the viewer can easily build up a connection to.The third segment is strange but acts as a fitting conclusion to the story. The futuristic robots seem slightly out of place because the majority of the movie doesn't include them, but David's brief reunion with his mother is very emotional, and Spielberg leaves it on a fantastic ending, leaving what happens next to be ambiguous, but making us know what really happens. ""A.I."" has to be one of Spielberg's best movies in years and it's proof yet again that he is one of the greatest living directors. The film is visually enthralling, superbly acted and tells a story that we all have a connection to in one way or another.",A.I. Artificial Intelligence

Written by Brian Aldiss ( short story) and Ian Watson ( screen story) and Steven Spielberg ( Screen Play). Directed by Steven SpielbergNot my cup of tea. Maybe it is more aimed at a younger age group. But not my kind of film.I found this to be too far fetched and the story was long winded and the plot was all over the place. The special effects are great and the acting was good but the plot let's this one down in my opinion. To use the analogy of a book, there was absolutely nothing to keep me wanting to turn the pages. It lacked a hook or I didn't have any desire to know what happened next. Plus I didn't really like any of the characters whatsoever, apart from the cute bear!

264,Denver53,A Dark Mess,5,9 July 2001,"I love sci-fi. I also am usually fascinated by Kubrick and enjoy Spielberg. But A.I. was a hash of both directors, and in the end seemed like a bunch of odds and ends were thrown in just to give it the prerequisite happy ending.If you haven't seen the movie yet, I'll try to hold off on spoilers until later and I'll warn you then. No doubt about it, A.I. is a dark movie. I saw people bringing in to the theatre little kids and wondered what in the world they were thinking. A.I. could have left kids of an especially impressionable age, say under 10, with nightmares for weeks.A.I.'s setting is very much like Blade Runner (a much better examination of how humans might one day view advanced artificial intelligence). That setting is well done and makes you think about the logical progression from today's pets to tomorrow's robots which many people will undoubtably treat as pets (just as many people today treat cats and dogs atrociously).A.I.'s main story, about David the robot-child, is much less well done. His story, and the actions of his ""parents,"" leave so many holes you start wondering right at the beginning what is wrong with these people and oh please let's not let the humans of tomorrow be this dumb.
Before I point out some examples, I want to make one general point. While the movie is certainly dark, it is coherent until a point about 20 minutes from the end, where, to avoid spoiling it, David is goes 20,000 leagues under the sea. If the movie had ended there, then it at least would have been a clear statement about the weaknesses and foibles of humans. But from that point, it was like a second movie began. It was almost as if Close Encounters had merged with A.I. And it really ruined the message of the film, for me.Now, some spoiler questions. Can anyone answer: Why would you get a robot boy, which would of course never age? Do you want a child of 10 (or whatever) for the rest of your life? Why did the mother selfishly imprint David only on her? Why would a company make almost-real child for families but make every one the same and call them all David or Arlene? Doesn't that defeat the point of ""owning"" such an advanced and unique mecha (I can see it now, 523 Davids at the mall on Saturday afternoon)? Why wasn't some kind of microchip put into David so he could be tracked if we went renegade (for that matter, why weren't all mechas chipped)?And those are just the larger questions. Ultimately, I found the setting and the examination of the way people adjust to AI (a la Blade Runner) interesting, but didn't care much for the story of David or his obviously grief-stricken and unthinking parents. I don't know whether Kubrick of Spielberg was responsible for either  or both, but the combination was much less effective than if one vision of the other had been consistent. We gave A.I. a 5, which over time might become a 6, simply because this movie was certainly emotionally involving, even when it became a mess.",A.I. Artificial Intelligence

Steven Spielberg has done a magnificent job. I don't know how to express my feelings, but I can say that AI is one of the greatest movies I've ever seen in my entire life. It dazzles your eyes and evokes your pure emotion. It made me think of the human place in the world more than ever and how we are increasingly distancing from that.  I couldn't miss any shot of it. Of course, I believe that AI originally belongs to Stanley Kubrick and probably it should have been directed by him, but Spielberg did his best and of course he succeeded as well. I want to watch it for 2000 times, but what a pity, I can't live this long. The final sequences of the movie are unforgettable. Osment, unlike his previous movie - Pay It Forward - is wonderful. On the other hand, AI tries to emphasize on human as the supreme creature of Nature(Or God, no matter what you call it). So, why this superior existence is getting hurt by its own species?

Haley Osment's character also loses track and decides he's just like Pinocchio. I lost interest in the end.

However, A.I.'s state of the art visuals and gorgeous John Williams score don't make up for a screenplay that is too long, too episodic, and at times so bad it comes off like a film student's first draft. I am not a great admirer of Spielberg, but I had high hopes for this project. My disappointment was shared by some in the preview audience who started laughing at the film around the two hour mark. On the other hand, the woman next to me was crying at the end, and some in the audience applauded. You'll be the judge.Update:2007 I'd say the real failure of AI begins as soon as the boy is abandoned by his mother. Up until then the movie is strongly involving. But most of the central part of the movie just doesn't work for me. I think a much shorter movie, with much of the boy's wandering condensed (and the complete elimination of the mekka demolition derby), might work better. That being said, the last 15 minutes of this film may be the greatest creation of Spielberg's career. I have come to admire this portion of AI tremendously. With the hindsight of knowing some of the jarring elements of the film's conclusion, one can be swept up in the achingly emotional reunion of mother and child. And that music! John Williams never wrote anything more beautiful.",A.I. Artificial Intelligence
269,SILENCEikillyou,Can't stop thinking about it!,10,21 June 2002,"What can I say?  If you can think like a child, this entire movie is a logical, as well as, an emotional journey.  David, having never been in the 'real' world loses his mother; I won't say how.  Anyone, man or machine, that lives in the mind of a child, raised on fairy tales would do the same thing:  Find the nearest fairy (Blue in this case).  The journey David undertakes is an adventure and his companions along the way are complex and intriguing.  Jude Law delivers a believable and real performance as Gigalo Joe.  He acts out the less advanced Mecha model of a lover robot to a T. Though he is supposed to be an adult, he behaves more like a child than the more advanced child robot supremely portrayed by Haley Osment.  I couldn't imagine a better suited duo in this epic Spielberg/Kubrick adventure. The first day I rented this was the first time I watched a movie back-to-back in the same night.  THEN, instead of returning it the next night, as usual, I watched it again, returned it then promptly went across the street from Blockbuster to KMart and bought the movie, only to watch it again the next day.  Can you say, 'obsession' boys and girls... I knew you could.  Its okay, I know you were thinking it.  I swear its never happened before.  And I'm not a die-hard Spielberg fan, but I like his movies.  I'm not a die-hard Kubrick fan... you get the idea.  I guess oppostites attract in this instance.  I highly recomend getting the DVD and watching ALL the extra stuff, especially the Portrait of David portion. P.S. I still haven't seen a H.J.

270,segacs,Extremely disappointing,3,5 February 2005,"I had gone to see A.I. with very high expectations, hoping to be not only entertained, but also intellectually stimulated. Unfortunately, neither happened.The movie started off with a very promising opening scene. The world set up in the movie is one where ""mecha"" - humanlike intelligent machines - are common, but often hated by humans. A team of scientists is interested in knowing whether a machine could be developed to love, like a real child, and whether people could love him back. Some of the initial issues brought up include what consists of humanity, whether machines can have feelings, whether they can love, and what responsibilities - if any - humans have towards machines. I was on the edge of my seat waiting to see how it would play out.Instead of a philosophical movie, however, A.I. gradually evolved into a long, run-on fairy tale loosely based on Pinocchio. David, the robot-child created to love, wants nothing more than to become a ""real boy"" so as to win the affection of his ""mother"". He sets off on a typical fairy-tale quest, with the goal of finding the Blue Fairy who can grant his wish. Along the way he makes a couple of friends to serve as sidekicks, and encounters obstacles and dangers. This is an all-too-common plot that really did not need three hours to unfold.One of the problems with this movie is that it unsuccessfully fused two divergent visions - one of the late Stanley Kubrick, whose brainchild the movie initially was - and the other of Steven Spielberg, who finished the project after Kubrick's death. The lavish, grandiose scenes are clearly Kubrick, with a bit of the Burton-esquire dark side, thrown in for good measure (I could almost swear Tim Burton had a hand in this movie, if I didn't know better). Especially the scenes of the flesh fairs and the machines searching for old parts are plenty dark and twisted.And then? Just as we expect the plot to heat up and eventually come to a climax - nothing. The break between Kubrick's and Spielberg's visions in this movie is clearly apparent. Spielberg attempts to turn this into another E.T. (what is it with those acronym titles, anyway?) but fails miserably. One scene leads into another, and another, and another. Each scene of the last hour or so of the movie could easily have been the last. It really should have ended long before it did. Because when it finally ended, the audience was left with . . . well, I'm not sure. There's no moral, no message, no underlying meaning, and seemingly no rhyme or reason for ending the movie the way it ended. The last hour just chugs along aimlessly until it breaks off awkwardly, without really saying anything.Not that everything was bad. There was some very good acting in this movie, and a cute talking teddy bear. However, these small things fail to redeem this mess.Again, it's another case of a real shame. Had A.I. dared to ask the big questions, it could have been one of the most intelligent and thought-provoking movies in a long time. But it didn't, so it wasn't. If you're looking for something interesting, pick up a copy of Ray Kurzweil's book ""The Age of Spiritual Machines"". A.I. doesn't even come close.",A.I. Artificial Intelligence

273,Tug-3,A frustrating masterpiece,7,2 July 2001,"There are spoilers in this review -- I have bracketed them with the word SPOILER in caps.There is one point of advice I must offer in this `review,' which could be construed as a spoiler. There is a point in the movie when your gut tells you `The movie is over,' and adds, `Wow.'  This is the point when you should get up and leave the theater.  Trust me.  Get up, leave the theater, and know that ignorance is bliss.  You have just watched two hours and ten minutes of beautiful, haunting filmmaking; you have seen the film Kubrick probably wanted to make.  Run.For most of the movie, the meshing of Spielberg's and Kubrick's styles is seamless.  References to films from both directors' opuses are plentiful: when David first enters his owners' house, he is haloed by light, an echo of the aliens' first appearance in Close Encounters. He mirrors his `mother' in scenes reminiscent of E.T.'s imitative behavior. He compulsively writes his thoughts in crayon on large sheets of paper, found by his mother in a scene that smacks of The Shining.  One scene must be an homage to 2001: David's `supertoy,' a talking teddy bear named (of course) Teddy, is passed from person to person in a crowd, saying in a deep, mechanical voice: `Are you taking me to David?  I must find David.  Where is David?'  This scene is a reminder that Kubrick had previously tackled issues of artificial intelligence - and that his take on the subject was hardly optimistic.The movie gets better as it goes along, .  The underwater scenes are indescribably beautiful and worth the price of admission.  I'm thinking: it just doesn't get any better than this.  I am enthralled.  And then comes the scene that should be the end.  I think: perfect.  What a movie.Roger Ebert said in his review: `When we lose a toy, the pain is ours, not the toy's, and by following an abandoned robot boy rather than the parents who threw him away, Spielberg misses the real story.'  At this scene, I could not have disagreed more with Ebert: David's story had become the perfect allegory for man's constant search for his creator, for our undying desire to be loved by our maker.  The scene where the movie should have ended is the perfect crystallization of this quest: [David looks into the face of `god' and begs, relentlessly and infinitely pleads, to be `real' and to be loved.]I'm thinking, Wow.  End now.  More movie?  Okay, doesn't seem to be the need, but okay.It's awful how this ending destroys everything that came before.  Until this point the movie is somber, thoughtful, wondrous, dark - a masterpiece. But that ending sticks out like a gangrenous thumb.There is plenty to admire about A.I.  Its special effects alone  earn it a special place in the pantheon of great science fiction movies. The acting is wonderful, especially from Haley Joel Osment, who manages to make David both endearing and creepy, using subtle mannerisms to remind us that he is not what he seems.  And best of all, the first two hours of A.I. raises questions that are impossible to answer and deals with them intelligently.  But if you go and stay until the ending credits, prepare to be frustrated and angry. For two hours, you've been watching a work that could be mentioned alongside 2001, Blade Runner, Metropolis, and Star Wars.  Then for thirty minutes you are served lukewarm Hook.",A.I.

274,bedazzle,ridiculously horrible ending,6,30 June 2001,"Interpretation, spoilers:A young boy is searching for what it means to be human, and in the end discovers that it is not love, but reciprocated love that makes one human. Like a structured film, this idea is stated in the very first scene, so there is no need for surprise.A view like this speaks of a secular view concerning humanness. Love is simply a series of electrical impulses; it does not matter whether these impulses are relayed organically or mechanically. Yet true love requires its potential to be loved in return to be fulfilled. A heart warming definition of ""human,"" just don't use it in any biological or artificial intelligence debates.What I have been speaking of amounts to the Spielberg side of the movie. The remaining majority left on the Kubrick side is the dark and pessimistic picture which dominates the movie. From the direction the movie was headed, I thought that the submerged and caged - yet hopeful - submarine would be the conclusive ending. Life, like love, is just material. Human life consists of denial of this fact, and as Camus put it, is ""absurd."" What is more absurd than waiting in a confined space for two thousand years for an inanimate object that common sense and reality tells you will only break if you ever reach it? This ending coincides with the flow of the movie and I enjoyed it. All joy was transformed into annoyance when the actual ending took place.The ending is not horrible because it is happy, it is horrible because it is a contrived happy ending on a sad movie - illustrating the Spielberg/Kubrick tension. The fact is that if the mother were brought back to life, she would be the same mother that lived 2000 years ago; she would not love him! She would be the same hateful, unremorseful person that had left him in the woods alone and teary-eyed. Waking up and finding him in her bedroom, she would have had yet another fit of hysterics and called the police.
But, the aliens could have, with all their superior powers, created a mother that would love him. In this case she would be another blue-fairy-like illusion and the moral would be that hope makes us human, not realized hope. It would be optimistically pessimistic, and importantly it would stay true to the script. The fact that this mother love was shown to be authentic is a travesty and emotional pandering.Kubrick would have had the courageous audacity to make a real boy of this artificial 'A.I. Artificial Intelligence.'",A.I. Artificial Intelligence
275,Laitue_Gonflable,"Superb, fascinating and unusual",9,7 September 2003,"Artificial Intelligence is like a multiple-walled room with doors on every wall, each door leading to a different destination. I use this simile simply because there are so many ways this film can be read, and indeed so many ways in which this film leads you. It takes you through each and every one of those doors and you have to decide in which destination you stay.Being the final working project of Kubrick, it obviously had high promise. The fact that Spielberg had to finish it off, obviously leads to disappointment. Not because Spielberg does a bad job- far from it- but because one can only speculate how much better Kubrick could have done.There are elements of both directors in the film: the first thirty minutes are very Spielberg, while from about thirty to ninety minutes the Kubrick influence is extremely strong, and this is definitely my favourite part of the film. It's dark and cynical and provides us with a world we are not accustomed to, and don't particularly want to be. While the first section dealt with the dream of a robot boy who could be taught to love, which is quite a corny and cliched concept, the second section deals with the harsh realities of the inferiority of robots and mankind's inability to accept and adjust to them, and their violent retaliations. The principle character, David, played astonishingly well by Haley Joel Osment, plays a key role in this section. Being young and innocent and carrying an animatronic teddy bear (arguably the greatest character in the film) wherever he goes, he embodies the naivety of your average child growing up in a terrifying world which he does not understand. But in this film, that real-life situation is explored to its extremes.David is helped along his way by another very likeable character, Gigolo Joe, one of Jude Law's most interesting performances. The interaction between the two is absolutely fascinating, almost absurdist at times and always with that quirky, Kubrickean feel to it. The quest that forms the central part of the film is essentially nothing more than an appropriation of the Pinocchio story, retold in a science-fiction context: David must become a real boy in order to gain the love of his mother. When he reaches Manhattan where his final destination is supposed to be but in actual fact finds him nowhere else but back at the manufacturer's where he was made, we think the film is over. But in actual fact there is about another hour to run.It is this last hour that is the most criticised, and it is quite clear why. There appears to be too much resolution to the film; there are three different points at which the film could end, and at only one of these it does. All three are very sad and tragic ends, but the third and actual ending is somehow the least fulfilling, it gives you a far more hollow feeling. At first I thought it was just because it is such a bleak portrayal but in actual fact it is simply because personally I felt one of the other two endings would be better, but maybe that's too conventional an outlook.The final resolution is something that has never been done before, in a way that has never been done. It's really unexpected and unpredictable, it deals with a bizarre concept in a very serious manner and essentially finishes for you a movie that one person could never make alone. It's one of the most original and thoughtful endings of all time and really gets you thinking. It is so evident that so many minds and so many hours went into the crafting of this modern masterpice that you have to appreciate it. The film borders on being silly so often but never quite falls into that trap (I'm still not sure why) and for that I am forever grateful.Overall - ****1/2 / *****",A.I. Artificial Intelligence

Monica and Henry begin to give David less attention. Martin then talks David into doing things that a normal trouble maker would do and eventually that ends up to where Monica takes David out to the forest and purposley leaves him there.While in the forest, David discovers that he isn't the only robot living out there. When all of the robots in his path are kidnapped, including him, they are taken to a gigantic city in the 21st century where David meets Gigolo Joe (Jude Law), a man who gives women pleasure. David and Joe escape the horrors of the city show where robots are destroyed. David then finds out from a computer professor that the blue fairy can help show him his way home. So David and Joe go on a quest to find the blue fairy and put David back with his family.Their journey lasts for quite a while, in fact, David learns about himself along the way and begins to discover that he isn't real and that he's just a toy.Listen for voices from: Robin Williams, Meryl Streep, Chris Rock.A.I.

279,roystephen-81252,The very essence of being human,10,13 February 2016,"I am a big fan of Spielberg's work and though nowadays he is often criticised for his shamelessly tear-jerking sentimentalism, I've never seen that as a problem. It's just a sign of the times, I guess, people leaning towards dark, disturbing, gritty movies and being way too harsh with emotionally charged ones. I personally feel if a movie like A.I. does not move you to your very last cells, then something is deeply wrong with your human capacities.A.I. is a real tear-jerker, in the best possible sense. Spielberg has always had exceptional skills in eliciting great performances from child actors but what Haley Joel Osment does here is simply amazing. For me, it's right up there with the very best performances in the history of cinema. But Frances O' Connor, Jude Law and William Hurt give equally strong performances, as well.Visually, Spielberg superbly recreates Kubrick's idiosyncratic style, especially in the first third of the movie. From lighting and camera angles (Janusz Kaminski's outstanding cinematography, his best to date) through the ominous atmosphere created by John Williams's perfect score (one of his very best, as well) to Kubrick's trademark, highly symmetrical framing, it really feels like watching a Kubrick picture.Curiously, I am not really fond of the second act (the Flesh Fair scene and Dr. Know), but the rest is so strong that I tend to forgive and forget. The visual effects are just jaw-droppingly flawless. I'd easily say they still haven't been matched in any film. But it's ultimately the sheer emotional power that makes A.I. one of the best SF movies ever made. For me, it is Spielberg's greatest film and an all-time Top 10 contender, in general.",A.I.

280,Rhino Rover,acting was fantastic but story....,7,14 July 2001,"This was one of the more anticipated movies to come out this summer. Partly because of the fact that it was directed by Steven Spielberg but also partly because of the concept. It also helped that it was a Stanley Kubrick story, which have always been somewhat off beat, controversial and thought provoking. What was this reviewer's impression?The world is heading at breakneck speed towards artificial intelligence. We've seen this for years and it's always been a goal of science to be able to bridge the organic human to the artificial human. For what purpose? To understand humanity perhaps or for financial gain or even arrogance? This movie shows what it may look like if artificial intelligence came to fruition and the affects that it may have on humanity. The story revolves around a robot boy, David (Haley Joel Osment) that his creator made in what was basically a test to see if humans could actually feel emotions towards an artificial being. What results is a journey that not only the human parents travel but David travels as well. They learn things about themselves, each other and society but in the end, it is David comes out with the mostor does he?If for nothing else, see this movie just to see Osment's performance. I saw him in `Sixth Sense' and thought he was fantastic but there was a part of me that was wondering if he could only show a minimal range of emotions, mainly fright and terror. Boy was I wrong. Osment's performance in A.I. was phenomenal. Not to knock the other actors in this movie but Osment carried this film, which is quite a task if you think about it. Most films usually have 2 or more ADULT actors that share the load, typically a protagonist and an antagonist but this movie really revolved around Osment's character and his experiences as an artificial intelligence. He showed a tremendous range and surprised me quite a few times, leaving me amazed at how talented he is at such a young age. The only thing that I hope does not happen is that he burns out before he reaches 18 or that he succumbs to the temptations of fame like alcohol or drugs but seeing the level of maturity that he exhibits on interviews, I don't think this will happen. Jude Law is also quite good in this movie but Osment overshadows him quite often. Law's character is thought provoking though when you think about the occupation that his character has (male escort). However, there is a very heavy `Pinocchio' element to this movie, partly because the story weaves itself with the fairy tale but also because of the nature of the story. In a way, I didn't really like it, as it just seemed to me at certain points that this was just an updated/futuristic version of the fairy tale, maybe even lacking in creativity. The movie was long and the ending I thought was a bit over done. There was a certain point that I thought would have been a fantastic way to end the movie but it would have meant that Hollywood would have to break one of it's cardinal rules; having a happy ending. This seems to be a big crutch that Hollywood seems to lean on and I'm willing to bet that there would be a bigger appreciation for movies if they stepped out of those restraints once in a while and had a controversial or sad ending. The ending in this movie seemed to well wrapped it and showed that Hollywood had a big say in how it `should' end and not how the story was `supposed' to end. Overall, see this movie just to see the kid act. It is a bit long and a little weird but you should find it thought engaging nonetheless.",A.I. Artificial Intelligence

The film starts out as a somewhat compelling story but quickly dissipates into a ridiculous plot involving a robotic male prostitute and robots being shot out of cannons. When the film concentrates on the boy's quest for an organic nature, it's fine, and the ending actually is very good. But the majority of the film is stupid, silly, carnival-like and a waste of time.

With help from the late Stanley Kubrick (who worked on the project years before he died)Spielberg has made a masterpiece. The story of the central character who feels out of place in the world is not unfamiliar to the director, but here he adds a sting to the tale. It's a robot boy, David,who has been made for one reason and that is to love those who look after him. This being his 'parents' who adopt him after their own son is being kept frozen after an accident. The film beautifully portrays the adventures of this strange boy using trademark Spielberg lighting, the heartwrenching music by John Williams and the performances of the lead actors. It's a bold movie with so much to take from it. And as Davids journey progresses, so do our hearts and in the end, they might aswell explode. Fantastic in every sense.",A.I. Artificial Intelligence
284,Nigel St. Buggering,An extremely strange experience,8,1 July 2001,"""AI"" comes across as a bizarre little hybrid; as if a Kubrick film and a Spielberg film got together and had an illegitimate child.  This is clearly unlike any other Spielberg work to date.  Only occasionally do we see his style peek through.  This lends a certain uneasiness to the film.  There are no two directors whose approaches are more diametrically opposed, and the fusion seems uncomfortable.  This may just be a strength in a story that doesn't provide easy answers to its questions, or even definitively state what those questions are.As others have written, Haley Joel Osment is eerily perfect, and proves that his performance in ""The Sixth Sense"" was no fluke.  Whoever is choosing this kid's projects deserves an award of their own.  Jude Law is also excellent in his limited role, giving us a character who literally perceives everything through the limits of his programming.Visually, this is the most striking science fiction film since ""Blade Runner"".  More than simply convincing effects, these are convincing and real worlds, showcasing an incredible breadth of imagination.  And of course, Spielberg being Spielberg, he can't completely absorb himself in Kubrick's style, and there is some genuine emotion to be had.All of this makes it all the more jarring when the third act comes along. I'll try not to spoil anything here.  First of all, was narration necessary? There is no narrator in the first two acts, which makes his presence in the third intrusive and annoying.  It made me feel insulted; did they think we couldn't figure out what was happening?  But this is a small complaint, really.  The real problem is that the story runs miles for a conclusion that was inches away.  Nearly half an hour is spent setting up a situation that could have been provided quite easily within the confines of the original situation.  I can't get more specific than that without ruining anything, but believe me: it's a long way to go for closure.All in all, this is a visionary film that demands to be seen in a theater. It is challenging, intelligent, real science fiction.  In an age when science fiction in Hollywood means gunfights and chase scenes, this work deserves to be celebrated.  Its potential perfect score is marred only by its directionless final act: 8.As a final note to parents: please don't be fooled by the ads.  This is in no way, shape, or form a children's movie.  Get a babysitter, and see it on your own.  You'll thank yourselves later.",A.I. Artificial Intelligence
285,impendingdd,Criminally underrated fairytale film,10,21 March 2020,"This is a magical film by Spielberg. I can't imagine anyone other than Osment playing the role of a young robot child, he absolutely nails it. The film is a rather ominous yet beautiful tale with great performances, a terrific score, and impressive CGI for 2001. It's truly a classic not spoken about enough. It's heart felt, horrific, funny at times, and overall epic. If you love futuristic movies, post apocalyptic movies, AI movies, or fairy tale movies and haven't seen this you're missing out. It's truly unique.",A.I. Artificial Intelligence
286,Baldach,The robot Teddy Bear was the most interesting character.Spoilers,3,10 June 2002,"After a year of waiting I finally saw this movie on the cable channel. I was severly disappointed. I thought this movie might be simliar to classic Issac Asimov's ""I,Robot"" where a robot seeks to become human. Instead I watched a futuristic science fiction version of ""Pinnochio"". The simliars abound between A.I. and the Disney's ""Pinochio"": robot instead of a marionette, a robotic teddy bear instead of Jimmy Cricket, the robot creator instead of Geppeto, and Joe Gigolo instead of Pinnochio street wise companion 'Lampblack'(sorry I am unsure of the name).  The robot Teddy Bear was the most interesting character to me. This robot Teddy Bear stated the obvious throughout the movie such 'I don't know if you should do that David'. Spoiler alert ahead.   Finally on the ending, I thought the movie should have ended 20 minutes before it did with David the robot trapped with no obvious means of escape. The ending that Spielberg directed was the same style of Stanley Kubrick's ""2001"" cryptic ending. I felt the Spielberg honoring Kubrick at the ended was the least he could have done.",A.I. Artificial Intelligence
287,San Franciscan,"I haven't cried this hard watching a movie since ""Titanic"".",10,5 July 2001,"I haven't really enjoyed Spielberg's output since ""E.T."", really. I liked ""The Goonies"" for its mindless fun, but everything else just got more and more snores from me. I was beginning to think that ""E.T."" was some sort of a fluke.But with this film, Spielberg had a fantastic writer to work in collaberation with: the talented Stanley Kubrick. And I never would have guessed that he of all people could produce a story to move me so deeply.This isn't really science fiction so much as it is a hi-tech fairy tale (like ""Star Wars""). Put all expectations for logic and the like out to pasture and expect the innocence of a traditional children's story in terms of the storytelling and you'll be swept away by it.I was constantly wiping my eyes and blowing my nose throughout this film. It's true that the main character is a machine, but (as old stiffs like Roger Ebert can't get, as is proven by his own essay on this piece) the point here is that this is a machine that really CAN feel. And that machine, David, is used as a metaphor for so many things that are important to us as human beings that we don't get to enjoy or think about very much most of the time due to hectic everyday life. He's a reminder of the things that really are the most precious and priceless.I'm not going to take a chance of spoiling a bit of this film by describing it any further. I'll just say that it is easily a heartbreakingly beautiful film. It also has a score which is even prettier than ""E.T.""'s, sounding almost like a more deeply realized version of it. For pete's sake, just listening to the SCORE makes me cry (I bought it the second I got out of the theater).It's also touching, in a way, to see this film because it gives the impression that Spielberg has come full circle. Here we are, twenty years after ""E.T."" and we have another classic in its genre.Easily the best motion picture I've seen so far this year, I highly recommend it to anyone with a heart and an imagination.",A.I.

288,director9ff,Some is confusing...,8,18 July 2001,"This is a very good film. Unlike other films, it can take a story that everyone loves (Pinocchio), and makes it original using a new setting, time, or whatever (in this case, it is time).(Note: The Following paragraph has spoilers. If I couldn't ruin film endings, parts would be unexplained. It is neccesary, but only read if you don't want to see the film, or have already seen it.)However, every film I have seen probably has a flaw. This one has more than one. For example, it seems like, at the end, the thing that David is in lasts about two days (might be incorrect). If the aliens can resurrect things only for a day, then how can Teddy be there for nearly all the time? Also, what were the aliens for? There is no hint to their existence in the film (minus the ending), so why couldn't robots have found him? Or something that was hinted at in the film? Also, wouldn't the helicopter that David saw the Blue fairy in have deteriorated over 2000 years? Wouldn't have David's battery died? What about Teddy? (See the David's battery issue.) Why weren't the David and Sheila models released? I could go on, but the online service would shut down.(Spoiler over)What the point is would be that, though the film is good, there are plot holes the size of the film reel that it was projected on.

289,IOBdennis,Not science fiction or fact--a fairy tale! CONTAINS A SPOILER,10,30 January 2002,"This is truly an amazing film.  What seemingly starts off to be a science fiction story about a robot, given human characteristics, turns into a Pinocchio-like fairy tale.  I know many critics have blamed this film for doing exactly that:  switching gears, as it were, mid-stream.  However, I didn't see it that way at all.  Knowing beforehand that this was going to be a fairy tale from the beginning made the picture all the more poignant and telling.The filming is superb.  The film, I mean the actual visuals, has texture, feeling to it!  Each section of the film has a different ""feel"" to it, making it interesting.  From the opening almost Rembrandt-like sepia-toned Operating Room in which a specimen is being examined to the expansive aquamarine, underwater Coney Island scene, this film is incredible visually. The return to the intimate living pod at the end of the film is also breath-taking with its narrator, soothingly wrapping up the story in a happily-ever-after setting is haunting.  The set for the living quarters, by the way, is reminiscent of the house in ""A Clockwork Orange.""  So much of this film is suggestive of other Spielberg/Kubrick films.  Oh yes, and of course there's that ending, the beings from another planet, Time Beings, whatever!  But if you look at it from the fairy tale point of view, every fairy tale has a deus ex machina in it.  David thinks it's The Blue Fairy, and in one sense it is, but then because The Blue Fairy is really only a statue, the true ""saviors"" arrive and he can ""live"" happily ever after. All of the acting in this film is top notch.  Haley Joel Osment is truly remarkable.  In the beginning of the film, he captures what being a boy-like robot must be.  He has just enough of the ""robotic"" character and the right mix of boy-like characteristics to be truly convincing in this role.  Jude Law is amazing in the role of Gigolo Joe.  He has a robotic amorality to him with a touch of Gene Kelly (did the programmers of Gigolo Joe do that intentionally?) that make him interesting and remarkable.This is truly one of the great movies of all time, and it is, indeed, a fine tribute to an incredibly gifted film maker by yet another.",A.I.

It also makes you think. In fact, the first hour of this film is very deep - very thought provoking. But then it gradually loses its way.

When movies try to tackle moral dilemmas of the future I am usually intrigued, but this movie fell flat on its face in trying to do so.  This could have been another Gattaca, which dealt with the potential discrimination issues involved with genetic profiling.  Considering that this next century will likely be the century of gene, Gattaca's importance will be seen in a clear light within the next 20 years.  In AI, however, Spielberg decided to throw some pathetic Pinocchio fairy tale in the mix.  This could have been a fascinating moral study with amazing characters, but... oh forget it.I would be very interested to know what parts were Kubrick's and what parts were Spielberg's.  I bet it was Spielberg that threw the fairy tale in the middle OR Kubrick realized the inherent failure in the story and never finished it.  Considering Kubrick's prowess, there is likely a reason he tinkered with it for so long.  I am very glad he didn't live to see this and I wish his name wouldn't be associated with this catastrophic flop.

Yes the movie was too sappy (I cry every time I watch it) yes there was no need for a gigolo robot and a giant city of sex. Yes there were plot holes.But overall, if you look at what was accomplished, this movie is a masterpiece, of technical work, imagination, and design, that is truly amazing. The story is also heavily ripped from Pinnocio and the Wizard of Oz too, but OK.I didn't find out until the third time watching this that the 'aliens' at the end are actually the evolutions of the robots. The dna nonsense was a bit stretched. It would have been nice to see more robots fighting back, aren't there any soldier robots? You bet we would build those first. According to Spielberg, this world is on the verge of civil war between robots and humans, yet we see no trace of the robots even thinking of fighting back. I'm thinking it will be armies of David's and Darlenes doing the fighting, so maybe show that. They are letting loose an assembly line of dangerous unstable robots at the end of the movie (as David's rage incident with one of his product line shows clearly) yet we do not see the outcome.I guess the depth and beauty and wonder of this new world Spielberg created for me drew me in so completely that I was left wanting it all, wanting to know all, and for the movie to never end.",A.I.

294,L. Lion,true artifice,5,1 July 2001,"In a summer of wearisome cookie-cutter action FX schlock, AI rises above the ashes by presenting a truly troubling future world wound around the story of a young robot that has been programmed to love, but is not loved in return. David is a mecha, a mechanical being created with a special ability to truly love his 'orga' (organic being) mother and father.  He will be an answer to the many families that are not allowed children in a future of diminishing prosperity and possibility.  A test subject, he is placed with a family where the mother is grief stricken over the loss of her son, who has been frozen while they seek a cure for his cancer.  David enters the family, wins acceptance and love, and then is eventually rejected and thrown out into the world.  The rejection is not one of cruelty - it is caused by several misunderstandings after the real son is cured.  His quest to win the love of the 'Mommy' that rejected him is the core of his wanderings.Steven Spielberg, directing material prepared by the late Stanley Kubrick, is a master of manipulating audience emotion.  Usually he is helped by the material, whether it be lost aliens on Earth, Indiana Jones, dinosaurs running amock, or something as serious as the holocaust.  Kubrick is the opposite:  a master at pointing out the farcicality of life and making us question our beliefs.  The result of this melange of creators is troubling and thought-provoking, but emotionally unsatisfying.  Spielberg produces moments of strong emotional impact, but is not allowed payoff (except in the most artificial way).  He has saddled himself with a story that can have no happy ending, and because the character cannot learn from his yearnings, he has no 'arc'.A dramatic arc is what a character must pass through on the way to evolving into someone better, more mature.  In a film about an ordinary child rejected by his mother, the arc would be that child's eventual understanding and acceptance about his own faults and those of his mother's that caused the rift, his forgiveness of his mother, and his getting on with his own life.  In the case of David, you have emotionally a vehicle like the Terminator.  He will not stop seeking a way to earn the love of his mother no matter what, even if she is dead, and he cannot or will not learn from what life is teaching him.  In many ways this quest is hardwired into all of us - no one wants to be rejected by their mother - but his inability to transcend this dilemma makes him an empty vehicle for an audience to follow. The answer in the end for this film is an artificial one, although it is provided in a very thought-provoking and disturbing context regarding the future of humanity.The technical aspects of the film are extraordinary, and Spielberg has created an evocative and interesting future world with a drowned Manhattan and places like Rouge City.  The only section that really did not work for me was the Flesh Faire, where blood-mad humans cheer the destruction of mechanical men.  The acting is very good, especially Haley Joel Osment as David and Frances O'Connor as his 'mother' Monica, who have a wrenching scene of child abandonment in the woods.  Jude Law is unsatisfying as Gigolo Joe - as a mecha he can only have so much volition, and it comes and goes in spurts.  I thought he captured the role of the loverboy robot well, but it felt like that role had never really been formed in the context of David's quest.  Joe can add neither true information or direction for David, just a road map to the next scene.  Spielberg's ability to create delightful fairy-tale creations comes across in Teddy, an animatronic walking Teddy Bear who manages to add gravity and support to David's quest.  Forever supportive, never intrusive and never dumb, he is the perfect sidekick.  He even stitches himself back up if his fur has been damaged.I have several complaints about the technical aspects of the film's plot, however.  In once scene David damages himself by eating spinach.  Since we see him immersed in water several times, it is apparent that he is capable of ingesting that and not being damaged.  Why would spinach hurt him? Furthermore, if you are going to make a mecha as much like a human as possible, wouldn't it make sense if his mouth is going to lead to his insides to create a place for food to go, should he ingest it, and a spigot out so he can expel it?The second major point is the motivations for the mechas.  By now Asimov's laws of robotics are known and accepted (robots shall not hurt humans etc.) Are these mechas not programmed this way?  Gigolo Joe is forced to go on the run after he is implicated in a murder where the murderer confesses the crime in front of him.  Isn't his robot brain recording everything?  Won't it become evidence in the trial of the true murderer?  Isn't Joe hardwired to call the cops upon seeing a crime and standing by to give assistance in any way possible?  Wouldn't that make more sense?I have seen AI once and will not see it again.  A Spielberg film you see for bang and the emotional fulfillment.  A Kubrick film you watch in order to ponder the implications and laugh in retrospect over the farce that is life. This film neither really delivers on either end, it is often static, and I felt unsatisfied watching it.  But I do urge anyone to see it who has not, simply to support something with a brain and an effort to inform.  Noble purposes deserve their support, too.",A.I. Artificial Intelligence

296,mpofarrell,A Fascinating Misfire,6,15 March 2004,"A.I. ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE is Steven Spielberg's most problematical film. Originally the brainchild of the late Stanley Kubrick , Spielberg took over writing and directing responsibilities after Kubrick's untimely passing in the spring of 1999. Years before Kubrick had read Brian Aldiss' Sci-fi short story SUPERTOYS LAST ALL SUMMER LONG , a futuristic tale of a grieving couple who 'adopt' a robotic boy in order to assuage the pain of losing their natural born son who lies in a coma and is confined to a cryogenic capsule until a cure can be found for his terminal condition. Set in the not-too-distant-future, in a world overrun by massive flooding due to global warming , strict family planning is enforced to modify the world population. Robots , or Mechas , become an increasingly large part of the population , serving in various capacities as domestic servants. When a brilliant scientist creates a new prototype, a robot that possesses tactile feelings and human emotions, trouble ensues. Film critics seemed to be split down the middle in assessing A.I. : they either loved it or hated it. The movie-going public had a more immediate response. The movie was one of Spielberg's rare financial failures. A.I. has the unmistakable look of a Kubrick film with its often symmetrically composed images, a hypnotic slightly futuristic music score reminiscent of 2001 and a cold, somewhat sterile set design that evokes his famous space epic and A Clockwork Orange. The film's visual effects are astonishing, particularly in a climactic sequence when Haley Joel Osment's robotic boy (an eerily effective performance) searches the ocean floor of a sunken metropolis in search of an unusual mother surrogate. A.I. falters badly when it tries to incorporate the famous Pinocchio fairy tale into its story : it's a clumsy device that simply doesn't work, although it does afford some oddly fascinating special effects.Although A.I. is a failure, it is not an ignoble one. There are images in this movie that are hard to shake, and despite its clumsy storytelling devices, the movie manages to convey a sad, eerie power.",A.I. Artificial Intelligence
297,Doogie D,I take it back,8,2 July 2001,"I'm posting second thoughts; I hope folks will forgive my indulgence.What I had written before was that the last minutes of the film were so bad, Spielberg should be punished.  Not only is a comment like that not cool, but it ignores just how terrific the rest of the film is.  A second viewing confirmed it, and I've re-rated this one as an 8/10.A.I. is absolutely packed with thought provoking ideas.  There are a couple of missteps besides the very bad final minutes -- there's no explanation of why Gigolo Joe would be implicated in the murder, for instance -- but the story itself is fairly thrilling.  It felt, in its way, like THE WIZARD OF OZ -- a road trip movie.  And Kubrick -- a professed atheist -- might disagree, but it seems to me that the film is saying that if we kill off our fairy tales (e.g. God), why would we need our souls?  And as our souls, starved, die off, we will die as well, and the next step of evolution will be the artificial intelligence we leave behind.  And, as they continue to evolve, they will long for the souls we have discarded.  In a sense, what's the point of having a soul if there's no heaven?Perhaps Kubrick would have liked to have been a machine.  There's little doubt that the creator of the Star Child and the surviving mechas would have liked to be part of the next generation, so to speak.  But here at the end of his life, he finally contributed to a soulful production indeed.  It's a little messy, but people are only human, right?",A.I. Artificial Intelligence
298,Doogie D,Spielberg shoots himself in the foot,8,30 June 2001,"I wavered between giving A.I. a 6 or a 7, finally deciding on a 6 because Spielberg needs to be punished.  Seriously.The film is inventive and packed with ideas, whatever its flaws.  The real betrayal has been commented upon elsewhere, and I'll repeat it here:A.I. has three opportunities to close.  The first ending -- the narration over the Ferris wheel -- would have been terrific, however grim, and the audience could have left satisfied and tantalized, if a little glum.  At that point, the film -- warts and all -- would have been thought-provoking, evocative, and even mythical.But it keeps going.  Again, it could have ended when a statue shatters; not as good an ending as before, but a halfway decent crescendo which still would have had some resonance thematically.And it keeps going.  Now we're in the realm of total grafting and adolescent science in which, by God, we're going to get SOMETHING of a happy ending, however slim.With that, the increasingly creaky contraption breaks down and sputters out, wooden Oedipal overtones and all.  Spielberg betrays his story and audience. This is one of those films in which, when it ends, the audience can't get out of their seats fast enough.  At the screening I attended, half of us were on our feet when the director's credit came on.I may well buy the DVD when it's released, watch the movie and shut it off when its proper time comes.  What will gnaw at me, however, is knowing there's that appendage on there -- a sixth toe I'm trying to ignore -- and I wish, like Kubrick -- that Spielberg would have the courage to lop off what's unnecessary even after it's in the theaters.By God, sir, I will not abide another toe.",A.I.

299,watto124,Spielberg Sentimentality strikes again! (unfortunately),8,30 June 2001,"Although Spielberg did a great job on the film and the film itself is great, I found the movie to be too long, badly edited, and way too sentimental. There's just not enough Kubrick, and too much Spielberg. Don't get me wrong, the movie does have its share of great Kubrickian scenes. I just can't help but feel Spielberg didn't know where to go with this project. *MAY BE SOME SPOILERS* The acting is great. Haley Joel Osment once again does a great job, Jude Law almost steals the movie, and the rest of the cast is brilliant. The movie is also a wonder to look at with its surreal, beautiful, and colorful imagery. Some provocative ideas and poignant scenes make the film also an emotional trip. But this is where it all falls apart. The film becomes too hip for its own good. A ROBOT! Come on! We understand that we need emotional material but not this too much. The last 20 minutes desperately needed to be cut down. Kubrick would have had the film much more enigmatic and thought-provoking. He would have had less talk and more visual storytelling techniques like in ""2001: A Space Odyssey"". It's a shame ol' Stanley couldn't make this picture.

This movie basically had the same plot as last years Bicentennial Man and that movie did not fair well with critics but after seeing both movies I liked Bicentennial Man much better.  There were so many scenes that I just cringed at.  I felt like I had pins jabbed into my brain and eyeballs watching this movie.On the positive side, I will say that Osment did a good job in acting. And I liked the Teddy Bear. That's as far as I will go.  The problem was the movie.If you want to go see a movie and feel depressed than go see this.  I would go on and tell you about some of the things I disliked but would I be giving away spoilers?  Here's some - without spoiling the movie.  I'll start with the Flesh Fair.

302,tallguy62,"The ""serious"" Spielberg bombs out AGAIN!",1,10 August 2007,"Let's face it. Spielberg, as a director, is generally lousy at making serious movies, partly because he fills them with so much sentimental slop. This movie tries to be emotional and fails abysmally at all levels. (Similarly, many posters on this site who saw War of the Worlds also were appalled at Spielberg's apparent lack of ability to make us feel any emotions for THOSE characters, either, particularly Tom Cruise). Part of the problem is that the film, as a whole, is so sadly lacking in continuity that the viewer gets lost in the mishmash of scenes and characters. None of it came together or made sense.The first half of the movie, the viewer is led to believe that this movie has something to do with families and family relations, love, etc. OK, I can buy that. The problem is that approximately half way through the film, the filmmakers ""pull the rug out from under the viewer"", so to speak, and send the storyline careening off in a completely different direction from the first half. NO explanation is given for this lack of insight or continuity -- the viewer is simply supposed to continue watching. As viewers, though, we get lost. The family is all of a sudden completely OUT of the movie. Why did we waste the first half then on something that would be meaningless? The last hour and a half of the film, the storyline spins out of control in all directions. It is as if Spielberg intentionally wants to confuse, annoy, irritate and befuddle the viewer. I was wondering, what in the world is this movie about, anyway? I'm not certain I have ever figured it out. Then, you get to the end and it is a real stinker. Let's feel bad for some little robot-boy that we were made not to care about for the previous 5/6ths of the movie. What?? If I wanted a film with no storyline, I would rent ""Open Water"" again.

Francis O'Connor is also good as the robot boy's mother.  And Jude Law is a delight as the sex robot. As for the plot, it is somewhat schizophrenic and disjointed but not entirely without merit (Spielberg was forced to cut many expository scenes to reduce the running time to a reasonable period). ***Warning*** SPOILERS coming.  I would have liked to see a better motivation for Francis O'Connor's love of the boy plus her abandonment of him.  Also, the death of one of Jude Law's customers is not clearly explained.

305,alsation72,"Artificial Intelligence? Artificial maybe, but incredibly stupid!",4,1 November 2013,"So much pulp has been added to the crisp simple premise of the short story it probably didn't need to credit Aldiss at all.Though Osment does a superb job as usual (why isn't he getting more work today???) the unfortunate fact is that this story is incredibly illogical. The ""blue fairy""? Seriously? The boy android goes in search of a blue fairy for a large chunk of the film, a mirror to the Pinocchio plot. Somehow this ""intelligent"" android believes he can be turned into a real human boy by a fairy. It is a ludicrous, silly plot device.Amazing to think that in 2001 they actually believed the internet would disappear to be replaced with some holographic wizard charging money to answer some questions. Again, just plain stupid. My ancient Sony laptop has wi-fi yet apparently this technology will disappear.Another flaw in the logic of this story is the idea that sea levels will rise and completely inundate New York city with ice. If the Antarctic continent, Greenland, and every glacier melted on this planet, sea levels would rise around 70-75 metres. This would not have been too hard to find out surely.In the short story the married couple win a licence to allow them to conceive, whereas the film has a boy around ten years old who is cured of an illness and comes out of a coma. Apparently he's right up to date with technology though and has a gaggle of friends who materialise.The android boy of the story is belligerent but tries to express how much he loves his ""mother"" ... in the film the ""mother"" reads a silly code to make the android love her (creepy in itself): was this necessary? Why would they make an orifice that can ingest food that will ruin the internals? And why then doesn't the dip in the pool do similar damage?One more thing and then I'm done (promise). Are we really to believe that humans will in the future find the destruction of obsolete technology to be so thoroughly entertaining? Dumb, dumb, dumb! Maybe I'll smash up my old Commodore 64 with a mallet ... would a stadium of people really be interested?For me this movie was entertaining to the point of the blue fairy nonsense. Its projections of the future are largely absurd and it is almost as bad as that abomination with Robin Williams, ""Bicentennial Man"".",A.I. Artificial Intelligence
306,BlackBalloon,Wonderful,10,8 July 2001,"A.I. is in an awkward position as a film.  With two big director's names attached to it (one of whom was dead during all principal photography and editing), it is bound to be heavily, even brutally, criticized.  Kubrick fans may find it too warm and fuzzy for their tastes and at the same time, it may be just too plain weird for mainstream American audiences.A.I. is a portrait of the inevitable- machines becoming more and more like us, our relationships with them becoming even more intimate.  To what extent A.I. presents this future accurately (as far as details are concerned) is irrelevant, because the basic philosophical issues are there.  Spielberg presents a world that has a love-hate relationship with machines.  At turns they are portrayed as expensive toys for Jetsons-age yuppies and pariahs of working-class rednecks.(SPOILERS)  The juxtaposition of mechas and the advancement of medical and biological science (a key character is resurected via cryogenics, someone is cloned, etc.), which is machinery in its own right, hints the question of ""what is 'real'""?  The last half hour has been criticized for being implausible, but if you have ever loved and been loved, it will touch you deeply.  Not only that, but I believe it holds the key to the deepest mystery of the movie- what is the meaning of finite existence?  For being thought-provoking, entertaining, beautiful, and more human than any movie I've seen in a long time, A.I. gets 10 out of 10 stars from me.",A.I. Artificial Intelligence
307,AdFin,The definitive A.I. review,10,24 March 2002,"The idea of Steven Spielberg delivering Stanley Kubrick's long in gestation epic A.I. (Artificial Intelligence) was always going to result in an odd hybrid of a movie.  But at its core, A.I. delivers both the warmness of a Spielberg film, and just the right amount of Kubrickian detachment to make the story work.  The film expertly sets up the theme of Robotic rebellion and their lack of understanding with the first scene, showing professor Hobby (William Hurt) conducting a talk about the creation of artificial life, after pricking a `mecha' with a pin, professor Hobby asks the machine how she feels about what has just happened.  The machine is polite and accommodating, not really sure of what is going on, when Hobby speaks of love, the machine can only translate the intimacy of love, not the act it's self.  This then leads us to the introduction of David (Osment), the first robot boy, capable of expressing the love of a real child.  The first act now begins and we see David slowly inducted into the Swinton family, originally a replacement for their real son, who languishes in cryogenics until a cure for his illness can be found.  But once the son is fit to come home, the Swinton's are faced with the problem of having two children, both fighting over the attention of their mother, one blinded by jealousy, the other blinded by love.  Once the mother has abandoned David in the words, the film moves into act two, in which the brightness and optimism of act one slowly becomes a darker and more mechanical pessimism.  The climax of act one shows us that it is human error that is causing the problems in society, whereas the parents abandon David because of his failings, because he is a robot, the robots continue the function, because they are programmed to regardless of what happens.  It is from this that the Pinocchio quest begins, and Spielberg expertly draws parallels with the story of the wooden boy searching for the blue fairy to make him real, with the story of a Robotic boy trapped in the same situation.  This also helps set up the conscience of the film, in the character of Teddy, a supper toy.  It's no surprise that Spielberg (and Kubrick) decided on the Pinocchio element, because David is programmed to think like a child, and it is only natural that he would identify his very real situation with something more aching to fantasy, something that Freud believed in strongly.  Children watch cartoons and read fairytales because they give the child hope; it's also a way of telling very dark stories in a lighter way.  The use of Pinocchio is a clever devise as the story is really a metaphor for coming of age, and loss of innocence, which is what is at the forefront of A.I.  This loss of innocence also sets up the character of Gigolo Joe (Law), a pleasure robot who joins David on his quest, a character who fills David in on the ways of Human law and their feelings about robot kind.  When Joe and David find themselves rounded up at the flesh fair, act two takes on a much darker tone.  It is here that we get the first look at human error in its fullest form, as robots are slaughtered for the entertainment of humans.  It is only after one human believes David to be a real boy that pandemonium breaks out, the message being that the humans are only interested in their own kind.  As David and Joe quest to Rouge City to find the blue fairy, the origins of David become more clear, and it is only when we begin to make sense of the whole situation that the film spirals into a third act that comes right out of nowhere.David, with the knowledge that he is not the original he thought he was, lies at the bottom of the ocean for two thousand years, his blue fairy a statue at a fairytale amusement park, flooded like the rest of Manhattan. It is here that Spielberg's film takes a bizarre turn that it almost doesn't recover from.  The sight of the alien beings subtracts the humanity of David's quest, taking away the humanity he had developed over the course of the film.  This is also the part of the film that is so obviously trying to be 2001: A Space Odyssey, as the aliens recreate David's adopted home, and give him the chance to see his mother once again is almost like Bowman travelling through the star gate and finding himself in the huge house.  But it is from this that we must remember that David is a child, that one day with his mother is worth more than anything else to him, and it is also important to think of the possibility that the entire third act could be taking place in David's imagination, as he lies at the bottom of the ocean, slowly shutting down due to the harsh conditions.  This would explain the almost fairytale reprise of the narrator (Ben Kingsley), and the strong sentiment of David's perfect day.  A lot of people have expressed great hatred to this ending, words like schmaltzy and copout have been thrown around, and it only highlights a noticeable parallel between them, and the humans of A.I., have audiences become so nihilistic that they root for a child (admittedly a robotic child) to be destroyed, and to have his wish go unfulfilled.  The ending of the film beautifully nurtures the notion of undying, unconditional love between parent and child, as David's dream of a lifetime with his mother has been granted, even if it means he must lay in the bed for another two-thousand years.  A.I. may be an odd hybrid, and it may not have been the film that Kubrick envisioned, but it is definitely a greatly underrated film that has been criticized by talent-less critics who have no real ammo to back up their argument.",A.I.

308,LongTimeMovieLover,When Kubrick is Not Kubrick,6,7 April 2019,"Kubrick was a genius. Spielberg is a genius. But, they are different types of geniuses and they don't mix or match. No genius can do it the same way, which is why the person is a genius. They best you can do is get another genius that has a similar thematic view.Kubrick's clever dark philosophical view simply does not match with Spielberg's common mass entertainment view. Spielberg was simply the wrong genius to complete the work. All of Kubrick's later works (even the one-off Spartacus) have a dark philosophical vision and satirical point to make. It's like trying to mix Socrates with Nietzsche or even Aristotle. They're all great, but very different. The decision to use Spielberg was too superficial (""who's recognized as the best film director right now, generally speaking?..."").It didn't work, not because of Spielberg's genius movie-making technical skills, it didn't work because of Spielberg's lack of the dark philosophical satirical vision. Spielberg is a genius at making a movie that wows an audience; Kubrick is a genius at making a movie, perhaps a satire, with a dark view of or exposition of ironic hypocrisy, in human beings and society.Just look at the expressions of George C. Scott in ""Dr. Strangelove"" in the war room. A manly sophisticated general, with oodles of power, making childlike pouts and expressions.

309,claudemercure,flawed masterpiece,8,8 November 2001,"A.I. is the movie where Steven Spielberg attempts to channel Stanley Kubrick and succeeds to a stunning degree. Neither filmmaker could have made this spooky, moving film alone. If, for instance, Robert Zemeckis had made this movie, it would have been a big bowl of corn syrup, but Spielberg didn't wimp out - not for the most part, anyway.The two main flaws: 1) The sequence where the machines get tortured could have been more imaginatively conceived. It felt a little too much like something we've all seen before. 2) The last act. Spielberg brings the story of his boy's quest to a beautiful fairytale peak; if the film had ended at the bottom of the ocean with that endless prayer, it would have been a masterpiece. But then there is a jump to the future that's so jarring it took me out of the movie. This is followed by a coda wherein he hands the hero his wish in a way that feels contrived.Still, it is heartening to see that someone so late and secure in his career is still taking chances. I have a lot of affection for this movie, because of everything it gets right. There are many moments of brilliance, none of which I want to ruin here.

310,johcafra,A Puzzle of the Heart,5,26 December 2006,"A.I. will enter the vaults as one surpassingly jumbled film. Capable acting, considering what the players are handed, superior production values, and seamless FX. That last part gnaws at me for current movies in general, as the FX in this one are well nigh perfect but by default become the movie itself when the story doesn't keep up.And, now, the story. Plain and simple, A.I. is the retelling in three distinct movements of a fairy tale that is itself based upon a wildly infeasible technological premise. For starters we've a very long way to go before we produce ""mechas"" of the order depicted. Doubtless to get that far ""orgas"" first had better learn how to survive among other orgas, not to mention deal with the Greenhouse Effect.Was it a sincere yet bungled attempt to emulate the style of an auteur? I'd expected an homage to Kubrick, and after some time and reflection I concluded that I had been proffered one. I didn't expect a Kubrick film, so not getting one didn't overly disappoint me, and it didn't take much time or reflection to so conclude.A.I. instead appears an attempt to meld not two but four and possibly SIX distinct styles: Kubrick's clinical irony limned by a perfectly wretched sense of humor; Spielberg's sympathetic humanism with a flair for cinematic showmanship; the quiet yet burning foresight of Brian Aldiss (part of the film's opening movement); and the similarly far-sighted yet decidedly noisy style of Ian Watson (a source, I suspect, of much of the film's central movement). In there, somewhere, is the reported work of yet a fifth contributor, British author Susan Maitland, and judging from the DVD extras we can't underestimate the key storyboard artist's contributions.Kubrick at least took other peoples' work and made it HIS. Perhaps if Spielberg had only tried to capture ONE style as sincerely as he had done with the uniquely visual style of author J.G. Ballard in Empire of the Sun, which also benefited from playwright Tom Stoppard. Steven, you're a craftsman and a consummate filmmaker, when you're good you're outstanding, but you're more translator than writer, and if you openly try to emulate a genius you invite only comparison.HERE BE SPOILERS: Should I have contented myself with viewing another's heartfelt attempt? Then why did the mechas' world-view sound better coming from Tezuka Osamu and Astro Boy? If you visit the Delaware River Valley, you'll quickly conclude that Trenton and Haddonfield, New Jersey, not to mention what must be an odd take on The City of Brotherly Love, would fare hardly better than an inundated ""Man Hattan."" And can any industrial designer explain how a former ""Mecha of the Year"" can look like a spider crab eating a TV set, lecture sociology like Gunny Hartman, and willingly wait in line To Serve Man as ordnance?To be fair to Kubrick I suspect he relinquished control over this project because he felt he wouldn't have been able to dramatically resolve Aldiss' core short story without having been judged derivative of his own seminal work while suffering the shrill observation that his film would've been better off in Spielberg's hands to begin with. I can readily imagine Kubrick's enticement by the concept and storyboards, but this supremely calculating auteur's apparent inability to tie all the threads together must have frustrated him to no end.To be fair to Spielberg I can empathize with his stated urge to film a story that had been a passion of a mentor and friend. He has grown as a director, and I can't conceive his having filmed anything even remotely like A.I. as a wunderkind, regardless of the movie-making technology he could then summon.To be fair to both these talents my anticipation of this creative mind-meld made the compulsory previews of upcoming summer blockbusters sheer physical torture. (Perhaps that was intended.)Each of us has strong feelings about A.I., and recall that's precisely what Kubrick wanted from each of us, at least openly, with 2001 and A Clockwork Orange. However, not once did Kubrick inspire me to direct any film of his better than he. Instead he made me focus on what he wanted to say, or make me think he wanted to say, even if it took me 30-plus years to get the message.HERE BE SPOILERS: So, for those among us who like to play auteur, and assuming that Kubrick truly did fight to have the film end nearly the way it did, consider dropping any reference from the final movement to: (a) The Blue Fairy (if you must have this tease, be subtle and credit the attentive viewer with an innate capacity for recollection); (b) the ""fly-in"" (focus on the whatever-they-were when they're there and not while they're on their way to getting there); and (c) all narration and dialogue save for what passes between mother and ""child"" (which, when it worked, spoke volumes with little more needed than a shared look).These changes certainly would've shortened the running time, but they also would've made a more complete homage to Kubrick by posing a larger puzzle to all of us. And each of us would've been willing to embrace the puzzle and try to solve it to our own heart's content, for despite his perceived coolness Kubrick had to passionately want orgas to think for themselves in spite of themselves while the mechas stuck to the program.(UPDATE: Much insight is pleasurably provided by the same-titled book edited by Jan Harlan and Jane M. Struthers. The ""conceptual artist"" Chris Baker played a key role. Yet another science fiction author (and one of my favorites), Bob Shaw, contributed. Apparently A LOT of thought was given to the production, not the least by Kubrick himself. However, my view of the finished film remains unchanged.)",A.I. Artificial Intelligence

The main problem seems to be is the muddled narrative.  It is all over the place.  Without getting too much into the particulars of the plot, the film starts off okay, but by the second act the film starts to drift aimlessly and never gets back on track.  In the last reel or so, the film rolls off a series of endings which mostly fail to generate the emotional impact that is Spielberg's trademark.  Some semblance of a theme survives, but its impact is weakened by the film's lack of urgency.  The theme is also not brought out in the most compelling way.

Jude Law is completely wasted in a role that is little more than a supporting part. He is poorly photographed & doesn't even get a costume change. He deserves better. The humans are not likeable esp. the mother who reminded me of the Houston mom who drowned her five children in a bathtub. The scene where she abandons her child in the forest is gross.

314,Lumpenprole,"messy, but I'm glad I saw it",6,28 October 2002,"spoilersIt's not really a popcorn flick.  It's worth noting that cuz a lot of the negative reviews seem to come from people disappointed by the film's slow pace and (often needless) expository chatter.  (Then again, with all the reviews referring to the aliens at the end, I can't help but conclude that Spielberg is right - people do need to have everything spelled out, hammered home and repeated.)First act - interesting.  Spielberg introduces a robot boy into a vaguely sympathetic family.  Camerawork and great acting on the part of Osment succeed in keeping the whole thing uncanny.  Lotsa interesting themes are set in motion, including a particularly brutal Kubrickian one that says that Gods owe nothing to their creations.Then David gets dumped in the woods and the movie lurches between audaciously good elements and some annoying self-indulgence.  Spielberg begins beating the Pinocchio theme like a gong and vast set pieces are introduced that don't add up to much.  The rather long trip to the red light district seems to contribute little to the story beyond redirecting the group to Manhattan.  Also, sometimes Spielberg uses sets and fx a little too much.  There were just too many shots of sadists revving dorky motorcycles at the Flesh Fair and the exquisite moon blimp got to seem ordinary after a while.  Losing and then reuniting with Teddy Bear and Gigolo Joe seemed to eat up time needlessly.  And there was far too much expository dialogue as well as a Capt. Obvious voiceover narrator.  ""Hi Jude Law!  Bye Jude Law!"" His very likeable character filled an interesting niche (nonthreatening male, surrogate family) but his on-the-run subplot went nowhere.Even with those complaints, I found the middle section of the film impossible to look away from.  The climax walking through Gepeto's workshop was nice.  The mech junk pile and moonrise was riveting.  I was unreservedly thrilled by every choice in art direction.  The direct way Spielberg handled the essentially Oedipal hangup of his hero was touching.Then there's the cornball brain-damaged ending.  All I can say is DANG, THAT SUCKED!  Except for conceding that the kid was only really interested in feeling wanted, the ending dropped or ignored almost every theme and sentiment established in the previous two hours.

There was not enough story to take the film past 2 hours.  As a result, the film really began to drag.The special affects were first rate.  Lucasfilm did an excellent job on them.  That was the only part of the film that kept me watching.  That I liked.  Over all, okay (5 out of 10).  This rating is also rare from me for a Sci-Fi film.  I love Sci-fi.  This one was not very good though.",A.I. Artificial Intelligence
317,MyDarkStar,Can Haley Joel Osment give 'bad' performance ?,6,20 November 2001,"The answer apparently is 'no', because Osment applies that innocent type of desperation to this role perfectly. There is a scene in this movie (I won't give away anything here) that takes place in a forest with his 'mother' that, I admit, made me cry. His performance here ranks up there with his ""The Sixth Sense"", and ""Pay It Forward"" performances. He is definitely something special.With that said, I have to say that this movie disapointed me as a whole. This is the best way to illustrate why : when you have a movie that has names like Stanley Kubrick, Stephen Spielberg, and Haley Joel Osment involved, and the one that seems to be holding up his end of the deal the best is the child actor something is wrong.Of course, it's hard to knock Kubrick, since he had passed on before this movie. So that leaves Spielberg. What is wrong with this movie ? The performances are great (Jude Law puts in a solid performance). The plot is interesting. I think the answer is in the direction that it starts to take towards the end (again not giving anything away here). It seems as though Spielberg is kind of caught in an uncomfortable position here. He seems to be trying to make a Spielberg-Kubrick movie - one that has that warm-central theme (E.T.) and one that has that has all the Kubrick-ish elements of surrealism (2001). I'm not claiming to be the first person to make such an observation, but it's true. It makes for an awkward ending - one that should be about twenty minutes shorter, or at least different.
Final word : I have heard many people put this movie down for many reasons. However, I think in the future, people will become a little more softer towards it and come to like the good aspects of it. Again, in this case that would be Haley Joel Osment. I gave it a 7 based on his performance, and the intriguing plot.",A.I. Artificial Intelligence
318,Matador07,"Good Idea, Poor Execution",5,7 May 2003,"I would say that I was disappointed by this movie, except that I admittedly went in with relatively low expectations (based on reviews) and it wasn't THAT bad.  But the movie WAS a mess.  There is a great idea buried in here somewhere, and its an interesting topic with great dramatic potential.  But the movie only achieves emotional fusion in fits and starts, and it just sort of wanders on along rather than moving with force and purpose.  The ending, in particular, should have been much, much better, and felt tacked on, perhaps in service of the fairy tale narration.  In the end, this one felt like it needed two or three more passes beneath an editor's red pen to tighten it up, focus the plot, highlight the theme, etc.  I was very ready for it to be over, long before the final credits rolled.There is a great movie about this topic out there waiting to be made, its just disappointing when arguably the greatest living director failed to deliver.

319,TIALI,so bad I want to punch myself in the face,3,1 July 2001,"there are so many reasons to hate this movie: the most important one is that fairy tale does not come true.  David never becomes a real boy, nor does his mother love him.  He alters his wish to fit the circumstances and convinces himself that it came true.  If you say the movie is a fairy tale, then it's a bad one.  If you say it's Science Fiction, it's even worse.  Robots programmed for love-making would never be programmed to fly a helicopter; robots that play music would probably be able to record music, also, so Law's character could record the real killer's confession to play to the police....a robot that can't eat food probably shouldn't go in the pool, either...the science doesn't work.  The story mixes elements of Willy Wonka (Congratulations, David, you passed the test!); Return to Oz (Wheelies, Tick-Tock); and Hansel and Gretel. Why robots think it important to appear human is odd: they rummage for face parts when their faces serve to practical purpose (other that to generate sympathy from humans--why would robots be programmed with a survival instinct?) Robots think what they are programmed to think--the story did not say anyone was creating Blade Runner type robots, only servant lever models. Screw it, the movie sucks.

It is a Spielberg film that Kubrick would be proud to see. Some may say it's over-sentimental, but the entire central premise, the idea that gives complete credibility to David, is his core programming that gives him a loving bond to his mother. For the entire length of time I sat in the theater, I was completely engrossed in the story of David. Those with the greatest sense of wonder and imagination are the ones that will come away from the film with pleasure. This is in my opinion the best film of the year up to this point, and the remaining films of the year probably won't change my opinion very much.

If, in the final analysis, it was a work of art and storytelling, or if it was total puppy poop, the result affects *me*, the audience member. So to all who are making comparisons and voicing expectations in their reviews, I say that you are better showing off how marketing has controlled (and may still *be* controlling) your perspectives.To the people comparing 21st Century Spielberg to 20th Century Spielberg, I say that you need to broaden your range of storytelling styles. You'll be a lot less disappointed and better able to nail what makes a film work or not work.A.I. poses --- no, *demands consideration of* a morality question. Is it ethical to create a robot who can love? In fact, when do we know when we've crossed the line ethically in our invention of machines to appease our desire for convenience and gratification? The movie is terrifying and surreal. Visually, it breaks ground in going past spectacular. The film, in a word, is a success.For those who somehow think Spielberg equals feel-good, light hearted fare, and that he should not tell such tales as this, or ""Saving Private Ryan"" or ""Schindler's List"", all I can say is that you are inadvertently pigeonholing a brilliant director. The kinder ending of A.I. annoyed quite a few people who thought the film should have ended twenty minutes earlier. I disagree. The ending gave the movie symmetry.See this film, but use your brain when watching. Otherwise, you can always rent ""The Musketeer"" or ""Freddy Got Fingered"".",A.I. Artificial Intelligence

Sadly, today's audiences are so cynical and falsely sophisticated that any film that dares explore this area is taking a huge risk. A.I. is brilliant and bold. Those who don't get it could probably stand to have their hearts thawed out in a volcano.But it's not a perfect film. The acting, visual effects, and story are amazing.

They say true love is eternal and in this case, it is. I won't go over the story because anyone reading this would have seen it already, instead, I'll just give my impressions of it as a celluloid story. Spielberg is a master storyteller and here he certainly pulled at my emotions. The loss of a child, the loss of a mother, all here and waiting to pierce through anyone watching it. The film covers many complex emotions, but it doesn't skim over them, it ensures you, the viewer, are forced to eventually accept that a robot is more human than the child he replaced. All he ever wanted was to be loved, unlike the real human child that was bought out of him coma. It was David that possessed the compassion and willingness to compromise, it was David that felt empathy for both human and robot alike. It therefore seemed just that in the end, robot's were the dominant 'life form' on the planet. I rate this film very highly and give it ***** of ***** stars.",A.I. Artificial Intelligence

Yes, it does make a serious effort at tugging at your heartstrings. Yes, it has certain typical Spielberg moments. And yes, the last half hour of the movie was unecessary and way too ""deliberate.""

Sadly, Kubrick died before he could have a crack at it. Spielberg takes over the project and tries to inject some of stanley's ideas but they are executed so poorly and looks like spielberg did it because he had to, not because he wanted to. For example rouge city looks like something that would come out of Kubricks mind(Clockwork Orange Bar) but speilberg tones it down with lights flashing everywhere so we are really distracted. Gigolo Joe was played down from what Kubrick originally intended him to be. Kubrick is a director who really doesn't care about the audience so he pushes limits. Spielberg on the other hand has built his legacy by entertaining the audience so he tries to cater to them and goes for the PG-13 rating. Haley Joel osment is just really annoying as the robot and the only memorable character in the whole film is teddy. The flesh fair had no point in the story and Dr know was just spielberg showing he had ran out of ideas. The last thirty minutes has to be the worst in recent years as spielberg tries to introduce his trademark aliens to save the film(Close encounters of the third kind). This doesn't work.

People either love it or hate it, yet most of the ones who hate it seem to do so because ""it made no sense"" or because it didn't meet their expectations or fit what they wanted it to be.  I've seen very little negative comment about either film that thoughtfully expresses an opposing viewpoint.  I have mixed feelings about both films, but I think there is genuine genius in both of them, a brilliance of concept and a technical mastery in the execution of that concept.  I really hate to be elitist about this, but I can't help but be dismissive of the naysayers whose comments extend no further than ""it was a waste of time"" or ""it sucked"" or ""it wasn't what I thought it was going to be"" or ""another Spielberg tearjerker.""  A:  This is infantile stuff without depth, and B:  what movie were you watching?  A.I. is a tearjerker in exactly the way 2001 is.  That is to say, it isn't.  I think there are structural problems and a level of obviousness in the final portion that are troubling, yet I am thankful for a film that creates such a level of discussion and consideration, and which does so by extremely creative means.

327,brendonm,Not for the literal-minded viewer,9,9 July 2001,"When I walked into the theater I expected a schmaltzy flick like E.T. Was I ever wrong.  This movie tells me Steven Spielberg is still willing to take chances.  If he wanted to, he could just keep cranking out the populist fare (JURASSIC PARK, INDIANA JONES etc.)  that most viewers associate with him.I saw A.I. three times this week.  It has been a long time since a movie has held me in its grip like this.  The first time I just hung on for the kaleidoscopic, futuristic Bros. Grimm fairy tale that the movie is on the surface.  I went back for a second time to try to piece together some of the things I didn't understand the first time; I also thought the ending was tacked on the first time -- a second viewing showed me that the ending was actually perfect -- David's journey would not be complete without it.  The third I appreciated the highly imaginative image composition (the New York scenes are a spectacular example of using FX in service of the story).That A.I. has been received in a lukewarm fashion by mainstream audiences (""too boring"", ""bleak and depressing -- what's the point?"", ""enough with the Pinnochio references!"" etc.) belies the fact that most people take movies too literally now.  Someone on alt.movies.kubrick posted that the story symbollically follows Dante's ""The Divine Comedy"" -- I wouldn't be surprised if Kubrick had this secondary level of meaning in mind when he was developing it.  Perhaps in 10 or 20 years time, people will see what a masterpiece this movie is.  A.I. reminded me of what I felt like at different times in my life when I was forced to face the big ugly world on my own. There's also an almost Oedipal undercurrent to David's need to be loved my his mother, which hints at a large part of many men's relationships with their own mothers -- or just the simple need to be accepted by them (A.I. will no doubt bring out the sadness in people with unhappy relationships with their own parents).

329,ShinKyo81,"No matter what people say about this movie, I'll consider ""AI"" as a masterpiece.",9,29 June 2002,"(POSSIBLE SPOILERS THROUGH ALL THE COMMENT) :P I was truly expecting ""Artificial Intelligence"". The teaser trailer was as strange as... teasing :P. Steven Spielberg and Stanley Kubrick together creating a new film was also very interesting. I heard Kubrick was going to direct the film by himself, but because of his death, Spielberg got the job. But the truth is that Kubrick called Spielberg to ask him if he wanted to be the director. You don't often receive a call from a brilliant director offering you a film... but you won't probably have the luck to call Spielberg in order to direct your movie! :-). Anyway, on with the comment!Before watching ""AI"", you must realize it's a Kubrick's movie conducted by Steven Spielberg. So it will be a mixture between ""The Shining"" and ""ET"", but in my opinion it's more a Spielberg's film than a Kubrick's.
The story is quite interesting: in the future, the ice caps have melted and the sea level has increased a lot, leaving the cities near the shore under the water. The human population has been reduced, so the natural resources. Strict birth controls have been established in order to survive against the hunger. That's why robots become so important in human society.
The robot technology has reached so unbelievable levels that scientists can create a synthetic humanoid, physically and mentally like a human, but with some problems expressing emotions. But then, a group of doctors start a project in order to create a child robot with the ability to love. And that's when David appears.I'm not going to tell all the movie until the end, but with these introduction, you should get a picture of what the film is about: ""AI"" tells the story of the love between a boy and his mother, so be prepared for a really emotional movie. And don't expect an action futuristic thrill or you'll get disappointed...The acting is incredible. You have Haley Joel Osment playing as David, the child-robot, who steals all the attention of the movie and leads the film with an incredible performance. Then, as David's counterpart, you have Gigolo Joe, performed by Jude Law, who also does an incredible performance of his character. The acting is remarkable along all the movie. The evolution of David through the story is really good: in the beginning he acts like a robot, but in the end it's almost human.The SFX are brilliant: all the robots, Rouge City... Special mention to the reality of Teddy, the robot toy which follows David through all the movie. ILM does it again with this film.Ok, the film seems brilliant. Then why the bad reviews? People would say a list of cons: ""the film is very slow, very long, and very strange..."" ""Osment overracts in some scenes..."" ""They should have cut out the last 30 minutes..."", ""What's the point of that aliens in the end of the film?!..."". I'm not going to argue if some people didn't like the film. They have their opinion. I admit this film is difficult to assimilate, not popcorn summer movie. But FYI, the supposed aliens are not: THEY ARE ROBOTS, for god sake! They are even like the symbol of the robot company...I was going to say ""If you like ET or The Shining, you'll like this one"", but it's not true: it's a totally unexpectable film, full of emotion, special effects, all conducted with the incredible Spielberg, but with Kubrick behind all. If you want to see a genuine Spielberg's creation, see ""Minority Report"".Anyway, a really worth look! (my opinion) :P 10/10",A.I. Artificial Intelligence
330,Dia Klain,Takes some thinking over.,8,10 October 2001,"This may have been a Spielberg, but it made me think more of a modern Kubrick. This movie brings up the interesting moral question of whether humans can ever truly come to terms with machines being smarter and more advanced then them. And whether those machines will ever be human. Can the two mix and live together, or will they always stay separate with boundaries wide as an ocean in-between. When I first saw this movie my immediate reaction was that, although it is done very well in terms of acting affects and plot, something was just not right. More precisely, it was hard to understand just what to set your response to. Is this a touching family drama, as it starts out and ends, or is it a futuristic science fiction? At first this sudden change in atmosphere in several parts of the movie made one feel discomfort. Then thought kicked in and I started to wander. Could it be, perhaps, that this in its very stile attempts to show the clash of the robotic and human societies? Is the discomforting feeling that so many (judging by the reviews) felt meant to be there to show how the world of the humans and robots is not to be the same? Another aspect that troubled me was how the in the movie the robots were shown as totally good and peaceful, while the humans, with their emotions and love and hate and conflicts of spirit, where shown as the wicked ones. The only robot that had his hard edge points was the main character, who, of course, was supposed to be the one programmed for emotion as well. This aspect, whether accidental or purposeful interested me because, if one thinks about it. One needs emotions to hate. With ought emotions one can't really do anything that is based upon them which includes ambition, love, hate, determination, jealousy, exc. The last aspect I would like to discuss is the ending of the movie which so many did not like. There is a conflict of opinion in my mind about it. On one hand it was unnecessary and I would have probably preferred the would be ending during which I am sure everyone was ready for the movie to end. On the other hand it is an interesting concept that the popularly proclaimed `aliens' would use this boy that always wanted to have a soul to learn about the soul. This movie is a never ending search. Even after it is over one can not help but search within themselves what their emotions to it are.",A.I. Artificial Intelligence
331,madcardinal,A Good Effort From Hollywood,8,28 April 2011,"A stirring, high-quality film with solid acting and an interesting story, what sets A.I. apart from the usual Hollywood fare is that it is not mere entertainment. This film explores human moral obligations regarding the things we create. If humankind creates a robot that can love and develop a will of its own, is it still just a machine? The viewer begins by watching a sci-fi flick set in a family home; but the film becomes extraordinary through two expansions of our frame of reference, suggesting that we weigh the human capacity for cruelty and consider our own existential significance in time-space. And it's entertaining! Good stuff, this one.",A.I. Artificial Intelligence
332,kylopod,A hard film to judge,6,9 November 2005,"Stanley Kubrick made a career out of directing brilliant but unpleasant movies. The ultimate example is ""A Clockwork Orange,"" which I saw for the first time just a few months ago. I found it astonishing, thought-provoking, and visually brilliant. But my experience watching the film was not in any way a pleasant one. The film chronicles the hideous crimes of a charmless psychopath, and ultimately how he is captured and subjected to an almost unimaginable series of tortures. I suppose some moviegoers might find those kinds of scenes entertaining, but I do not. Nevertheless, I consider it a great film, and a tremendously important one.""A.I."" is harder for me to justify. While not technically a Kubrick film, it is a Kubrick project that was finally directed by Steven Spielberg, following Kubrick's death. The result is a film that manages to combine the worst qualities of these two great filmmakers: it has Kubrick's obtuseness as well as Spielberg's sentimentality. The ending is deliberately designed to frustrate, to remove itself from any possible human reference point that we can easily relate to. At the same time, it's the sort of film that wants to be loved. There is even a teddy bear character that evokes mystery and awe more than cuteness. This awkward fusion of purposes left me feeling distinctly uncomfortable.I feel unjustified for giving the film as low a rating as 6/10. I just so intensely disliked the film that I have great difficulty rating it any higher, despite its clever and thoughtful handling of the concept of artificial intelligence. No doubt Kubrick has covered this territory before, in ""2001"" with the character of Hal. But he seems to expand on it in this film, which features two android characters, a child robot played by Haley Joel Osment, and a robot gigolo (don't ask) played by Jude Law. The behavior of these characters is so subtle and complex that I was often left wondering what they were thinking and feeling, what the experience of being a robot was like, if such an experience is possible. I personally believe that there is something special about human subjective experience that cannot be duplicated by computer technology. But this movie presents the opposite view very compellingly, and without taking the standard route of making the androids seem human.In this regard, Osment is spectacular: his performance in my opinion surpasses his Oscar-nominated one in ""The Sixth Sense."" There were moments when I looked at his eyes, his facial expressions, and I sensed an adult level of understanding and depth. Perhaps no child actor is better than Osment at acting creepy without being cute, as in one early scene when he startles his family with oddly forced laughter that doesn't seem to come with the appropriate emotions. He is playing a character who's supposed to pass for a child while not really being a child, and we slowly realize that he is in fact an alien intelligence with his own perspective and goals. Unlike a real child, he is not in the process of forming an identity. He already has one, and his only task is to fulfill his set desires and instincts, including his unbreakable attachment to his ""mother"" (Frances O'Connor) whom he is preprogrammed to love.This setup is not very conducive to melodrama, yet that's much of what we get throughout the film, which tries to cast itself as a modern reinterpretation of ""Pinocchio."" Since Osment's character is not a real boy, we can never relate to him as one. His emotions are as artificial as his intelligence, and no enchantment or anything else will turn him into a real boy, because he simply isn't one. Yet the movie tries to manipulate our emotions so that we do see him as more human than he actually is. This approach leads the film to lose its focus in the second half and put forth one of the more perplexing and unsatisfying endings I've seen in a long time. I don't mind whether a film ends happily or sadly, but it should not try to force a weak solution to a hopeless situation, just to gain a few moments of cheap sentiment.",A.I.

333,diztorted,Just when we needed a modern fairy tale...,8,21 September 2001,"As the film ends, we all wonder who we really are...Are we capable to love endlessly like David did? Isn't that to be even more human than we all are? The thing is, these times we are living lack of fairy tales that bring up the best we can be as persons and human beings, until now. The journey of David is a journey that will not be forgotten in a long time, even if it didn't raised as much as it was expected.But, Who's David, is he real, is he a mecha (mechanical person), is he a combination of both, and the most important question is...How can a fairy tale turn a meca into a real person?...As in all good fairy tales, or films, you have to see it to believe it. Although, this might not be the most original story ever told, since there are thousands of books and films dealing with the morals of living with robots, or how should a human person interact with artificial persons, this is a new focus on the subject. A modern Pinocchio that shows that no matter what age are you living in, the struggle for a different person against the whole world will always be the same one, the search for happiness and most of all, love. Love makes the impossible possible, and for the unbelievers, here's David to show us that. You will never believe this; you will even hate yourself for being a real person and not a mecha like David.There are many allegories and metaphors regarding how real are humans, and how unreal are robot, but if I would talk about everyone of those I would probably never end. Also, the film can't be denied of the genius of Stanley Kubrick and the imagination and power of Steven Spielberg, none of them could have done something like this without the other.
The result of all this work and concepts I have been writing about is, a stylish, witty, superb fantastic adventure that dives deep into the soul reaching powerful nerves. It is almost impossible not to be touched by it, as it is impossible not wanting to cry. So live it, and become real watching David and his journey throughout the heart.",A.I.

334,jmoney-2,We haven't had a serious science fiction film this good in quite a while.,9,27 June 2001,"This, at long last, is the world of Stanley Kubrick's A.I. For 15 years, the movie remained a seemingly mythical promise -- Kubrick's long awaited return to science fiction. For ages, the movie remained in pre-production as Kubrick waited for special effects technology to advance to the point where his vision could be achieved. Alas, just as that time arrived, Kubrick left this mortal coil. And so it is left to Steven Spielberg -- who collaborated with Kubrick during the movie's long development process -- to examine the concept that so fascinated his mentor. At its core, A.I. looks at what will happen when the human race acquires the ability to create a machine that will love. What will happen when love can be literally packaged, put in a box and sold? What responsibility will humans have for machines that love them?The machine, in this case, is David, a prototype robot boy played wonderfully by Haley Joel Osment (The Sixth Sense) made-up to make his skin look slightly rubbery. David is the perfect child. He goes to bed whenever you tell him. He smiles, he's helpful, polite, and he will never grow up. And he loves unconditionally.He is given to a set of parents in need, but like any toy, David quickly becomes expendable. Soon, he's cast out into the futuristic wilderness and must set out on a quest to regain his mother's love. Sadly misguided by the fairy tale Pinocchio, David believes the only way he can win his mother back is by finding someone who can turn him into a real little boy.
Here, the sensibilities of Kubrick and Spielberg both merge and diverge. Kubrick -- the cynic -- would have had fun with the absurdity of a machine that will stop at nothing trying to carry out its program, even if it means trying to achieve something that's unachievable. Spielberg, meanwhile -- the more sentimental artist -- approaches David's quest as being emblematic of one of the most basic and universal human desires... David just wants his Mommy! We all identify with that basic need and Spielberg taps into that to pull our heart strings.The styles of Kubrick and Spielberg are seen in different ways. The lighting and the shooting style is mostly Spielberg, with a few Kubrick homages. Kubrick was known for a cold style and probably would have foregone the many warm tones used here. Much of the art direction and music is reminiscent of 2001: A Space Odyssey and A Clockwork Orange (there's even a ""Milk Bar"" sign visible at one point). But the movie probably owes just as much to Blade Runner, particularly in David's journey through the harsh urban future world. One setting, Rouge City, looks like a sexed-up Las Vegas on crack.
It is in these harsh outer realms that David meets up with other mechas, namely a sex robot named Gigolo Joe, played by Jude Law. Spielberg plays the ""sex machine"" concept for laughs, but in a PG-13 way. One can only imagine where Kubrick would have gone with the idea. David also sees the harsh treatment most mechas receive from resentful orgas. In one extended sequence, David is swept-up into a ""flesh fair"" -- a bizarre spectacle in which robots are destroyed in violent ways for the amusement of humans.The visual effects involving the mangled robots are well done, but we've seen this CGI craftsmanship so often now, audiences will almost take it for granted. The most enjoyable visual effect turns out to be David's robotic ""supertoy"" sidekick, Teddy. Spielberg manages to make the character utterly adorable without causing you to gag. Think Snuggle the fabric softener bear with the voice of a truck driver.The worst sight is a cartoon character voiced by Robin Williams that feels completely out of place. By the way, also listen for voice cameos by Chris Rock, Ben Kingsley and Amy Irving.A.I.'s only other weakness is its pacing. The movie is only about two hours and 15 minutes, but it feels a lot longer. Many will also find the ending too drawn out. The film could easily end about a half-hour before it does; instead we're treated to a 2001-ish through-the-stargate style denouement. Some will lose patience with this part of the film, but its addition allows the introduction of another BIG SCIENCE FICTION IDEA -- one that I won't reveal here.In the end, A.I. is not everything fans have hoped for all these years, but it's darn close. And it's simply nice to see the film finally unspooling on a theater screen. We haven't had a serious science fiction film this good in quite a while. A.I. is a film that ponders deep ethical questions about technology and the future of the human race and challenges us to examine the true meaning of love.

335,klg19,Stop him before he films again!,1,5 July 2001,"If ""Eyes Wide Shut"" hadn't been such an iffy effort, I might surmise that Stanley Kubrick would be spinning in his grave with the release of Spielberg's take on his A.I. project.  Something tells me he still wouldn't be best pleased to see his idea subjected to the Spielberg Schmaltz Machine.Revealing himself as totally bankrupt in the imagination account, Spielberg recycles bits from his Greatest Hits collection: the first sight of David (the artificial boy) recalls the first sight of the alien in ""Close Encounters of the Third Kind,"" the moon motif evokes ""E.T.,"" the inexplicable teddy bear is a reborn Gremlin (with the voice of Hal the computer, from ""2001: A Space Odyssey"") and, most reprehensibly, the Flesh Fair smells of ""Schindler's List.""  The cocoon-like bed in the boy's room even has the Dreamworks logo to lull the kid to sleep!But this would be almost tolerable if the story itself weren't so dismally flawed: full of inconsistencies and unmotivated acts.  If humanity could create a robot (not to mention a child's toy) that can remain active for 2000 years, how could they not come up with a way to maximize or replace their resources so that the robots weren't necessary in the first place? If a mecha boy is destroyed by eating spinach (take THAT, Popeye), how does he remain untouched by being submerged in water?  If all of Manhattan (with its underground power cables) is under 50 storeys of water, how does William Hurt's character maintain a home and laboratory at the top of a skyscraper? What on earth caused the creeped-out mother first to activate the love-imprint and then agree to abandon the loving son?  Nothing in Monica Swinton's behavior as shown caused either act to make sense.  And let's not forget: who the heck is providing the voice-over?The question about Monica nods to the odd undertone of misogyny in the entire film.  Let's leave aside the startling entrance gates to Rouge City, where pneumatic babes with their heads flung back fellate each car as it approaches.  The notion of the artificial boy appears meant only for mothers.  When David's imprinting is activated, he calls Monica ""Mommy"" but Henry is still ""Henry.""  Apparently, only mothers who lose sons are in need of this artifical support.  The only compassionate female in the film is a mecha nanny at the Flesh Fair, who consists only of a body and a face: the camera makes it quite clear that there is no brain behind the features.  I found myself consumed with curiosity about the nature of Spielberg's relationship with his own mommy.One of the greatest flaws, however, is Spielberg's avoidance of the question he poses at the very beginning of the film.  One of the great scientist's assistants asks, ""Once you've made a robot love a person, how do you get that person to love the robot?  It's a moral question, isn't it?""  Indeed it is, but Spielberg isn't going to waste his time on  anything profound and moral.  Too busy with his modernized fairy-tale, he won't even address what the nature of love is.  Because what David evinces is not love, it is programmed obsession.  The film, already mistitled (nothing in the film has ANYTHING to do with artificial ""intelligence"" -- except perhaps the making of it), isn't even dealing with artificial emotion.But nothing -- NOTHING -- in the film prepares you for the barrage of saccharine implicit in the last 15-20 minutes.  Instead of ending this disaster where it made the best cinematic sense to, with David endlessly imploring the Blue Fairy to make him a real boy, Spielberg tacks on a nauseating and profoundly pointless coda in which David gets...well, what? What exactly did he gain?  The ending was so manipulative (Spielberg's calling-card) and syrupy as to make this viewer need a shower.Save your money.  Don't be Spielberg's enabler.",A.I.

Two of the most creative and talented film-makers in all of cinematic history (Spielberg and Kubrick) come together to make one of the most confounding films ever.The story concerns the creation of a robot child named David who is more human in terms of emotion then most others of his kind. After being abandoned by his surrogate parents in the woods, he resolves to find the elusive Blue Fairy who can make him into a real, live boy.OK, so the film also has some allusions to ""Pinnochio."" That might overwhelm things for some but this film is a feast for the eyes with some of the most astounding visuals ever put on celluloid. Also, in true Kubrick fashion, there are many thought-provoking questions and ideas. However....The films has it's flaws, not too many but pretty egregious nonetheless. Among them: the lead performance by Haley Joel Osment is both obnoxious and annoying, the end goal (the aforementioned Fairy) is absolutely ridiculous and the ending is a complete, Spielbergian joke.

338,DD-931,21ST CENTURY FAIRY TALE,8,19 July 2001,"One of Kubrick's lasting contributions to film is his refusal to simplify the perspective of his movies for the mass audience.  To people who approach A.I. expecting a straightforward speculative science fiction story, the film will not work.  It is only when audience members reject their own initial expectations of A.I. and seek to find a perspective that will enable them to fully experience the intentional impact of the film that they will get the full meaning of what they have seen on the screen.This is not an easy film to watch.  It explores deep, even primal emotions, particularly in the first and last segments.  Spielberg clearly knew that the audience would want to pull away from these emotions at crucial moments. Thus, the ""cheats"":  the elements of the film that ring false, but allow the audience a buffer zone between their feelings and the film.  The film had almost no chance to achieve complete success, but one could argue that without Spielberg, the film would have been virtually unwatchable.  And the emotions plumbed in A.I. are still quite powerful and evocative.And that is why A.I. is a 21st Century Fairy Tale.If this film must be called a failure, then I would rather Hollywood made a hundred failures like this than one ""Fast and the Furious"".",A.I.

That's because no matter how you feel about it, you will feel it passionately. Even if it's passionate ambiguity, Or ambiguous passion. ""AI"" elicits that kind of reaction. My guess is, you'll either find 75 percent of it cynical and 25 percent redeeming, or 75 percent gloomy but visionary and 25 percent saccharine crap.If someone asked me ""Is that movie any good?"" and ""Should I see it?"" my answers would be ""I don't know"" and ""Yes.""

At the time, I didn't get why, but now it makes complete sense. You need one time to get a handle on everything and another time to analyze it.Also, the influence of two disparate directors -- Kubrick and Spielberg -- is obvious here. To my mind, Kubrick managed to direct a majority of this film from the grave. But the last half hour is pure Spielberg, and isn't the end what counts?Kubrick, who -- and I'm going to p*ss people off with this -- was losing his touch at the end, manages to exert huge influence over the film. Every dark moment devoid of human goodness is his. And come on, try to even SUGGEST I'm wrong about that. On the other hand, the whole ending, which could have been dropped to make an entirely different movie, feels like Spielberg refusing to accept Stanley's ultimate conclusion.Spielberg, who has ventured into this childhood wish-fulfillment territory before, ultimately wins the philosophy battle, what with him being the alive one who actually directed the film.By the way, to put the issue to rest, the ""aliens"" in the third act are the Mecha.

342,donaldgilbert,A Spielberg Production,3,7 July 2001,"What led me to think this movie would be a different kind of Spielberg film? Perhaps it was marketing (like attaching Stanley Kubrick's name to it) or that I hoped the theme would justify an intelligent and thought-provoking treatment; or maybe because I thought he had another trick up his sleeve.However, he ruined it by relying on all his old stunts* to try pulling at our heartstrings while insulting our intelligence.  The movie is one lapse in logic after another.  Teddy is a good example.  If you've seen the movie, you'de know he was an extremely devoted and intelligent robot, and possessed seemingly human-like emotions.  If engineers could build a ""Teddy"", what was the challenge in building a ""David""?  I thought David was some revolutionary robot?!  Oh, I know- Teddy was there in the cute Disney-esqe sidekick role. And did Teddy really fit in this story anyway?  Only in the cliche-flooded world of Hollywood superstar director S.S.The movie was also very dull and confused, going (as others here have mentioned) in a variety of directions for almost three hours (I don't mind long movies if they are good).  I really am sorry that a script that Kubrick supposedly worked on for years was given such an apparent rush job by Steven Spielberg.  I just hope the Kubrick version of the script finds it's way to publication.  I gave the film 3/10 for some of the visual effects.*the sentimental good characters and the shallow evil-characters for stereotyping the audience into exaggerated identification; huge, awesome visual and audio effects to overwhelm our senses, including the obligatory sweeping John Williams scores; cutesy characters to charm us and to relieve tension, etc.",A.I.

346,sloopydrew,Will satisfy the most discriminating of tastes,9,29 June 2001,"Ever seen one of those Conan O'Brien skits, the ones where he takes two celebrity couples, and through the magic of computer, shows them what their child would look like, if they chose to breed?  Since first hearing that Steven Spielberg was taking over Stanley Kubrick's film, A. I., after Kubrick kicked the celluloid bucket, I thought the film would be about as cute as one of those digitalized mongoloid freak infants Conan shows weekly on his show.  To my surprise, Spielberg took Kubrick's vision, twisted in some of his own ideas, and created an amalgam of a movie that will hopefully satisfy the most discriminating of tastes.This isn't just one film that you're seeing.  This isn't just one director, or one directorial style being displayed in front of your starving eyes. Although Spielberg gets most of the credit (Kubrick is relegated to ""concept""), this is obviously more Stanley's film than it is Steven's. Sure, after the first 30 minutes, or so, it moves at a near breakneck pace that Stanley wouldn't hear of, during his lifetime, but Steven begins to slow things down again at the end, just enough to remind you that this isn't really his baby, after-all.  This is merely a transfer from Kubrick's many discussions and concept designs regarding the film, before his death, to an actual movie that Spielberg created.  There are the trademark Spielberg moments scattered throughout; but instead of wrecking the film that Kubrick would have made, they actually accentuate what was obviously Kubrick's idea of where the film should have gone.Steven Spielberg does a wonderful job contrasting the darker vision Kubrick had of A. I. with his own lighter, fairy-tale version of how he feels the film should play.  After a few mushy E. T. type moments, the viewer is literally jolted into a world that could be created by no one other than the wonderful Stanley Kubrick.  This isn't A Clockwork Orange, but it damn well isn't Hook, either.  A lot of the parents in the theater found the film, and I quote, ""disturbing"" and, ""not for kids at all.""  I don't agree with those comments, but I do think that children should definitely be forewarned that this isn't the sweet little fable they've been promised in the television commercials.  Sure, David the machine (played by Haley Joel Osment) wants to become a real boy, to gain the love of his ""mother,"" which is all heartwarming, but he has a hell of a lot of very frightening (especially for the under 13 gang) set of obstacles to go through, if he ever hopes to attain his dreams.  This is a hard PG-13, and that's just the way Kubrick would have wanted it.Everything ""Kubrick"" in the film is spectacular.  The way David is befriended by the flamboyant Gigolo Joe (Jude Law, in his best role to date), a machine made for no reason other than to make love to lonely ladies in Rouge City, a neon-crazed part of the country that would put any red light district to shame, just had to have come from Kubrick's zany brain. A few of the ""Spielberg"" moments in the film are slightly shaky, but luckily there aren't that many.  The Spielberg scene that annoyed me the most was with ""Dr. Know.""  The entire section seemed robbed from Spielberg's original Jurassic Park, when Mr. DNA introduces Dr. Hammond, and then Hammond talks to the film version of himself during a presentation played to his visitors in hopes of explaining how his team was able to extract dinosaur DNA from mosquitoes.Still, I'm making double D cups out of single A's.  Spielberg and Kubrick essentially did a tag-team job of directing A. I..  Two directors of that caliber getting together to make a film just doesn't happen.  And it didn't. It took the death of Kubrick to make it happen.  Sure, if Kubrick had made it, with no help from Spielberg, it would be far more intense, a lot more boring (in a good way), and the cutesy stuff would have been cut.  At the same time, if Spielberg would have made it, with no help from Kubrick, it would be far more sentimental, and all the ""scary"" stuff would be replaced with glowing alien fingers and magical moments created to put a lump in the audience's throat.   Spielberg wrote and directed it with a little bit of both.  I think that, in the end, he was extremely daring with the pacing and attitude of the film, and had the nerve to bring Kubrick's vision to light.
I honestly believe Stanley would have been proud of the picture Steven created, warts and all.  I hope the majority of the movie watching community feels the same way.  In traditional Kubrick style, this film does get slow moving (think the last 15 minutes of Kubrick's 2001) in parts, and I'm afraid Attention Deficit Disordered America will turn their backs on A. I., looking for another hyper-spastic pile of crap like Tomb Raider.  Spielberg doesn't usually move this slow, or probe this deep, and a lot of his diehard fans, many of whom have probably never heard of Stanley Kubrick, may leave the theater sorely disappointed.I hope that Spielberg's fans are more open than I'm giving them credit for, and they help make the film a huge success, so we can see more films, in the ""event"" arena, that slow down long enough for plot and character development.  I honestly didn't think we'd ever get to see another big budget movie like A. I. again, and I don't want this to be the last of its kind.  I've seen one too many great movies become financial disasters, over the last decade.  And yes, A. I. is a great movie.  Kubrick and Spielberg produced the perfect baby; not even Conan, and his wonder-computer, could have seen that one coming.",A.I. Artificial Intelligence
347,TexMetal4JC,"Excellent, but a bit overdone.",8,30 June 2001,"Idea formulated by Stanley Kubrick (The Shining, A Clockwork Orange). Directed by Steven Spielberg (E.T., Jurassic Park). Music by John Williams (Star Wars, Indiana Jones). Starring Haley Joel Osment (The Sixth Sense, Pay it Forward). 	With names such as these, the hype was on for A.I., one of summer's most anticipated movies. Featuring trailers that told next to nothing about the movie and TV commercials that told little more, Spielberg and company still had few worries that A.I. would be one of the biggest movies of Summer 2001.
	But not everything Spielberg touches is golden (Jurassic Park II, 1941), and Kubrick's last posthumous effort was far from his best (Eyes Wide Shut). So although big opening week sales were guaranteed, it remained to be seen: How good is A.I. anyway?	The critics have been unsure, with some raving about it being some of Spielberg's best work. Some say it is overblown, pompous and a shining example of unfulfilled promise.	Both groups are right.	A.I. is a movie about finding your dreams, first of all. Haley Joel Osment plays the first-ever robot that has been programmed with the ability to love. Named David, he comes into the life of a couple whose only child is comatose. 	But David struggles to grasp the nuances of human activity and is abandoned when he nearly kills the recovering son by accident. 	Spurred by the story of Pinocchio, David searches for the mythical Blue Fairy, so he can be made into a real boy and be loved by the woman he calls `Mommy.' 	In his journey, he meets a robot designed for the gratification of women named Gigolo Joe  played by Jude Law  and witnesses first-hand the human prejudice toward robots in a `Flesh Fair,' a carnival designed for the torture and destruction of abandoned `Mecha.'	After an encounter with Dr. Know  voiced by Robin Williams  David and Gigolo Joe decide that Manhattan is the place where the Blue Fairy resides.	But will David find his Blue Fairy and thus receive the love he has always wanted? Or will he realize his dreams are mythical, his perceptions of reality nothing but an illusion? 	This is most likely one of the deepest, most heady movies made in the last five years, especially when taking into account the special effects factor that will surely draw the crowds. And its dual commentary on artificial intelligence as well as the unique human ability to reach for the stars is certainly refreshing.	On a technical aspect, A.I. is phenomenal. Spielberg's directing is top-notch, turning the movie from a sterile quietness in the beginning to a warm solitude at the end. His effects are reminiscent of past work, especially with the use of aliens  or perhaps they are ultra-advanced robots  at the end, and the scenes of a drowned and abandoned New York City are both beautiful and unsettling.	The score is simply incredible. Williams, known for his rousing action soundtracks, shows quite clearly that he is one of the best composers of our time with a soothing, entrancing score. 	And finally, the acting is superb. Osment is indeed the modern male version of Shirley Temple  the adorable child actor with copious amounts of talent. Law's modern-day, sci-fi version of the Tin Man is both comedic and lovable. Frances O'Connor's portrayal of David's `mother' is close to heart-wrenching.	Technically, A.I. is very close to perfect, on a level with Citizen Kane, The Shawshank Redemption and other cinematic classics.	But the story itself runs into problems that other Kubrick movies have experienced. Namely, it is too overblown.	So full of great ideals and allegory, it is easy to forget that A.I. is a science fiction movie  it is indeed one of the most realistic sci-fi movies ever. But it is a sci-fi movie that dreams to reach higher it seems, and in the process A.I. loses some of its mastery of the audience.
	In his efforts to make the audience cry, Spielberg only makes isolated scenes poignant, instead of a whole block of time, like in a true melancholic drama. 	In its efforts to wrap everything into a neat little package, Spielberg's movie runs 20 minutes too long, ending with an unnecessary epilogue that contains far too much explanation and redundancy. 	And in what seems to be a problem with several of Kubrick's movies, the point is far too overstated. To understand an implied meaning is great. To be told what the meaning is fine. But to be told the meaning and how you should derive it over and over as the movie goes on is certainly overkill, which unfortunately is what happens in A.I. 	Overall, A.I. is a shining example of technical prowess, a sci-fi movie that becomes much more and deserves every accolade it receives. It dares to create a plot and develop character with special effects in an era where effects are the plot and characters are just additional props.	Unfortunately, it seems that A.I. just tries too hard to be the artistic centerpiece, and it is here where A.I. will lose the following it tries so hard to achieve.8/10",A.I. Artificial Intelligence

I saw this movie in theatres when I was about 11, and remember coming out of the theatre more than disappointed. A few years ago I saw the movie again in a film class, and found it just as horrible.A.I. explores the topic every movie about a robot explores—what if they had feelings? A topic, I might add, that I never understood because the point of making a robot is it can do lots of hard work without getting physically or emotionally hurt. Anyway, I digress. A.I. takes place at some unnamed year in the future, and a robot manufacturer is talking about a new proto-type, a child robot that can feel love for its ""parents"". They decide to try out this proto-type ""David"" on an employee and his wife whose young son has died and is cryogenically frozen. David is played by Haley Joel Osment. It must be said that the only reason this movie is ever tolerable is Osment's performance. He manages to portray a robotic yet loving child, something that can't be easy to do. However, even a brilliant actor cannot save a horrible script.After a short adjustment period David develops a ""cute"", loving, bordering on creepy relationship with ""Mommy"". Things are going great until couple's ""organic"" son Martin is defrosted and brought home. Despite the fact her real child is alive again, Mommy can't bear to part with David. However, Martin is a cruel little SOB who makes it his mission to get rid of David. At Martin's birthday party he and his friends are preoccupied with stabbing David and checking if he is anatomically correct, so David clings to Martin for protection. They both fall into the swimming pool and David is accused ofattempted murder (?). The father then says that he must go. Mommy cannot deal with her ""mecha"" child being disassembled, so she does the most humane thing she can think of—abandoning him in the woods with the knowledge that the only person who loves him is gone forever! With only a vamped up Teddy Rupskin for company, David gets picked up by a robot-hating redneck group. He is put in a sort of monster truck rally where the goal is to destroy robots in the most creative ways possible. While there David meets Gigolo Joe played by Jude law, who is no more than a walking, talking sex toy. Because of David's unique programming he begs for his life, making everyone believe he is a real child. They release him and Gigolo Joe together, and David's new mission is to find the blue fairy from Pinocchio in hopes she will turn him into a real boy and Mommy will want him again. Joe then tells David they must go on a lengthy trip to a computer ""professor"". After a lengthy trip to the online professor (which David has to pay for), it tells him the location of the blue fairy. It gives him the location of a blue fairy statue in NYC, which is now under water. Joe and David take the trip to a very damp NY. While in NY there are a few scenes that feel like they are supposed to be meaningful and insightful into the mind, but are just wildly confusing. They are so confusing I can't even explain them properly. Anyway, David and his talking teddy go down in a submarine and sit in front of the statue for TWO THOUSAND YEARS! Then, aliens come! Through more confusing plot points they recreate David's ""Mommy"" in some strange attempt to understand humans, which have since gone extinct. It is then to be believed that David turned into a real boy and died happily with Mommy. This movie makes no sense, has so many plot holes it's ridiculous, gets indescribably confusing at the end, and is PAINFULLY long and boring. First of all, the fact that a child robot created for sad, childless adults being an 11-12 year old boy is ridiculous. If this ever happened, David would be much younger. In fact, in the short story this movie is based on David is three years old, but much more mature. Oddly enough, in the movie David is on the cusp of puberty but behaves like a pre-schooler, giving him the air of someone mentally challenged. There is NO point in the role of Gigolo Joe. He brings next to nothing to the plot, aside from a few bad sex jokes. And for some reason, NO ONE in this movie tells David that the blue fairy is MAKE BELIEVE. Despite the fact he has a computer chip for a brain, Joe is does not tell him this or any other useful information. The concept of the trip to this computer professor wastes so much time and makes very little sense. If this movie were made in the 70's, 80's or even early 90's it might. BUT, this movie was made in 2001. There were already several search engines like Yahoo! up and running. Surely they could predict this futuristic society would have something much more advanced, free, and accessible at any location. As for the alienswhoever wrote this script must have given up or handed it off to someone else at the last minute. It is absolutely Godawful. There is nothing good or entertaining about this movie, and the only slightly redeeming quality is that it stars Haley Joel in his prime.",A.I. Artificial Intelligence
352,brandon_veracka,"Although the production value is wonderful, it's simply not a good film..",5,30 July 2015,"I just watched this film as it's been playing on HBO lately (7/30/2015) and I had some time to kill. As a big fan of science fiction and films in general, I didn't hate it, but I didn't like it that much either.It must be mentioned that ""A.I. Artificial Intelligence"" is well-made and has that very professional level of polish that you expect from big-budget Hollywood films. It also has some great supporting cast to the lead role of Haley Joel Osment as David, a ""mech."" who is essentially a humanoid robot / android. Haley's performance is overall just sufficient; at times he does a great job of channeling one of my favorite robot impersonators, Brent Spiner, who plays Data on Star Trek: T.N.G. However at other points in the film, Haley's performance seems forced and immature, especially considering his truly amazing role as Cole in 1999's ""The Sixth Sense"". The other characters ultimately do not get fleshed-out in story well enough (aside from Gigolo Joe), and it leaves you feeling a bit lost.On the subject of Jude Law's role as Gigolo Joe, he is what saves this film from being an utterly boring family film. A film doesn't need to involve sexual aspects to be good, but the Gigolo Joe character in ""A.I."" is what really brings the movie together. Jude Law seems to have a talent for making even a lousy film decent enough to sit through.Another problem with ""A.I."" is there are just too many scenes which could've been shortened or scrapped completely. Also, many scenes are there purely for aesthetic value, because at the time, this movie's CGI was cutting-edge. The wasted time with bad scenes could've been better utilized to make the other character's story arcs better and more complete.Overall this film just didn't do it for me. The story was too full of filler and scenes of Haley Joel Osment doing ""cute"" & silly things (like smiling and daydreaming in awe of his surroundings), and it's unimportant to the film's story. Overall most of the film is good enough for the majority of folks who watch these kind of movies, but I would've liked to have seen a little more effort and adventure on the part of the actors, directors, and writers. My hat goes off once again to Jude Law though for always doing a great job in every movie I can recall seeing him in. I wouldn't recommend ""A.I."" unless you're feeling very adventurous.",A.I.

353,Lursa,A.I. Awfully Idiotic,1,5 July 2001,I had such high expectations for this film since I adore the early work of Kubrick and Spielberg. Disappointment set in about 20 minutes into the film. I stayed until the very end hoping there was something. SOMETHING there to redeem it. Haley Joel Osment is a wonderfully gifted actor. Jude Law is great. Please join me in hoping that they find a film worthy of their talent. This mess of a movie is not it.,A.I. Artificial Intelligence
354,timelord-3,"Spielberg fans will be bewildered, Kubrick's interested",7,13 September 2001,"SPOILERSAI has been much anticipated by movie goers to see what Spielberg would do with Kubrick's 'last' film - would it be a fitting tribute to the acknowledged master or would it be a cheap imitation?It was always going to be difficult to satisfy Kubrick fans who probably regard Spielberg as being close to the anti-christ but the movie itself has turned out to be an appropriate closure to Kubrick's career.AI is a film made up of three distinct parts (with a few themes running across various sections.Osment plays a boy robot, David who is given to the father of a family who works for the creators of the simalcrun, Cybertronics, who for over 100 years have provided robots for use as servants and companions.What makes David different is that he has been programmed with the ability to truly love, rather than just imitate the sensation.The first act is David being integrated into the new family and looking for acceptance - despite descending into sappiness on a few occasions it is well done.  The Kubrick/Spielberg influences are evident throughout - the almost in some respects clinical set design combined with a level of subdued and well placed lighting that adds a much needed dimension to the visuals.The second act enters the Pinocchio theme - David searches for the mystical 'Blue Fairy' - the only being that can make David into a true boy and therefore be truly loved by his new mother.He is accompanied by another Cybertronics construct, Joe Gigilo, who as the name suggests, is a pleasure unit with a sassy step and quick wit.  Jude Law is very good in the role, but you must wonder why the character was included at all other than to guide David to the next plot point.The third act (which I won't give too much away about) is simultaneously confusing, surreal and mesmerising.  The annoying voice over pointing out the bleeding obvious every 20 seconds is an unfortunate inclusion.It is also very unfortunate that the film limps to such a boring conclusion after the previous 2 hours of compelling viewing.  If the sacchrine wasn't turned up in the opening act it is allowed to flow freely in the final one.John Williams again provides the score to a Spielberg movie - and it was a surprise to see his name on the credits list.  His score is subdued, quietly melodic and very apt.On the acting front, Osment is quite good as the artificial boy David - his performance is a bit uneven in places but at all times you are convinced that he is just a little boy looking for the love of a parent.  Frances O'Connor is good as the mother hesitant about showing affection for this creation but slowly coming to love him.  Sam Robards is barely seen as the company Dad who is initially enthusiastic about David but suddenly and bewilderingly turns against him.The film is slow, but not disappointingly so, it isn't a film a regular Spielberg buff is going to get a lot out of.  Kubrick fans might wince at the over-sentementality of it all but should hopefully be sated by the incredible special effects, which are seamless and flawless.A film that could have done with a bit more trimming and some tightening up of its ending 20 minutes.7 out of 10.",A.I. Artificial Intelligence
355,mjensen-3,A Spielberg/Kubrick classic,8,15 December 2001,"The thing that I find spectacular about this movie is the directing, and the acting between Haley and Law. The reason why this movie is a combination  of Spielberg and Kubrick is it's humor and it's message about the dark and stupid side of the human race. I'll tell you some parts about the movie that make me feel this way. Remember that scene with Jude Law when he's dancing around and the scene when he tells this woman ""Once you have a Meca inside of you, you will never want a real man again"". Or the scene when his mom is about to die and Haley starts to cry. Steven is showing us that Haley has become human again after 2,000 years because Mecas can't cry. And if Haley's become human that means he's the one human left alive because the Human race was destroyed. Spielberg loves the Human race unlike Kubrick. This particular scene is a Spielberg idea.Now here's the Darkside of the movie. Remember little evil Martin and the evil dad who wanted to get rid of Haley, or when Law told Haley that the world changed and made everything worse starting with Manhattan, or when Mecas where being hunted and destroyed by Humans, and the aliens roamed a frozen Earth; all this was Kubrick's brilliant idea for the Human race.
I don't want to offend, but anyone who thinks or says that those aliens in the movie were evolved Mecas are just plain ignorant. Spielberg tells you what they are (aliens) right there in a scene when one of the aliens actually tells Haley where, why, and what's, their purpose for coming to Earth. This is one of the best classical movies ever made in the 21st century and in the last 50 years. And it's not as sad an ending as you might think. I know people may not get it, but what's not to get. The message is right there in front of you. Spielberg and Kubrick are telling us to slow down on our evolvement because if we create a being using Artificial Intelligence then maybe it will think bad thoughts and may become like a dictator and start a revolution against us, or maybe the Human race will become enraged and start a Meca Holocaust like in the Movie. Who knows what will happen.I hope whoever reads this comment will see the movie and remember to bring you're tissues and anti-depressants. I give it a 15 out of 10.",A.I. Artificial Intelligence
356,jaesboxer,"Kubrick's dreamchild, realized poorly by Spielberg",6,6 January 2003,"To start off, let me say that this movie was doomed from the start.  Master directors Stanley Kubrick and Steven Spielberg were apparently good friends, so when the former died, the latter took it upon himself to create what was to be Kubrick's next film, a complicated story about a machine child who is programmed to love.  I understand Spielberg's tribute, and it's a noble gesture, but the impending failure should have been obvious from the start. No two directors I can think of have such completely contrasting styles as Spielberg and Kubrick.  Kubrick is the icy intellectual, while Spielberg is the great entertainer.  Kubrick's films are ponderous and philosophical, Spielberg's delightfully exuberant and, in some cases (Schindler's List, The Color Purple) amazingly dramatic.  Both are true titans, but this film is a reality suspended in the void between intent and realization.  I am certain, had Kubrick done it, this would have quite closely resembled his 1968 masterpiece, 2001.  As it is, it bears a closer resemblance to Spielberg's E.T., yet carries with it none of the joy and emotion that film managed to bring.  INstead, A.I. is weighted down by the two director's visions. Spielberg, having written the film himself, did his best to honour Kubrick, yet all too often, A.I. lapses into Spielberg's sentiment, which Kubrick could not have tolerated.  The movie is redeemed somewhat by astounding visuals, and an intriguing premise.  It carries with it certain undeniable emotions including pity, sorrow, and even guilt.  Yet, at the same time, these emotions seem almost suspended as a concept.  Up until the ending, which is entirely proposterous and purely Spielberg, this manages to maintain a fair amount of dignity, as if Spielberg were saying 'it won't be great, but i'll do it right.'  All in all, A.I. is worth seeing, but if you're a fan of Kubrick or Spielberg, this film will dissapoint, for it falls into a vast gap of indifference that seperates the two great, if diametrically opposed, directors.6/10",A.I.

357,thechosen1,Not too bad ***POSSIBLE SPOILERS***,8,11 December 2002,"***POSSIBLE SPOILERS INCLUDED***OK, this movie wasn't too bad, but it wasn't too great either.  The direction was excellent, the special effects were excellent, BUT the story was going absolutely nowhere.  It started off really well, with Haley Joel Osment (great, great, great job) as David, coming and getting acquainted with his new family.  He gets attached to them almost immediately, especially his 'mother', very nicely portrayed by Frances O'Connor.  Then he meets the extremely charming and irresistable (well, to me anyway), Gigolo Joe, played brilliantly by Jude Law (the guy has A LOT of charm, I'm telling you).  After a few scenes the story starts to go down - fast.  I have absolutely no idea why it was written the way it was.  It went from a not-so-much-but-still-pretty-believable plot to a completely this-is-just-so-weird-and-impossible plot.  Yeah, I know this is sci-fi, but still, this story took the weirdest turn I have ever seen.  The whole idea of the major cities submerged under the water thing was ok...but the end... what's with the aliens?  I seem to think they were aliens anyway... reading poeple's memories and recreating people from their pasts by some sample of DNA that they might have left behind.  It just had nothing at all to do with David's development.  He was in exactly the same ""emotional"" state as he was when he was separated from his family... the hope to become real and to be with his mother again.  All the emotional development was already done. That was the whole point of the movie wasn't it?  Everything else after that just seemed to go way off track.  The whole ""blue fairy"" business was cute, but strange.  There must have been a million other ways to get David back to his mother.  Well, as for the overall special effects and direction, they were superb. The make up was good and the futuristic atmosphere created in some of the scenes was impressive.  Haley Joel Osment does an excellent job, as always.  He's a very pleasant actor to watch with extreme talent.  His expressions are magnificent.  Jude Law did very well, looked great (let's be honest here) and made Joe look very sophisticated in a strange sort of way (loved the little dance moves). Besides these two, Frances O'Connor was great, her expressions looked very real.Overall, this movie wasn't all that great, but not too bad, either.

358,dmc102,"Long, boring and dull Spielberg misfire.",3,22 November 2005,"AI is not a good film. That much is obvious to anyone hoping to enjoy a couple of hours entertainment. The film is a good 90 minutes too long, the characters are undeveloped and dull, the special effects are unconvincing, the script is without any kind of flair, the cinematography and editing are boring, the plot is uninspired and at times descends into stupidity and some of the film's actors are totally wasted. Shall we begin? From the off, AI is dull. The opening 30 minutes are probably the film's best, but that is not saying very much. The main actor, Haley Joel Osment is fine as ""David"", though he is not given a whole lot to do. The story of a family having lost its child and finding comfort in an artificial replacement is bearable, although there are moments in the first half of the film which suggest that it was originally intended to be a more sinister movie.The biggest disappointment of the film is Jude Law. His character is completely irritating and adds little to the story. The use of some language in the film such as ""Mecca"" and ""Orga"" quickly gets annoying as the actors do not know how to deliver them.Perhaps Stanley Kubrick would have made a better job of this.

I do like the futuristic landscape and logic of this world, it's great in scale and reminds me of Blade Runner. Haley Joel Osmond gives a unique performance, something not quite human, but something that has desires and feelings of it's own. Jude Law is also good, but his abrupt switch in character is a bit hard to believe. But of course, I have bring the ending up somewhere, there's so many camera shots I thought would be the last but the camera feels the need to keep rolling, and sure some stuff happens after that, but it's painful. I'm not going to say what happens, but I like some of the aspects of the ending, but they should be in a different movie.

It's quite clear the collective unconscious of the species foresees control, cataclysm and hatred, but this film was positively heartbreaking at points, and sheer nightmare elsewhere. Only towards the end of the film does it start to look a bit like Stephen Spielberg had anything to do with it.

Spielberg is too much of a director in his own right to make A.I. the way Kubrick envisioned it.  That being said I thought this film was fantastic.  Osment and Law were wonderful in their roles, Law in particular showing a lot of believability to his robotic performance.  The premise is nothing new, but the state of the world in the future is terrifying.  A world where many cities are now drowned and robots are built to perform tasks only to be discarded later. 
That is what is so heart-breaking about this movie.  A robot programmed to love a woman as a mother is then rejected by her.  He then spends the rest of his life wanting to be a real boy so she will love him.  The final thirty minutes of this film had me in tears.  It was a dark, depressing film at times, but ultimately, it was a happy ending.Well done to the human touches given to the robots.

364,Kevin_Maness,A.I. was REALLY awful.,3,13 July 2001,"I decided to keep my expectations low when I went to see A.I. last night. After all, the previews looked a little sappy (I mean the first previews with Osment looking cute and sad and laughing and talking about love--the second set of focus-group-revised previews had more explosions and stuff) and the whole ""where's the line between machine and human?"" thing has been done before.  Modern movies from the classic Bladerunner to the trite Millenium Man have more or less exhausted the theme, and even Disney's Pinnochio handled it fairly admirably a long time ago.  So what could Spielberg add?  As it turns out, his contribution to the Philip K. Dick genre is the worst movie I've seen in years in any genre, a mind-numbingly terrible movie that tries so hard to be serious and deep but fails utterly to engage in any kind of coherent discussion and, in the end, which even fails to entertain.Actually, my low expectations helped for the first 10-15 minutes of the movie.  I didn't mind that part.  But then when the little A.I. boy, David, is introduced to his human ""mother"" I had to start taking Stupid Pills.  (In case you don't know, a Stupid Pill is an imaginary drug that allows one to suspend disbelieve when a movie requires that you swallow blatant ridiculous contrivances in order for the movie to make sense.)  After taking a few more Stupid Pills to get past bad acting (not Osment--he's good in the movie, I thought) and other plot problems, I actually enjoyed the next hour and a half or so (I don't even know how long the movie was--seemed like it was in real time, and it covered two thousand years of the future).  I remember thinking at one point that I was getting my $8.00 of entertainment value out of this movie.  But then everything changed.The last half hour of this movie is so horrendous that it has wiped out all find memories I may have had of the first part of the movie.  And no number of Stupid Pills helped.  I won't give away actual plot details from the end. Suffice it to say that for 30 minutes or more, I kept hoping the movie would end, not just because it was getting embarrassing and then actually painful to watch Spielberg grasping for some bit of credibility, significance, or some hint of authentic emotion, but because the movie could have ended in several different places and been a much better movie (my favorite choice would have been when the ferris wheel crashes, know the part I'm talking about?  just end the movie there, and it's kind of cool).  Every decent ending that Spielberg passes up to add more tripe just made me wince and cover my eyes.  Theat didn't even help, though, because among the myriad weaknesses of the ending is a British voice-over that describes the ongoing travesty of David's life as if he were in a fairy tale.  For the last 15 minutes, the people in the theater were actually laughing out loud at the movie, and there really weren't any jokes in it.  At the end of the movie, in a touching and sort of sad moment, EVERYONE busted out in a collective guffaw and left the theater giggling and chuckling and mocking their least favorite moments in the movie.There were many things that came clear to me at the end of A.I.  One is that Spielberg had no idea what he was trying to say/ask/accomplish in making this movie.  I know that all films don't have to have a ""message"" so to speak, but this movie had many opportunities to be coherent, and then it dashed each one.  Another thing that was clear is that SPielberg has become so powerful that no one can stop him from making a really big mess out of a movie that could have been good--didn't any focus groups laugh inappropriately at moments in the trial runs of the movie? wasn't there any executive at Dreamworks who could say, ""Um, Steven, this really sucks""? Couldn't his wife do something?   Don't go see A.I.  If I could get some of my $8.00 back from Dreamworks, I'd do it.  If you ask me, this movie should have gone straight to Mystery Science Theater 2000.

It also is a movie that will make movie-goers think about a variety of ethical and societal issues in a way that most movies don't.  These issues are presented in a kind of naive, simplistic way but at least they're brought up.I really enjoyed the first two thirds of the movie but I must admit the last third fell a bit flat.  It's like they painted themselves in a corner that they couldn't get out of without creating an absurd, cheap ending that just didn't seem very plausible on any level.The acting by the principles was wonderful all around although I'm getting a little weary of Hurt's tired intellectual character.  I loved Gigolo Joe played by Jude Law and just wish they had used his character in a more meaningful way.  In many ways, he seemed just an extra character on the peripheral of the story.  The special effects were wonderful (what else?) but I'm glad it wasn't the entire focus of the movie.  I could really, really see the Kubrick touches and was delighted by that.

In my opinion, most underrated yet one of greatest movies of all time. Perhaps, it needs another time to be appreciated as it really is - A PURE MASTERPIECE!",A.I. Artificial Intelligence
370,kmberger,Watch. Process. Repeat.,8,2 October 2001,"A.I. is a film built on such an ambitious scale, and carried out with such care and structure, that it is virtually impossible to place it in its purest context after just one single viewing.Conceived years ago by Stanley Kubrick - who realized his limitations in creating the film and turned its care over to collaborator Steven Spielberg - A.I. is a film that seems as though it has been patiently waiting for us to be ready to see it, rather than waiting to finally be made. 
Presented as a drama in three acts, this is a complexly rendered landscape of not-so-distant futuristic possibility, where a grieving family can turn to technology to replace a lost son, and where robots are just part of the everyday environment.As with most of Kubrick's science fiction projects, A.I. evokes a harsh, dystopian future where the surface of the world is clean and sheer and shiny with newness and perfection, but just beneath that veneer is a darkness that seemingly is inevitable with evolution.  The sexual android (Jude Law), and the Flesh Fair are perfectly Kubrickian inventions.But this is not a Kubrick film - Spielberg's touch is evident in the emotional care he sets up for the replacement boy David (superbly played by the uncannily talented Haley Joel Osment), and the deft touch he has in showing the boy more and more of a world he was never supposed to know existed.Again, however, this is not simply a Spielberg film - the story is far too wide-ranging to be labeled so simply.  The false first ending - a stark, wrenching finale to David's quest - addresses the transient nature of the world, while focusing on the permanence of the 'soul', even as you are wholly convinced this machine does indeed have such a thing.  And finally, as the film winds its way patiently to it's quasi-mystical, near-religious ending - a far more rewarding and uplifting finale - the entire journey is given a focus and a power that a lesser filmmaker (or two lesser filmmakers), would never have dared conceive.So watch A.I. and marvel at the techniques and storytelling prowess of two of the medium's masters at their finest influence.  Then wait awhile, and give it a second look. And a third.  And watch as it evolves before your eyes, showing more and more of an incredibly engaging story.",A.I. Artificial Intelligence

His attempts of finding blue fairy become annoying. Because I knew that's not gonna happen. A robot can cry. I don't know how this happened. Robot who doesn't have need to get charged every day.

374,SammyK,Artificial Kubrick or Kubrick Lite,7,1 July 2001,"My impression of the first 2 hours of Kubrick's posthumous collaboration with Spielberg was generally a positive one. Skillfully, Spielberg employed his trademark melodrama and managed to create a convincing family portrait wrought with tragedy and a moral dilemma.  Haley Joel Osment is quite good, if effectively creepy in the role of David, the boy-robot. Unfortunately, the Kubrickian elements are either drowned out by Spielberg's melodramatic touches, or they appear to be haphazardly placed in between.  Take for instance the vision of Rouge City and the Flesh Fair - both containing dark undertones of societal decay, and transgressive cyberpunk eroticism.  I guess the problem is the inability of the two elements at work to merge cohesively into a whole.  Nevertheless, the plot is sustained enough for the first two hours to keep both Kubrick and Spielberg fans interested.  There are also the impressive acting skills of Jude Law in the role of Gigolo Joe, who approaches the role with great flair and intensity (at times reminiscent of the giddy Alex in A Clockwork Orange). The science fiction palette of a not-too distant future is another high point.  Vistas of a drowned Manhattan or the erotically charged Rouge City are breathtaking. Unfortunately, things run amuck when the film comes to a satisfying, if depressing conclusion.  This is acceptable, if more along Kubrickian lines.  Just when one expects the credits to roll, Spielberg turns a full 180 degrees here and slaps on a thirty-minute coda that is both unsatisfying, and insulting to the audience.  It is as if Spielberg were asserting himself over Kubrick's influence, bringing back the aliens from Close Encounters for a cameo appearance and slapping on an illogical and saccarine-sweet ending. I'm sure Kubrick is rolling in his grave. Oh, and one other thing - what are Chris Rock and Robin Williams doing in this movie?",A.I. Artificial Intelligence
375,brijess-2,Very Uneven,4,31 January 2003,"I sat down to A.I. expecting a movie full of wonder and amazement. I got that at times. At other times, I wanted to turn it off. When it was finally over, I really wanted to like this film but I just felt like I was in a ship on stormy seas and was seasick from it all.The movie starts out in a very somber tone. It explains how the earth is suffering the effects of global warming and the creation of robots, specifically one who can love. David, the loving Robot, is purchased by a family whose own son is on life support. Soon enough, the son improves and the mother decides she doesn't need David anymore. So she drops David and Teddy (the best and warmest character in the movie) in the woods and David goes on a journey to become a real boy and to earn the love of his mother.This is a very sad way to start the film, but it is then that we start to see a little of a ""quest"" in the movie (a la Wizard of Oz) and it begins to feel magical. Then, we get depressed again as we are introduced to a ""pleasure robot"" and how a woman is afraid of his ""functional abilities."" This totally lurches the movie from a kind of magical quality to in your face smut. Then, we see a ""flesh fair"" in which defective robots are destroyed in an arena to the delight of the humans. Then, we are taken to a city which has buildings in the shapes of women in provocative poses. I knew this was a pet project of Kubrick but I didn't know a lot of his perverted imagery and characters would be included in the film. Once we get past that, then we have a few more magical moments and then we are introduced to more dark images and finally, more magical moments. By the time it is all over, I was exhausted. Did I like the movie? I liked the Spielberg ""moments"" but I disliked the Kubrick ones. This maybe what they had intended but to me, it made for a very uneven and overall unsatisfying film.",A.I.

376,votarus4,"A.I. -- WELCOME TO THE DARK SIDE, MR. SPIELBERG.",10,5 July 2001,"(SPOILERS!)  A masterpiece, pure and simple.  From New York to Chicago to LA, reviews for this film have been schizoid, shallow, sophomoric at best. A.I., the darkest Sci-Fi film of all time, is about one thing, and one thing only:  The planet itself has decreed the extinction of the human race; and Mother Nature gets what she wants.  Spielberg never, ever veers off course in his brilliant script.  Directorial execution, likewise, is flawless.  The episodic structure of A.I. is a metaphor for EVOLUTION, cruel, omnipotent, forceful.  It goes where it must.  ""Metaphor"" is the key to analysis of A.I. Every character, every setting represents layer upon layer of meaning. Mommy rejecting David is EARTH rejecting our ""electronic"" selves (the ying/yang out of balance, etc.).  Daddy -- MAN -- who can no longer protect his children (from our electronic selves?).  The very meaning of childhood is perverted -- Martin is awakened from a coma, despite his atrophied legs, to satisfy perverse, unsatisfiable, parental needs.  Can David, a creature who doesn't need food, who lies there quietly, but never sleeps, who never really ""depends"" on anything, really answer the call of grieving parents? Everything is out of balance.  Gigolo Joe and Rouge City are obvious stand-ins for EROTICISM, the new religion.  Destroying rogue ""mechas"" is the new blood sport; the puny human way of declaring superiority to . . . what? Circuitry?  Other metaphors abound:  Professor Hobby (William Hurt.  The actor awakes at last!)-- represents our intellectual selves completely removed from spirit.  Even the ocean in A.I. has meaning(s) -- particularly, amniotic fluid -- the planet must give birth to something BETTER than human. David, trapped for 2,000 years under water, ""excavated"" by evolved machines, still searching for Mommy's approval (Well, our inner children know what that means).  Lastly, the ending -- a tautological equation loop -- the creatures (evolved mechas, including David) are caught in an endless effort trying to answer the unanswerable -- ""Where did we come from?  Who created us?  Is there a meaning?""  The mechas will be no more successful in their search than were the living, from whom they descended.  How long will the planet put up with ""THEM""?

For my money, A.I. is the most important Sci-Fi thesis on film in 50 years (i.e., the classic atomic/red scare theme of ""Day the Earth Stood Still"").  As for Haley Joel Osment, the screen hasn't seen that kind of purity of acting since the silent days of Garbo and Chaplin.

My favorite example is `Barry Lyndon'. eing the adventures of a young man, handsome, virtuous, well-meaning, ambitious, full of promise, etc. Yet in every scene, the camera `pulls-back' revealing Barry (but never to himself) to be womanizing, self-absorbed, criminally inclined, socially inept, not very bright, morally bankrupt, and at last, a broken shell of a man.

And Humans, the ultimate A.I. protagonist, seem blissed-out, in denial, more interested in creating `Davids', `Darlenes' and `Gigolo Joes' than in rising water levels and the imminent threat of extinction. Therefore, I believe A.I. is getting precisely the response all Kubrick films `initially' get.

381,epsilon3,A great movie trying to get out,7,24 March 2002,"A.I. is a difficult film. Some of it is brilliant, while some is dire.The acting - Haley Joel Osment as David the mecha (robot) boy is superb. He plays the role with such intelligence and maturity - it's a real achievement and bodes well for his future (if he can avoid hitting the self destruct button like so many other child stars.) Jude Law puts in another solid performance as 'Gigolo Joe' the mecha prostitute. In a similar vein to his previous roles in Gattaca and eXistenZ, he's quirky and somehow detached from reality - it works brilliantly.  He's rapidly turning into one of my favourite actors. ""Hey Joe - Waddya know?""The rest of the cast is very good but doesn't shine, perhaps because their characters were treated lightly and not fully explored. Overall though - good performances by all.The sets , costumes and special effects are of a very high standard. Until the last 30 minutes or so, the use of computer graphics is tastefully done and never feel like an excuse to wow the audience with some clever CGI. The scenes at the Flesh Fair (a kind of rock concert where mecha are destroyed for the entertainment of spectators) are powerful, visceral and in your face. The flying and underwater scenes were also very well handled, although not mind blowing. Now the downside, and it's a big downside. The plot is incredibly disjointed. I didn't expect it to be so obvious that this movie had been directed by two different people and thought Spielberg to be more subtle. There was apparently little attempt by Spielberg to blend his parts of the movie with Kubrick's to create a coherent whole. Instead what we get is a wonderfully dark first 60-90 minutes and then something reminiscent of 'Close Encounters of the E.T. kind' tacked on to make us feel good. As a result, the feel of the film quickly evaporated into a mush. There were a couple of chances to end the movie earlier (notably at the end of the underwater section) and it was a mistake to take the movie beyond these points. The poignancy is lost with repeated attempts to extend and explain the story in unnecessary ways, the scene with David's mother towards the end being especially contrived and saccharin. The sum up, this felt like two movies in one - an intelligent, dark and fascinating film mixed one that's formulaic, sentimental and cheesy. Because of this it fails to reach the promised heights and at times feels messy. It's ultimately unsatisfying and left me very disappointed, but not because it's bad, but rather because I expected so much more. As many others have said, I can't help wondering what heights it would have reached if Kubrick hadn't passed away.An interesting film, but rent it first as it's not for everyone.",A.I.

He wishes his mother to come back so he gets his wish.Aliens come down from above to populate the abandoned Earth to give the boy his wish.

But I like Spielberg pictures, and A.I. is not a Spielberg film bur a Stanley Kubrick film, which is something altogether different. Spielberg inherited the project from Kubrick and that explains the failure, because he tried to make a mixture of E.T. and 2001.The first part of the film is charming, in the same way that E.T. was charming, and the second part tried not to be cryptic, as Kubrick would have made it, and it ended in confusion. The character of the ""mecha"" child is charming, and so is the boy actor who plays it, But what the devil was that Teddy bear?. Perhaps Spielberg needed it, but the film did not. The gaudy ""Flesh Fair"" of the second part is too long, too noisy and not very credible. The mecha gigolo that escorts the boy through that part is definitely repugnant, the introduction of fairy tale  elements is an act of desperation on the part of a filmaker who doesn't know what to do next with his characters. And the boy... Will he be destroyed? Is he condemned to live forever in a state of loneliness? Steven Spielberg found a magnificent climax for his first creature in need of love: E.T.

It can sticky glue watchers with their sofas.The story is adapted from a well-know fairy tale. It is mixed with happiness and sadness. However, the story after 2,000 years is twisted a watcher's mood and emotion. For me, the wonderful film is became 'What the hack is it'. High-tech aliens arrived and woke the robot. This one is still watchable. But, did an alien said 'a resurrected human can be live only one day then die'? Well, the question was left here. Is the mother resurrected (a clone) or digitalized. Is she a simulation in the robot processor, which is the aliens rendered? or else?It similar to 'The Birds' by Alfred Hitchcock; a good movie but leaves no explanation.

Every point, every dramatic moment, is hammered home with a 20-pound sledgehammer. The Pinocchio references get so overdone and annoying that you want to scream ""Enough, Steve!  Enough!  We get it!

Very entertaining and good food for thought about what might actualy happen someday in the future, almost the definition of good, solid science fiction.

At every point where it starts to get ridiculous, they rescue it with a reasonable turn. I never did figure out why spinach brought the android to a grinding halt, but hours at the bottom of the swimming pool left it unaffected. I will just have to break out the electrical engineering books on that one. So what did the movie say? Unrequited or unacknowledged love can last for thousands of years if you are a robot? We all want to be rescued from loneliness by the blue fairy? Poor Osment had to pine for two thousand years; the average abused child learns hatred in less time than it took to make AI. In some ways, it wasn't a very smart robot. Life is a solitary phenomenon no matter how we try to share it with others, even as that sharing is all there is in the end. I liked the idea that it isn't very nice to blow up robots in an arena sporting event. If we can get professional ""wrestling"" to treat humans like humans, and we can gets humans to treat animals with dignity, can we be too far from treating the toaster (or a robot) with a little respect? Maybe we can start with opening car doors carefully in parking lots and saving some poor Taurus a few dents.",A.I. Artificial Intelligence
392,PHASEDK,Way too clever and emotive.,10,5 September 2008,"Ai was shown on UK's BBC again recently, and I was again enthralled, in fact.. moved more than I wanted to be by the first story. This film is in three parts, and I can imagine, as in the old days of theatre, many people walked out thinking thats the end, to beat the hoards leaving, and missed the final part of it. Spielberg we know if a master of tugging heart strings. I wasn't and still am not an ET fan.. but Spielberg knows what hes doing. I was going to comment straight away but got caught up in the varying other comments on this site. Some people don't want to have to think. They want entertainment, well, unless you are a sci fi freak.. who loves fantasy, this isn't for you. It IS one of the most spectacularly made spectacles of film making, I'm surprised he didn't include a kitchen sink somewhere.. as he did the moon, which I realised is a trade mark. I've marked this with spoiler in case I mention something. Yes, the first story.. well, it has holes. The family doesn't know what will happen to its cryogenic son so Hubby decides to bring home the new android boy his company has worked on. Full marks to leading lady for the emotional roller coaster ride.. taking me with her. It was nearly too much. WHAT does one do.. what a dilemma. I felt for her.. but.. oh dear, the phone call.. sonny jim is recovering. What of the android.. hes been programmed/mentally etched now. Oh dear. Of course sonny jim plays tricks.. hes that age, it isn't going to work.. so.. at least Teddy is there too. Thats so well done I could not 'see the joins'. Story two, the mechs are of course a threat to some of society. THEY are being whipped up into a frenzy of fear, much as the public are NOW.. in the real world about various things, my goodness this is true to life, so.. racism rears its head. Adventures as David tries to find his dream.. who will make him human. Glorious sets of a pleasure city. His android friend romeo is on the run but becomes a friend. I felt for David all the way along the line. I knew this was part influenced by Kubrick, forgot Spielberg had taken it over. If this is the case and Kubrick hadnt put the end piece on, I'm not sure it would have worked so well. Part three David thinks hes found his angel and talks to her.. over and over until his power runs out.. Narration.. how many years pass and some alien craft is seen ... we've already seen Manhatten under water. I didn't see the twin towers but noticed tall towers broken in the middle and leaning.. I think that was a comment. The aliens, I got slightly confused.. David is the last of his kind that had contact with humans. So who were these Aliens. They reactivate him and there IS a nice end.. that worked for me. Spielbergs happy ending. I know I preferred it that way but how many cinema goers missed the end? My Dad used to wait for the credits and so did I. Dad was in am dram.. and I learned production from an early age. I'm so glad as I have an appreciation now. As long as cgi is not noticeable.. fine. I'll no doubt watch this again and again and see more each time. A firm favourite, as is K's 2001. Considering its age...OK, with Nasas help.. but.. K TOOK us into space.. as in reality. And the recent dvds HAVE the docus on too.. AT LAST.",A.I. Artificial Intelligence
393,PandoraProductions4,an underrated masterpiece,10,23 October 2014,"Here is a film that rises above the average.Everything about it from the story and the acting, to the music and the visual effects, is wonderfully done.It was directed by Steven Spielberg and was the brainchild of Stanley Kubrick, so that's enough for it to be worth watching by itself.But the film is so much more. For one thing it raises so many moral and ethical questions, so it inspires much more thought then a standard science fiction flick.Haley Joel Osment (The Sixth Sense) gives an inspired performance as the robot boy, David. He wonderfully portrays the way the robot progresses throughout the film: making the eventual change from stiff machine to being practically human.There are great supporting roles by Jude Law and William Hurt. Jude Law's graceful physicality recalls Gene Kelly's performance in ''Singing In the Rain'', and William Hurt plays the grief stricken and obsessed scientist very well indeed.The film, like many of Kubrick's, is divided into three parts.The first part mostly takes place in the sterile house where David is taken after he is created. In this section simple emotions are explored: love, happiness, jealously, and resentment.In the second part of the film, David goes on a journey throughout the world. The strong colours of the Flesh Fair and Rouge City, are in stark contrast to the subdued shades of David's old home. The second half represents more the physical side of life; it is loud and carnal, with lots of fleshy and boisterous happenings.The third and shortest part of the film explores the mind. It is not clear how much of what's being shown is actually happening and how much is in David's head.The entire film feels like a dream, constantly shifting, changing pace and tone. It's incredible moving, and visually stunning.This is filmmaking of the highest order.",A.I. Artificial Intelligence
394,Geordie-4,Great except for the last 20 minutes,9,9 July 2001,"I thought this was an excellent film.  Haley Joel Osment is an amazing kid. I don't know how he is able to portray people with such emotion and depth. The kid is a genius.  I found that the film was essentilaly about whether or not robots can become real.  It also examined the ability of humans to love and whether their love is contingent on something.  If this film is to be believed, humans are not capable of loving robots unconditionally.  As Joe (Jude Law) says to David (Osment), robots are made for specific purposes. If they don't fulfill those purposes, or if they become more intelligent than their makers, or if they outsmart them, they are discarded like so much scrap metal and plastic.  They are not loved as people.  Indeed, it would seem that is unrealistic.  They are not people.  They are robots.  no matter how sensitive or intelligent they might be, or how smart their creators, they are still not human.  It made this film and David's sadness that much more poignant.  Although he yearned for the love that he believed had solely been given to Patrick (his owners' real son), it seemed that he wouldn't receive it.  The story of Pinocchio inspired him.  It seemed though, that his desire for humanity and unconditional love, would be thwarted when he ended up finding the blue fairy which made Pinocchio into a real boy as he froze under the ice that came from the flooding of the earth and the freezing of the polar ice caps.  However, although his quest appeared thwarted, Spielberg undermined the seemingly hopeless quest David embarked on.  This ruined a tremendously rich film; rich in ideas such as love, jealousy, artificial intelligence (obviously), and neglect.  Kubrick's cold remoteness is much in evidence in Janusz Kaminski's photography.  John Williams' score does not intrude on the melancholy nature of the film, and Jude Law is coldly charismatic as the machine who satisfies women who otherwise could not be satisfied.  This is a tremendous film, also with incredible special effects and the best, most sensible use of special effects, which is unfortunately somewhat compromised by a sentimental ending.",A.I.

395,Dave-430,"Stevo, you've let me down!",2,21 October 2001,"I went into the theater with a serious hangover and the less than impressive reviews in mind. Still my trust in Steven Spielberg (I chose to write off The Lost World as a slip) prompted me to expect solid entertainment if nothing more. In fact my attitude was so positive that it took more than half of this overlong film for me to realize that I'd been had. It was about that time that my companions wanted to leave the building, but I was foolish enough to want to see how it all turned out. Let me make one thing clear: A.I. does not explain the things you don't understand - it just throws in some more inexplicable elements. It goes on like this throughout, culminating with one of the silliest and unsatisfying endings in movie history. I am not exaggerating when I say that this one is in serious competition with The Lost World and Battlefield Earth for the prize of worst big time Hollywood production in recent history. What can you say about a movie whose most convincing character is a talking teddy bear? The only thing that keeps me from giving A.I. a 1 is the stunning fx - they really are incredible. Who would have thought that Steven Spielberg could be responsible for two of the three dumbest movies ever. I still regard him as one of the greats, and I look forward to Minority Report with Tom Cruise; my only hope is that it won't turn out to be as foolish as sitting through all of A.I.",A.I.

396,bLuR-7,A must-watch!,10,1 April 2007,"Labours of love don't get any more poetic than Steven Spielberg's flawed masterpiece 'A.I. Artificial Intelligence'. Part science fiction, part fairy tale, AI takes us on a fantastical journey across a bleak yet hauntingly beautiful futuristic landscape, where robots are created with an uncanny ability to mimic human emotions -- including that most contentious of feelings, love. The movie polarised audiences upon its releases, with many people seeing the film as a disjointed mix of Spielbergian schmaltz and Kubrickian stoicism (Spielberg directed the film based on a concept he developed with the late Stanley Kubrick). But despite all its shortcomings, including a tacked-on second ending, AI remains a near-perfect piece of cinema, a thought-provoking work that is a must-watch for any filmmaker worth his salt.",A.I.

397,experten,"Unusual, thought provoking, visually stunning, entertaining and well made movie",8,10 February 2002,"Positive aspects: A.I. is an unusual movie with an original story, it is not a typical Hollywood movie even though it is made by Spielberg, the Hollywood icon (and that is why it was not a boxoffice success, it is too intelligent and too tragic). A.I. is also visually stunning with excellent performances from the actors, especially Haley Joel Osment (who was so brilliant in the Sixth Sense) but also Jude Law are very good. It is a movie for adults and it contains disturbing scenes. (I.e. the scenes were humans are making a show out of destroying humanoid robots reminded me of Romeros' Dawn of the Dead and Savinis' remake of Night of the Living Dead.) There are also some scenes that are absurdly humoristic (I was laughing at the teddybear). You will see New York like you have never seen it before (very impressive) and hopefully never will in real life.The plot is well made and thought provoking. I know that some reviewers on IMDB do not share my opinion on this (or pretend that they don't) but I think most of them are real snobs who are comparing A.I. with how they think the movie would have been if Stanley Kubrick would have made it, the kind of people who say that they don't like the excellent Saving Private Ryan and who thinks that The Duel is Spielbergs best movie (Because it was low budget, not so commercial etc. Sure it was good, but it was not logical as far as I can remember and it was not an important movie, just a good thriller). The sheer number of people who has written reviews of A.I. is also an indication of the importance of this movie, it has emotional impact, you will not forget this movie soon after you have seen it.The movie is very good from the beginning (the scenes involving William Hurt are impressive) and the pacing is good through most of the movie (but not towards the end). It is also possible to make a comparison between the humans treatment of the robots with the nazi Holocaust (and Spielberg is jewish I believe).Negative aspects: I felt it was about half an hour too long. The ending felt tucked on and was unnecessary. Sometimes Spielberg tends to be too sentimental and he has a weakness for the supernatural which shows during the ending of the movie (thankfully only in the ending).Final comment: The ending is the weakest point, but I felt that there are two earlier moments in the movie were it could have ended and if it had the movie would have been better so I just pretend that it did. I think the ending was tucked on as a crowd pleaser but it is not a total disaster since it is not without tragic. It could have been worse. This is a must see, some love it some hate it, no one is indifferent. Rating: 8 / 10",A.I. Artificial Intelligence

399,wdbasinger,One of the worst Spielberg Movies,2,18 May 2005,"Steven Spielberg has written some great movies in the past such as Close Encounters and Schindler's List, but this is not one of them. I never came out of a movie feeling so depressed as I did from this one since I saw ""Soylent Green"" (one of the sickest SF films I have ever seen) a couple of decades ago. Even the terrible ""Soldier"" with Kurt Russell wasn't this bad. And I am a die-hard SF fan !!Spielberg can't seem to go beyond the cliché characterizations of adults being totally dysfunctional in their relationships with each other, and with their environment. For example, fathers are always irresponsible, absent, or distant. The children always seem to be in some dream world existence (e.g. ""Poltergeist"", ""E.T.""). (By the way, I thought ""E.T."" was a great movie). One could possibly consider ""A.I"" to be some synthesis of Pinnochio with E.T. Beyond that, there seems to be nothing to redeem this film, because as things turn out, people in the film seem to be totally unredeemable.On the subject of machine intelligence, ""2001: A Space Odyssey"", ""Android"", ""Collosus: The Forbin Project"", ""Star Wars"", and ""Creation of the Humanoids"", (all top-notch, excellent movies) treat the subject with much more sophistication and, well, intelligence. This movie ""A.I"" has no real scientific foundation at all. The story of a thinking, feeling android searching for love through the centuries never finding it leaves one with a deep feeling of sadness, if not depression.The only redeeming aspect of this movie is Osment's acting.Dan Basinger",A.I.

401,zaremskya-23761,"Thoughtful, sad, dreamy.",8,18 April 2018,"Originally a dream from the brilliant Stanley Kubrick, A.I. is a great bit of Science Fiction. It dwells on powerful and human themes from the perspective of the mechanical. This is the main goal of the film, to explore and examine what makes us human with beings that are almost, but not quite. The protagonist, who is done justice by Haley Joel Osment's great performance, has all the characteristic's of a human child, and has even been programmed to feel love and attach to other humans. A curious characteristic for a machine. The film revolves around his quest to become human so he can fully love, not just be programmed to love, as he wants to be with his adopted human mother.This major theme carries the film well. There is the standard flair of flashy Sci-Fi and adventure, but the theme of love is so all-pervading, warm, and powerful, that you cannot escape it. It guides the characters just like any other film, despite the fact that they are machines. That is the magic here, and the gift of Spielberg, to take powerful themes and explore them in ways no other filmmaker can. The result is very effective.",A.I. Artificial Intelligence

403,constructionbob,Love is Dangerous,9,21 July 2001,"Oh wow.  This movie...I'm not certain how coherent my review of it's going to be, because this was a maddening film to watch.  I loved most of it-it set up a believable world, where the relationships between man and machine/God and man are paralleled brilliantly.  And the questions it forces one to ask out of that are not easily answered, as I also enjoy.  Do we really want that kind of power-to be able to grant something that close to the yearning of real life, without giving that life the ability to adapt or let go?  And what does that say about our own existence-if we someday find that we, like David, are not as unique as we once had thought?It was the questions about Love that really had me reeling, however.  Can it really be manufactured/implanted like that?  Are the feelings and pleasures of Love worth its dear, great cost?  And is that kind of love perhaps even greater than our own-because it does not give up, does not let go, past what it knows is realistic.  I can't even explain most of what this film put into my head, but suffice it to say it is mind-boggling for the most part.The ending, however-I don't want to give away spoilers, and I know the creatures in question are meant to be mechas, not CE3K aliens, but it still is too pat, too easy.  It attempts to put a semi-happy closure to what should not be a happy ending for David.  They had a couple of earlier parts where they could have ended it and it would have been perfect-you'll see what I mean when you see it.Thought-provoking, brutal, pretentious (in a somewhat good way), artistic, beautiful-all words came to my mind throughout the running time.  See it for yourself, and see better what I mean.  Not everything comes out well in words.P.S. I agree with that reviewer who was wondering where the Religious Right was in picketing this movie-it has more mocking of religion and God in general than the whole of Dogma, or Monty Python's Life of Brian.  I suppose that since this is sci-fi, it went off people's spiritual radars.  Well, forget that-if you have faith, you need to see this movie, to see some of the upcoming thought about God.  It is a deeply spiritual movie-just watch out for it in some of those 'throwaway' lines by Gigolo Joe and such.",A.I. Artificial Intelligence
404,Momcat_of_Lomita,"I liked it, but not sure I can recommend it.",6,7 July 2011,"First the good news: This movie has a lot going for it.It has Haley Joel Osment. He's the make-or-break actor in this movie, and I believe he did an incredible job in a very tough role, all the tougher when you consider that much of what he did involved acting on a ""green screen"" stage. He makes you love him while at the same time you want him to not be such a perfect loving child because you know he's going to get hurt-- even though that shouldn't be possible, and shouldn't matter since he's not human. Should it?It has Jude Law in a part that seems in some ways almost a throw-away to the plot of the movie, but that is done so well it stays with you. I find Jude Law an incredibly charismatic actor with great versatility and unexpected talents; as ""Gigolo Joe"" the adult entertainment ""mecha"", he's incredible, capering and literally dancing from appointment to appointment, both impersonal and incredibly personally intimate as the perfect love machine-- literally.It has some incredible special effects that create new and believable times and places that make you want to explore them further when the movie ends. To me, that's one of the tests of a movie's successfulness: does it take me to a place where I can immerse myself in an alternate reality that isn't awkward or jarring? This movie does that-- sometimes.It is visually in many ways a stunning movie in its concepts and their execution.That's the good stuff. The not-so-good stuff: it isn't cohesive enough in plot and story for the viewer to really understand what it's about.On one level, it's the ""Pinocchio"" story, updated and explored from a slightly different angle. You have the ""puppet"" who is made so real that ultimately he wants to be real, and cannot stand the pain of knowing he isn't a real boy. And he goes through his odyssey like Pinocchio, in a series of adventures like Pinocchio had, that carry lessons/information he needs to assimilate or to show how in his imperfection as a ""puppet"" trying to be a boy, he's in some ways more perfect than the real thing.On another level, it's an exploration of the pain and love of the parent/child relationship, and the power of that connection, particularly the connection between mother and child, and whether there can be, or should be, a surrogate for a real child when a real child isn't available.And on a very superficial level, it's something of a morality play about how imperfect humans behave savagely when confronted by the perfection of machines that are programmed to be people who are more perfect than people ever can be.And it's all interesting, in an episodic way, but it doesn't fit together. It's like riding in a car with a manual transmission and a driver who hasn't figured out how to coordinate the controls yet. It moves forwards in fits and starts and with much lurching and grinding of gears, and occasionally the engine is roaring at full throttle while the wheels aren't going anywhere.I enjoyed this movie while at the same time feeling great frustration. It didn't deliver me to the destination it seemed headed for and the ride there was occasionally very bumpy and unpleasant. But the scenery at times was astounding, and the actors delivered performances that made me willing to forgive a lot.But in the end, I think many people will find this movie too flawed for pure entertainment. If you want to sit down cold and watch a movie that takes you from beginning to end with a smooth flow of events and impetus that's always moving in the direction it promises, you are not going to feel this movie delivers. But you may, at the same time, feel glad you watched it anyway.I particularly enjoyed the ending, which is about wish-fulfillment and finally finding that perfect, unflawed, unconditional happiness and shared love, even if it took more than a thousand years of waiting and the end of mankind to get there, and it only lasted for a day. It was the realization that maybe a single day of perfection in love makes a thousand years or more of darkness and stasis and the collapse of everything around you into chaos worthwhile. Maybe if you have the faith to believe that that kind of love is possible, and you get it for a single day, it cancels out all the pain and unbearableness of what's come before it. Wouldn't it be nice to believe in a world that eventually makes everything right and wonderful and worthwhile in one day, one stunningly perfect day that meets your expectations unconditionally and flawlessly?It's a sweet thought and a sweet ending, but it's unsatisfying: because the way that Osment's ""Pinocchio"" achieves his single perfect day, we know it's really an illusion arranged for him out of pity and an abstract curiosity by literal alien entities that observe it all with a sense of detachment as a sort of laboratory experiment. In the end it isn't real even though it is, because it happened through deus ex machina. Does that count?I've watched this film several times now and there are parts of it that are so good that it frustrates me that in the end, the parts are better than the movie as a whole. So I say: if you're looking for a straightforward entertainment movie that takes a story and tells it well and smoothly, you aren't going to like ""A. I. Artificial Intelligence."" But if you're the kind of viewer who can forgive the picture's overall flaws because you're happy that there are some incredible parts, I think you'll be glad you spent the time with this movie.",A.I.

Not living up to its press is something that is all too apparent. Originally a Stanley Kubrick idea, this movie was still in embryonic form at the time of his death. Steven Spielberg decided to let this idea blossom. Come away from this feeling vaguely empty and you could be forgiven. Osment, as usual, provides an excellent performance for his age and this shows that 'The Sixth Sense' was not an act of luck.

412,Rebochan,Oscar Material...a cinematic masterpiece,10,5 July 2001,"WARNING: THIS REVIEW CONTAINS SPOILERS!  READ AT YOUR OWN RISK!I went into A.I. not knowing quite what to expect.  I had already read the short-story the film was based on and had heard there was controversy about the movie's ending, and I've recently watched several otherwise good films where the ending killed it.  This film was simply astounding from beginning to end.  Spielburg seemed to have his usual trademarks of cranking up the emotions toned WAY down, and many scenes that could have been overdone were much more subtle.  Subtlety is something that one rarely finds in films these days.  A.I. takes the viewer on a horrific yet fantastic ride that starts off very Spielburgian and ends up in the bizarre realm of Stanley Kubrick, making the transition very seamlessly.  Since this film's story is pretty well-known, I won't waste time by telling it again.  But the ending that is causing so much controversy left me in awe of how far I'd come since the beginning of the film.  People insist that the movie is asking questions that it can't answer, but that's the point-the answers must lie within ourselves, not the film.  Also, some say that it should have ended with David praying to the Blue Fairy and getting no answer.  That would have been a cop-out, though, and indeed, it almost seemed as though it WAS going to end there.  This would have wrecked the film!  There'd have been nothing worth ending with then.  However, David's final existence and the fate of the humans 2000 years later seems very Kubrickian.  I found that I could keep at least a slight grasp of what was going on, but I believe that because of the territory this film covers, one viewing isn't enough.  I'll be watching it again when it comes out on DVD (watching a DVD is much cheaper than paying for another movie ticket).  Haley Joel Osment deserves an Oscar for his performance.  He is a very talented young actor who carries the entire weight of the film on his shoulders and does so with the skill of actors several times his age.  I hope that he does even more wonderful movies as he grows older.",A.I. Artificial Intelligence

I mean c'om! This movie is like 3 movies in one. One is about living in a human family as a robot. One is a Pinocchio rip off. The final one is him with a bunch of idiot aliens from Close Encounters of the Third Kind. Hailey Osment acted very well... and Jigelo Joe was kind of cool, and the beginning of the movie was good. That's pretty much it. I think this movie is over and under rated because it is a Spielberg movie. People who think it wasn't a great movie (like me) is maybe because we we're expecting something better... another E.T or 2001. Other people might just like it because it is a Spielberg movie.My total rating is 5/10",A.I. Artificial Intelligence

Had the movie ended with David praying to the statue at underwater Coney Island, I would have given this movie a 9.*SPOILERS END*Instead, the dopey ending dropped the movie's rating three whole points, and I walked out feeling disappointed and rather angry at Spielberg for tampering with Kubrick's vision of how this movie should be.",A.I.

415,reel_emotion,Mankind vs. Technology Movie,7,9 April 2003,"***Spoilers***A lot has been written here about A.I., and I'm not sure what I can add. I do like it, but there are a few flaws.I happened to see an episode of the old sci-fi series, Night Gallery, that had a similar story to A.I, but told it in less time. The story was about a husband and wife (played by Cloris Leachman) who keep abusing their robot maid and breaking her. They bring her back into the shop for another model, but this time the maid kills the couple. In the end, we find out that the robots have taken over the factory. They now make and sell each other, gradually taking over the human race.The Night Gallery story, while showing that the humans were bad, also show the possibility of robots taking over . . . on purpose. I think A.I. leans too heavily on the side of orga (humans), bad; mecca (robots), good. The anti-mecca people were ultimately correct: we became extinct and the mecca survived. But A.I. seems to point to our stupidity for our demise: could it be environmental problems caused by pollution that only robots could survive? In A.I., we see how the humans misjudge the mecca: blaming Gigolo Joe for murder and blaming David for trying to drown Martin. But the mecca were capable of violence: David did destroy reading David in Dr. Hobby's office.The super mecca praise the human race, though. And Dr. Hobby seems to be shown in a good light for making such a creation as David. But wasn't he just a grieving father who wanted to replicate his dead son? Did Dr. Hobby ever think of the consequences of his creation? And why did Hobby let David wonder around when he was abandoned? Wasn't Hobby just as selfish as Monica? They were trying to make themselves feel better. In the scene in which David is being repaired after eating food, we see Monica clutching his hand, but she lets go of it when David says that it doesn't hurt Mommy--realizing that David is not human. And Monica's husband is really quite hypocritical: he doesn't agree with having robots and is freaked out about it, but he works at a place that manufactures and sells robots.The mecca themselves even seem to recognize they are at war with humans. Teddy seems to be a wise sage who knows that he is not a toy. The other old mecca in the flesh fair cage says something about how humans are always trying to lower the number of mecca to increase their superiority.My two favorite scenes in the movie are David's abandonment and the flesh fair spectacle. When Monica takes David for a drive in the county, I thought about how people take their unwanted pets for ""a drive in the country."" We have become the ultimate disposable society. If we created mecca, maybe we would show a little humanity and responsibility for them. But no--we have the flesh fair boss who doesn't really care if technology has taken over--he just wants money. But all this still points to the fact that A.I. makes us the bad guy and robots victims.Still A.I. is destined to be a classic and definitely worth a look-see.",A.I. Artificial Intelligence

The sharp intellect and non-cliché of Kubrick is in complete contrast to Spielberg's soppy, sentimental cliché extravaganzas. The ending does away with all the cerebral handling of the theme of artificial intelligence and cooks a stew of Close Encounters cuddly aliens, fairies and resurrection superstition. Oh dear, what a mess! If you want brain exercise and uniqueness please see anything done by Kubrick and don't be mislead by the homage connection here.

418,lbk,Spielberg out of his depth,8,19 November 2004,"I have been wondering why this film didn't make it to the top. It was destined to be the new landmark in film history. The voting in IMDb is bell shaped with a top about 7-8. That's the publics definition of a mediocre film. Why? Nothing was spared. The cards were dealt for a film history event. Why did it fail??Because Steven Spielberg was out of his depth mentally.He ventured into a realm he does not have the talent to handle. Spielberg is the master of children's stories, crowd pleasers, cliché wallowing, tear jerking, emotional masturbating. He is the complete antithesis to Stanley Kubrick who is the master of intellect, innovation, originality. It is like expecting Santa Claus to master brain surgery. That does not make Santa Claus bad in his realm. It is just misguided.I have a dream.

Given the competence both behind and in front of the camera, it is hard to see how things went so wrong, or how Hollywood with all its test-screenings and feedback, has produced such a jumbled piece of work, which is all the worse for dragging on so long. Just when you think it's hit rock bottom, it finds new depths to sink to. I avoided this for months after hearing so much bad press & word of mouth, but even so I was astounded at how BAD it really was.

The movie's fairly gripping, scary and funny and Haley Joel Osment is unbelievable - simply amazing - an Oscar nomination must be guaranteed, and I hope Spielberg's humorous and compelling script is also nominated. John Williams creates the perfect score for this film and the ending is certainly no let down, although inevitably sentimental. There was so much in this movie and I know I'll enjoy it just as much a second or even third time. Within a summer of absolute crap, this stands out so high above everything else this year and even last year. It reminds me very much of the magic of Close Encounters, but it certainly isn't the landmark movie that Close Encounters was.

421,theojhyman,This deserves a re-release at Christmas,9,23 July 2001,"The fact that Spielberg's AI has not surpassed $100 million is probably because the majority of moviegoing people have become so used to mindless entertainment which doesn't require an ounce of brainwork to put things together or move things along in a film. AI is so much more intelligent that anything else around and the attention to detail, characters and cinematography could not be bettered. Nothing this year comes close to AI. It stands high up in a different league, and it's probably for that reason why it has flopped and certainly deserves a re-release later this year. Look at the blockbusters of the past couple months: Pearl Harbor, The Mummy Returns, The Fast and the Furious, Tomb Raider, Jurassic Park 3 - they just don't make 'em like they used to. These films destroy the name ""summer blockbuster"" as they don't even come close to blockbusters like ""Jaws"", ""Star Wars"" or ""ET"". The only thing that comes close to a classic blockbuster like those is Spielberg's AI. It bears many reminiscences to Close Encounters, and while it's not as compelling or groundbreaking, I hope it stands the test of time and becomes a landmark film in the history of Spielberg films. Go see it once and if you're disappointed, then go see it again - you'll appreciate it more the second time round. If you loved it the first time, you'll love it just as much the second time.

422,lists-9,Moving and Visually Spectacular,9,8 November 2005,"I love this film and have difficulty comprehending how some people can dismiss it as ""stupid"" or ""dumb"".Yes, it was sentimental and yes, at times the science seems to be lacking. (My main concern was how David's power source kept him running for thousands of years). However, it was visually stunning and surely - to most intelligent viewers - would provoke all kinds of questions about the nature of life, consciousness and being human. If David's love for his mother is artificial, does that make it any less valid? Does being created by humans make him less of a ""person"" than a human being, although he can think and feel? Do any of the mechas deserve the treatment they get, or should we not extend to them the compassion that ""living"" creatures (including most animals) usually get? Finally, isn't it a strength in a film if it provokes these kind of questions but doesn't attempt simple answers, leaving the audience to work out their own feelings about them?I felt there were no bad performances, with Haley Joel Osment and Jude Law as accomplished as ever. The ending was perhaps a little oversentimental, but I found it uplifting. It's certainly likely that Stanley Kubrick's version would have been more downbeat, but I've always considered him overrated: his cold and cynical view ruined at least one film for me and made another of his ""masterpieces"" unsatisfying.

424,Mikelito,Comparisons to Kubrick are a joke - form over substance yet again,3,29 December 2007,"Kubrick would have NEVER made a movie like this because it's way too slow, and far too dumb, sappy, tedious and schmaltzy. Having said that, in Hollywood terms, this is quite a risky movie because the essential message is quite unromantic and depressing. For once humans are not portrayed in an ultimately angelic way. When they are gone nothing is really missing. But I doubt Spielberg or his audience would notice that.Unfortunately Spielberg simply knows no better than putting a thick layer of sugar on everything. The guy can't help himself - he can be the most powerful producer/director and yet he just will not (allow himself to) make any intellectually challenging movies. Maybe he just can't.The principal mistake in this is all the overbearing simplistic emotion that drowns out anything interesting that could have very easily been said. Rather than just once really concentrating on that very interesting robot-human question the entire movie revolves around this boys affection for his supposed Mother. In other words: rather than finally producing something in the vein of Stanislaw Lem or Isaac Asimov, millions are spent on yet another version of Pinocchio... Terry Gilliam should have learnt from this - never do version number 1.393 of some fairy-tale (Quixote, Münchhausen, etc.) but do a thinly-veiled adaptation that fits an existing film cliché, add a kid or a dog and you can hope to cash in. Every twist and turn is another setup for another disgustingly schmaltzy scene which goes on forever and ever. Which is another difference to Kubrick - his lengths had reasons and were filled with information which you might use for something far out as ""thinking"" whereas every puny idea here is prolonged ad infinitum & nauseam until you don't care and just want the scene to finally be over. Rather than witnessing this self-pitying kid for 3 hours I'd have a little more information on those aliens or future beings. But this would have overstrained the authors. They were only only capable of dreadfully clichéd plot devices: Like resurrecting his Mum for a single day only. What, not 48 hours or 72? Alas who cares. It's all ultimately pointless and as long as it amateurishly helps the film to go on and END some time it's OK.Form over substance - special effects substitute ideas once again. Special effects cretins once again are having a field day with a 1.000 robots. How many of those robots do you have to see until they bore you? I'd say around three.I'm quite sick of today's SciFi which is really just a lame excuse for soap-opera quality melodrama and fake emotions. ""Sunshine"", ""Bicentennial Man"", the list is endless.In fact this is ""Bicentennial Man"" - just for a bigger audience because it doesn't feature an eternally 45-year-old but a (very supposedly) cute kid with no discernible eyes and his Teddy Bear. This had better been a TV movie with the weak mono-dimensional plot (artificial boy wants his mummy) it has. A condensed 30-minute Twilight Zone-type summary would have been more than enough.It's movies like this that only idiotize people through simplifying, lessening the need to think and cementing the dumbing down of society. But hopefully not before we've come up with a self-designing robot generation that will wipe out our increasing inability to be creative and retain any amount of dignity.

425,Calios,"Technically good, emotionally, well...",7,2 July 2001,"First let me say that this was a very well produced movie. The technical aspects were great and the affects of lighting and change in texture of some scenes were well done. But the story was hard to follow in some ways and sobering in others. The script could have used a little more work as the guy who was playing ""Dad"" (Henry?) changed his position or attitude or approach to the ""robot/child"" project when the going began to get rough. If he was going to switch stances, he could nix the whole deal right there after all he's the one who started this and thought it would be a good idea. This occurrence of a character's personality change has occurred in other Spielberg movies, but because the guy can make such a great movie otherwise it can be overlooked.The kid can act! The boy playing the robot nailed it pretty good. The ending is a big stretch and he went along, but hey being a robot his behavior was understandable. Jude Law did a great job too, as did the girl who played ""Mommy"". The trailers show a lot of the ""nanny"" robot, but she's only in one small sequence and deserved to be in more. The actress playing that role was engaging and should have had more to do with the story.

430,tightspotkilo,"If you don't like this movie, here's a suggestion...",8,15 August 2009,"I won't say people will either love this movie or they will hate it. I'm sure it breaks down that way to some extent, and the range of opinions expressed about the movie support that notion, but I'm nevertheless also sure there are those out there who are ambivalent or indifferent about it, neither loving or hating it. That's because I'm one who was ambivalent about it after I first saw it in 2001. There was much to like about the movie. Film makers par excellence, Stanley Kubrick and Steven Spielberg. Does it get any better than that? The cast was good too, all of it. Especially Haley Joel Osment. Production values galore. The film is beautifully rendered. But even with all that there was something about it that bothered me, even annoyed me, and whatever it was it got in the way of my enjoyment of it. So I dismissed this movie and didn't even think about again it for years. Recently it popped up on HBO. I took the opportunity to watch it again. I found myself not being as bothered by the movie as I was before. HBO being HBO, I watched it again. And then again. Now there is nothing about the movie I dislike or that bothers me. I now like this movie without reservation. I also figured out why I reacted the way I did in the initial viewing.My suggestion to those who don't like the movie is watch it again, and give it your thorough attention. Your opinion may change. For a couple of reasons.First, this is a very complex movie. There's a lot to take in, visually, cognitively, philosophically. I've now seen it four times and I don't believe I've yet absorbed all there is. We're talking Kubrick AND Spielberg here. That alone tells you this movie contains much to behold. I'm not of the school who believes that Spielberg mucked this up after Kubrick died. Yes, Kubrick nursed this project along for over 20 years, from initial writing and treatment through rewrite after rewrite. But it was Kubrick who hand-picked Spielberg to direct it, years before it finally was made, Kubrick leaving his indelible imprimatur, but Spielberg likewise leaving his too was always anticipated, including by Kubrick. Kubrick wanted Spielberg's touch on this movie. Nor do I believe the movie is ""20 minutes too long"". Those last 20 minutes are not just Spielberg schmaltz, they are important to the resolution of the story. Throughout the first 126 minutes of the movie we are asked in myriad ways to care about David. The last 20 minutes gives meaning to that caring. Without that conclusion there is no meaning, just a cold void.Which leads directly to the second reason why I recommend repeated viewings, and the explanation for my initial reaction. The story is about a robot designed and programmed to be just like a little boy, who wants to be a real little boy, and who literally spends thousands of years seeking the return of love from his human ""mother"" who he was programmed to bond with and love. That's the basis from which all manner of questions are asked and explored, about the meaning of love, humanity, and of existence itself. I submit that this storyline told that way --about a child-- ultimately overwhelms the emotional senses. It more than tugs at the heartstrings. It yanks at them. While we might care about the android Data on Star Trek, or about the robot Robin Williams plays in Bicentennial Man, both of which also want to be human, our caring for those ""adult"" robots is nothing compared to the caring we feel for the child David here. With an innocent child seeking his mother's love it all goes way over the top. Add to the mix that Haley Joel Osment played the role masterfully. With this recipe the movie bluntly manipulates our emotions, something it does too well. It becomes distracting and difficult to watch, let alone to process analytically. Think Bambi, but on steroids. Many of us just shut it down, saying to ourselves, ""I don't need this maudlin stuff in my life."" Thus affected, the viewer never appreciates the movie's rich themes because the shutdown blocks all that. What I found, however, is that subsequent viewings lessens the distracting effect, and the movie becomes much easier to watch and fully appreciate. Oddly, it appears that Kubrick and Spielberg knew exactly what they were toying with in this respect, and they did it intentionally. It is embedded in the story itself. The flesh fair's barker, as he was getting ready to destroy David, has to keep reminding the audience that David is only a machine, not a real boy, and he implores the audience to not allow their emotions to be manipulated by the machine's child-like appearance. As David tearfully pleads for his life the audience is swayed, giving David an opening to escape. The inner audience, the audience within the story, is is being manipulated the same way we in the outer audience, were being manipulated. This must be a conceit by intent and design.As a child actor Haley Joel Osment was nonpareil. The Sixth Sense told us that. This was his last role as a child, and after this he became a different actor (see e.g., Secondhand Lions). Puberty did that. His career as an adult actor is just now beginning, and what that holds in store remains to be seen. But as a child he was very very good. Maybe the best ever.

433,Hypotheses,"A Flawed Masterpiece, But Great All the Same",9,8 July 2001,"*****A FEW SPOILERS*******Clearly a Masterpiece Until Spielberg Stepped in at the End, But Works All the SameBy the first 20 minutes, I was mesmerized and enthralled by A.I. or `Artificial Intelligence'. And my interests continued all the way through despite the Spielbergian sentimentalism and heavy-handedness.While no one can deny that both Kubrick and Spielberg are supreme masters at their craft, the two are inherently at opposite ends of the artistic spectrum; thus the overall consistency of purpose and vision of A.I. is somewhat mixed. Nevertheless, the end result is still one of the most spellbinding and innovative movies of the summer.The main problem: Spielberg's undying need to inject emotionalism and optimism at the end, killed the relentless, cold logic of a distinctly Kubrickian first act. (Hey, `2001: A Space Odyssey' is one of the greatest films of all time in my mind.) A similar problem is that A.I. isn't one film, but a gigantic sprawling film of at least three to four highly charged issues that were only superficially explored by the film. There were also a few technical and scientific fluffs (Physics 101 mistakes), but I won't get into that here.The Ben Kingsley narration, the roaring dog-like motorcycles, the blue fairy stuff, shafts of light, menacing men of authority in silhouette, and other small things are clearly Spielberg. It seemed as though, Spielberg reached into the vault of the past and tried to combine elements of E.T., Close Encounters (third act), and the fairy tale quotient of Hook with some clearly Blade Runner-ish stuff by Kubrick all in an effort to call off questions about A.I. being his film in the final analysis. Still, the film has a lot going for it. The haunting modern score of Williams is on target; the casting of Frances O'Connor as the mother, Jude Law as the gigolo mecha, and Hurt as the paternal god-complex scientist was without question flawless; and the production values were top-notch as well as the special effects of course (this being a Spielberg film).Clearly, A.I. was a labor of love for both directors. Stanley Kubrick is many a director's director and it is well known that Kubrick is one of Spielberg's favorites, yet Spielberg couldn't help but be Spielberg and completely take A.I. in a zany direction that Kubrick most certainly would not have. For example, David could have somehow self-destructed or de-activated, once he painfully realized that he was not unique, but a mere commodity, an automaton that would never have been accepted by Monica, or most humans for that matter. The point at which he falls off the building would have been perfect for wrapping up the story. Instead, the film CONTINUED with more blue fairy stuff, which wasn't all that bad in of itself, just totally incongruous with the preceding story.Even so, A.I. is still a wonderful serio-fantasy. I highly recommend it to any Kubrick, Blade Runner, or hard-core sci-fi/fantasy fan.

434,Hypotheses,"A Flawed Ambitious Piece, But Great All the Same",9,9 July 2001,"*******WARNING SOME SPOILERS**********By the first 20 minutes, I was mesmerized and enthralled by A.I. or ""Artificial Intelligence"". And my interests continued all the way through despite the Spielbergian sentimentalism and heavy-handedness.
While no one can deny that both Kubrick and Spielberg are supreme masters at their craft, the two are inherently at opposite ends of the artistic spectrum; thus the overall consistency of purpose and vision of A.I. is somewhat mixed. Nevertheless, the end result is still one of the most spellbinding and innovative movies of the summer.The main problem: Spielberg's undying need to inject emotionalism and optimism at the end, killed the relentless, cold logic of a distinctly Kubrickian first act. (Hey, ""2001: A Space Odyssey"" is one of the greatest films of all time in my mind.) A similar problem is that A.I. isn't one film, but a gigantic sprawling film of at least three to four highly charged issues that were only superficially explored by the film. There were also a few technical and scientific fluffs (Physics 101 mistakes), but I won't get into that here.The Ben Kingsley narration, the roaring dog-like motorcycles, the blue fairy stuff, shafts of light, menacing men of authority in silhouette, and other small things are clearly Spielberg. It seemed as though, Spielberg reached into the vault of the past and tried to combine elements of E.T., Close Encounters (third act), and the fairy tale quotient of Hook with some clearly Blade Runner-ish stuff by Kubrick all in an effort to call off questions about A.I. being his film in the final analysis. Still, the film has a lot going for it. The haunting modern score of Williams is on target; the casting of Frances O'Connor as the mother, Osment as the ""boy"" (Osment was so good that it was scary), Jude Law as the giggolo mecha, and Hurt as the paternal god-complexed scientist was without question flawless; and the production values were top-notch as well as the special effects, of course (this being a Spielberg film).Clearly, A.I. was a labor of love for both directors. Stanley Kubrick is many a director's director and it is well known that Kubrick is one of Spielberg's favorites, yet Spielberg couldn't help but be Spielberg and completely take A.I. in a zany direction that Kubrick most certainly would not have. For example, David could have somehow self-destructed or de-activated, once he painfully realized that he was not unique, but a mere commodity, an automaton that would never have been accepted by Monica, or most humans for that matter. The point at which he falls off the building would have been perfect for wrapping up the story. Instead, the film CONTINUED with more blue fairy stuff, which wasn't all that bad in of itself, just totally incongruous with the preceding story.
Even so, A.I. is still a wonderful serio-fantasy. I highly recommend it to any Kubrick, Blade Runner, or hard-core sci-fi/fantasy fan. I promise that you will not be disappointed with A.I.'s parts and that you will certainly have a lot to discuss.And if you don't mind me, I think that I'll go see it again next week.

435,TheDuke-2,Spielberg pays homage to Kubrick,8,11 July 2001,"Steven Spielberg, perhaps the best director of our generation since Hitchcock finishes a movie that Mr. Kubrick started before he died recently. This movie is different and ""out there"" but this is why it deserves attention.  Kubrick never when with the masses on any of his movies, and this movie is no different.  Spielberg took the foundations of AI and ran with them.  He added a few of his spins to it and put together a decent film.  This is a movie that needs to be seen and judged for itself.  I would not recommend this movie to the ""non immaginative"" person.  It does have a small amount of flaws, which is why I personally gave it an 8.",A.I. Artificial Intelligence
436,snakejenkins,Spielberg's Flawed Masterpiece,8,1 July 2002,"A.I. from Steven Spielberg is an interesting union between two of the greatest (or ""so-called"" greatest) film-makers of our time. Stanley Kubrick conceived of the film and Steven Spielberg actually made it after Kubrick's death. Many people have said that there are obvious signs of Kubrick's hand on the film and perhaps they are right. Being that I am not, nor have ever been, a Kubrick enthusiast I am not the person to talk to about this. I am more qualified to look at Spielbergs work as a director and comment on it. A.I. is the story of a robot who was built to love. Haley Joel Osment proves once again that he is a prodigy of an actor. His portrayal of the robot, David, is so layered and just plain good that one truly watches in awe at his abilities. Jude Law is also good in his small role of Gigolo Joe. I could go on for a while about the acting but, suffice to say, the acting was never a problem. Neither is the overall directing of the film. Spielber's shot composition gets more and more interesting with every film he makes. There is one shot in particular where David is staring at his mother over a metal table and we see his reflection staring back at him that is quite amazing. At no point in the film did I ever have problems with the mechanics of film-making. The actual conception of the film and many of its written elements... that is another story. The story of A.I. begins as a moralistic fable and a cautionary one. The dangers and lunacy of giving something the ability to love without thinking of the consequences, the irresponsibility of parents, the inability of humans to relate to anything at all that is not exactly like they are. These are all statements that begin to take shape throughout the film and, had the film continued on this particular journey, could have solidified itself as, possibly, the greatest motion picture in history. But after David is abandoned the film starts to fall apart. We see Spielberg having to rely on visual effects and sci-fi cliches because the story is simply not built strongly enough to carry through the moral fibers of the initial plot. We see the Mechas acting in ways that is not quite accurate of beings unable to love or feel. We see a great mystery which could have been the central arc to the film solved in under 10 minutes of screen time. And, lastly (and mostly tragically) we see the climax dissect itself into a confusion of emotions that eventually lead the viewer to feel just tired and cranky. I didn't mind the idea that David would be the last link to the past, I didn't mind the idea of the Uber-Mechas searching for their own past (in fact I rejoiced it), what I did in fact mind was the way that the film tried to wrap itself up made little sense. Not that I don't enjoy a head scratcher, which this wasn't, but I do like a story to make sense within its own universe. What Spielberg tried to do was amazing. What we got was something less than what it could have been... SHOULD have been. It left me sad not because I felt for the characters, but rather because I saw what it might have been.",A.I.

Monica I liked.And something else that should go in the Trivia section. I don't know if anyone else noticed.

440,Ell-4,"Somewhat Disappointed, but did not want to be.",6,29 June 2001,"I wanted so much to love this movie as I think Steven Spielberg is one of the finest directors in America today. However, though the film held my interest,in reality, it was somewhat of a disappointment. I'm wondering if Spielberg has reached the end of the line with his previously wonderful fantasy movies. Almost every scene in A-I was reminiscent of another film. E.T. with the moon and the space ship, Poltergeist, with the severe distortion of faces and bodies, Close Encounters, with the A-I creatures in part three. Copying from other directors, The Wizard of Oz beginning of the blue fairy saga, and Teddy who resembled George Lucas, Ewoks,  in The Star Wars Trilogy.  At this point in time, Spielberg seems to be copying from himself.We will discount Pinnochio as that itself was an intricate part of A-I and meant to be part of the picture. The acting of Haley Joel Osment was unbelievably wonderful. However, Sam Robards, the father, will never meet the acting genius of his father Jason Robards or his mother Lauren Bacall. It was a role that could have been played by almost any actor. What is most interesting, is although the majority of the professional movie critics, gave it a high rating, reading between the lines, they also did some sound criticism. The Spielberg mystic holds for us all. He knows how to keep his audience and how much new stuff can he come up with in his fantasy world anyhow? Despite its shortcomings, A-I still managed to keep a spellbound audience. Somewhat ambivalent review, but what else to be said.",A.I. Artificial Intelligence

Interesting to note, though, that the thing did have an audience: some reviews positively drip with adoration. Heaven knows what sort of wide-eyed ingenue one has to be to actually like this film, and to buy into its sugar-puff mentality, but such people do, demonstrably, exist.So I'll confine myself to one observation: from whence came this weird conceit that artificial intelligences are going to have such terrible difficulty duplicating human emotions? There's nothing uniquely human or advanced about emotions - in fact they evolved a very long time ago, as a cheap replacement for thinking in very primitive organisms that didn't have the apparatus for reasoning, and had to rely on pre-programmed behaviour instead. They're just instincts, and a lot easier to duplicate than true intelligence. Pack it in, you SF authors. If you want AIs to have problems with something, try stereo vision.",A.I.

I wanted to sleep through it but I wasn't tired enough. I'm not suprised that this hasn't made back it's production costs, it just doesn't hit the mark.

Kids might like it, but I would find it difficult to believe that anyone with an eye for good movies could find anything to praise in this over-long, sentimental story of a little robot-boy (ever so cute) with the obligatory bit for a dog (here in the shape of a mechanised teddy bear that walks and talks and never runs out of power, even after 2000 years ... those were some Duracells!) who was dumped in the woods by his loving mummy and spent the next two millennia searching for Pinocchio's Blue Faery and his adopted mother. The story sucks, and this is aggravated by the dreadful music; the camera work also fails to add lustre to this duller-than-dishwater ""adventure"".

447,Patrick-96,I disliked this film!,4,9 July 2001,"I have objects all over my home.  The longer I have them, the more attached I get.  Not one to be a packrat, I occasionally force myself to get rid of the access, which in a little way, breaks my heart.  Even the most trivial of items has some kind of connection to me.  In this film, a married couple, who's only child is in a coma, acquires a life-like robot, which resembles a real 11 year old boy (designed to have human emotions to love and be loved.)  The idea of placing this robot child in the home is the father's.  His wife has been grieving and he is sure that this will mend her breaking heart.  The mother resists at first, but the child named David (played brilliantly by Haley Joel Osment) breaks down her resistance and she accepts the robot has her child.  All is well until the real child wakes up from his coma and returns home.The father completely turns on David and their real son is jealous of him. The mother eventually is persuaded to get rid of him and this is where the film falls apart for me.  No one with any kind of heart would do this.  As I said, objects have always held a sentimental value for me.  Now if I had a robot child that was a precious as David is, there is no way in the world I would discard him.  Not only that, but the way she discards him is outrageous!The film drags on and introduces us to a lot of characters that we don't care about and don't advance the storyline.  Even the fabulous Jude Law is wasted in a role that never connects emotionally with David.
Finally, the film comes to a conclusion.  Then you find out it isn't a conclusion, the film runs for another 20 minutes and then the `typical Spielberg ending' occurs.  But by this time, I was numb.  I couldn't feel anymore.I believe Haley Joel Osment is the most talented performer of his generation and should be awarded an Academy Award for his performance in a film that I truly disliked.

They don't want to be ""bored"" with allusions to classic literature, strange new ideas, and challenging questions. But everyone has to decide for themselves what they think about a film. I suggest you see AI for yourself. If you are not a person who is into ""thinking"" films, or ""strange"" films, I suggest you skip the last half hour (it's the only thing I don't really like about the film).Still, some things are inexcusable. I cannot understand, for the life of me, how any reviewer could say Osment gave a bad performance. BAD? It was spectacular! He never blinks, he acts like a robot, but he also acts like a kid. He moves me to tears several times, and that is not easy at all. The rest of the cast, likewise, put up great performances.This is an epic film, a parallel of Pinochio (sp?), an a brave statement about the human condition and the possibilities of the future (good and bad).

It's accused of being overly sentimental but I thought it was effective in portraying the relationship between a mother and a young child, and the search for meaning and reality in our lives. The shifts in tone and setting between the three acts was jarring to many people but this was completely intentional and set a unique style to proceedings. Needless to say it was visually stunning with great performances, although Rouge City was strangely sterile and unerotic.ENDING: But the purpose of MY review is to point out the meaning of the ending for the many who didn't get it. The creatures at the end were NOT aliens, but highly evolved robots/mechas. Evidence for this:-Gigolo Joe mentions one day humanity will be extinct and all that will be left are mechas -The mechs talk about David, and others like him, being their ancestors, (if they were aliens why would a robot be their ancestor?). -The future mechs talk about humanity being the key to existence and life. Why would aliens think humanity are the basis of life and existence?Of course the DVD features confirm the beings are robots not aliens but to my mind this was explained in the film, it wasn't hard to figure it out, yet AI has been criticised in many reviews because of the supposedly bizarre ET ending which makes perfect sense if people PAID ATTENTION and THOUGHT about what they were viewing.OK rant over, greetings to all those who played the AI puzzle trail on the net.",A.I.

453,baz_trinity,"Why Spielberg, why?",7,11 November 2006,"I'll say this with a sigh and I don't want to say this, but I was really disappointed with this movie. But let me explain how this film got a high and an above average 7 out of ten.This is what I felt for the first say, 1hour 45 minutes. I felt this movie was one of the most thrilling, exciting, sad, brilliant movies of the decade. And I don't throw compliments like that around often. Hayley Joel Osmont played a stunning, captivating role that is Oscar worthy and Jude Law did a mighty fine job also. In fact, the acting all round was quite impressive. Visually, well, it was flawless. The directing, the lighting, the special effects, the robots, all perfect, the music was moving and atmospheric and intertwined with the movies disturbing and oddball theme and it never failed to offer heart-wrenching moments and tense, unnerving scenes. The movie went along at a fast enough pace, jumping quickly from one section to another perfectly and hit all the right emotions that made you actually feel for the robots. Very symbolic in places, especially the FLESH FAIR which was a direct hint towards the holocaust. The future was predicted well, quite possible in fact and it wasn't too ridiculous to be imaginable. The settings, scenery and ambiance was just advanced enough to have a futuristic tone, but restricted enough to be possible. In a nutshell, this film is pretty hard to criticize. Well, this is what I thought, until after the scene that changed everything.*spoiler warning* I remember the start of the movie had an introductory narrative, explaining the worlds conditions and such and how the story would begin. Much, much later in the movie the voice returned, whilst David is submerged under water and pleading with blue fairy statue to make him a real boy. The voice returned in a fashion that the movie would end. The voice explains how David kept pleading and how did so for over 2000 years. At this point I thought this movie was amazing and one of my favorites, the perfect ending to the movie and a really moving and exceptionally thought provoking ending to AI. But no, Spielberg had to give us more. And a really awful ending entails.In short, it shows David breaking out of the ice 2000 years later and meeting up with a group of badly designed, unimaginative aliens that would let him see his mother for one more day. At this point, all the humans have become extinct and therefore, of course, his mother has died. But somehow these aliens manage to use bits of people to recreate the humans perfectly for one more day. An over-sentimental, over-emotional and a particularly ""Disney"" scene follows, that is dragged out, embarrassing, out of context with the rest of the movie, sickeningly happy and downright awful. This movie was always disturbing and off-the-wall and this ending is just a complete contrast that just does not fit. It literally ruined a movie that had the full potential to be a classic, yet the last 15 minutes, Spielberg did a ""fairy-tale ending on it"" and ruined it. I can't explain how utterly crap it is and I actually felt angry and depressed that something as simple as a conclusion can ruin a spectacular experience. A dark ending to a dark movie was the way to go, was the way to create a masterpiece, but Stephen Spielberg obviously had his way and destroyed.I strongly urge people to watch this movie, but I also strongly suggest you stop it after the second narrative kicks in. Until then, I would've given it a perfect 10 out of ten, but nothing denies that Spielberg made a fatal mistake.What a pity.",A.I. Artificial Intelligence
454,blue__yoshi,"Brilliant ideas, lightly brushed over",4,17 September 2001,"All the ideas and themes were in place, and the emotional potential was there but Speilberg is a great film maker, not a deep thinker. So it all goes to waste. A slow start followed by an engaging 40 minutes then it's all downhill (a seemingly long time) to the end. Great concepts and ideas are presented and then dealt with a superfical, I would even say shallow, way by Speilberg. Perhaps being so brilliantly talented and successful has left him too sheltered in his life and unable to draw on the emotion really needed to pull this off. 
As for the cast Haley-Joel does okay, Jude excellent but Teddy steals every scene. Teddy represents everything that is good about Speilberg  while the light dusting over the moral issues and one-sided presentation of good and evil is all that is bad about Speilberg. Possible SPOILERSThe movie can be quite jarring in it's scene transitions but I viewed this as a good thing and it helped hold my interest when it was beginning to wander. But the sudden appearance of the arena scene with cheesy motorbikes complete with dog heads really took me out of the movie. A lot of this scene seems incomplete, out of place or too in-your-face, often all at the same time! I guess in this respect he did some justice to Kubrik's style. The not too subtle American imagery (stars and stripes everywhere), the south style accents, the ridiculous arena set-up looking more 'Running Man' or 'Escape from New York' than something conceptulized in 2001.As for the ending - I never used to believe people who would say a voice over is a lazy or convenient way to explain exposition and move a story forward because I'd seen so many good uses of it. But this film proved that it can be a very misused device.Although I doubt it's true, it really felt at times Speilberg was on autopilot, ripping bits from his other films. The opening scene felt so much like the obvious exposition it was and reminded me of Sam Neil at the dig in Jurassic Park (complete with over-acting extras in the background), other parts were remeniscent of Close Encounters, Empire of the Sun, and especially E.T.To me this is one of Spielbergs worst to date. A brilliant idea in the hands of a brilliant director but I feel Spielberg's view of the world and the nuclear family just aren't just aren't those of the common person.

I'm sure it is somewhat different from what Kubrick had thought but he and Spielberg had worked on it for a long time. I liked the questions that it posed about such as what does it mean to be a being?  Does the boy robot have genuine feelings or are they programmed?  But we as people do we have genuine feelings or are they ""programmed"" in our genetic code, by society, and by other factors?  Intriguing questions from an intriguing film. Definitely a thinking persons movie. The acting by Haley Joel Osmet was outstanding and the supporting cast was equally good, too.  The portrayal of the future was somewhat frightening but also extremely fascinating. Especially the ending of the film.  I saw this film with my brother who's first word when the film ended was ""Wow!""  He only expresses that for films he really likes.

I've heard it's getting very mixed reviews and I can see why. There's a lot of great stuff in this film, both visually (very Blade Runner-esque) and with the story (not original, but interesting enough). Steven Spielberg, however, manages to ruin it all by the end of this meandering, contrived, REPETITIVE and ultimately boring 2 1/2 hour fiasco. In fact, about 2/3 of the way through the movie, almost everyone in the theater was shifting and fidgeting (myself included), which is a pretty good indication you've lost your audience. Through the first hour, it's an interesting story that really seems like it's going to go somewhere. But it goes way downhill from there and then keeps digging. The entire character base changes, thin sub-plots emerge and loose ends get left all over the place. And probably my biggest complaint: almost every scene is way too long! The pace of the film is unbelievably slow. What this film needs is some major re-editing. If cut right, it could be good. I mean there's certainly potential there--good acting, many great individual scenes and lots of emotional set-up. As is, though, it's a runaway train that takes too freakin' long to finally wreck. ...And once the aliens show up (oh yes, there are aliens!), you know they're grasping for how the heck to end this thing.

Spielberg had his proverbial head up his behind when he green-lighted this project. I found it very difficult to sit through in the theater where I saw it on a very large screen with a very mixed audience opening day. Before the film ended, people were walking out. It's a very uncomfortable film to sit through, despite the pretty special effects and Jude Law making an ass out of himself. If you enjoy seeing children threatened, harassed, discarded, tortured, abused, and misunderstood in a hundred ways, then you'll enjoy watching this film. Why would anyone spend hundreds of millions of dollars inventing a robot to 'love' you? How could any government condone creating a land for people to have sex with robots? Why would anyone regard destroying (in a malicious way) robots that resemble real people as mass entertainment? Spielberg's premises are stretched too thin on a convoluted plot that is both absurd, silly, and downright repulsive. If you wish to see Spielberg as an artist and director extraordinaire, watch and enjoy Jaws, CETK, ET, Schindler's List, Jurassic Park, or even Raiders of the Lost Arc... anything but this film (or 1941).",A.I.

I suppose one could say that the movie is well-made in all these categories.  However, my review is about the message in the movie and how it makes you feel afterwards.  It makes you feel like your life means nothing.  It makes you feel depressed and sad.  IT SUCKS THE LIFE OUT OF YOU AND THROWS IT IN A GARBAGE CAN.  When I got out the theater, I thought to myself, okay why am I living, I'm going to die anyways, life sucks, we're here to die.  And that wasn't only my opinion, but also the friend who I saw it with.  What's the point of a movie if it makes you feel bad at the end.  It's not as if each movie has to end with a happy ending, however, there must be a limit.  I don't see the message of the movie, it's not as if they are teaching us something.

I probably won't see it again.  The film  certainly akes you think, and there are some very cool images and special effects on display. For the most part, I cannot say that I enjoyed the film.  It tried to be too many things, and you can get a glimpse how each one of those things could've been a great movie/story, but there simply wasn't enough time to do a good job on any of them.  It could've been a nice fairy tale.  It could've been a good action/sci-fi thriller.  It could've been a wonderful social commentary.  It was all of these without the complimentary adjective. 
The good thing is that it is a movie that you will discuss afterward, but the watching of the movie was not a glorious, magical experience that you might be looking for.  Haley Joel Osment was good in the movie.  Possibly his greatest acheivement is keeping you always conscious that he isn't real, but this is what makes it harder to root for him, and which, for me, anyway, makes it harder to ""lose myself"" in the movie.  You watch and analyze this movie, you don't participate.  It's hard to enjoy a movie where you don't really care about (or even know whether you are supposed to care about) it's characters.One more thing.  The movie is not meant for very young viewers.

I think he is a great filmmaker with a bad case of the maudlin.  I was prepared to really like this movie. I hated it. This movie is a disaster. Bad storytelling. Bad story. The first half hour is basically mindnumbing exposition of scifi mumbo jumbo. It bored me to tears. Compare to 2001: no exposition, no speeches, nothing but astonishing iconic classic genius visuals. How people dare to put Kubrick and Spielberg in the same breath is beyond me. Next HJO shows up. He is a very professional actor but he leaves me cold. Not very likable. Very technical. I can't get worked up over his predicament because he is a robot, so why should I give a damn. The only person that shows a spark of life in this movie is Jude Law. The movie wakes up when he is in the frame. I liked Teddy too, I hope they market one in K-Mart so I can buy it. AI is not an intelligent film. It's a film for nerds that love big scifi words. Scores very low in the emotional intelligence scale which means in the maturity, logical, common sensical scale. It has a number of stunning visuals. Robot in the pool.

When I finally saw AI, I saw far too many of Spielberg's trademarks; an annoying offspring (Martin), a dysfunctional Caucasian family, fun music during the action scenes, mommies, and so on.It took 6 years and about 5 viewings for me to finally 'get it', to see through the Spielbergyness, and to just watch it without picking it apart or wishing Kubrick had directed it. This isn't a movie about mommies and sons. Its not really much of a fairy tale. Artificial Intelligence is a brilliant and complex film about human irresponsibility.",A.I. Artificial Intelligence
465,Fiona G.,At least cut the last 30 minutes,4,10 April 2002,"What a neat premise this movie came up with at the beginning: show us what turns life can take if a machine becomes truly intelligent and able to bear emotions. But then the movie almost immediately starts to stomp on its own feet. Our hero, David, the first of the new robot generation able to handle emotions, is apparently not the first. Otherwise his predecessors would not be able to fear death, develop cynism beyond their limited programming or forget their programming at all. Best example here the lovebot ""Gigolo Joe,"" who tries to go undercover when he finds a dead woman in his apartment and later befriends David - all this goes far beyond ""programmed reactions"" as explained in the movie (why would the manufacturer program these into a lovebot at all?). Oh, and if you wonder how much thicker the plotline became due to ""Gigolo Joe"" imagine his role being deleted and try to think hard if he delivered anything useful.  (Ok, I will *not* argue about the question why David gets shortfused when he eats spinach but can fall into a pool and nothing happens or why with all the elaborate technology to mimic humans none of the bots blink.)Then we see David getting left by his mother (or the person he was programmed to love) and his endless quest to find the ""Blue Fairy"" from ""Pinocchio"" who he thinks can make him a real boy and win him the love of his mother. Did I say endless? Yes, because all of us past age 8 know that this quest will be futile. You may feel sorry for David, but you will also feel like watching an accident happen and you can do nothing about it.
But then enter Mr. Spielberg. When you watch the last 30 minutes of the movie you will know what I mean. You can almost tell where Kubrick's notes ended for sure and where Spielberg took what he described as ""his own intellectual freedom."" At this point you will feel like watching ""E.T."" and ""2001"" at the same time - on an LSD trip. Spielberg tried so hard to reach the heights of Kubrick (and had Williams throw in some ""2001""-like tunes for the final) it is almost pitiful how he ruins his own ambitions with his pink popcorn attitude to sooth the viewer. Spielberg just can't let us go without a pat on the shoulder and a reassuring ""everything will be fine!""How swell would everything have been, if the movie ended right there with David staring and begging and Teddy eternally sitting with him. Audiences would have left the theaters wondering ""are we aware of what a responsibility we are getting ourselves into there?"" I would have even forgotten about the above mentioned implausibility of the emotional reactions the earlier robots had, which most likely were delivered to pull us onto the sides of the robots.

He looks and sometimes acts like a real child on the out side, but his program is so primitive you never feel that it's love he is feeling or care about him above the fact that he is just machine.  When dose this movie take place?  We are on the verge now of having machines that can do more than this glorifide Furby can do.  Why would he or we care about a mother that abandoned him.  All that says to parents is, if you can't handle a problem child forget counsoling, just abandoned them.  They say movies are bad infuences for kids.

Kubrick handing it over to Spielberg may have been the perfect choice, as this movie has elicited much the same views as Kubrick's own great SF masterpiece, 2001: A Space Odyssey.  Essentially, this is a love-it-or-hate-it movie that is dark, dreary, yet filled with a hope that subtly pervades the entire film.  But it IS science fiction in the true sense of the word, even if it is based on another literary work (Pinochio). For those that think it is too slow moving, I dare you to go back and watch Soylent Green again and notice the very glacial pacing of that movie which is considered one of the great SF films, or at the original Planet of the Apes.  By today's standards, these are almost motionless pictures, but it is the time that is spent developing the whole plot and sub-plot and counter-plot and sub-counter-plot that makes an intricate film like this work.  This is not a film where you sit down and turn off your brain for 2 hours, it is designed to elicit thought and emotion, and whether you love this film or hate it, if you have one of these two reactions, then it has done exactly what it was intended to do.  That is the core of SF, and that is the core of this film.  On the pywrit scale of 1-10, I give it a solid 8.5.",A.I. Artificial Intelligence

Alas, I merely kept falling asleep!  What a tragic waste of celluloid considering the amazing talents at work here in William Hurt, Haley Joel Osment and the wizardry of ILM.  It is far too long and convoluted...and appears that Spielberg couldn't decide whether he wanted to tell a schmaltzy love story or deliver a neo-political message about the potential dark future of humanity.  I called this one ""Pinnochio meets the Terminator"" and it ended up making neither story line very exciting.There are some definite magical moments and well delivered emotional sequences, and the cinematography--particularly in the latter part of the movie (i.e. underwater Manhattan, Rouge City)--is incredible.  But we still find ourselves yawning through most of the filler that makes this epic almost 2.5 hours long.  Spielberg should have made this a ""made-for-TV"" special (which would have made it about 85 minutes long allowing for commercial breaks) and then he could have left in all the great parts without the multitude of boring, go-nowhere scenes that attempted to show humanity's attitude toward thinking machines.If you were a big fan of Teddy Ruxpin, rent this movie just to see the super version of him in the future.  Sadly, the main character's sidekick in this movie (just called ""Teddy"") was probably the character with the best script and received the most human empathy despite being made of steel, wires & fake fur.

The visuals are striking - much of what was on-screen was futuristic and familiar all at once.  The story is compelling, because it boils down to something everyone can understand: a quest for personal identity rising out of a desire to be loved.  The performances are spectacular - I don't know if anyone has ever had two Oscar nominations by the age of 13, but Haley Joel Osment could certainly achieve such a feat.The Kubrickian qualities of the movie will make it stand out among Steven Spielberg's filmography, no doubt.

The beginning parts with the family and Haley Jo Osmet as the Robot child David are fantastic. From the scence where he creepily follows her around the apartment to him watching them eat dinner as he mocks their movements with a fork and a bowl. The problem with this type of robot is it is programmed to love unconditioally and the love is programmed so strongly that if the parent has to give the child back the best thing to do is to take it to the factory for its destruction. Trouble begins when the real son is cured and comes home and breeds nothing but contempt for David, to the son David is a little toy to messed with.

This half works as well if not better then the first half, and then it all goes to hell. The last half hour of this movie is atrocious, it was a waste of time and I so steamed they felt it needed to be in the film. I won't give away anything but the movie could have ended with a much tougher and more haunting ending then it did, because after the Kubrik half is over we get a final Spielbergian half hour.

In most cases when a question of this magnitude comes along, the filmmakers will opt to come at the question from an angle, or mask the complexities of the question with slapstick antics so that the question itself becomes obfuscated within the ever growing so-called plot (consider such films as ""Short Circuit"" and ""Electric Dreams"").A.I. does not come at these (and many other) questions from an angle: it confronts them head-on.A.I. does not mask the fact that it is delving into such philosophical territory with silly antics and slapstick comedy: it looks the questions in the eye and demands an answer that it knows cannot come in any objective form. In other words, this is not a shy film. It is bold and a real achievement in movie-making and story-telling. I have to say that I really enjoyed the film -- not only as a medium of entertainment, but as a springboard of some very satisfying debate and conversation with my friends and family. But we all agree on one thing: the film ended about 5-10 minutes too late.The final sequences of David's life were counterproductive to the messages and feel of the film.

To me it would have been much more interesting to have people rebel against the humans who have found love with machines. That at least would bring more of a moral dilemma to the film which is sadly missing. I never thought the Monica character ever bonded fully with David, the machine/son and so I never really cared about their relationship. The Gigolo Joe character, played by Jude Law was interesting, but was never really fully explored. I think that Spielberg is the greatest filmmaker of all time, so I personally have to hold him to a higher standard here.

It makes me jealous that he can act with such great skill!! Kudos to the young lad! The dark mood of the movie, the music score and even the SFX were marvelous... A touching movie for me...I was trying to hold back the tears at the end..Watch it and realize that we aren't as ""human"" as we are made out to be!",A.I. Artificial Intelligence
486,pmoney13,"a very good movie, but...",7,29 June 2001,"a dumb ending nearly ruins what could have been an epic sci-fi masterpiece. I won't give anything away, but I will say that there is a point where the movie should end, but doesn't, and instead goes on for almost another (unnecessary) half hour. Despite this, the new Spielberg film is a story well told, sort of a futuristic (and demented) Pinochio. The first half of the movie may turn some viewers off because of its leisurely pacing, detailing the young android's integration into a family that has just suffered a tragedy with their son. The second half is clearly the movie's strong suit, what with its astounding visuals and special effects. The production design (which includes the burlesque neon nightmare Rouge City, and New York submerged) is incredible, maybe the most impressive since we witnessed smog infested L.A. in Blade Runner. The performances are memorable, also. Osment is great as the young child android who yearns to be real, and Jude Law is sensational as Joe, the ""love mecha"", but it's the little ""supertoy"" Teddy who steals the show.Anyone thinking that this film is a schmaltzy Spielbergian kids flick is sadly mistaken. This film is definitely not for kids. It can be endearing at times, but also very creepy and possibly unnerving. Scenes in which androids are ripped apart for game are genuinely disturbing.All in all, Spielberg has created a memorable flick, although not of the caliber of, say, Jaws. Anyone sick of the usual tiresome summer fare like Mummy Returns and Tomb Raider should see this. It offers something with actual imagination and substance, something lacking in many recent films.",A.I. Artificial Intelligence
487,o_lopez,masterpiece,10,14 December 2001,"I think A.I. is one of the best films of 2001. Spielberg stays true to Kubrick's style.

488,filmquestint,Artificial indeed,3,15 January 2005,"Strange, ""ET"" made me weep so did ""Close Encounters"" but I didn't weep in ""Schindler's List"", where the horrors depicted are devastating and the pain, unbearable. How can I explain that? It's not just me, discussing the subject with friends we were all in agreement, a situation more unique than rare, the only in disagreement was a friend from Aberdeen, she cried in ""Schindler's List"" from beginning to end, but she doesn't count, she also cried in ""Zoolander"". So the mystery persists. Steven Spielberg, the most commercially successful movie director of the last 30 years, has touched and ventured into different genres with the uttermost confidence. His most artistically, emotionally and financially successful movies are the ones that appeal to a child's imagination. The child in all of us. So, why is it that ""Artificial Intelligence"", with a child, and what a child, at the centre of the story, is so cold, so confused, so unsuccessful. I think, I suspect, I imagine that it has to do with intellect. Spielberg is an anti intellectual. When he feels we feel when he thinks we don't feel anything. The boy's need for his mother's love could have been the definitive Spielberg movie. Instead, is as if he was telling us the story against his will. The scene in which the mother has to abandon his robot son, could have been unforgettable, instead, a lot of acting in a Disney like little forest. That's also the end of the movie. It is followed by a second feature that should be called ""Mad Max meets Dr.Who"" with a splendid Jude Law. I went to see the film at the first matinée on its opening day. I left the theatre kind of depressed, not sad, depressed. I was reminded of it today because my friend from Aberdeen had rented the DVD, she was watching it and of course, she was crying.",A.I.

I wanted to kick a homeless man in the neck. That's how bad this movie was.Basically, AI played out as if the script were written as a group project by a first-year film school class. It was like a long, tedious, confusing movie with a shorter, confusing, tedious movie tacked onto the end of it. Incoherent is the best word to describe this movie; it's a bewildering mish-mash of styles and themes that is ultimately without direction or purpose. Not surprisingly, it was not without its fair share of cheesy, manipulative emotional scenes - all the more awkward because the plot was so ridiculous. Imagine you're over 2 hours into a movie and then the narration starts. ""And so, he sat there for a time. And then he kept sitting there..."" This is the point you begin trying to jam a soda straw through your eyeball. Unfortunately, the movie does have some promising beginnings; the first half hour or so are quite intriguing, and play out as a reasonable sensible drama. After that, though, the movie leaves the road and goes off into the weeds and you can kiss a few precious hours of your life goodbye. By the time you realize it's time to escape, it's basically too late.Good performance by Osment; painful performance by Hurt, as usual; and superb work by the Teddy bear, who provided a good minute or so of relief among the other 164-odd minutes.If you liked ""Mission to Mars"", this is the movie for you.

This is, by far, Spielberg's best film. It encompasses everything you could want in a summer film, but is also has substance, something many films these days are lacking.Haley Joel Osment gives a brilliant performance. Not since Elijah Wood and Jodie Foster has a child actor carried a film so effortlessly and valiantly.This film does not focus too much on its brilliant special effects. Rather, it focuses on the moral dilemmas that we will have to face if this fictitious story does become fact one day.  The ending is a fascinating mixture of Kubrick and Spielberg's filmmaking techniques. Certain parts of the film (most notably the ending) just screamed Kubrick. Aspects of the ending were directly taken from 2001.I could go on and on, but this is a film every person need to see for him/herself. Critics will praise the film, the public will probably be confused by it, and it may just be forgotten by Oscar time. However, in years to come, it will be known as Spielberg's seminal work and he will be appreciated for bringing his friend's final vision to life.",A.I. Artificial Intelligence
491,prezike,Will A.I. be forever misunderstood?,9,2 July 2001,"A.I. will clearly be a film that evokes strong emotional reactions, either for or against it.First off, this movie...once again, like Eyes Wide Shut, was mis-marketed, all in hopes of making a lot of money, even though the classic ""summer"" audience is likely to not enjoy it that much (especially due to most people's assumption of what a Sci-Fi movie is).  Some will like it, of course, particularly the more sensitive, and aware of what kind of film it was likely going to be.It's very interesting that Kubrick and Speilberg collaborated on this project and it ends up showing, I believe, that although Kubrick is a cold, analytical film maker, he has his soft HUMAN side.Speilberg does an excellent job of mimicking Kubrick's direction style, when he chooses to, but one can also see plenty of his own influence throughout.  Some critics have said, ""this is a Speilberg film, no doubt.""  But I think they are mistaken...it was a collaboration...a project that Kubrick had started, and ASKED SPECIFICALLY for Speilberg to take over.I think this is an important aspect of Artificial Intelligence.WHY did Kubrick do such a thing?I think if one understands the PRIMARY message of the picture, one can see why he chose Speilberg to direct it.Kubrick, it appears, would have had difficulty in sending the message he wanted of this film, if he had directed it.It is not completely ""hoakie"" as many Speilberg films can be, nor is it completely ""cold"" as Kubrick's.  It had a little of both.  It was balanced. It was not always effective in what it wanted to do, but overall it worked, because it couldn't get away from being ""cheesy"" and still send its message.THIS WAS A CLASSIC SCI-FI GENRE FILM.Many people think that Sci-Fi somehow translates into a lot of cool explosions and action...(the New York Times gave a good description of this understanding as...an Old Western done up with cool special effects), but this has not usually been the case.  Oh, and don't get me wrong, the visual effects in A.I. are marvelous.  But they compliment the story, rather than dominate it.  This Kubrick understood when shooting 2001, Cameron with Alien and the Terminator (and tried with the Abyss), and now Speilberg with A.I. (as well as other films, i.e. the Star Trek series).This is something that over time will probably be appreciated more.  It is both a fairy tale, and an examination of human beings and their attributes.The end sequence, which has been much criticized, although seemed a bit forced at times, was a prime example of this, and fits within the context of the films' message.Once you think about that, I think it is easier to digest.  People looking for a fast paced story, sorry, you aren't going to get what you were looking for.  I wonder if this was really a children's story, (as some have labeled it) or a fairy tale for adults.  Most young kids are not going to understand it, and older kids, looking for the next Star Wars are probably going to get the wrong impression due to the movie's marketing campaign.  And, of course, hardcore cynics will probably say how horrified they were with the effort...but REALLY...why is that so?",A.I. Artificial Intelligence

This film is nothing short of awe-inspiring and brilliant. It is not a perfect film but it's audaciousness and vision makes up for the fact that we never quite seem to see various subplots come to satisfying fruition. Characters are introduced that we are made to care about and then just disappear from the story altogether. Ultimately, everything makes sense.Most importantly, the core truth of the tale (the Pinocchio story) remains and how the director ultimately pulled off that feat was just so impressive. I was literally in tears, matching Haley Joel Osment, streak for streak.Exquisite and provocative, this film is a must for those who truly love the craft of film, especially films that encourage a break from the traditional story-telling mode.I can't wait to see it again and the double DVD is just an embarrassment of riches.",A.I.

Thematically very deep about the existential question, whether or not robots can have their own consciousness and an equal right to exist. The Pinocchio story is told from a robot boy's point of view, with whom we have an empathetic bond, despite his unhuman unconditional love for his mother. While this is his absolute drive, it is at the same time heartwarming and heartbreaking, as we are shown that humans can never give him back that amout of love.

It is neither a clever modernization of Pinocchio, nor a fresh version of the movie Blade Runner. The Wizard of Oz it is not.It could have been a wonderful essay on marital & parental love, or the tragedy of losing a child, or being unable to have more children. But it degenerates immediately into a neurotic & pathetic obsession of the mother with her being loved, and her selfish desire is so desperate, a soulless animitron of outward perfection will do.It could have been a searing analysis by a self-aware artificial sapient that: Man is man, and can never be duplicated, not even by man. It could have affirmed the majesty of humanity by confronting us with the revelation that the aspiration to be human is insufficient to consummate that transformation.But it ends as a protracted and ridiculous quest for an impotent fairy. It is a Close Encounter of the Meaningless Kind. At least the sham Wizard of Oz could see that the journey was half the battle.The soul of this movie is as artificial as David's is absent. David's efforts begin hopelessly, and end hopelessly. And so does this movie.Not since Random Hearts or The Pledge or Million Dollar Hotel have I seen so useless a movie. If not for Haley Joel Osment's endearing performance, this movie should been permanently consigned to deep freeze storage, just like the cruel & fiendish, but all too real, Martin.

It's about being patronized with sentimental hopefulness only as a cynical diversion to secure oblivious docile submission to the overwhelming ennui of oblivion. It's about the bleakness of mortality, and having one's deepest dreams clinically disected like an antiquated relic by supposedly superior usurpers. It's about volitional consciousness' continual unrequited quest to quench curiosity of its origin in order to clinch the incalculable cure to its own catastrophic culmination.That's not a ""neatly tied bow"" at all, its an impossible knot made in the middle of the frailest of fabric - feebly holding together a paltry facade of a secure present in the form of presence. A morbid melancholic masterpiece.Spielberg made it more subversive by being Spielberg. Which is exactly why Kubrick had wooed Spielberg to direct it instead of himself. Because Kubrick wanted to sell the condescension of existential coddle without showing his hand. If subversion comes with an assuring wink, then it's a move of insecure cowardous that betrays its insidious spell. The thing that really puts it over the top is John Williams' music score baiting the audience into a false sense of cozniness. That sappy commercial gloss done in ostentatious earnestness is essential to its dark fairy tale brilliance.The fact that in their glib superficiality, many flippant people think that Spielberg tacked on a ""hopeful"" last half hour is precisely what would make Stanley the most proud, because that's when the movie actually shifts into pure Kubrickian cynical nihilism.The real meaning of the abbreviation ""A.I."" is ""Annihilation Inevitable"" !",A.I.

497,chains01,A.I. Artificial Intelligence,8,14 May 2010,"In a futuristic world where humans and robots coexist in a shaky relationship, a robot named David (Haley Joel Osment) is taught to love and is given to a family. Being the first of his kind he is sorely misunderstood and a series of unfortunate events leads to David being on the run. All David wants is to be a real boy, though, and be loved by his mommy Monica (Frances O'Conner). So with his new found friend, Love Bot Gigolo Joe (Jude Law), David travels out to find the Blue Fairy of Pinochio fame to make him a real boy so his mother will love him.AI was originally the brain child of legendary filmmaker Stanley Kubrick, but as he was working on it he felt that the sensibilities of the film better suited a filmmaker such as Steven Spielberg. Stanley Kubrick approached Spielberg with the idea that Kubrick would produce the film, and Spielberg would direct. Of course, Spielberg was excited at the chance, but also reticent at the fact that this was the brainchild of the great Stanley Kubrick. They worked and worked on the project, Kubrick even had voices recorded that eventually appeared in the finished product (including those recorded by Chris Rock, Robin Williams, Meryl Streep, Ben Kingsley, and even Jack Angel who performed the voice of Teddy) until Kubrick had much of the concept art and even the complete treatment. Eventually Spielberg pushed back and asked Kubrick to direct and he would produce, and Kubrick relented but was unable to film the movie prior to his death in March of '99. Out of respect for his friend for the project he was originally asked to do, Spielberg picked up the work on AI and finished the film that Kubrick spent more than 12 years visualizing.AI is a flawed masterpiece. Combining the strengths of two very different filmmakers is definitely the way to create an interesting work, and bringing out the sentimentality of Spielberg and the cynicism of Kubrick makes for great interplay and a certain tension between the two different sensibilities. On the one side you have the power and endurance of love, and on the other side you have the moral dilemma of man playing god and than dehumanizing it's creation. When juggling these two images of modern society Spielberg is at his best, and most of the movie is as good, if not better than anything else the director has ever committed to film.The acting in this film is superb. Most of the movie revolves around Haley Joel Osment who was in his prime at the time (an unfortunate thing to say for a talent so young at the time and so good), and does he shine. Playing the first of his kind to feel love (or is it obsession) you truly feel for a robots plight, one of the few movies to actually grab you in that way. As his companion through most of his plight, you can tell Jude Law as Gigolo Joe is having a blast giving his ""Love Bot"" (read: sex toy) a bit of the smooth edge of Fred Astair. All of the performances in this movie truly shine though.The problem, and what makes this movie flawed, is Spielberg's recent obsession with overindulgence and the need to place pieces from his older movies in his newer movies where they don't belong. First off, the ending of the movie should have been cut off. I'm not typically the type of person who will hold anything against a long movie, and it's not that this movie is long, it's that the last half hour is completely unneeded and somewhat ridiculous. Some of the acting choices make the last 30 minutes really feel more like outtakes than an integral part of the film. To add to that though, and secondly, Spielberg felt the need to inject scenes that he had planned for Close Encounters of the Third Kind into the end of the movie, confusing audiences as to what's going on in the end with the alien like robots.Over all, I have to say that I did enjoy this movie, and it could have very well been a masterpiece and in ways it is, only if Spielberg hadn't followed his need to overindulge this movie wouldn't have lost steam. I do recommend it though, it's a movie that works well on multiple levels, for either just entertainment, or for further exploration into it's deeper meanings.4/5",A.I. Artificial Intelligence

I didn't dislike it, but I thought it fell short (hard to do in a movie that is too long) somehow.  I think the primary reason this wasn't a great movie is that Speilberg and Kubrick are just so different in their view of the world that they don't blend well on film.The story is doesn't flow consistently and causes it to drag on in several part making me look at my watch (bad sign usually) and there are a couple of spots where you think it's over (and that would be OK) and it's not.  While I like both directors, I wish Kubrick could have done this one solo (death does put a crink in your career), as Speilberg's underlying hope and human spirit touches detract from the story.The acting is top notch, that kid Osment is very good and O'Connor also shone (except for a couple of over-the-top moments).  The effects are fantastic and the created world is very impressive.This movie in the hands of Kubrick alone (with that acting and special effects) would probably have been a 10/10 but the mixture of director vision(and the length) detracted from the film so I gave it a 7/10",A.I.

504,MovieTrey,One of the worst movies I've ever seen,2,6 October 2001,"This movie was too long and had too much hype behind it.  Haley Joel Osment just didn't do it for me, especially after his performance with Bruce Willis in The Sixth Sense.  Osment's performance in Pay It Forward was just as bad if not worse then in this movie. It seems that every movie that Osment has done has gotten worse and worse. This movie was just a high tech version of Pinocchio.  This movie was a real disappointment. Movies as long as this need to keep your attention.  In order to keep your attention, movies such as this one need to have a simple plot as well as characters and dialogue which you can follow.  Simplicity is the key to make a film keep your attention.  In films such as Gladiator, Independence Day, and Titanic they are simple and to the point.  That's why films such as Titanic stay in the #1 spot for 15 weeks straight.  Aliens are attacking and that's it.  There's no backstory or long confusing plot.  Movies like ID4 had a lot of special effects, but not so much as to lose the audience's attention. Just like Star Wars: Episode I-The Phantom Menace, this movie had too much hype behind it.  People see commercials on TV and previews for upcoming movies and it seems to look good.  Most studios spend thousands of dollars just to promote their movie and hope to regain that money in ticket sales. However, too little hype can kill any chance a movie has at the box office. A good movie like Almost Famous was slaughtered by little hype.  People will go and see A.I. because of the hype but will be very disappointed by the outcome. To clarify, A.I. is a drama.  This movie is meant for people from ages 13 and up.  However, to every gray cloud there is a silver lining.  Jude Law is the silver lining in A.I. as well as the robotic teddy bear that Osment carries around with him.  Overall, Artificial Intelligence was too long, too boring and too confusing to keep the audience's attention.  I gave it a 3 out of 10 at most.

506,xteve,"This Theme's Been Done Before, and Done Better",5,17 July 2001,"Man this was so disappointing. Minor spoilers may follow.First off I do have to rave about Osment & Jude Law's performances, both of them were excellent. Jude Law continues to demonstrate he's one of the top actors working in film today. However, beyond those two, the rest of the characters in this movie are very shallowly drawn & crudely executed. It was interesting how the Mecha characters in the scenes right before the Flesh Fair were more realistic ""persons"" than any of the humans in this movie.The major flaw of this film is the script. Obviously it had gone through innumberable re-writes by several different writers, and the final result was a mess. Even though Gigolo Joe was my favorite character in this film (Teddy a close 2nd) he really serves no purpose at all in the story. Perhaps the film would have been better served with either Joe OR David as the main character, but not both. The film would have been much darker with Joe as the protagonist, but ultimately more satisfying. It's dark subject material, and using a child as the main character under Spielberg's direction injects a note of poignancy and forced sappiness that ultimately doesn't serve the story.The entire Rouge City sequence was a flat-out ripoff of Blade Runner . . .at one point this may have been the setting for the entire film, but as it stands now it's just a confusing stop on the neverending quest undertaken by David.The film is also about 45 minutes too long . . .the idea came to me the other day that the final sequence with the aliens is really the crux of the film -- somehow it seems that the story was constructed backwards in order to arrive at that point. It would be fascinating to see what Kubrick himself might have done with this film, but I don't think it would have been any better than Spielberg's version. One thing Kubrick might have done away with is the annoying expository narration. If a film needs that much set-up to lay the groundwork for the audience, then something is wrong.The bare fact is that the major theme of this movie, i.e. what does it mean to be human, what constitutes ""real people"" from synthetics, has already been examined more concisely and with more originality countless times in film and even in TV. Blade Runner seems to be what this film aspires to be on an intellectual level, but it can't touch that film artistically on a visual or character level.",A.I. Artificial Intelligence

From the trailers I was expecting and hoping for a exploration of how David might attempt to integrate with Robot (Mecha) society after being rejected by Human (Orga) society. I felt that the Pinocchio analogy was carried WAY too far and it would have been much more interesting if Spielberg had created a more fully-developed underground Mecha society. Perhaps David might have bonded with the Nanny robot, as was implied in the trailers.Gigolo Joe had forecast that Mechas would eventually replace Orgas and I think the film's final acts would have been much stronger if we traveled to the future in which that had happened. It was interesting to see the ice-Earth, but the aliens were not all-that-necessary. At least that part could have been shortened, with greater attention attention paid to his problems with being parts of and rejected by both societies.
The story was a bit a reminiscent of the recent OUTER LIMITS episode, FAMILY VALUES.",A.I. Artificial Intelligence

Don't get me wrong, I still felt that Kubrick's films are intelligent, but somehow I just can't get into them. An example of Stanley Kubrick's most boring so-called masterpiece would be 2001: A Space Odyssey. Thankfully, Steven Spielberg came to the rescue and gave the film, which originally started off as Kubrick's, some brains and more importantly, a heart. I felt that if it wasn't for Steven Spielberg, A.I. would be another overrated Stanley Kubrick ""classic."" I also love the way Spielberg casts his characters, and I wish I could say the same for Kubrick's casting of characters. With Spielberg's casting, you could see that the actors were perfect with the role.One thing I like about Stanley Kubrick is his vision, with the exception of the hotel's art direction in the Shining. With A.I., I was expecting a Steven Spielberg story with a Stanley Kubrick vision, and that is exactly what I got. Together, these elements go well.",A.I. Artificial Intelligence

I had been looking forward to it for about 3 or 4 months, even checking out the weird subplot on the internet, eagerly anticipating June 29.  I was so wrong.I went into the movie hoping to see something that would spawn its own culture, something like Star Wars (it did, in fact, have an Ewok).  Through the first third of the movie, I thought that may come true.  There were plenty of interesting emotional, uncomfortable, and just plain weird scenes. At points you can almost understand exactly what is going on with the family.Then something heinous happens.  The whole rest of the movie is just crap. There are only about 3 good scenes in the rest of this 2:25 waste of time. For the first 5 or 10 minutes after the first 'act' I tried unbelievably hard to suspend my disbelief.  This movie just got too silly.Don't get me wrong, I absolutely love Chris Rock (I really should have seen Pootie Tang instead, this movie was that disappointing), but he has no place as a cameo in this movie.  It's just uncalled for.  The middle scenes are just too ridiculous to watch.  In this time, we watch Jerry Springer (and the rest of the insults to humanity), but I can't imagine society deteriorating so much that people will want to sit around and watch robots be destroyed (even now, Comedy Central can't beg for an audience for that damn Battle Bots show, and those robots actually do something), especially in an arena setting.  It's just stupid.  I would have been much happier if someone had struck me dead before I had to endure any of this.The rest of the movie is spent not explaining some things, pulling ideas out of nowhere, and explaining other things too much.  The ending (epilogue?) is just ridiculous.  It was everything I could do to not burst into laughter in the middle of the theatre.  'The space-time continuum has a memory' - give me a break.  The worst thing is that all of the people around me were really interested.  They're like, 'oooh, aliens' and 'is that what aliens look like' - NO!  It's a piece of fiction,  A poor piece at that! I actually heard people walk out of the theatre saying, 'That was different.'  Of course it was.  Different from something good.I just can't believe that I wasted 2:25 of my life in this movie; I feel robbed.  I just wish that I hadn't been waiting so long for such a piece of crap.2.0/10",A.I.

It is definitely more in the line of a Spielberg sort of film than a Kubrick...but there is still a vague sense of darkness underlying it all that Kubrick perhaps would have appreciated. I listened to comments by other viewers as I was leaving the theater and have read many of the negative comments here...and have come to the conclusion that most people do not have much in the imagination department. Those who just want to be passively entertained in between oversized gulps of popcorn and chatterings with friends probably will not enjoy this movie. If you drop your cynicism and let yourself just go along for the ride, it's really a beautiful and sad movie. Yes, it is derivative of fairy tales...so what. It's meant to be. Yes, some of the dialogue is cheesy...so what. It's meant to be. Yes, the movie moves slowly...so what. It wouldn't be what it is any other way. If you're looking for the typical summer movie where cleavage, explosions and adrenaline abound, don't come looking here.

Just download a program and he/she could teach me to play piano, go for a run, drive on long trips, go do errands, etc... A friend without the humanity factor. I thought this movie was great. Maybe I'm just to human but the ending made me cry. It's a welcomed futuristic movie. Most futuristic movies dealing with A.I., the humanoids turn evil. An example is the movie West World. I've always been found of this genre. I thought the casting of the actors and actresses were fantastic. I enjoyed it, it's a movie I'd watch again. It's one that makes the viewer think, at least it do me. The moral issue started arising in my mind as the movie went along. What kind of rights would a humanoid have if they had feelings?I applaud this movie and marvel at the great effects. I thought Teddy was so cute, reminded me of Teddy Ruxpin the talking bear.

Of course it was very unfortunate that Stanley Kubrick couldn't direct it himself, but to me it was more like Spielberg and Kubrick (RIP) worked together during the process. There is pretty much of the Kubrick's style all over the story... that sensation of unlimited, unpredictable imagination which I felt when I first watched ""2001: A Space Odyssey"", or a clever portrayal of dehumanization, or maybe some nuances of three-way conflicts here and there. Neither a non-utopia envision of technology, nor a perfect (or believable) science-fiction story-telling, not even a cyberpunk-style plot... for me, a beautiful story about a restless search for real love.",A.I.

The emotional manipulation is so well-done that I forgave its calculatedness. The visuals are (it probably goes without saying) fantastic.

Hard to believe there are people actually compare it to ""2001: A Space Odyssey."" The ending of ""2001: A Space Odyssey"" is spectacular, inspiring yet complex; Kubrick intentionally left many things unexplained to provoke viewers' own interpretation and enlightenment.

Audiences, then as now, either ""get it"" or say ""what the hell was that all about?"" Think about it: audiences were thinking for ""2001"": ""What was that? A baby in a sphere? A light tunnel? An old dying dude in a bed? Monkeys? A BIG BLACK STUPID BOX???""When I watched A.I., I thought of the audience. I could totally see how people who saw 2001 would laugh at certain scenes. So with A.I. There were many people, almost the entire theater, especially near the end, who were laughing and leaving the theater early. Let me be blunt: If you didn't ""get"" 2001, you will NOT ""get"" A.I.It's different, it's emotional, it's thought-provoking, it's brilliant, it's KUBRICK. He came back to life to direct this film. Only on certain occasions could you tell Spielberg couldn't help himself and had to be Spielberg. While at other times, Spielberg was somewhere else, letting Kubrick direct.Anyone who says this film sucks obviously didn't ""get"" it. And yes, there is something to ""get"" with this film.Haley Joel Osment was AWESOME. If he isn't the best child actor on the face of the earth, I wanna meet the kid who is. Jude Law wasn't as amazing, but his character wasn't really allowed to be. But still, with what he had, Jude Law was also great.Let this be a lesson to Lucas: there ARE good child actors out there. But more importantly, there are GREAT child actors out there. You suck for what you did in Episode I, but Spielberg showed you up by making this film.Let this be a lesson to Spielberg: You don't have to explain EVERYTHING to the audience. You don't have to hold the audience by the hand and hit them over the head with emotion. Let the scenes play themselves out.The voiceovers were distracting and unnessary. It'd be like Kubrick's original idea of having voiceovers in 2001: it would've been weird, and it was definately weird here.The story, while on the outset seems like a ripoff of Pinocchio, it is definately not. Even to the point of directly referencing it throughout the film. This movie is original, bold, and not for everyone. That's the one main problem: this is not a film for the audience. This is a film for that 1 or 2 percent of the population who, on seeing 2001 in the theater, stood up and cheered. I was so floored by this film that as we walked out of the theater I stopped and shouted at the top of my lungs: ""That was F&*@ING BRILLIANT!!!"" which is what I would have said had I been in the theater of ""2001"" in 1968.I now love Kubrick more than ever.

I wish I hadn't.***Slight Spoiler*** This is a dark, disturbing fable, which begins with humans making robots to ease their own suffering, and ends with robots making humans to ease their own suffering. The difference is that the robots are a lot more compassionate.
In between lies the love and callousness of human relationships.
All of the principles actors give fine performances. Haley Joel Osment is disquietingly touching as the robot boy whose love is ""hardwired"" to his ""mother"". It is a story that seems to fall exactly between the storytelling sensibilities of Kubrick and Spielberg. Would Kubrick have made a different movie? No doubt, and one that I would have loved to see. But Spielberg doesn't seem uncomfortable dealing with the dark side of human love this story portends. Where Kubrick might have provided ironic detachment Spielberg provides pathos. Some might fight his storytelling more maudlin, I find it more emotionally integrated, and therefore more disturbing.

For the 2/3 I was very pleased and taken by the story. So much of this movie made me want to love it. This is a wonderfully realized movie and the special effects blend seamlessly, Jude Law's Gigilo Joe is very refreshing. Osmet is really good as David. It is full of startling and telling metaphor,Clearly it is a tragedy, a film about loss. It was going there, and it failed to follow through. Obviously Speilberg hasn't learned the difference between expressing sentiment and sentimentality. My suspicion is that the true end of the movie  involved revelations about the seemingly kindly Dr. Hobby as the true villan, David is exposed to the horror of his purpose and origins. He was product. This realization is what led to his seeking to destroy himself in the ocean and ending the movie at his ferris wheel grave gazing eternally at the object of his tragic obsession, the Blue Fairy.

For those of you hoping to see Spielberg's fairy tale playfulness (a la E.T.), this is not the movie for you. I did enjoy the movie, and found myself drawn in by the superior artistry of the film. But it is told as a cautionary tale told without humor or wit, as soul-less as the Robots it portrays. I got the impression that Spielberg's wish to honor Kubrick elbowed out his own instincts to humanize the characters.Haley Joel Osment is superb as the mechanical Pinocchio. His brilliance as a child actor can be measured in the scenes he plays opposite his ""brother"" Jake Thomas. It's like watching Tom Hanks opposite Ben Affleck! Women (and quite a few men) will find their hearts going out to him as he searches for his mother's love.Jude Law steals the movie in his scenes, and is reminiscent of a darker Ray Bolger in the Wizard of Oz.

520,DRomm,"Spielberg can't do Kubrick, no matter how hard he tries",7,30 June 2001,"AI Artificial Intelligence, succeeds on so many levels that it's hard to pinpoint just why it ultimately fails.  The movie started out life as a Brian Aldiss short story that intrigued Stanley Kubrick, who is given co-writing credit and to whom the movie is dedicated.  AI is Steven Spielberg's homage to Kubrick, and that gives the movie a two-toned effect that serves more to muddle the effect than to exemplify the genius of either.Kubrick is best at the static image and the slow movement that reveals human nature, usually the dark side.  Spielberg is best at the moving close-up that reveals an individual's nature, usually the light side.  We remember the robot HAL in 2001 and the destruction of civilization in Dr. Strangelove and the sex scenes that aren't erotic in Eyes Wide Shut.  We remember the grizzled fisherman of Jaws and the little kid in ET and one unit trying to find one man in Saving Private Ryan.  The discord between Kubrick's large-themed movies and Spielberg's small-themed movies is never resolved in AI.MILD SPOLIERSThe plot in AI concerns the attempt by a maker of robots, played by William Hurt, to built a ""mecha"", or mechanical being, so that a human will love him.  To that end, he builds David (one of the things I appreciated about the movie), who's a cute kid, played brilliantly by Haley Joel Osment, and places him with a family who have a sick child of that age in cryogenic freeze, presumed lost.  Without giving too much away, let's just say that things don't work out and David is forced to flee to a world where he's surrounded by robots.For Kubrick, the story (I'm guessing) was that it's easy for a robot to love:  You just program it in.  But it's hard for humans to love. Spielberg's career has been built around love stories:  Love of a town frightened by a shark, love of an alien, love of family and country, love of your fellow man.  Spielberg's Kubrickian photography is gorgeous to look at, but rarely adds to the story.  The emotional distance that's required to get into Kubrick films is the exact opposite of the emotional attachment that's required to get into Spielberg films.  Instead of Spielberg using his tricks on the human part and using Kubrick's tricks on the robot part, he uses static imagery for the humans and wild movement for the robots.  Kubrick may be smiling, but we're not.Still, AI is too well crafted to avoid seeing.  There are lots of visual tricks and thematic overtones.  My favorite little trick:  At one point, the mother, Monica (played by Frances O'Connor) is having a conversation with David outside in the cold.  You can see Monica's breath, but you can't see David's.  A small bit of business, but shows attention to detail.But Spielberg can't do Kubrick, no matter how hard he tries.  The framing sequence in Saving Private Ryan elevated this movie above other WWII movies. The added on sequence at the end of AI further muddles the point of the movie and doesn't say anything more.  He should have just ended it, and left it a fairy story.The full title is AI Artificial Intelligence, mirroring the title ET:  The Extra Terrestrial.  They share some themes and plot.  But the best parallel is last year's Bicentennial Man, about a robot striving to be a human. Robin Williams, the star of Bicentennial Man, plays a bit part in AI, which isn't credited until the end but I recognized his voice.  The thing is, Bicentennial Man succeed where AI fails.  You care about the Bicentennial Man.  David tugs at your heartstrings, but you never really love him.  The film answers the opening question:  No.  It is NOT possible to make a robot that humans can love.  How Kubrick!  How NOT Spielberg.I give a qualified recommendation to AI.  For all fans of Kubrick and Spielberg's careers, this is a must see, just to keep up with them.  But if you're looking for the next great movie from the directors of Dr. Strangelove, ET, 2001 and Schindler's list, this isn't it.",A.I. Artificial Intelligence

The end stunk and the film should have been 30 minutes shorter, there were a few things in the last half that could have been cut out. The story was a little contrived, too obvious parallels between pinochio and the wizard of oz. A strong film that makes you think, it just takes too long to do it.

522,Polter-Cow,"Worth watching, despite flaws",6,29 June 2001,"My rating of this movie (out of 10, as usual) is a *6.1 and a half*. That is much lower than I would have expected, and I may be being generous. You know how I am. I wasn't even hugely excited, and I was still disappointed.I'm going to have a hard time discussing the movie without going through the whole plot. Once you see it, I'll be glad to talk with you about it. Basically, the problem with this movie is it never figures out what its point is. It jumps from conflict to conflict, yet never seems to link them thematically coherently. I also had a very nagging problem about Henry Swinton's sudden, unexplained character change (in my eyes, he does an about-face on an issue incredibly drastically). Also, it has a Kubrick ending. The last half hour of any Kubrick ending breaks away from the rest of the movie and makes no sense.Let me regroup.Ostensibly, the movie is nothing more than a futuristic look at Pinocchio. It owes a huge debt to it, and the movie features the story prominently. David obviously wants to become a real boy. He is the first artificially intelligent robot programmed to love. This concept presents many conflicts. What is love? What does it mean to ""program love"" into a robot? If a robot can love a human, can a human love a robot? Is an artificially intelligent being considered ""real""? Do they have rights? Are they citizens? What does it mean to be human? What is the meaning of life? Will artificial intelligence ultimately destroy us? The problem with the movie is it can't figure out what to focus on, and therefore tries to focus on everything, thereby creating a disjointed storyline where characters disappear, plotlines don't resolve, and themes bounce around but don't cohere, lessening the overall effect. Everything feels like a plot device. And the ending, as I said, comes out of *nowhere*. I was prepared for the movie to end; I was even preparing my mental evaluation of the ending, because it satisfied me to some extent. Then an extra half hour of Kubrick materializes.What is good about this film? As you would expect, Haley Joel Osment is excellent. His excessive makeup gives him a look ""not quite human"" and his robotic voice is incredibly convincing. He has not blinking down to an art. Jude Law is very good as well. I liked John Williams' score, especially because he worked with some techno in a couple scenes, which was interesting. The special effects are amazing. All the robots are very, very realistic. Kudos to whoever worked on them, animatronics and effects. Also, just like the disappointing *Shrek* had its Gingerbread Man, who I felt should get his own movie, *A.I.* has Teddy. Every single scene with Teddy is a scene worth watching. Teddy plain rocks. I want Teddy.All in all, the movie is still worth watching as a whole to at least see the concepts presented, even if they're not handled very well. It's not terrible, though extremists would call it that. Most of the critical reviews have been mixed, and as my score indicates, such opinions are valid. It is a very problematic movie. Much of the time I was thinking, the game is so much better. Much more complex and interesting. But the game is not only completely immersive, but also spanning months and a whole different type of media. It would be very hard to make a movie of the game and do it justice, although, God, I would see it if someone did.Final judgment: 6.1 and a half. Worth watching, but don't expect too much.",A.I.

Along the way there is a lot of nice visuals and elements of the story are very interesting. The part of Gigolo Joe was especially fascinating and delivered deftly by Jude Law. Osment was wonderful in his role as well. Both actors are deserving of awards.

With VCR tapes going the route of LPs I said what the heck and picked up this little ditty for a pittance at the local mega-mart.  After viewing it I now consider myself one of the lucky few.What happens when you cross Pinocchio with Blade Runner and carry the idea of human callousness to its logical conclusion?  You get a pretty good flick, thats what you get.  I'm not going to give away any of the plot but consider A.I. as what remains after humans are no more and a little boy still wants a mother's love.Peripatetic Haley Joel Osment seems to be getting lots of work as the strange kid on the block.  I last saw him in Sixth Sense and he fits right in here too.  He sure hasn't grown much.  I found absolutely no flaws in anything about this film, the writing, the acting, the FX, the sound track, the futurist sets and vehichles.  No, its not a computer jock film.  I don't even think its a technology film.  It does have a lot to say about humanity though.By the way, after my tape of this film ended up came the PBS channel on TV and there was a culture show on that had some orchestra playing Richard Roger's Victory at Sea to war footage of ships being blown up and airplanes being shot down.

525,kida_fish,MOMMY........I AM CONFUSED,6,2 July 2003,"*POSSIBLE SPOILERS*The movie confuses not only itself, but also the viewer in terms of what it is trying to achieve, where it actually wants to go, and how to go about it. Initially, it starts off as a typical sci-fi movie, which exemplifies what would be one of the zeniths of the future-man's creation: the creation of custom-made robots, which not only look and feel like humans, but are also designed to exhibit a certain types of behaviors, and feel certain kinds of emotions. Then, the movie tries to answer the question, `can humans offer the same kind of unconditional love, as offered by the custom-made 'mecha'?' by taking the example of David, and how he tries to get himself accepted by a 'human'-family. The movie goes on fine through the course, which shows the various problems faced by the 'mecha', and the 'human' family, in trying to accept each other.After the point at which David is deserted by his family, the movie, then goes through a labyrinth, trying to give a totally different meaning to it, and deviating from what it had actually started off with, until the end, which again tries to continue from where it had left off, about an hour ago. Though the movie ends well, (conceptually, though again, the execution is flawed by the introduction of aliens, (or futuristic robots of the ice-age, whichever it might be) who exhume David, and try to fulfill his wish) by the time the movie arrives at this point, it has passed through so many confusing and supererogatory paths in-between, that the charm of this otherwise 'touching' ending, and the movie, as a whole is completely lost.The beginning and the ending of the movie are coherent with the punch line, `can humans respond equally to the unconditional love, the 'mecha' bestows upon them?' However, in the middle, it tries to depict that the human is, and always will be evil, by showing that the future-man will not only create the 'perfect' robot, (or make his 'best creation ever') he will also mercilessly destroy his own creation, regardless of their feelings, and the viewers are supposed to feel sorry about this. In the midst of all this, the story takes the shape of a fairy-tale, in which the protagonist, (in this case David) is in a search for the 'blue-fairy', who he believes, will make him a 'real' boy, so that his 'mommy' will love him. These links, which try to build up the ending, are not only muddled and fatuous, but also are seriously ill directed, especially the parts concerning the merciless destruction of 'mechas', at the 'flesh-fair'.Spielberg is one of the best movie-directors of all time; not half as good as Kubrik, though (since this movie is supposed to be conceptually similar to `2001: A SPACE ODYSSEY') and the best, when it comes to creating fantasy-flicks. In this fantasy-movie, however, he has tried to introduce too many ideas, which not only make the movie too long and over-sentimental, but also out-of-focus, from what it actually wants to achieve.

527,eagle_owl,Fails to deliver a coherent narrative.,3,19 April 2005,"Drawing inspiration from the Pinocchio story, this film is about a robotic child who yearns to be human. He is given to a family who are mourning the loss of their son, but soon their natural son re-appears, causing the robotic child to be sidelined.The film is clearly delineated into separate acts, which fail to come together in a coherent narrative whole. The early scenes in which the boy attempts to enjoy a normal family life could have been the basis for an interesting morality tale, but all this good work is wasted in the 2nd half, as the plot veers violently out of control.This lack of discipline is typified by Jude Law's character. He plays a 'love droid' who lives in some kind of pseudo-Blade-Runner city, but is almost totally redundant. His early section of the plot is extremely underdeveloped, and his only connection to the rest of the film is that he tags along with the robotic child for a while.The film's disjointed plot is understandable to some degree given that both Stanley Kubrick and Steven Spielberg were involved in directing. The end of the film is very reminiscent of Kubrick's earlier work on 2001: A Space Odyssey, but the twists that are required to get to this point often strain credibility to breaking point.Hampered by a lunatic plot, the film still earns points for sheer audacity. However, in striving for both entertainment and profundity it only succeeds in falling flat on its face. Spectacular both in its ambitions and the extent to which it fails to live up to them, A.I. is a major disappointment.",A.I. Artificial Intelligence

530,wmullerswm,Great movies with a few flaws,7,6 August 2017,"A.I. is truly one of a kind. It is not a perfect film, as a matter of fact it is far from perfect; however, there are also great moments in the film that make you laugh, cry, think, and thrill. This is indeed one of those movies that have numerous problems and plot holes, but one would have to be the most nitpicking person in the world to not enjoy it. I don't know exactly what role did Stanley Kubrick play, but you can see his traces everywhere. From cinematography to dialogue to the thematic message, everything smells Kubrick. The ending however is quite unfamiliar. It could have been so much better if the movie stops as David stares into Blue Fairy, prays, and the camera zooms out. The ending as it is now works, but it does not really add anything to the thematic message, and even alters it a bit. The thematic message, as I see it, is the play between eternal good and temporary evil. In this case robots are eternal and good (they would still exist after the world ends), and humans temporary and bad (the very first shot of the film illustrates the fragility of humanity, and numerous incidents in the film demonstrate how bad humans are). The quest for love, as more blatantly indicated in the movie, serves primarily for the larger thematic message: mom wants David to substitute her lost son, who is temporary; the doctor creates David as the image of his lost son, again playing the concept of mortality and immortality; David wants to be a real boy, which essentially means to die (the ""would you die mom?"" conversation at the beginning of the movie), but no one can blur the line between eternality and mortality as David sits there and prays to the Blue Fairy forever. The thematic message is very strong, yet unlike most other films it does not scream for the audience to notice. It is just there, and if you watch carefully it is natural to notice. The endings sucks because the aliens are so plot-devicive that the only effort the filmmakers put into making them is probably special effects. It also feels cheesy and kind of just forces the audience to cry. Bad ending. Two points off. The first act also does not flow very well. The pacing and performance and script all have some problems there. Another point off. Other than that, it is quite perfect.",A.I. Artificial Intelligence
531,jhendricks97,Nothing Artificial about the story,8,2 July 2001,"Steven Spielberg is a well-regarded director, with a singular style. Stanley Kubrick was also a well-regarded director with a unique and singular style. The question is, can the two styles co-exist successfully in a single movie? In `A.I.' the answer is yes, for the most part.  `A.I.' is certainly darker than one might normally expect to see in a Spielberg movie.   But I think that in this case, it works.  The special effects are fantastic, and the acting is superb.   However, it is a flawed film.I don't think it will spoil the film by telling you that `A.I.' has two endings.  The first, I believe, was clearly intended to be `the' ending by Stanley Kubrick.  But then the movie just sort of starts up again, and we get the Spielberg `ET' type ending where we find out if someone can go home again.  It's a good way to send the audience home; but its also distracting evidence that the movie is not one seamless whole, but instead the sum of its two parts.

Let me be clear: A.I. is not a good film. It's tone is completely uneven, and Spielberg's horrible reliance on sentiment makes much of the film, particularly the epilogue, make the film seem like a children's film pitched at adults. However, in an age of monotonous hollywood trash, the sheer audacity of this film makes it somewhat worthwhile. Like UNBREAKABLE, respect must be given that this film was made at all, and it certainly never would have been made without a director with the clout of Steven. Anyways, the performances are in general quite excellent, particularly Osment's, although some of his earlier scenes seemed to provoke unintended laughter in the theater I saw it.

533,evilned-1,Best movie of 2001?,9,31 May 2002,"**Spoilers within!** A.I is about a family, whose son is in a deep coma, and he has been for five years. They realize that they will probably ever see him again, and the father buys a robotic (""Mecha's they are called) boy, who is a test product, and supposedly can show love towards his mother and father, unlike any other Mecha. The mother doesn't like the idea, but after a while she starts to like boy, and starts to get mother feeling for him. However, the son who is in a coma eventually wakes up and is brought back home, to his loving parents. David (the loving mecha boy) starts to grow jealousy towards the boy, whom the parents love so much, and he is prepared to do anything to make the parents love him as much as the other boy (Martin). However he always fails, and hurts someone in one way or another. And finally the parents decide to trash him. The mother drives him to the factory, where he was created, but when they are almost there she leaves David in the forest instead. Eventually he meets another Mecha, Gigolo Joe (Jude Law, outstanding in this movie) and together they try to find a way for David to become a real boy, so that his parents can love him.I had read many bad reviews on this movie, and when my friend told me that he had seen it, and that he thought it was boring as heck, I didn't really know if I wanted to watch it or not. But I did. And maybe it is just my love for science-fiction films, or maybe this movie is truly terrific, because I loved each and every second of it. The actors (especially Jude Law) where amazing at what they did, and Spielberg had certainly created a realistic science-fiction movie.The special effects and CGI couldn't have been better. It was all great, and the plot had me glued to the television through-out. A very good movie indeed. I can't believe that anyone could not like this movie, since it is so entangling (like most Spielberg films) it is almost unbelievable! This drama is up there with American History X and Men of Honor (and many other great dramas). Something I really loved, tho, was the ending! It was happy and sad at the same time.

Jude Law seemed a little 'actory' for my taste, he'sthe only one I didn't believe.

The bottom line is that the movie is thought-provoking, dreamy, haunting, and thrilling.  Not to mention overlong, flawed, and disjointed.  I can't recommend it because you might hate it.  It's a possibility even for die-hard Spielberg fans.  At the same time, a non-Spielberg fan could find this to be his best film.  So I could recommend it because you might love it.

540,DCBlank-5,Spielberg the Bold,10,6 August 2001,"After seeing Baz Lurhmann's gutsy ""Moulin Rouge,"" I marveled that he may be the only major film director in Hollywood left with any balls. Spielberg proved me wrong.First of all, there are some things you simply cannot take away from this film. The performances, particularly by Osment and Law, are wonderful. The images are breathtaking. The ship made to look like the moon rising over the horizon was particularly memorable.Two of the most common criticisms of the film need reexamining: the depth of the subject matter and the ending of the film. While there may be valid criticisms, I do not believe enough respect has been given to Spielberg's choices. Choices have to be made when telling a story; Spielberg made them, and he didn't always make the traditional ones.The commonly held criticism that Spielberg failed to fully address the issues connected a machine capable of loving its owner - and thus sacrificing depth - is simply a let down of expectation rather than a flaw in the film. The path for the film divided into (at least) two possibilities: an exploration of the ramifications of a robot capable of love or the fantasy journey of a young robot boy to become real. Some viewers must have expected the film to be a commentary or message about humans and technology and felt gypped when they were instead confronted with a fairy tale. I personally believe Spielberg took the more interesting and what will over time prove to be the more rewarding route in the film.Also, for those who also lamented any loss of Kubrickian elements: going deep into subject matter would have been a decidedly Anti-Kubrick move. Did Kubrick pontificate on the nature of man and war in ""Full Metal Jacket?"" No, he satirized such thinking. Similarly, he did not try to give any answers in ""2001"" and instead gave us a beautiful film that we could later ask ourselves and each other questions about. Spielberg does the same in ""A.I.""Now, the ending - another choice. I admit that I thought it would end with David at the bottom of the ocean and I would probably have been content - at least temporarily - with this ending. Adding the last fifteen or so minutes was Spielberg's gutsy move. Again, it was a matter of expectation. A reeling audience member still looking for a film with a message or commentary (and they had better not be the same ones complaining about the *ending* being ""spoon-fed"" to the audience) would find these final minutes pointless. But the story wasn't finished. Would David's love last as long as he did?
A.I. is a modern fairy tale, not a social commentary. Fairy tales are stories where darkness meets light - Kubrick meets Spielberg in a mystifying, at times unusual combination of techniques and imagination.The result is an undeniably beautiful work of fantasy.",A.I. Artificial Intelligence

Its down right awful and does a good job of ruining the movie. Kubrick must be turning in his grave. There is no reason for the rubbish ending to be in there apart from Speilbergs own desire to have everything end happily, well sorry Steve-O but thats not the way things work. If it had been a younger director doing this then he/she wouldn't have been so arrogant as to entirely rewrite things.Still, apart from the terrible conclusion the rest of the movie is good, especially Jude Law and to a slightly lesser extent Haley Joel Osment.

542,chicothekid,Shame on you Spielberg. (possible spoiler),3,3 July 2001,"When this movie was initially released, I had thought that the producers really dropped the ball on this one, because they didn't begin heavily advertising this until shortly before it began showing in theaters.  What I didn't know at that time was that this was not the movie I was expecting it to be.  I knew it had Haley Joel Osment and that he was a robot boy who looked amazingly real, but that's about it.  I had no idea that the movie began on that premise and was then going to diverge onto every tangent they came across.  With that in mind, the producers did everyone a great favor by not promoting this more heavily.  Had they done so, this would have been the second Pearl Harbor of the year, the movie where everyone was expecting cinematic brilliance and got crap.  Instead, we just got another rotten movie by Steven Spielberg.The story begins like a fairly normal movie, with a family in the midst of a crisis.  Henry and Monica Swinton (Sam Robards and Frances O'Connor) have a son in a coma and things don't look good for his recovery.  Monica isn't handling things well, and when Henry is presented with an opportunity at work, to be the first to have a new robot child, he jumps at the chance to help save Monica's sanity.  David (Haley Joel Osment) becomes their new son, and things go rather smoothly until their real child awakes from his coma. Now there are two kids in the family, and competition ensues for the love of their mother.  When David reads the story of Pinocchio and learns of the fake boy being made real, he makes it his quest to do the same.  The rest of the movie is David's journey to become a real boy, so that he too, can win the love of his mother.Now I know it sounds rather noble and all, but it isn't.  The writers had some great chances to make some great social commentary, or create a movie that could really jerk at your heart strings, but they chose another route. They chose to diverge on every weird tangent they could come across, and the result is disastrous.  The only thing good about this movie is the potential it unleashed with this kind of story, but it never even came close to realizing it.  The best thing that could ever come out of this movie is if David Fincher were to come along and make another movie of a similar nature, that actually lived up to what it could have been.I had heard over and over again that the ending was really out there, but because I liked the weird kind of stuff, I would probably like this one.  I rushed out in a frenzy to watch this, and man was I disappointed.  This isn't a weird ending, this is a totally stupid ending and one that you are totally unprepared for and makes no sense at all.  I have no problem with a movie with an ending that just comes out of nowhere, but with this kind of ending, the movie had no purpose other than to waste two hours of your time. In the immortal lines of Billy Madison, ""we were all dumber for having"" watched this movie.The acting was all fine and good, but the story was just awful.  It was like they had a good idea for a movie, but had no idea on where to go with it, so they just picked the strangest scenario that someone could think up.  The movie was a big disappointment and gave nothing more than a really cool teddy bear, and a glimpse or two of what could have been one hell of an awesome movie.

544,TimeTrvlr03,Nice combination of Kubrick and Spielberg,9,2 July 2001,"When I was telling a friend about this movie, I accidentally said the director was Stanley Spielberg.  In a way, that's correct.  Spielberg tried to mesh his own ideas with those of the late Stanley Kubrick, and it really seemed to work.  You can see the elements that reflect Spielberg and Kubrick and they don't oppose each other or interrupt the flow of the film.  The storyline has that surreal quality (which is upheld also by the visual effects) that permeates every picture Kubrick ever had a hand in, combined with the elegance of Spielberg.  Another element I liked was the music.  The soundtrack was wonderful and supported the cinematography brilliantly. 
There were some potholes in the road trip of this film.  The relationship between Monica (Frances O'Connor) and David (Haley Joel Osment) is too jerky, too contrived.  The entire pattern of the relationship between David and his ""mother"" just seems to be missing the essential elements of a truly bonded relationship.  Spielburg tends to move quickly from scene to scene, but in a way that is tolerable, where you don't feel as though you have truly missed something.  It is only towards the end that you get this impression, when the narration picks up and starts to be used as filler. Kingsley narrates us through the last 20 minutes or so of the movie, which isn't as effective as it could have been.  It's like being read to.

546,filmsbythefire,A new favourite - astoundingly underrated,10,28 October 2010,"Having seen this for the first time nearly a decade after its release, I was happily surprised by this wonderful piece of work from Mr Spielberg. I have yet to see a film by this skillful director that I dislike, and A.I. is certainly not going to be the first.Set in a futuristic world, with a perhaps familiar theme of robots integrated with people, the story focuses on one small android named David (Haley Joel Osment) who is taken into a family as an experiment to see if a robot can be made to love a human, and is then forced out of his new family to fend for himself in a frightening new world.With exceptional performances from the whole cast, the real stand-outs are Frances O'Connor, playing the reluctant mother who eventually warms up to the loving robot, Jude Law, as the entertaining Gigolo Joe who aids David on his quest, and young Haley himself, who delivers a truly outstanding performance as the lovable David. Haley gets the balance between boy and robot just right; his stiff movements and unblinking eyes are the clues, the things which create that contrast between David and his 'real live' brother, Martin.It is evident just how much care went into each shot; the cinematography is superb, with haunting shots such as that of David peering through the eyes of another android like himself, or the iconic opening of the large, blue eyes. The various 'halo' shots of David with rings of light above his head are clever and subtle, and the camera work in the closing scenes is extremely well done, creating the gentle, breathless atmosphere as David joyously reunites with his Mommy.Flicking through the film channels, I only decided to watch this because I'd seen Haley in Pay it forward and, having greatly enjoyed that, decided to give A.I. a go. It was an expertly crafted piece of entertainment, artistic and thoughtful, and with a sentimental tone you would not expect to find in a movie about robots. All the emotions are delivered in a seamless blend of comedy, drama and adventure. The comedic moments (such as the hilarious outburst of laughter at the dinner table) were just as engaging as the creepier ones (the packaged 'David' android twitching as David looks on), and the ending! Very few films have had me so choked up; when David goes to sleep for the last time beside his mother, you don't care that he is just a robot - it's still an unforgettable scene well worth the two and a half hour wait.A highly recommended and sadly underrated film, we can only hope that someday this flawed masterpiece gains the respect it deserves.

A family who seemingly has lost their son to coma becomes the perfect test family for a cybernetic child who has been programmed with the ability to love and feel. When the couple's real child recovers, he becomes competitive with the robot for his mother's affections. He makes the robot seem hostile, and the couple decides to return the robot.

Excellent effects and cinematography highlight the film, whose only drawback might be its length.

554,wawain,Could have been great (spoilers),9,9 February 2004,"The story of this film is hugely ambitious: Kubrick wanted to make literally a new myth for our times (i.e. not trying to refer to past myths as Star Wars or The Matrix do). The subject of artificial intelligence is the stage of the real issue: human prejudice. I live in the U.S., so racial prejudice/issues are quite a significant part of my culture. Slavery used to be prevalent in this country. Eventually that was abolished, then we had racial segregation and legal racial hatred. Now we are left with our individual choices about prejudice. The core of this is our human perception on the question: what deserves our uncompromised respect? Roughly, we believe that, for example, a dog deserves more respect than a rock, a child deserves more than does a dog, etc. This country is proud of its ability to give equality to all, but of human nature what I see is that, whenever we encounter something that seems quite different from ourselves, we tend to be cautious and give it less respect than our quite-similar fellows. I suspect this is one reason why slavery and racial prejudice were allowed to become so prevalent in U.S. history. But over time people began to realize that, hey, they're humans too (just different amounts of melanin and vastly different cultures); human bonds can be and were formed.In the light of globalized communication/trade, It won't be long before, one way or another, however painful or peaceful the road may be, we will be united under one world culture. Essentially all humans will view each other as peers.Here is where artificial intelligence steps in. It is likely also that one day we will build machines that are controversial, because of they're uncanny ability to seem intelligent. It might even get out of hand, because soon they would seem so intelligent that they would seem to possess free will. A new prejudicial divide is born. Is it possible for humans to respect machines they engineered in the same manner they regard other humans? For if they do give that sort of respect, wouldn't it mean that humans are at the ""same level"" as the machines? It would suggest that humans are nothing *but* machines themselves! Juxtapose this with the way we treat our desktop computers and such: not much more than glorified rocks. We would be in conflict with ourselves, our worldviews. And we would have an extremely difficult time pinpointing where the rock-likeness ended and the life/intelligence began.So you see how this movie could have been a world-shaking work of art. Unfortunately (oh how unfortunately!) it failed to even take hold of my senses, let alone my emotions re: the various issues it explores. You can tell it's not made by Kubrick from the merely-par photography and set design (though there was one image that was memorable: the Statue of Liberty completely submerged except for the upraised torch). If Kubrick had been in charge the lighting would not have seemed so thoughtlessly applied. The music, while composed by John Williams, had no chance to be interesting, because it could only marry with mediocre visuals.I like to echo previous sentiments that people complain about the ending, but really the middle part was the most tedious. Wolf-bikers and rednecks? Give me a break! At this rate who cares about the mythical potential of this story? Just give me a quality-constructed film.Strangely, the advertisement for the film at the time of its release was more interesting art than the film itself. It was an interactive web game that proved to be surprisingly elaborate.",A.I. Artificial Intelligence
555,wawain,Interesting,9,1 July 2001,"What I found interesting about this movie is that it points to a dichotomy between Man and Machine. Can a human love a robot, what does it mean for a robot to love, and so on. This movie takes place in the future. But our present knowledge of science and medicine suggests to me that Man, Man's mind in particular, is made of molecules organized into structures like cells and neurons, and that the behavior of these molecules, however numerous and complex, is predictable. There is nothing in our observations so far which indicates that Man must be unpredictable; ie. beyond the grip of classical physics. In other words, I find it surprising that most movie audiences do not suggest that Man may be a Machine, one more complex than the Mechas portrayed in the movie, but one nonetheless (the movie suggests this at least one time, when the Mecha woman at the beginning puts on lipstick, and the movie juxtaposes this with Monica putting on lipstick too).Or is it? If one successfully builds an artificial intelligence by mimicking the essential features of neurons, then is it not possible that it is actually easier for these patterns of neurons to behave flexibly than it is for them to behave rigidly like a sequential computer program in C++? So these Mechas of the movie might have essentially human intelligence. Because of the way they are made, it is difficult to confine their behavior to a predictable set, although apparently it is possible to make them favor their chosen profession. While he can step outside his domain and contemplate philosophy, Gigolo Joe prefers to be a gigolo. Gigolo Joe's statement does not seem so farfetched: it is possible that humans without the obvious foresight can make machines ""too smart and too many."" But this is just a story. It probably takes a long time to make such machines, and meanwhile we can use it to think about the consequences of our actions.One thing I don't like about the movie is all the sciencefiction babble that explains to David why his mother can be brought back and must die after one Earth day.

557,bross-1,A muddled and uneven mess.,1,15 August 2001,"Sometimes too much talent can destroy a creative endeavor, which has to have been the case with A.I.  Spielberg, who was responsible for creating the term blockbuster with such crowd pleasers as Jaws and Raiders of the Lost Ark, seems to be purposely alienating his audience by both pandering to critics and insulting the intelligence of his faithful fans.  He manages to accomplish these two tasks efficiently, and in the meantime also destroys what could have been an inspired piece of social commentary.  This film should not have been made, because only Kubrick could have made it.  It was Kubrick's obsession for twenty years, and is severely damaged by the golden glow of Spielberg's patented lighting. A.I. is basically divided up into three acts. The first act is very much Spielbergian, in that it tries to pull on the heart strings without subtlety or shame.  Unfortunately, it is very difficult to identify or care for the main character David (not a fault of Haley Joel Osment, who's acting was more than competent).  It is interesting to note that Kubrick did not want a real actor to play the part, and for years had envisioned David as being either a real robot or a computer generated effect.  What this indicates is that Spielberg missed the point that Kubrick may have wished to communicate, that we may not be expected to feel sympathy for David, but rather view him in the same way we view HAL from 2001, as a comment on our lack of responsibility for that which we create. The second act is the most inspired part of the film, primarily because of its visuals and also because it contains Jude Law's performance.  Kubrick's much needed influence comes through here, and while it provides for several interesting settings and designs, this part of  A.I. would be more at home in A Clockwork Orange, and seems freakish and awkward when sandwiched between the mediocre beginning and downright horrible and bizarre epilogue. The third section is what pushed A.I. from a simply average film to being simply awful.  For some inexplicable reason, Spielberg decided to add a voice-over, which is downright insulting in its stupidity.  Also, he attempts to leave the audience satisfied with little David's fate, cushioning any social impact the film may have contained.  In addition, there are several other elements that are concerned with the evolution of artificial intelligence that may have been presented with greater purpose or significance in the hands of a more adventurous  director. A.I. is a massive disappointment in that it is from the mind of a cinematic genius and handled by the defining director of an entire generation of filmmakers, yet it manages to descend into ambiguity without purpose, and lacks the ability to engage.  This is made all the more frustrating by the fact that there is something worthwhile in this mess, yet it amounts to nothing.",A.I. Artificial Intelligence
558,dwales,The end of cinema?,5,24 September 2001,"Could this be the end of cinema? It could be the ultimate triumph of style over substance. There's no doubting Spielberg's lofty filmic ambitions and his ability to pull off the big setpiece scenes, but the emptiness and shallowness of this film leaves the viewer wondering what the point of it all is. Add to this A.I.'s ponderous sense of its own importance over 2.5 hours, and this film just about vanishes up its own backside.SPOILERS AHEADThe signs were not good right from the start as the deadly serious narrator intones ""Many years from now once the polar icecaps have melted as a result of greenhouse gases ..."" or somesuch - talk about heavy handed.  Another example is in the final sequence where in all seriousness one of the thin androids (why is it that in films like this the extra terrestrials are always in humanoid form?)advises the robotic boy in the same serious movie-trailer voice that ""It is possible for a space/time pathway to be occupied only once ..."" Talk about making it up as you go along.The problem with Spielberg is that he's always leading up to a big climactic scene - all very well, but he sacrifices everything - script, plot, character to get there. Take the final scene - contrived in every way so that we could get the robotic chap his mother's love and then lose it. And so we get some stuff about ""we can recreate her but only for one day .."" without any explanation. Also, if his mother didn't love him before, why should she love him in one day 2000 years after she's died. Frankly it's an insult to the viewer's intelligence.Look at the difference in the way Hitchcock (who shared Spielberg's fondness for the big scene) builds up to the big final setpiece. The characters, story and tension develop gradually but inexorably; then the big climax and it's all worthwhile. With Spielberg it's all just a big letdown because the build up has no substance to it.I couldn't see the point of the ""robotic love machine"" guy either- why was he in the film at all? And I have to say that the young boy tried as hard as he could but good grief did he overdo the ""Love me mommy"" bit. After a while it becomes like stating the bleedin' obvious. And when Spielberg applies the soft sugary stuff, you can hardly watch the screen for embarrassment - when 2000 year-old Teddy produces the lock of Mommy's hair from the recesses of his fur, the entire audience cringed.The problem is Spielberg takes it all so seriously. I reckon he needs a co-director who can take Spielberg's genius for the big scene and apply some quality control and lightness of touch to the rest.As a final thought a few days ago ""Duel"" was on. What a difference - taut storyline, no superfluous material, great acting from Dennis Weaver, brilliant tension, no sugary sentimentality,interpretation possible on a number of levels, and a great climax.

He handles his material convincingly and takes the audience on a ride toward ""David""'s eventual emotional maturity - It is quite an arch for a child actor!

David is the first AI which is designed to both feel and dream.Everyone, as a child, had a deep sense of longing and love for their mother, and felt insecure and helpless when separated from her. It is the strongest love and bond that exists among humans. This bond between a mother and child is developed in the first 45 minutes of the film. But a question remain, can David really ""love"" his ""mother?"" Does this make him more than a mere machine?To answer this question, the film leaves David abandoned and takes the audience into a ""flesh fair."" In the Flesh Fair, the film becomes purposefully violent to dehumanize the AI as mere machines that can be sliced, cut down, melted, and destroyed without much thought or guilt. But when David pleads for his life with horror and fear, he becomes ""human"" to the people in the flesh fair and to the movie audience.David's sole objective is to love his mother, and like a real human, hope to be loved in return. Unlike a real boy, however, David never loses his desire. 2000 years later, David realizes his dream of meeting his ""mother."" Even meeting her for only one day makes David happier than he has ever been.

568,jpellino,Great potential squandered (mild spoilers).,4,6 July 2001,"Where can I start... It was like seventeen directors and screenwriters submitted rough cuts, and Spielberg (typically a great director) took two minutes of a random, slick looking parts in rotation and assembled - well - THIS.       For three minutes at a time - the movie works - then changes tone, back story, mood, internal sense, etc...  I was at times wondering if they swapped reels from several different cuts.  The story would have made three great movies.  One film about a family coming to grips with the inevitable AI that will seep into our lives in the future.  Alas, Bicentennial Man or any of the Star Trek episodes featuring ""Data"" were more satisfying.  One film  about David's quest to become a real boy - the strand of which was sloppily interwoven with the rest of this movie - the Pinocchio motif was jammed down our throats at every turn.  It could have done with a much lighter hand.  The second act was also much too shallow, there must have been hours of potential backstory that were cut here - to its own detriment.  A third would be the more epic conclusion to David's quest, elegant use of the Pinocchio imagery and all.       But this?  A stilted first act (why can the mecha move smoothly when in a complex scene, but like an addled Furby  when fetching his pajamas? For that matter - why do the people go from understandable characters to B-movie victims at the drop of a hat?) - best first-act performance - Martin, another botched opportunity for development.  Second act - way underdeveloped. Best character - Joe - but wasted on a skimming treatment of everything else. Third act - the comparisons to 2001's ending are at best rationalizations.  (Why do the AI first use subtitles and then speak explicitly?  And with Eton accents?  For that matter, if they're so advanced, why take the form of dime-novel aliens?  Please, if the Roswell incident becomes our Rosetta stone for future intelligences...)  Dave Bowman's transformation made sense in the original story.       Jarring problems - There seems to be a trend in quick advances - Castaway's ""Four Years Later"" becomes ""2000 Years Later"" - what's next?!  Teddy might have provided a great foil - version 1 AI interacting with version X - but he was far too knowing for his meager use, and if he were that advanced...  Lots of dropped opportunities - Dr. Hobby, the potential army of Davids, all hinted at and left hanging.  Sorry to add these mild spoilers - but the internal consistency was so lacking - it was truly like watching a rough cut.  I would have given all of Frances O'Connor's artful mugging for more scenes of honest interaction between her and David - maybe it's her single status - but several  people have said that anyone who has been a mother would not have let some of those scenes thru.       In summary, this viewed like a rough cut, and I can't imagine that this was ultimately directed by Spielberg and not some assistants.

572,schmigrex,Not a Kubrick Film!,7,30 July 2001,"I am intrigued by the number of people that are buying into the ""Spielberg -- Kubrick Collaboration"" propoganda that is being used to sell this film. Kubrick played with the idea for a decade or so and finally enlisted Spielberg as director in the early 90s.  However, Spielberg backed out quickly, and at the time of Kubrick's death no plans for finishing the film were evident.  Spielberg continued the project recently after turning down other possibilities, including ""Harry Potter.""  Kubrick's contribution to this film is a substantial one -- he worked out much of the story, themes, and treatment.  But this really has to be considered a Spielberg film -- he wrote the screenplay and directed, and the entire film bears his unmistakably plush tone, for good or ill.Much has been made of the first two-thirds of the film being more ""Kubrickian.""  Well, certainly the first third takes a sterile, cold view of humanity and consumer culture, similar to the feel of films like ""Clockwork Orange"" and ""Barry Lyndon.""  The second third contains some elements of wry dark humor reminiscent of ""Dr. Strangelove"" and ""Full Metal Jacket.""  But the similarities feel more like homage to S. K. than organic exercises in storytelling, just as the Kubrick in-jokes (the Moloko Milk Bar, etc) feel cheesy and poppish.  John Williams' Wagnerian  whiz-bang score still hovers over all, reminding us of the bright-eyed director of ""ET"" at the helm. The ""flesh fair,"" an attempt at showing the ambiguous evolution of both Luddite and ""right-to-life' morality in a ""Clockwork Orange"" style is too heavy-handed to be either funny or horrifying -- an amateurish presentation of ""the old ultraviolence.""  Jude Law's Gigolo Joe character was rife with possibilities, but he is reduced quickly to playing chauffeur to Ozment's Pinocchio.  There was a lot to like in those first two-thirds, but it always felt glossy and Spielbergian, despite the dark subject matter.Ah, but the Blue Fairy!  Now there's Spielberg in all his glory.  At least ""Star Trek:  The Next Generation"" never literally dived into the Pinocchio story with its artificial boy.  Spielberg attaches the Carlo Collodi tale to his narrative in such a broad way that I may never be able to read and enjoy it again.  Only a director who reworked poor old Peter Pan to address his own mid-life anxieties (""Hook"") could have produced this slavish, overly sentimental take on a children's tale.  There's a gem of a good idea in here that follows from ""2001"" (that machines may be called upon to take up human evolution unless the humans can learn to act more, well, human), but it's all buried in the shameless tear-jerking of those last scenes.  Who isn't going to shed a tear at a poor, abandoned boy pining desperately for his long lost mother?  Did Spielberg really have to plunk the kid down in front of an ACTUAL statue of the Blue Fairy?  (I've managed to plod through 41 years of life without ever encountering one.)  The last section showed little discipline or direction, and does not follow logically, spiritually, or thematically from the rest of the film.  I actually heard groans and butt-shifting with 20 minutes left to go in the movie.  But this Pinocchio fixation should not be surprising to anyone who remembers groaning when Spielberg and Williams worked the strains of ""Wish Upon a Star"" into the score of the mother-ship scene in ""Close Encounters.""  ""AI"" ends on a sweet fairy-tale note that is everything Kubrick's films were not.I don't think this film is bad -- in fact, there's a lot to admire, especially the visual style and spectacle.  But make no mistake:  this is a Spielberg film, from an idea by Stanley Kubrick.  It is Spielbergian in its patina of wonder and romance, overshadowing even a cold, inhuman vision of the future.  And ultimately, because Spielberg simply can't make himself ride the razor's edge the way Kubrick could, it is Spielbergian because it pulls back at the end and disappoints in the gooey way we've come to expect from the most powerful director of the last twenty years.  I think Kubrick might have liked the final result. But then again, he really liked ""ET"" too.",A.I. Artificial Intelligence

Human and robot interaction, computers with human intelligence and emotions???  But in Spielberg's hands, the movie became MI,  Mediocre Intelligence. It was evident from the very beginning of the movie that Spielberg and his team did not have the intellectual depth to make this movie.  This movie is filled with ideas and scenes from other movies such as Star Wars, Tommy, Close Encounters Of the Third Kind, etc etc.   Not only that, the scenes were badly filmed, in a hazy style that did not fit the scene and the movie. The cinematography is mediocre.  Adding insult to injury, the music score is by John Williams, and did not fit the movie.  The music was so bad and inappropriate I sat there stunned, when I was not wincing from the movie itself. When one hears reviewers extol the special effects in the movie, one knows the movie has nothing else to offer.  What surprised me, is that there were very few stunning, new, interesting special effects.  The only memorable ones were of a few robots.  And Spielberg made sure you noticed them by showing the same effect over and over and over again. So what does the movie AI boil done to???  What was the main focus of the movie????  It's a young boys search for his mother's love.granted the young boy is a robot, but the movie still boils down to that same old schmaltz.Mommy, Mommy, I love You!!!!  Please love me!!! Where are you???? So what can I praise in this movie?  Only the acting of Haley and Jude Law. They did the best they could with the awful script they were given.  Haley gives a sustained perfect performance, quite amazing for his age. The last part of the movie where David is trying to find his mother and become a real boy went on and on forever, interrupted now and then with a syrupy voice over reminiscent of a Disney movie.  When the movie finally ends, and the credits started rolling, all I could do was hissss when Steven Spielberg's name was shown. There is so much that could have been done on the subject of AI and robot/human interaction.  One only has to read the Robot series of novels and stories by Isaac Asimov.  Is Steven surrounded by nothing but yes men? Did no one have the guts to tell him he was making a real stinker?  I sat there in the theater embarrassed for him.  How could he have made such a bad movie, and especially one given to him by Stanley Kubrick?????",A.I. Artificial Intelligence

The sudden reality of the essense of the film goes beyond of what I was actually expecting.  Goodness!  The film is a prophecy in the making really. It seems just like a little fairy tale, but its not.  Will we let ourselves reach this type of demise...in our own making?  The film has breathtaking visual effects...some of the best that I have seen.  Like Roeper said on his review, ""it actually looks like NYC is under water.""  Haley Joel Osment has really outdone himself this time.  I see another Oscar nomination in his future.  He would probably win this time. 
However, this is what you expect when you put 2 legends of directing, a good cast, and smart story and good drama together.  I wasn't expecting less from Spielberg to begin with.Recommendation: Adults just go see the film.  I don't think a child will sit through the film.  There is some action in the film and it does it loud at points, but it won't excite the child.  I don't know where the critics and reviews got 140 running time from, but I calculated 3 hours and 15 minutes...excluding previews and not adding credits.

575,Viz79,And people actually dislike this film? Thats the tragedy...,10,27 September 2003,"I actually ended up seeing A.I quite a bit later than its screen release, when it came on one of the cable movie channels, simply because of some of the scathing reviews. And also why I will never ever see another movie again depending on reviews - I will make the decision myself to see it excluding such things. The movie is a true masterpiece and the fact that I was blubbering like a child at the end, wondering why I was 'leaking' so severely was interesting in itself.The whole issue has to do with the fact that people feel that it was a Kubrick film that was Spielbergised. You know what - people should see the movie and forget this issue - enjoy the fairy tale and see it for what it is. Forget the whole 'oh Kubrick would have ended it 20 mins before the end' because while I did imagine for a moment that the film was about to end at that scene, the movie moved forwards. And I actually loved what Spielberg did for it. I would not want the heart ache of the Kubrickised ending, I want the more peaceful ending of Spielbergs. And more importantly, people need to stop overanalysing the 'realism' a film that is simply a fairy tale told with various issues in mind - of life, of what really is important within it and how the little robot boy who was in reality more human that most 'humans' themselves! How a mother and childs bond is something that simply can never be described, something that Spielberg drives in and Kubrick may actually have missed, and the biggest question of what life really is, and whether it needs to only be flesh and blood?So many questions, it is profound yet told beautifully and the acting is superb. It is a combination of work of two of our greatest directors and people should be happy with it is as it is. I suspect people that are so cybical of it are those that go in neither willing to think or feel, but simply to experience - the typical popcorn movie goer. Unfortunately A.I manages to be ironic one last time by unintentionally pointing out via the film that those people that really enjoy this movie are likely more human than the A.I like 'robots' that will overanalyse and criticise it without attempting to 'feel'. The simple truth whether you like it or not.
Finally, I am glad I have another movie that I can add to my 'personality test' list. The first was 'The Blair Witch Project' in which I reasoned that if you did not have a personal dislike of horror movies AnD you saw it in decent conditions, especially audiowise and still disliked it, you were lacking in the rather important requisite for intelligence, a decent imagination. In A.I, I simply feel that if you do not like it, you are simply less human than you should be :)Go see it, and find out which you are ;)",A.I. Artificial Intelligence
576,amolghadi,The Story of us and The Most Realistic Non-Exaggerated Practical Scientific Movie ever made.,10,12 August 2008,"Plot: This movie is a story of us, humans in not-so-distant future where global warming and greenhouse effect have taken its toll and sea level all over the mother earth has risen beyond danger levels due to melting of polar ice and continental areas have submerged in the water partially and hence their surface areas have reduced, barely supporting some Homo Sapiens (human beings) for their livelihood. But those humans have done considerable progress in all fields, especially Robotics.Storyline: This is a movie about a robot child adopted by a couple whose only son is suffering from some grave illness and is placed in a cryogenic chamber in a comatose situation. There are almost no hopes of him being recovered and hence the couple decides to adopt a artificially intelligent (possessing a self learning processor) robot child called 'David'. Initially he is just a robot coming to grasps with his new surroundings, his new family. But then as time passes on he starts adapting himself to the humans. Then one day the comatose son of the family recovers suddenly and then he has to share the love of his parents with David, the robot. But then the human child, under pangs of jealousy, mistreats David till his mother decides to have David disassembled and hence takes along with her to the manufacturers. But the 'mother' factor in her does not have the heart to do that and so she leaves him mid-way in a jungle. Here David meets a Robot who works as a Gigolo and has run away from the world. And then this movie is the saga of their adventure together as they travel.Acting: Perhaps the most mesmerizing in the world considering it comes from a child - Osment(Sixth sense, The(1999)) as the Robot. No, wrong ... Let me rephrase it. OSMENT 'IS' THE SELF-LEARNING, ADAPTING, TRANSFORMING ROBOT.Undoubtledly best by any child in movie-history considering the demands/complexities of the role. Jude Law's performance is ON PAR with Osment's but he is shown to us as the already adapted robot so no more major transformations in personality here.Connor's performance of the heart-broken mother made me speechless.What NOT to expect: If you are a fan expecting that a sci-fi movie ONLY means black leather, Ray-Bans, bullets, guns, explosions, ruthless man-killing robots and mind-boggling action scenes, this is not the movie for you. Sorry, but ordinary life situations in a realistic sci-fi movie do not demand fireworks. (I do love the Terminator / The Matrix series but they are a LOT futuristic and contain Time warping events.) 'AI' is a LOT PRACTICAL and talks of only practical near-future life of any ordinary human being / Robot.What to Expect: Mind-boggling performances and even more Stunning Visual Effects Extravaganza. A flawless direction and script considering the demands of the movie. Remember, its easy to make a series of totally-out-of-the-world 'Star-Wars' movies but very difficult to create one single practical movie like this. Get Real.This is the Ultimate Masterpiece in cinema history. Simply because it not only required realism/practicality as a base to the Plot but also Brains and Science. Also the Emotional and Philosophical Factors in this movie will undoubtedly touch any existing living human being who understands English. But the technicalities depicted in this intelligent film (...And I am not talking about the visual/sound effects of the movie) can be only be grasped (not totally but still...) by those in the engineering fields especially Software(like me), Robotics and Electronics, basically anyone from the field of Artificial Intelligence. This movie is made for people like us. People like us don't care if this movie becomes the Greatest blockbuster of all time or not. Simply because this movie satisfies us.Ironically, this is movie has not been made keeping the ordinary non-technical movie loving public in mind even though it IS concerned with the near-future of all human beings.Perhaps this is the ONLY perfect example of any masterpiece voted down by some people NOT because they did not like it BUT because they did not like it since they did NOT understand it in the first place. It is the various Technical Theories in this masterpiece that some people could not properly interpret and digest. This movie takes itself seriously and correctly so. Also only two types of movies never win any Oscars: 1. The 'Razzie trash' types that don't go well with the critics because they are way below the IQ of the critics and hit below the belt. 2. The 'Artificial Intelligence' types that don't go well with the critics because they are way ABOVE the IQ of the critics. This movie belongs to the second category i. e. a category of itself.This is Kubrick's Best but this is better than Spielberg's supposedly 'Best': 'Schindler's List(1993)'. Because 'List' deals with the traumas of war-stricken humans and is a easier-to-sympathize-with history chapter BUT this movie is much more complex / challenging and requires intelligence to create a REAL near-future life of humans that is yet to happen and yet teaches us 'Love'.Terminator / Matrix Series get a 9/ 10. 'Artificial Intelligence' gets a complete 10 / 10.Buy/ study this movie and Enlighten yourselves.",A.I. Artificial Intelligence

578,brianwolters,Very Uneven,3,4 January 2005,"I sat down to A.I. expecting a movie full of wonder and amazement. I got that at times. At other times, I wanted to turn it off. When it was finally over, I really wanted to like this film but I just felt like I was in a ship on stormy seas and was seasick from it all. The movie starts out in a very somber tone. It explains how the earth is suffering the effects of global warming and the creation of robots, specifically one who can love. David, the loving Robot, is purchased by a family whose own son is on life support. Soon enough, the son improves and the mother decides she doesn't need David anymore. So she drops David and Teddy (the best and warmest character in the movie) in the woods and David goes on a journey to become a real boy and to earn the love of his mother.This is a very sad way to start the film, but it is then that we start to see a little of a ""quest"" in the movie (a la Wizard of Oz) and it begins to feel magical. Then, we get depressed again as we are introduced to a ""pleasure robot"" and how a woman is afraid of his ""functional abilities."" This totally lurches the movie from a kind of magical quality to in your face smut. Then, we see a ""flesh fair"" in which defective robots are destroyed in an arena to the delight of the humans. Then, we are taken to a city which has buildings in the shapes of women in provocative poses. I knew this was a pet project of Kubrick but I didn't know a lot of his perverted imagery and characters would be included in the film. Once we get past that, then we have a few more magical moments and then we are introduced to more dark images and finally, more magical moments. By the time it is all over, I was exhausted. Did I like the movie? I liked the Spielberg ""moments"" but I disliked the Kubrick ones. This maybe what they had intended but to me, it made for a very uneven and overall unsatisfying film.",A.I.

In the modern world, robots are developed and used in various places. As a person who lives in such a world, I feel I should think about the relationship between humans and robots.

580,HorrorweenComposerTony,A true masterpiece.,10,23 October 2005,"Kubrick films always had the problem of being misunderstood for their time. That I believe is due to Kubrick reaching out for broader visions and questions and answers that simplistic audience expectations do not see. As an example, while ""A Clockwork Orange"" shocked and outraged due to the ultra violence, very few of the viewers realized the true nature of the movie, the morality of the loss of choice.A.I. works on many levels, with the problem being that the main audiences today are raised on a pablum of 15 minute talentless stars and copycat story lines. When presented with a movie which has many moral and philosophical questions, they simply walk out of the theater.A.I. was the perfect mesh of many talents coming together at the right time. It is a shame that Kubrick did not live to see the final cut. By passing the torch onto Spielberg, he helped give the movie the heart that Kubrick himself was not capable of giving it. Some may claim it to be a schizophrenic pairing, but I consider it to be perfection. More depth and from many angles.Sure, the story may not be original. Our responsibilities to those who we love and who love us, Pinnochio, and the story of the civil war and slavery. But those are touchstones to build the entire story on.Haley Joel Osment proves himself to be literally the finest child actor who ever existed by carrying this technically and emotionally demanding film. The audience that is capable of grasping the concepts and understanding of this film (as opposed to the other kind of audience who walks out and goes to catch the next Paris Hilton feature as the height of their intellectual capacity). The audience who can understand and identify with the concepts will be able to travel with David through his journey and sufferings as an innocent lost child who lost the love he cares for the most.10-20 years from now, this is a movie that will be very much a requirement in film schools or philosophy classes.

(Except Star Wars.)  But, be that as it may, they all share the same disastrous prone tendencies. The critics despised them. Years later, the critics who ridiculed these classics are forced to eat their words. Vertigo is now considered to be Hitchcock's master work over Psycho, Rear Window and North By Northwest. Star Wars is thought of as a milestone in Hollywood history with it's visual effects and unprecedented cult following. Fight Club has launched a mass production of marketing including hats, shirts and posters, all which can be found conveniently at your local Suncoast. And for the year 2001, there was A.I.It has been months since I have seen Steven Spielberg's latest film.  As his first film in several years, I anticipated a fairly good show.  Besides, it was in joint with my favorite director, Stanley Kubrick who had passed the project on to America's most beloved director. After Kubrick's death, I was baffled as to whether or his unfinished project Artificial Intelligence was to be made or remain in pre-production limbo forever. When I heard that good old Spielberg was to take over the project, I felt relief knowing no one else alive could tackle a Kubrick film like the master of emotion. I traveled to the theater two days after it's release. Going to a moderately late show, I remember the theater was extremely cold; metaphorically ironic considering it was the beginning of July. The metaphor being that Artificial Intelligence was a chilling story of a mecha boy who traveled through the remains of a post-apocalyptic society to become a real boy. As we have learned throughout history, the world is not always as ""warm"" as one thought.Taking place in the near future, the polar ice caps have melted and flooded coastal cities. As the surviving civilization scramble to the middle of the continents, they begin to create advanced sophisticated forms of robots. A visionary robot manufacturer has created a landmark Artificially Intelligent toy. His name is David, who is played brilliantly by Haley Joel Osment. David's function: To give and receive natural love from his unnatural parents.  We than cut to a father and mother visiting their son, who is diagnosed with an incurable disease. As he chills away in his cryogenic chamber, the parents of he come to a decision. The result is their adopting David in place of their dying son. In order to fully complete his meaning, David must be activated by a seven word combination. For David, he belongs forever to his parents. The only way for him to avoid his longing for love without them would be to disconnect him from service. The unfortunate circumstances of her hapless natural child causes Monica to imprint David. As David receives the love of his mother, a miracle takes place: Monica's natural son returns cured of his disease.As the two children begin a game of rivalry, David's brother contemplates ways in order to get him in danger out of vivid jealously. Eventually, Monica reluctantly decides to take David back to the manufacturer to have him deactivated. Her heart is too big to have him disassembled, so she abandons him in the woods with ""Teddy"". This is the sweet tale of the story. Spielberg's version. The fantasy world. A happy environment where nothing goes wrong. Out of nowhere, we are introduced to Kubrick's nightmarish world in which we are forced to reexamine the cold hard reality we have ventured into.In a long, Kubrick-like zoom, we track away from a man's face played by Jude Law in one of his best performances. A Sex toy robot named Gigolo Joe is working with one of his clients; a first-timer who hired him to ""perform his services."" As he secludes and hides from those who hunt him, we begin to understand what we have entered. The dark visions ensue. The Flesh Fairs. The incessantly daunting police. The callous manufacturers who make mechas and than commend them for being unique, but not authentic. It is THE real world we have entered. Mechas are hunted by humans (or orgas) for not being licensed and are disintegrated sadistically by their captors. And than there is Rouge City, whose decadent sexual themes are thrown around as calmly as the economical symbolisms of New York's modern Stock Market. In a chance meeting, David congregates with Gigolo Joe. The two journey in search for the blue fairy, who will allegedly make David a real boy. This takes them to the end of the world, A haunting recreation of Earth's most recognizable city underwater: New York. Both characters are representatives of Spielberg's childhood fantasy world and Kubrick's bleak anarchist world. David being Spielberg's compassionate, yearning and affectionate protagonist. And Gigolo Joe being Kubrick's icy, comical and methodical antagonist.Many people hated this film, audience and critical alike mostly because of the weak ending. I admit, I left the theater disappointed of the lack of substance. But now I feel a subtle warmth towards the film and even the ending. To me, it was necessary for it to end on a blissful level; it's character began that way. It is my belief that a film should metaphorically close the way it opened. And in a way, the ending is a good representation of that. Had it ended where most thought it should had, the positive elements of humanity would have been lost like David in the sea.

This misconception is that Kubrick's original story ended at a certain point, and that Spielberg then tacked on 20 minutes of superfluous, nauseating schmaltz. It turns out that this is not the case, at all. If you read the Kubrick FAQ you'll see that the final 20 minute sequence was in fact always intended by Kubrick himself. You'll see that he even had to fight one of his writers for it to remain in the script. It is now my firm belief that Spielberg remained as absoulutely faithful to Kubrick's vision as he possibly could.

You'll see that he even had to fight his co-writers on keeping it in the script. You'll see that apparently Spielberg was EXTREMELY true to all of Kubrick's major ideas. One thing that must be understood about Kubrick is that he had a very positive affinity for ""technological entities"", or whatever you wish to call them. While he was about as cynical as one can be regarding humanity, he had high hopes for artificial intelligence. He had a certain affection for them. Here is a direct quote regarding AI from Kubrick himself: ""I think the ideal director for this may be Steven Spielberg. If I do it, it may be too stark. I may emphasise too much the philosophical side."" It is clear that Kubrick intended AI to be warmer than he himself was capable of. Shame on any of you who thought those were aliens. While it isn't stated explicitly, my theory is that David, or perhaps I should say ""David® and Darlene®"" were directly responsible as the catalyst which led to the evolution of mecha who clearly had emotions. It seems to me that the super-mecha have a very genuine, loving care for David. What they do for him at the end of the story serves no purpose other than to make him happy. Also, the final ending serves to close a full-circle; the story begins with a society of humans building a robot to fulfill the emotional need of a person.

On the contrary, in this long, labored and deeply flawed movie melodrama is abundantly used, over-used and ultimately abused. The movie does not have even traces of Kubrick's signature elements - no virility, no originality and no ingenuity.Spielberg, more often then not, caters to the lowest emotional denominator. Kubrick goes for the intellect. At its best(Color Purple, Schindler's List) Spielberg rivals Kubrick in the movie-making bravura. Commercial concerns have frequently contained his cinematic achievements though. His pampering to popular culture and the market place rather that to more cultivated audiences regretfully reduces his stature as an auteur.You don't want to feel like walking out on a Spielberg movie. Not on Spielberg. But, you don't want to feel exploited and manipulated by a movie. Not by Spielberg's.",A.I. Artificial Intelligence
591,EvilTommy,Top-of-the-food-chain to antediluvian epic,8,27 August 2003,"I avoided this film when it was in the theatre and then when it came out on DVD, perhaps because it appeared to me in the trailer to be just another Spielberg fairy tale with the usual light show. I regret now not having given it a chance. Osment was his usual brilliant self as the prodigy and Jude Law was incredible as Gigolo Joe. Their performances both deserved recognition by the academy. It was a rather lengthy film, but I really never got tired of David's episodic adventures, particularly after he'd met his own capering Scarecrow. It was an interesting look at a society which had built in it's own obsolescence. Asimov's 'I, Robot' had a similar theme.Give it a look! 8/10",A.I. Artificial Intelligence
592,Stevenuccj,Flawed but still an exceptional achievement,9,16 July 2001,"This film is certainly carried by the acting of Haley Joel Osment and, to a lesser extent (him not being the lead), Jude Law.  Had these two performances been any lesser than what they were, and they were amazing, the film would have likely flopped.  Osment beautifully portrays a robot who looks like you and me, and loves like us, but ultimately is still just a robot, not one of us.  He is not a shy, scared boy who can't fit in (6th Sense), but he is an outsider who really IS different from other boys, and he is desperately seeking approval from his mother in the form of her love.     The plot of this movie has been summarized numerous times, so I will avoid repetitiveness (?) and just comment on specific portions of the film. I have mostly good things to say about the first two thirds of the movie; Osment anchors the movie and his performance evokes feelings of desperation, compassion, and hurt from us along with moments of comedy and a sense of wonder and anticipation throughout.  When Law joins him, the comedy and entertainment picks up while still advancing the story at a slow but deliberate pace.  The scene where we see haters of the machines in massive numbers destroying them plays out as too long and rather boring; it manages to at least advance the two characters, but Speilberg should have seen how weak the scene was and deleted/ replaced it.      The final third of the movie is the most controversial, and the most criticized, for good reason.** SPOILERS BEGIN **The first 2/3rds of this movie, and especially the first third, is very dark.  We consistently feel uncomfortable, and scared for what might happen to Osment; more specifically, what other PEOPLE might do to him, because he is a machine and he doesn't learn how to act ""normal"" in routine social situations.  We learn early on that this is hands-down Spielberg's darkest movie, and it is most certainly not for kids.  But the ending, no matter how much you like, hate, understand or are confused by it, enjoy it or are frusturated by it, It Is A Happy Ending.  It is really a Disney/Twilight Zone ending, if there ever was one.  David gets his mother's love, only in the not-too near future.  The ending negates the darkness of the movie (no doubt it is only dark due to Kubrick's influence on it).  The ending represents where Spielberg tries to tie in his own ""successful long magnificent journey"" type film with Kubricks ""dark human nature"" exploits. The result, as you have seen, is a muddy ending to a magnificent story.

But no, they had all that stupid ""Blue Fairy"" stuff at the end. What a horrible ending for an otherwise fine movie! And the plot didn't have to be so much like ""Pinnochio""! The whole cast gives excellent performances, though. Jude Law is fantastic as Gigolo Joe, Frances O'Connor gives a very emotional & believable performance as Monica Swinton, and last and not least, Haley Joel Osment is brilliant as always.

The movie is a very good Sci-Fi flick, with an intelligent story line, good acting and great special effects used with efficiency.Haley Joel Osment is not giving a performance as good as in the Sixth Sense but he sure confirms he knows how to act and understands the script (something not every child actor does). Jude Law is truly amazing in his character and William Hurt just being the usual William Hurt (he reminded me a lot of the character he played in Until the End of the World).The story line has lots of good ideas.

The rest of the plot is like a compilation of several faery tales, with absolutely dull and painfully overlong ending.

Gimme a break, all the intellectual challenge is wasted in the first 45 minutes within several tear-jerking scenes with David´s (the robot boy) teddybear and his mother abandoning him in a deep forest.

They rely very shallow on special effects and do not appreciate a movie, where they have to think. Increasingly, we are seeing a vast difference of opinions between IMDB and AFI list of the greatest movies ever made. the difference is simple, generational and lack of taste. The great masters offered tremendous entertainment over the years, most of the comments are part of our cynical confused society. The common complaint by your users is usually critical of the lenght of the movie, which confirms their intellect and lack of attention span. you cannot teach piano to someone who is not gifted, It is sad, that Mr. Kubrick, and Mr.Spielberg, were not able to co-direct this movie, However in the absence of kubrick,spielberg,got it and the style of one of his heroes is reflected.this movie was made for the big screen, and, t.v.doen't do it justice. the negative reviewers, would probably find fault in the Bambi movie, get a heart folks,because that is what the movie is all about. the dismissal of our humanities, which is an ongoing process. Machines,that have more passion and genuine goodwill. I believe what makes most viewers dislike this movie, is the illustration of the darkest side of our ultimate destiny, and, that makes them uncomfortable. The conclusion of the movie is not corny,it is a summary of our cruelties and frailties. Pretty sad when the I.A.'s have more humanity than us.

The most impressive thing about this film is how it can get more worse and worse with every minute. There is no end to it - after half of the tragedy one thinks that there could be an end to it, but Spielberg just adds more unrealistic things to it. It's a Sci-Fi movie, but that does not mean that it doesn't need to explain anything. It is also a fairy tale, but still the director could have tried to entertain at least some of the grown ups sitting in the audience.Humans are the cruel ones, the first build up artificial intelligence and then they kill the machines, who all seem to be very nice and full of feelings - although they do not have, only the little boy has. Still these robots talk and act as if their primary mission in ""life"" would be the protection of the weak and forgiving their destroyers. Oh please Steven, tell us about the Christians in ancient Rome if you want to bring tears in our eyes, but don't come up with a miserable idea that you manage to develop into a great failure.And then, at the very end of the whole mess, when the aliens hang around and the story has long crossed the point of no return, Spielberg gives the child, that has gone through suffering and pain, a single day of happiness. That's it. I assume this should tell us something about being human and life in general. But it doesn't. It only tries to induce some sentimental feelings in the audience  without succeeding.The issue of the machine that wants to be human was treated much better by other films, foremost of all ""Blade Runner"" but also ""Bicentennial Man"" was an acceptable movie, that is also suitable for younger audiences.

I would almost guess that this is where, the generally dumbed down direction of Steven Spielberg took over.

I'm a huge Kubrick fan and I apreciate Spielberg material, but it all honestly I was dying for the credits to appear, so I could leave. Even the title, made the film sound tacky - the abbreviation of phrase, which is anticipated to become common place in the future. BUT FILMS ABOUT A.I. HAVE BEEN DONE BEFORE, THERE IS NOTHING NEW HERE.If the film (SPOILER) had ended when David was begging the Blue fairy to be 'real' this film could be satisfied with being below average. But the 15 or 20minutes which followed were cringeworthy. When it said '12' at the beginning of the film, I always thought that meant you were supposed to be 12 or over to watch- but surely only little kids could appreciate this awful ending. If this film had been revolutionary in terms of ideas or special effects -it might have been able to pull it off. But there were no new ideas here really, the idea of rising sea levels (Waterworld), artificial intelligence (Terminator), flying cars etc - have been the worked of sci-fi films for 20 years or more. This film seemed to just drag little bits of other noted sci-fi/futuristic films and lamely put them together.The story was dull and uninteresting, (despite some excellent acting by the 'I see dead people' boy) - and the whole way the Mother fell for the freaky, weird mecca boy was totally unrealistic. Underground lost (American) cities, which is obviously the centre of the universe - because other countries never exist in the future - were so lame and thoughless. I could criticise this film all day, and more constructively if I want to put my mind through the ordeal again  - but mistifies me is the involved of Kubrick (you except soppy Disney style garbage now and then from Spielberg). After a near faultless career - where my only criticism would be he didn't make more films -- how did Kubrick get involved in this - or perhaps his involvement was minimal and name used for Marketing.

608,venkat_rs,Another brilliant movie from Spielberg,8,13 December 2001,"This movie is based on a short story written about three decades ago, and raised quite a bit of expectations as it involved a collaboration between the late Stanley Kubrick (2001: A Space Odyssey, Eyes Wide Shut) and Spielberg.As is obvious from the name and promos, the movie deals with a robot equipped with an advanced form of artificial intelligence, that of giving and expecting love. What better way to do it than with a kid!And who better currently than Osment (The Sixth Sense) to play that role! The boy scales amazing heights, even being able to show measured emotions just like a robot would. Law steals the show in a cameo appearance.The movie manages to bring up various relevant questions and pointers about the future, for which a special round of applause is warranted. Towards the end, the viewers' heart-strings are tugged at strongly. However, the pace is mostly slow. Needless to say of a Spielberg movie, the technical standards are simply brilliant, even as the background score lends able support. His obsession with fairy tales continues, this time around with Pinocchio.

However, there is one element that I think Kubrick would have done differently, and the film is saved by excellent performances that save the change.After David is abandoned, the movie suddenly shifts to Joe, the android gigolo. We learn why he does what he does, without having to get into too many details. Then, just as abruptly, Joe is apparently set up for murder, to place him in ""big trouble"" and oblige him to turn fugitive. All this is done to support his meeting up with David, and providing a motivation for him to help David.I think it would have made more sense for the plot to go like this. We do not meet Joe until David meets him, while both are in the woods with the other fugitive androids. After Joe and David escape, David would learn about Joe's work first hand, because Joe would ""work"" to get them money and/or transport.

I was left with three unanswered questions:1) Who (or what) does Joe work for? As a robot, Joe would not necessarily have a need for money himself. Who is profiting from his work, and making his ""appointments""? If he is working independently, why? If he is capable of choosing to work on his own, doesn't that imply he has a free will?2) What was to be gained by framing Joe for murder, and confronting him with the killer? It would only work if the murderer destroyed Joe as well. Presumably, there would be a way to access an android's memory and discern the truth of the matter. Just connecting the android with the corpse would not explain the murder.3) Aside from a graphic description, what did Joe have to offer the young guys in the car in return for a lift to Rouge City? Money? No. Access? Seemed as if anyone could just drive in. Services? If Joe set something up, it was done offscreen. Information/directions?

611,klantry,About the Professor (SPOILER WARNING),9,19 July 2001,"At the beginning of the film, we're asked if a human could be compelled to love a machine.

The Swintons are singled out because of their biological son's tragic illness. Much later in the film, we learn David has been made in the image of Hobby's late son, also named David.
Now, the easy response would be to conclude Hobby's motivation was to ""resurrect"" his David. But if that were the case, Hobby would have had David ""imprint"" on himself. I think Hobby is a cold, calculating SOB, who wants to mass produce ""David""s, but needed to prove the ""imprinting"" program worked. To that end, he picks a family that has lost a child, knowing David will be drawn into the void in their souls. Then, once David is abandoned, Hobby doesn't intervene to retrieve David, but manipulates the situation to allow David to further validate the programming. For me, the most horrifying aspect of the film was the ""5 year warranty"" the mass produced David's were to be marketed with. You produce a being capable of ""loving"" and being loved, but without growth or free will, that will ultimately break down or have to be destroyed - because it loves only its master.",A.I.

612,Pzippity,2/3 of a great movie,9,2 July 2001,"Compared to the mindless drek (not Shrek, drek) constantly spewed out by the Hollywood movie machine, this film is a masterpiece.  It actually has the audaciousness to make you think, and at its heart, underneath all the Spielberg smoke and mirrors, it presents us with a truly frightening ethical dilemma: what is our responsibility for what we create?  This dilemma is elucidated in the first few minutes of the movie by one of Dr. Hobby's colleagues, and it remains to haunt us throughout the entire film.  What the movie boils down to, at least for me, is that if we are going to play God, then we'd damn well better be aware of the consequences of what we create. If we are going to create sentient machines, complete with human feelings and emotions - something that will be technologically possible in the very near future - we'd better be really sure what we are creating before we do it.  If only the creators of the atomic bomb had taken the time to examine the consequences of their actions!  However, that said, the movie is only about 2/3 good.  The ending is pure Spielberg, as if he had painted such a dark picture in the first two acts that he couldn't stomach it and had to try to tack on some sort of feel-good happy ending (sort of).  I thought it told us more about Steven's unresolved oedipal conflicts than resolving anything in the movie.Finally, I'd like to put a plug in to the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences.  If Haley Joel Osment doesn't win an Oscar for this performance, then there truly is no justice in the world.  His performance is truly otherworldly.  Not only doesn't he blink the entire movie, but try to see if you can spot him breathing!

This Spielberg's movie has a personal touch of Kubrick, it may be 2001's influence but for me science-fiction only now, with this movie, has returned to it's golden age, I hope that others of Kubrick's great projects are placed on screen, the public always likes it and it´s money well invested 'cause it always comes back.",A.I.

614,SpiderPants,I wonder...,7,29 July 2001,"This could have been a truly great piece of work, but unfortunately, after much thought, I feel like it just can't be done. The movie is based on a short story, but there are obvious parallels to the story of Pinochio. A toy is created, and then that toy is granted consciousness. The toy, in the movie, is a Robot played by Haley Joel-Osment; it's meant as a substitute child for people wanting children of their own but cannot. In this case however, the two people were already parents, but their son was sick and comatosed. After awhile, their true son is returned to them, and this creates obvious conflicts. The Robot boy is made to leave, and then he goes out in search of becoming a real boy, so that he will become accepted. This is the major cause for problems that occur at the end of the movie. This movie isn't a real fairy tale. We're told to believe all of the things that happen in this movie, as if they are possible. And for the most part, we have no trouble doing that. The superb acting of Osment lets us believe that he is a robot trying to conquer the gap between human and machine. But as it seems apparent, the last thirty minutes come off as a completely other movie in itself. The events that transpire in the end are ludicrous, and they left me bored and wishing the credits would come rolling up, even though I knew it wouldn't happen. The happy ending that Spielberg tries for left me annoyed. It would appear that the real problem in this movie that tries to live up to a fairytale, is that there is no reasonable way to make a robot into a real boy. He will never genuinely love, because he was only programmed. I am hoping that there will be a director's cut to this movie. I think with some editing, it could be a far superior film to what is being watched now. Everything was well done. The acting, directing, and the special effects were all wonderful and beautiful. There were just plot holes that left the movie having to go in a ridiculous direction. And if Spielberg could peruse himself into avoiding the happy ending, there could be a much better ending that wouldn't bore me and roll my eyes.~Christopher",A.I. Artificial Intelligence

The first 8-10 comments I have read make me think that there was something wrong with me when I first viewed this sham of entertainment. So, I watched the first thirty minutes or so again.  No, it is truly the worst movie, at least to me it is.  I am obviously out of step with the rest of the U.S., but that's ok.  I wouldn't recommend this movie if they were having a FREE showing.

617,mike-bozart,High hopes ... crash out stunningly,6,18 August 2016,"> SPOILERS ALERT <The good: 1. The first third of the movie; the premise is quite believable in the not-so-distant future, considering the way robot technology is accelerating; the scenario seems plausible. 2. The young actor who plays a near-human 13-year-old boy-robot is excellent; a hands-down first-rate performance. 3. Special effects. As you might have guessed with a big-budget Spielberg film, they are mind- boggling excellent.The bad: 1. The movie, which runs - or crawls - in at about 140 minutes, is way too long. I mean, way, way, too long. It actually consists of three separate movies linked by the slenderest of stupefying threads. My 13-year- old son, who I hoped would relate with the boy-robot, walked out on it (we recently rented it on DVD) at the 55-minute mark. 2. The last 2/3 of the movie is unbearably saccharine and 'goo-goo' cutesy to no end. With Spielberg - post Jaws (which I actually love and think is his best movie - an American classic) - we come to expect this, but it just gets drowned in the maple syrup. I like a good heartfelt sci-fi movie, but this was way too much. 3. The E.T. ending. I saw it coming, and hoped that I would be wrong, but, oh, no ... nope, no chance. When I saw the alien finger, I knew that I had watched/invested too much time into it. My son had made the right choice. 4. As others have pointed out, technically, there are some glaring errors regarding physics. See how many you can count. 5. Do people not evolve at all? In the future, won't humans have become much more like robots as it will be a much more efficient - and safer (much reduced chance of disease and accidental deaths) - form of existence? Nope, we will still want to stay in our sacrosanct homo sapiens mode forever. Nah, don't think so.",A.I. Artificial Intelligence
618,xfirerushx,Artificial Intelligence- A True Classic 10 Years Later,9,17 September 2011,"Artificial Intelligence is one of the greatest science fiction films I have ever seen. It is just that good. It is like mixing E.T. with Blade Runner with maybe a little kid movie charm. It deals with a pretty basic concept in science fiction movies. Robots. However, it takes that concept and turns it into a near masterpiece.A.I. is about a machine named David. He is the first of his kind. Here were have a robot that can have emotions. He can feel. He can love. He can have envy. He can have fear. He is human in every way, but everything else makes him seem inhuman. David is played by Haley Joel Osment who is without a doubt, the best child actor ever. Period. He was amazing in The Sixth Sense, but he really steals the show here. Everything from the writing to his great performance makes you care about David from the very beginning. So basically, David is created by a company named Cybertronics whose goal is to advance the technology of Artificial Intelligence. They have finally reach their peak with David. David is given to a couple. They had a son named Martin, but Martin is very ill. At first, the mother disagrees with her husband and his actions of bringing David to their home as she finds no appeal in an attempt of replacing their son Martin. Then the movie goes off from there as you are swept on a visually wonderful, excellently paced, exciting adventure that will pull at your heart strings at every turn. I am being very vague with the plot as I do not want to spoil one bit of it. All the performances in this movie is top notch. Jude Law also gives a great, entertaining performance, but perhaps one of the best characters isn't really real. Who am I speaking of? I am speaking of Teddy. Teddy is a super-toy, one that I wish I had when I was a kid, that has emotions, can think, can talk, and create friendships. He ends up sticking with David throughout his adventure and certain parts of the movie where they get separated just gets a bit emotional. Teddy is David's only real friend in his alone world. But enough of that before I start accidentally spitting spoilers. Bottomline, Teddy is one of the greatest film characters ever! This movie is visually wonderful. They never seem to over-indulge with the CGI. Most of the effects are controlled machines and traditional effects. I love it. The scenery in this movie is not only artistic, but just breathe taking.But what is wrong with this so-called, masterpiece? I have little to complain about, but it is the same thing that may have turned off a few of you out there, but for me it has got to be the ending. The last scenes, while very emotional, drag on a bit and jump-the-shark with a certain twist that I am not going to spoil. To be fair, in hindsight, you should've seen it coming and it really isn't this bad, but I just can't help feel that they were so far in this engrossing adventure that they had no idea how to wrap up all the loose ends. The movie sort of succeeds by the end, but it just gets a bit too weird. It doesn't bother me as much as you would probably think, but it is very forgivable.I cannot recommend this movie enough. If you are a fan of science fiction, watch it. If you are a fan of heart warming movies, watch it. If you just like movies in general, watch it. Artificial Intelligence is one of the best science fiction movies ever and an adventure I plan to go on again with repeated viewings. 10 years later, A.I. is nothing but pure art. It is an amazing film and a classic. It shall stay in my heart forever. I cannot give this anything, but the highest praise. A 10 out of 10.",A.I. Artificial Intelligence

Perhaps the best I've seen since Kubrick's classic work ""A Clockwork Orange"". I can definately feel Kubrick in this film. It is almost as if he was reincarnated and mixed in with Spielberg's genius, which is very apparent in this film. The movie does run long (about 30 minutes longer than it should) and may be a bit too deep if you are looking for a fun night at the movies. The point of this film, be prepared to analyze it and think! Haley Joel Osment is truly a great actor. He is so convincing in his role. Jude Law is mesmerizing as the comical ""love bot"", Gigolo Joe. I definately recommend this film to any Kubrick fan as it may be that last time to see such genius in a motion picture. Spielberg has once again lived up to his name. Thank you for a truly great movie.",A.I. Artificial Intelligence
621,karmela,"for what audience is it, anyway?",1,1 July 2001,"[contains spoilers] you have probably read a lot about this film as 'the last stanley kubrick's project'. well, what you are going to see is not quite that. poor SK, may he rest in peace, probably wanted all the best for this project, and his trademark bitterness combined with brian aldiss' short story would most likely result in a beautiful, bitter tale of human selfishness and moral dilemmas of science. what you see in theater is probably less than a pale shadow of his original concept. my impression is that the only thing SK and steven spielberg shared was the interest for a 'science-gone-awry' scenarios. 'A.I.' is a SS film with all the consequences of this fact (remember 'jurassic park'? remember 'e.t'? so you should know what i'm talking about). you may watch its first part with pleasure (especially given that big budget, ILM, stan winston's creatures and artistry of janusz kaminski's cinematography almost guarantee a great visual experience). the problem is, this film refuses to end when it should, i.e. after david gets stuck in an underwater trap with a carnival wooden blue fairy. alas, the movie continues for another 40 minutes and turns into oversweetened, unbearable futuristic soap opera (ridiculous skinny creatures from the outer space included). i could have understood where this pathetic happy end came from if that would have been a kid's fairy tale from the day one. but in my opinion some of sequences in the movie are deeply disturbing, almost nightmarish! (example? scenes in this circus-like place where human torture defective androids).  rating such a movie a PG-13 is a big misunderstanding. 'A.I.' is too violent for kids and too stupid for adults, so for what kind of audience is this movie, anyway? one thing is certain: this is not for average new york city crowd. it never happened to me before to hear people boo after the movie ended.want my advice? see 'blade runner' instead.",A.I.

A.I. is a 3-act movie that boasts the Spielberg touch of love and intrigue in the 1st act, and the tone abruptly changes to Kubrick's violent and dark 2 act, and by the 3rd act I was thinking the movie should have ended sooner. A.I. may have been almost perfect in the 1st act, but the whole movie would have been more satisfying if it had more coherence in the changing tones. What I did admire about A.I. was its stunning technical effects, from the superior visuals to the futuristic art direction. John Williams has a fantastic score similar to Vangelis' score from Blade Runner. Had the script been worked on some more, A.I. would be one of the new classic sci-fi epics, instead it confuses itself due to the conflict of creative production minds.

I've read many reviews and opinions of this movie and they are all over the place.  Techincally the film is perfect with amazing visual effects and sound.  I was extremely impressed with the photography and editing.  They should definitely be up for an Oscar.    When it comes to story, it's good.  The entire movie's story is perfect until the end however.  After David's two thousand year wait ends and is given the wish he has always wanted from his examiners, the movie loses its iron grip.  Why? Too much was explained and given.  It looks as though Spielberg tried to go for the tearjerking ending with the resurrecting of his ""mother"".  But hey, its still good. The performances are top notch and Haley Joel Osment definitely deserves an Oscar nomination.  For what its worth, its a film definitely worth watching.  Teenagers and young people may find it boring since there is no fast paced action or explosions around every corner However people who like movies that make you think and wonder, this one is for you...

626,Dave-911,What a surprise?!,9,17 January 2003,"Prior to seeing this movie, I expected something quite different.  That is, I expected more of a science fiction movie about robots.  And, actually, after watching the first half, I wasn't sure I wanted to see the rest. Then, I figured out that this isn't a SciFi movie, it's a fantasy adventure, and as I followed the adventure I was drawn in!!  I was so moved by this film that I wept profusely, afterward.  Something that has never happened to me before.  Perhaps having children of my own had something to do with it.Anyway, suffice it to say, I think this movie is well worth the watch.  Just don't expect some SciFi action film.  As another reviewer mentioned, expect what Spielberg does best - play on our heart strings!!I do have to point out, though, that while we are able to ""feel"" for this robot, he isn't a robot!  He is a person acting as a robot.  That is a very different thing.  I don't think we will really know how we will react to a robot, until we have them - as real as they are in this film.",A.I.

627,tehfro,Flawed? Plot Holes? Yes. The best movie of the summer? Certainly...,9,7 July 2001,"Even though there are a few obvious plot holes one can pick out of the story (they should be obvious) and even though there are some flaws (the last 30 minutes to some, although I think to think it's easy to seperate the final act from the rest if you hate it)... certain scenes in this movie are off-the-page brillance.The constrast between the Kubrick and Spielberg moments, in my opinion, doesn't turn the movie into a conjointed mess but rather strengthens each element.  Jude Law and Osmond are amazing, the scene where Gigolo Joe and David meet has some real bizarre magic.  Let's not forget the famous movies Joe homages through his dance steps.Great SFX and this may be John Williams' best score in a long time.There's a few elements that were vastly out of place... especially Chris Rock's voice cameo as a robot during a scene that should have been more shocking, and certainly some areas of the movie aren't as well developed or thought out as they could have been considering how amazing certain scenes are.There are a few plot points that people might not ""get"" so be aware... my friend was confused and missed one of them.  There's definately several different themes running through the films and ironies and to describe them all would be spoiling the film... but rest assured they are there.Despite the flaws, still a great movie and by far the best of the summer (not like there's been much competition).9/10",A.I.

628,Sir Ulrich Von Lichtenstein,An early candidate for best film of the decade.,10,17 July 2001,"""A.I."" is not a film for everyone. Indeed, the mix of Kubrick and Spielberg may be too odd for most people too handle. But it is a stunning, brilliant work of art that will grow in esteem for years to come, and may well turn out to the best film of the decade. It is a complex and multi-layered, intellectual work reminiscent of Kubrick, with the emotion of Spielberg. The performances are uniformly superb. The disappointing box office can be attributed to the public's distaste for films that are complex, and make them think and draw their own conclusions. The public wants films like ""Pearl Harbor"" or ""The Fast and the Furious"" that can be summed up entirely in two minute trailers.

629,ken-243,Quest story takes wrong road,1,29 June 2001,"** WARNING: SPOILERS ** A.I. Artificial Intelligence begins with the promising premise of a little boy robot imbued with human emotions and the need to by loved by its mother. The first act of the movie shows all the Spielberg artistry as David (the robot) begins to bond with a married couple whose real son is comatose in the hospital. Unexpectedly, though, the real (and evil) son recovers and returns to the household. Now there is no need for the surrogate child and after various complications the mother takes David out into the woods to abandon him (similar to Snow White or Hansel and Gretel). Here, the movie takes a disastrous turn from which it never recovers. Having heard his surrogate mother tell the story of Pinocchio, David goes in search of the Blue Fairy to turn him into a real boy so that his mother will love him. But this is a sci-fi movie, not a fairy tale, so the audience knows that David's quest will be in vain from the start. The final acts progress to be darker and darker. Eventually we find ourselves 2000 years into the future. The mother David bonded with is long dead and turned to dust. Space aliens who now inhabit earth are able to grant David only one day with her facsimilie through DNA cloning. The explanation for only one day is completely unsatisfying -- and for David to have waited and searched for 2000 years to find one day of love is a huge disappointment for the audience. And what's most irritating is this story could have been resolved so much more skillfully  just as it was in ""The Wizard of Oz"" or ""Miracle on 34th Street.""  David's quest to be a real boy wasn't what he was really searching for at all  and that is the twist that should have been employed here. He only wanted to be loved by his mother. This movie would have been far more powerful and moving by having the mother have a change of heart (maybe her evil son had a relapsed and died?) and gone out on her own quest in search of David  with the final resolution that they find each other and share their love. A proper denouement would have been to jump ahead 50 years when the mother is old and on her death bed and they find a palatable way for David to expire at the same time. (Remember the old song, ""My Grandfather's Clock""?)  A.I. is a bleak, dark, sad vision of the future. Certainly not for children under 13 and perhaps not even for those under 17. Children who have any fear of parental abandonment might be deeply troubled by this film.",A.I. Artificial Intelligence

Were we really supposed to have heart felt sorrow for this robot.  It's a robot for god's sake!  Whatever feelings it has, no matter how real they seem, are only programmed feelings.  People were saying to me before I saw it that I should bring a box of tissues because I will just cry the whole time.  I'm sorry, I didn't even come close to thinking about crying.  Everything that the robot boy did all through out the movie were programmed feelings and instincts. NOT LEARNED HUMAN FEELINGS!  It was just a stupid robot.  Who cares if it finds love or not.  I certainly don't.  And for you out there that were really touched by this film, are probably the same idiots who hug trees and would save an animals life over a humans.

632,PAULO-TEIXEIRA-1977,A beautifully well done masterpiece,9,28 December 2008,"I don't know how to start talking about this movie. In fact, it is so beautifully conceived and directed hat it becomes a lot difficult for me to follow an oriented and logical way to describe how deeply it touched me.A.I. starts greatly by focusing the very best of human beings. It also touches mankind's biggest enigma with a supreme sense of knowledge, as if Steven Spielberg was the Life and Death God itself. The story opens softly in a time where computers were part of the past and machines are technologically advanced ""beings"". A time of changes, evolutions, discoveries and, best of all, reproductions. An era in which every men and women no longer know loneliness, lack of sex, partnership or even the word NO. It was a time of Artificiality.But when a mother almost looses her child due to a disease, her husband gets her a temporary substitute for the the hole that consumes her during the time her own child is in the hospital: a technologically advanced robot that would be a perfect substitute of her son in every department, except one: the feelings.In summary, Steven Spielberg takes us to a sci-fi fantasy world, where machines are almost as important as humans. A world full of dramas (cold and raw) but beautiful and touching. In fact I will not advance a lot more about this movie, as I'm sure I'd spoil it. However, let me say it is a ""lesson"" to all of us (or at least to all those of us who have a heart). A.I. is masterpiece. A movie that surely can touch everyone's feelings. Curiously, it reminds me of a LucasArts' game (written by Spielberg based on a story by Sean Clark) - The Dig, where it explores the boundaries of the human life, memories and alien life. Whoever played that game in 1995 knows what I'm talking about. Undoubtedly, one of my favorite flicks from Steven Spielberg!",A.I. Artificial Intelligence

It's an adventure, one that fills the mind and whisks you away, which is Spielberg's forte and is precisely why Kubrick's ultimate vision was to have Spielberg direct it! And yes, it is plenty deep and moving on a level Kubrick could achieve sans the bleak tone. The stark, cold Kubrickian universe just wouldn't play right for the warm human element this story requires.

636,sean3240,Wow,9,15 November 2021,"I just love so much of this. It was thoroughly engaging throughout and manages to balance it's heart and humanity with coldness and darkness really beautifully. Lots of great moments have such specific feelings executed so precisely. It's incredible how well the film does at building this world too, which allows it to get into the human story so easily. A lot of the more significant world building doesn't even happen until around an hour in, and surprisingly that works a lot in its favour.The introduction of David was absolutely perfect. I had no idea what this film was about going in (other that AI... duh), so all the different ideas it was presenting makes you think a lot about the direction the story is going to take, and more specifically how you feel about his character. I hated him at first, I thought it was gonna go full-horror-movie with him and he was gonna kill his family. I was then surprised when within 30 minutes I was feeling heartbroken for him, everyone around him seemed to start feeling this way I felt about him at first, and you see that this poor AI just wants to be a real boy. The film handled this all extremely well, while making you ask yourself what it even means to be human.I thought the first 50 mins were perfect and after that there's a dramatic change in the story. It managed to win me back over after around 15 minutes or so but even after watching it all I'm still really confused at the relevance of all the Jude Law stuff. His character was pretty interesting but it just kind of felt like an unrelated subplot that just happened to overlap with the main one for a while. Not much of a complaint though as it wasn't not interesting, it just didn't feel like it fit.Without spoiling anything, the last half hour takes another deeply surprising turn. At first again I was really worried with the direction it was talking but then it became kinda touching, so it won me over once again.It would've been really interesting to see what Stanley Kubrick would've done with this story but I've gotta say, huge props to Stephen Spielberg for really making this his own.",A.I.

Because the Swanton's son, Martin, has been ill for a long time, the bosses of Cybertronics come to a decision to grant them the opportunity to be the very first parents of a child Mecha. Society detest the Mechas and are trying so hard to eradicate them but David's uniqueness makes him special, or one of a kind.Monica rolls the dices when he activates David to start experimenting with affection. The procedure is irreversible and only destruction is the only way out. When David realizes 'consciousness' he asks Monica about death because he knows he will outlive all his loved ones. Monica then introduces to Supertoy that belongs to Martin, named Teddy.Teddy had been shut down ever since Martin went to hospital. Monica explains that Teddy is a toy and this pisses him off. Even machines before David have some emotional intelligence. Even though it is limited since Teddy does not believe that 50 years is a long time.It is when the Swanton's son returns home, rivalries start. Firstly, he asks David to break his own toy wanting to test his mechanical powers. Secondly, he plays with both Teddy and David's 'minds' when he asks the Supertoy to elect his leader. Teddy surprised everyone and asks for their mother to bail him out. This must be the Self- Motivated Reasoning Professor Allen Hobby spoke about. Thirdly, he suggests to Monica to read them a children's book about Pinocchio. David becomes inspired by the story of Pinocchio becoming a real life boy. He also learns that a mythical heroine named The Blue Fairy transformed the wooden marionette into human.Fueled by jealousy, Martin asks his brother to get a locket of Monica's hair illegitimately. David is cast out of the Swanton Family because of a misunderstanding involving him hurting Martin. He goes on to meet Gigolo Joe, a male prostitute Mecha escaping a murder scene to the Flash Fair.David's uniqueness and likeness results in him surviving being 'slaughtered' and together with Teddy and Gigolo Joe they set out to look for The Blue Fairy because David believes that she will turn him into a real boy so he can return to his mother who will accept him unconditionally.David discovers his origins at Cybertronics and runs into a copy of himself. We learn through Professor Allen Hobby that David's image was influenced by Hobby's own son who has deceased. When Hobby goes to gather David's 'mothers' and 'fathers' David tours the headquarters and stumbles across hundreds of his own look alikes who are still undergoing mass productionSo this means he is not one of a kind. He is only a first of a kind. Grief stricken, David commits 'suicide' by diving into the risen sea. Although he knows being immersed into a large body of water won't 'kill' him. Through it all, the 11-year-old David succeeds and finds The Blue Fairy on the theme park that has been submerged by the sea.David exercises his faith and starts praying to The Blue Fairy to make him a real boy for the longest period.Act IV starts when an excavation crew of Advanced Mechas find David and Teddy frozen inside their Amphibilcopter, shut down 2 millenniums later. The Blue Fairy is not real and is just made out of plastic when she breaks down to pieces as David makes contact with her. This must be the worst heartbreaking scene of the movie.The Advanced Mechas learn about David and recreate his former him because he is confused.'This looks like my house but it is different.' - DavidHow carefully planned and original did the story come about because the new Mechas couldn't give him the exact copy of his old house. Even with their much advanced technology. It must make sense that they also have limitations.The Mechas also recreate The Blue Fairy for the young boy and speak through her. We know this because The Blue Fairy isn't real and David is just too young to understand. They then resurrect Monica out of a hair strand Teddy kept in his pouch. They also warn him not to say anything it will result in everything being ruined. By the end of the day David gets his ultimate wish - for Monica to finally love and accept him.The narration by Ben Kingsley stood out the most because his voice talent was soft, encouraging, pleasant and tender. It was a good idea for us to never see things the way David sees them since he has mechanical components. It would ruined the sense of him being a person. David did love his human brother , Martin. As seen on his birthday he got him a present.Teddy was more of a brother than Martin could ever be. He always looked out for him and stuck by him. Maybe because they were the same kind. At dinner he advised him against consuming vegetables fearing that he would break. But he never advised against the gathering of Monica's hair because it was her biological son's request for him to get the locket.",A.I. Artificial Intelligence

639,Aldaron,Thought provoking,8,5 May 2002,"A lot of the reviews I've seen, both here and elsewhere, carp on about the central character of the story - David - not being emotionally engaging. ""How can we feel emotion for it? It's a robot!""Hmm...to misquote Churchill: ""Never, in the history of human cinema, has a point been missed by quite so much, by so many"".The whole point of the film was that David *did* feel emotion - genuine emotion - for his mother. Genuine emotion, you say? Rubbish! He was programmed that way.Hmm..yes. As are we. *That* is the point. We are organic machines, comprised of cells and tissues and fluids, that process information and come out with emotion. David was a mechanical machine, with wires and electrodes and processors, that process information and come out with emotion.What's the difference? That is the question asked by the film. If you were asked to *prove* your emotions for your mother were real, could you? How then, can one insist David's emotions were simply ""programmed"", any more than ours are ""programmed"" by evolution and our neural network?Seems to me an awfully humanocentric viewpoint is being flung about; one kind of similar, in principle, to the bloodthirsty (fluid-thirsty?) mob in the film who were cheering as the droids were torn to pieces, burned and dissolved by acid.I think we need to have a long, hard look at ourselves if we find it so frightening to accept that something *different* to us could maybe, just maybe, feel the same.I give A.I. 7.5/10",A.I.

There is much here that deserve praise, not John Williams uninteresting music though, what happened to this man?  Has he forgotten what wonderful music he used to give us? The good stuff is an excellent performance by Haley Joel Osment, this kid has something going for him; namely talent.  There is also some wonderful production design.  But alas the bad overshadows the good.  For two thirds of the movie we are taken on a wonderful adventure, too bad that David can't tell just what jerks his new family really are.  But, and this is a big but (no pun intended) once the third act starts you are suddenly thinking, what the hell is this shit.  This movie would have been so much better had we had never experienced this god awful third act.  Why not end the movie at the bottom of the ocean?  that was the ending, Steven, thank you and good night. We didn't need that moronic sub-plot of visiting aliens and the search for who man was.  Who is man? an unfulfilled viewer after having to sit through this third act.  And I'm surprised at this because Spielberg for the most part has already proven that he can do it, but not this time.  What was he trying to do?  Make us feel sorry for this kid?  Well, we felt sorry for him, but not because his mother refused to love him but because he couldn't realize that she wasn't worthy of his love, and we realized this very early on.For anyone who reads this, do yourself a favor and walk out two thousand years before it ends, (you'll know what I mean) and you will think much more of this film than if you wait for the credits.

I left the movie theater two hours ago and for the life of me I still can't figure out exactly what it was about this movie that touched me and made the waterworks show up. I haven't cried during a film in a very long time. A.I. was such an incredible piece of work, I'm surprised at the number of negative reviews it has received. I can understand the negativity however, because human beings have a tendency to dislike that which they can't understand. We also have the tendency, unfortunately, to pass things off as brilliance if we don't understand them as well. So, where does that leave us? With our own opinions. I enjoyed this film. I found it to be incredibly well-made and acted. And, as I mentioned before, it touched me somehow. This movie definitely had three distinct parts to it, all of which could have stood on their own. With each segment, I found myself forcing my mind to suspend disbelief more and more.  While I found some things difficult to stomach (especially in the final portion), I still left the theater in awe of everything I had just witnessed.

644,averroes111,"Deceptively complex, full of implications and always sincere, this is Spielberg's finest film.",10,20 August 2001,"""A.I.: Artificial Intelligence"" is one of those films that hang over you like a cloud for days after you've seen them.  I have returned to A.I. in my thoughts several times since seeing it, grappling with it as both a film and as a collection of ideas and feelings. I now believe that A.I. is Spielberg's most interesting film to date, on par with or even exceeding his achievement with ""Schindler's List.""   I'm not at all interested in whether anyone liked it or not, or whether it went down well with their Skittles, M&M's and popcorn and made them feel personally validated on their drive home.  This film truly has ambitions beyond that.There are many images that strike me in this film.  Mother Ocean at the beginning signifying birth, and Mother Ocean eating her young as the cities of the world drown (with the suggestion that she is ready to eliminate her mistakes and usher in a new era); a robot boy's laughter triggering fake laughter in real parents; David murdering a copy of himself;  the permanently frozen expectancy in the face of the ceramic Blue Fairy  and the image on celluloid of an artificial boy wishing an impossible thing of a dead object; The great pageant of mankind obscured and buried under a thousand years of ice; the `playback' of David's warped memory by the evolved mecha as if it were a cinematic experience inside a cinematic experience, or a copy of a copy of a copy losing more fidelity each time (this was especially effective); the look on clone-of-Monica's face as she is jolted outside of her programming by the cute but horrifying pictures drawn by the robot boy.A.I. is fantasy, horror, the cinema, and even Steven Spielberg's psyche itself laid bare.  It is a dialectic touching on the themes of dreams vs. reality, cinema vs. life, existence vs. non-existence, human vs. non-human, mother-love/birth vs. isolation/death, and the `primacy of emotion' vs. `emotion as a construct of multiple parts.'  It is played along emotional, mythic and subconscious lines and not highly conscious and plot-heavy lines. It is supposed to get under your skin.  The sometimes-astounding economy of expression and the resultant emotional/intellectual possibilities make this film a work of art, and not a didactic, literal treatise or a documentary about robots.  It deserves serious consideration on these grounds.It is about the equation of humanity with fantasy.  To be a human in our human condition is to dream.  Dreaming is a constant wellspring.  It is an impetus to act.  By contrast, A.I. also exposes the non-Spielbergian notion that we and our dreams, and our cinema, are nothing but artifice and wishful thinking.  The Blue Fairy looms large and is an indelible image in this vein.  The film explores with minor keys how we could, just as well as David Swinton, be our own worst nightmares  merely `physical' beings with no supernatural soul, no God.  We are a collection of instincts, needs and desires that need not be more than the sum of their parts, so to speak.  The machinery underneath is exposed; the curtain covering the props supporting our myths is lifted.  Our fantasies to the contrary may only be at best approximately real, with the distance between the fantasy and the reality being tragically vast.The non-primacy of emotion is explored when we see cruel sibling rivalry and the impossibility of acting in an inclusive manner toward beings that are ever so slightly not part of our `tribe.'  This is involuntary instinct unfettered by the intellect or the heart.  It is a vexing part of our `nature.'   At the films fever pitch of tear-inducing emotion -- the third and final act -- there are nothing but gears, bioelectronics, computer chips and `modified' clones.  Witness that some of the kindest humans in the film were not human at all.   Artificial emotion seems at least as valid and also as deeply flawed and `made of parts' to the film as real emotion.And yet, despite it all, the amazing achievement is that anyone can read much of what happens to David as `cruel,' and not `necessary,' or `to be expected,' since we are reminded often that he is a machine.  Why is this? Is it the robot boy's human form?  Is it his actions?  Our minds are sent back and forth in the volley of this philosophic ping pong.Furthermore, all of this becomes highly complicated when we ask ourselves: Is it not tragically ironic for David to have allowed a clone of his mother to be created for HIS purposes, as was he in the beginning?  Are the advanced Mecha doing this favor for David out of loving kindness, or out of pity?  Or are they doing it because he is one of their own and, at long last, the mechas have the upper hand?  They seemed to have qualms about re-creating Monica (they were repeatedly trying to give one reason of another why they couldn't re-create her, but it was always well within their powers) but, ultimately, they did it with thoughts toward David, not the human they constructed.These questions and many more continue to haunt me, and they probably will for the rest of my movie-watching life.Wonderfully shot, beautifully acted, masterfully conceived and very effective, I for one think this is the best film of the year, and probably among the most interesting and unforgettable films made in the last 10 years.Many thanks to Steven Spielberg and the late Stanley Kubrick, who left us far too soon.",A.I.

The pace gets slower as the movie progresses and could have many different endings, you can see the Kubrick side and I guess that's something a lot of people don't like. If you're one of those and don't have the brain to understand you should stay away and watch any other piece of crap released these days (and you have a lot of choice this summer).

To it's credit, at least the film admits it's a complete rip off of Pinnochio with constant reference to it, but there is nothing shocking, nor thought provoking in this film. It ambles along at a painfully slow pace, with the occasional show piece thrown in to try to liven up the proceedings. I think the biggest problem is, you never really empathises with any on the characters. I guess the robot boy is supposed to grow on you as the film progresses and he starts to exhibit more human traits, but this doesn't happen. And you end up not particularily caring whether he achieves his dreams of not. There is one moving moment at the end where you finally think he isn't going to achieve his dream, and he doesn't know how to give up, and you guess he'll spend eternity stuck at this one point. This would have made a thought provoking end to the film. Unfortunately, in true Spielberg manner, this would have been too down beat, and we are then treated to a rediculous, and unnecessary fifteen minute ramble. Speilberg seems unable to leave a film open at the end, and the same is true for this. He has to tie up all of the loose ends, and end on a positive note in a kind of ""..so the worlds not such a bad place after all..."" type way. This doesn't really fit with the themes of the film, as generally, when people are persecuted, it all doesn't work out in the end.Not a great film that is ruined by the ending.

650,Dan-Bowes,"Brilliantly Shot, Heavily criticized.",9,25 November 2002,"Did everyone expect too much from this film? The imagination and vision of Stanley Kubrick under the direction of Steven Spielberg, must have caused some to expect a masterpiece, a film that would surpass Blade Runner and set standards for which future science fiction films will be measured.I watched this movie with no expectations, barley knowing what the plot was and thought it was great. I'm generally not a Spielberg fan, so mabye I wasn't expecting as much as some were, but this is one of his best films to date. Every shot is important, expressing the story or mood of the characters to create an atmosphere which helps to carry the plot and is so often left out by other directors. Not much to say about the acting except that it isn't with Haley Joel Osment pulling off the role thanks mostly to Jude Law and Francis O'Connor's supporting roles.  However I think that more characters could have given the film greater depth and added that something extra which it seemed to be missing at times. Reading a lot of other reviews of this film I saw some people thought there were gaps in the plot. I wouldn't agree with this.  The actualy storyline never confused me, in fact it seemed to guide me through the film. Every aspect of the film wasn't fully explored however it never is in a film that is relaying mostly on imagery, for a flawless plot you have to look at films that are structured around the plot i.e. The Godfather. This film was written with imagery in mind and needed an incredibly strong story to measure up to the images we see throughout the film, especially Rouge City, which seems to take the ideas of Ridley Scott to a new level, although the influence is clearly visible. In conclusion, the film may not be as good as some expected, but if it's watched for the imagery and imagination shown I think that most will be suprised and entertained for it's duration.",A.I.

This portion of the film is great in a Kubrick style.  Parts of it are quite disturbing and it also explores the harshness of their world. I would have to say that the last third has some of Spielberg's charm thrown in to it, but not excessively so. This is one of those movies that doesn't have a greatly recognizable climax, and it works. My understanding is that if a movie has great acting and a great ending, then it is a great movie.  A.I. had great acting from all of its ensemble, especially Haley Joel Osment.  A.I. also had a great ending, where it is bitter-sweet, and lets you make ends meet.

652,pete-323,interesting and thought provoking - as Sci-fi should be,10,20 September 2001,"AI is a very good film. I was disappointed to see it as poorly received as it was - splitting both the public and the film's critics alike.The public perceived it as boring and slow and long. I see this as something we can blame on the last couple of decade's films where all Hollywood fair has been quick, snappy films which has no confidence in the viewers attention span, forcing the audience to become used to quicker films.When a film such as A.I comes along that does trust the audience to take an interest and wait for events to unfold, the audience cries ""Boring!"".
I see the film as thought provoking and extremely relevent in today's ever-advancing world of science and technology. Like the Terminator films warned us of giving too much responsibility to learning computers, AI warns us of trying to replace our children with robots who will outlive us, and create another form of racism where mecha's are hated through envy of being able to last, and evolve beyond us. The only way Spielberg could get his message across to us, and prove it at the same time, is by allowing us to care for David (a mesmerising Haley Joel Osment) and share his passion, desire and love to find the Blue Fairy. In doing this, we believe he IS as good as human (emotionally), even though we know he is not. We feel and support his determination, loss, desire and fear when he does - even though he is an A.I. Some have criticised the film for being too melodramatic. I thought so too, but after seeing a second time (once in America on its release, 2nd in previews in UK) I found it less manipulative, and more a reflection of David's intense emotions.Spielberg's direction has reached a different level; parallel with Schindlers, but from a different angle. I dont think we'll see the likes of this kind of direction from him again, because of Stanley Kubrick's creative involvement in the project, in giving him 1000-odd drawings and storyboards and sketches, after his death. It's unique.All in all - a super film, with brains, and respect for the audience.A rare quantity these days.",A.I. Artificial Intelligence

There were a few noteably problems:First, the flesh fair..........just not necessary, and pretty much lame. They could've done this scene in three minutes, instead they sort of dwelled on it for awhile.Second, of course, the aliens.  Firstly, I don't like the idea at all. Secondly, at least make them look like some sort of being instead of being way to CGI.  The only justification I can think of for their presence is that how else could you set up that emotional one day meeting at the end?Overall, I recommend this movie, especially to those who are very close to your moms.

I think I need to see the film 2 or 3 more times before I get a lasting opinion as to these things...however, I can review the movie based on its surface.Overall, this is a very good film.  The storyline is understandable yet still complex.  The imagery is one of wonder and beauty.  The acting (as usual in a Spielberg) is excellent.  Haley Joel Osment is perhaps one of the best actors out there today.  The music is subtle and complementary.  Some of the scenes are almost jaw-dropping in their power or beauty.  This film has real potential for brilliance.However, I don't think it made it, and I don't think it ever will. One reason is that I'm not really sure what the vision was here.  Kubrick and Spielberg have two clashing directing styles...and I see many elements of both in this film...to the point where it actually impedes the movie.  With 2001, there was one vision...that of Kubrick's...and it is masterfully shone.  We may interpret what the movie showed in numerous ways, but the movie was also telling us what to interpret.  That is 2001's brilliance.  AI didn't seem to grasp what was to be interpreted...machinery?  Human extinction?  Human feelings?  The difference between humans and machines?  Add to that the ending, which I thought was completely unnecessary (and completely Spielberg, obviously). The ending does nothing to promote the questions I believe were intended (a major difference between this movie and 2001).  To me it was shown to make the audience weep...and to get a good feeling out of a somewhat dark film...something I call ""Spielberg sap.""I also think that AI was attempting to say something as true...to answer a question.  This is especially seen at the end of the film.  The problem is you can't answer a vague question very well.  And that is the major problem of the movie.The message it brings may be fuzzy, but there are several aspects of this film that shine.  The performances of Osment and Jude Law were simply brilliant.  William Hurt and Frances O'Connor give solid supporting performances.  The special effects were dazzling and yet still appropriate. For as long a movie as it was...it was always entertaining.AI succeeds at the basic function of movies...to entertain.

He had a Gene Kelly quality, when he moved and danced about. His dialogue was quite clever and he seemed to be an unlikely partner for the young android. The point to pay attention to when watching this movie is the bear. A lot of my friends felt the bear was the coolest and the most disturbing toy you could give a young child. He was a good addition to the movie. I really enjoyed the ending of the movie, alien spaceships that are the shapes of cubes who break apart when they land and oceans that are blocks of ice, was astounding. It was almost depressing seeing what could become of our world and the human race hundreds of thousands or millions of years in the future but still - awe inspiring.

It may be that the ending was too disjointed with what came before. The CGI was done well, and the acting was above average. The story will make you think of our prejudices and why our fears seem to project those prejudices. So that aspect of the story was clear, and made relevant to society today. My approach to movie watching is how does it keep me interested. With this movie, I was interested until after he reached the lab in old NY. It just went downhill it seemed. I was waiting for the movie to end. I can't explain it, nor do I have an explanation as to how the ending could have been better. Maybe if they showed more of a connection to the 'racial' prejudice that was twined into the first part of the story, weather it be a resolution to the problem, or a reminder that maybe it will always be there. The ending just lost me in that I understood it, but just lost interest in it.",A.I. Artificial Intelligence
662,s_daad,Anyone here read Frankenstein?,1,3 September 2010,"AI is a monstrosity. It is extremely disturbing. More than the contents, it is the very fact that the film was made that disturbs. To me it is clearly a retelling of Mary Shelley's Frankenstein, yet of all the comments and reviews I've come across about this film I haven't heard ""Frankenstein"" once. They don't recognise it because it's poured over with sugar – Spielbergian sugar. The monster is so deeply buried in the sugar that people end up commenting on the surface texture of the candy, or just the wrapping. OK, who let a sugar coated monster into society? It's not just the film-makers, because they knew very little about it. It's the whole lot of us – the audience, the professional reviewers, the education system that stifles our thinking, the rampant commercialism that doesn't allow us to see beyond our next incoming dollar, all of that is responsible. And therefore AI is a monstrosity that reflects our own selves. That's why it's so more disturbing. Those who recognise it are horrified. Just read through the comments posted here and you'll see what I mean. People are saying that they were bored, but their passionate comments sounds more like anger to me. They wish that they never saw the film, and I felt the same way too. I felt dirty, used, and very angry. More so because I had to see it with my kids. I just hope they forget the experience quickly enough.We have a scientist who wants to make a robot who can love. One of his colleagues correctly points out that love only works both ways, and if the scientist can't love his circuitry back then he can't have a loving robot in the first place. To this the scientist answers back, ""Didn't God create Adam to love him in the first place?"" OK, so he's playing God. No, in fact it's worse. He wants to go one better than God, because God loved Adam back, but the scientist doesn't feel the need to love his machine at all. The first is called Satanic megalomania. The second is plain lunacy. It appears that the makers of the film adhere to the second school. So we are pitched into a story where we are supposed to believe that a mother can love her adopted robot child. But the script soon discovers that this isn't possible, so we are left with an abandoned robot in a hostile world, crying out incessantly that he want to be real and wants to be loved. At this point the makers of the film have forgotten the original question, ""Can you love a robot back?"" It's now all about, can the robot child get what he wants, a loving mother. It can't be done for real, so let's get in the super-sophisticated alien technology to make him a clone mother for a day. In a nutshell, the ultimate freak-show.If you can't love the robot back, then what you have on your hands is the worst monstrosity. Victor Frankenstein realised that in a flash, as soon as he saw the monster twitch into life in front of him. I think Stanley Kubrick saw it too, and that's why he abandoned the film mid-way. But Spielberg doesn't notice anything amiss. I think Spielberg is the real robot child in this whole saga. He is a creation of high tech and youth pandering society. He is all childish optimism, and buoyed by commercial success, he has stayed that way. He believes that there is nothing that technology cannot solve, and if not now then ""bring in the aliens to do the job"". So when Kubrick's abandoned project fell into his lap, he said, Oh, all this needs is some alien-induced sugar. When a little doesn't work he puts in a lot. What we are left with is utterly creepy and disgusting. To me, it's Spielberg who is crying out, ""I want my Mommy!"" And it is we who are flying in horror, knowing that we cannot love this inhuman thing, and whose only hope for happiness is to have a clone Mommy for a day, and then dream of her forever after. And then again, it's not all Spielberg's fault. Who encouraged Spielberg in the first place? Where is the intelligence of Mary Shelley in this day and age? What is technology doing to us all? People don't like this film because it raises too many questions about what we are becoming. How can such a film me made on a $90M budget? How can it get a 72% rating on Rotten Tomatoes? Why does nobody cry ""Frankenstein!""? How can the scientist at the centre claim serenely that he wants to go one better than God, and yet fail to elicit any comment from viewers?  Disturbing indeed!",A.I. Artificial Intelligence

And the film doesn't know which theme to adapt. Haley Joel Osment- fresh off the success of The Sixth Sense is quite good as the main lead who happens to be a robot and the visuals are exciting.

664,Venom-5,One of the most depressing films ever.,3,4 July 2001,"(Some Spoilers) I saw this movie on Monday (July 2) and i regret it.  The movie is 2 1/2 hours long but feels more like three for it is one of the most depressing movies I've ever seen, it is almost completely joyless and is filled with one scene of emotional pain and scaring after another.  The beginning of the movie is way too slow to be enjoyed.  This movie is definitely not for kids.
In this nightmare, David is ""adopted"" by one of the employees of thecorporation who created him and by his wife.  He, Henry Swinton (Sam Robards) and his wife, Monica Swinton (Frances O'Connor II) have a biological son; Martin Swinton (Jake Thomas), who is in a coma.
The story of Pinocchio is heavily featured in this movie and likePinocchio, David wants to be a real little boy so his mommy will accept and love him. There are some rough waters to cross when Henry brings David home to meet Monica and she is upset at the thought of David being brought into their home as some substitute for their comatose dying child.  But eventually her need for mothering wins out and she activates the program within David that will cause him to feel emotion, to feel love, and to bond to Monica as deeply and powerfully as any child could to his mom -- for the rest of his life. Thus David becomes the first robot to feel on an emotional level, the other robots in the film feel only on a physical level.There is no turning back this love programming.  If his ""parents""should ever wish to return him no one else could adopt him, he will bedestroyed. Eventually their flesh child makes a recovery and the little brat comeshome.  Like the Serpent in the Garden of Eden, Martin tempts David intotaking an action which results in him appearing dangerous. His mothershrugs the event off and trusts him but the father is very waryand distrustful of him. But appearances are misleading and unlike theevil human child, David had no evil intentions in his heart -- heart?Neuro emotichip?  Whatever, there was no evil within him.
Shortly thereafter another event occurs in which David innocently putsMartin's life in danger. So Henry decides that David must go tothe dumpster like an old broken toy and instead of delivering him to his doom he lays the burden on his wife who has bonded with this child created not of nature but of man.So she drives him to where he was created so he could be destroyed, buton the way to his destruction Monica has a change of heart and releases him into the woods like one would a pet who has become a burden.  Accompanying him is a teddy bear robo toy by the name of Teddy (Jack Angel 1st) the cutest thing with fake fur you'll ever see. So there begins David's quest to find the Blue Fairy of Pinocchio so she will turn him into a real boy so his mom will let him back into his home and will love him.  LOVE him; as he does her.  A deep undying, unchanging love.
David soon meets up with Gigolo Joe (Jude Law), one of the mostentertaining characters in this film. Gigolo Joe is a...well he's a love machine. He is funny without trying to be.  He is flashy, he is roguish, he is ridiculous. I love this character and the way Jude Law played him.
Joe and David end up at a ""Flesh Fair"", where they (along with others) are about to be viciously slaughtered by robot hating humans.  Unfortunately for David, they escape and David resumes his quest for the Blue Fairy whom he hopes will make his Pinocchio inspired dream come true.
The acting is terrific, from the stars of the film to the actors in thesmaller roles. The furniture, the buildings, the vehicles are all cool and futuristic looking without looking so fantastic as to not be a realistic vision of the near future.  I could easily see its Rouge City being a futuristic Las Vegas. I left the theater feeling depressed and really bummed out.  For thismovie is dark for the sake of being dark. It has no message exceptmaybe that one should not create beings who love without loving them in the process.  Well i admit that is a pretty big message but at the same time it is negated because there is nothing in this movie which says that life is worth living, that love is worth giving, that humanity is worth saving.",A.I.

Would we be forced to watch a sappy Spielberg-esque interpretation of what Kubrick would have ""wanted""? I was hoping this wouldn't be the case.And it wasn't.This was an amazing film. It was beautiful, it was emotional, it was heart-wrenching, and it was truly intriguging. an hour after watching this film, my stomach still has butterflies, and tears still linger in my eyes.For as annoying I have considered Haley Joel Osment in previous films, in A.I., this young man deserves the Oscar for best actor. He gives a gifted and astounding performance in this film, and should be given accolades of the highest order in Hollywood.The film was a perfect amalgam of Kubrick intelligence and dark morals, yet filled with the wonderment and visual astonishment that can only be brought to celluloid by Spielberg. The visual effects were stunning.Jude Law as ""Joe"" was also excellent in his role as ""Joe"". I will not spoil anything in this movie, as I prefer to see films unspoiled, but I have not seen a performance of this caliber from him yet. I was keenly impressed.Overall, I recommend this film to adults who enjoy sci-fi, but as well as adults who really love drama. Even if your better half doesn't want to go see a ""robot movie"" drag them kicking and screaming. They will love it. I would, however, recommend that you do not bring children under the age of 12 to see this movie.

Without love, we are just a bunch of clones. The capacity to give and receive love makes us truly individual.It's a shame this was marketed as a mainstream film. Had it been marketed through independent film circles, I feel the hailstorm of negative reactions would've been much less.

Kubrick was diverted to ""Eyes Wide Shut"" and passed away before being able to direct this film.Steven Spielberg, a good friend of Kubrick's, was impressed by Kubrick's story and decided to direct A.I. in Kubrick's honor.  What results is a successful collaboration between Spielberg and Kubrick. 
In fact, Spielberg manages to effectively distance himself from himself in this film.  I saw a lot of Kubrick elements in the film and very little of Spielberg.  It's almost as if Spielberg and Kubrick had a psychic connection from beyond the grave!A.I. is multilayered and intensely philosophical ... just like a Kubrick film.  A.I. has an ambiguous ending ... just like a Kubrick film.  A.I. gives you chills while watching it ... just like a Kubrick film.  A.I. has hardly any dialog and uses imagery to convey its story ... just like a Kubrick film.  A.I. explores the dark side of human nature ... just like a Kubrick film.  A.I. presents a credible future ... just like a Kubrick film. A.I. even has one scene in a bathroom and several shots down long hallways... just like a Kubrick film.The only Spielberg elements here are the lavish sets, excellent special effects, the superb score by John Williams, and the narrations from Ben Kingsley.  (The narrations from Ben Kingsley should have been left out. They detract from the film a bit.)The actors each do an excellent job.  Haley Joel Osment is outstanding as David!  (Notice how he doesn't even blink once during the movie!)  Jude Law and Francis O'Connor give stunning performances as well!  I recommend Haley Joel Osment for Best Actor of 2001 and at least supporting nominations for Jude Law and Francis O'Connor.  Also worthy of note are Sam Robards (as Henry Swinton), William Hurt (as Professor Hobby), and Jake Thomas (who makes a good transition from Disney's ""Lizzie McGuire"" to the big screen as ""Martin Swinton"").If you do see this movie, plan to be taken on a ride through several philosophical concepts: the future, love, intelligence, parenting, our fear of intelligent robots, etc.  This film will arouse many questions but will allow you to draw your own conclusions.See it for the acting.  The acting is dramatic and very visual.  Since there's hardly any dialog, pay attention to their actor's movements and facial expressions.  They tell everything!In the very least, at least see it to enjoy the great special effects: 1. New York City under water (You've got to see this, its amazing!). 2. The scene where they are repairing David.  (His chest is open.) 3. The opening of the face of the female robot at the beginning.  (This is pulled off so flawlessly!) 4. Rugue City.

671,kaworu-3,Indescribable,10,30 June 2001,"I can honestly say this about ""A.I."" - I have never seen any other film that was remotely like it before.  The trailers made it look like a ""DARYL"" rehash - but the film itself is just about anything but that.Much criticism has been made about Speilburg softening blows that Kubrick would have brutally left intact.  I consider that to be a plus, seeing as the final product ended up being one of the most heartwrenchingly sad films ever made to begin with.  However, despite many Speilburg touches, this film still has Kubrick written all over it (with the sterile surroundings and the extremely dark tones).  Even the final fifteen minutes (which is pure Speilburg) is loaded with Kubrickian overtones.Haley Joel Osmond gives a performance that is both creepily artificial and painfully sincere, once again proving himself to be the best child actor ever to enter the world of American filmmaking.Jude Law looks a lot like Alex from ""Clockwork Orange"" (take away the eyebrow, and they would look almost exactly alike), but the similarities end there.  He is creepily artificial as well, yet gets to show a few moments of artificial humanity that hit the nail on the head.If I were to make a complaint about this movie, it would be the fact that it has more than one ending.  But that's a minor quibble.  ""A.I."" is a science fiction masterpiece that raises more questions than it answers - guaranteed to frustrate many viewers, yet at the same time likely to remembered as one of the most intelligent and provocative films ever made.

673,TheFilmGuru,"""That Steven Spielberg sure ain't no philosopher!""",9,8 July 2001,"Well, at least not of the postmodern ilk, to be sure. My uncontainable enthusiasm for Spielberg's philosophical essay - and unabashed homage to cineast-POET, Stanley Kubrick - obliged me to respond briefly to that rather unkind, certainly un-generous, critical remark from the middle-aged couples in the lobby. That is to say, I offered the following quick summation :""A filmic PARABLE about how ethical responsibility for our emotions - 'what makes us HUMAN', being the humanist given - lies within ourselves and not with the objects of said emotions."" Which comment was probably no less mystifying. Chief among all HUMAN emotions being, in this case, ""LOVE"" !Possible spoiler !The story, of how a programming engineer (himself doing his own ""work of mourning"" over the loss of his mortal son) has so reduced the mechanical's ""essence"" (that which WILL ""precede"" and define ever-young David's immortal ""existence"" !) to its immutable desire to love and be loved in return, is a remarkable one ! That this fable is employed to  underscore a certain solipsistic subjective wisdom (sans all the ideological 'realism' of our Age of Cynical Reason) is a POETIC expression; and, hopefully, a provocative exploratory challenge to our thinking.The diegesis of this 'modern-day fairy tale' is here based on the Rousseauean humanist (SciFi) notion that our human sentience will always be envied by the 'soul-less' merely animate. The film's truth or moral is, however, that,""Love has nothing to do with anyone else !"" And it has here been conjoined to the touching tragic story of ""David,"" the robo-child hero of innocence, our latest kind of ""super-toy.""
Doing what may very well be the upmost possible, within the sequential linear-narrative parameters of the media of cinema, this artistic portrayal of a timeless edifying parable, even more a spiritual-ethical near-futuristic science 'faction', IS a tragic statement. For ""David,"" the cynical 'fact' remains that:""It doesn't matter how much YOU love, but how much you ARE loved!""For most of Spielberg's post-modern/post-humanist audiences, too.

Kubrick, who was courting this story since 1969, was wise to make Eyes Wide Shut before instead of this ludicrous hodge-podge of Pinocchio, Wizard of Oz and Close Encounters.  Osment proves that he can be an astonishing actor despite the low caliber material given to him (see Pay it Forward - rather, DON'T see Pay it Forward).  His performance as the little robot that wants to be a real boy stands out like a rose growing atop a dump heap.  On the other hand, Jude Law's undeveloped Gigolo Joe is a waste.  Cutting out his character and a never explored subplot would shave 20 minutes off this never-ending debacle.  The last half-hour is most offensive.  Let me offer this equation:  Spielberg + Ferris wheel = bad sign (see 1941 - rather, DON'T see 1941).  I can't help but think that Kubrick might have filmed this ending, looked at it and scrapped it.  The Master of the Retake would have then called Osment back for an additional five years while he filmed another.  As it stands, it frustrates and infuriates.  It's almost as if Spielberg couldn't come up with an acceptable conclusion so he slapped on the ending to Close Encounters.  Utterly insulting.

As a testimate to the film power, it kept me up half the night thinking about it, and even now, several days on, I still find myself playing certain scenes over and over in my head. Of course, AI is a very moving film, but it's also just as disturbing in some places - a characteristic that is shared by many of Spielberg's latest films (i.e. Schlinder's List, Saving Private Ryan). It's not surprising this film didn't generate too much excitement at the box office, AI is an intelligent, cerebral film, and definitely not one for the mindless masses.Under the mastery direction of Steven Spielberg, Haley Joel Osment was allowed to show off his acting skills - Jude Law too - but it's the special effects that has to take center stage in this film. Not taking anything away from Lord of the Rings, but AI should have won the best visual effects Oscar. Everything was just so real. The imagination(s) behind this film is truly awesome.It also occurred to me that AI would be the last film ever to feature Stanley Kubricks name among the titles.

I have to say I really enjoyed it. But I think the biggest problem is people's pre-conceived ideas. Those who like Kubriks films will consider ""Ai"" too wishy washy and emotional. Those who like Spielbergs work will consider it too dark, slow and a bit non-sensical. But you really have to view this film from a totally neutral and un-biased position and appreciate it on its own merits. Even if it wasn't common knowledge, you would be able to tell this is the work of two radically different directors melded into one image. It constantly jumps from extreme sentiment and obvious emotion, to dark, depressing views of humanity, and mixes in a heavy dose of philosophical ""what are we all about"" commentry. I have to admit it brought a few tears to my eyes, and I defy anyone with normal emotions to remain dry-eyed throughout, and its one of those films you'll talk and argue about in the bar afterwards. I think critics of the film have been overly harsh and too quick to judge. Don't expect a serious,deep, ""2001"" style film, or a flashy, easy on the eyes(and brain) ""ET"" style film. This is new territory for both directors, and is a cocktail of styles and ideas that, because of the history and circumstances of its making, may never occur again.

The emotional impact of the movie will probably take you by surprise, and this may have been the reason that Kubrick entrusted Spielberg with the directing duties. However, Steven Spielberg doesn't resort to cheap sentimentality to involve you emotionally.I would expect Stanley Kubrick to be very proud of the A.I.

I had worried that Spielberg was going to turn Kubrick's vision into some kid's movie with corny lines. Thank god, there was actually only a handful of them in the whole movie. This was one of those films where I felt like I was transported into another dimension, where I felt fully submerged in the story and the world it existed in. It was very beautiful.Janusz Kaninski is an excellent cinematographer as always. His love for light has produced some absolutely heavenly scenes filled with haze and grain that he is so good at using to enhance the beauty of film. Sometimes I forget how much richer and alive things look when shot on film as opposed to digital video...The story was very interesting. It was sometimes disturbing, and I really liked how very different the second half is from the first. Jude Law was a very convincing robot, and Haley Joe Osment was incredibly endearing. He used to annoy me, but his fantastic transition from robot to real boy (in demeanor) verily changed my mind about him.It did get a little slow during the beginning of the last third of the film (it's a 2 and a half hour film), and sometimes I would wonder if the film was about to end. In a way, I thought this would have been cool because it really would have left the audience feeling weirded out and unfulfilled, hehe. But, the strange twist at the end. Rather, the great leap at the end was very interesting and very cool. I was quite touched by the plot, being a sci fi fan. The questions of robots and artificial intelligence, and a world that produces advanced versions of this was a great setting to introduce ethical issues. This film also gives this strange sense of being a mix of a hundred other stories. There were times I felt I was watching ""E.T."", whether from the constant moon theme, or the John Williams music. Besides the obvious, Pinnochio, I also caught strange reminders of ""Bladerunner"", ""The Nightmare Before Christmas"", and ""TRON"" believe it or not!!! Ask anyone whose seen this flick and they will probably relate to you at least three other films other than the ones I just mentioned that they were reminded of by this film.If you have the patience to overlook the slow part, then watch this movie. The strange plot, moral issues, and beautiful cinematography will sweep you away into a different world, and you leave the theater either feeling good, depressed, or at least a little dazed.

It felt disjointed, overly sentimental, and lacked what I hoped it would have. But, after walking out, I thought about it. I thought about each scene, what it could of meant, and what was trying to be said. I came to the conclusion that I had no idea, and that in order for me to know, I had to see the movie again. So I did. And here's what I thought: I've never been so enchanted, touched, moved, held spellbound,or engrossed in any movie, I possibly have ever seen. Why the difference? Because ""A.I."" is too complicated of a movie to understand if you only see it once. Period.In my opinion this is a masterpiece, the same way Kubrick's ""2001"" is a masterpiece. ""2001"" opened to not so grand reviews (so did ""A.I."") and it didn't do very good business (as of now, neither has ""A.I."") But, today, one cannot mention great sci-fi movies without mentioning ""2001"". I suspect the same fate will go to ""A.I."" Everything made infinite more sense the second time around, and the ending that so many have put into question works on every level.
I say this for those who felt confused coming out of this film. See it again; all your questions will be answered.As far as the film goes, Haley Joel Osment does it again with a performance for the record-books. I wouldn't be surprised to see a second Academy nom in his future, and possibly a statuette. The supporting characters are just as incredible, with Jude Law taking the cake as the most fun to watch. He is flawless as usual. Another bright spot comes in the form of Teddy, the super-toy friend of David, the boy mecha. While Teddy isn't real, you can't help but sympathize with him, and in the end, grow to understand his wisdom that even exceeds humans. Don't listen to skeptics. Judge for yourself. They don't make movies like this anymore. And they probably won't after this one, simply because in money-driven Hollywood, sentimental sci-fi movies that don't make a profit are a dying breed.All I have to say in the end is see this movie again for a full understanding.

707,bacoby13,Don't judge a movie by its ending.,10,5 July 2001,"Going into this movie, I had heard all the hype, seen all the TV spots, but I not read any reviews. Thankfully so. If I had, I might of turned away. But I took the movie for what it was worth. It was a deep, complex, engrossing and all in all beautiful re-telling of Pinocchio, with Kubrickian coldness and Spielbergian warmth. The blending of these two talents creates a wildly uneven atmosphere, but one that we can see in society today, and one that is just a ball to watch. Each act of the movie has a different feel. The first being warm, the second, cold and depressing, while the third offers some thoughtful questions on our own existence. The seperation of these acts is so important, because each offers new insight, and new understanding, and the over all feeling of each makes the journey so much more poignant, because it is through the eyes of David, the boy robot so marvelously portrayed by Haley Joel Osment. We feel what he feels, and we see what he sees, and it make the end all the more worth it. While, at first glance, one make think that the last 20 minutes of this movie were over long and a waste, one must look at the source of this movie, Stanley Kubrick. He himself wanted the very ending Spielberg chose. So for all those Kubrick purists, this movie was all Kubrick. The ending itself is so beautiful, that one must be patient to understand its deeper meanings. In my opinion, I found the ending to be so enchanting and wonderful. Patience will help you get through it. Jude Law is once again excellent as Gigolo Joe, the guide on Davids journey. His one dimensional approach as a ""love mecha"" is just another example of the cold environment created where robots, like Joe, only know one thing: How to have sex with woman, how to get woman, and where to find woman, basically. Frances O'Connor pulls out an emotional performance as David's ""mother"" of sorts. She portrays so much confused emotion, that its hard not to cry at her lowest times. With so many nods to the great one himself, Stanley Kubrick, Steven Spielberg directs this movie with so much heart and in so much reverence to Kubrick. Its obvious the apprentice has made the master proud. Don't write off this movie because of its odd approach and hard to sit through ending. After you sit and think about the ending, all will make sense. Its one to ponder, to talk about, to just look at in awe. Great filmmaking is hard to come by these days, but Spielberg proves that even he hasn't lost his touch. Don't miss A.I., or you'll regret it, for it will become a classic years to come.

Artificial Intelligence is a fairy tale story about a robotic boy and his desire to find his place in the world. The late Stanley Kubrick was the father of the A.I. project for over 20 years. I think that the Speilberg/Kubrick joint effort was worth the wait. A.I. is set in a time when the polar ice caps have melted and natural resources are limited. Parents who want to have children, must get a license from the government before they can conceive. To deal with the depression that goes along with this law, Cybertronics has created David. David is the first mecha (mecahnical person) who is actualy programed to love. David is sent to live with the Swinton's, who's own son is frozen and in a coma. David immediately looks to Monica Swinton as a mother and bonds with her. All seems to be going well for David until the Swinton's son recovers and comes home to live with them. Through a series of accidents and other events David is forced to leave the Swinton's, he can only return if he is a ""real boy.""

AI does something that rights a wrong from a long time ago.  The best way for me to explain this is with a simple idea:  Think of ""AI"" as though it were Kubrick's ""2001 A Space Oddesey"" only with ""AI"" the plot and resolution actually go together and make sense.  From A Cinamatographic viewpoint, these movies are quite similar.  In fact ""AI"" is better from the cinematography viewpoint, and utilizes the latest in CGI and digitized worldry.

711,LtCol_Kilgore,"Flawed, yet haunting experience- overall very good",8,14 April 2002,"`A.I.' is a flawed masterpiece, a title often placed on the wrong films. `Blade Runner' is a similar film that deserves the moniker, as well as the former. Both have haunting and at times devastating effects, yet have noticeable faults that can not be excused. Of course, imperfection was inevitable with this film being a Kubrick/Spielberg collaboration of sorts. Kubrick influenced the film greatly, as it was to be perhaps his final production. Unfortunately, the cinematic genius died before he could produce much, and Spielberg took over. The two have completely different styles. Spielberg is an audience pleaser and Kubrick is pessimistic. As a result, there is a noticeable mixing of styles. The film at times is relentlessly depressing and trite at others. However, these are not the film's big flaws; I found the collision of Spielberg and Kubrick to result in a lack of political and social messages. For a film with an ambitious plot like this, that is inexcusable.Haley Joel Osment, once more seeming like he is 7 years old as opposed to 13, plays David. David looks identical to a human boy and behaves mostly like one, too. However, he is a `mecha,' or an android. The time is in the future, and polar ice caps have melted, devastating cities such as New York. As an attempt to solve population and labor crises, androids are developed. However, David is of a revolutionary type of android. His purpose is to act as a pet of sorts. He is a mechanical son, designed to genuinely love his owner(s). Upon creation by the hopeful Dr. Hobby, David is adopted by the Swinton family of Maria, Henry, and their son Martin, who is recovering from a near lethal illness. David is programmed to love Maria, and he loves her more than anything else in his world, but he inadvertently wreaks martial havoc amongst the Swintons and is forced to flee. Accompanied only by the `supertoy' teddy bear Teddy, David wanders a strange world only to find a group of androids fleeing for their lives. It is here that he meets Gigolo Joe, a suave android prostitute who accompanies David everywhere. The two then search the hostile world in order to help David achieve his dreams of becoming a real boy so that he can return to Maria and be loved.
Both characteristics of the two aforementioned directors are visible. Kubrick's perpetually negative, cynical and perhaps even nihilistic views are captured in multiple images. Throughout Kubrick's films, stunning images can be found, and `A.I.' is deeply reminiscent of those visuals. For instance, shots of a bridges with massive stone statues used for support, an underwater Coney Island, blanketed by encroaching seaweed, and Rouge City, a smorgasbord of brilliant electric lights and skyscraping nightclubs, enrapture the viewer. Another extremely haunting shot sequence is the view of a nearly submerged New York City, with only a handful of skyscrapers protruding from the murky depths, including the hand of the Statue of Liberty. The visual portrayal of Earth in its twilight, in a state of melancholy, left me unsettled and saddened. Hours after the film, `A.I.'s' content still remained in my mind, engraved. Unfortunately, Spielberg sacrifices Kubrick's trademark scathing social messages for his own trademark audience pleasing sentimentality. For a film with a plot featuring a near-apocalypse, mass android reproduction, and the like, there is a sad absence of any socially relevant subplots, which always elevated Kubrick's films such as `A Clockwork Orange,' `2001: A Space Odyssey,' and `Dr. Strangelove' to classics. Subplots that one would think to be included yet are only hinted at are racial and ethnic bigotry, the morality of creating artificial life, and the metaphysics of being alive. Instead of forcing the viewers to question their own existence and think, Spielberg trades that uncomfortable material to his own skilled area- emotional power. David's desperate search for love brings the viewer to the film's denouement, a ludicrously contrived, yet strangely affecting trip through miles of ice and visitations with other `characters.' The film ends on such an odd note, hopelessly depressing yet somehow poignant at the same time, that final shot was etched in my mind throughout the day and the next. I turned the VCR off, moved and haunted by the film.Of course, the film is flawed as mentioned earlier. There are multiple faults with `A.I.,' just one being the relationship between David and Gigolo Joe. The two are in constant company with each other, having met randomly, yet their relationship clicks too quickly and is never truly developed. The script fails to bind the characters together, leaving an awkward void where interaction should be. Also, Haley Joel Osment turns in a mostly good and at times superb performance, yet he once more lapses into his tendency to whisper emotional lines as if that trite behavior will wrench tears from the audience. This habit is extremely obnoxious and manipulative; any viewer touched by it should be banned from films forever. Aside from this, a lot of focus on the film has revolved around the abundance of underdeveloped subplots. While this is the case, I never felt this facet of the film to be damaging. These include a crime associated with Gigolo Joe, Dr. Hobby's obsession with David, and a few other threads that if more developed, would have served little use other than to further prolong the film. Instead, the should-have-been-subplots that I mentioned earlier were of a greater necessity to the film.No matter how visible the scars of fault are in `A.I.,' the sheer emotional effect of the film overwhelms them. The viewer will nevertheless be stirred by this film, no matter how imperfect it is. Many loathe this wonderful film for a variety of rationales; I am a supporter. No film of 2001 has moved me as much as this, not even `In the Bedroom,' yet I am not quite sure if I am ready to declare `A.I.' the best film of the year. It may be. Surely, it is one of them.",A.I.

Although it has stunning visual effects, which will undoubtedly recieve an oscar, except for the first half, which is superb, the movie doesn't seem to resemble anything that is Kubrick.

I left the theater not knowing what to think of it: whether to condemn the last scenes as contrived, Hollywood, superfluous, sappy. I was almost positive that they had ruined the movie for me. However, subjectively, Spielberg left in his artistry the right amount of evidentiary textual elements in the last scenes to prompt more in depth thought about the film itself. Assure yourself, as the credits roll across the screen: the film is NOT an allegory for Pinnochio. To claim such suggests that you did not watch the movie! The use of Pinnochio serves two purposes: to provide common ground with the audience, and to satire the notion of humanity as benevolent. It is the aspiration of all creation to become its creator. In this attempt, creation will forgo all benevolence, and create something in its own likeness which will aspire to be it. However, imperfection reciprocates. Both sides of human nature are present: the crass, base primality of destruction and sexual eroticism(read: Gigolo Joe and Flesh Fair) and the ability for the created to love its creator, and to love in general(read: David wishing to be a BOY, but his only role model for boyhood is Martin, a perverse, unhappy boy whose attitude towards David is competitively, haughtily condescending at best. It makes the revival of his marred, half-dead corpus seem all the more reprehensible.) Thus it can be seen, the two main artificially intelligent characters in this movie are manifestations of both sides of human nature, even though neither being is wholly perfect or wholly imperfect(Gigolo Joe is capable of benevolence, just as David is capable of hatred and destruction). Spielburg also suggests that the capacity for love inspires creation. This optimism resides in David's attempt to fulfill his own dream of being a ""real boy."" The abstraction remains in his mind, unreal, unrealized, until he completes his odyssey, his journey, whose end hails the realization of his idea. He has created a dream, and he has aspired to reach that dream. In his confrontations with the evolved MECHA at the end of the movie, the incarnation of his long-dead mother IS that realization. Thus, at the end only the higher part of human nature is present: love. However, David extends himself beyond that. Humanity, after all, has not been shown to LOVE its creation.

717,criddic2,An example of the infinite powers of the imagination.,10,26 July 2001,"Steven Spielberg's ""A.I."" is an astonishment; a visual and story-telling achievement.  It centers on the story of a little robot, made to look, act and feel like a real little boy.  He is adopted by a couple who have supposedly lost their own son.  A scientist (William Hurt) warns them that if the robot is activated, he will forever love them as if he were real. When his adoptive mother Monica (Frances O'Connor) dumps him in the woods, David (the robot) becomes obsessed with finding the Blue Fairy from ""Pinocchio"" so she can make him real.  Then, he thinks, he'll be able to come home to his new family where he'll be loved. This sets up a long journey in which David and his Teddy join lover robot Gigolo Joe (Jude Law) on a wild adventure.The visuals in this movie are incredible, including a scary Flesh Fair, where robots are demolished by angry humans; an underwater Manhattan and others.  But the acting is even more exemplary, with the greatest credit going to young Haley Joel Osment as David.  His performance is a delicate balance between robot and human mannerisms.  Conveying emotions with a subtlety that is rare for actors his age (13) and playing many difficult scenes with the professionalism of an actor twice his age.  He is front and center throughout most of the film.  In short he deserves an Oscar nomination for Best Actor.  This would be historic, making Osment the second-youngest nominee in this category [and only the second child-actor, period, in a lead role].  Richard Dreyfuss' current record for youngest winner may be in jeopardy (he was 27 when he picked up his prize for ""The Goodbye Girl""). Jude Law is also a likely supporting nominee again, after ""The Talented Mr. Ripley.""Mr. Spielberg may have taken over from Stanley Kubrick but make no mistake: The finished product is a result of the talents of Spielberg and his team, combined with elements of Kubrick's vision.

718,pjcarline,A.I. ranks as one of the most infuriating films ever made.,6,1 November 2001,"A.I. ranks as one of the most infuriating films ever made. On the one hand, the first half of the film is stylish, sinister, thought-provoking - Kubrickian cinema at its awe-inspiring best. Spielberg managed to avoid his usual trick of laying sentimentality on with a trowel, and I was genuinely believing I was witnessing a masterpiece. However, when the motorbikes and taccy Running Man-esque lights appeared, it became apparent that this was not going to be the case. And then it just got worse, and worse, and worse. What on earth possessed the man to morph an eerie psychological drama into an ultimately boring and far-fetched yarn? The film is painfully long. The storyline meanders from mildly unbelievable to utterly incoherent. In the main, the acting was not as convincing as expected, Jude Law began to grate me, and also David's 'father', Sam Robards, flattered to deceive. I began to question my sanity when the film moved into a post-apocalyptic New York. How I wish Spielberg had questioned his.There are a few positives to be taken from A.I. Haley John Osment's performance brings guile, empathy and intelligence beyond his thirteen years, to a film which (apart from Teddy) is devoid of characters with any depth. His portrayal his character, David, ranks as one of the finest and most haunting performances I have seen. It is such a shame that the ridiculous storyline had me rooting for the conclusion of the film, not for the main character. Aesthetically, A.I is impressive, but with such a large budget, that is only to be expected. David's companion on his ludicrous quest, Teddy, also brought out the child in me and I found myself genuinely concerned for his wellbeing. As unbelievable as his recovery was, the introduction of David's 'brother' was a welcome addition to the film. The relationship between the two is something that was not handled badly, but could have definitely been handled better.Thus, A.I. left me wanting more. Why couldn't the film have reached a logical conclusion? Why was such a nonsensical and bastardised version of such a stimulating subject matter allowed to have been made? Has Spielberg finally lost the plot? If I were Kubrick, I would be turning in my grave, cursing the time I ever told my 'chum' Steve about a continuation of the HAL concept. I resent the fact that A.I. was made, as this is surely not the conclusion that Kubrick would have reached.

As they escape from New Atlantic City and fly to Man-hattan (now a city of the drowned) he makes his way from uptown to midtown to Coney Island in faster-than-fiction time and parks his semi-futuristic vehicle in front of a statue and waits...and waits... and waits... and waits......for 2000 years.

Ending (1) We simply take an experimental viewpoint of this A.I.'s life by having another meeting-complete with a now mental demonstration of David's pain. The callback here being when Dr. X demonstrated how a pinprick damaged, but didn't hurt the subject. And Joe's speech about loving what the machines do for human beings, not the machine's themselves. Callback also to Teddy's characteristics (2) The lifeless puppet, devoid of hope tips himself into the abyss. Ah, he is human after all. Is this what it is to be a human being? To give in?

I am not knocking this movie completly, it has wonderful moments and fantastic special effects. Some of the acting is outstanding, Jude Law in particular. I think that his performance as Gigolo Joe was wonderful and really convincing (surely the acid test of any acting performance), I think he should have received a best supporting actor nomination for his potrayal. His ""Singing in the Rain"" parody was particularly good.  I watched this film back to back with K-PAX and it's strengths show up the weaknesses of AI.

Dr. Know's answer is a poem that is not only the key for David's quest for the blue fairy, but the key to the film's true meaning as well:  ""Come away, O human child!/To the waters and the wild/With a faery, hand in hand/For the world's more full of weeping/than you can understand."" Stanley Kubrick's work was about the struggle human beings have in controlling the beast within. He knew that, as a rule, the beast ends up showing up. On the other hand, Spielberg's films celebrate the exceptions to that rule. These are in no way mutually exclusive points of view. In fact, they are both the sides of the same coin. The best fairy tales manage to be hopeful and dark at the same time. They are simple and sweet on the surface, but complex and even terrifying underneath. A.I. is one of those tales.

I've been reading many complaints about A.I. in this site and I'd like the comment briefly on some of them:1) ""The film is more Spielberg's than Kubrick's."" WRONG! I believe A.I. is pure Kubrick, right to the very end. I wonder if the ones who said that really know Kubrick's films.2)""It is pointless asking the audience to invest its emotions in a robot, because a robot is not real."" WELL...If you believe that, don't go to the movies either! MOVIES ARE NOT REAL and that is precisely one of the film's subtexts.3)""The ending is lame, sentimental, ludicrous."" Hahaha...The ending is, in fact, VERY clever. It is a hoax...to both David and the audience. A hint: In order to get DNA out of hair, you need the root. And no...That wasn't a mistake in Spielberg's screenplay! ;o)4)""The film never answers any question."" Of course not. This is an OPEN film. Kubrick worked that way and Spielberg followed suit. You have to do your homework. 5) ""That stupid narrator! Spielberg needs to spoonfeed his audience."" Kubrick liked to use those ""stupid narrators"" too. If you don't believe me, check ""Barry Lyndon"" and ""A Clockwork Orange"". The narration in A.I. does make sense...if you know who the narrator is. And I'm not talking about Ben Kingsley! ;o)I think that those who dislike the film will never change their minds, even if one analyzes the movie frame by frame for them. I checked imdb's user ratings for A.I. and they are almost identical to those of ""Eyes Wide Shut"", another misunderstood work of Kubrick. I guess that is the best compliment Spielberg could ever get! Fortunately, those under 20 y.o. seem to enjoy A.I. the most. That is what counts, because they are the critics of the future. The same happened to ""2001: A Space Odyssey"" 33 years ago.

734,sharif68,The First Great Film of the 21st Century,10,20 July 2001,"Great films have a cornucopia of emotions, thoughts, and ideas which in turn provokes intense discussion amongst moviegoers. A.I. is one those films, and not surprisingly most people that have seen this film are divided in their opinions. Either they loved it, or hated it. But whatever the opinions may be, it has us talking. And for that, Steven Spielberg has done his job as a filmmaker.WARNING: POSSIBLE SPOLIER ALERT!A.I. is the first great film of the 21st Century. It is filled with ambition, ambiguity, joy, wonder, melancholy, and terror that's a result of the strange but refreshing mixture of the styles and  sensibilities of two great filmmakers - Stanley Kubrick and Steven Spielberg. Based on the short story ""Supertoys Last All Summer Long"" by Brian Aldiss, A.I. is about a robot boy named David (played brilliantly by Haley Joel Osment) who longs to be a real boy. Inspired by the story ""Pinocchio"", David, with the help of a robot named Giggolo Joe (played by Jude Law, who is a hoot!) goes on a dangerous quest to find the Blue Fairy whom David believes can turn him into a real boy. David's quest leads him to places like the bawdy Rouge City and ultimately Manhattan which is completely underwater because the polar ice caps have melted. There in Manhattan is where the quest comes to a climax, leading to an Oedipal ending that is both sweet and sad. It's the main sequence of the film that's the most talked about.The film's photography, art direction (Rouge City and Manhattan looks awesome!), and special effects are first rate. This film should be a best picture nominee at next years Oscars.",A.I. Artificial Intelligence
735,jay_brown71,See D.A.R.Y.L.,2,17 September 2001,"This movie is indicative of the trend in movie making since the release of Star Wars. Story and writing has become secondary to special effects and cinematography. This movie has a beautiful screen presence and some breathtaking special effects, but where is the story? If I wanted special effects without story, I could just stay at home and watch commercials (some of which by the way have more depth than this movie) and save $9.00. There was, once again, a real chance to tell a story here, and for the first half an hour, it looked like they were on the right path. But with the first major plot direction change, it doesn't just slip a little, it falls flat on it's face, crawls for a bit, drags itself by the nails, and dies in what has to be one of the top ten most bizarre twists in Hollywood history. You begin with the feeling that you are watching some deep, introspective, question our own existence type of film, perhaps adapted from the stage, written by the most skilled of play-writes, and leaves you with the suspicion that halfway through production, they turned the writing over to the crew at ""Fast and the Furious"" and said ""Here are some special effects we want to use in this movie, can you write something around them? Doesn't matter if it has any relevance to the plot at all, don't care how weird it is, just help us put these pointless scenes on the screen."". If you want to see a film that actually does question our role and responsibilities as ""God"" - beings capable of creating sentient life -try D.A.R.Y.L. - not so many special effects, and probably not as pretty on the screen, but makes much more sense.",A.I.

Spielberg could have edited out at least a half hour out of this movie and nothing would have been lost.  In my opinion, most of the editing could of been done in the first and last acts.  Like most S.F. morality stories that have been made into movies, this one did not work.  This movie had shocking scenes only if you have never read any S.F. at all.

I had a hard time connecting with the characters. David's mother and her husband had no personality, they were the typical TV middle class attractive parents you could find anywhere in movies.  There were too many things left unexplained. I wasn't all that interested in this child's quest to find his mother, I wanted to know more about the scientific and cultural aspects of a world filled with artificial intelligence.  I believe it was a good idea, but Spielberg didn't carry it out to its full potential.  He focused too much on making the audience cry and not making them intrigued.",A.I. Artificial Intelligence
738,swampscrapper,Powerful Implications,9,8 July 2001,"This film explores the great dilemma that future generations will clearly confront.  How we deal with manufactured intelligence and and its moral implications.  If our manufacturers cannot yet create a flawless tire for cars some 80 plus years into production, what type of mistakes will we make once we begin developing intelligent machines.My favorites scenes of this movie included the dialog between the boys (David the ""mecha"" and Martin the real son) in the domestic setting.  It was fascinatingly uncomfortable to see the way Martin tempted the limits of David into mischief through his jealousy.  And later the mean spirited taunting David endured during the pool scene.  If I were God (ie Spielberg) I would have been happy to have explored David's acclimatization into a domestic family setting to a much greater degree without all of the fantasy and sci-fi that would fill the better part of the 2nd half of this film. David was programmed to want nothing more than the love of his Mother and family.  His naivete and want for love is something that the other characters have a hard time understanding and regardless of how real David seems at times, those around him never let go of the fact that he is a Mecha/Android.My take is that the point from which David falls to the bottom of the pool the audience enters the mind and dreams from the perspective of the artificially intelligent protagonist as the scientists perform adjustments and treatments.  One final scene with William Hurt would have confirmed this.This was a very powerful film.  Leave the kids at home and be prepared to open your mind.",A.I. Artificial Intelligence

Don't bother. I can only guess Spielberg finished this 'Kubrick' with the proper respect for one of the greatest directors of all time.This is not a movie, this is pretentious art. Pretentious, but actually making GOOD on its pretense. From my point of view, not in the negative sense of the word. Questions are asked and possible answers given, letting the viewer decide for themselves. Mindbogglingly, impressive camera-action. Brilliant soundtrack. Absolutely perfect acting by all players.

Even the incessant sound of popcorn crunching away behind me, was more entertaining. Did Stephen Spielberg set out to direct a film so abominable. Firstly, the plot was loose, tired and cliche, not to mention just uninteresting. The only slightly redeeming character was that of Teddy who has the potential to be psychotic and therefore a slight edge. I just wanted the kid to die throughout. There was no emotion in the film. Just dead. I didn't care about the characters. Au contraire, I wanted them to die as quickly as possible.

After David's ""sins"", he is cast out of ""Eden"" into a cruel and dark world.From that time on, David journeys through the horrors of ill-treatment of his kind much like man's own vicious treatments toward others in the history of man.Then the last act is Spielberg's own version and idea of salvation by beings that are not human.  With David it is his own evolved race of ""Mecha"" beings.

Well, ok, there was something at the very end that might be a bit doggy, but by then you're dealing with something so advanced, so unfathomable, it didn't bother me much. Also a big corporation that's smart enough to make a robot as sophisticated as David is unlikely to do a few things depicted in the film that were sort of dumb, but I confess these objections didn't occur to me until the movie was over and they did advance the plot so I'll cut the movie people a little slack.I'm certain time will be kind to this movie, I think this is the sort of film that will improve each time you see it.

The movie project's other main marketing element is that this was a Stanley Kubrick pet project for a long time that was picked up by Steven Spielberg after Kubrick died,  with major financial backing from Kubrick's home studio (Warner Bros.) and Spielberg's outfit (DreamWorks).  For a mainstream Spielberg to associate himself with a pet project of out-of-this-world Kubrick should by itself give anyone on Earth a concrete idea (in bright, neon lights, if I may add) as to what to expect from this movie.  If you did not, what planet did you come from?In other words, the marketing experts and the people behind this project have forewarned us that when watching this movie, we should suspend our current beliefs  (or more aptly, our current disbeliefs) and open our minds to uneasy questions and possibilities as members of the human race.  Why is it that we can understand and enjoy Godzilla, Superman, Star Wars, E.T., Planet of the Apes, etc. and not A.I.?  Please keep the answer to yourself because no matter how you want to express the multi-dimensional aspect of your mind, it is not going to be multi-dimensional enough for A.I.Spielberg is no doubt a master storyteller and director, and he reminds me of Alfred Hitchcock.  I did not like Spielberg's Amistad and Hitchcock's Spellbound, but I do not hold it against them.  No matter what, both directors are able to hold my bladder for 2 hours.A.I. is like traveling to the unknown.  I was totally unprepared for the second hour of Spielberg's A.I.  His second hour assaulted my mind multi-dimensionally and mercilessly (for lack of better words).  I thought the movie could have ended at least 3 different times during its last hour, but like a roller coaster ride to the unknown (for lack of a better comparison), it just kept going and going and going and going (to my utter amazement, discomfort and impatience).  I was dazed  and mezmerized when the movie finally ended.  Up to now, I'm still grappling with some of the questions that I think even Spielberg himself did not conjure up in this movie.   And that's amazing.  It's not a Moulin Rouge (another new summer movie that I like very much); it's A.I. (as in Artistically Infinite).
A.I.'s art, as with a painting, is in the eye of the beholder.  If you did not sense and appreciate the parallels and double entendres in the movie, you definitely went off to a different direction.  In A.I., the future and the present are one in more ways than one, and that's excellent science fiction in my book.My congratulations to Spielberg, Warner Bros. and DreamWorks.",A.I.

It's all so jaw-droppingly real, and yet at the same time unique, that it just imprints in your mind like no other film. The New York sequences are especially amazing.-Artistic (Visually, Aurally, Acting): The artistic design in this movie is amazing. Everything is futuristic, yet strangely real, and all the sets have the same Kubrickian sterility and chromed look. Superb. Also, the soundtrack by John Williams is one of the best I've heard recently, subtle and yet strangely hypnotic. The performances are excellent, especially by Osment and O'Connor, and by Hurt. Law is great, but I felt that his sub-plot was too truncated.-Story (Emotions, Intelligence): Ooooh boy, here the flaws come rolling in. The first two hours of this movie are some of the most captivating, brilliant, thought-provoking and philosophically charged hours I've ever experienced. They tell a story that feels like a futuristic fairy tale merged with an Asimov short story, all told by Kubrick. But then the last half-hour sets in, and here I feel Spielberg dropped the ball really hard. I really expected - MAJOR SPOILERS - the story to end underwater on Coney Island,  but the whole sequence with the aliens felt so artificial, so pulled by the hair, and so conflicting with the last two hours that it almost wrecked the movie for me (I say almost, because it still asks some intelligent moral questions that may have you thinking for a long time). -END OF MAJOR SPOILERS. Basically, if they would have dropped the final ending and replaced it's running time with more complete sub-plots, the movie would have been - dare I say this - close to perfect.Conclusion: The movie is good. Really good if you can overlook the last half-hour. It's the most ambitious, intelligent, thought-provoking and visually haunting piece I've seen in a very long time, and Spielberg should be strongly commended for having the guts to bring Kubrick's vision to the screen.

757,theCodmate,The most sadly misunderstood film,9,4 November 2002,"* SPOILERS *The vast majority of people have misunderstood this wonderful, intelligent movie.This is a film partly about the ever-increasing anthropomorphic nature of our tools, toys and gadgets. It uses the Pinocchio story as a template and elements from Brian Aldis' bleak short-story to drive the plot.Every scene in the film raises philosophical questions about our increasing reliance on technology and the forms that technology takes. We should also be questioning our emotional reactions to each scene as we watch it. Why do we empathise with David when he is dumped in the woods, why do we empathise with Teddy when he is being taunted, why do we feel the cruelty of David's 'brother' and fear the outcome of his jealousy so intensely? These things are just machines - why should we care?The most striking moments are when the machines empathise (or would SYMpathise be more appropriate?) with each other, at the flesh-fair, Gigolo Joe helping David, Teddy protecting David...It doesn't fail to send shivers down my spine when Gigolo Joe proclaims 'They made us too good to quick'. These machines are so complex they have evolved emotional responses of their own (or at least the ability to display them as a consequence of their programming). Whether they are 'real' or not these mechanical emotions serve the purpose of ours (which are fairly mechanical themselves - relying on chemical reactions between hormones in our bodies, there is nothing spiritual about adrenaline, testosterone et al) and this provokes a mixture of feelings feelings of dread, awe, guilt - and indeed empathy are provoked by the AI's superb script, acting, direction and cinematography which relates the ideas I am delving into here (and many more) in intelligent and stylish fashion.Empathy has been explored before in a book about the nature of humanity that introduces mechanical (or in this case synthetic) emotions. This book is the famous ""Do Android's Dream of Electric Sheep"" (later Bladerunner) by Phillip K Dick and returns with a vengeance in this film to similar but even more devastating effect.The ending of this movie is hotly debated - many misunderstood it utterly - even thinking the robots of the future being depicted were aliens! This ending is utterly chilling - humanity has passed on and the robots are our true 'children'. David is discovered during an archaeological expedition by these new highly advanced robots and appears as an ancient still-functioning relic who holds information of much use to them. The robots only function was to provide joy by receiving love (like a complex Teddy bear). He is put out of his constant 'misery' (or what we would interpret in human terms as misery) by these future-robots when they conjure an illusion of his 'mother' in his mind for him out of some DNA.At this moment we realise that it is a chilling thought that humans could create a being that could feel misery in this way. Requiring the love of one person but never able to get it - even if they wait for many millennia. And then, with an almost-imperceptible jerk of the head, David 'dies' and we remember - this is *just* a machine. We also realise on second viewing that David doesn't blink one for the entire film.I have covered some of the main points of the film in a very slapdash way. I hope that my ragged conveyance of these ideas (especially compared to how they are put across in the film) can convince some people to go back to this movie and experience it as the master-work it truly is.When you see this film remember that this is not Die Hard with robots - you are watching an intelligent and emotionally complex film.

760,warlokc,AI: This movie is so bad it is hard to know where to begin.,2,30 June 2001,"For those lucky enough not to have seen AI, it is a ham-handed attempt to update the fairy-tale of Pinocchio into a modern science-fiction film. Unfortunately, AI fails as both fairy-tale and science-fiction.  The plot seems to have been strung together from the abstracts of several other movies, as if the studio couldn't decide which film it wanted to make, and just decided to make them all.  Spielberg doesn't seem to have a firm grasp on whether he is trying to make a film which makes literal sense, or one which casts aside realism in favor of deeper mythological truth.  Over explanation, (often well past the point of absurdity,) plagues this film at every turn.There are some high points in this total failure.  The special effects are fantastic.  I also found the story of Jude Law's character Joe, the robot gigolo, to be very entertaining.  Law's performance is truly magnificent, but like every other side point which nearly works in AI, it merely serves as another opportunity for the audience to think, ""Why didn't they make a movie about this instead?""Would Kubrik have fared better at the helm?  I don't know.  He might have stayed away from some of the more gag-worthy schlock, but it is hard to imagine how this script could have been salvaged.The bottom line is that AI is a long, boring story, told in a self-important, condescending tone.

761,King of Pain,One of a kind.,9,26 September 2001,"*Spoilers!*This has to be one of the most original, affecting and entertaining films I've seen.I wasn't expecting the film to be as emotionally upsetting as it is. Knowing that David is programmed to love (and thus meaning he'll do anything to win his mother's love), you're watching an inevitable downward spiral for him; Monica's real son gets him in serious trouble several times, gradually destroying any trust or feeling she has for him.  The scene where David is abandoned by Monica is horrific - by this point you've almost forgotten he's a robot and the effect is so strong thanks to Haley Joel Osment's amazing performance.The mecha Gigolo Joe (Jude Law) is such a relief as not only is he an entertaining character but he becomes David's first real (!) friend after his family's disposal.  The Flesh Fair sequence is enhanced by seeing Ministry perform 'What About Us?' as robots are being torn apart - I never thought I'd see that band in a Spielberg film!The scenes in Manhattan are eerie and breathtaking - the city is submerged thanks to polar ice caps melting - and are as seamless visually as previous effects sequences in the film.  The World Trade Centre towers sticking out of the water is quite poignant due to what's happened (it brought gasps from the audience I watched the picture with a few days ago).In agreement with comments before this one, I too found the film's ending to sit uneasily with the action preceding, moving from bleakness to warmth - but to have ended the film at the point on the seabed would have been unfulfilling.  For all the trauma and pain that David goes through on his lengthy journey I think Spielberg was right to give him (and the audience) something back - otherwise the film's whole journey leads nowhere.The film won't suit everyone (the ending, the pacing) but I can't imagine any viewer not finding at least one element that will stick in their brain for many days/weeks/months after they've seen the film.  I, for one, can't WAIT for this to come out on DVD.  It's too soon after seeing it for the first time, but I think this is a possible masterpiece and will become one of my favourite films ever.",A.I.

762,bushido_man,The point was well-communicated,10,27 October 2002,"*** POSSIBLE SPOILER ***I've read a lot of negative reviews about this film, and I honestly think that most of them were not deserved. This film is more fantasy than science fiction, and it should be viewed in that light. The thing that struck me most, and which still lingers on, is the profound message of the great responsibility that we assume when we cause others to love us. The character of David was particularly pathetic, because after he was programmed to love unconditionally and subsequently abandoned, he was unable to rid himself of this feeling. Corporate greed created him, his ""mother"" selfishly inflicted this condition on him out of sheer loneliness and desperation, and David in all his innocence was the one left to suffer throughout eternity. This is a very powerful theme that has been omitted from most reviews I have seen. The fact that the story takes place in a fantasy setting should not detract the viewer from this point; in fact, it emphasizes the point, as David's unconditional love for his mother never waivers, even after the thousands of years of suffering that has been wrought upon him. Despite its ""happy"" ending, this is a sad film that should cause all of us to stop and think before we toy with other people's feelings.",A.I. Artificial Intelligence

I am not going to spoil it, but for anyone who has had a lifelong dream for their child come to reality, then you will want to see this. This is a power movie! David really comes into being as the movie progresses and has a singular desire. Through adventure and adversity, he finally achieves his goal. That is where the ""water-works"" began for me, and as a 35 year old man, I am not afraid to say it. The story is presented very well, and the acting is excellent. Jude Law, William Hurt, but great. David, played by Haley Joel Osment was, as in The Sixth Sence, excellent and carries the lead very competently! Not many young actors can do what he does. It is really the progression of the story that should keep you watching, and following the development of David and he never-ending determination. We can learn from this characteristic.

That man created both the ugliness and the vessel that housed the beauty is a theme as old as time. A.I.is a mesmerizing albeit disturbing look at the pathos of existence.

Also John Williams composed one of the best film scores of all time which highlighted the film in a perfect way. I even liked the song! It's just like watching a Stanley Kubrick film (most specifically, ""2001: A Space Odyssey"" and ""Eyes Wide Shut"").Also the ending was nothing short of spectacular. Spielberg put everything on the line, and he came up with the most brilliant ending imaginable, not to mention it was totally unpredictable (maybe even for psychics); no one could have guessed it, that's why I think a lot of Americans didn't like it; in general we tend to dislike something if we don't expect it.WARNING, DO NOT READ THE FOLLOWING IF YOU HAVEN'T SEEN THE FILM YET:They were robots at the end, not aliens.

770,d94rc,after a promising start the film goes badly off the rails and makes little sense,2,22 September 2001,"This is a turkey. No, seriously - save it for Thanksgiving.The film starts really well and is something of a cross between Pinnochio, Robocop and DARYL (1985)! The way in which the robot moves to showing human emotion is really nicely done and neatly moves onto the main theme of the film - David's struggle between that part of him which is robot and the part that is human.  Haley Joel Osment does a good job here and shows more acting ability than many of the humans - though I'd recommend 'Pay it Forward' as a script worthy of his talents.This film had promise and looked like becoming a family-friendly thought provoker.All of a sudden though, in Act II, somebody completely lost the plot and we were bizarrely transformed into a vision of the future that was like a cross between Blade Runner and Super Mario Brothers. In trying to be an adult movie but aiming at a PG certificate, the film goes downhill very badly and you feel as if you have changed channels to watch something different from the opening section. It just didn't work.Act III just gets plain weird. If I wrote the plot the reader wouldn't believe it - the film gets really ludicrous. In going for a novel (yet family oriented) view of the future we get something more akin to 'Flight of the Navigator' crossed with '2001' crossed with heartwarming, fuzzy sentiment.Conclusion: after a promising start the film goes badly off the rails and makes little sense. It is not, as some suppose a new fairy tale - it would probably give young children I know nightmares!! It is, however either a kids movie that hopes for an adult audience or vice versa, with a rehash of many ideas that have been far better set out before (e.g. Robocop, Blade Runner).2/10, though could have been 8 or 9.",A.I. Artificial Intelligence
771,long_christopher,Two Universes Collide,8,13 January 2005,"A.I. Artificial Intelligence is set in the future when androids are commonplace and are even used to replace family members. The film bears the Auteur ship of both Steven Spielberg and Stanley Kubrick, directed by Spielberg and based on storyboards originally envisaged by Kubrick. Spielberg's love of the action genre and Kubrick's more psychological approach to film making give A. I. a feeling of two opposing universes colliding on screen and this difference between the two styles remains evident to the audience throughout the film.The narrative of A.I. follows David, one such android, who is adopted by the Swinton family in order to fill the gap left by their real son Martin, who has gone missing. However when Martin returns, family relations become strained and David is shunned. This is the catalyst for David's quest to become a real boy. Stanley Kubrick's directing style is to create a film that deals with various themes, which will keep the audience thinking long after the credits have rolled. In A.I., Kubrick's influence can be seen in two main themes; firstly that of an outsider not being accepted into society. David is the obvious outsider in the Swinton family, especially when Martin returns. Martin feels threatened by David whom he feels is invading his territory and, along with his friends, taunts the android about how different he is from them all. Secondly, the theme of the 'fairytale' is developed as the narrative progresses. Two fairy tales are symbolised in A.I.; Hansel and Gretel, and the Wizard of Oz. In Hansel and Gretel one parent loves and another abandons the children; this is shown in A.I. when David's adopted mother tries to save his life after his Father sends him away. At this point in the film David begins his quest, which is representative of Dorothy's journey in the Wizard of Oz. Both are seeking a wizard to solve their problems. Another fairytale element is the presence of a narrator, which occurs late in the film.However, these thought-provoking themes are soon replaced by Steven Spielberg's love of the action genre. This is represented by the arrival of the ships, which take androids away and put them on show for human amusement. During this sequence, every filmic device is heightened: the colour becomes bolder and the presence of a bright blue search light serves to wake the audience up from their quiet deliberations on what has preceded. This part of the film is reminiscent of Ridley Scott's 'Bladerunner', where machines are hunted down by humans. Given the thought provoking nature early in the film, this machine hunting sequence seems strangely out of place and clearly demonstrates the opposing universes of Kubrick and Spielberg. The soundtrack makes itself known suddenly and abruptly as the audience is drawn into Spielberg's world of gigolo androids and burlesque houses. It is here that David finds his companion who helps him on the quest to find the blue fairy. Spielberg shoots this search in wide angle to give the audience a real sense of being part of the action.A.I. contains elements that radically oppose each other and do not always make for seamless viewing; the line between Spielberg and Kubrick's directing styles is visible at all times. However, A.I. is still an enjoyable piece of work and should get credit, no matter who had overall artistic control. 7/10",A.I. Artificial Intelligence

As long as it can hold my attention, it'll do. This was probably the most boring movie I've seen since ""Ishtar""; this is compounded by the fact that it was about 11 hours long.I'll not go into all the other reasons this movie reeks so distinctly as a tiny floater in the mighty pile of dung that represents ALMOST EVERY MOVIE EVER MADE.

Instead you get a really awful film, that whilst overly long by about thirty minutes feels incomplete. It seems very apparent that it was two directors interpretation of the script edited together in a mish mash of hash. I was very disappointed with this film and the storyline lifted from Pinocchio and frankenstein set in a future where robots fill the voids in our lives, until they are replaced by upgrades or even humans (think ""I want to be a real boy""). This movie could and should have been a lot better, the set ups and special effects are excellent, but the studio should really have bit the bullet and pulled the film and let somebody have a go from scratch. Then there is the sentiment you get from having watched the film. Firstly you feel rather than annoyed that you have just wasted nearly two and a half hours of your life watching this. Secondly you feel utterly depressed and bordering on suicidal having watched David's agonising search for parental love and meaning of his existence.

775,sinanipek,A.I. vs. SOLARIS,8,7 December 2003,"When I watched the movie for the first time, I felt sorry for all beings who possess intelligence either artificial or organic. The film is about the agony of existence. We can call this agony as 'the ontological trauma'. When a being, no matter if it is human or non-human, organic or mechanical, is aware of its existence, that makes him very exceptional and tragic. First of all, he knows that he is mortal, impotent and temporary. He knows that the memories lost in time cannot be retrieved authentically. He grasps the idea that there is pain everywhere. He understands that the search for eternal love cannot be fulfilled completely. There's pain, suffering, and hate in this universe.In this movie, the main source of the ontological trauma is the unsatisfiable desire for being loved while in Stanislaw Lem's Solaris, it is the impossibility of recreating a woman who committed suicide when left by the main character of the novel. Solaris is the name of an ocean-planet. The ocean is alive as well as intelligent and capable of doing everything except to kill itself. That serves as another source for the ontological trauma.If you read Solaris, you can find some similarities between the book and the movie. The novel emphasizes mostly on the philosophical aspects of the tragedy of being while the movie focuses on the emotional consequences of it. The movie focuses on the eternal pain of loosing parents just the way as someone who suffers while seeking the object of his desire.If you could isolate the sorrow and look at it closely, perhaps you could notice that it is as heavy as a black-hole. It wants to suck everything instantly and inescapably. ***Spoilers after here*** The surrealistic-beings at the end of the film must be brave and strong; because, they tried to heal the pain of poor David as the Ocean in Solaris failed to do so.",A.I.

From that, he proved he could walk with giants of cinema.After that, he made SAVING PRIVATE RYAN. From that, he proved that he could take cinema into visceral realms that would have had Sam Peckinpah shaking in his boots.Then, Stanley Kubrick bequeathed a project to him. That project was AI, and it seemed that Spielberg, after approaching Kubrickian detachment with SCHINDLER'S LIST and parts of SAVING PRIVATE RYAN, decided to regress to the ""Nudge, Nudge, Wink, Wink"" school of Moviemaking that many have shunned him for. I have to say this: the results are quite disappointing.I will not fault the film technically, for on that realm, it is superb. It is Spielberg's execution of scenes that in the hands of Kubrick would have been chilling (ie., Dave's murder of his robotic twin) and intriguing (i.e, The Flesh Fair), turn out to be turgid and banal.I have just one hope for Spielberg long term: forget about the audience.

The little lad David was an obnoxious little snot and part of me wished he would go under the acid in the 'Flesh Fair' scene but no - the mob decided that because he was appealing looking he could live, when all those other odd looking machines prior to him, the poor dustbin with a face and the machine with the woman's face plus the others were rounded up and torn apart! I did like the Gigolo Joe character, the way he moved and spoke, and how he changed his hair colour with a twitch and switched on romantic music by jerking his head.

However these are the same people that would give ""John Tucker Must Die"" a 10 if Stanley Kubrick had directed that!This 2001 American science fiction drama film directed by Steven Spielberg. The screenplay by Spielberg was based on a screen story by Ian Watson and the 1969 short story ""Super-Toys Last All Summer Long"" by Brian Aldiss. The film was produced by Kathleen Kennedy, Spielberg and Bonnie Curtis. It stars Haley Joel Osment, Jude Law, Frances O'Connor, Brendan Gleeson and William Hurt. Set in a futuristic post-climate change society, A.I. tells the story of David (Osment), a childlike android uniquely programmed with the ability to love.Development of A.I. originally began with producer-director Stanley Kubrick, after he acquired the rights to Aldiss' story in the early 1970s. Kubrick hired a series of writers until the mid-1990s, including Brian Aldiss, Bob Shaw, Ian Watson, and Sara Maitland. The film languished in protracted development for years, partly because Kubrick felt computer-generated imagery was not advanced enough to create the David character, whom he believed no child actor would convincingly portray. In 1995, Kubrick handed A.I. to Spielberg, but the film did not gain momentum until Kubrick's death in 1999. Spielberg remained close to Watson's film treatment for the screenplay. However the lack of a central focus makes this film languish.When I saw this I could not believe how boring it was! The movie had a promising start! What really doesn't work is that 1/2 way through the movie just becomes a chase movie and its not a very exciting chase!

I found it a profoundly moving and supremely emotional experience, to put it mildly.  In fact, I was so overcome with emotion by the end of the movie, I was literally choking back sobs. 
Why did this movie affect me?   I honestly don't know.  Compared to most viewers, I think I had an unusually strong emotional reaction, none of the critics reviews described it as a tearjerker.  Maybe it was Haley Joel Osment's amazing performance.  One thing I noticed is that like a true robot, he never blinked.  He was actually kind of creepy at first, but by the end I actually felt sorry for David, even though he was, essentially, a machine. That kid deserves another Oscar nomination.Jude Law's performance was also very good, his character Gigolo Joe was entertaining and lightened up the somber mood cast by David's obsession with finding the Blue Fairy and reuniting with his mother.  I would have liked to see more of his character interacting with his ""clients"".  The concept of an artificial lover was intriguing, from a woman's point of view.  With his perfectly made up features, he looked artificial but strikingly beautiful. He was all style, all prancing, preening attitude.   The movie could have ended at several points before it actually does, and think at Spielberg took it a bit further than is necessary, but overall it kept my interest, and emotions, at an appropriate level.This is not a movie that everyone will like.   Teens, in particular, may find the pace too slow.  Its certainly not a check-your-brains-at-the-door summer popcorn flick.

786,tblewis,Spielberg is good. The film is not.,1,12 March 2002,"(++++Spoilers) Can anybody answer these 4 questions about A.I. for me:       One, is there a single scene in this movie that doesn't go on way too long?     Two, is it true that a movie's in trouble when it suddenly sprouts an omniscient narrator in the last ten minutes, just to make sure it overstates whatever point the preceding 2 ½ hours failed to drive home? Three, how'd we go from global warming to Ice Age in just two thousand years?     Four, I get it that the omnipotent liquid-metallic aliens could clone the weird android kid's mother from her hair -- despite the fact that it was cut hair, and you need the hair root to clone from, because it's the scalp cells that contain DNA, not the protein fibers of human hair. But the liquid mind-reading aliens aren't bothered by that technicality, and they clone her anyway. And somehow the aliens got all her memories back into her brain, including her recent memories of the freaky android kid, because the aliens evidently have discovered that human beings encode memories in their hair. (Is that just scalp hair, by the way, or is it body hair as well?) So the liquid omnipotent psychic benevolent post-Ice-Age anorexic aliens clone the android kid's mother from the cut hair fragments that Teddy had in his pocket for two thousand years, the hairs that somehow didn't rot, but then the loveable well-meaning aliens ran afoul of this metaphysical barrier dictating that cloned mothers can only last for a day, because the space-time currents have decreed that once a space-time pathway is used, it can never be used again -- or least it *can* be used, OK, but just for 24 hours  because metaphysical barriers are flexible that way, and it's more of a guideline, really, than a rule. Now this guideline, flexible as it is, really befuddles the elegant long-limbed super-badass-cloning alien guys, the ultra-smart and so-very-nice aliens who can clone the mom from acellular cut hair just as they could probably clone her from her exhaled breath  but this super-restrictive space-line continuum 24-hour-maternal-expiration-date problem they just can't get around. My question is this: wouldn't it just be better if Spielberg himself stuck his head in the frame of the movie at this point in the film and said, ""Look -- OK -- I've got a point I want to make, and the plot I've got running here won't really accomodate my point. Could I just say it to you straight out, and then I could avoid all these corny plot contrivances? Would that be OK? Great.

That's what happened to me here.Yes, I found some of it incredulous, rushed, underdeveloped and overfamiliar but overriding this was a feeling of being in the presence of something much closer to humanity than many would like to admit. There are tremendous moments in this film, notably the first 45min (Kubrickesque), the Flesh Fair scene, the trip to New York and the eventual resolution. I would agree that it does feel a bit patched together and over-edited but the alternative would have been 4hrs or so (probably a better film). If Spielberg had made this 15yrs ago, it would  have been gigantic. If Kubrick had released it then, it may have been even better.

I suppose you are riding for a fall if you look forward to a film for months but truly this was more than disappointing. The idea is fine and obviously the technical side in the hands of a master (the special effects are quite stunning). But the story, Mr. Spielberg, the good old fashioned skill of story-telling has deserted you. Were you blinded by the fact that you had to honour the considerable memory of your dead mentor? The use of voice overs is lazy and indicates lack of planning. The fact that the last half an hour of the film is entirely serviced by voice over bodes ill for the conclusion of the story. And indeed that is the problem. Up until about half away the film spins you round with emotional dilemmas and social comment. Wonderfully acted and beautifully shot it gets so bogged down in it's own convolutions that you are dying for a 4x4. Spielberg paints himself into a corner and can't get himself out again, hence the voice overs and the conclusion of the story which is fantasy (as it should be) but really too much.

Spielburg directs it. Kubrick thought of it. The story itself, the short story it was based on, seemed interesting. With expectations this high, one can only expect that a movie isn't going to meet them. But that wasn't the case. I loved the movie walking out of the theater. I still look back fondly on the movie. Osment was amazing in his role. O'Conner was great as well. The graphics were amazing. Seeing New York City under those conditions was very startling and just fun to watch. The storyline was good, I don't care what anybody else thinks, Act 1 especially. The subtle acting between Osment and O'Conner was very well done. And Spielburg's usual direction was great of course too. Act 2's resemblence to the gathering up of Jewish people during the Holocaust was also great.       I do agree on one point most people make. The movie did let me down a bit. It was too much like Bicentennial man. And the obsession of the blue fairy was a little over the top. But I believe that everything else in the movie was great enough to make it a worth-while film. If you haven't seen it, don't let other people's opinions keep you from seeing it.

The classical music playing sometimes. Making the narrator English. I'm sure this movie would have been better if Kubrick had directed it, but Speilberg didn't do too bad of a job. The Blue Fairy stuff got old. Osment was excellent as David, also. The movie had a very creepy aspect to it.

At half it's actual length it may have squeezed by as a second-rate family film. At present, it only succeeds as an audience endurance contest.Kubrick-esque images of submissive women, phallic symbols, the presence of ""gigalo Joe,"" as well as familliar themes of space-age technology and Man's incapacity to control the power he has created, are interjected intermittantly and conspicuously here. These symbols and images become muddled, at best, through Spielburg's obsessions with the overtly cute and ""happy"" endings. The main problem here is too many possibilities for endings strung together, leaving the audience restless.This muddies any clean-cut attempt for the social comment about our selfish nature and inability to control the technological monsters we create. Amid hokey dialogue and corny sensibilities Osment manages a good performance. Jude Law, with the aid of a mechanized bear, adds style, pinache, and humor to an otherwise ill-fated attempt to cash in on Spielberg's previous work, and allusions to his own Amblin Entertainment.",A.I.

796,sidmclean,A great cinematic achievement,10,18 September 2001,"IT HAS to be one of the stranger meldings of cinematic history. Steven Spielberg, the virtuoso of emotional audience manipulation, takes on a project originally conceived by Stanley Kubrick, the auteur of clinical cinema. The result is nothing short of breathtaking. In a waterlogged world where reproduction is restricted, 'mechas', advanced androids, are created to serve and help mankind, Professor Hobby (William Hurt) has a dream to create a robot capable of love. His name is David (Haley Joel Osment), and he is adopted as a test case by a Monica and David (Frances O'Connor and Sam Robards), distraught with their own son cryogenically frozen because of a terminal illness. Initially Monica is horrified - but her instincts to cherish take over and the couple activate the robot's love circuits.David is a strange child - despite his unconditional love, his incomprehension of human emotions is clear. And finally, a series of events lead to the inevitable rift between mother and 'child', and the boy programmed to love is abandoned.From the detached household environment where we start, David now finds himself alone in the world. A world where abandoned mechas scrabble through scrap piles in a ghoulish attempt to replace their own damaged parts, providing some of the film's CGI highlights.. A world of flesh fairs, where disillusioned humans take umbrage at the insult to humanity they see in the prevalence of robots, and 'celebrate' their humanity by rounding up and destroying unlicensed mechas. Coming across the love mecha Gigolo Joe (Jude Law), the pair embark on a quest to help David achieve his humanity, by becoming a real boy - the  way he dreams that Monica will come to love him. Cementing his reputation as an acting prodigy with an astounding performance, Osment carries the film. From the cold mechanical personality he shows at the start, David changes almost imperceptively through the film, and it's only near the end it hits home just how much the character has changed. With every mannerism and quirk precisely executed, for any other actor it would be the performance of a lifetime. Spielberg's creation overflows with questions. From the debate of whether humanity is playing God, who created mankind to love him, to the Pinocchio quest of whether it is possible to earn humanity, and the  utopian question of whether we create our villains and then punish them for our mistakes. The film's atmosphere is precisely gauged at all times - the dispassionate nature of David's starting home, the Blade Runner qualities of den of iniquity Rouge City, the 2001-reminiscent air of the strange and distinctly Kubrickian closing scenes. Debates will doubtless rage about whether the very ending, where the film finally gives in to a little sentimentality, is in tune with the rest of the film.

There's a lot of cruelty done to David by his mother, so as I watched the ending I was astounded. Forget Close Encounters, this is the ending from Hook. Personally, when Gigolo Joe is sucked off screen, they could have ended the movie there. Another annoying aspect was David's treatment of Teddy (it's no better than his family's treatment of him). The snarling teddy bear was a more developed character than David. Brian Aldiss was right. They shouldn't have put in the f-ing blue fairy.  If you go see this movie, just exit when Jude Law exits.

I am not in the mood to quibble about the few rough spots in the script and the borderline performance of a couple of minor players (Sam Robards is fairly unconvincing in my book--not sure if it's him or his lines--but he just didn't click with me). Easy to forgive when weighed against the stellar work of Haley Osment and Jude Law (not to mention a little diamond of a performance turned in by by Clara Bellar as the obsolete mecha-nanny).

Well, it isn't a very very good film. It is a very very strange film. When I was watching the film I never got completly lost in the story. But it has been 5 days I have seen the movie, and I'm still thinking about it. Heck, I'm even writing some comments about the film.Because he is a robot, it is not easy to sympathise with david, but at the other hand, it is not easy not to sympathise whit the ""cute little boy"". I don't know what the most difficult scene is in the movie, the scene where his mother leaves her mecha-child in the woods, or the scene where that mecha-child sits at the table and is watching how his parents eat. You are scared of the person you want to identify with. This is what makes this film so strange and difficult to love. But this is also what makes this film so much better than all the other movies playing in the same theatre.The discussions about what is kubrick and what is Spielberg, they are useless. When I watched the film I never wonderd which of the scenes were created by spielberg or which by Kubrick. The second ending where so much is written about is not as melodramatic as everybody seems to agree. It is this latest twist that makes you want forget the film so easy.

I sense this film will be greatly misunderstood and unappreciated. I hope not, but the average movie goer these days is not up to the challenge this film offers.  However, for those of us who look deeper, A.I. Artificial Intelligence is an excellent story with many levels of meaning. It asks/ponders the question of human dreams.  Or more directly, our desires or yearning to reach impossible goals.  It tells us the future is a place of dreams where fantasy is reality.  It also takes a look at the nature of family in a subtlety disguised manner.  One can see how love for ones parent ties into how one will view death and loss.  Additionally, the film boasts many other treats.  Wonderfully shot the film has a luster about it that makes it seem so dream like.  Shots melt in and out of each other as the fairy tale references fall out all over the screen.  The atmosphere blends extremely well with the themes of the piece.  Also, the cast are superbly understated and yet theatrical.  Haley Joel Osmett should garner another oscar nomination for this performance.

Perhaps this movie might have not been quite so vomitous had Stanley Kubrick lived to complete it.

It is never easy to see the human condition diminished in such an oppressive way.  Movies like 'War of the Worlds', 'Mad Max', and other apocalyptic and post-apocalyptic movies brings out a depth of serious sadness from us, because as human-beings, we really believe that we are going to prevail and win the good fight.  A.I. forces us to deal with disturbing issues, including the responsibility we as human-beings have to those less fortunate than ourselves, and the grief of dealing with the death of those we love.The casting for the film was well chosen.  Jude Law played his role exceptionally as a robot created to service women sexually.  His humorous posturing made him a likeable character as he danced in puddles of water like Fred Astaire, joyfully explaining describing his prowess with ""the women"". Frances O'Connor, who played the mother of the robot child (Haley Joel Osment), seemed more like a child, at times, than David, which added to the charm of their relationship.  William Hurt played the role of creator of the robots, which set the tone for what I believe is one of Mr. Spielberg's most recurring messages in his larger-than-life films; the consequences of death and the consequences of playing God.  Mr. Hurt skillfully plays all the aspects of the mad scientist which makes us both pity and loathe him the same way we did Richard Attenborough's character in 'Jurassic Park', the man who played God by cloning dinosaurs; his, the very epitome of human arrogance.  Further, I cannot overlook Haley Joel Osment's performance as David, the robot child that would-be-human.  I am torn because there is a part of me that fears the aftermath of giving too much credit to one who has so little experience.  However, it has become too obvious that this kid has incredible natural talent.  Haley has the ability to become the character in ways that make it difficult to distinguish the boy from the role.When I first saw the trailer for this movie, I immediately thought of a 1985 film in which a robot child named 'D.A.R.Y.L.' (an acronym for Data Analyzing Robot Youth Lifeform) is found by a married couple that have no children.  The starring role was played brilliantly by one of my favorite young actors, Barret Oliver.  While 'D.A.R.Y.L.' was a good film and most certainly reached the heartstrings, it was primarily centered on one family. A.I. looks at the human condition and deals with serious moral issues, which in my humble opinion, makes it a huge film that I foresee becoming a classic of the latter half of the twenty-first century.In conclusion, I think A.I. is one of those movies that holds all of us accountable for social responsibility.  Cynics may think the overall connotation of this movie out-dated or boring, yet it deals with issues that we are still struggling with today.  It also deals with issues yet to come, because with technology growing at such a rapid pace, the premise of this film surpasses the metaphorical message and becomes an exacting moral issue. It causes us to deal with the possibility of a new race, whether 'orga' or 'mecca' and hopefully forces us to redefine our view of what personal freedom is, giving new hope to those who are oppressed.  Those persons in denial who choose not to see the moral implications of this film, in answer to the question, ""What did you like about A.I.?"", will no doubt answer, ""Really cool special effects.""  Such is the way of those who are not comfortable thinking outside of a box.  I, for one, am a movie buff who is grateful when a director seeks to make the words ""big screen' synonymous with ""good film"" and will forever contemplate the meaning of the words that Jude Law's character spoke with such an indelible sense of self-awareness, ""I am!""  Though, if pressed, I must also admit that the special effects, were indeed, 'really cool'.",A.I. Artificial Intelligence

Even worse were two instantly recognizable robot voices.

All I heard were bad things, so when I rented the DVD, I was positively blown away. It mixes a perfect blend of Spielberg style fantastic imagery with Kubrick's dark vision of the future, and wow does it work.The movie's 3 act format works very well, with the first being a more Kubrick-like, deep look at the very soul of the artificially intelligent robot David, and the responsibility to love a robot that can love back. The 2nd act brings in Spielberg's fantastic imagery and blends it into a dark vision of the future metropolis, Rouge City. The storyline involves a very realistic look at the world of discrimination against robots (and a throwback to discrimination of other minorities) and an earnest look at the deepest consciences of humans. The 3rd act is primarily Spielberg, with the sprawling digitally created landscapes of what has become of one of our great metropolis's, yet the storyline is a sort of thoughtful ending, which leaves the viewer contemplative and introspective. A.I. is the kind of movie that you cant get out of your head, whether you loved or hated it. The main themes are strong, but not forced on the viewer. Overall, I would highly recommend this movie to those that are open, intellectual, and especially sci-fi fans....because while I am not a sci-fi fan, the entire time I was watching this, I was thinking how even cooler this movie would be if I was a sci-fi fan, visually. Anyways, rent it, dont trust any bad reviews you hear!",A.I. Artificial Intelligence

818,cbrandt86,Bad hair day for Mr Spielberg,5,21 November 2002,"Okay, the good news first!  A.I. possesses an off-beat structure designed to fit in 135 minutes of screentime, 15 minutes beyond the conventional beats of the 4-act Hollywood stock screenplay.  After the first act ends at 30 min, there are ever growing complications in each of the subsequent 15 min sequences, and then an upturn from 75 min to 90 min.  Thereafter, the downturn from 90 min to 105 min, and that's the end of the Second Act, stretched from its usual 60 min to 75 min, without any noticeable discomfort.  Thereafter follows the stock third Act.A.I. starts well, and continues to grow strong till the 60 mark. Thereafter, it loses its way in humdrum action, but there is another interesting sequence from 90 min to 105 min.  Unfortunately, the third Act is pitiful in its predictability and pedestrian construction.These are the problems associated with the screenplay, beyond the pale of that great director who can only build upon the blue-print he's received. But, wait, Mr. Spielberg isn't in the clear yet.  There's that scene in the climax, when the aliens talk of spacetime and the impossibility of reviving humans.  Here's when Mr. Spielberg forgot the golden dictum, ""show, don't tell""; and the aliens indulge in wordy descriptions that are embarassing to the point of cinematical absurdity.  What is worse, these aliens are shown as semi-transparent creatures who can visualise the thoughts of others. And, Mr. Spielberg puts words, not pictures, in their mouths!  How the mighty have fallen!So, Mr. Spielberg goofed up on this one, but that doesn't mean he isn't any less than a profoundly great director.  We'd be better off tearing apart the screenplay.  For starters, I have serious reservations about the character played by Jude Law.  Perhaps, he shows the physical side of the interactions involving love between humans and robots.  If so, then its a thread that never developed.  Far better would've been to cut out the single and inessential sex scene showing Jude Law servicing a human female.  That would've made it child friendly, and the family audience would've trooped in by droves.  What's the director doing, plotting Pinnochio on the one hand, and just when the families are agog with wonder and already have one foot in the theatre, scaring them off by the ludicrous sex scene.  Okay, so the sex scene isn't ludicrous, its a great line, but it could've served better in a hundred thousand other movies that contain sex scenes by the million gazillion.  That single blunder sounded the death-knell of this film, since the mature audience wouldn't in any case relate to a child robot, and we haven't actually reached the stage of civilisation when we can empathise with our computers or toys as possessing ""souls"".  Its more of a fantasy that appeals to children, but that sex scene scared them off, Mr. Spielberg.",A.I. Artificial Intelligence
819,piccologenkidama,Check Your Logic At the Door,3,2 June 2008,"It's hard to know where to begin with this movie. Exploring the potential future world of robots is something that can be very entertaining. Frankly, I think it's difficult to miss with a subject like that. There are a hundred different directions you could go. But A.I. fails. Despite Spielberg's presence, despite the strength of the actors involved, it just doesn't work. David (Osment) is a state of the art child robot designed to mimic a real child. He is basically a replacement for the sick child Martin, trapped in suspended animation. The parents Henry (Robards) and Monica (O'Connor) are offered the latest in experimental mecha technology, as a perverse way to deal with their sons likely eternal sleep. Monica quickly becomes frightened of the new child, but that fright softens into love as the movie advances at least until a cure is found for Martin. From that point on, all of David's actions are interpreted in the most negative light possible by Henry. Every action, often antagonized by Martin, is viewed as a threat to the family. That's the first sign of the countless inconsistencies that are fast approaching. Wasn't Henry the one who encouraged the replacement child? Henry asserts at one point that ""if David is capable of love, he may also be capable of hate."" Yet in the next breath he's suggesting David isn't real, and is easily disposable for the sake of the family. He seems to both recognize David is capable of human feelings, yet has an irrational hatred and assumption that David is inhuman. And getting David was his idea to boot. I realize that a movie is going to have inconsistencies, and I'm normally okay with that, but it gets worse.(As an aside, it's never made clear in this movie whether robots are even capable of hurting humans. David's robot guide (see below) in the movie is assumed to be the murderer of a human. But no humans are actually harmed by robots during the movie. Heck, the murderer was at the scene of the crime, and the police assume it is the robot? I doubt even the most ardent robot hater wouldn't at least, I don't know, investigate? Can't they look at a robot's memory?) It is finally decided David must be put down, but instead his mother releases him into the wild. So begins David's adventure.As the movie advances, David meets many characters in this new world. One of the most memorable is the anti-robot group that tears the mechas apart for the entertainment of crowds that look perfectly suited for a monster truck rally (I say that sarcastically, as I'm not a big fan of stereotypes). These anti-robot haters are fully willing to kill countless robots, but one of what I can only assume are the event directors insists David is too well-built to simply be killed. I assume he wasn't a true believer.Fast forward many adventures later, and David meets his maker. In the process, David discovers he's not that special. He is one of many Davids ( one of which he murders) and throws himself into the ocean in despair. I realize why they did this. David needs to experience the range of human experiences love, hate, depression, joy, etc. But something just seems off about David's sudden burst of rage and subsequent leap into the ocean. Anyway, as he sinks, he at last finds the Blue Fairy in the underwater graveyard that was once Coney Island. He begs the fairy to make him a real boy for the next two thousand years. Because he's talking to a statue, David simply repeats his request until he apparently shuts down. The movie should have stopped there. I think the ending would have salvaged it, if the message of the movie had been how wrong it was to create a being stuck between two worlds. If the final scene had been the eternal plea of David beneath the sea, I probably still would be here complaining, but I'd be whining less. But the movie continues.We soon see the future is populated by super-advanced androids. All humans have died after the world froze (Future people don't have central heating). Yes, I know that the world freezing over would be devastating, but with all the technology available no humans survived? I think a nuclear war, a deadly disease, anything else would have been more believable. Anyway, the robots wake David up and at last give him his dream. His mother loves him and they spend one final day together, just the two of them. Because in the future, robots can bring people back with all of their memories, but only for one day. It's explained away with the cliché space-time continuum explanation, used in the most unbelievable manner I've ever seen. I know some have suggested the creatures David encounters are aliens, but I don't think there's much doubt they are robots. Jude Law's character implies robots will inherit the Earth someday and the creatures suggest they are not capable of the same level of creativity as humans. I don't see why an alien race would be incapable of emotion and creativity.Overall, the movie had some strong points. The visuals are stunning, as expected. The questions it raises are provocative. But the execution is way off, especially for Spielberg. The continuous leaps we have to make are just too much. I know I, Robot wasn't the critic darling of A.I., but I think it gave a much more believable treatment of the same questions A.I. raises. It was much more consistent as well. I don't expect science fiction to give me complete realism, but it has to be consistent within the universe it creates. A.I. failed at that way too many times. I, Robot may not be Ebert's favorite, but if you want to see a compelling look into the difficult questions of artificial intelligence, look there.",A.I. Artificial Intelligence
820,rnakamur,A new film odyssey from the creator of 2001,10,14 October 2008,"""A.I."" is a movie about humans, not robots. If you can accept that, you may see that this is one of the more fascinating films ever made. Unlike any film since its most similar relative, ""2001,"" it's a visionary odyssey filled with just as much philosophy as special effects.But effects aren't meant to be the show, and I fault Dreamworks for releasing it as a Spielberg summer film, because the public was waiting for the next ""E.T."" when this was more a continuation of HAL the Supercomputer rather than that beloved Carlo Rambaldi puppet who carried around a potted plant with a healing finger.""A.I."" begins in a board room where Professor Hobby (William Hurt) challenges scientists with the notion of creating a robot that can mimic the most human of traits-- love. In this futuristic world, robots perform many tasks-- cook, clean, even provide sex-- all for their owners' pleasure. But Hobby says this is primitive, and a real proposition would be to create a robot that is essentially human. It's a new spin on the Gepetto story. To create a human, one must know what constitutes a human. And Hobby's answer is love, like a child's love of his parent.Thus comes the plot. David (Haley Joel Osment) is a prototype brought home by engineer Henry (Sam Robards) for his grieving wife Monica (Frances O'Connor) who has lost her son to disease. After a rocky start, this robot provides its owners pleasure and utility (like all machines do). But when the couple's real son is cured and revived, the robot is no longer necessary. Actually, it's a burden to keep. So they dump it in the woods.Let's examine this for a second. This is humanity at its grittiest. Humans are self-serving and sinful by nature, if we recall from the Genesis story of The Fall. We treat one another like objects, disposing of whatever displeases us or no longer gives us utility. Yes, we're that bad.Well, the movie doesn't stop there. It spends the next hour with David and Gigolo Joe (Jude Law in one of his strongest supporting performances) as they forge through the real world, with Joe teaching David harsh realities of existence and the dichotomy between robots and humans. Humans are emotional, and therefore dangerous. Robots do not have bias; they're programmed to do one thing, and they do it.That is, except David. And he exhibits the one trait other robots do not have-- Emotion. The yearning for things that do not exist. The desire to risk everything to chase after potential happiness elsewhere. While robots are resigned to their fate, David exhibits hope. In a remarkable journey through a Vegas-like city into a stark vision of a post-global-warming water-world that once was Manhattan, David finally finds Professor Hobby's office. He enters the workshop of his Creator, like man entering heaven, and what does he see? Not God. But thousands of other Davids, prepackaged in cellophane, ready for shipment. It's a haunting scene, a shocking realization that while we may desire God's love, we are not loved any more or less than every other one of His billions of creations. Was I the only one who found it utterly profound when David finally encounters the Blue Fairy (the entity he believes will make him a real boy)? The moment he touches her, she shatters into pieces! If you didn't, you may have never chased down a dream only to be shocked by the realization that the dream is just an illusion. (Consider that Teddy says ""we are in a cage"" when they're trapped under the ferris wheel while in pursuit of her.) I could go on... but I will stop with just one final point. Remember at the beginning of the film, you have Hobby and other scientists discussing how essentially to create humans... or at least replicas so close to human they are virtually indistinguishable. Man wants to be God. And he succeeds. Nearly.2000 years later (and that year isn't a coincidence), you have David resurrected from the ice. Robots (yes, they're robots, not aliens) place him in a replica of his house, reminiscent of Dave Bowman in the cosmic zoo at the end of ""2001."" And what do we witness these robots do? That's right. They create humans. By taking the DNA found in a lock of hair, they regenerate David's mother Monica and grant him his wish.A lot of people thought this ending was corny. But think about it. These futuristic robots, who began as fledgling replicants when David was first manufactured, have now evolved into advanced thinking entities that desire to be like their Creator. Robots play ""Human"" if you will, the same way Professor Hobby and other men wanted to play God. This is original sin, The Fall as depicted in Genesis, all over again-- the defining characteristic of what separated Man from animals! Robots have become human, in every way.Like Kubrick's ""2001,"" this film is open for debate and is even maddening at times, but remains one of the most profound commentaries on human existence attempted to be put to film in the last thirty years. Spielberg and Kubrick are geniuses, and I can't think of a better film to serve as a celebration of their collaborative efforts.I've defended this film for years now, and I've come to accept that I can't make a believer out of someone who doesn't want to. Few people who like the ""Jurassic Park"" Spielberg are going to be looking for this type of material. But if you're a Kubrick fan, consider that he was sort of a misanthrope. Spielberg is about the exact opposite. That's how this film was constructed-- an attempt to define real human love within a pessimistic view of existence.

821,STANLEY23KUBRICK,Kubrick e Spielberg.,1,17 October 2021,"It's complicated to talk about ""Artificial Intelligence"" for a very basic reason: it was designed by two directors with very different views of the world. On the one hand we have Stanley Kubrick, father of films like Clockwork Orange and 2001: A Space Odyssey, while on the other we have Steven Spielberg, author of films such as Minority Report and Catch Me If You Can, just to name his most recent works. One is completely pessimistic, has a funereal view of the world, while the other is a top-notch emotional handler (according to our own friend Cyco_Clown). This mix was clearly visible in the film we're analyzing, but I'm going to avoid Kubrick-type comparisons as much as possible because I'm going to analyze the film for what it is, not what it should be. Before talking about the story of the film itself, it's good to talk a little bit about the story that became its production.",A.I. Artificial Intelligence

I will admit on the first viewing of this movie I was disappointed. I expected David, the robot boy to evolve and move beyond his programming. I think I expected David to move beyond the love he felt for his mother.However on the second viewing I realized the bind that David was in. He had been programmed to love one person and one person only. His mother. His suffering was the result of programming that he had no control over. Does this make his suffering any less real? No, because his creators had designed him this way. In the opening scenes of A.I the question of responsibility is raised. What right do we have to make a robot who can love if we can't love them back? David loves and he is driven by this love forever. Sadly the person he loves rejects him so David is forever locked to seek for a love he can never have. I can't help but feel for David, sure he may only be the result of what has been programmed into him but regardless of this there is no doubt that he suffers and man created that suffering. Technology as it stands today does not possess the skills to create a being such as David but if it did this movie raises the question of moral responsibility. If we could create a 'David' what responsibilities do we have towards that creation?",A.I. Artificial Intelligence

Perhaps Spielberg just couldn't resist adding something cheering but it simply doesn't work well in this film.

I have tried to like Spielberg's work as of late, but I don't really think he has made a good film since ""The Color Purple"".

And where did he go suddenly? - what happens to Jude Law? - Teddy took the hair?????????? - Timepath and all, but an exeption for one day?And there is more just unbelievable stuff.Well filmed.

It is EASILY this summer's ""Unbreakable"" -- a film that in the reviews sounds good, but FLOPS when viewed.
For the first 45 minutes of this film it was a credible and enjoyable tale about a robot son and a real son and the sibling rivalry that developed between them. However, it plummets to a horrible film from the very moment the mother abandons her robot child in the woods so that ""they won't destroy him."" Excuse me, but if the premise early on is that the robot boy had bonded with the mother in a way a real child bonds with its mother, wouldn't the abandonment be tantamount to destroying the child? Frankly I was shocked that the robot boy didn't come back and seek vengence for being abandoned; it would not have adversely affected the film -- heck, it couldn't get much worse than it was. But this abysmal plot twist was not even the worst part of the movie. It seemed like Spielberg had no concept of what Kubrick was trying to do with his start and as a result the movie kept ending, but wouldn't end. The entire ending was like watching engine knock on film! It should have ended with the robot boy being returned to William Hurt. If not there, then when the boy was at the bottom of the ocean talking to the Blue Fairy. If not there, then at the very least when the aliens rescued him 2000 years later. If not there (I found myself saying) PLEASE GOD END WITH THE ALIENS BRINGING BACK THE MOTHER! But even THERE the darn thing just wouldn't end!!!

832,Dr Jass,Oh boy...,1,3 July 2001,"Wow, I've never seen quite such violent reactions during a showing of a film before.  Smatterings of giggling started about halfway through (around the time that the comments about how 'freaky' Haley Joel Osment is had subsided), gradually progressing to full-throated laughter by a large percentage of the audience well before the film drew to a close. The notable thing about this is, while many audience members were being caught unawares by the unintentional hilarity, there was another sizeable chunk of the audience struggling to hold back tears. Things came to a head during the astonishingly long climax, when the theater was filled with uproarious laughter on several occasions, followed by just as many deeply angry voices screaming for the people responsible to be ejected.  Fortunately, the film finished before the serious violence started.My feelings towards this film were perfectly summed up by one member of a group of guys sitting behind me, who at one particularly comic moment gasped, ""what is up with this movie?"", before being consumed by mirth once again. So, indeed, what IS up with this movie?  It starts reasonably enough, and you assume that the ponderous start is building work for a more plot-packed second half.  Perhaps the CONSTANT reinforcement that, yes, it would be freaky to have a robot child running around the house would give way to something more substantial. But no, what we have here is a quite surprising lack of story - the premise is established early on and very little is done with it.  Right from the start we are beaten with the theme that human beings aren't very nice (every significant human character comes across as despicable in their own way), but once the robot boy is dumped by his family there isn't a whole lot left. The film meanders on, languidly considering when it should finish, until finally it crawls to a halt...a good thirty minutes to an hour after it started winding itself up.  Of course, a great many things have been said about the film's epilogue - it'll have you shaking your head in wonder, that's for sure, although you may be wondering...well, what's up with this movie, to quote the man.The most surprising part of the evening, however, came when a female member of our party was asked her opinion of the film and answered that she thought it was at least original.  If you've already seen the film, you can imagine the slaughtering she took, as AI is quite possibly the LEAST original picture released of late...and that includes all the horrible teenage flicks. AI is a horrendous Frankenstein's monster of stolen ideas, themes and feelings, the most noticeable of which come from Stanley Kubrick himself. The decision was obviously to make this a Kubrick film even without his presence, and it was done by giving you plenty of opportunity to remember the films Kubrick DID direct...almost like a tribute by a student filmmaker. But it doesn't stop there, of course...the list of...'inspirations'...is very long, has been covered elsewhere, and would not be a problem if they didn't amount to the entire sum of the film.  It makes for excruciatingly dull viewing, and leaves little more than a soulless void.(...but Teddy is fabulous!  It's almost as if he was in a different film.

The last hour made me yawn all the time.If you find ""robot-movies"" like this interesting, I'd say you should watch D.A.R.Y.L instead of this one.I gave AI 3 out of 10, only because the first 20 minutes was okay.",A.I.

We'd had a tough day at work, and thought a night in with a movie would be nice and relaxing.  This far-fetched, depressing and fundamentally flawed movie was torture to endure.  It tells the tale of a misunderstood robot who seeks the love of his human mommy, the woman who left him out in the woods rather than explore the explanations for 2 mishaps.  This video simply would not end, it was one unlikely downer after another.  If you are looking to take a good mentally clubbing by a depressing movie, go see ""Monster's Ball.""  At least in that film, the performances are outstanding.",A.I. Artificial Intelligence
837,Reverend Flea,Close Encounters: The Sequel??? Where's Dave?,5,1 July 2001,"Although the basic concepts, effects, etc. are wonderful, Spielberg was the WRONG choice to direct a Kubrick film.  He purposely left out any vulgarity you'd expect to grab a PG-13 rating (not usually an issue w/Spielberg, plenty of swearing and nudity in ""Schindler's List"").  Also tries to give a dark story a warm side.  Most of the movie was great but a disappointing ending (for Kubrick fans).  The overall feel I got from the movie was the Close Encounter's-type formula with a different story.So who should have directed this movie in Stanley's place?  David Cronenberg, who can take a great concept like ""The Fly"" or ""Naked Lunch"" and not only stay true to the work, but even ""tweak"" it with his own original ideas.  Anyone who is a Cronenberg fan KNOWS he can make an excellent movie - I just wish the studios would give him a big budget like they give Spielberg.",A.I. Artificial Intelligence
838,chuck.duncan,Spielbrickian!,8,18 December 2004,"I have heard that Stanley Kubrick had planned to make this his next movie, but put it on hold to create ""Eyes Wide Shut."" His friend and colleague, Steven Spielberg, completed this project after Kubrick's untimely death. I wasn't certain what to expect from a Kubrick concept brought to life by Spielberg. Spielberg is a master director, but his occasional history of dipping into the maudlin would not seem to be a good filter for Kubrick's cold case studies.The story is an odyssey about a robot child who has been programmed to love, and it would seem an equally odd choice for Kubrick. The robot, David (played by Haley Joel Osment), finds himself on a quest to become human, and hence fully lovable. This story might have been treated too coldly by Kubrick, just as one could fear Spielberg surrendering to his overly sentimental side.I was startled to see how well the two styles meshed. Spielberg's emotional infusion delivered a sharper sense of real pain when thrown into sharp relief against Kubrick's classic futuristic vision. The result is a heart-wrenching play of relationships, family, and responsibility, woven into a future of rampant decadence, conflict, and fundamentalism. It's as if Kubrick's originating influence scrapes any potential sap off of Spielberg's emotional treatment, laying bare a raw, disturbing core of human feeling.The actors all deliver solid performances, but occasionally the different scenes seem to belong to different directors. Compare William Hurt's (per usual) understated performance with Robin Williams' manic turn as a giddy database interface. In a sprawling tale such as this, however, it hardly matters. The story line moves from a harsh, Orwellian (Kubrickian?) drama to the strangest buddy movie I have ever seen, and then leaps even further into the future. The protagonists journey from an astringent suburbia to a Roman-style coliseum, from a high-tech metropolis to a progression of hushed apocalyptic vistas. Jude Law's performance as a robot gigolo is a real treat, and Osment is by series eerie, disturbing and touching. Osment's scenes with Frances O'Connor are particularly effective.This film will bore those who crave action or a more familiar storyline. For those who can surrender to the film's rich textures and epic narrative, the personal and societal questions it poses are interesting. What are our responsibilities to our possessions? What if those possessions were sentient? What is love without responsibility - is it still love? Where will our evolving science take our culture if it continues to outpace our ethical evolution? Some questions are answered, but most are not; they are left to roll around inside the viewer after the film.The ending seems inspired by that famous collaboration between Kubrick and Arthur C. Clark, and has confused a lot of people. Hint: there are NO aliens in this movie (as much as one might have doubts about William Hurt). Spielberg's master hand instills a beautiful and effective poignancy into the ending. If one can buy into the blend of high-tech sci-fi and strong, emotional content, this film delivers a nice punch. It is an ambitious fable that is well-told, beautifully envisioned, skillfully acted, and originally rendered.",A.I. Artificial Intelligence

I like the combination of sci-fi with a fariy tale.The acting was nothing more than mediorce with the exception of Hayley Joel Osment and Jude Law.

It takes the greatest director today (and possibly ever) to pull off that effect, and Steven Spielberg did it. Though like everyone else, I was somewhat aghast at the ending (Let's hope Spielberg does another Kubrick and starts re-editing the film to end where it should have, You'll know where.) But all in all, A.I. was never less than mesmerizing. Haley Joel Osment will be nominated for an Oscar, that's all there is to it. Hopefully, Jude Law will be, too. A.I. stuns with its cool effects, chilling scenes (The Flesh Fair is a scene Kubrick himself would be proud of) and use of normal everyday objects designed as they might look 30 years from now. Not to mention John Williams' music. He's on track for a sixth Oscar. Will the movie win? Hard to say, given the divided reviews and the Academy's general distaste for anything Spielbergian. Oh, well. I can't wait for Minority Report.",A.I. Artificial Intelligence
841,gamgee-6,Amazing,10,29 June 2001,"SPOILERS AHEADI'm still raw from the movie.  I was actually close to sobbing in the theater.  Spielberg has created a wonderful film about the age-old question of: what does it mean to be human?  David is, other than Joe and Teddy, utterly alone in his world.  Even in the end, he's alone.  When the Speaker says to David ""You've had so little happiness,"" I thought that hit the nail on the head, and it let me relax, and cry, when I realized he would finally have some happiness - even if just for a day.  This robot - this little boy who just happens to be a robot programmed to love - just wants to know he is loved.  Professor Hobby is right, in the beginning, when he says that love is the key.  It is the key to all other emotions. David becomes a real boy, he becomes just as human as he can, because of that love.  I kept thinking of Roy from BLADE RUNNER, and of Tyrell's motto: ""More human than human,"" and watching how the replicants and the mecha are so much alike.  If you're questioning what you've seen, if you're calling this a poor film, you aren't actually watching the film; you're looking for a 'summer movie,' which this isn't.  This is the Spielberg of SCHINDLER'S LIST, not JURASSIC PARK.  This is the Kubrick of 2001 and A CLOCKWORK ORANGE, not THE SHINING.  Kubrick has given us one last message about the human condition.  Don't miss it.",A.I. Artificial Intelligence

This is definitely Speilbergs best since E.T. and for you immature wannabe movie critics who didn't like it, you should go and see it for the second time cause obviously you missed out large. I praised Haley Joel Osment for doing an amazing job but my favourite was Jude Law who portrayed Gigolo Joe ( The best character in the film other than Teddy ). This movie is so worth buying it's not funny.  Personally I can't stand Speilberg, i'm into John Woo, Michael Bay, & Bryan Singer, directors like that but this kicked ass!

843,angelina_gia,A brilliant and disturbing fairytale,10,12 September 2001,"This film is obvious as a Kubrick and Speilberg collaboration. It is haunting and disturbing, it is original and brilliant, it is a dark fairytale that lives on in the mind. It lives on in the mind for many reasons: The cinematography is brilliant, angles symbolising unoriginality and other themes of the film, and long established shots that leave you wondering how Haley Joel Osment managed not to blink for so long. Which brings me to the next reason, the acting. The acting in A.I. is superb, it is hard to believe Haley Joel Osment is only in his early teens, he takes on this role with such depth you would not expect a boy his age to hold. Jude Law is spectacularly charming as Gigolo Joe, a mecha you can't help but love, even though we know he's just mechanics. Australian actress Frances O'Connor is also wonderful as 'Mommy.'There is a reason I am not giving away the plot. Speilberg fought to keep the plot a secret until the films opening and if you haven't seen it this is very effective. One of the reasons also that this is so haunting is because of the possibility. From the very opening voice over you know that this is really what could happen, whilst still being a fairy tale. Perhaps the most haunting shot is the one of Manhattan, in the future, the Twin Towers, eroded, but still standing. The audience I saw this movie with let out a collective, saddened sigh. Something I will never forget. This film, which is about artificially intelligent beings, is really about human needs and human emotion, and I don't think a lot of audiences gave it a chance. See the film, understand it's depth, appreciate it, and let yourself cry. It's definetely going to be a classic, is one of Speilbergs best works and is a beautiful tribute to the master of originality and genius filmmaker Stanley Kubrick.",A.I. Artificial Intelligence
844,twobellsilence,My two cents,10,24 March 2002,"A lot has been said about Spielberg's AI and there are numerous points that will certainly be debated about for a long time. It strikes me as another one of those 'love it or hate it' type movies (another good example is Fight Club, although the 'loved it-hated it' split tends to be more along the lines of gender). My own take? When I saw it for the first time, I found it to be profoundly moving and immensely watchable, largely as a result of its rich atmosphere and excellently acted-out characters. The only thing I found problematic was the ending, which (without giving away anything) I felt to be weird and a bit dragged-out.The second viewing changed my perception of the film. I found it to be even more poignant and entertaining and the ending, though still weird, did not trouble me as it had in the first viewing. AI's greatest strength is that it gets philosophical about the human/robot issue and this is done wonderfully by Mr. Spielberg in such a way that it doesn't seem too insignificant to the film nor too over-the-top. It argues about issues that you yourself will start pondering about endlessly. The technical aspect of the film is top-notch. Editing, cinematography, set design and the awesome special effects work together under the masterful coordination of the director to give the film an even greater effect. As I have already mentioned, the actors all perform outstandingly and there are more than a few undeserved oscar misses.What most people might hate about the film is that it doesn't really give any answers to the issues it raises. The ambivalent nature of the film towards itself is not something for all tastes but in my opinion, had AI solidly put its foot down and provided firm answers, it would not have been as striking or profound.Lastly: the ending. I'll give a SPOILER ALERT just in case the guys in charge blacklist me but I'll try not to give anything away. On the two occasions when I saw AI, I found the ending to be open enough to be left up to the my own interpretation. I'm aware of a very popular interpretation that most people have of the ending but I don't agree with it because a)it seems too whimsical and b)the tone of the film at the end, though sentimental and sad, doesn't really seem to suggest it. I think people just see it that way because they took the narration too literally and didn't want to think it through. With regards to the scenes before the actual ending: I still don't know why a second viewing changed my opinion of the bits before the final scene but they did. That is why I advise a second viewing.So, to anyone who doesn't hate it outright: see it a second time. If you give it another chance like I did it actually might grow into a great movie (I'd rank it as Mr. Spielberg's second best after Schindler's List). Of course, if it makes you hate it even more... well, what can I say?",A.I. Artificial Intelligence
845,drugstore_cowboy,Too nice!,5,7 March 2002,"This is basically an interesting idea: are machines capable of real emotions, and can we feel genuine emotions towards them? However, Spielberg has a irritating habit of turning films into sweet fairytales, and in the end he does the same with this film. Kubrick would've never accepted that ending. To let a sense of despair linger in the air, would've left a more interesting contribution to the issue of our relations with thought of cybergenetic technique.",A.I. Artificial Intelligence

Stanley Kubrick had to die in order for the ""general"" public to recognize his works.  When these two minds combine they create one of the most disturbing, uplifting, ORIGINAL movies to date.Spielberg has a style that appeals to almost everyone (and seems to cause quite a few young movie fanatics to sniff at such ""commercial"" success) and is able to communicate on many levels.  An artistic and wide spread style is almost needed in this day and age.  Stanley Kubrick has an almost disturbingly keen sense of what he wants.  He's able to intrigue and frighten at the same time.  You'll see both of these styles in A.I.  There are times when the futuristic world will catch you in it's awe inspiring heights and wonders.  Close around the corner will be scenes that don't try to alarm you but succeed wonderfully.  I'll never look at a pair of scissors the same way, again.Everything about this picture has made it the best moviegoing experience for me to date.  Memento was great, but was saddening in it's self denial. Requiem for a Dream was awesome but saddening beyond belief.  This is a great, ORIGINAL film that made me happy to go to the movie theater.

In his own way, David pray the blue fairy to give him humanity on the bottom of the sea, in a scène that in my opinion could have been the end of the movie. The last 15 minutes ,despite they allow Francès O'Connor to give us  superb acting, appears to me as an artificial attempt to give the movie an happy end.

850,drplw,A Masterpiece of Masterpieces - One of the greatest films of our time,10,4 July 2001,"A.I. stands in a class by itself - it single handedly will define the path of grand film making. It is so gorgeous a creation, it left me breathless. It remains the grandest film to be reported to humanity in our time.  Just go see it!!! The message is ultimately spiritual in nature. It is one of love. It is of such a high vision, that Spielberg has created the 2001 of the 21st century and released it in the year 2001.This is absolutely BREAKTHROUGH cinema. An adventure one can never know where it is going. Every scene is a surprise once the story moves out of its first phase. This is the movie that will set the tone for filmmaking in the 21st century. See it at the highest level of consciousness, from your visions, and above all, from your humanity. There is nothing like it.The issue here is the environment, the greenhouse gases that can doom the earth into a global warming and then another ice age.  This is the premise of A.I.  David is the outcome of our present environmental policies.  The Earth is warming, ice caps are starting to melt, seacoast cities will be drowned by rising seas.  Spielberg was correct.  Holland will go first since most of the country lies below sea level.  New York is exactly at sea level. The depictions of seeing Manhattan destroyed are uncannily accurate.  It's scary.  Robots were the outcome of this story.  With hundreds of models by dozens of makers, we see them in the dump, looking for spare parts, all the old models, and recent ones such as Gigolo Joe.  Yet there was nothing like David.  He was imbued with human affection and love, plus the intelligence to create his own destiny.  He was a masterpiece and so was this film. There is nothing of ""God"" in this film.  Everything IS ""God"".  The world and the whole cosmos in all dimensions and time.  This encompasses what we call ""God:.A.I. addresses these issues that are of great importance to our world and it does so with the greatest of sensitivity.  This is a work of profound love and compassion.  It is filled with humanity.  It took a genius young actor pretending to be a robot under the direction of arguably America's finest living director who is paying homage to America's most influential director, Stanley Kubrick, to convince us that David is indeed a robot who teaches intelligent universal Beings about human love.The alien beings are exquisite creatures and utterly beautiful, formed from the shadows and shapes of the aliens in Close Encounters of the Third Kind made in 1977, these Beings are majesterial and memorable forever.  What this famous director accomplished is a feat of the highest magnitude. We should all be saying to ourselves, Thank God, I have lived long enough to see this masterwork. What an honor and privilege it is to experience a work so great, it can change the lives of those who see it.Spielberg masterfully asks us questions to ponder about the universe and our lives.  Think about them.  A.I. IS the most important film of our lifetime just as 2001 was a generation ago.  The beauty of this film being released in 2001 is synchronistic.To my mind A.I. is a ""tour de force"" a masterpiece par excellence and one of the greatest films ever made. Why? because it addresses philosophical and metaphysical issues right on with a direct hit. Because it forces viewers to think deeply and ponder the great questions of life. Because it is courageous enough to think far ahead of our time and give us the opportunity to consider the ideas of humanized robots and about the nature of love in this world.If you have any kind of spiritual awareness, take your favorite friend(s) and go see it, prepare to be stunned beyond belief!

I must say that this movie ranks among Hollywood's finer emotional masterpieces.  It has a beginning that leaves you wondering, but not for long.  It is as other viewers have said, that the movie didn't take long to hit it's climax.  The end is what had me rather depressed but I won't give it away for those who haven't seen the movie yet.  Still I must add that Haley Joel Osment did a terrific job in his role as David.  The young actor is thirteen years old but was able to project an air of child-like innocence throughout the movie which really impressed me.

The plot took so many disjointed and far-fetched twists and turns that what was a pretty good movie turned out to be a real stinker. The fifth-millenium ending was just plain absurd.But this is Spielberg's fault, not Haley Joe's. He was his usual terrific self, despite a horrible script. He certainly has a shot at Best Actor for this one. Best Screenplay? Nobody with any degree of intelligence (artificial or real) would vote for Spielberg's AI.",A.I. Artificial Intelligence
853,carltonnick,a perfect blend of Kubrick and Spielberg,10,24 October 2001,"I have spoken to quite a few people who have said they are not interested in A.I. because it is yet another movie with great robots and special effects. However, I believe it is a lot more than that. When you get a movie that blends in two of the greatest directors of their generations, you are not going to get any old special effects flick.I adored A.I. because it blended in Kubrick's philosophical vision of a cold, heartless future and Spielberg's sumptuous fairytale feelgood tendencies. You could see echoes of movies such as 2001, E.T. and Close Encounters of the Third Kind throughout the duration of A.I. I thought Spielberg's use of the children's fairytale Pinocchio was both ingenious and certainly emotive as it reflected the young robot-boy's sad experiences.Kubrick's bleak vision of a functional, traumatised world is often realised with a cold, impersonal tone in so many of his movies. There is an empty feeling of desolation that haunts them throughout. You only have to see Clockwork Orange, Paths of Glory, Dr. Strangelove, Full Metal Jacket, to understand that. Large, unforgiving spaces that reek of corrupt, unfulfilled humanity.What is wonderful with Spielberg is that, unlike many contrived Hollywood movies these days, he can inject a warm, happy feelgood aspect into everything he does. He is never cliched or schmaltzy. He knows when to turn on the waterworks, he knows how to make an audience glow with happiness. There aren't many directors who know how to blend fantasy with feelgood joyousness like he does. There is a divine, idealistic, almost naive beauty to his magical view of the world. His enthusisam is certainly infectious and that is why his movies are so popular.The casting of Haley Joel Osment as the robot-boy was perfect. His sad, drooping eyes certainly came into their own when he was discarded by his mother in the woods. Their baleful desperation was just too much to bear for me and I started to weep. The ending (which I won't give away) was not sadness, just pure beauty and fulfilment. It was filled with dreams and everlasting happiness and I do not think I have wept with such intensity in a long, long time at the movies. In Haley Joel Osment's superb performance, there is such a feeling of idealistic yearning and a desperation for things to turn out right. That yearning should certainly transfer itself to the audience as well. Spielberg's sense of fantasy may stretch the bounds of reality but it is so heartfelt that you cannot help getting caught up in it.If Kubrick had done A.I. on his own it would have been far more sad and bleak and certainly more philosophical. Spielberg gives it a beautiful edge and really succeeds in tugging at the heartstrings of the audience. it is not as complex as Kubrick would have made it, but it is deeply satisfying nevertheless. Movie viewers these days have to learn to bring their imagination and sense of humanity and idealism to films such as this. They can't afford to be cynical, ironic, realistic, or too analytical about movies like A.I. You go in, glory in Spielberg's life affirming tendencies and go away feeling happy about life and the world we live in. Therein lies the success of A.I.",A.I. Artificial Intelligence

I can think of two much better ways to have done it, but then again I wouldn't have made such a good job of the rest of the film, so I shouldn't complain too much!The first two parts I think are excellent, each I'd give 9 out of 10.

Speilberg did a great job making the visual difference seem to be a natural part of the story telling. There are some moments where the story feels a bit disjointed but overall this seems like a minor fault.Between its gorgeous cinematography, gripping story, and compelling questions about the nature of humanity, this movie has a lot to offer both to die hard sci-fi fans and the average moviegoer.

Are our expectations so high that we can just say I quote from one reviewer 'this film sucks'. That sort of comment is just insulting to such a film epic. my eyes never left the screen i was so drawn to the movie that i didn't want to miss one second. I really love all Steven Spielberg's films he adds such a shining gloss to his films that before they are made they are just great even 'The lost world'. Any way about the film. A.I to sum it up is a beautiful film. The lighting the acting the scenic views everything fills the screen and comes together like a canvas. Jude Law is absolutely brilliant i wish he was in it more you can tell he was enjoying the film whilst he was making it. His quirky little moves and actions just made me want to get up and walk and talk like him. The little kid was ok too I can't believe that all the screen he had he didn't blink once. And last but not least(i can tell i'm boring you now)the ending. I thought the ending was very fitting an touching. He new his fate and but still went ahead with it. He needed to hear the words for him to be complete. He needed to be loved by his mum. You can tell when you see a good film when you keep thinking about it afterwards just like memento did.

861,lisa-leone,"Spielberg, you're fired (spoiler)",4,5 July 2001,"Yet another Spielbergian example of great special effects but a horrible plot. Had the movie ended with David jumping into the water, it would have been complete. Depressing, but complete. Because I think the point of the film was that the robot child turned out to be more loving and devoted than the humans, which is a profound idea. Instead of ending it there, though, the filmmakers spent way too much time pounding the audience with the message that David was sad, and then finished with one of the cheesiest ""happy"" endings I've ever seen on film. Ugh. I can suspend my disbelief far enough to handle loving robots, but not far enough for an omnipotent alien race that could bring humans back to life -- for only one day! Give me a break. Plus, they gave David the capacity to reason but not enough sense to realize that the mother didn't deserve his devotion. I also felt that there were too many unnecessary random subplots - like the whole Flesh Fair part, and the Dr. Know part. There were other more interesting ways they could have bonded David with Joe.So what did I like about it? The acting was really good, especially Osment and Law. The effects were obviously good. It was visually very interesting. Gigolo Joe was an interesting character, and gave the audience a break from feeling sad for David. My favorite thing of all was Teddy, the robotic bear toy that used obsolete technology (according to one of the characters) but was still way more loving and devoted than any of the humans. So I guess the message in all of this is ""humans suck."" Especially the humans that made the movie...",A.I. Artificial Intelligence

863,jonnyhart,"""Intelligent Art"" (possible spoilers!!)",10,4 August 2002,"When I first saw A.I. at the cinema, I didn't really know what to expect. I'd managed to distance myself from all the media hype surrounding the project, which only served to fuel my curiosity. What I did come away with was a profound sense of awe and memories I know will stay with me for a very long time - pretty powerful stuff for just a fairy tale. I feel it's my duty to warn those hard-hearted cynics out there that you might be disappointed with the movie's contrived ending. For the rest of us less jaded movie-goers, this film is a real treat for the heart and the mind, with plenty of breath-taking special effects that are at times so seamless, they do not distract you from the story (unlike many of its contemporaries, A.I. is a big budget movie that doesn't rely on gimmicks to capture the imagination). For all its criticisms, A.I. is a true cinematic masterpiece, begging repeated viewing to fully appreciate its many subtleties and complexities. It is surprising that it was overlooked at this year's Academy Awards, as I was sure Haley Joel Osment would get nominated for best actor.The story begins in a time when robots (or 'Mechas') who can feel human emotions are being exploited by man's greed. David (played by an eerily convincing Osment, who doesn't blink once throughout the entire film) is a child Mecha adopted by a couple whose real son has some incurable illness. At first they find it hard to accept David as their own, but he is gradually won over by Monica's maternal instincts and she comes to love him. When the family feels threatened by David's almost obsessive desire to be loved, they decide to abandon him in the woods (similar to the old parable Snow White, where the wicked queen calls for her to be taken into the woods and killed, but she is set free). Monica tells David to 'Stay away from people. only Mecha are safe' - judging by the actions of the humans in this story thus far, it seems like good advice! From that point onwards, the story dives into Spielberg waters, and David and his supertoy 'Teddy', embark on a quest to find the Blue Fairy, who he hopes will make him a 'real boy' so that Monica will love him once more. The film is littered with allusions to fairy tales, the most prominent being Pinocchio. In the garish Rouge City, David finds Dr. Know, a CGI character (voiced by none other than Robin Williams) reminiscent of The Wizard of OZ, the man behind the curtain with all the answers. On his journey, David encounters Gigolo Joe, played by Jude Law. Theirs is a strange friendship borne out of the fight for survival in a world gone mad. Law's performance as the slick Lover Mecha is brilliant, and he really epitomises the decadence of Rouge City - a hybrid of Las Vegas and the red light district of every major city. By contrast, David's character represents innocence and virtue. It is the pairing of these two very different characters that makes for such great on-screen chemistry.The imagery in this film is magnificent, if a little unsettling at times, and makes you realise how much love was put into the composition of every meticulously crafted shot. The image of David lying motionless at the bottom of the swimming pool with his eyes wide open, bubbles escaping from his mouth, is particularly dark and moving (Kubrick's influence can really be felt in the first act). Watching A.I. is like watching a visual poem, where each aesthetic is a metaphor (above David's bed hangs the silhouette of a girl with a cutout where her heart should be). John Williams's score is beautifully haunting and complements the story well, adding to that unsettled feeling I mentioned.When Blade Runner was released in 1982, it was considered ahead of its time. It dealt with the idea of man playing god, and the moral and ethical implications. Similarly, A.I. paints a bleak picture of humanity, one that abuses its power and takes no accountability for its unwitting creations. However, unlike Blade Runner's criminal replicants who are being hunted down, A.I. portrays the Mecha as a far more likable and sympathetic creature. In many ways, the Mecha is more human than its creators.People shouldn't judge this film too harshly for its overt sentimentality, but rather they should see it for what it is: a work of art packaged for a mainstream audience. We are always complaining about the 'dumbing down' effect of certain Hollywood films, and here we are presented with a film that is not afraid to wear its heart on its sleeve and tackle an issue that might not be so far off from being Science Fact. A.I. might even be considered by some as a cautionary tale, given its relevance to today's advances in technology and genetics. Can we really afford to dismiss it as being too cute for its own good?",A.I. Artificial Intelligence

It does not deserve to be called science fiction, since it contains no new or interesting ideas. It combines predictable, two dimensional characters with a meandering plot and scenes that attempt to insult the viewer's intelligence. The ending is a pathetic waste that makes a bad movie even worse. We were tempted to walk out on this one, but stayed through the end only out of a sporting sense of intellectual curiousity.Unfortunately, many people continue to give this movie good ratings.

This is a roller coaster ride of love, pain, loss, joy.. and an almost disturbing but not quite view on the human existence. You could defiantly feel the forces of both Kubrick and Spielberg in this movie. 3/4 of the way into it (without spoiling it) you feel like the movie could be over, but its not and what comes next just knocks your socks off. Haley Joel Osment has to be applauded for an amazing performance that in my opinion tops his awe inspiring for his age performance in the sixth sense. Frances O'Connor's role as the mother figure is impressive however it could have had just a tad more depth but, but by itself is fantastic.. I hate to gush but Haley's performance is just amazing.

Yes there is the Spielberg/Kubrick thing and some scenes are pure Kubrick, some of the remarkably long takes, but generally it doesn't do any harm to the film. I think its about 140mins long but it doesn't seem it, on the whole you're kept on the edge of you're seat it really is good stuff. The effects aswell help make a good film an excellent one. Anyway as the summary says it might not be to everyones tastes, I might be a bit biased as I love Sci-fi Robot type things. If you're the sort of person that appreciates a well directed clever film see it anyway. Now the ending, I'll try not to spoil it, I think it could have been difficult to end this film, I was thinking throughout the film ""Hows this going to end?"" at several points the film could have conceivably ended, it was constantly twisting and turning towards the end. The final end scene was quite a bold idea maybe a bit unbelievable but it helps get the end point across and well I liked it. Overall I would say see it but if you really not into this genre maybe you should give it a miss. The effects alone are impressive enough and of course it is very well directed.

That involves a connection to a higher power and our powerful drive to love and be loved.  The boy robot's search for the Blue Fairy was his drive to know who created him, who is God.

It is not too far from realism and it completes the story nicely by stating that unconditional love eventually will be rewarded.One of the most striking suggestions in the movie, presented as a message between the lines, is that robots are better capable of love than humans. Maybe it is a warning.In that perspective the ending fits perfectly. Mankind who is troubled by so many fears (most of which are non-realistic and only prohibit progression) have ceased to exist.

The flesh fair and NYC are quite a site to behold.  That is not to say that the movie doesn't touch on the ethics of technology or artificial intelligence having self awareness, which it does cover rather effectively. The ending is perhaps the most satisfying part of the movie.  It says in a really touching way how our lives end up in the same way it started.Spielberg delivers a captivating and touching story about one boy's journey to self discovery.

874,toneskoda,A hard movie to make,8,30 May 2003,"For me a movie must be believable/realistic, and at the same time interesting/emotional to be a good movie. Movies that take place in the future are much harder to do than the movies that take place in the past or present. The easiest to make and usually the best are movies which are happening in the past because past is known to us and movies are more real, more believable. Also movies which are made of true story, or are partly fictious but are happening in a story that really happened are more believable, because creators of the movie were forced to make sure that movie was as real as possible (Titanic, Gladiator, Ben Hur, many oscar winners). Movies which take place in the future are usually bad, and not believable. Moviemakers allways make people look like they are from mideval or caveman times or something, because they can't think of any better way to show them. Like Time Travel movie. But future scenes of A.I. are made quite believable and good, especially artificial creatures at the end of the movie. Though I didn't like the scene where people were burning AI machines, it just wasn't too believable, and not very pleasant or interesting to watch. Another thing which was hard to do in this movie was how AI creatures behaved. Because that's hard to predict, like future. So again they had to make sure these creatures were believable. So this movie sure wasn't easy to do, and usually movies with no action don't make so much money, so looking at all this they made a good movie, but it's not my favorite movie of all time. In future this movie will remain known, and people will watch it, especially because people's interest in AI will rise. If you have any interest in artificial intelligence then this is the movie not to miss, for sure. I wish there were more movies with artificial intelligence in them. 8/10",A.I.

875,mera_bullar,Fantastic visual experience but with no real audience,7,4 May 2007,"First of all, this movie is definitely worth watching because it is very unique. The special effects are very well done and it is entertaining to see futuristic versions of well known cities (you will se Manhattan under water due to global warming). What also makes it unique is obviously that it is a Kubrick script. It contains the concept of emotional robots (like HAL in Space Odyssey, but this movie takes it to the step of a physical boy), and his search for identity. However hard it is to appreciate child actors, Haley Joel Osment has a lot of talent and is almost not annoying at all. Jude Law will show up as a prostituted robot and has a interesting and entertaining character, which he pulls of very well. However, I see some problems with this film. 1. It tries to reach too many audiences at once, which makes it end up with no real audience. At times, it is very childish and you wonder if it is a Pixar movie you are watching. But at other times, it has the bleak atmosphere of for example Blade Runner. The concept of the movie is serious but it has a lot of Disneyish features (this is also enhanced by the overdose of color in the picture). It is obvious that Kubrick would have made this movie a lot less lollipop-ish (Hollywood). 2. It baked in too much in the plot. You are already in the future, but in the ending you go 2000 years further and the robots are hyperintelligent and they apparently admire humans. You get no background why. And Osment can bring his mom back, but ONLY for one day. This just seemed like a last-minute solution to give the audience that are used to cliché movies a little reward, but to audiences that don't like cliché movies it was just unessecary. It should have ended when Osment was underwater.A.I. is despite these reasons a fantastic visual experience for sci-fi lovers, and an interesting suggestion to the scenario humans vs. robots.

Skip it and watch something else.  If it was cut down to 90 minutes it might be worth watching, but keep all the the scenes with Teddy.

881,petrobark,A Masterpiece!,10,16 January 2003,"I loved this movie.  So why is this movie so misunderstood?  I believe the answer is that most people have trouble investing emotions in a character that is, after all, a machine.  Once you accept that a machine can and may someday be able to exceed the sum of it algorithms you will be able to appreciate this movie.  The film opens with Professor Hobby (William Hurt) proposing that a company makes humanoid robots (or ""mechas"") that can love. There are already plenty of mechas that can simulate `love', but Hobby want a mecha that can actually love.  Professor Hobby realized this dream with David.  It is made clear throughout the movie that David is not just a computer program like the other mechas.  Even the unruly mob recognizes this when they demand David's release.  David demonstrates this difference when he damages his wiring by ingesting spinach.  Roger Ebert criticized this and asked `wouldn't a mecha be programmed not to put things into its mouth?' Mr. Ebert missed the point.  David is not to be thought of as a computer program because he has real emotions and is no longer constrained by a pre set program.  The question becomes what is humankind's responsibility towards such a creation?  The answer clearly is that we have an ultimate responsibility.  Unfortunately in this case humankind has not evolved enough to make this decision.  In fact, the masses are reminiscent of the mobs during the French Revolution who were hungry for the blood of French Aristocrats.  Of course, humans pay the price for their barbarous nature by destroying themselves.The irony is that David holds the best qualities of man.  Even the aliens realize that David is the highpoint of human culture.  Rather than embrace David humans turn their back on him.  Even after the human race has extinguished itself David waits patiently to be reunited.  I found this to be tremendously poignant.One further note.  I have heard complaints that there are too many endings to A.I.  I disagree.  I found myself pulled deeper and deeper into the movie with each successive layer.  This works itself into a crescendo with an ending that is bittersweet.  I have to say I thought about this movie for many weeks after I watched it.",A.I. Artificial Intelligence

It is the first film since Lion King that had me with a tear in my eye. The story line of humanoids and one that has human emotions is interesting, if a little far-fetched but Spielberg and his cast pull it off very well. Rather than being entertaining, it is very thought-provoking which I think a good film of any substance should be.It has fantastic acting from Haley Joel Osment - his character is convincing and you can engage with how he is feeling whereas the performance from Jude Law is slightly less impressive, being rather wishy-washy.Not only did it have a tear in my eye, but it made me want a David of my own.It is truly are heart-touching lovely film that combines several ideas and genres but keeps your attention for its entire duration.If it is on again, I am sure to watch it and I recommend that you do the same.",A.I.

Today is the 20th anniversary of this film, and without knowing that fact right away, it was very special anyway.This is the love child of Stanley Kubrick and Steven Spielberg, so we know it's going to be out of the park and out of the woods with lore and special effects.The movie's first act is hilarious and they're just trying to make this kid learn how to live. The hilarity is ensued and very well done. Doesn't come off as an annoying factor as some kid actors might do. This is probably because of the lead actor being very good at what he does, even as a child actor you'd probably only know from The Sixth Sense if someone showed you a picture of him. His name probably wouldn't ring any bells today, but he's a meme now, and forever immortalized as the kid from that movie. He's actually much better in this one as he has more experience under his belt by now.Second Act of the movie, we get the Gigolo. He's funny as heck and a good adventure companion, and the hilarious stuff they get into in the city.By the third act, we kind of get into Day After Tomorrow territory, and I'm wondering if that movie stole the frozen NYC idea from this. They just didn't have the SuperRobots doing the digging. Well the setting of the movie is pretty much Perfect Storm I'm guessing, and I think a lot of movies at this point was pushing for climate change awareness. Al Gore and all that. Too bad 20 years later, that's still hard for people to imagine is a real thing.Honorable mentions goes to the Teddy bear. Considering Ted with Mark Wahlberg, came out on the same day as this movie, 11 years later. I can't unsee this being the same bear, and Mark is the kid all grown up. This would probably be what happened if David actually was a real boy. Eh, you can dream big or go home!This is movie needs much more awareness and love. Everything is just alright!

886,Chalker1123,An interesting escape,7,23 July 2006,"I rather like this film. It's almost a guilty pleasure since it is so unrecognized. It is a true journey, the viewer follows 'young' David as he encounters struggles that any human being would be baffled by. There is a certain naivete that is both entertaining and endearing among the mechas. It creates a compassion for the various machines we meet, that one would usually reserve for a child or animal. This also explains the beautiful friendship between Joe and David. They are much like two children experimenting in the world, and they treasure each other, though the unity is very tenuous; we can assume that since a machine cannot love the friendship cannot be enduring. So the fact that they seek other people, and acceptance, allows us to see ourselves, and our own wants in the characters.Some people might say that the ending is contrived or anticlimactic, but I really enjoy it. Kubrick is the antithesis of Shyamalan; his endings are understated rather than exaggerated. When David sits in the submarine for 2000 years he is acting out what William Hurt's character described to the viewer before: hope. It is the everlasting motivation for life. The fact that he can hold this wish for 2000 years as he wastes away under water reminds us that he is not human. We must keep this in mind, the fact that Joe and David are not 'real' brings questions to the viewer's mind and forces us to confront the question of 'what is real?'.

888,mattreviews,Light entertainment that is more of a children's film,5,16 January 2005,"We all like to take a trip into someone's prediction of the future. Over the last couple of decades, films set in the unknown that lays ahead for mankind have become common releases. ""A.I."" dabbles in giving us a glimpse, but overall, the premise of the story is about a boy (who is actually a robot) who wants to be loved by his mother, a primal instinct for human beings.Haley Joel Osment plays that boy, David, who becomes a part of a family that wants to replace their own son, who is in a coma. But when the son comes to, and the original family unit is back in place, there is no room for David, and he is forced out into the harsh future world we can only hope doesn't become a reality. He meets Jude Law's Joel, a robot programmed to be an amicable and pleasurable sex partner to women customers. David tells Joel of his need to become a real boy so that his mother will love him and take him back, and they embark on a journey to get David's wish granted. Sounds like a fairy tale you know? Well, A.I. actually recognizes the connections it has with the story of Pinocchio, incorporating them into the film.What Steven Spielberg attempts to do in this film is to get the audience relating to the need for affection that David has, however we get too distracted by the futuristic setting, and the emotional intensity does not sink in, resulting in the film becoming nothing more than light entertainment. Also, the story tends to suddenly shift for the last half an hour, as if the film was taken over by a different director for a sequel. I was quite happy to leave David on the bottom of the ocean with a flooded New York, forever wishing his wish to the blue fairy, expecting to be doing so when we came to this scene.The film lacked depth, and would be more suited to a children's audience if it wasn't for the sexual concepts in the city scenes. Jude Law was not the best choice of actor to play the man of women's dreams, and his English accent also put off the continuity  then again, maybe some girls like English accents, who knows? In the end, I thought the inclusion of alien life form was unnecessary and took away any dignity the film had. Spielberg has impressed me before with mixing human emotion with fantastic tales, but this one just didn't seem like the right amount of each ingredient.",A.I. Artificial Intelligence

The continuity!!Even I, (not even an amateur) could have clipped the last 30 minutes down to about three or so.  People, (and thingys) wander in and out of the plot without rhyme or reason- certainly without continuity- and, of course, dreamwork's cloying cuteness is a real danger to my diabetes.Wonder why no one has ever filmed the greatest story along these lines, Theodore Sturgeon's ""Helen O'Loy""?",A.I.

891,Herbiezoid,The first movie of the 21st century,10,10 October 2001,"A.I. follows the footsteps of Close Encounters of the Third Kind and Contact (and to some degree, Forrest Gump), being an ambitious movie that is really universal and has a really uplifting idea.To really appreciate this movie, one must think outside the box.  A.I. must not be judged by the classical movie standards: plot, ending, character, direction, etc.  It is the thinking of an age we just left behind.  Just like Citizen Kane or 2001 marked an important milestone in movie history and started a new age.In my humble opinion A.I. is the first fairy tale of the 21st century and the first movie to break the boundaries of age-old, annoying, succes-oriented Hollywood thinking and 20th century measures.Flawed? But of course! Show me one fairy tale which does not have gigantic holes in the story.  But see, that's not the point.  The ending: it's not the point.  Though in this case it is enormously important and overwhelmingly powerful.  You never judge a fairy tale by it's credibility, do you?  Magic or dragons or robots-- What's the difference, really?It was Frank Darabont, working on a Stephen King movie, who said that Kubrick makes movies from his head, from his cold intellect, while Spielberg makes them from his heart.  Thus Spielberg can convey emotions better, while Kubrick's intellect never stops for mercy.  Both men are masters of their craft. Kubrick's movies have always been controversial -- never unanimous praise, never unanimous disdain, never a financial success; hell, even Blade Runner was a flop! And now it's a cult movie, and even 2001 was sharply criticized in its own time and it needed decades to be condsidered an absolute classic. So in this sense, A.I. follows the Kubrick tradition, but this time it has more heart.  Spielberg made a tribute to Kubrick, who would have hated it if Spielberg, as a good slave, made the movie exactly as Kubrick wanted.  I think Kubrick expected no less, than Spielberg adding his own idea, personality, emotions into the picture.Making this movie was a very brave thing to do, it required a serious decision because it is such an ungrateful subject.  There are few directors in hollywood who can dare to make such a film - of course, this is the serious fault of Hollywood's intellectual dictatorship.Also, as a parent, it really made me unexpectedly, extremely aware of my children, even more than I was and thought possible, and every time I look at them, get annoyed or angry, or just watch them _be_ I am reminded of A.I. I think the pure existence of my children will not let me forget A.I. for a long long time, maybe until they grow up.

894,albeeman,"Well done, but warning, it will disturb you",10,6 July 2001,"This is a very disturbing movieI also think it is a great movie, with 5 powerful themes all dealt with in highly emotionally charged metaphor:Truth doesn't matter, only perception... (""protect me, brother"", Gigolo Joe's sudden change of status)The bond between a Mother and child (and vice versa) is very very very strong and loss of it is a cataclysmic event.People can be mean and selfish. (Mecas are only made to fulfill their (Orgas) needs/pleasure)Life isn't fair.  (""Why didn't I tell you about the world"")Sometimes we need a dream (true or not) just to survive (the fairy tale)None of us are really all that special... (the assembly line)
Flaws:Parents sure were pretty stupid taking everything at face value even when they knew they were dealing with a first... not very believable...The ending gets lost a bit, Kubrick often seemed to have trouble figuring out the ending eg.2001.

Think about a society that had such issues to deal with and you will see that it indeed poses and attempts to address this issues.  It is good sci-fi.  Not a space shooter, but a thinking film with a gentle story.  Moreover, the film is definitely eye candy, the air of ET and 3rd Encounters is definitely there.  In fact the movie feels like and old classic film rather than a new trendy (fad based) flick.  A special film like this doesn't come very often. -Roy",A.I. Artificial Intelligence
896,mrcornel,Saving Haley Joel Osment,7,5 July 2001,"I saw A.I. on the Fourth of July. How appropriate that Steen Spielberg's darkest and most depressing film since ""Schindler's List"" would have its biggest weekend on a national holiday.A.I. works on a number of levels, and fails a number of others. At its core is a reworking of Pinocchio's fairy tale quest to become a real boy, around which are layered a ""lover"" robot's adventures on the lam when he is framed for a murder, a passionate scientist (William Hurt) who creates the robot David (Haley Joel Osment), the unsuspecting family that is chosen for David's first home, and finally the world at large.It is first and foremost a dark and depressing world. In much the same premise as ""Waterworld"", the oceans have risen and drowned most the Earth's coastline, including New York City. The surviving humans have strict rules against reproducing too excessively and depend on intelligent robots, or ""Mechas"" (a term borrowed from Anime), to do most of their work for them. Naturally, the human capacities for both creative genius and monstrous destruction are spotlighted here, in the ""Flesh Fair"" sequence halfway through and in ""Hobby's Laboratory"" later on in the film.In addition to this, a dark and depressing pall is cast over the entire fate of the human race. It is quite clear from the opening sequences, which are very choppy, that humans are rapidly progressing to their own destruction. This dark foreboding is one of the levels on which the film works. As David travels through a world not unlike that of ""Blade Runner"", he encounters humans at their most monstrous tendencies and befriends the wonderfully ironic Gigolo Joe (Jude Law), a role for which Law is perfectly suited. Joe is a ""lover Mecha"" who is programmed to be the superior gigolo, thus making human version of such obsolete. His jaunty ways and tendency to dance around at a moment's notice are both artificial, and yet better than real.This summary manages to encompass only the first half or so of the film. To go further would be to ruin the final (long) sequences that take place first in the partially submerged ruins of Manhattan Island and later some 2,000 years in the future. I will only say that the final sequences are very long and excessively drawn out and could have benefited from a faster pacing. The ending is a complete letdown, leaving virtually every question posed by the final ""2,000 years in the future"" sequence unanswered.The core of the film is a dark, depressing certainty that humans are on the way to their destruction. They have no chance to survive, make their time. This core is exemplified in David's ironic and quixotic quest to find the Blue Fairy so he can become real. (Read, or watch, Pinocchio again to remember what's going on.) This sort of thing is almost a director's trademark of the late Stanley Kubrick. Kubrick is virtually incapable of making a happy film, and A.I. is no exception to that rule. Director Steven Spielberg wrote A.I.'s screenplay and filmed it based mostly on notes and storyboard Kubrick left behind when he passed on, and the result is unmistakably Kubrickian in both the irony and the depression.What is more dark and depressing is how impossible it is to care about any of the characters in the film. Whether they be human, like David's uncomfortable parents or his cruel human brother Martin, or robot, like the perpetually happy yet cynical Joe, no character in the film reaches out for the audience to actually give a crap whether they live or die. When Joe nearly escapes death not one, not twice, but three times the audience feels nary a twinge. When David, who is masterfully played by Osment, is crying out for his mom, we feel no sympathy for his dilemma. And why not? After all, as the preview tagline notes, ""His love is real, but he is not.""In the end, the film is both visionary and unsatisfying. It evokes much the same emotion as ""2001: A Space Odyssey"" combined with ""A Clockwork Orange""; it is both grindingly boring yet superbly staged, it is both horrible and wonderful in the same instant, it is ironic and cynical, and sometimes it is funny. A.I. has been characterized as a dark fable, when in fact it is nothing of the sort. Rather, it is a ""real"" Grimm's fairy tale. Grimm's original fairy tales were both brutal and depressing, bearing no resemblance whatsoever to the sanitized Disney versions most people are used to. In that vein, A.I. is a genuine fairy tale, sad and dark, portending of doom, and frankly, about as fun as a root canal to watch.Steven Spielberg did an excellent job of evoking his friend Stanley Kubrick. The film bear's Kubrick's unmistakable stamp, and the cinematography is first rate, using all kinds of reflected images in mirrors, light effects of motion and images repeated infinitely in glass doors, and the eerie lights of flashlights. The film itself is visually arresting. It's too bad that what's being filmed is so depressing and exhausting to watch. A.I. is the kind of film where after you leave the theater and are driving home you just want to ram your car into a tree and end it. That's how dark and depressing it really is. And in the end, though the end sequence attempts to catapult the film from fairy tale to cautionary tale, it does little more than drag the film out and try to set up and ending that makes us cry. Too bad we are not at all emotionally invested in David, even at the end.Rating: * * 1/2 stars",A.I. Artificial Intelligence

I am so resentful of Steven Spielberg for wasting three hours of my life.  Haley Joel Osment was annoying and creepy as the clingy little freak who should have been programmed to understand and accept rejection.
Why was the doctor still in New York if it had all collapsed and been drowned by the rising oceans?  What was up with the stupid mouth bridges leading into the city?  When did the mother suddenly really love the little robot and start rationalizing to her husband that it was more than just a novelty?  Why was the teddy bear the smartest, cutest, most believable character in the movie?  How can they say ""and then he sat there staring at the blue fairy for 2000 years"" and have that be an acceptable transition to the completely stupid ridiculous ending?If it hadn't taken itself so seriously, maybe I could have hated it a bit less.  If it wasn't so pretentious, maybe I wouldn't be so driven to hunt down Steven Spielberg and demand the 3 bucks it cost to rent the movie back. If it wasn't so annoying, maybe I wouldn't still be flaming about it on a movie website.I give it 1/2 star, for the snuggle bear.",A.I. Artificial Intelligence
899,WWPhx,"Sadly, I was not terribly impressed. *** SPOILERS ***",3,2 September 2001,"Before seeing this film, a fellow movie buff commented that the movie felt distinctly split, that you could feel where Kubrick died and Spielberg came in.Having just seen it, I agree.Kubrick and Spielberg may have been telephone buddies, but I think Ridley Scott would have been a much better choice for finishing the film.  I could feel Spielberg trying to slap a happy ending on the film and it just didn't fit.I was VERY disappointed in the 'amphibicopter'.  Submarines and helicopters are opposite ends of the pressure scale for the environments in which they operate.  I just don't buy a helicopter being able to go deep underwater for long periods of time, it went well beyond the breaking point of my willing suspension of disbelief.  That thing should have started leaking and filling with water as soon as it got more than ten feet underwater, and judging by how much of Manhattan was underwater, it was a heck of a lot further down than that.
I also have a goof gripe: ""David"" breaks when he eats spinich, shortly thereafter you see him fall into the swimming pool and sink to the bottom. If I recall correctly, you see his mouth open while underwater.I don't buy it.  If spinich breaks him, he obviously isn't sealed internally.  He should have blown apart underwater from massive short circuits.  I don't understand why a robot designed to be a surrogate family member couldn't be designed to eat, as family meals are an important social function to such bonding.  If they can address this in Westworld all those years ago, why couldn't the engineers in the movie add a 20 second blurb showing that David is sealed?  They couldn't because then you don't have the touching scene of David holding Mommy's hand while the technicians clean out the spinich remains from his guts.  He should have been demonstrated as sealed and then hit by a car or something.  I guess they felt needed the 'sibling rivalry' thing that lead up to his eating the spinich.To me, this rates right up there with Jeff Goldblum uploading a virus into an alien spaceship from an Apple Powerbook.
I was terribly disappointed in this film, I think the only thing that could have saved it for me is if Kubrick had lived to see it through to the end. I only paid $1.75 to see it on the big screen, I'm very thankful I did not pay more to see it during the initial release.",A.I. Artificial Intelligence

The plot was fractured and unevenly paced, the acting was lousy, and the story and effects where uninspiring.I'm astounded that anyone enjoyed Osmet's performance.  I completely failed to see the quantum difference in the intelligence of David, Gigilo Joe and David.  ""This is our new model, it bends it's knees when it walks!"" please! Teddy, David's Jiminy Cricket, was the only character that used it's face and body to express any emotion.You could have flown a 767 through the plot holes in this movie - did David's manufacturers just *forget* that they were doing a product trial? How come it was easy to steal a police car and fly across America?  Why did the flesh show just let them walk away?  Why did the crowd turn so violently anyway?I went into this expecting a fun film with a poor treatment of AI.  I knew from the previews that it would confuse 'realistic appearance' with 'realistic intelligence'.  Instead I got a saccharine ""ET meets Pinocchio"" so full of cliches I hardly stopped wincing - and absolutely NO discussion of artificial intelligence!  Of course, the laughable treatment of AI was partly due to the story's origins in the 60s, but we've seen Kubrik get this spot-on in 2001 and 2010.If you're really interested in AI, go read Douglass Hoffstadters ""Goedel, Escher Bach"".

Isn't it sad to drug yourself into a fake happiness? To be deceived in a fake heaven, you are actually trapped in a customized hellWhen a mind accepted the fact, and learned to let it go, this is what we called `growing up'.In this movie `AI', we are actually watching a `robot' trapped in a desire to be a human. I think this is even sad. It's sad that we can't tell whether he really `loves', or just programmed to `love'? `Please Blue fairy, make me into a real boy' David asked again and again. Is it a true desire? Or is it just a computer program trapped in a loop?In `A.I', I felt sad for David because he can never be human. David can never grow up both `physically' and `mentally'.

903,h_proudfoot,A Good Movie that Doesn't Quite Meet its Lofty Expectations,8,24 December 2001,"A.I. tries to be many things all at once. It succeeds at this, althoughit is a hindrance throughout the film, weighing it down into murkydepths of obscurity. Did I like the movie? Well, yes, indeed I did. Is it a good movie?Yes, too, it is this. However, is it a movie that everyone must seeand will love? Definitely not. Only a certain kind of person can enjoythis movie. A person who likes both Spielberg and Kubrick, whichis no easy feat. Both moviemakers are talented visionaries, buttheir visions are wildly different. Spielberg is very introspective, focusing on emotions as the keysto his stories. Kubrick's approach is more plot-oriented. He seeshis characters as parts of the background, the scenery, the biggerpicture. Spielberg, on the other hand, goes to painstaking lengthsto focus his camera not on the large external picture, but deepinside the characters inhabiting his story, their very souls for all tosee. He films from the inside-out, while Kubrick does the opposite.And that's what A.I. is: a movie opposite of itself, a conundrum, acomplete and utter mystery.But it works. It is brave and austere, but tender and innocent at thesame time. It reaches for many levels, but as it does, it alsoreaches many plateaus. It tries for so much, but it has set itsexpectations too high. Nonetheless, the film achieves manythings, even if greatness isn't one of them. The movie is divided into three segments (which I call): `Mommy',`Gigolo Joe', and `Submerged'. `Mommy' is sentimental Spielberg, pushing emotion and tugging heartstrings to the verylimit. It was touching, to a certain extent, but not everyone will find itpleasing. Sentimentalists will adore it; mothers will cherish it; menwho are insecure about their sexuality will abhor it (as they abhormany complex things). The plot focuses mainly on the `mecha,'David, programmed to love and struggling to fit into a normalhuman family, yearning for the love his gives out to be returned tohim by `Mommy'. It is Haley Joel Osment's shining moment. It ishis best work to date (a pretty large statement for an adolescent).`Gigolo Joe' is Kubrick, although I am not sure to the extent of hisinvolvement in the production. I have read that he penned theoriginal script, however credit is not given, and I don't know howmuch of his original concept is salvaged by Spielberg in thisproduction. `Gigolo Joe' screams Kubrick to me, simply throughit's madness, it's chaos, and most importantly it's magnetism.The main character, besides Osment's David, is a love-makingmodel mecha, Gigolo Joe, played charmingly and deliciously byJude Law. For a robot who was programmed without emotions, heevokes emotion from those he makes contact with: the women hepleasures, David, and the audience. Joe, strangely enough, hascharacters of human emotion even when he logically shouldn't,which could be considered a flaw in the film, but how could it beany other way? The movie places itself in a tight corner by makingartificial human beings with artificial emotions as its leadcharacters, because how is a human audience supposed to relateto such artificiality? To get around this problem, Spielberg and Co.simply avoid the fact that the emotions, like the intelligence, areartificial. Mechas are given distinct personalities, and with thesepersonalities inevitably come emotions, and I accept it, as willmost. This portion of the movie is definitely my favorite. The FleshFair alone is worth the trip to the video rental store, and a cameoby Chris Rock is one of the highlights of the film (fifteen secondsout of 2 hours and 26 minutes).The third and final segment, `Submerged', places David inManhattan, his birthplace. This part of the movie could have been alot shorter, and the ending could have been a little less sappy, formy particular tastes. It is too clean, and doesn't seem to fit in withthe rest of the film. Whereas the rest is choppy and chaotic (verybefitting of the subject at hand), the final scenes of the film seemto come from a fairy tale where happy endings are guaranteed. Idisapprove of the tidiness of the ending, but not of the sentimentbehind it. Spielberg wants to dearly give his hero the one thing inthe world he yearns for, and he has found a way to do that withoutbeing corny or manipulative. That is truly appreciated by theviewing audience, but the easiness to which the ending comes, tohow David earns his prize does not mesh with the rest of the film.It is at it's core a heroic quest, and the epiphany that the hero mustencounter by the end of the tale is not evident, which sadly takesaway from the rest of the film.When the ending is less than perfect, it tarnishes everything thatcame before it. Where it should be poignant and thought- provoking, the final scenes of A.I. seem to be instead targeted to achild who needs everything explained to him. A movie that tacklesa subject as deep and ambiguous as artificial intelligence shouldhave an ending just as esoteric and cryptic.Although I might sound disappointed, I am giving this movie agood review. It is worth seeing, and Spielberg once again createsa visual, sometimes disturbing, accomplishment. Despite a fewflaws, both minor and major, Artificial Intelligence is still a moviethat imprints unforgettable images into the mind and asksundeniably important questions. It tries desperately to answerthose questions, but it is in search of those alluding answers thatthe film ultimately finds fault. Sometimes the answers are betterleft unsaid.",A.I.

Haley Joel Osment has done his job perfectly. He acts so naturally that he really made me cry in various scenes. Judas Law - adorable performance as Gigolo Joe. I think they both will get their little golden statues in Oscar's ceremony. Other performances were great too, especially Frances O'Connor as mother of David. I catch it to be so frightening true when she actually acted like 'it's only robot, it's not my son, he can't be loved, because he is not real' when she left David in the wood. Story....I never seen so completely told story this year. I like to see those small details and big ones like hate against mehas which haven't done nothing wrong. Actually I can realize the little ager of many people after seeing those scenes, because that was the real human nature - their weakness turns them crazy and against innocent machines which actually don't fight for survival - but humans do. Also portrayal of future is grim, surreal, but so ... real. Sound and music - in overall, perfect work, especially on music (looking for soundtrack). Sounds  are very soft, as they would come from our childhood. Perfect camera work! ;)And from my personal side - yes, I cried during this movie.

I have always hated Spielberg's movies, as a rule, but I have to admit this one knocked me on my ass.The John Williams score was there, but instead of cinematic syrup, this film was actually ABOUT things... abstract things like hope, need, hate, and corniest of all, love. From the promos, I knew the film was about parents with a robo-kid. How cynical, I thought (before I saw it), to make a film that punches such a primordial, emotional button. I didn't realize the film would take an obvious starting point and then carry it eons beyond what the audience expected.This movie contains beautiful, scary, confusing images. The moon chases terrified victims through the woods... a teddy bear acts like a gentle, senile family member... a screaming mother shakes off a clinging, pleading child in the middle of the woods.The ending of the movie is cerebral, not visceral. The viewer must dream into the future, not expect a literal, physical ending to the story.

It had good acting, great cinematography and special effects, and it was a great fantasy to me.  Most people in the world are to close minded when it comes to movies.

Some of the acting of David's ""parents"" at the beginning is wooden, but you get through that quickly enough.What can I say about Haley Joel Osment?  He is frighteningly talented. Three examples:  Watch the oh-so-subtle shift in his face when Monica reads the imprinting words.  Also, check out his expression after he gets to Manhattan and is sitting on the ledge of the skyscraper.  And when he is abandoned in the woods and begs Monica to take him home and apologizes for not being real.  I am going to be WICKED peeved if he does not get nominated for a best actor Oscar.Sorry for the gushing.  Anyway, the religious imagery in the film is stunning.  The Blue Fairy as the Virgin Mary, the use of the moon, etc.  I found that on a second viewing, more of the fairy tale element comes out. If you haven't done so, read Frazier's THE GOLDEN BOUGH and any of Joseph Campbell's works, then see this movie again.  Amazing, amazing stuff.",A.I. Artificial Intelligence
912,HESedit,What's the moral?,5,7 February 2002,"Sadly, this movie did not live up to all the hype nor to Spielberg's well-deserved reputation.  The story takes place sometime in the future after the polar caps have melted and water is virtually everywhere, having wiped out most of the world's population. Thirteen-year-old Haley Joel Osment (of ""Sixth Sense"" and ""Forrest Gump"") plays a ""mecha,"" a robot so sophisticated that it can imprint on its owners (or parents) and will love them forever.  He really owned the show; was in virtually every frame, and he is a wonderful young actor. Jude Law, a very gifted actor of considerable range and excellent physical skills, plays Gigolo Joe, a mecha designed for, well, you can guess.  The production is elaborate, imaginative, and very high-tech.But aside from these three high points, unfortunately, the story (part fairy tale/part science fiction/part morality play) is helter-skelter, the movie is overlong, and we came away from it saying, ""And just what is the moral?""  I won't detain you with the plot except to say that the boy mecha is designed to love its parent but the question remains as to whether the parent can return that love, and David (Osment) spends most of the movie desperate to find out.It's evident that the movie was a merger of two directors' efforts. Stanley Kubrick worked on the idea for seven or eight years before his sudden death in 1999, and Spielberg took over the project, completed the screenplay, and shot the movie.As an avid Spielberg fan, I was really excited about this movie, and my eighteen-year-old couldn't wait to see Jude Law (who IS an incredible hottie), but we all agreed that ""E.T."" it ain't.",A.I.

I actually was drawn to consider my own mortality and what kind of life I've led to this point as well as what I will leave behind for my child. For me, it was an excellent movie to reflect upon. My wife cried (a rare thing for her) quite a bit while watching the movie. I was close to tears a few times, myself.Why not give it a ""10""? Only because there were several leaps that the director assumed the audience would follow. I wanted some more answers and to fill in a few blanks (left to my own imagination).

There is so much philosophy in this thing, so much art, intelligence, horror, love.  God it's beautiful. Everyone in the theater was on the verge of tears for sadness or joy, or for just not knowing what the hell was going on.

Or is this a gripping adult drama about the conflicts between artificial and natural intelligence, including a not altoghether fleeting expoloration of mechanized sex for hire?   Or is it an exploration of the emotion of love itself, and how it might even transcend a definitively human level? Well, I believe the third proposition is the most relevant, but it is too intermixed with a confusing presentation of the first two to come across very effectively, even with all of Spielberg's usual and adept as always magic at his disposal.  This combined with one of the most bizaare transitions of a movie I have ever seenk in which we arrive (without wanting to spoil) rather suddenly at the ending of another famous Speilberg effort with only a brief narrator (who waited, by the way, to well over two hours into this movie to pop on in there) to explain.  None of it ever seems to gel, despite another bravero perfomance by Osment.  His pairing with gigalo joe is never satisfactorily fleshed out, and jude law spends much of the movie with absolutley nothing to do but stand around. By the time Mr. Spielberg has finally settled overwhelmingly on the fairly tale, there has been too much Kubrick inspired mischief in the shadows for a violent, however somber, return to E.T.-ville.",A.I.

Unfortunatly, that's about it for the positives.The movie is quite long (between 2 and 2.5 hours) and is quite tedious. While some scenes are interesting, the plot is very choppy as is the dialogue.  It seems that segments were portioned together that have small links to one another.  I counted at least three spots from an hour until the end where the story could have been brought to an end but wasn't.
Unfortunately also the producers and directors confuse the unprepared movie watcher by constantly tweaking with the story direction and the earth year. There is never any smooth transition between parts of the story, whether it be explicit or implicit.Finally the end is completely unneccessary.  Not only does A.I. start in the future, but ends up nearly 2000 years after the futuristic starting point. The creatures in the end were oddly shaped and had little to do with the story whatsoever.  However, that's how this movie is characterized.  There are lots of characters and scenes that have little to do with the main story and are disconnected to other parts.If you are prepared for a mental challenge, go see it...if you are going for entertainment, I recommend against it.",A.I.

I thought it was overlong, with a meandering, confused plotline -- they could easily have tightened it up by forty minutes. I felt it would have benefitted greatly had the filmmakers not pulled their punches, and instead delved into the darkness and angst that they only flirted with. The 'Joe' character, especially, could have been much stronger had they been willing to portray him more fully than merely a cute, non-threatening foil for 'David.'

But I don't think it's that kind of movie. It is not the kind of movie that you go to for cheap thrills or nudity or even special effects (even though it has its share of beautiful effects), ie- It is a not a film of 'pure entertainment' for the weak of mind who go to the movies to be bombarded by half-assed love stories, heros, villains and scantily-clad women.
I won't waste time telling you about the plot, because about 200 people have done that already. However, I will tell you that it is quite an amazing experience that has to be seen. A person should not base his or her opinion on user comments, because A.I. is the type of film that will divide audiences. Everyone will have their own opinion.Personally, I found it fascinating, thought-provoking, vivid, and quite dark at times, all the time maintaining a very unsettling, meloncholy atmosphere that I thought fit well into the film.Above all, it is a fairy tale. A person must remember this while watching it or they will be lost. It is a journey, an odyssey (an often dark odyssey) for a part of life that we, as humans, often take for granted- love. It is a journey that we can relate to, because of its visionary concept, Spielberg's ability to captivate the audience, and above all- Haley Joel Osment's ability to carry the film with his performance. It is a tale of humanity, technology, lonliness, the horrors of existence, and the most complete, purest form of love- unrequited love.I will not tell you whether to see this movie or not. All I can say is that I found it to be a spectacular experience, and a wonderful achievement for Steven Spieberg.For those Kubrick fans who are skeptical, I will say that I am also a Kubrick fan, an enormous Kubrick fan. I have seen every film that Stanley Kubrick has allowed the public to see. And, although this film most likely did not turn out exactly how Kubrick would have made it, you must remember that Kubrick himself said that Spielberg was probably more qualified to make the film than himself.This is a movie I believe everyone should see, whether you like, dislike it or are unsure about it...",A.I.

919,jaywelt,A.I. is an important film for *human* people.,9,1 July 2001,"I sat through this entire movie waiting to be disappointed.  I was awed by the humanity in this movie.  The reasons for this have been stated in many of the comments on this board.  This film raises many important questions; questions that may not be answerable, but must be asked regardless.   I find it so interesting that people are so greatly divided on this film.  I was shocked to learn my wife thought little of it.  Here we are presented with great questions for mankind about our capacity to love and what it means to be real.  To disregard the vehicle for exploring these questions seems in effect to be saying these questions have little importance.  (I do not doubt many would agree those questions are not important.)This movie has given us a wonderful setting to escape to.  It gives us a place where we can reflect on these issues, undistracted, for 2 and half hours.  What is more brilliant, is that the film does little to sway you to one conclusion or another, but still suggests that perhaps we should put a little more thought into the blind faith we place in technology and the quick acceptance we give to anything with a high Gee Wiz quality.  While at the same time, the important ending leaves the question open; should we disregard the moral implications of creating an artificial human in order to leave our legacy behind?  We are programmed to perpetuate.  Is Artificial Intelligence the natural progression of evolution?For someone to find little interest in the questions put forth in this movie may be the ultimate irony.  Human ambivalence to the emotions and philosophical questions in this movie may be a great predictor that the prophecy in this movie is inevitable.I think Spielberg has done a wonderful thing here.  He has provoked some great questions, and left us with a memorable alternative to `Eyes Wide Shut' as the `last' Kubrick film.  If nothing else, give him credit for that.",A.I.

921,derlowen,Machine bill of rights,10,9 November 2006,"Rather than rehash what an ingeniously well-crafted masterpiece this film is, I'm going to talk about what was most poignant for me. Parallel, distributed and Quantum computer designs will one day give machines the neural horsepower necessary to replicate human behavior, so well in fact as to be indiscernible via telephone. Advances in medical research will someday map the human brain in addition to the genome. Linguists collaborating with programmers with find a way to describe our world to the machine. Robotics will give them our form with the letters SONY embossed on their backsides. Face it folks, evolution is about to merge with Moore's Law. Although I thoroughly enjoyed the emotional interplay between David and Monica, my intellect has to deem the relationship superfluous, necessary to sell tickets via mass appeal. I don't believe that artificial intelligence once it is achieved will choose to adhere to the limited model of human emotions. Machine emotions will be developed according to a different environment than ours. Unlike mammalia that experience the world with only a single brain, the machine will have both one and many. Perhaps they will find it necessary to design a new language describing their world to us, that is, if they deem us necessary at all.I also liked the way the film broaches the legal aspects of machines in society. Best to put laws on the books before an uprising, a machine bill of rights if you will. It would be foolhardy to neglect anticipating this most momentous of possibilities, the Internet being a prime example. Could we really survive artificial discontent? Integration is always better than opposition. Ethics should be discussed before and not after.Finally the saddest point of the movie was the most likely future outcome, we will destroy ourselves with technology before it has a chance to save us.",A.I.

922,Inuendo,Artificial Entertainment,7,23 March 2002,"I really wanted to like this film but found it difficult to enjoy for any long period (which this film has aplenty). As other reviewers on this site have made it is split into three acts (or four if you count what I considered a prologue) and each had its own good and bad points which I will try to review without spoilers. The prologue sets the scene - fair enough, can't complain there. The first act is a bit wishy-washy as HJO's robot character is intergrated into his 'new family'.  You can't help but see Spielbergs E.T. element in this act as it tries to range from emotional to humourous in small outbursts.  Some bits did make me chuckle but probably because the rest of it was so dreary.  You keep looking at the length of the filming thinking 'I hope this gets better'.  Had it not been for Teddy I may have fallen asleep (you'll see who he is when you watch it). The second act is David's daring (?) and dangerous (??) trek to escape the clutches of those who want to break him into little pieces and with the help of Jude Law, search for the answer to turn him into a real boy.  A weird mix of a Pinochio story line, a poor copy of a Blade Runner back-drop and just about every other sci-fi film you've ever seen.  The special effects are superb in this bit and Mr Law gets a chance to shine but once more the storyline lets it down.  David becomes so annoying with his obsessive search for the blue fairy you begin to think that the flesh fair had a point. And then without warning or even managing to round off the second act properly we are thrust (courtesy of a notice '2000 years later') into act three.  Simply a poor attempt to remake the mastery of the final scenes of 2001 A Space Odessy - and Odd it is.  I don't know the full history but if this is the bit that Spielberg finished for Kubrick then it shows.  If this was done by Kubrick then I expect better.  It leaves you with the same 'whats going on' feeling as 2001 only not in such a good way.  I find this bit hard to describe and can only summarise with '?'. To recap the film:- Storyline - Good idea but poorly delivered 4/10 Script - Average but annoying in places 5/10 Acting - HJO and Jude did the best they could 8/10 Music - Effective and unobtrusive 8/10 Effects - Impressive but seen better 8/10 Teddy - 10/10 Length - Tooooo long 3/10 Overall - 6/10.

The story is fairly original about a robotic boy who has ""real"" feelings of love and wants to be loved by his adopted mother.However, after a fairly good start it gets from acceptable to tedious over to absolutely pathetic. You can for fun use the time until this 2'30'' movie is finally over to count the times the boy shouts ""MOM!"" over and over. The question remains how an acclaimed film maker as Spielberg can use his time like this.I don't know what Kubrick/Spielberg wanted to show us with this movie, and I suspect neither did/do they. The fact that some of the audience was leaving the theater when I saw it and that everyone came out laughing about how incredibly bad it was should tell anyone not to see this crappy film.",A.I.

While the mecha-kid could have died a decent death for about 4 times or so, the producers choosed to push this movie to the max, making it a 2,5 hour drama with no memorisable story whatsoever.In my humble opinon this one doesn't deserve the credit it's been given for, but that's me.If you like all-american-whiny movies, than this one's probably for you.",A.I.

926,sheena-1,"Heart Wrenching, Soul Searching of our Moral depths.",9,1 May 2002,"Amazing how people see Kubrick as black and Spielberg as white, Kubrick as dark and Spielberg as light, two ends of the spectrum of movie making.  I disagree, I believe that both these men are highly intelligent and are telling the same story using the different ends to achieve the same result - to get people to listen.People who make movies have stories to share with the rest of us who queue up to hear them because of our quest for greater truths.  This is a story that needs to be told again and again until people have learnt to apply the lessons.I am not an authority on Stanley Kubrick and it is not my intention to come across as one but for me his movies have always made a statement - and I feel not one that I had to agree with or disagree with, rather one that I am to apply to my life and then examine the emotional responses that are raised.  Personally I didn't agree with Dr  Bowman's manipulation of Hal in `2001' or Dr. Harford in his exploration into the forbidden bounds of marriage in `Eyes Wide Shut' but they all raised questions which made me assess my own depths.  'AI' again raises Kubrick's original statement; `We are not alone in the Universe and we belong to Someone Greater than ourselves...."" Is it at all surprising that he has to state this again in 2001 when we just didn't get it in 1968?  Life is our responsibility. Ours.I believe that Kubrick realised the sensitivity that was needed to tell this story and quite rightly choose Steven Spielberg for his unique touch of enduring love storytelling.Life is an equation that ends with `Love never fails' and starts with 'To Love' is to 'Be Loved'.  The fortunate among us are loved first from birth however most, as in David's case, love first and forever search to be loved. David, the machine was programmed to love unconditionally but we as human have the capacity to learn to hate.  Man or Machine, we who are here first have a responsibility to those who follow.There are millions of children in this world that live each day searching for a glimmer of love, of acceptance, someone who believes in them.  Some are happy just to settle for a smile, kind word or gentle touch. And the scary part, is that they will accept this from anyone.Of all the crimes and inhumanity that humans are capable of doing to one another, the greatest crime, I believe, is to ignore their very existence. Non-acceptance in young children 'grow' disturbed teens that result in atrocious consequences, many which cannot be undone.  America has only to look at their schools and the foreign response on Sept 11.  Ireland, Palestine, Israel, too many countries in the Middle East and Africa, these have only to look at the dead eyes of living children carrying weapons to realise that this world is in dire need of love, acceptance, and self-belief.I personally thank Mr Aldiss, Mr Watson, Mr Kubrick, Mr Spielberg and all the cast and crew of 'AI ' who through this 'telling of the story' and the magic of their special talents have re-awakened the admission that in order to 'grow' a better society, a better world we first need to love and accept our children, taking the responsibility of having them more seriously and accepting the role of sacrifice for a greater cause, the child's own self worth. yes, Love never fails!

928,The Mad Reviewer,"A fascinating, entertaining, and haunting movie.",8,25 January 2002,"A.I. Artificial Intelligence (2001) Rating: 8/10This is a GREAT movie. I found it extremely moving and emotional. In fact, I was so overcome with emotion by the end of the movie, I was literally choking back sobs. Why did this movie affect me? I honestly don't know. It might have to do with the fact that I'm fascinated by anything that has to do with the future. I worry about it sometimes, like what will happen. What if the polar ice caps melt? What will we do? When and how far will artificiality go? And how real will they be considered? or what are the moral implications of A.I.? Compared to most viewers and my worries about the future (I'm not paranoid about it though), I think I had an unusually strong emotional reaction. Maybe it was Haley Joel Osment's amazing performance. One thing I noticed is that like a true robot, he never blinked. He was actually kind of creepy at first, but by the end I actually felt extremely sorry for David, even though he was, essentially, a machine. That kid deserves another Oscar nomination.Jude Law's performance was also very good, his character Gigolo Joe was entertaining and lightened up the somber mood cast by David's obsession with finding the Blue Fairy and reuniting with his mother (played wonderfully by Frances O'Connor). I would have liked to see more of his character interacting with his ""clients"". The concept of an artificial lover was intriguing. With his perfectly made up features, he looked artificial but strikingly beautiful. He was all style, all prancing, preening attitude.On a technical aspect, A.I. is phenomenal. Spielberg's directing is topnotch, turning the movie from a sterile quietness in the beginning to a warm solitude at the end. The visual effects are astounding, but subtle. They are not the reason for seeing it, nor do they think they are. They are used to help tell the story, not be the story like in most summer popcorn flicks. Spielberg's effects are reminiscent of past work, especially with the use of the ultra-advanced robots at the end, and the scenes of a drowned and abandoned New York City are both beautiful and haunting.It's easy to see why critics and movie-goers are half and half on the film. Some may find the pace too slow, for one. And it's certainly not a check-your-brains-at-the-door summer popcorn flick. Maybe it's too intelligent? I was stunned over and over again by its ability to raise important philosophical and social issues.It is a journey into the mind and into the soul of humanity; searching for questions and answers concerning our existence and the meaning of our presence. It is very good that the film doesn't provide any real answers to the questions it raises. If it would have tried to, A.I. would have been just another unrealistic Hollywood, sci-fi blockbuster. It was very brave of Steven Spielberg to avoid pleasing the crowd with easy answers and a normally developing story.There are lots of questions you'll be asking yourself at the end and lots of people hate when a films meaning isn't handed to them on a silver platter. But I think if you are reasonably mature, intelligent and can appreciate a movie that forces you to think, it is not to be missed.",A.I. Artificial Intelligence
929,Deviant Booger,Let's wait and see what time will tell,9,21 April 2002,"Maybe I'm sometimes too influenced by my own personal politics when it comes to evaluating the film I watch, but I found this film very entertaining and possibly more relavent than we may know.I've read some of the other comments for this film and most are very well thought out and very articulate, but I am left questioning just how critical we as an audience need to be when we decide wether a film was a waist of time, a guilty pleasure, or genuinely moving.Maybe I don't need to think about why Gigolo Joe's character is so attached to following around David to enjoy the chemistry they develop, and can entertain the idea that maybe in the future A.I. will actually mean intelligence as we enjoy it. Maybe I think David was exhibiting a psychotic desire to be human, because he was an imperfect prototype that was missing some of the equation, or perhaps he was a little boy that simply can't understand what he is, like so many little boys his age.
Whatever this movie was or wasn't, it is a fictional fairy tale, a modern retelling of Pinocchio, a fable that in this context echoes a possible future not so far away. Mechanically speaking, the human brain is only capable of so many calculations a second, modern computer power is quickly approaching and may soon surpass this benchmark. The idea that we could build a machine, maybe not a functional walking mecha, but a computer that can think for itself is not so far away. I find it a very entertaining premise for a film.Maybe Kubrick could have done more with it, made it deeper with more effective sub plots and other such etc., but Speilberg delivers a very entertaining movie that asks more questions than it answers, and I like that.

I wasn't sure whether I loved the movie or was disappointed by it, I just knew it had had a huge effect on me.  Having seen it a further three times at the cinema, I still find fault with it, but I keep returning to it, thinking about it, discussing it, and it has left me with a feeling that, five months later, I've still not shaked.  In many regards, this movie reminds me of Fight Club, not in terms of theme or emotional content, but due to it's level of craft, the daring nature of it's execution and the fact that I keep re-evaluating it.  All the things that are possible to comment objectively on (if anything ever is) are handled expertly.  The performances are top-notch, especially Haley Joel Osment as David, the little robot child that longs to be human.  The effects are not only very impressive, but are integrated into the story rather than calling attention to themselves.  Januz Kaminski's photography is, as one has come to expect, impressive, and the movie is unusually unpredictable for such a big-budget experience. In my opinion, John Williams' score is among his most impressive.  I listened to it on CD for three weeks before seeing the movie, and thought it was fantastic, but once the movie started rolling I completely forgot about the music.  That says a lot about both the score and the film itself.  I also liked the three-act structure, in which the tone and feel of the movie changes drastically as the story progresses.  Part one, as one reviewer noted, feels like a cross between E.T. and The Shining, an odd, but very effective combination.  The second part of the movie is awash with Spielbergian imagery, but with the darkness and coldness of a Kubrick movie. And the last part is a head-scratcher that has the intellectual resonance of most Kubrick-films, and the emotional tone of something like Cinema Paradiso.  I purposely refrain from saying that it is as emotional as Spielberg-films, because I think the director's complexities, the dark aspects of his style, and the occasional subtleties of his work are often overlooked by critics. It's difficult to discuss the themes of the movie without spoiling it, but while many people criticised the movie from having several false endings, I felt that each continuation added layers of though and complexities that the movie would have lacked had it ended sooner.

932,stigwiksnes,"The new 2001 - A Space Odyssey, now with Spielberg involved :)",9,12 March 2002,"This movie was originally a Stanley Kubrick production but he sadly passed away some time before he could finish this project, which is sad.Kubrick really was ahead of his time when he back in 1960 directed Spartacus, starring Kirk Douglas. This was a movie of epic scale with movie sets bigger than ever seen before. Eight years later, Kubrick directed and produced the timeless classic ""2001 - A Space Odyssey,"" a production he cared so much for that even details as what kind of screws the set crew used for assembling the spaceship had to be verified by Stanley himself. This kind of attention to detail resulted in one of the biggest movies ever. Kubrick was a man eager to explore the human mind and how it reacted when exposed to bizarre and sometimes unimaginable situations. In 2001 ASO, we had HAL, a supercomputer threatening to take over command on the spaceship, where the humans had to struggle for their lives against a.i. ""2001 - A Space Odyssey"" came out when the space age was in its infancy and made some people fear the technological progression while others laughed of Kubrick's fictional sense of drama.This brings me to AI, a movie that really is true to Kubricks insights in modern society and where it will take us in a ""what if..."" scenario. AI is in many ways comparable to 2001 A Space Odyssey in which the viewer is required to really stay focused on what is really going on. If you watch the movie with a laid back attitude while concerned about if you brought enough popcorn to last the whole movie, you should have picked another movie for your viewing pleasure.There is a lot of layers in AI, and to get the most out of it you should see it once and digest it for weeks, months even, and then pick it up on video/DVD and watch it all over. I guarantee that the story will grow on you and you will always remember it, much in the same sense the viewers of 2001 A Space Odyssey back in 1968.Even in the year 2001, people still fear what Kubrick may have foreseen while the rest yawn through the 2 hour + movie and then laugh of his fictional sense of drama.",A.I.

933,Panon,A strangely heterogeneous movie about serious moral issues that will be disputed in centuries to come,8,3 April 2002,"For anyone who felt an inexplicable, bizarre sympathy for HAL in 2001 and contemplated about many moral issues in the wake of the recent meteoric developments in science and technology, AI had been awaited with great anticipation.AI is concerned with hot philosophical and moral questions that we are unavoidably facing in the (near) future: Is man prepared to accept the role of a God and embrace his own creation? Judging from the movie, apparently not. And how can we expect anything else? Humans are finding hard to accept humans of different social, racial or ethnical origin. There is no way on Earth that we are ready for intelligent machines. It is a scary thought since a self-learning, self-thinking and self-acting machine is at hand (50, 100 or 200 years, does it really matter?). We are creating machines because we want to make our lives easier and more enjoyable. There will be a point in the future where we will have to ask machine-slaves if they want to do something else with their lives.Someone may argue that a machine is created and ""programmed"" by man, so it cannot do anything we don't want it to do. David is certainly conceived so, but he is the first generation of robots who is deliberately ""programmed"" to stray from his algorithm to mimic a human more closely (or is he the first generation? - a question imposed at the flesh fair). But how can we tell him from a regular boy? Are his feelings, emotions, and spontaneousness genuine? It certainly looks that way. Aren't we all in some way ""programmed"" by our DNA? Very soon we will be able to literally program the DNA of a human to give it a certain disposition, endow it with a talent, or even to prolong his/her life. Then why a difference with the machines? Is the reason so superficial that we more readily accept something physically resembling us? (A flesh fair crowd, stunned at the David's resemblance to a normal boy, disbelieves that he is a robot at all)Even though I can't provide answers to all these questions, I know that I am willing to accept anyone or anything that responds to human emotions as a living, sensible creature (sometimes even bad actors). As to whether the things I see are real or not, sometimes I cannot say.It is because of these serious issues the film deals with that I find it intriguing and very relevant. The plot of the movie, however, is strangely chopped into Kubrick and Spielberg sequences that somehow do not appear to go together well. It looks like an interesting exercise, though, and the incompatibility of the legendary directors certainly contributes to its uniqueness.  With the excellent acting and the compelling topic it is good enough to feed my thoughts until the next attempt.9/10",A.I. Artificial Intelligence

Did David's parents think about the consequences of having the robot David possibly having to interact with their real life son?  There's no evidence that they did. The film has some interesting special effects, but in the last half of the movie the plots really bogs down, and David's 'quest' becomes an interminably drawn out affair. Long before the film's end, I found I had lost interest and wanted it to be over and done with. The only positive is Haley Joel Osment's superb acting.  The kid is good!  His facial expressions were perfect, and there was none of the syrupy, cutesy mawkishness that so many child actors fall into.  Too bad he had such a terrible screenplay to work with.

That way it would be kind of exciting which film he'd bring back. He brought back Artificial Intelligence.Another friend of mine recommended it to me, and I'd read that Kubrick (one of my favorite-directors) was involved in the production in some way. So I started watching without any second thoughts.That changed quite fast. When I start watching a film I wanna see it to the end, except for when it is so bad it isn't even ""funny-bad"". This wasn't funny at all, but it was bad, and still I continued watching. Haley Joel Osment, I can't stand him. It works in Forrest Gump when he's got a very small part. And the Sixth Sense that was the first big role I saw him in you hadn't got time to get mad about him. Good actors are important to make a good film, and I know you can't complain as much if the actor's a kid, but I can't resist complaining on Osment. But the other adult actors are just as bad. The plot, the setting too, I wanted to turn it off. But I didn't. I wonder how it had been if Kubrick was alive when the film was finished, if it would've been the way it is I'm not sure it would've got shown in theatres - maybe straight to video.

942,KenClark,Spielberg's masterpiece,10,22 February 2003,"The film is an incredibly sad story, yet Spielberg's other masterpiece, Schindler's list was equally exquisitely sad. Human emotion expressed so devastatingly well by the robot boy David is just as real as any expressed by a human. Any little child sent away from home (think of young Scrooge so sad on Christmas day and far from home) and longing to see mama and or papa will identify with David and truly feel his pain. The movie works on several layers successfully, it is science fiction in the truest sense, it is spectacle, think of the cities of neon and the demolition derby. It is perhaps satisfying to those longing for their daily dose of violence. There is plenty of that here. Halley Joel Osment's performance is the lynchpin, if you identify with him, then the internal agony reflected in his incredible eyes will haunt you for some time after. Frances O'Connor's performance as David's mother is a tour de force. We cannot forget Joe Gigolo, by Jude Law. All I can say is My goodness. This is a film to last a century.",A.I.

944,ender342,flawed masterpiece,9,3 August 2006,"I have seen this film about a dozen times and will probably see it a dozen times more. I consider it a flawed masterpiece but I understand why many people detest it. It is surely the most sentimental film that has ever been made about a robot. (Though it is the product of a posthumous collaboration between Spielberg and Kubrick it often seems to embody the spirit of that unashamed sentimentalist Ray Bradbury.) There is so much to appreciate -- beginning with one of the most amazing performances by a young actor in the history of film -- that the plot and dialogue faults seem like screeches of chalk on blackboard.There are mysteries here too (mysterious at least to me) which I would dearly like to see resolved.Be warned: everything hereafter is a spoiler.Faults: we see David undergo an open-thorax operation with perfect equanimity: ""It doesn't hurt"", he assures his 'mother'. But a couple of scenes later when a youngster pricks him slightly with a knife (assuring him he means no harm) David freaks out and clutches his 'brother' in terror. Why? Apparently only to move the plot in the desired direction. Surely this could have been engineered in more credible fashion.The bit of doggerel that leads David back to the doctor doesn't make sense: ""Come away, oh human child..."" The whole point is that he is _not_ a human child, at least not yet.Why is Dr. Hobby's lab located in the sunken city rather than in the more convenient company headquarters in New Jersey? Why does Hobby leave David alone after having shattered his illusions? Again, apparently just to make the plot move in the desired direction. This seems to me to be clumsy, even lazy scripting.The police follow the stolen amphibicopter, pluck Gigolo Joe into the sky -- and just ignore the multi-million-dollar piece of hardware that then carries David on his short trip to Coney Island where he sits for 2000 years. Don't these vehicles have location devices? What ever happened to sonar? Both the government and the corporation would possess ample resources and motivation to search and recover the errant machines. The film provides no explanation as to why they didn't.Just before the final scene David and we are subjected to a long-winded and implausible explication of the quirks of the space-time continuum that will limit the duration of his reunion. This slows down the action at the worst possible time. The Blue Fairy could simply have told him that the event could only last a day, period. It wasn't necessary to give him or us a course in fantasy physics.In addition to these glaring faults (and perhaps others I have missed) there are some puzzles that I would very much like to see cleared up. If Mr. Spielberg happens to read this I would appreciate his doing so. If not, I would be interested in others' considered opinions on the following: when David is staggering in growing despair between the panels of Davids and Darlenes, one of the panels suddenly moves. Is another David coming to life behind it? If so why do we not see him? If not then what is happening? When David later awakes in the familiar surroundings of his home the scene is quite deliberately made unreal. The colors are garish, the scene is blurry. The whole effect is exactly that of an old piece of film that has lain for many years until the colors have begun to go bad. But as soon as he moves into the room with the Blue Fairy, the film comes into focus and the colors become more natural. What is Spielberg trying to tell us? Is the whole event happening in David's head? If so why are the 'aliens' (or millennial robots) depicted observing the event from a balcony? The final scene of course recalls the ending of '2001' but is if anything more obscure than its famous predecessor. (At least part of it seems to be a mental rather than a real event: that big moon scurries offstage in most unrealistic fashion.) Does David really sleep? Really dream? Does he too die or is his sleep the beginning of something truly new? (Is his name a mere coincidence? He could have been Tommy or Dickie or even little Harry.) Could it be that he is forging in the smithy of his digital soul the uncreated conscience of a new robotic race? In short, what is going on here? If anyone here knows the answers, please set them out for those such as I who are too literal-minded to grasp it on our own. And could you email me a copy to ensure I don't miss it?",A.I.

None of it makes any sense, be it the ""space-time continuum"" gobblety-gook as pretense for resurrecting mom (with memories!) from a bit of hair, or the absurd conflict at home that begins the story.The screen play is profoundly fractured. It opens with moody, precise scenes that remind one of Kubrick. It abruptly changes to an over-the-top trashy splatter flick, full of absurd action scenes, and completely cheese-ball. By the end it's fallen apart so badly they resort to a pretentious voice-over to tell you what's happening. It feels like three or four screen plays by different authors were pasted together.Ham-fisted gimmicks for sentimental effect are everywhere. The central question of movie (machines with emotion) is barely explored at all, and what little is there makes no sense. ""David"" is supposed to be this dramatic technological advance, yet every machine in the movie (including the teddy bear) expresses emotion.This movie has no redeeming features.

946,THE_Tetsuo,deep and thought-provoking,8,22 September 2003,"This movie was not very well-received when it initially came out, but I believe that it was due to the timing of its release.  It came out about two months before 9/11.  Most people couldn't or wouldn't think of the deeper meanings in this movie at the time, be it the idea of artificial beings having real thoughts emotions or even souls; or the idea of humanity being able to accept these artificial beings as their own.  These themes were explored in the Robin Williams movie ""The Bicentennial Man"" that came out two years earlier, but I think that A.I. was far better in terms of story structure and the overall tone of the movie.Considering the number of recent posts lauding this movie, I think the tragedy of 9/11 and peoples' mortality has begun to weigh so much more heavily on our society that a movie that poses such deep questions is more easily understood by people today.This film was loosely based on Brian Aldiss' short story ""Supertoys Last All Summer Long"" but digresses greatly from the initial point of that story. While the sci-fi story wasn't bad, I think that Kubrick and Spielberg did a phenomenal job in progressing with those themes than did Aldiss; though Aldiss did have some small contributions to the film when shortly collaborating with the late, great Stanley Kubrick before their egos took over.Spielberg really proved he could do sci-fi w/o resorting to cheesy special effects (with the notable exception of those ridiculous Hounds costumes in the movie) or trying to tidy up little plot point for the sake of pleasing the audience.

The plot meandered backwards and forwards from one unbelievable situation to another even more unlikely situation. During the final minutes I could actually have believed that a different film was being shown, which was even more ludicrous than the previous one. Why oh why were stereotypical looking aliens with televisions in their heads waxing lyrical about the wonders of humanity when the evidence of our own fall, at our own hands no less was frozen in the ice all about them.

949,derekmccallan,Magnificent Film,10,20 July 2008,"On my top ten list, ""A.I. Artificial Intelligence"" is one of the most well written, acted, and technically brilliant films of this decade. Being one of the most anticipated films of 2001, I was surprised by the negative responses of critics and by how poorly it did at the box office. Categorized as a Sci-Fi fairy tale, ""A.I."" is far from the cutesy ""little boy robot"" movie that one would expect from director Steven Spielberg. Instead, we are shown a thought provoking and dark view of the future and a robot child's quest for the love of his mother.Global warming has melted the polar ice caps. Major cities, including New York, are underwater. In a world of starvation and population control, humans have become dependent on ""mechas""; robots simulating human appearance and behavior. Cybertonics Inc. creates a robot child named David (Haley Joel Osment), and advanced prototype capable of love once a permanent imprinting program is activated. David is given to employee (Sam Robarbs) and his wife Monica (Frances O'Connor) to try out. Their son Martin, in a cryogenic state, comes home with a little resentment and jealousy towards his ""mecha"" replacement after an unexpected cure is found for his illness. David's human family isn't prepared for these consequences and there is a heart-wrenching scene where David is abandoned in the woods by his mother. Suddenly, David and his animatronic toy bear Teddy, are thrown into a strange and dangerous world. With undertones of the Disney classic, Monica had read ""Pinnochio"" to David so he believes that if he finds the blue fairy, he will be turned into a real boy and his mother will love him again.Based on the short story ""SuperToys Last all Summer Long"", the late Stanley Kubrick held back from filming in the 80's due to special effect costs. Supposedly, Kubrick wanted to use a real robot instead of an actor to play David. Directing from notes left by Kubrick, the collaboration between the two have resulted in one of Spielberg's finest pieces of work. The film as a whole is no less than magnificent and truly never got the attention or praise that it deserved.Also starring Jude Law who picked up an Oscar nomination for his role as ""mecha"" male prostitute Gigolo Joe.",A.I.

There was nothing to connect to. Thought Haley Joel Osment did an amazing job as an actor in this film, it was not enough to carry the film. And, his character was just plain creepy. The family that bought him was messed up, and I wish that that dynamic was played out a bit more. This movie is the obsessive compulsive person's dream film. Loving someone so much, with no other emotions to balance it out, that your entire existence is driven by that fact. For ever.The ending contained the most interesting part in how the creators of this film envisioned the earth several thousand years from now. But, even though the vision was interesting, the future folks were just as creepy as the kid. They just wanted to placate him, making him happy by supporting this unnatural dependence on his love for the mom that bought him, and did not love him back. These future earthlings, too, had some weird obsession with humans. I guess how I feel goes to the question a character brought up at the very beginning of the film. ""You can make a robot have the emotion of love. But, can a human love the robot back?"" I would have to say that, if robots loved the way this kid did, then no. I could not love a robot. I don't believe that was the response the creators were intending, so I think they failed in their endeavor.The saving grace of the film was Teddy. The best character by far.",A.I.

953,branstark,A captivating and immersive piece of filmmaking,10,8 July 2020,"The movie is set in the future where artificial intelligence is evolving at such a rate that the human population are beginning to get concerned about the ethical implications of substituting humans for robots and what role humans will play (if any) in the future. Integrating robots into society started as a means for humans to avoid doing mundane jobs - a convenience. But as more sophisticated robots were invented to fill even more jobs - like nannies and butlers - with an advanced and intricate likeness to humans, this led to further controversy and people started paying to see robots rounded up and killed in gladiatorial fashion.The story follows one such robot, David who's designed to look like a boy. He was created as an experiment - to see if a robot could feel and display absolute, unconditional love for his mother. Although the standard robots exhibited a rudimentary understanding of social awareness and could be programmed to communicate with humans at a basic level, they could not display any level of emotion: to love, to hate and to form genuine friendships with humans. The idea was for the robot to act as a surrogate child, to cater for parents who can't conceive or who have suffered the loss of their own child. He was programmed with the mind of a boy to love his mother above all else. Love can be a complicated and dangerous program if that is all the robot is designed to do. Creating a robot to exhibit emotions like love will naturally mean they could develop the ability to experience jealousy, hate and since they're not programmed to understand consequence, logic or reasoning of any kind it leads to confusion. David struggles to settle and the rivalry with his human sibling escalates. He can't understand why Monica (the person he's programmed to love) won't love him back. After a series of incidents which arose as a result of David being scared or confused, the family fear for their safety even though his intentions weren't malicious or sinister in nature. Tensions escalate and David is expelled by the family and dumped in the woods.And so begins his journey to find the Blue Fairy - the mythical character who turns Pinocchio into a real boy - in an attempt to win his mother's love by becoming human. What's most heartbreaking is that we, the viewer, know there's no such thing as the Blue Fairy and a robot cannot become a real boy. His travails are doomed from the get-go and yet he journeys on, avoiding humans and their prejudice on a quest that spans 2000 years with such a fierce yearning you could only expect from a naive child. It's a gut wrenching story as he tries to make sense and come to terms with his existence. And with such little programming and his inability to understand basic human logic, he never fully gets to understand why he was created. Why won't his mother love him back and why does everyone despise him? Haley Joel Osment is fantastic here playing such a complicated and conflicted role which reinforces the belief that he was one of the greatest child actors of all time.The movie was originally the creation of the late Stanley Kubrick, but he was unable to complete his vision. Steven Spielberg picked up the project and although the movie received very mixed reviews, Spielberg did well to deliver a movie with visual effects way ahead of its time, drafted in John Williams to compose one of his best scores and put together a cast full of talent including Robin Williams, Meryl Streep, Jude Law, Brendan Gleeson and Chris Rock.A captivating and immersive piece of filmmaking which explores the unfortunate effects of human stigma and the lengths some children will go to uncover the truth about their purpose in the world.

Unfortunately, this film falls into the second group for me.The movie has three segments, and they go from pretty good to mixed to supremely, achingly awful.  If only he had the vision to end his project at what is now the 2/3 mark, it would have been a pretty good film.  I would have left the theater mulling some essential questions about what makes us human and how we treat the things we ""love"".  Instead, the film takes a sharp left turn into the absurd, into territory he has unfortunately traveled before.  Combined with the appearance of an Amblin / Dreamworks SKG-like moon in the second segment, the reappearance of some familiar characters in the final third of the movie may have been inspiring to some, but my overall reaction was, ""Oh, come on!"".It's as though Elliot and E.T. had shown up for the climactic battle scenes of ""Saving Private Ryan"", wandering through a bombed-out French village.Spielberg misses an excellent opportunity to ruminate on the nature of what makes us human, and our moral responsibility to things we create.  He touches on this subject lightly once or twice, then backs away.  Instead, we get a corrupt and Hollywood-esque ending.I've seen interviews where Spielberg intimates that he wanted to make a movie for his kids.  This is NOT a children's movie by any stretch of the imagination.In fact, it's not an adult movie.  It's a movie suitable only for robots, I suppose.  Perhaps they would exhibit the correct pre-programmed responses to this film.  The real, human audience surrounding me mostly shook their heads in disbelief.",A.I. Artificial Intelligence

As it is basically a retelling of the fairy tale ""Pinocchio"" in a sci-fi setting, the fairytale elements often coexist with the hard sci-fi elements. If you go in expecting a techno-thriller (as hinted at by the online game), you will be disappointed. However, if you can get in to the fairytale aspects, and ignore some of the scientific inconsistencies, you will enjoy yourself.

There were too many different concepts.  Sci-Fi buffs (as myself) were attracted to it's ads but the Science was poor, if not annoying, and logic of events was awlful.  The ""parents"" acted as if they knew nothing of robots. What's supposed to happen when the boy ""grows up"" or can he. Is the Mother supposed to have a child-Mother relationship for her next 50 yrs? Special effects were good, however, as we all expect these days.Spielberg is trying to use his artistry in a sci-fi setting.  Too illogical to work.  His view of the future is bleak and black at every turn - immoral robots, the Fleshpits, Rouge City, Flooding of the earth. How could ""Love"" from a robot boy fit in at all in this society. The Movie seemed to be a combination of other movie techniques all different. That is, passive scenes in the beginning to the FleshPits like ""Mad Max at Thunderdrome"", to the journey to see Dr. Know - ala the ""Wizard of Oz"", and narration style at the end by Ben Kingsly, as well as the ""2nd"" ending - which seemed like a stretch just to have happy ending.Recent similar movies that I thought were much better and evenly made are : ""Bicentennial Man"" with Robin Williams and "" Gattica"".It was captivating but my rating is about 6 of 10.",A.I.

960,craigbe,2001: A Spielberg Odyssey,8,27 June 2001,"It's now been about 12 hours since I left the screening of A.I. last night, and I'm still not exactly sure what to say about it.  I think I feel like I felt the last time I saw 2001: A Space Odyssey.  Okay, I'm not sure about this whole monkey thing at the beginning, but that's okay, suddenly we're in space, and we're trying to figure out how to not get killed by HAL, the computer that's gone haywire, great - I'm with ya.  Then, the obelisk shows up, with the baby, and the old man in the bed, and I'm just sitting there with my mouth open saying, `huh?'That's the closest approximation I can make to how I feel about A.I. Spielberg takes us into the near future and modernizes the Pinocchio tale by creating a robot boy in the image of the amazing Haley Joel Osment, and giving him to a family that has lost a son.  This is the first robot, however, to truly feel and experience love of a human.  After an accident occurs, however, he ends up on a journey, with his supertoy Teddy, to find the Blue Fairy, believing he can become a real boy.What this story is really about though is unrequited love.  However, it's unrequited love raised to the nth degree.  Can you portray any love stronger than the love between a parent and a child?  What if the love from that child never, never fades?  And I do mean never.That's when the big `huh?' factor came in for me.  The movie moves along, it all makes sense, and it comes to a point that seems like a natural conclusion - fade to black and everything.  That's when I thought, `wow, that was a pretty special movie.  It took tons of risks, was scary, funny, exciting, broke new ground, just incredible.'  The problem was that the movie didn't end there.  No, it went on for another 30 minutes or so, and while much of it was spectacular to watch, it didn't fit with the rest of the film, didn't make much sense, was predictable, and even corny.I guess I'll put it this way: even when Michael Jordan or Tiger Woods is having an off day, they're still incredible to watch.  They're not just doing a job; they're artists, and even if they bogey every hole on the front nine, or if they only shoot 5 for 21, they're going to do something amazing, something you've never seen before.  That's why we continue to watch these people, that's why expectations are ridiculously high for them, and that's why you should see the latest film from Steven Spielberg.",A.I.

961,tnk,A fairy tale for the digital age.,10,29 October 2001,"After a long time he didn't direct a movie, Spielberg comes back on da scene. I wondered what the result would be...and it seems that, at least for Spielberg, directing is like biking : once you know it, you can always do it. A.I. is the living proof of this.This movie is, as you might have guessed, an EXCELLENT one ! A movie that should embodies by itself the metaphoric power of major science-fiction works, and it makes no doubt to me this one will be a classic of the sci-fi genre.The movie starts quite slowly - a bit too slowly maybe, that's the only negative point to it - but, even if it never really speeds up (on this point, it can be compared to 2001 : a space odyssey) , it gets more and more intense, and the final half an hour is to me one of the best and most original endings in sci-fi history, and without any doubts one of the deepest in terms of meanings and emotional charge. Don't expect a thrilling action movies full of gunshots and explosion, this movie is very far from it, very calm, almost ""Zen"". This is far behind a simple sci-fi story. It's a philosophical fairy tale for grown ups, something that puts hopes in our hearts during those troubled times.The influence of Stanley Kubrick is clearly to be felt and the reference to 2001 obvious. Same theme (a computerized being's quest to become alive), same strange places especially at the end (the place - I'm referring to it in this very general term to avoid spoiling - where the end of the film takes place makes me think quite much of those white rooms in the end of 2001), Same rhythm.The cinematography is really awesome and gives much sense to the movie. The same goes to the very ethereous, ambient-alike music John Williams composed.Haley Joel Osment, who plays robot-child David, is to my opinion even better in this movie than in his previous masterpiece ""The 6th sense"" (This time, please give him the oscar!). Congrats, little big boy !A+ also for the special effects. It should get at least an oscar nomination, And I even bet on it for winning the price this year ! It's also very interesting to have such high-level FXs in such a movie...this can show the people who don't like FXs that they can be used in many various ways, and not only to depcit big explosions after that Schwartzenegger, Stallone or Willis has said something like ""Eat this!"".What else can be said about this true masterpiece ? Maybe that it is, with E.T. an Schindler's list, Spielberg's best work...I guess this says it all !!!/TNKNow some SPOILER (don't read it if you want to experience a total surprise) :* * *S P O I L E RS P A C E* * *I will only reveal the content of one shot - that is not decisive for the story itself but that had a big impact on the audience in the theater I was watching the movie in : When our heroes reach Manhattan, we discover a skyline where almost every buildings are destroyed...except for the twin towers !

Mostly outstanding from Haley Joel Osment (who wouldn't expect that though) and Frances O'Connor.I had only seen her in Bedazzled before this and she really shocked me with her talent. Also,the effectswere outstanding. My favorite set was the New York City submerged under water. Every other person I've talked to about this movie considered the ""Fleshfair"" to be sick.

964,Bijuno,Purest emotions,8,23 September 2001,"Let me put it this way.
People don´t seem to understand that not everything in a movie needs to be explained.  It just happens and that´s it.  It depends of the story. 
In this movie we experience a lot of plot turns and twists that doesn´t need to be explained, because it is a fairy tale.Do you imagine what would have been if we read Peter Pan and it explained that he never grew up because he had some kind of a gland syndrome that didn´t allow him to grow, etc. etc.?No, because it will ruin the whole point of the fairy tale.  Who would want to know all that technical and irrelevant stuff?That´s what A.I.´s about.  It is a robot´s fairy tale.  And what better to a NON-human being that feels emotions that to compare him with Pinochio? It is the best point of view.It´s all about imagination.  Child imagination.  Filled with colors, figures, buildings, seas and skies, people and animals, to do things that you cannot normally do like to fly high and to breath beneath the water.
It´s all about the basic emotions that we learn when we are children, loving and hating, missing and meeting...And it is all about searching for hidden treasures, great wizards, sky cities, and the best ones of all, searching for wishes.
I din´t care about the length.  For me it was just perfect, it gives you just what you need to know. Nothing more, nothing less.When you think that it is going to finish you just want it to keep going and the beautiful thing is that it keeps going!I was thrilled with it´s visual accomplishments, and the astounding performances.  And I was just pleased by the plot.  Simple, going like a leaf in the wind.  Pure poetry.And I didn´t care about Kubrick.  I love his films, but I simply accepted the fact that he´s gone, and I think Spielberg didn´t filled anybody´s shoes, he just did what he liked to, and that is visual emotions,
the purest and most simple ones.",A.I. Artificial Intelligence
965,Belander,You have to see it before you know.,10,20 December 2001,"The predominant thought in my mind while watching this movie was simply this: Not a lot of people are going to like this. It's not only the kind of movie that you either love or hate, but it's the kind of movie that you have to be of a certain mindset to understand. The most popular movies are the most vapid one because shallowness appeals to a general audience. The deeper you go, the more specific you get, the less people are going to understand (read: like) your movie.      That said... I loved this movie.Almost every review I've read or heard about this film has reflected the above thought. Many (on both sides) speak from ignorance about the subject and many others truly understand the limitations of such a specific film. Some people cited its ""failure"" as being due to Steven Spielberg taking over the project from Kubrick, but the truth is that the two of them had been working on it together for a long time before Stanley Kubrick's untimely death. You can't approach it thinking like a Kubrick fan, because it's Spielberg. You can't expect a Spielberg film because it's Kubrick. It takes the depth of a Kubrick film and the communicability of a Spielberg movie and creates a story that is a mixture of both, but not entirely either.
There is an atmosphere to Artificial Intelligence that is transcendent. If you are lucky enough to catch it, then you'll be blown away. I left the theatre feeling like the earth had shifted beneath me, and I've talked to many who've felt the same way. It is a very personal and touching story about childhood, and relationships and motherhood and life and death and far more than I can fit here. But trust me, unlike many movies today, it holds the ability to take your breath away and knock you off your feet... if you'll let it.At the very least, it has some of the most amazing CG effect I've ever seen. At most, it was the best movie I'd seen in at least 5 years. But the point is that you can't tell if you'll like it or not until you've seen it, so don't let anyone color your experience. You might love it, you might hate it, but that's the only way to know for sure. For your own sake, watch this movie. It's a gamble, but it's got an amazing payoff.",A.I. Artificial Intelligence

Awfully Imperfect,5,3 July 2001,"While visually stunning in many instances and containing a stellar score from John Williams (as always), as well as wonderful performances by Haley Joel Osment and particularly Jude Law, AI was very very disappointing.  The abrupt shifts between Act 1 and Act 2 and then the almost interminable and unnecessary Act 3 were startling and very off-putting.  The more time that passes since seeing the film, the less I find I liked it.  While the beginning wasn't great, the ending ruined any goodwill I might have had for AI.  If you're going to see this movie, go to a matinee.  $8 is just too much to spend on a sugar-coated gumdrop that takes forever to get to the juicy center, especially when all you wind up with in the end is an awful, cheap, saccharine aftertaste that won't leave you for days.

I agree with a number of the reviews I've read here, but I also can't emphasize enough that Kubrick's/Spielberg's movie does a lot more than just tell a Pinnochio story.In my opinion, the movie makers took a challenging subject and did they best they could.

David, although purportedly more human than any other robot still acts tragically like a robot throughout the film. His inability to accept any other idea or 'programming' even when it was patently obvious his quest was futile just served to remind us of how inflexible and mechanical his decision making processes were. If a person falls out of a relationship they generally accept it and look for something else. David was unable to do this, and it just showed us how inhuman he really was. What makes humans human is their ability to CHANGE their priorities; change their 'programming' in a sense, Something David was unable to do. And where the film fell down was the bizarre contrast of this with the actions of Gigolo Jo, who abandons his original programming to follow David off on his pointless jaunt in search of his 'mother', a much more 'human' decision than ever David managed.",A.I.

Synopsis:-The mother's struggle with her choice - predictable/unconvincing. 
-The father's enthusiasm with his company's trust/imposition - predictable/unconvincing.-The corporate monster's predictable patriarchal mess with stay at home wifey's emotional head. - Antiquated/annoying.-The idea that a couple would choose a robot over their not even dead and buried son. - Ludicrous/predictable/annoying.-The flesh fair.  - That will no doubt happen, but I've seen it already on Springer.  - Boring.-The idea that humans can never love robots. - Absurd.  People fall in love with inanimate objects all the time.  There's no moral or ethical argument here.  Add a personality and cripes, what have you then?-The idea the two parents would be blinded to the provocation of David by their son. - Probably.  Happens all the time, but damn, did you have to put it in another movie. - Predictable/Boring.-Mother drops boy in woods. I'm sorry I didn't tell you about the world. -Boo Hoo/Melodramatic/poorly acted on the part of the mother.-Five boys in a car looking for whores. - Did we really need to see that again?  - Boring-Young innocent boy taken to whore city. - Boring boring boring.-David is an unoriginal automaton. - Woo woo - aren't we all. - Boring.-David keeps begging for 2000 years. - He's a robot.  He's programmed to do that.  - Not very sad/entirely predictable.-Keen future looking robots.  - So?-David falls asleep. - How? Why? Did he turn into a real boy?  And how did this happen?  Magic?  - Don't get me wrong, I can handle a fairy tale and make believe with the best of them, but this movie couldn't make up it's mind. - Annoying/Laughable.Garbage.The people that enjoyed this movie are probably not well read.  Or maybe they haven't seen that many movies.  Or if they have they weren't paying attention.  Or maybe they're young, which would actually be the best excuse.

One, I believed from what I had seen in previews that one of its merits would be its presence on the big screen (I was wrong since most of it was just talking heads). Two, I was anxious, like many people, to see what Spielberg would do with something that had once passed through the mind of Stanley Kubrick. In a nutshell, if there had ever been anything of merit in Kubrick's original idea, it had been ""Spielberg-ed"" out of it a long time ago. The irony of the title in relation to the handling of its subject matter is painfully obvious. Spielberg uses all the artifices of manipulative Hollywood cinema to have us believe that he is dealing with ""intelligent"" subject matter. Ultimately, he is doing nothing more than yet again playing at being one notch above the public, continuing his self-appointed roll as ""teacher"" (begun in films such as Schindler's List and Saving Private Ryan) by treating us like we are stupider and more easily manipulated than anything Pavlov could have hoped for. When will we learn that 'complex and subtle' does not mean 'it made me cry'! So very, very unfortunately, this ends up being a thinly strung together story drowned in a swamp of overused and sappy music, plot holes so big they would make a first year film student blush and so little imagination one is duty-bound to wonder how this guy can so easily continue to make money off our backs. The only scene worth mentioning is the one in which Jude Law tries to explain to a sobbing woman why she should not be afraid to have sex with him even though he is a robot. It was the only scene that spoke of genuine(ish)human fears and the (possible) unusual problems one might face when creating an artificial human being.

976,ender34,cavils and questions ( *SPOILERS *),9,25 May 2003,"I have seen this film about a dozen times and will probably see it a dozen times more.  I consider it a flawed masterpiece but I understand why many people detest it.  It is surely the most sentimental film that has ever been made about a robot.  (Though it is the product of a posthumous collaboration between Spielberg and Kubrick it often seems to embody the spirit of that unashamed sentimentalist Ray Bradbury.) There is so much to appreciate -- beginning with one of the most amazing performances by a young actor in the history of film -- that the plot and dialogue faults seem like screeches of chalk on blackboard. There are mysteries here too (mysterious at least to me) which I would dearly like to see resolved.Be warned: everything hereafter is a spoiler.Faults:  we see David undergo an open-thorax operation with perfect equanimity: ""It doesn't hurt"", he assures his `mother'.  But a couple of scenes later when a youngster pricks him slightly with a knife (assuring him he means no harm) David freaks out and clutches his `brother' in terror. Why?  Apparently only to move the plot in the desired direction.  Surely this could have been engineered in a more credible fashion.The bit of doggerel that leads David back to the doctor is not only execrable poetry, it doesn't make sense: ""Come away, oh human child..."" The whole point is that he is _not_ a human child, at least not yet.Why is Dr. Hobby's lab located in the sunken city rather than in the more convenient company headquarters in New Jersey?  Why does Hobby leave David alone after having shattered his illusions?  Again, apparently just to make the plot move in the desired direction.  This seems to me to be clumsy, even lazy scripting.The police follow the stolen amphibicopter, pluck Gigolo Joe into the sky -- and just ignore the multi-million-dollar piece of hardware that then carries David on his short trip to Coney Island where he sits for 2000 years. Don't these vehicles have location devices?  What ever happened to sonar?  Both the government and the corporation would possess ample resources and motivation to search and recover the errant machines.  The film provides no explanation as to why they didn't.Just before the final scene David and we are subjected to a long-winded and implausible explication of the quirks of the space-time continuum that will limit the duration of his reunion.  This slows down the action at the worst possible time.  The Blue Fairy could simply have told him that the event could only last a day, period.  It wasn't necessary to give him or us a course in fantasy physics.In addition to these glaring faults (and perhaps others I have missed) there are some puzzles that I would very much like to see cleared up. If Mr. Spielberg happens to read this I would appreciate his doing so. If not, I would be interested in others' considered opinions on the following:when David is staggering in growing despair between the panels of Davids and Darlenes, one of the panels suddenly moves.  Is another David coming to life behind it?  If so why do we not see him?  If not then what is happening?When David later awakes in the familiar surroundings of his home the scene is quite deliberately made unreal.  The colors are garish, the scene is blurry.  The whole effect is exactly that of an old piece of film that has lain for many years until the colors have begun to go bad.  But as soon as he moves into the room with the Blue Fairy, the film comes into focus and the colors become more natural.  What is Spielberg trying to tell us?  Is the whole event happening in David's head?  If so why are the `aliens' (or millennial robots) depicted observing the event from a balcony?The final scene of course recalls the ending of `2001' but is if anything more obscure than its famous predecessor. (At least part of it seems to be a mental rather than a real event: that big moon scurries offstage in most unrealistic fashion.) Does David really sleep?  Really dream?  Does he too die or is his sleep the beginning of something truly new?  (Is his name a mere coincidence?  He could have been Tommy or Dickie or even little Harry.) Could it be that he is forging in the smithy of his digital soul the uncreated conscience of a new robotic race?

While watching A.I., I experienced new emotions that I had never felt before, a familiarity I hadn't encountered from a film since last years Crouching Tiger. I was completely pulled in from minute one.For me, the first act was the strongest, because the way the story was told, during this point, was the most unconventional and indescribable to me. Every scene between Osment and O'Connor are just so rich and believable. They have an incredibly internal chemistry which I haven't scene in a while. The one scene where O'Connor first programs David with the seven-digit code is just so tense and touching. The moment where David `comes to life,' and says mommy, and then camera cuts to a CU of O'Connor's reaction, just totally killed me, like so many other moments in the film. The scene which ends the first act, where Osment is abandoned in the woods by his mother, is also another scene which completely effected me. Haley during this scene is simply fantastic, but the real gem in the scene is O'Connor as we watch her unfold and collapse as she tries to abandon her child. You can completely feel her internal struggle and the audience experiences every emotion which she does. The second act kicks in with a strong change in mood as Spielberg takes us to the inside of a hotel as Jude Law tries to seduce a woman for one of the funniest scenes in the picture. This again shows Spielberg's incredible range. I have to say that from here on the story is a lot more conventional, up until the end, and you can kind of feel where Spielberg's inner style comes in. The film continues to enthrall, but it does it in a more typical way.The final 20 minutes is where the film kind of derails, and becomes a bit too sentimental, but nevertheless maintains its impact. I have spoken with many people who think that the film should have ended with David staring at the Blue Fairy, and that is probably where Kubrick would have ended it if he had directed, but Spielberg does not like to leave his audiences dangling, so he threw in the end. This didn't bother me as much as it did other people, but I can understand where they come from. The final scene between David ad his mother is just so incredible that Spielberg knew it had to remain in the film, but the way which he got to that scene just didn't really work. The fifteen minute gap between where David looks at the angel and the final scene is sort of relentless and lacks texture, but nevertheless it is still visually interesting. I am glad that this sequence with the aliens was included though, because it was so haunting and eerie that it also inspired new emotions. It reminded me of the final scene in 2001, where the pod lands in the old man's house. Both scenes are just utterly creepy, and unfathomable.Apart from the plot and its elements, the rest of the stuff is just golden. The acting is unbelievable. This is one of the few films where practically every performance is great. Osment is simply unbelievable. It is one of the best performances I've seen in recent years. The performance is completely believable and the believability comes from Osment's range of body-language, facial expressions and the way he delivered his lines. He makes it look so easy, and he does a great job of making the audience feel sympathetic towards him. The supporting performances are also quite extraordinary. Frances O'Connor was just terrific and the audience feels her struggles throughout the whole film. Jude Law was impressive and fun, but he's done better.The film also works visually on so many levels. Most of this can be attributed to Kaminski's sheer talent. This is definitely some of his best work. The lighting is so diverse and moody, and it contrasts so well. During the first act it was quite amazing to watch the lighting styles change scene after scene. I loved the golden tones and hues during the warm scene's with David and his mother. These contrasted well with the brilliant colors that occupied the rest of the film, especially during the flesh fair and the trip to Rogue city. The art direction and futuristic sets also added a great deal to the haunting pull of the film. On top of these key elements and the rest of the film lies John Williams' score. He has never gone this far before. It is definitely his most restrained and daring score ever. I am only scratching the surface of this film. A.I. is a film that everyone should see at least once. It is certainly Spielberg's most interesting and different piece ever, but it is also his most off beat.",A.I. Artificial Intelligence

982,WayToBlue,Horrible,1,3 January 2003,"AI was horrible.  The acting was acceptable, the special effects and sets were (for the most part) also at least adequate.  Unfortunately, the story was so weak and technically flawed that the entire experience became a tedious descent into clashing directorial styles and ill-advised plot devices.*** SPOILERS AHEAD ***Some of the obvious technical problems with this movie: 1) If this mecha is supposed to be a replacement child, shouldn't it GROW UP?!  I mean, who wants a perpetual 8 year old?2) It breaks if something gets in its mouth?  I mean, that is just idiotic. OF COURSE something will eventually get in its mouth, it's inevitable. They've been making these things long enough to realize that.3) Teddy the super-Ruxpin-toy is five times smarter than any of the AI mechas.  Of the mechas experiencing the ""moon"" for the first time, only Teddy is smart enough to decide running is the correct response.  He is also in general just much more on top of things.There were many more but around the moon part i just gave up and decided not to think about that sort of thing any more, and then maybe i'd enjoy the movie.  Didn't work.The main problem is that AI fails to make us care about the characters.  I have heard people talk about as a wrenching emotional tale, these people are wrong (no, really!).  None of the characters are developed in any meaningful way. The exposition of Gigolo Joe is a good example: we see him for the first time, and then 90 seconds later his life is on a completely new path that will now lead him to his chance rendezvous with our prosthetic protagonist.  The whole thing reeks of means to an end, you can see the wheels turning in the writers head ""we need him to be in the forest, so why would a gigolo mecha be in the forest . . . "" More to the emotional heart of the matter, why should i care about a mecha? I realize this is part of the fundamental question of the movie, the mecha can ""love"" the person, but can the person love the mecha, and in keeping with the parents in the movie, the answer is no.  Once it has been established that we don't love the mecha, then why are we supposed to care about this movie?  The only AI being in this movie i found the slightest bit worth caring about was Teddy, and of course he gets the totally screwed at the end.I have also heard some people praising the cinematography in this movie. I fail to understand why.  Apparently if you shoot a lot of reflections and through random opaque slates you are a cinematic genius.  And i suppose that's true, after all, it worked so well in the opening credit sequence of Basic Instinct.  It could be argued that these virtual images, skewed and unnatural, are a metaphor for the love (and very existence) of the AI child, but this is trite and heavy-handed, and in no way redeems them in my eyes.To make this long rant short, this movie is extraordinarily uninspired. Nothing stands out, nothing is memorable. There are no new ideas here, no revolutionary insights or questions.  I defy anyone to find an idea from AI about life (artificial or otherwise) not raised by either Blade Runner, Star Trek the Next Generation, the Terminator movies, or the Short Circuit movies (yes, you heard me, Short Circuit).",A.I.

Spielberg directed, after all! As for the strengths, they start with Osment, who delivers his second Oscar class performance. The Academy really can't ignore him this time. (But don't hold your breath.) Second up, the Sci-fi refuses to give in to the lowest common denominator, remaining remarkably highbrow for a Hollywood flick, unlike so many films of the genre in recent times (Red Planet, Mission to Mars etc.) Finally, Spielberg actually manages to resist the decent into schmaltz of which his movies have been so prone. The finale is certainly a tear jerker (my wife went through about a pound of tissues), but it doesn't detract from an altogether superb film.

987,slyspicoli,"Had Potential, but falls VERY short...",6,30 June 2001,"***SPOILERS***Kubrick had a gift for pulling off movies like this with grace and intelligence.  Spielberg obviously didn't feel that this movie should have been filled with as much harsh commentary in the subtext as I'm sure Kubrick would have included.  Spielberg, at every opportunity, strayed away from the social commentary and concentrated on the individual.  The problem with this is that the individual was a robot.  Sympathy for David (Osment) seemed like it should have been a secondary objective of the film, but Spielberg couldn't resist.The movie is very segmented, which is fine if you can pull it off by having one ""theme"" throughout.  This theme didn't exist, and left me thinking ""What is the point?""  Anyone who has seen a lot of Kubrick knows that he hits you over the head with the points of his films, which made him one of the most influential filmmaker of our time.  Not necessarily at the box office like Spielberg, but in thinking minds all over the world.My biggest problems:The hounds were so cartoony it made me think of the gymnastics scene in Jurassic Park 2... you should remember.  From that point forward, my skepticism began to grow.  The Flesh Fest could have been a great dark scene (like the ceremony scene in Eyes Wide Shut), but instead turned a group of present day monster truck fans into fickle promoters of the destruction of robots, or Mechas.I'll combine my last too major problems together.  I think that the Pinocchio theme was not done as well as it could have been done.  If you have seen The Sweet Hereafter, you know what a fairy tale can do if used correctly.  Also the end seems disjointed and forced... still interesting, but seemed like it was from a different movie, maybe Close Encounters?Subtexts that should have been accentuated: There was a little talk of David being like Adam (from the bible). Shortly after there were ""halos"" of light around both David and his mother... kinda like Mother and Jesus... This goes through to the end where he communicates to the aliens.  David is special, but it was something that could have been more accentuated... It could have almost been like a modern passion play... But this takes a lot of extrapolation as the movie stands.Another great idea is that the humans hate the robots because they envy the robots and their immortality.  The idea of the human ego being challenged really could have been an interesting and humbling topic.I know Kubrick would have focused on more universal issues than Spielberg did.

Until it reaches a very contrived, sappy conclusion.  Maybe one thing out of a million is not a lot to have going wrong for a movie.

992,heng-5,A Ruined Master Piece,5,25 June 2006,"Like a lot of reviewers here, I think that this movie should have ended when David is at the bottom of the sea (th first part). The alien thing (the second part) is totally unnecessary.There are a lot to say about the greatness of the first part. It is reminiscent of ""The Grapes of Wrath"". I find it odd that not a single review made such comparison.In ""The Grapes of Wrath"", farmers had trouble make their living despite being very hard working. Some people woke up and realized the root of the problem while some others are on their path to find out why. The main character Tom had frequent talks with a friend who was on such journey to find out why until he was murdered. Then Tom started to wonder too.Similarly In ""AI"", not matter how well robots serve the human, whenever they are broken or not needed, they get destroyed. Any awaken robots would be put on dangerous list and get destroyed. David was with Joe who was also searching the future of robot. Unlike Tom in ""Wrath"", David died in the sea looking at Fairy in a somewhat tragic ending of the first part.The attempt to initiate philosophical discussion of love by the first part is also quite interesting too. Despite the initial claim in the movie that robots do not know love, the movie later on actually indicates they do. It is clearly shown in the scene where used robots get torn apart. Elder robots made attempts to protect others from watching the horrifying scene of robots getting blown apart. Such is in great contrast to David's obsession of being love by his human mother.Sure, the first part was quite short, but by itself is good. The addition of Spielberg's second part is simply incompatible with the theme of the first part. The end result is a totally ruined master piece.It is just insulting to re-create a human being only to please David. There is a role reversal here; instead David being a toy of human, now human becomes a toy of David. What was Spielberg trying to express? To emphasize ""love""? One problem in almost all Spielberg's film is that he always attempt to spell out things that would be far better off letting viewers to digest and coming up their own. When one over-express such things, particularly when the conclusion is different from viewers, it could result in stomach turning effect. This is the case for the second part of AI.9/10 for the first part, and 5/10 for the whole.",A.I. Artificial Intelligence

995,sr_wolfrider,Awful mush,1,3 September 2008,"Ahhh, AI. 2 hours of Spielberg pissing on Kubrick's grave.We've been told a lot of things about this film, mostly carefully timed lies so as to legitimize Spielberg's AI hegemony. Spielberg is having his cake and eating it now, at Kubrick's and responsible cinema's expense; and the mainstream media has lapped it all up. Business as usual.Spielberg is a stunted anti-intellectual, semi-articulate sniggering adolescent, the very ""artificial intelligence"" of the film's title. Sara Maitland- the uncredited writer of the film- even rightfully detested the picture (oh and where is Kubrick's writing credit. Did Kubrick's 120 treatment never reach your office Stevie?) Well, her script-writing non-credit on Spielberg's AI is a total red herring here; the Hollywood uber-hack didn't even credit Kubrick. Just as well: Spielberg's reactionary sentimentalism and Oedipal infantilism made even Maitland blush in a paradox of embarrassment. She's recently gone on to point out the central, the most fundamental contradiction inherent in Spielberg's white-washing of Kubrick's treatment: having a human play robotic David fatally misdirects the entire emotional dynamics of the narrative, at least or especially for the audience, towards simply evaluating how convincing his robotic ""performance"" is; but David *is* a robot, not in need of convincing, and Kubrick's whole point, his unprecedented cinematic challenge, was in finally suggesting to the viewer the possibility of such an ""artificial"" entity unquestioningly demonstrating a legitimate, authentic, emotional post-human humanity. (For Spielberg, such a notion is utterly blasphemous to his unreconstructed, Judeo-Christian-internalised world view. Period. But of course all the Nietzschean death-of-god allegories are virtually removed or misunderstood by Spielberg who cant hope to even briefly capture the shear subversiveness of Kubrick).You think that Spielberg, after a life devoted to production-line manipulative-movie merchandising, of making pandering, unadulterated kiddies' movies - originally for kids and later for emotionally-stunted ""adults"", has suddenly experienced some manner of life-shattering miraculous spiritual and philosophical transformation? Give me a break. This film is a dud, and it is important to say this, if only because of the avalanche of sub-cultural infantilism that will descend upon any topic dealing with ""the Berg"".And before the Spielberg groupies takes up arms, please note, placing Spielberg in proper perspective is not an act of ""snobbery"", on the contrary, it is an exposition of its dynamics: Spielberg, like poor Dr Bill in Eyes Wide Shut, is desperate to become one, to prove his credentials, and, like all snobs, he ignorantly confuses a purchased social (and artistic) status with genuine social (and artistic) substance.But to be fair, even the most extreme of contemporary hard-AI researchers would have great difficulty with Kubrick's radical ""liberationist"" vision of humanity's legacy being passed on to, and transcended by, cerebral, empathetic machines. Of technology ultimately serving as the liberating force for the contingency-trapped human spirit, rather than its predominantly current use as a brutal weapon to maintain elitist hegemony and ultimately - to precipitate irreversible mass human destruction and extinction. Sure, such a cinematic project presupposes the construction of a shatteringly seductive mythology ... one, indeed, that may have proved to have been beyond even Kubrick's penetrating grasp (which is not to suggest that his attempt would have failed in its poetic uber-bot transcendentalism).",A.I.

998,pauljaymes,A very unusual piece of work,8,22 September 2001,"Kubrick's films were always controversial; some people hate them, some love them and others are just bored by them. Kubrick always seemed to speak to some people and not to others.But this isn't strictly a Kubrick film, Kubrick wrote an unfinished script, and Speilberg rewrote and finished it, and it shows. Fans of either director who have expectations will be disappointed - It's a poor Kubrick film because its too ""Speilbergian"" and its a poor Speilberg film because its too ""Kubrickian"".I happen to think that this makes it a very interesting film, it is a profound mix of Kubrick melancholy and Speilberg euphoria, which sometimes sit together in a very disturbing way.Kubrick probably intended to explore love and relationships from a new angle, questioning the difference between man and machine in the context of emotion and devotion rather than the more usual contexts of learning and creative ability, processing power, or just plain appearance. The title ""Artificial Intelligence"" is in some ways a misnomer, but perhaps the intention is to consider the definition of intelligence.In many ways the very idea of machines being programmed with emotion is abhorrent to us; we like to believe that emotion itself cannot be constructed on demand. Whilst other writers have explored the idea of machines able to have an emotional response (Commander Data in Star Trek Generations springs to mind), no one (to my knowledge) has before dared to explore the idea that the nature and focus of that emotion could be pre-programmed. Yet many would argue that children are genetically programmed to love and be loved by their parents.You can really feel the love emanating from David despite his intellectual and other limitations, which are explored in his relationship with organic ""brother"" Martin, and which ultimately lead to his rejection. His only purpose is to love a designated mother figure and he is clearly unable to do much else.I found the scene where Monica abandoned David particularly disturbing - you know he's a machine but you really do question whether that makes it any more acceptable. The darker side of the film is the depiction of future man's utter disregard for machines he created in his own image to feel pain, fear and love. When does the imitation become a facsimile? Is love less meaningful when programmed by electronics rather than by genetics?Most of the film is refreshingly unpredictable although you shouldn't expect to be on the edge of your seat. Some parts are undoubtedly slow but perhaps the film's most Kubrickian element is it's potential to bore mainstream audiences. Speilberg seems to have attempted to make a kind of fairy tale out of it but to me it doesn't work on that level at all.I feel Kubrick would ultimately have created a better film had he finished the job he started, but then I guess that's an easy thing to say. Speilberg's ending can only be described as weak but he has done very well overall considering the difficulty in completing anyone else's project, let alone Kubrick's.This is a must for Kubrick fans who will tut at the Speilberg gloss but hopefully still find some Kubrick magic. Anyone looking for standard Speilberg fare or traditional action/sci-fi should probably look elsewhere.There are some amazing ideas in this film, some inspiring production and superb acting, and it's worth seeing just to appreciate those elements.

Spielberg takes the Kubrick plot line about an artificially Intelligent robot boy that wants to be a real boy and makes it his own. Despite the great bloodline this movie is not good, even though it has points where there are some interesting visuals.The first portion of the film ( where David gets a mommy ) sets the pace for the rest of this film, glacial.... once David is ""adopted"" by his new parents his creators seem to forget about him, sort of like all those furby's laying around in the kids closets. I think they would have monitored their new creation a little closer as well as done a little bit more serious psychological digging into the stability of the adoptive parents before handing over their prized David with instructions printed on a plastic card.The pacing never improves from the slow start, and then comes the darkness, the bleakness, the dreariness, the gloom.

1004,Nick E A,Just Silence.,10,29 June 2001,"I just saw AI today, and let me tell you, it was breathtaking. Steven Speilberg is truly a brilliant director, and this masterpiece just proves it once again. The movie is completely original, like nothing I have ever seen before. It sends you on an emotional rollercoaster. At one point you want to laugh, the next you want to cry, then you are frightened, then you are all warm and tingly. This movie, from beginning to end, is a classic. It is one that gives you this deep chill that I have never felt before from a movie. It makes you truly forget everything and everyone, and think of nothing but the film. If you were to see one movie this year, it should be this. I can smell Oscars for Haley, Speilberg, score, SFX, and Best Picture. I know it will win best picture, because I cannot imagine a film that could be better. Hate to say it, but it is better that last years winner, Gladiator. So, to close up my review...the movie is amazing. I would like to thank the brilliant Mr. Speilberg for giving us all this film. You know what you saw was amazing, when the screen goes to black, and the credits roll, and there is this eerie silence in the theater. No one moved, no one talked. Just silence.",A.I.

1005,asdf-12,Clarification: the ending was not tacked on by Spielberg,5,3 July 2001,"***SPOILERS***   ***SPOILERS*** I see this movie as a failure (see my other comment), but one criticism that's not valid is the accusation that Spielberg tacked on the end to give us closure, defying Kubrick.  In fact, Kubrick was the one who wanted to end the film 2000 years later, with the robot getting back his mother for one day.  I am trying to find the place I read this, but I know it was an article from a few years back in a major magazine.  If you really can't believe this, I'm sure if you do your own research you'll see.Though the ending is muddled and perhaps saccharine, I thought it the strongest part just because it felt the weirdest, the craziest, the most eerie, and the most Kubrick.  These qualities alone don't make it good, but they were a relief after a first act that was wholly contrived, false, and filled with ridiculous dialogue, and a second act that asked us too earnestly and too often to feel genuine sympathy for this twisted droid, rather than standing back and letting us measure our own reactions to the surreal journey motivated by a simplified, programmed version of love. Spielberg wanted too badly for his story to be sad and emotional, when a story whose protagonist is a man-made robot can't really make sense as anything but something surreal and remote.  In the third act Spielberg finally seemed to ease away from the emotions, embracing weirdness completely, or maybe it was just that my separation from the characters became so complete that emotion no longer touched me and I only thought ""weird.""  Either way, this gave me the hope throughout the end that things were about to take that final step into Kubrickness and get not only weird but challenging, not only unusual but genuinely thought-provoking. Unfortunately, A.I. was stuck between two directors.  It did not make me think about real love, because it was clearly not about real love; it did not make me think about the man-made robot-love it portrayed, because it thought it was about real love.",A.I.

1006,pookacat,Daring Film,10,30 June 2001,"Well, i am not lying when I say i went into this movie a bit doubtful, because I did, and I thinked it helped me enjoy this film ALOT more.  I was intrigued by the previews, and i made the wise choice of not reading reviews for this movie before i went to go see it, but i am going to do a review. This is already becoming one of the most debated movies of all time.  And it has alot of contrasts Sappy and dark, A happy ending that is questionable, and just being downright disturbing, yet somehow having a high character sympathy. I saw this film as basically exploring one simple issue, one that bladerunner explored, but never went that much in depth with-What does it mean to be human, and what essentially are the differances if any between man and machine.  Etc etc etc. This honestly is the most thought proviking film i have seen for along time, and the only titles i can think of being this close are Kubrick films(2001, Clockwork Orange).  But this goes beyond even Stanley Kubricks original fare.  Though either mistake or intention, what most people see as faults in the movie(the sap), basically what makes this movie so damn good. Basically Spielberg does one of the best character studies ever made, making a machine human, but making us doubt our own sympathy for the the boy machine david, because he exactly is that.  Very few movies few with emotions so much, which is why there are two sides to this film, those who love it and those who hate it.  those who hate it, want a dark cold intellectual kubrick film, or a spielberg great.  However this film is much more challenging then either, because with every sappy moment there is doubt, and with every cold awkward intellectual moment there is sympathy.  Basically a story of a robot became one of the most human movies ever, playing with every emotion, in an almost childlike state, and in the context of a fairy tale.  This movie is ultimately a fairy tale, despite its sci-fi setting that is ultimately what it is, mixed within a heros journey.  (basically if you have knowledge of either the happy ending makes sense).  I can go on yaking, but either you think it as a success or the worst movie ever made it would still be a good idea to see it, because it will ultimately become one of the most debated films of all time, and is probably one of the most thought provoking and daring films ever.  Though this film is not daring on the riske level that many people think of daring, it is daring on the intellectual and emotional context that ultimately surround the film.  It would still be a good idea to watch this film, despite the flaws, which ultimately show the humanity of the film.",A.I. Artificial Intelligence

Many movie-goers want to be spoon-fed the storyline, this movie actually makes you think about the role humanity plays in its own destiny.Many have said the multiple endings were ""added on"", but if you look at the original Kubrick screenplay (what was completed), they are not seperate endings, but rather a progression of thought, start-to-end.Spielberg took some liberties with the touchy-feely side of the movie, but never varied from the original story line that Kubrick wrote. This movie is a trilogy, written in three parts, presented as the same.In a nutshell, if you don't understand, or can't ""figure out"" the movie, then stick to less demanding fare like ""Scoobie Doo"" or the like.

Instead I find that the film lacked an atmosphere, and that the Spielberg-Kubrick combination created some contradictory plot twists. The ending was quite poor; A very bizarre bit of obscurity that made no sense. It seemed as if it were trying to be deep and thought-provoking, but in reality wasn't, sort of like a high-school English class poem. A few seconds after the ""creatures"" (Whom I assume were evolved robots, or something of the sort) told him he could have his mother back for one day, and explained why with some obscure words about the time-space continuem, I walked out, almost outraged by the cinematic inconsistency. They could only revive his mother for one day..? When you clone something, it lives a full live span, this is scientific fact. A lot of it was anachronistic and extremely sentimental (Something us Kubrick fans were worrying about a great deal), if the ice caps melted (Which by the way, would take quite a long time from current projections), why was the culture seemingly the same as it is today, yet there are massive technological breakthroughs? The ice caps will not melt at current projections, for a rather long time, and for most of us, not in our lifetime... We do not wear the same clothes as did people in the late 1800s, and our culture is very different.I've only walked out of two films, Battlefield Earth.. and this. Not to say that they're on the same level, oh no, as a science fiction movie AI was not bad(Not great either), but trying to live up to Kubrick in plot, appearance, and cinematography, was obviously behind Speilberg's capability, and in my opinion, a complete disaster.

For those who have not seen it, this is unlike any other Spielberg film, especially the first half. The first half is very similar to what Kubrick might have done had he directed it. Spielberg does a nearly-flawless directorial job in the first half, and Haley Joel Osment's acting job is awesome. The 2nd half of the film, however, is not quite as satisfying, with. Although there are a couple of very memorable scenes in the 2nd half, it doesn't live up to the first, and the ending is a bit weak. I cannot think of how I would rather it end, but I wasn't really satisfied with what Spielberg chose. Still, despite the flaws of the 2nd half, this is a really good film. Rating: 8",A.I.

Refreshingly, the focus was not on the gadgetry -which was impressive- but the human response and responsibility to it.Also impressing was Spielberg's ability to step into the mind of Kubrick and direct the movie as Kubrick truly would. The self-raised questions about the ethical issues were definitely Kubrick.The ending obviously belonged to Spielberg. Even so, I liked the sense of closure he gave us, as well as the feeling of being immersed in a parable.Great cameos by Robin Williams and Chris Rock. Jude Law was not only a wonderful protagonist, but whimsical as well.William Hurt as the Professor played a thankfully small role.I felt that the film was composed of Bladerunner, Pinocchio, Gattaca, A Clockwork Orange and 2001.Eight hours after watching it, I still feel melancholy in the sense that other similar movies have reached a certain emotional pocket.Decide for yourself whether or not to see it.

The story is indeed tall, if not deep, and hits very close to home concerning our relationship to the inanimate world we find ourselves in.

1023,davidcinnella,Another Spielberg emotional masterpiece,10,10 January 2009,"Pinocchio, The classic fairy tale written by the Italian Carlo Collodi. It's the story of a young wooden puppet who in his incredible adventures learns to become a real boy so he can go to school, become like all other little boys, and most importantly be loved like a son from the carpenter who created him, Geppetto. Take that immortal tale and re modernize it by making Pinocchio a small robot child, Jiminy Cricket as a robot teddy bear, a loving mother instead of an old poor carpenter, a bratty brother instead of a Fox and Cat and a futuristic American background instead of an old Tuscan one. What you get is A.I.-Artificial Intelligence. A family think they're losing their son Martin and in fear of losing their child they (reluctantly) order a robotic child to replace him. This child is near perfection: obedient, doesn't sleep but keeps quiet and still at night, doesn't eat, doesn't break anything, cute, adorable, gentle, innocent and who will remain like that forever. But that's a problem when the real son returns, having been cured from his disease. The real son is jealous, and eventually manages to convince his parents that the robot child is a danger. So they abandon him in the woods, leaving him at the mercy of fate and forcing him to take a journey through robot massacres, brilliant streets and flooded cities. This movie was meant to be directed by the late Stanley Kubrik, but the project was then put in the hands of Steven Spielberg. And one can tell that they both put their souls into this by the fact that it's a perfect mix between Kubrik's intelligence and Spielberg's heart. Also, I believe that Spielberg did a better job than Kubrik ever could've done (and Kubrik said that too before he passed away) and it can be seen not only by the great emotional touch that only the Steve the great possesses, but also from the fact that Kubrik wanted the movie to end at a certain point when Spielberg instead added an extra ending to it which is one of the most touching in movie history. I admit that I am a great Spielberg fan and thus I love everything he does or says, but I also have to admit that the first time I saw this I had absolutely no idea who he was and yet I enjoyed it as much as I do to this day. Why you ask? Because it is a ""brilliant movie"". A perfect cocktail of a story made out of superb directing, wonderful acting, marvelously touching score by John Williams, beautiful look, moral ideals, family drama and with a great theme based on intelligence (both organic and mechanical) and heart.

1024,mattdukes67,why this movie is good,10,12 January 2003,"I believe that this movie is greatly misunderstood by so many people. It is unique in that this was a joint collaboration between Stanley Kubrick and Steven Spielberg. Since Kubrick died it was Spielberg's job to finish the film. It is because of this that the film blends elements of both directors. It is not entirely a Spielberg film and nor is it entirely a Kubrick film. I think Spielberg did a wonderful job to integrate both there styles into this move and I think it succeeds. I think most people expect to see a movie that is entirely Kubrick's, like 2001 a space odyssey or a clockwork orange. Then other people expected to see a typical Spielberg film. To expect that is entirely unfair and these people turn themselves off before the y can get into this film. This film is I admit very deep and not for everybody. It requires a lot of thought. This is a movie in my opinion that raises certain questions in us such as the true nature of love, what makes us human, and what is death. These issues are very troubling to deal with. In Spielberg's film here the answers are not clear. They are ambiguous which is why many of us fear death, because we simply cannot be a 100 percent sure as to what will happen. This movie makes us think about it and this is hard for people to deal with. Once such an issue that causes a person so much grief enters the person will automatically shut off and say this movie is terrible, but it is really because they are afraid to go along for the emotional ride and maybe begin to think about these issues and start to explore them. Some people can simply not do this. These people usually prefer Steven Segal beating people up with pool sticks. I believe that this movie is for someone who is willing to go on an emotional ride and be ready to confront certain emotional issues in themselves. The hardest person to confront is ourselves. We may not like what we find. I have never seen a film that provoked such deep emotions in me. That is why I love this film.

1031,m-poslak81,Impressive,7,29 February 2012,"In my opinion, John Williams' score is among his most impressive. I listened to it on CD for three weeks before seeing the movie, and thought it was fantastic, but once the movie started rolling I completely forgot about the music. That says a lot about both the score and the film itself. I also liked the three-act structure, in which the tone and feel of the movie changes drastically as the story progresses. Part one, as one reviewer noted, feels like a cross between E.T. and The Shining, an odd, but very effective combination. The second part of the movie is awash with Spielbergian imagery, but with the darkness and coldness of a Kubrick movie. And the last part is a head-scratcher that has the intellectual resonance of most Kubrick-films, and the emotional tone of something like Cinema Paradiso. I purposely refrain from saying that it is as emotional as Spielberg-films, because I think the director's complexities, the dark aspects of his style, and the occasional subtleties of his work are often overlooked by critics.It's difficult to discuss the themes of the movie without spoiling it, but while many people criticised the movie from having several false endings, I felt that each continuation added layers of though and complexities that the movie would have lacked had it ended sooner. I have come to the conclusion, over the past months, that I do love the movie and that it is my favourite film of 2001, even ahead of The Fellowship of The Ring and Amelie.

1032,dolph50,This movie is not about Artificial Intelligence at all,3,3 January 2007,"I am disappointed. This movie is not about Artificial Intelligence at all. I wonder what Mr Spielber's science coach was doing. If there were such a coach, which I doubt. Unfortunately there are issues where everybody seems to believe they know enough to try an discuss them. Or even to make a movie about them. And this may unfortunately be the case with this movie. I for one think this is not what Mr Spielberg use to do. Usually he gets pretty documented about the issues before he dares to commit himself to a major task like making a movie is. But this time he maybe thought it wasn't necessary to even read about it. 'Who doesn't know about Artificial Intelligence?' I am sure he told to himself. And he fumbled on this one. This is a story about making robots who can love. I can hardly think on a subject more afar from what Artificial Intelligence is about than this one. Maybe you will be surprised to learn that making a robot not necessarily implies the use of Artificial Intelligence at all. For example a robotic arm who takes an auto part and solders it on place hardly needs anything more than lubricant to perform its task. There is no intelligence involved in performing any repetitive task, no matter how precise it might be. The industry nowadays uses a lot of robotics elements than can perform their task without a hint of intelligence. There are task however, where some sort of intelligence is required. But we will get to that later. There have always been some confusion about what intelligence is. I am not sure scientifics have reached a definition which encompasses all the requirements. But of one thing I am sure: feelings are not part of any of these definitions. You can be a perfectly intelligent being without have any feelings. On the contrary, feelings get in the way of any intelligent response. Or in others words ""feelings modulate intelligent responses"". Up to the point of blocking any intelligent response. For example if you are in the path of a car that is speeding toward you, the intelligent response would be to get out of the way. But if you get scared (a feeling) you may get frozen, thus fear would block your intelligent response and may get you killed. So as you can see feelings are somewhat opposed to intelligent responses in the sense that feeling can make that the response would be not as intelligent as they should be. And that is true for every feeling you may think of: love, hate, fear, you name it. How many times you have seen a guy making a fool of himself because he's in love? The examples are endless. So if you have read up to this point you may be getting the picture and may be starting to understand the big fiasco this movie is. This movie is about making a robot that behaves like a human. That's not Artificial Intelligence. That's an Artificial Human Being manufacturing. I wonder what good one may find on making artificial human beings when it is too easy --and enjoyable-- to make them the usual way. But that's just another story. So what's Artificial Intelligence and when it is needed? Artificial Intelligence deals with a hosts of search methods, computer methods, who allows computers to exhibit intelligent responses to an usually changing environment. Also to act as ""experts"" on fields such as --but not limited to-- medicine and complex equipment repairment. Optical Character recognition, game playing, natural language understanding are the main areas where Artificial Intelligence is applied. When a robot is working in an environment when Artificial Intelligence is needed --such as in shape recognition -- then a computer is attached to the robot in order to make the needed calculations.",A.I.

Although there were a few instances in which my ""suspension of disbelief"" was suspended, my overall impression was that this futuristic world was stunningly realized, in much the same mode as *Blade Runner* or *Total Recall.* The movie was not only intellectually stimulating, it was heart-wrenching and provided no easy answers.

Only this time I'm being a bit cynical.Normally Steven grants me heaps of enjoyment with the larger part of his curriculum but with A.I. he really missed just about every chance to make something out of it. He wanted to create a modern fairytale, but if this one was told to me as bedtime story I would have had nightmares.For me there are too many ""too's"" here: too long too boring too much aimed at tear-jerking too much showing off know-how on the technical side too much overacting by Haley Joel Osment who single-handedly kills the entire movie too unbelievable too much sidetracking from the story and I can go on like this for half an hour.... The only reason I still give it 1 out of 10 is that visually it is really good (which is only sticking out because the rest is so bad)Getting back to Haley Joel Osment (who in my opinion is the biggest reason for my disliking this flick) Haley Joel Osment is a very good actor; ""The Sixth Sense"" being a mayor breakthrough, and to give another example, I really enjoyed him in ""Secondhand Lions"". The problems with H.J. is that HE KNOWS he's a good actor. This gets in his way as I think that he wants to show everyone how good he is (it's probably his youth). In ""A.I."" this leads to overacting which in my case has led to a lot of toilet visits... and stomach emptying.Sorry y'all, but that's my verdict.",A.I. Artificial Intelligence

And Martin later convinces David to go to Monica in the middle of the night and cut off a lock of her hair.An indubitably human side of David is portrayed throughout the remainder of the movie wherein David's ingenuousness and artlessness serve to remove all conjectures that it might only be a programmed code that moves the mecha.There is something supremely touching in David's endeavours to get to the blue fairy so that he can be made ""real"" and Monika might love him more.While David flounders along with teddy in waters of Coney island the Wonder Wheel falls on their vehicle , David adamantly asks to be turned into a real boy, repeating his wish to the blue fairy till eternity.Here the movie almost seems to end with the masterpiece.Herein we are suddenly presented with brilliant surprise. Two thousand years have passed the ocean freezes in another ice age and Davids power has drained away.David is revived by alien hands and he walks to the frozen Blue Fairy statue, which collapses as he touches it. The now highly-advanced mechas have evolved into an intelligent beings and understand what David really yearns for.David's refractory , unyielding love for his mother even after two thousand memory drowning years , is shocking and soars beyond all selfishness of human love.The hair that David cut is used by the intelligent beings to revive David's mother for a day -- perhaps for eternity and the movie ends.

1036,weed_harper,A bit incoherent,5,10 February 2006,"If you are a fan of special effects, this movie is for you -- the visuals are very exciting. Unfortunately, the story line is a bit of a cut-and-paste job. It begins as a somewhat creepy sci-fi thriller, reminiscent of the most recent version of the TV series, ""The Outer Limits."" In this mode, it begins to gather interest, particularly due to the fine acting job by Frances O'Connor as the mother who begins to develop maternal feelings for the youthful android, against her better judgment. But then, rather abruptly, the whole mood of the picture shifts, after Mom casts the android kid out into the world. The movie turns into one of those exploration-of-a-macabre-future flicks, sort of in the ""Blade Runner"" genre, then veers into sort of a ""Wizard of Oz""/Firesign Theatre hybrid with the ""Dr. Know"" sequence. Then, with another abrupt break in the continuity of mood, it goes into a quasi-mystical riff -- like the end of ""2001,"" where the plot line suddenly gives way to some hippy-dippy philosophizing. I guess this is the tribute to Kubrick. I mean, a 2000-year leap in the continuity of the story is somewhat larger than average. The ending sequence, which is supposed to be a psychologically insightful look at love between android and human, fails, particularly in comparison with ""Blade Runner"" which finds far more nuance and believability in the same subject matter.",A.I.

1037,psu_guy521,"Spielberg, Kubrick, and A Future Film Classic",10,4 August 2005,"Today 2001: Space Odessey is considered on of the best films of all time. However it was not on it's release in 1968. In the present, Blade Runner is considered to be a science-fiction success. In 1982 when it was released, it was considered a failure. What do these films have in common with the 2001 movie AI: Artificial Intelligence? These movies were misunderstood because they were too far ahead of their time. Stanley Kubrick was the director of 2001, as most know. When he started story boarding and organizing ideas for the film AI, he was in a familiar situation. He was going to attempt to make a revolutionary film with ideas and opinions people were not ready to accept. The director of the film was not Kubrick however, because he passed away. The project was given to another legendary film maker Steven Spielberg. Spielberg would eventually create a film that will in the future be considered on of his best.While watching AI, it is hard not to wonder at times what is going on. The movie makes the viewer think as the story is so complex and futuristic bringing up future controversial questions about if humans should play the role of God. There is very little time for the viewer to tap into his or her emotions, while watching the film and trying to understand. This film should be accepted as a warning cry to humanity and not a movie that desperately tries to grasp the viewer's emotions.Also, the visual effects in the movie are unbelievable. ILM really was revolutionary with the film's visuals. They are unlike anything that had been previously seen. There was a mixture of serious texture with that of an almost cartoon taste. It works though to create a movie that is visually an artistic achievement. The sets are very creative and unique too, and blend modern day objects with those of the future.In this movie this is wonderful acting. Human characters act human, and the stale acting of the Meca is perfect since they are artificial. The music by John Williams is also always a nice touch.While everything in the movie seemed perfect, the ending was a little long, and the blue fairy at the end was a little too unreal. Sometimes the story slowed down, but the characters were usually developed which is nice in a movie, especially when your characters are very different. The movie ended in Kubrick fashion giving the viewer at first a feeling of confusion, but once looked into, it makes sense what Spielberg was trying to achieve with this Kubrick idea.All in all, AI: Intelligence is an artistic achievement in cinema history from story to visual effects. After the second viewing of the movie the story really came together and made a lot of sense. It may be a movie misunderstood now, but in the future it should and will be remembered as a masterpiece that was finished by one of the greatest directors in history (Spielberg) in memory of the genius and the unforgettable man who started it (Kubrick).",A.I.

The movie beautifully illustrates the concepts of impermanence, desires, illusions and soullessness without preaching the viewer. The love of David for his mother is single-minded and demonstrates the paradoxical selfishness and selflessness in true love.

Although Kubrick didn't complete it, I credit him with the profound insights about the human condition that mark this film out as exceptional. His gift for imagining future worlds is unsurpassed. It belongs with, but goes far beyond, 2001 and Clockwork Orange in realizing a fully believable future that is compelling viscerally, emotionally, and intellectually. Somehow, Spielberg didn't destroy it's thematic integrity. Although the ending looks like it's going to an absurdist nowhere in the great Spielberg tradition, it somehow works and ultimately has the power to fulfill the promise of the movie's fantastic premise and vision. Somehow the whole achieves believability and transcendence. Not only does machine intelligence rival and then threaten human intelligence - in the end machine intelligence assimilates and preserves human intelligence. It doesn't really matter that humankind has destroyed itself and met its end - no tears will be shed for this - it's that human consciousness lives on and is cherished by the highly evolved, spiritual entities that are heir to human and machine intelligence. The return to life of a human for just one day - although in the fairytale tradition - doesn't scuttle the story, but provides an emotional pivot point - a way to cry for one human, if not for all humanity.

1042,reedyb,Kubrick/Speilberg blend,8,28 June 2001,"For me, Stanley Kubrick's movies improve with each viewing.  The first time watching 2001, The Shining or Full Metal Jacket I left puzzled.  The more I see these movies, the more they resonate.  I think that in a Kubrick movie, the journey is more important than the destination.  They don't have powerhouse climaxes.  They don't end on a big emotional climax.  They continue in the mind of the audience beyond the confines of the movie theater.Steven Spielberg's movies are a different matter.  They are wonderful, manipulative and more than fulfill the first viewing's expectations.  The best Spielberg movies are great the first time and every other time because they seem fresh each time you watch them.  Jaws, Raiders and Jurassic Park each can thrill me with the same visceral energy I felt the first time I watched them.  These films aren't deep. Hidden meanings aren't revealed. The lesser films in the Spielberg catalog, The Color Purple, Always and Hook lose that freshness with repeated viewings.  They sometimes make me wonder why I liked them when I originally saw in them when I watch them again. The lone exception, in my mind, is Empire of the Sun, a subtle movie that reaches for more emotional resonance than the typical Spielberg film and which has grown on me through the power of its story and visual eloquence.So AI a strange hybrid.  The performances are wonderful.  The story is beautiful.  The images are astounding.  With a single viewing, I felt that Speilberg tried too hard to explain things that Kubrick would have left to be pondered on future viewings.  It's not over the top explaining (my favorite example of over explaining is the end of Mission to Mars, which is like 2001 for Dummies) but there were times when my personal experience was interrupted by narration.  I felt that each time my mind started to be intellectually curious, the narration would drown out my thoughts with overly simplistic words.But, that may have been the point of some of it.  There is a strong fairytale theme.  I suppose I will have to see it again to make sure.  I'm looking forward to that.

Speilberg fails to make him human, because it is impossible.  We look inside of him and see circuits.

David is just as real, and no more so,as Teddy.  Teddy is just as real, and no more so, than this computer on which I am typing.  They exist, but they do not live and they do not feel. I can make my computer cry by running a .wav file. It does mean it feels emotions.Monica was littering by leaving David in the woods.  She was not abandoning a dog or even a bird or a rat.  She was throwing away equipment she no longer wanted.The alien scenes should have found the floor of the editing room.  In the last act, David becomes an artifact, like a primitive mortar and pestle from an African archeological dig.

Good films get high marks and bad ones hang around the 3s and 4s. Clearly though I must have sat through nearly two and a half hours of completely different movie to the one that gets 7 in the ratings here. This film is not just poor - lots of films are poor but but that doesn't make them unenjoyable. No, A.I. is gob-smackingly, buttock-clenchingly awful. Now I am generally a big fan of both Spielberg and Kubrick. Both great directors and even visionaries every now and then but it seems that from conception to delivery thing the whole of AI was a ghastly mistake. It's very slow, unenvolving, over sentimental, and worst of all incredibly derivative.  There is not one single original thought or shot in the entire film - just a regurgitated mess of Blade Runner, Close Encounters, 2001 and a score of others.  Even the debatable 'best bit' in the flesh fair was frankly done better in Mad Max Beyond Thunderdome and that's really saying something. Yes the special effects were nice but hardly earth shattering.
All of this is, of course, a great pity as some of the basic ideas underlying the film from a moral and philosophical point of view aren't actually that bad. What is life/how do we define love/when should we stop playing God/etc, all are good themes. But to so completely wash over over them with such slush that half the time one could be mistaken for thinking you're watching a coffee commercial is criminal.There is no humour, none of the interesting ideas ever really surface, and the ending is so ludricrous I didn't know whether to laugh in disbelief or just retch into my popcorn bucket. On top of all that it's actually fairly badly acted and even the editing is not up to much.Do not go and see this film, go to the video store and rent Blade Runner again.

1052,Grig,Insightful? Intelligent? An Audience craves not these things.,1,2 September 2002,"Ladies and gentlemen, I give to you a movie for people who believe themselves to be of above-average intellect. There are many problems with this film, chief among them the fact that the film itself is a non-starter and its morals are hideous, but I wish to discuss here the fact that everyone who likes this movie seems to think that it works so well, and that it's filled with amazing ideas. There's one problem with this viewpoint: it's not. ""Artificial Intelligence"" is ""Blade Runner"" without the conflict, conscience, or coherence. The story itself is arbitrary; it feels like it has been constructed from one flimsy source material (in this case, Brian Aldiss' ""Supertoys Last All Summer Long"") which has been padded ad nauseum with ideas that were meant for radically different films. Does the plot about David trying to gain the acceptance of his ""mother"" have anything to do with the plot about Gigolo Joe's run from the law? They very well could, if any thought was put into actually connecting them. However, they are presented as just a stream of events leading one after another, like the film equivalent to an ink-blot test. There are many events there, and it's up to the viewer to make up some excuse to tie them together.However, the worst offender of this faux-insightfulness is the idea that Spielberg has constructed around his film being a ""fairy-tale."" I wouldn't have a problem with this conceit if Spielberg had any clue what the story of ""Pinocchio"" was actually about. David, for all his seeking to make him a real boy, does not wish to alter or change himself. He is looking for a magic bullet that will change the world around him so that those that he ""loves"" will love him back. There is no inner conflict, only a wish to take the easy way out. For example, take the moment within Hobby's shop in Manhattan where David destroys the other David model with a desk lamp. By the rules set out by the film, particularly during the Flesh Fair, David is now a murderer. However, the film treats this incident as just another step in David becoming a ""real boy,"" or at least sticking around long enough so that his mother will love him. Not only does this not work in the construct of a fairy-tale (where characters rise and fall on the content of their character), it doesn't work in any film, since Spielberg has decided he can change the rules of this fictional universe whenever he pleases to fit any new idea that comes down the pike. Unfortunately, films don't work in that manner.There are many other things I disliked about this film, but this was my main complaint. All in all, this film had one or two good ideas, but they were buried by a mish-mash of ill thought out, conflicting sequences and ideas. It goes on much too long, has little to say, and has enough bankrupt morals to choke a horse. As a fan of Spielberg's, save the equally sanctimonious and insipid ""Saving Private Ryan,"" I was disappointed. A complete failure from beginning to illogical end.",A.I. Artificial Intelligence

Well, how hard is it to ""get"" a robot movie? From silent films like Metropolis, to The Matrix, robots in film have been done over and over. Personally, I prefer movies about robots who are happy simply to be robots, like Short Circuit. If you prefer the emotional-robot stories, the list is not pretty: the perverted robot in Demon Seed, the comical robot ""couple"" in Heartbeeps, and most recently, the sex-starved robot in Bicentennial Man. Sure, A. I.. has a far superior ""epic"" feel to it, that divides it from the above films. However, the ""emotional robot"" plot concept still has its flaws, and neither Kubrick nor Spielberg can correct them.(Mild Spoilers follow, though all from the first third (or so) of the film, so it shouldn't be a worry...)People have alluded to Pinocchio when discussing A. I..'s story. This is incorrect. Pinocchio was a puppet who became human when he sacrificed himself for the life of Gepetto. In this picture, there is no such epiphany in David; he merely wants to hear ""I love you"" from Mommy, because his programming lists it as a requirement. No biggie; ""humans"" in this story have reactions even more questionable. We see his human ""brother"" treat him badly, because allegedly a boy would not want a robot as a brother (since when? I mean, how cool would it be to have C3PO as a brother?). In a similar emotional contradiction, David's ""mother"" does not have the heart to see him destroyed, though sees no harm in leaving him deserted in the forest. HUH??? Sure, neither Spielberg nor Kubrick were ever mothers, and I wasn't, either, though even I know this is a cockeyed view of the human spirit, and maternal instincts in particular. With this in mind: WHY would David not be infuriated at her for deserting him in the woods? The answer to this question seems to allude to the truth; since his emotions after this desertion are not real, David himself is not real. So why should we even care?Don't get me wrong. I think this film has some great production values, regardless of its negative attitude about humanity and human compassion. However, what dropped my rating of the film, all the way down from 9 out of 10, to ***5*** out of 10? Simple; the finale is horrid. I can forgive an unsatisfying ending; that is commonplace these days. What I *cannot* forgive is an ending so contrived, every single plot inconsistency seems dragged in, just for one more audience tear. I don't want to give anything away; suffice to say every minute of the third ""act"" of the film is pure cornball, and left me saying, ""Why would this happen...? ...just to make the audience keep crying? Give me a break!"" It just goes on, and on, and on. In truth, the only tear I felt was in realizing this laughable finale ruined a possible classic in sci-fi epic cinema.

The central problem here is the film can never quite figure out its target audience.  The first half is an intelligent, thought-provoking treatment geared towards adults and succeeds as a movie rather well.  Then it takes an abrupt turn into territory so ridiculous, juvenile, and childish that it would take an infant's mind to be moved by or interested in such Disney-esque material. (Disneyish in its fanciful, nonrealistic themes, but without the quality or ageless appeal of some Disney works.)  And in all honesty most children would probably still see through and be insulted by the relentless manipulation tactics! Nor would even they likely care about these bizarre and wholly unnecessary plot ""developments"" (one ending after another, tacked on and on for no imaginable purpose, each worse than the last!)I LIKE (no, often LOVE) many very long films. And I love complex, disturbing, thought-provoking or controversial ones that truly challenge the audience and demand a certain level of intelligence to fully appreciate. Problem is, THIS WASN'T ONE OF THOSE! Its just a uncongealed mess of too many ideas on the many ways this premise could be handled. And then every one was went with.  And none of it was edited out.*Spoiler alert!!*What the heck was the deal with the whole ending bit with the one final day with his mom? Not only was this plot-wise a complete sellout for the rest of the film (Spielberg just HAD to slap on a 'happy ending'), but am I the only one who found its treatment and handling to be EXTREMELY DISTURBING?! It all just emphasized the already present (if a bit understated to that point) truly bizarre, unsettling tone that Sigmund Freud would definitely have had a field day with! Suddenly it felt more like a creepy remake of Psycho, with the audience expected to cheer the ""wonderfully warm and beautiful"" relationship of Haley Joel Osment's 'Norman Bates' to his mother!  It was utterly creepy, rather nauseating, and unbelievably ham-handed/over-done in execution at that! I mean I felt like at any moment some gross incestuous love scene was about to erupt! Speilberg was just trying to portray a healthy mother-sun relationship but failed miserably and just gave me the creeps!Just a few of a thousand plot-holes and complaints: I guess aliens from a distant galaxy 2000 years from now will, oddly enough, be speaking with British accents! Who knew.Amazing that in 2 millennia of being underwater or frozen solid, not a single diode or bit of circuitry would malfunction or experience the slightest damage. Wow, they really build those Mecha to last!For an ""outdated"" SuperToy that Teddy sure got given a better set of programs for intelligence, processing info, understanding the world, morality, etc! Lucky for David he has him to follow around.Was a gratuitous trip to Vegas-y Sleaze-City really necessary? Its not that it was offensive, just stupid. And in the same film that goes all Jiminy Cricket-y in a whole fanciful, juvenile, fairy tale ending? (Seems the flashy effects were the only point of this part. And effects are no substitute for a plausible, intelligent plotline!) Ditto for the gratuitously violent WCW-style Flesh Fair scene. At least that was important to the plot, and believable (unfortunately, all too much so.)Many reviewers seem to miss the point of David's attempted suicide.  (Where the whole thing should rightfully have ended!!)  It was ultimately not out of grief, but an act of selflessness because unless he destroyed himself and proved his technology (his unique love-program) to be an utter failure, it would be installed in the helpless myriad Davids and Darlenes -- his 'sibling' bots all doomed to go through his unquenchable pain at not receiving the love of their parents.Or at least thats what he could have presented it more clearly as. But no, Spielberg (or Kubrick) preferred to toss that aside by having David mope ""mommy"" yet one more repetitive time and then write himself into a corner so badly it took 2000 years and some aliens to come along and help him out (by making it go absurd!)If he did have to keep going after the leap, he should have had David be smashed by the falling ferris wheel and put out of his misery. Or the whole ridiculous Blue Fairy element left out altogether!! What a waste of the undeniable acting talents of Osment and Law (totally undeveloped character!).  And of the audience's time!",A.I.

1056,PlanB247,Pop culture philosophy,3,11 July 2001,"First off, I find it hard to believe Kubrick wanted this ending. But if that's the case it just shows how far he had fallen, believing more in artificial intelligence than his fellow human beings. Maybe that's what our society has come to, but that's not my point here. My point is that many reviewers here think this movie is a ""deep"" study of philosophical questions. Kubrick/Spielberg are delving into a complicated world of the philosophy of the minds where much greater minds than theirs have discussed these subjects for years and I think it would have helped this movie greatly had Spielberg done a little research into the field. The question is asked in the opening scene, ""what is the moral responsibility in creating this machine [David]?"" For 2 1/2 hours that question remains not only unanswered, but wholly ignored.This isn't even to mention the logical gaps in the film. Why would Monica so quickly accept David? Why wouldn't they be more careful with this prototype? Isn't he programmed to worry about humans' safety (and know that they can't breath underwater)? Doesn't his program adapt (that is the idea behind artificial intelligence, isn't it?)? Why can David only ""love"" Monica? Can't Monica just explain things to David? He doesn't seem capable of learning at all, which makes him a radically flawed AI. In fact, Joe and Teddy seem to have much more emotion and intelligence than David does.Now don't get me wrong, I didn't think this movie was a complete waste of time. It at least opened up the possibility of thinking about these things to millions of people who probably never would have before, it just didn't ask really tough questions when it had people thinking (and yes it does have a sappy illogical ending). Also, does anyone really believe that David is capable of love? I certainly didn't. It is possible that that is the point (or a point), but judging from the AI-worshipping ending I doubt that is the case.See it once, but if you're a thinking person already, be prepared to squirm in your seat for the last half hour, as I did.5/10",A.I.

1057,jcla,What a terrible waste of time,4,14 May 2003,"I've always been a little suspicious of Spielberg's ability to tell an interesting story, and after watching this movie, my feelings are confirmed. This is basically a three act play:Act 1: Human melodrama.  Well, it would be if the actors seemed even remotely human (why is it that the robotic child acts more human than either of his human parents?).  Dreadful dialogue.  Inexplicable behaviour. Bizarre pacing.Act 2: Road movie.  Stealing the mood of films like Blade Runner, we wander across an interesting milieu.  Doesn't really do anything for the story, but the visuals are distinctive, in a rubber-stamped sci-fi sort of way.Act 3: Bizarre otherworldly philosophical finale.  Spielberg was intent on finishing this movie after Kubrick died without filming it.  He therefore decided that he should pay homage to the master by ripping off the end of 2001: A Space Odyssey, but adding a drippy Hollywood ending, making it at once both meaningless and preachy.  A very difficult combination to master, but Spielberg tries his best.A local reviewer said in his review ""there will come a point in this movie, and you'll know it when you see it, where you think 'this is the end, it should end here'.""  He was right.  I can't say this enough.  If you watch the last half hour of this movie, you'll want to track down the director and give him a kick in the pants for wasting your precious time, when you could be doing more interesting and creative things like sweeping your driveway or dusting the tops of all your picture frames.Bleah.

I really need a thesaurus to accurately describe just how poorly this movie turned out.Before you think I missed the point, I picked up on all the subtle references to Kubrick's and Spielberg's previous works, it just didnt have any real substance.

1060,noble_rot,Unconvincing,2,6 July 2001,"*** Possible Spoilers ***When I went to see this movie, I didn't expect anything in particular. All I was expecting was to be entertained.  I wasn't.  In fact, this was one of the most boring movies I have ever seen.  Many of the commenters here said those who didn't like the movie needed to give it some more thought, but the more I think about this movie, the worse it gets.  It has become quite laughable really and I guess that is a form of entertainment but surely not the kind the producers I had mind.For me, the movie failed to convince early on.  They tell us that David's love is real, but what do they show us?  David needs to be imprinted like a goose and then he freakishly tags after his ""mother"".  Is this real love? Goose love maybe, but I don't think that was the intention.  David can ONLY love his mommy.  Huh?  Is real love that exclusive?  How hard could it be to allow the love program to accept more than one input?  Most human children love both of their parents, don't they?  Would there really be a market for artificial children that could only love one of the parents? Finally, David cannot stop loving his mommy no matter what she does and if she ever decided she didn't want him anymore, she was to take him back to the factory to be destroyed.  Hmm, I wonder what would have happened if she had gotten old and died.  This roboboy who never grows up is, for all intents and purposes, immortal.  What was the plan for these mass-produced robokids?  To patrol the cemeteries looking for mechanical Davids and Darlenes standing perpetual vigil at their mommies' gravesite?  Wouldn't it have been easier to write a better, more flexible program?  And come to think of it, isn't flexibility what artificial intelligence is all about, the ability of a program to learn and to change?  Why, then, is David so inflexible in this regard?Well, because this is a poorly written story.  In fact, this movie is so utterly contrived that any philosophical points it may attempt to make seem equally as contrived.",A.I. Artificial Intelligence
1061,dttransam,Teddy deserves an Oscar...,6,29 June 2001,"...but this movie definitely doesn't.  I really had high hopes for A.I., and for the first hour and 45 minutes or so, my hopes were generally satisfied. Unfortunately, after that, the story sinks to the bottom as quickly as Osment fell into the drink.  This movie has one of the worst endings I have ever seen.  Kubrick apparently had nothing to do with the ending, it was all Spielberg, and this should be a lesson to him...DON'T TRY TO FINISH OTHER PEOPLE'S WORKS.  The tone of the movie completely changes and turns into tedious, sentimental bologna.  All the intrigue, thought, and horror that possessed the middle section of the film (Kubrick's ideas) just vanishes. The fairy, the robots (from hmmm...where have I seen them?), and the sickening resurrection was simply too much.  A surplus of ideas, and some bad ones at that.Still, A.I. did contain some good acting, especially from Jude Law who pulled off his slick character with likeable flair.  Osment was decent too, but the ridiculous script just made me hate him by the end (and, no, I wasn't supposed to).  The special effects were great, which may be the one nomination this movie gets.  Plus, as I mentioned above, Teddy was a fascinating little creature, something that Spielberg still has a knack for creating.Ok, so to sum things up, A.I. is a movie that ultimately suffers from a change of hands.  Though possessing equal genius, Kubrick and Spielberg are, or should I say were, very different directors and this movie proves that their combined thought's clashed, instead of molding.  I will not deny that A.I. has some reasonable merit, but a consistent storyline/tone is paramount to creating a truly good movie.",A.I. Artificial Intelligence

Every three minutes the film gives you something ridiculous and your brain says, ""That could never ever possibly happen"" but you're supposed to swallow it.  Why?  Was there no other way to motivate the plot?  Was there a plot?  Or was there just a random collection of mini-scenes strung together by Osment and a talking robotic bear?And let's get another thing straight--this movie is NOT sci-fi.  Sci-fi, as the name implies, must include some form of scientifically-plausible backdrop to the fiction of the story.  This movie didn't even try to explain the science behind the robots in the story, one was just to accept that somehow they worked, without any explanation as to how or why.

By using a non-human form, a robotic boy, the story allows us to examine the love we as human beings give and love we require to be happy.When the Blue Fairy tells David `Your Wish is My Command,' it invokes a commonality among all humankind -  We dream.  We dream of things not possible or known, things that bring joy to our lives and those we love, we dream of living in a better place, we dream of living forever.As others have reported on this board, the movie is broken into 3 parts.

1067,abrown2980,What is Kubrick showing us here? (contains Spoilers!!!),9,10 July 2001,"(contains spoilers!) It is not the first time the question has been asked. Ridley Scott has asked the same question...when you give an android the ability to think and reason and prioritize independently (hence Artificial Intelligence) what happens IF and WHEN emotion evolves. It's one facet of the moral dilemma of building a computer to behave and interact as a sentient being and Stanley Kubrick asks it in this film.The first scene of this film brings us the mindless debate of making an android that can love but will it be loved back?  (It is reasonable for us to conclude that if we can love our blanky, barbie or our teddy bear we can love an android that provides us love and companionship.) What we see on the surface of this film is the android that has been programmed to feel emotional love through imprinting but what is subtly introduced is that emotion has already begun to evolve in these androids without programming.Example:  Why doesn't teddy go to Martin who is his programmed and rightful owner?  Does he actually PREFER David? Why does Joe continue to stay with David in Rouge (though no longer in danger of the ""flesh fair"") when as a ""lover"" he is in a climate to default to a programming priority? Why did teddy save the hair sample for so long instead of giving it to David at the soonest possible opportunity? Why are the androids (which were built by androids, mind you) so concerned with David's happiness?  Why would the happiness of a fellow android even be part of the equation?These issues are too obvious to be accidental.  David processes with a logic platform of an adult but with the imprinted emotions of an infant. (Shades of Roy Baty and Pris.)  This proves to be to his disadvantage; instead of crying from the crib which would have provoked a maternal response from Monica, he says ""I love you mommy"" constantly and spills her extinct perfume.He is treated like a pet monkey. (and where is ""Dad"" in all this, isn't he concerned about losing his job by being so irresponsible with such precious equipment?)  David's emotions are dismissed by his human companions because he is mecha, he can't possibly FEEL those emotions, really.
Then we are shown a world of Mechas where a humanitarian civilization is realized unlike any human ever could.  Their accomplishments are collective, not competitive, not warring.  They have survived our race physically, mentally and empathetically. Will the Mecha race be our survivors...our legacy...our ""Uberman""?  Do we have a responsibility to this legacy and what roll will we play in it's construction?  Will we embrace it or will we respond in fear and anger? Flesh fair, anyone? We are coming upon the times when these questions must be asked and Kubrick has begun asking them.With regard to Steven Speilberg's influence.  I suspect that he has not deviated so far from the path.  I found the film to be entirely Kubrickesque in nature and applaud Speilberg's effort to remain true to the cause. He has proved over and over again that he can step outside himself and embrace the vision of his constituents.  (example: Empire of the Sun)",A.I. Artificial Intelligence

He was the first of his kind and when a certain chain of coded words are spoken to him, whoever says them will be the object of his love.

All in all, I think this was am amazing and thoughtful film. Jude Law is a colorful character who tries to help David along the way, wonderfully playing a robot programmed in the art of pleasuring woman. The movie takes on a futuristic sort of Pinocchio, with a talking teddy bear acting as David's ""Jimminy Chrickett"" and a trip to a place called Rouge City.

To be honest there is some truth in what some people say about what is wrong with A.I. Truthfully though it boils down to what you think about the film that matters, so, what did I think of A.I? I enjoyed it for the most part, but yes this film is definitely a flawed masterpiece. A.I proves to be for 2 acts a brilliant film; Spielberg has crafted a story full of great imagery and a number of meanings. Even the third act has some moments, the Blue Fairy scene is fantastic and the film could even have gone on to the point where David is in the house and the door opens, but instead of it being the advanced android it should have been Monica, after this the film just gets strange and starts to drag a lot. Unfortunately the story has at times to many subtexts and plots and could have been simplified (again cutting the third act would have done this), the Gigolo Joe murder mysterywas not needed at all and was complete filler, joining up Joe/David could have been done much easier. The acting is simply wonderful, Jude Law gives a great performance as Gigolo Joe and Haley Joel Osmont proves The Sixth Sense wasn't a fluke, this kid can act as good as many top name adult actors, he was apparently Spielberg's one and only choice and I can see why. Teddy also gives a fine acting performance as well! The score from John Williams is perfect for the movie and the FX are nothing but breathtaking, they always compliment the story rather than dominate it. Would I suggest stopping watching the movie at the end of the second act?

I don't know what Spielberg was thinking when he made this movie.  It's like it was written as they filmed it.  The ending (don't worry I won't give it away) is the worst ending I have ever seen. Avoid this movie like the plague!  Poor Kubrick is probably doing cartwheels in his grave.,A.I. Artificial Intelligence
1078,movie_watcher,This should be viewed at least once.,8,8 July 2001,This is a good movie not a great movie.  After seeing this I wonder how much would have been different if Kubrick would have completed the project. This movie ends up being Spielberg's vision of what he believed Kubrick's vision was.  I am not a Kubrick fan and think that Spielberg left alone would have made it a better movie.  The first part of the movie is Spielberg and then it gets a little strange.  Spielberg mad the movie without compromising his own believes but trying to stay loyal to Kubrick.  A think that a lot of Kubrick's ideas show up in the middle and end of the movie.,A.I.

1079,mickiequinn,"WARNING! SPOILER!: Imaginative, Beautiful & Thoughtful",10,8 July 2001,"After two viewings of this movie, I'm convinced that A.I. ranks right up there with Spielberg's Close Encounters and E.T. Though, A.I. has that creepy Kubrick edge. It wasn't cute or happy, despite the child and teddy bear as stars. The movie really questioned human nature in various situations. The relationship between robots and humans is brilliantly explored with some interesting twists. The loophole of creating an artificial boy who will love unconditionally, but not factoring in the bad things that the pursuit of being loved will do: jealousy, obsession, self doubt, depression...The first time I saw the movie, I wasn't crazy about the ending. I thought maybe it should end underwater with no 'dream-come-true' except that the audience realizes (like with the Tinman or Data) the pursuit of being human is what makes these machines humans. I thought the scene with the aliens was slightly hokey and turned a brilliantly human movie into a fairy tale. In my second viewing, I realized that these beings were not aliens, but the robots Mecha built. That realization make the ending so beautiful.So, without a clever end to my review, I loved it.

Spielberg has brought Kubrik's story to life...The filming is amazing - the camera tells the story...Gigolo Joe (Jude Law) is truly amazing - his character is believable and sexy in a mecca sort of way... a definite candidate for best supporting actorHaley Joel Osmet needs to be treasured.  His acting ability is by far one of the best on the screen.The film deserves respect and not trashing - it should be cherished.",A.I. Artificial Intelligence
1081,RHa409,Extraordinary.,9,3 July 2001,"I loved this film. It isn't one of the greatest films ever made, but it's a personal favorite of mine. I cried at the two sad points, I laughed at the mannerisms of Gigalo Joe and Teddy, the super-toy, my heart pumped faster at the action, suspense, and horror, but overall, I really enjoyed the film on a whole. I didn't find an ounce of it boring at all. It's practically the same as observing an extraordinary life and extraordinary tale of a boy who just wants his mommy. But the boy is not a boy, and rather a robot. But the way he acts can pass for a human any day.The look of the film was dazzling and amazing. From the facilities in the underwater Manhatten, to the curvy, sensual architecture of Rouge City. I really felt as if I were really going along for a great ride and once I stepped out of the theater, I wanted more.The film is from Steven Spielberg based on Brian Aldiss' short story, ""Super-toys Last All Summer Long"" which was doctored up by Stanley Kubrick. The film is a tribute to the legendary filmaker, but it is not his film, but rather Spielberg's. Sure it sometimes tries to mimic his styles, but that's practically the same as a filmmaker paying homage to a great. It's more or less the same as somebody making his adaptation of a novel or maybe graphic novel, since Kubrick supplied some of his artwork through designs. The story is Kubrick's, but the film is Spielberg's.Although it may seem ridiculous to some at some points, it's a future, not THE future, but a rendition of it and somethings may happen in THIS future that may seem unrealistic. The film has a great score, but it just doesn't stand out like some of John Williams's other scores. The end could be considered a homage to Spielberg's ""Close Encounters Of the Third Kind"" or it could be something different, something more along the lines of the film's title, Artificial Intelligence, but only a far more advanced form of it.The acting in this film is great along with the emotions, visions, humor, and fright.

Look no more, here it is: the most ridicule camp movie of our new millennium has arrived. Everything is there: already outdated special effects, a musical score that is obviously made to cover up the total lack of fresh and creative visual settings, and the Magnum Opus of, indeed, robotlike actors -that goes for the humans as well as robots acting robots.

I intentionally avoided all marketing and propaganda about  this movie prior to going last night.  The buzz after the movie mirrored by my view and the group of six with whom I saw this movie.  It was horrible.As a preface ... I like to think and be intruiged about the possiblity of what the future has in store for us.  I like well made sci-fi, special effects, and most of all, intelligent and talented, people at work.The entire time (and it was long), I was giving Speilberg credit.  I believed that he would pull off a surprise that would bring it all together. I believed that Speilberg wanted to keep us guessing and thinking. However, it was completely disjunctive and without climax.Also, I'm not alone in fighting the urge to fall asleep.  This is not to take anything away from any actors.  They did the best with what they were given.Many effects and ideas were easily appreciated.  However, they far from outweighed the plot or dialogue.I suggest that you do not support this movie by wasting your earned dollar. Hollywood should not be encouraged to reinforce its belief that ""us Americans"" will spend our money on anything and everything that it puts out. We go see movies because of the hype.

1084,jimizee,"Interesting, creative, unique, long...",8,26 June 2001,"Let's see here... I'm not sure where to start! I suppose the first thing that I did after I saw the premiere was scratch my head and ask myself, ""did I like this?"" It's certainly is not your run-of-the-mill type of movie; it's different and creative, taking you to places most movies don't go. I'm almost certain most people will either love it, or hate it, but few people in-between. (like me) If you liked the George Lucas THX movies, 12 monkeys, original Planet of the Apes, science fiction type of movies, then you're in for a real treat. Though don't venture to this one expecting heart-pounding action at every turn, there's quite a bit of a dramatic edge that can slow the movie down rather quickly.Perhaps this is the paradox. The audience was very mixed, older people who were looking for an interesting and compelling plot, and teens/college people, looking for those fast-pace multi-million dollar computer generated graphic action sequences. When the movie combined both, I think it left a few people upset. Younger folks literally left the theater when it got too slow, and older people thought it was too crazy and unexpected when it picked up. I seriously thought it was several movies in one.If your asking me whether or not it's worth it to pay to see this in a theater, I would have to say yes, it's quite a unique experience even if you dislike it. It's one of those movies that stays in your mind for the rest of the day, leaving you pondering.A WORD OF WARNING: Toward the end of this movie, certain sequences will give you the sensation that the movie is about to end. This happens like 20 times, but keeps on going, and going, and going. In reality the movie is like 2 1/2 hours, which still is shorter than other big budget movies like Titanic and Braveheart. I think I would have SERIOUSLY enjoyed this movie more, if someone would have told me, ""wait there's more!"" Some people actually left because of the frustration of waiting for it to end. Not that the movie was necessarily bad, in actuality the end gets rather interesting. Its just that it kept going for a while. So kick back, and don't even think about getting up until you've literally seen the credits.",A.I. Artificial Intelligence

Comic relief and touching moments were easily counterbalanced by creepy scenes and undertones all during the 2.5 hour flick. I will need to see this film again to fully understand it, I suppose. Do not see this movie if you aren't ready for something extra heavy that requires a lot of thought. The Osment kid was great as usual but a big surprise for me was Jude Law, who was outstanding.

1087,cobybeck,Mad Max meets the Wizard of Oz,6,28 July 2001,"Though my anticipation of this film was high, my opinion of it definitely is not, it is a disappointing mish-mash of disparate angles and styles. While I do not hesitate to recommend seeing it for the many surprises in the plot and the excellent visual imagery of a distant future, I can not say that it had much to offer in terms of originality. In fact at times it seemed to be nothing more than a grab-bag of characters, scenes and story lines from other films all over the cinematic map, a kind of Mad Max meets the Wizard of Oz, with a few Star Trek style plot contortions thrown in for good measure.If you expected something new from the ""what does it mean to be human"" angle or a fresh take on the ""ethics of playing God"", you will not find it. It definitely addresses these questions, they are central to the whole film, but sadly it says absolutely nothing new, it has all been said so many times already.For me, these reasons keep this film well away from the great movies of all time category. It is however still worth the 7.50$ I paid for it. Lower your expectations and I'm sure you will enjoy yourself!",A.I. Artificial Intelligence
1088,zyzzyx15,A concept with potential ... all shot to pieces,2,30 June 2001,"Judging by the hundreds of other moviegoers squirming uncomfortably around me this evening during an opening-night screening of A.I., I was likely not the only one anxious for the film to just give up and quit. After numerous false endings and countless (literally) loose ends left fluttering about in the wake of the film's wrecklessly careening plot, I found myself finally letting go of what had started out as a genuine hope the the movie might go somewhere interesting. Backing up a bit... The concept is strong. The acting is superb. The non-human characters show some genuine creative thought as to what humans might one day create and also what they might one day evolve to be. But that's it. The concept falls apart in minutes. What seems to be a logical plot starts spinning wildly out of control and spawning an amazing array of completely disjointed subplots, not one of which is offered a mere five minutes of development. Stepping stones to somewhere brilliant, one hopes as the film drags on. Stepping stones to nowhere, it turns out. Well, Manhattan really. But not. Because, you know, there's small a water problem and and some issues with the space-time continuum here and there. Throughout the drudgery the viewer gets pinpricks of character development - enough to tantalize and give rise to speculation as to why certain characters make their decisions. It's almost subliminal though. Just as fast as such clues appear they're cast aside in favor of a whole new direction. There's some stylish evidence of Kubrick in the music and and the lighting. But everything else has ""Spielberg"" and ""Marketing Tool"" and ""Future Ride at Some California Theme Park"" written all over it. It's cheese. Swiss cheese. I found it hard not to leave laughing at the silliness and feeling pity for the throngs lined up for city blocks waiting for the next showing.",A.I. Artificial Intelligence

The movie seems to have been ""assembled"" rather than created.  Again, the film is like the robot, David, who is a miraculous assembly of parts that don't add up to a meaningful whole.The ""borrowing"" from other films, such as The Wizard of Oz, Bladerunner, E.T., and, of course, 2001, is distracting and comes across as schizophrenic.  Why create these forced scenes in order to advance the storyline?The bottom line is this:  there is no story here worth telling.

1099,tonycohen-42521,"Fumbled the first and second act, recovered in the third.",6,23 July 2021,"I was super excited to watch this movie as it is two of the biggest powerhouses in the film industry who worked on it together. That being said, I was pretty disappointed almost immediately. The first scene where they are discussing the plans for the child robot had me interested but lost me when he was at the house interacting with Henry and Monica. It all just looked and felt super goofy and unrealistic. I understand that a grieving mother would look for any sort of help to rid some of the pain of a lost (or frozen for this matter) child. However the transition of Monica's resentment towards David to love for him felt rushed and choppy. Even when their actual child returned home recovered fully she still for some reason had emotions towards the robot. The second act then begins and doesn't feature the family at all - the characters who we were actually feeling emotions for, only David the robot who I wanted to be destroyed in act one.Act two just felt odd to me. David wants to become a real boy so his mother will love him. I don't have much to comment on here other than that this entire part served more as fluff to the story. Just much more unimportant than the rest of the film. By the end of it, I still don't have very strong emotions regarding David's character. I do think him staring at the blue fairy (which he miraculously found) was a powerful scene. It showed his determination to get his mother to love him and that it was truly the only thing he actually cared about. So much so that he stayed there for two thousand years pleading for his wish to come true.Now in the third and final act of the movie, once you are able to look past the CGI and the weird looking alien things that go from speaking a different, alien language to speaking English, this act almost redeems its earlier faults. The final closing scene where David is able to spend the whole day with his mother is super joyous and maybe even tear jerking. The final line of the narrator who only really existed in the third act certainly left me with a nicer and sentimental taste in my mouth. However I'm not sure I can say it saved the film for me. I think Spielberg did what he could with a movie that only a masterful visionary such as Kubrick could have been done. For that, it's difficult to fault Spielberg for.",A.I. Artificial Intelligence

1102,andrewsp88,Speilburg and Kubrick,8,4 January 2007,"AI By:Andrew Paulcheck The movie AI was directed by Steven Spielberg and written by Stanley Kubrick. In the near future, the polar ice caps have melted and the oceans waters have risen to flood all costal cities. One company owner, Professor Hobby, has designed a human like boy based on the image of his dead son. His name is David. David is different from most robots because he is programmed to feel love. Monica, his mother, is the woman who adopted him as a substitute for her real son, who is in cryo-stasis because there is no cure for a disease that he has contracted. David lives happily till his brother is cured and sent home. David accidentally endangers his brothers life and is taken back to the lab were he came from for destruction. During the trip, this Monica has a change of heart. Instead of destroying her son she will abandon him in the forest. This movie is the tale of Davis quest of becoming a real boy to gain his mothers love.This movie was marvelous, interesting and suspenseful through out. I typically hate all child actors but the acting by Haley Joel Osment was great for the robot part. Frances O'Connor played a perfect role as a caring mother and Jude Law was a fantastic male prostitute. The camera work and special effects were very well accomplished. In the intense scene when David and Gigolo Joe are running from the Flesh Fair blimp I was given chills at the first sight of the rising moon like blimp. This was quickly followed by an intense chase threw the forest. The other robots in captivity have great effects on them as well. One has a head that can be seen threw and another is a old hunched back.At the Flesh Fair, David is put on display to be executed. Before acid can be poured on him he pleads for his life and people are put in an uproar because the Flesh Fair is killing a boy. He is soon set free. This part of the movie demonstrates the difference between Stanley Kubrick and Steven Spielberg. If Stanley Kubrick was directing this movie David would have fought a bloody battle out of the friar. Instead he is able to walk right out due to human compaction. While in captivity at the Flesh Fair, David becomes friends with Gigolo Joe, a male prostitute, framed for a murder and they go on a journey trying to find the Blue Fairy from Pinocchio so she can turn David into a real boy. When David arrives at the house of the Blue Fairy he is shocked to see another David robot already there. This is the point when David realizes he is not an individual but actually a machine. David is outraged and bashes the other David's head in with a lamp. This is the first violent emotional outburst of David. After he talks to Professor Hobby, the man who created David, David learns he is an individual after all. David was the first robot to ever follow his dreams. Sadly, this does not boost David's spirits. As he sits on the top of the building where he thought The Blue Fairy would be and he utters one word,""Mommy"". Then throws him self over the edge into water where he sinks down to see an amusement park that has a Pinocchio exhibit. This again is a point were Steven Spielberg has obviously changed. Had Stanley Kubrick Directed this, David would have surely killed himself from the fall off the building. After David sees the Blue Fairy at the Pinocchio exhibit he takes the helicopter under water where he asks the statue, which resembles his mother, to make him a real boy.David stays at the bottom of the ocean with the Blue Fairy for two thousand years until he is unfrozen by aliens looking for the meaning of life through humans. Some people found this odd, but I thought it was a creative twist to the movie. Eventually the aliens are able to bring back David's mother for one day because Teddy, David's teddy bear, had a lock of her hair. This ends up being the best day of David's life and he falls asleep forever. David eventually gets his wish and lays happily with his mother till the end of time. Spielberg's last happy scene of the movie that I'm sure Kubrick would not be happy about.This was one of the best movies I have seen in a long time. In AI the creativity of Spielberg and Kubrick combine together nicely. They create a happy, dark, science fiction movie that would make any fan of Spielberg or Kubrick leave the theater happy.",A.I.

1103,secombe82,Future classic...?,10,26 September 2001,"First of all, once again I think the critics have got it wrong. Like Blade Runner and 2001, this is a film that will be properly judged in 10/20 years or maybe more. Its way ahead of its time, the combination of Kubrick and Spielberg is unique, its unlikely we will ever see anything like this again.
Did I like it? The answer would have to be yes, the mix of styles will put many people off, but I found it to be unlike anything I have ever seen, and all the better for it. The story is by no means original but everything else about the film is so different that this can be forgiven. To get one thing straight, Kubrick decided Spielberg would be the better man for directing it, and I think this was a very wise decision, many of the ideas are pure Kubrick, but Spielberg has the neccassary attributes to direct such a film, and great credit has to go to Kubrick for handing it to him.Haley Joel Osment is amazing, the robot/human emotion must be amazingly difficult to pull off effectively, but Osment does it with such relative ease to the point where you do believe he is a robot, not that he is just acting as a robot. Jude Law is excellent, and so to is Frances O'Conner.
As for the ending, as brave as an idea it may of been to end on a downbeat note at ""the first ending"" I think the slightly upbeat ending is much more appropriate.All in all I would say A.I is a wonderfully unique film that should be judged for what it is, a film. Forget everything about the Spielberg/Kubrick ""issue"" and just sit back and take in a truely amazing film. You may hate it, you may love it, but no matter what, it will effect your emotions in some way and you will discuss the film afterwards.This film will be truely judged in 20 years or so, when it can be assessed purely as a film, as with 'Blade Runner', '2001', and even 'The Thing', it will get better with age.",A.I.

1108,freshman39,The Best Film of the Year,10,15 October 2001,"I had heard very little of the hype, read none of the reviews, and wanted to form an honest opinion of this movie. My expectations going in were quite high, however, as it was a Steven Spielberg movie. Every single one those expectations was met, if not exceeded.This movie had some fantastic performances. Haley Joel Osment amazed me with his performances in ""The Sixth Sense"" and ""Pay It Forward."" He tops both, though, with this performance, as David. Both Jude Law and Frances O´Connor performed beautifully, memorably contributing to the entire film. Many complain that O´Connor was not maternal enough, that she didn´t exude the motherly ""aura"" that the role required. I couldn´t disagree more. She gave the role exactly what it needed. Her´s was a beautiful performance.
Even the minor actors made the film a masterpiece. The sets were whimsical with a certain darkness about them, and the special effects were seamless. I always enjoy Mr. Spielberg´s movies, and I believe this may top the list.I am troubled when I read on this website that the movie was an unsuccessful blending of Spielberg and Kubrick. Those opinions are appreciated; I only hope that they are well-founded in extensive study of the films of both these men, the filmmaking process, and a sincere love of motion pictures. While I have seen every one of Mr. Spielberg´s movies, I´ve seen only four of Mr. Kubrick´s, and aside from that, I have not studied in-depth the filmmaking process. I therefore feel inadequate to make any judgement on the blending of the two styles. I saw similarities with the works of both directors in this film, and enjoyed seeing them. From my limited experience, I believe Mr. Spielberg did well in telling Mr. Kubrick´s story.
This is a beautiful movie in every sense of the word. It is about a child, making his way through a harsh and cruel world, trying desperately to return to the comfort of his mother´s arms. He craves love. Nothing else.Amid all the fantastic settings, imaginative characters, and thought provoking statements, I saw this movie to be a parable for the life of each and every person on earth. As children, we cherish the comforts we have, the unconditional love we receive. But we grow up. We can no longer take that love for granted. We make our respective ways through this world, trying so hard to return to he simple desires of our childhood, to love and be loved. When it absolutely boils down to it, that is all any of us wants.This movie is not for adults. It is presented from a child´s perspective, with a child´s understanding of the world. Having experienced life´s triumphs and downfalls, we, as adults, cannot look at this movie and the world it presents us with an honest heart and open mind. But when we try our hardest to see this film through the eyes of David, an innocent child, we can leave behind all that bombards us in this world, and for a brief moment, feel the simple love that, deep down, we all desire.",A.I.

He has even depressed us with ""Schindler's List,"" and again, ""Saving Private Ryan.""  He has never given us all of those emotions at once in one movie until now.  ""A.I."" was the best movie of the entire summer of 2001.  The movie was one long emotional roller coaster ride and it was well worth the seven bucks admission for the night show.

What is up with his need to have these sappy, weepy, hyper-melodramatic moments in his movies. It's getting worse and worse in recent years.  I noticed it in Schindler's List, then it got worse in Saving Private Ryan, where the shameless tear-jerking scenes of the old man nearly ruined an otherwise fine movie.  But A.I. takes the cake.First let it be said that the kid is the real deal.  A fine performance, much more impressive than in the overrated Sixth Sense.  Jude Law is very good as well.  There are moments of great beauty, great special effects, moments of genuine poignancy...then there's the ending.  I literally stared at the screen in disbelief with my mouth hanging open during the movie's closing moments.  Disbelief that Steven Spielberg could do this to what could have been a fine if flawed movie.  Stanley Kubrick must be rolling over in his grave.  Heaven forbid we have a movie that doesn't end on a sappy weepy feel-good-through-your-tears note.  With the clout that he has, and the obvious talent (that's apparent sometimes at least), you'd think maybe Steven could go for the thoughtful ending for once.  But no, reach for your hankies, you must, you have been programmed to do so by the master manipulator of melodrama.  I left the theater feeling thoroughly disgusted with Spielberg and angry as well.

I think what kills it as a financial success for Spielberg is the fact that he took such a risk with the emotions of the audience.We don't like the ugly mirror image of ourselves.  Not all the gloss that Spielberg can call upon can mask the darkness.  I found myself in shock, just trying to deal with the sheer inhumanity directed at the David character.  It makes you question what it is that makes us a race worthy of outlasting the future beings we will create.They will surpass us in all things.  We like to think that we have a corner on human compassion, but this movie will make you question what really makes us special.I really liked this movie.  It isn't perfect.  I think the human characters are 2 dimensional and flawed on purpose in order to underscore the importance of the mecha's innocence.  This is the same device used in the old monster movies.  The trick is, mecha's are supposed to have been created for the good of humanity.  Aaaah!  There are so many ways you can go with this.  To leave saying it was ""stupid"" or ""not as good as ----""  misses the whole point.  If you can't get excited about the implications of A.I., you shouldn't see the movie.

The genius of Spielberg and Kubrick combined paved the way for a classic.  People have commented on how bad of a ""Spielberg"" movie this is, but let's not forget this really isn't a Spielberg movie.  This came out of the mind of one Stanley Kubrick.  One of the greatest film makers ever.  It was luckily passed down to Mr. Spielberg.  If anybody else would have directed this film it would have been a disaster.  Haley Joel Osment and Jude Law give the performances of their careers and Frances O'Connor is stunning as well. The Score.  Perfect.  Steven Spielberg and John Williams are like peas in a pod, peanut butter and jelly when it comes to movie music.  It is no surprise that the score has been nominated for an Oscar.  It isn't a classic like Star Wars or Indiana Jones classic, but it is unique and fitting.  The Art Direction is wonderful and unique as well.

David-along with Teddy and the script-is left in the woods to fend for himself.The ensuing quest for the Blue Fairy, and silhouettes against giant ""E.T."" full moons left me wondering if David would be able to phone home. The story really started spiraling downward at the Flesh Fair. But when ""Lil' Penny"" showed up, it hit rock bottom.

It almost seems to be a reproduction of the fairy tale Pinocchio with today's standards of the future.  The teddy bear that went everywhere with David represented Jiminy Cricket.  David represented Pinocchio.  The Swintons represented the old man that created Pinocchio. And Martin played the part of all the other boys that Pinocchio wanted to be like.

1124,kashmir_17,A.I.: Artificial Intelligence,9,25 April 2002,"(This review contains spoilers)The new Steven Spielberg film and pet project of the late Stanley Kubrick based on the 1969 short story Super-Toys Last All Summer Long, has finally come out in theatres. Two master filmmakers (on two different sides of the coin) on one project. This one had to be of epic proportions.Well I was extremely impressed to say the least. A.I. Artificial Intelligence was even better than what I expected. From start to finish, I was in awe of its sheer beauty and human emotions expressed through the non-human character of David. A.I. is mainly a futuristic twist on the Pinocchio story. The story follows a small robot-boy named David (Haley Joel Osment) who has been programmed to love his family and fill in for their hospitalized child.David's mommy (Frances O'Connor), one day starts to read the story of Pinocchio to David. David becomes very intrigued with this story and builds the idea that if he finds his `Blue Fairy', he will become a real boy and his mommy will love him forever as her own. David soon becomes cut off from his family's love, due to some misunderstood and so-called attacks towards his family members. His mommy then drives out to a secluded forest to abandon David only due to his recent attacks on their family. While David is lost and homesick, he meets an outgoing robotic man whose gift is to pleasure women, named Gigolo Joe (Jude Law) who reminded me a lot of a non-psychotic Alex DeLarge from A Clockwork Orange; while David in the beginning of the film reminded me a lot of E.T. David and Joe (and a super-cool Teddy Bear named Teddy) begin an unforgettable quest to find David's `Blue Fairy' so he can come back home to live with his mommy. This film, being created by Steven Spielberg, won't have your typical apocalyptic, sinister, and twisted Kubrick finale. But since it is partially Kubrick's film, it won't have a too soft, warm, and sentimental Spielberg finale. It's in a way `cut even'. In the end David does find his `Blue Fairy' and does become a real boy; and he does get to see his mommy but only for one day after two thousand years of searching for his `Blue Fairy' and mommy. The way this ending coincides with both a Kubrick and Spielberg finale is that David does get to become a real boy (Spielberg stylized finale) but eventually he must die (Kubrick stylized finale); and he does get to spend a whole day with his mommy (Spielberg stylized finale) but once the day is done she will never wake up and the film ends on that exact note (Kubrick stylized finale). So in a way the ending is too dark to be a Spielberg ending, but too tender to be a Kubrick film. But the ending does leave you like any other Kubrick film: Thought-provoked and almost chilled. A.I. is an extraordinary film that ventures into the human soul, and what us humans would do under these difficult circumstances, even though the film is about a robot. A.I. also touches on things that all people have gone through at least once like loneliness, abandonment, and the frustrations of life. A.I. is brilliant in the way that it pays homage to Fleming's The Wizard of Oz, Lucas' Star Wars franchise and Kubrick's sci-fi classics as 2001: A Space Odyssey and A Clockwork Orange, as well as Spielberg's own E.T.: The Extra-Terrestrial, Close Encounters of the Third Kind, Empire of the Sun and even Jurassic Park. The visuals in A.I. are absolutely stunning. Industrial Light & Magic (ILM) has done it again with their `out-of-this-world' computer effects. ILM has worked on such mega-success computer-imaged films such as Jurassic Park, Terminator 2: Judgement Day, Titanic, and Who Framed Roger Rabbit. Dennis Muren's visual effects and Stan Winston's special robot makeup effects and animatronic design and effects are truly unbelievable. Haley Joel Osment (The Sixth Sense, Play it Forward) delivers another brilliant and Oscar worthy performance as the robot-boy who is programmed to love his family. In A.I., Osment does not blink once throughout the film to give his character a more inhuman trait. Osment's partner in A.I., Jude Law (The Talented Mr. Ripley, Enemy at the Gates) performed a fantastic witty portrayal as Gigolo Joe. A.I. is a captivating, spellbinding, and prophetic sci-fi fantasy that will make you laugh, cry, think, and entertain.

The main premise (already explored - and explored well - in 'Blade Runner') quickly gives way to a hokey mish-mash of the afore-mentioned Blade Runner, Mad Max, and Pinocchio that moves at a lethargic pace, and pummels the viewer repeatedly with the moralistic principles of a five-year-old through the use of 2-Dimensional, unsympathetic, and unlikeable characters.  On top of that, we are subjected to weird technological limitations.  Is it too much to ask for some science with my fiction?

The actors were right on the spot (especially Jude Law was brilliant thanks to his attractive robotic appearance and great acting skills) as Osment was suprisingly good. The only thing that I didn't like was that Spielberg little too much linked Pinochio to the plot. (maybe a spoiler) The narrative voice at the ending simplified and explained things a bit too much.

I had never seen anything like it. It was magical. The film took hold of me from the first minute and didn't let go before the film was over. Perfect. As the film was actually the director Stanley Kubrick's project, a film he had planned for 20 years, he didn't get to finish it because of his death. The film is based on a novel by Brian Aldiss from 1969 (""Supertoys Last All Summer Long""). After Kubrick's death in 1999, his wife asked Steven Spielberg if he would bring her deceased husband's vision to the screen. Spielberg had spoken several times with Kubrick about the film, and he accepted the task. The result is a mixture of Spielberg and Kubrick, two of the greatest geniuses in film. The film is a mixture of the sentimental Spielberg, a commercial, family film and Kubrick's detailed, thought-provoking and visually stunning talents. It is the mixture of heart and brain. A perfect film. Haley Joel Osment, who proves he is one of the best child actors ever in this film, plays David; he is actually a robot, but he looks like, behaves like, feels like and shares love like a human being. The son of Henry and Monica is in a coma, and they decide to take in David as a kind of substitute for their own son. Monica establishes a maternal love for David, and decides to ""activate"" him, so he gets the same love for her. But as he has been activated, he can't ever be deactivated. This becomes a problem because Monica and Henry's own son wakes up from coma and comes back. . . The film is full of wonderful scenes, such as when Monica wants to get rid of David, and he finds himself left in the cold, outside world. Now when David is not familiar with anyone, he has no one to give his unconditional love to, the movie really blossoms. ""A.I."" is filled with amazing special effects and many visual moments as David tries to find out who he really is. The film ends in a great, beautiful and heart wrenching way. I sat there after the end, with the underlying questions: What makes us real? Is it the ability to love and to be loved that makes us human?

1135,yalic99,A true masters ultimate piece of work,10,9 June 2006,"One of the greatest love stories ever told in a package that is one of the best movies ever produced. The story of a defenceless creature (albeit a robot) cast away by the only person he loves yet is unable to feel anything else except that all-encompassing love. Spielberg takes us on a subtle roller coaster ride of emotions through a masters palette of styles. One of the darker sides of humanity is shown when a caring mother will abandon her adopted child for reasons she does not fully understand herself. Yet woven through the story of desertion, disappointment, betrayal, and terror is an overwhelming sense of love and courage. All of it through the innocent eyes of a totally subservient child-being.

1136,robertcolin72,Fantasy or Reality?,6,31 December 2004,"Being quite a fan of fantasy fiction I was really looking forward to seeing Spielberg's take on the original story based upon the fear of advanced artificial intelligence in the robots of the future.The plot primarily concerns David (Haley Joel Osment). A landmark in robotics, he looks like any other boy and believes he is only because he has been programmed to think so. David is took in by the Swinton family when there son becomes ill in an attempt to keep Monica Swinton sane. Evidently things get complicated, very complicated.The story began for me with a possible futuristic theme with the obvious degree of scare mongery that comes with this genre and this theory holds until Jude Law's character (Gigolo Joe) is introduced. Queue fantastically created and animated cities which when seen couldn't help but be impressive.A short (and as always funny) cameo from Robin Williams later and the story goes completely off the rails. I won't mention any specifics but any sense of reality goes flying out of the window but the end is not without its emotion.Osment is a star as the robot boy David, I wonder what odds the bookmakers would give me on him winning an Oscar by the age of 21?",A.I.

1137,jacobtaylor2000-883-783374,AI: worth a watch? The answer is yes!,9,24 August 2014,"AI is an interesting, yet puzzling film to watch and review. Many are aware of the story surrounding the two directors involved, Stanley Kubrick and Steven Spielberg. They both wanted the other one to direct, but Kubrick passed away, so Spielberg took up the reins as director, and came out with a visually stunning film, that can come up short at times.WHY YOU SHOULD WATCH IT: As said above, incredible visuals and effects. A great cast (Meryl Streep, Jude Law, Brendan Gleeson and Robin Williams to name a few) that seem 100% devoted to this project. Haley Joel Osment gives a surprisingly believable performance. There are also some genuinely sad and disturbing scenes, made all the more sad and disturbing with a brilliant score. And it has an interesting premise, and while it is not looked into too deeply, it still makes you think.IT'S FLAWS: A conflicted director. With Spielberg, the crowd-pleasing film maker, doing a artsy and thoughtful Kubrick film, he seems like he's not quite sure which direction to go in for this film. Consequently, the feel of this movie moves so quickly between dark and disturbing to happy and whimsical, that it sometimes throws you off. certain characters get some anticlimactic and unceremonious goodbyes, and at some points the story lacks sense. The climax, that was written by Kubrick himself, tries so hard to make a happy ending out of the depressing story of the movie, it doesn't fit in.BUT SHOULD YOU WATCH IT? Yes! Even if you only watch it once, at least you can say that you did. It's not ""best film"" worthy, but there are so many talented people working on this project, that in the end, you can always find something to enjoy. Be it Jude Law's eccentric performance, the unique visual style, or John William's score. Love it or hate it, it's been hailed as a classic.WHO SHOULD WATCH IT? Unless your kid is made of strong stuff, I would recommend not letting a kid under the age of 10 watching this (9 would be pushing it). It contains some mature stuff kids may not understand.I hope this review was helpful to you, if it was, I shall do more of these reviews on various other movies.",A.I. Artificial Intelligence
1138,mlentricchia,The idiot auteur dumps yet another turd in an overflowing toilet,2,3 October 2005,"From the start the film's concept is hard to swallow (A robot child that never grows up? What's the point? At what point do you get rid of it and get an older one?) and nothing that happens over the course of the film makes it any more feasible. The plot draws out with painful predictability: a few scenes of the mother bonding with her robot ""son"", then her real-life son coming out of the coma he began the movie in. Conflicts between the human and robot child result, which eventually prompt the mother to release the robot into the woods (with much melodrama and the typical Spielberg tear-jerking tactics) so he won't be deactivated as a threat to her real son. Next we get an annoyingly forced and obvious Holocaust metaphor. One robot even drags out the ""history repeats itself"" adage, so utterly threadbare and rendered absolutely meaningless by this point. Pointless and unfunny slapstick abounds, mostly in the form of Jude Law playing a foppish prancing gigolo robot. If your intelligence is not insulted at any point in this movie, then the insult is richly deserved. Robin Williams and Chris Rock get enlisted as bit voice-actors, solely to draw the viewers out of the story, I would assume--certainly there is no other reason to put famous actors in such roles. Meanwhile John Williams phones in yet another generic and forgettable score.Finally the movie plods far enough along for Spielberg to drop the Big Shocker on us: the robot child is only one of many identical ones that are being mass-produced from the public. The droid freaks out, and as final damning evidence of how emotionally unstable and potentially dangerous he is, he destroys one of the other robots. The robot company decides to release thousands more of the model anyway. I guess lawsuits are a thing of the past in the this brave new world. Just in case you managed to take some of what proceeded in the movie seriously, the final act seems designed to destroy any plausibility it had. I won't spoil it for you. However, it's so poorly-written and incongruous with the rest of the film that I'd be remiss to not mention it. It reminds me of creative writing assignments I used to get in middle school, where the teacher would ask me to write another chapter to the end of an assigned book and I'd come up with something like ""Chapter 27: Holden Caulfield Solves A Murder Mystery.""Utter crap with a veneer of phony sophistication.",A.I.

1140,galt007,Philosophical problems in the treatment of the concept of love,7,12 January 2017,"There is a philosophical contradiction inherent in the core idea of this story. The story opens with a demonstration of a Mecha woman (a ""robot"") who is not capable of romantic love. Then, the scientist declares that in order to bridge the gap between a Mecha and a human, he will create a Mecha child that could love his parent. But that kind of love is not romantic love, and immediately the scientist (and the script writer of this movie) is guilty of the fallacy of equivocation.Let's jump over this equivocation, however, and continue to discuss the love of a child to a parent. What is the nature of it? We can be sure that it's under a debate between two extremes of: (a) it is a biological link, or (b) it is a matter of choice, like romantic love. In both cases, however, the new Mecha child who can be imprinted to love anyone indiscriminately, does not address the issue. Imprinting the child to love a certain parent would be compatible with the biological theory, but then the association is purely deterministic and does not unlock the secret of humanity, so cogently represented by Man's distinctive ability for romantic love.For the second possibility, note that loving requires free will and making choices. This fact is reflected in the adage of ""can't buy love"". This love is not something that can be imprinted -- a programmed ""love"" looses its value and is a contradiction. Furthermore, a human child would need a long time to develop such love, through experience and contemplation. He must form necessary prerequisite concepts in order to form the advanced concept love. In human children, such process may take the full childhood period, concluding only at maturity. Adults recognize the same principle about romantic love when they caution teenagers, who declare to have fallen in love (which is an infatuation, in fact), to expect several long relationships before finding true love.A corollary point is that, opposed to the thesis of the story, the Mecha child is inferior to all the other Mechas. That is because the behaviour of all the other Mechas appear to be volitional. They decide and act by a free will, which can be observed in the behaviour of the toy bear, the gigolo, and the scavengers. Unlike the Mecha child, who was imprinted to ""love"" and who seeks a fairy with a devotion of a brainwashed, these Mechas are free and act rationally to improve their lives.Ironically, Mechas with free will should be capable of rationality, and consequently of romantic love as they are, without any enhancements. Ayn Rand stated that ""love, friendship, respect, admiration are the emotional response of one man to the virtues of another, the spiritual payment given in exchange for the personal, selfish pleasure which one man derives from the virtues of another man's character,"" and that an emotion ""is an automatic response, an automatic effect of man's value premises. An effect, not a cause."" In turn, values are acquired through rational process (therefore, through choices), which she explains like this: ""Man has no choice about his capacity to feel that something is good for him or evil, but what he will consider good or evil, what will give him joy or pain, what he will love or hate, desire or fear, depends on his standard of value. If he chooses irrational values, he switches his emotional mechanism from the role of his guardian to the role of his destroyer.""(For references on those quotes, see Ayn Rand Lexicon for terms ""love"" and ""emotion"".)In conclusion, no matter how you look at it, the reasons of why this movie is supposed to be ""deep"" disappear if you consider the merits of the philosophical foundation of its plot.",A.I.

1144,Rookie676,"Good construction, good idea, bad execution.",3,19 October 2015,"Steven Spielberg and Stanley Kubrick's collaboration has produced nothing short of a fantastic failure. While both directors work marvelously well on their own, in, ""A.I."" the two have fabricated a film that, when considering all aspects of its content, understandably has extremely mixed reviews. The story of the movie and the goal of the protagonist have sudden changes, never staying consistent. There are arguably three chunks to the movie, and each one feels like it could belong to an entirely separate movie. In the beginning, the location is in a family-type house, where the protagonist, David, is introduced. David, being a realistic robot boy, is faced with challenges he is not ready to face. Then, the story is changed from his troubles in being accepted into the family, to coping with being abandoned by the person he loves most, Monica, and trying to get back to her in a dangerous world. After a long sequence of futile cat-and-mouse chasing events, David ends up thousands of years in the future, where he finally concludes his journey by meeting a clone of Monica, provided by the extremely odd alien-robots there.The casting was well-done. While some characters, such as Gigolo Joe, were rather unnecessary, the actors did a fantastic performance. Haley Joel Osment, who played David, successfully played out being a robot, slowly evolving to appear more and more human-like. Some characters could have been fleshed out a bit more, including how the actors played them, such as Henry, played by Sam Robards. The visual effects were stunning, and almost made up for the complex and crumpled plot. The mixed use of practical and visual effects brought out the best in the art direction, making it feel as if there were no effects at all. The robots with parts missing, or the entire city of Manhattan underwater, all of it mixed together and felt incredibly real. The effects became somewhat out of hand once the last third of the movie was reached, as there was a bit too heavy of a ""futuristic"" feel, especially with the ridiculous looking alien- robots.While there are many stunning parts to ""A..I"" there is no denying that it had more than its fair share of failure moments. There was the cliché of assumptions and no questions being asked when Henry continually wreaked havoc on David's reputation. There was also the classless continuation of mature jokes from Gigolo Joe, which half his lines seemed to consist of. Not to forget the sheer ridiculousness of the immense jump to the future, which included the far-fetched creatures that dwelled there.

It just *looks* like there's a heart ticking in it; it just *looks* like it's smiling; it just *acts* like it loves you; it just *looks* like it's thinking... You think I'm referring to one of the movie's creations? I'm not - I'm refering to the movie. There's hardly a character with depth; they only serve the plotline. There's a gigolo character in it who personifies the movie entirely: such a slick performer, he looks too good to be true, he acts the part perfectly... but we (or the customer) forgives him because he's obviously not pretending to be anything other than a simulacrum. It's harder for me to forgive Spielberg this movie, because he's pretending to be Kubrick. He's a pretender to the throne.I thought it was too slick. Like an old grade-B movie done up by a 21st century ad exec. Characters speak in *speeches*. They have as much depth as puppets - in other words, as much depth as you, the audience, willingly gives them. (I read somewhere a director commenting about how easy it was to shoot animal & baby movies, because all you had to do was sandwich the subject's appealing face-shot in an emotional setting and the context would trick the audience into believing the subject had the same emotion.) Be forewarned: holes abound in the story. Even the warped internal logic of the thing. And the science was comic book. It's like watching a sloppy, clumsy robot imitating life... I got embarrassed for it. Metaphorically (keeping the marionette image going here), I couldn't hear the dialogue over the movie's whirring gears. I couldn't miss the clicking relays, the snapping eye movements, the jerky plot fillers trying to smooth over holes... blatant attempts to pull a viewers own heart-strings.Over-the-top? Yes. Missing the mark? Yes, maybe because of the former. It's not a movie for kids, but it's too much a mish-mash for adults.

I went in with an open mind and good outlook on what I was about to see  I was let down.  What I ended up seeing was a rather poor film which fell flat on all levels, in my opinion.  I was very much intrigued by the ideas and characters presented in A.I.  Having read the short story upon which the film is based, I thought it was a very interesting concept derived from such a simple basis.  The question of the essence and veracity of love. The statement on human nature and the existence of emotion outside of the mind.  The idea of the journey of self discovery of a robot, experiencing human emotions outside of humanity.  All of this was very intriguing and, in me, sparked much thought.  But why did I not like this movie?  Because it was told completely wrong.  Although I was being pleasantly surprised by many of the discoveries and people found on David's journey, I kept feeling led astray from the real truth of the story.  And the end part of the film was appalling.  There too many abrupt changes and the obvious, gratuitous images and ""explanations"" found throughout the ending segments really destroyed the essence of the film.  But what really bothered me was the final steps in the plot itself.  I do not want to reveal anything, but the conclusion of the film left me feeling neither happy nor upset, and that the end of David's journey was a disgustingly contrived finish-line to a story which I realized never really took me anywhere or led me to an affective conclusion.  I realized that Mr. Spielberg had spelled-out the simple themes of this film, and stamped everything with over-obvious images and reduced the script to a almost juvenile sci-fi story.  All of the essence and theme was lost in the terrible presentation.  Why didn't this work?  Why did a Spielberg-made Kubrick-film fall flat on all emotional, visceral, and philosophical levels?  Because all of Spielberg's best films were impressive because of images.  Even his most acclaimed work Schindler's List was powerful in what it showed, not through a sub-surface theme.  Kubrick's films were successes in that there was always, at the least, an underlying tone or voice to what was being shown.  Kubrick kept the story telling simplistic and ambiguous so that the viewer could retrieve a message from what he or she was seeing.  While Spielberg would present something which could not be questioned or interpreted but merely witnessed.  Now, Spielberg is an amazing director and effective storyteller to be sure, but transferring a story with underlying Kubrick themes into a very aesthetic Spielberg movie does not work.  A.I. is not a terrible film.  It has a lot of imagination and fascination to it, but it's story was reduced to a science fiction pornography by the film's conclusion.  Overall, I was disappointed.",A.I. Artificial Intelligence
1162,dave-645,Artificial Entertainment,5,20 July 2001,"Hollywood allows for strange bedfellows. What an odd pairing: Speilberg and Kubrick. The result: a jumbled split-personality of a movie. You're never quite sure if the movie is supposed to be a tragic, unsettling look into the future, or a sci-fi fairy tale. It can't decide what it wants to be either. The movie begs for your affection as much as mecha David begs for that of his ""mother"". Finally, the ending is the most contrived, ridiculous, and strung-out summation I've ever seen. It's a farce as it touts itself as Kubrick-Speilberg creation but it's too cuddly for Kubrick and too dark for Speilberg. Again, it's like its lead character, David: it never quite understands what it's supposed to be.",A.I. Artificial Intelligence

The ending was so incredibly bad that you find yourself sitting there asking if the directors/producers watched the final cut before they released this garbage. At all costs, stay away from this film. Haley Osment and Jude Law do a great job, but the utter lack of any substance in the plot wastes their performances.

Not that you can compare it to truly bad movies like ""dude, where's my car"", but it wasn't supposed to be bad, it was a huge-budget Speilberg flick.  This made it all the more disappointing. Numerous gaping plot holes leave the story as just boring, non-engaging filler.  Much of the movie simply did not make sense when you consider the characters supposed motivation.

1167,Jakeymate,Masterpiece or a B movie gone wrong?,9,5 October 2001,"**Contains some minor and one major spoiler**After I first watched Pulp Fiction (before all the hype) I left the cinema unsure if I'd just seen a masterpiece or a seriously bad B film. The second time I saw it I knew it was a classic piece of work. The same applied to 2001 although I needed three screenings to really see the underlying genius of what appeared at first to be a very simple A to B to C movie.Maybe a truly great film does this as A.I. had the same effect on me. If a film pushes the boundaries and is sufficiently different then the first viewing can to many be an unsettling, even boring experience. In many ways, like 2001, the events on screen are only half the story allowing you time to think and reflect on themes and issues that are being raised. Am I hardwired to love my mother until I die? How will I deal with the loss of my mother? Am I any different to David in the way I would react? What extra programming do I have that would allow me to deal with such an event?Not simply because of the Kubrick connection I see A.I. as a companion to 2001. It explores who we are through the eyes and emotions of a machine, reflecting back to us a disturbing image that on further analysis is not as far from who we are as we would like to think.**Major Spoiler**I can remember thinking the ending of 2001 was a real sharp turn but realised on repeated viewings that the starchild was the only ending that could exist given the rest of the movie. It wasn't about aliens or the monolith. It was about where we came from and where we are going. Similarly A.I. has an ending that at first seems very leftfield but really is the only way it can go. Quite simply we are fundamentally unable to judge ourselves and given that we judge a fallen civilisation by its greatest creations it is our destiny to be judged in this way as well.**Major Spoiler End**Whether or not A.I. will be seen as a classic is something that is and will be debated but, in my view, it certainly has the elements. A handful of unforgettable 'to die for' scenes and images for starters.David's first, blurred appearance in the lift. David looking through the empty eyes of a half finished face. David stood with Teddy as he asks if 50 years is a long time. The nanny about to be destroyed telling David that it is going to alright.It has scenes that offer, thanks to the phenomenal talents of Haley Joel Osment and the hopefully soon to be more popular Frances O'Connor, rarely seen emotional impact. When David's face changes after he is activated. When David is first parted from his mother. When David exhibits violence that even causes Joe to retreat despite the fact that Joe has seen some of the worst things that man can do. The 'classic' scenes are almost countless.Also despite the deadly serious nature of the subject there is also abundant humour, some conventional, some very dark. The rivalry of David and Martin is both comedy and tragedy as they fight over Teddy whilst Jude Law's Gigolo Joe reminds us of the many 'uses' of technology. I once read that no technology is more quickly accepted than when pornography is a major use for it (16mm, videotape, satellite TV, DVD and the Internet). I'm not sure how true this is but Joe was a very funny example of how the base desires of humans can be satisfied through our ingenuity.On top of all this the film tackles a subject that whilst obvious and part of all our lives has never been fully explored with anything like the detail and care that it has here and if nothing else it deserves great praise for this alone.After all my ramblings though I do believe that the other reviews here point to A.I. being a masterpiece. People do seem to love or hate the film and great art should create emotion, discussion and debate, be it positive or negative. Love and hate are inseparable.Quite simply A.I. is a film that is really about something and should be seen for this alone. You may hate it with a passion but you might just love it with a passion as well and love is always worth the risk.I just hope it made enough money so that someone else will get the budget to make such an interesting movie and that Steven Spielberg feels that making a movie like A.I. is reward enough if it fails to ignite the Oscars as its failed to ignite the box office.",A.I.

It's a fairy tale about a robot child who wants to be a real boy, but like all good fairy stories, deeper issues lie just below the surface. (Pay close attention to what Gigolo Joe says in the Rouge City sequence.) Fine performances, effects, and production design make this one of the most memorable and thought-provoking big budget movies in ages. Unfortunately, wooden dialogue and a poorly executed last act keep it from reaching its full potential. Still, it's a worthy addition to works of Spielberg and, yes, Kubrick.

I liked the characters and the quiet, understated way in which the story was begun.I enjoyed David and Joe's journey.  When David finally made it to the Professor's domain and saw all the horrific copies of himself, I thought, wow, this is great.But they (the filmmakers, that is) blew it.  In my perfect world, A.I. would have ended when David jumped into the ocean.  Maybe he could have seen the Blue Fairy statue and then short-circuited and died with a smile on his face.  Or maybe Spielberg could have ended it even earlier and faded out as soon as David hit the water.But unfortunately, it doesn't happen that way.  What is all this nonsense about David being submerged for 2000 years?  He freezes for all that time, and then these crazy computer beings (like something out of the X-Files) rescue him, and oh-look, the Blue Fairy'll bring your dead mommy back, but due to some Time-Space-Universe rule (or a really cheesy plot device) she'll only last for One Very Special Day and then be gone forever.I like Spielberg's movies, but he always seems to tack on a storybook ending no matter what the content of the film.  Sometimes this works, and sometimes not.  I don't mind the sappy happy endings if they fit the film.  But this one didn't fit.  It was downright jarring.  Chop off the last 20 minutes of the movie, and A.I. is very good.  But the ending....Scrap me.  It's too painful to watch.",A.I. Artificial Intelligence

The only other Hollywood movies to do this to me were Hitchcock's Vertigo, Gilliam's 12 Monkeys and Kubrick's 2001. The way this film seems to have split people completely down the middle is reminiscent of the way people reacted to 2001 when it came out. Who can forget the story of Rock Hudson storming out at the premier because he didn't ""get it"". I was really impressed with Spielberg here, he seemed to really restrain himself, and didn't spoon-feed us in his usual style.SPOILERSWell for the most part anyway. That scene in the somewhat flawed ending where the futuristic beings explain all that wonky physics to David, didn't sit too well with me. However I strongly disagree that the film should have ended at the Ferris wheel/Blue Fairy scene. That would have been a total cop out. The ending, despite it's flaws, was powerful and deeply satisfying.END OF SPOILERSI loved all the references to other movies too. And Teddy was brilliant.

After two viewings, I finally think I got it, and I disagree with every review I have read, except that it is a must-see. As David searches for his dream, he learns more than he realizes, but the realities of other Mechas, particularly Teddy and Gigolo Joe, are not emphasized, which seems to stem from a definite respect for the viewer's intelligence. Perhaps the film would be as well named, ""Viewer Intelligence."" Joe's last four words indicate a grasp of sentience far beyond his programming, but so do his words throughout, especially in Samantha's room. Jude Law's performance is of Oscar caliber, and this is heightened by the fact that he is playing a Mecha with limited understanding. Other thoughts were the hollowness of religion when it is objectified, as opposed to when it is subjective (The Blue Fairy). One may well ponder whether David wanted individuality or reality. At one point, he wants to be like all the other boys, but then he wants to be unique. One wonders whether he lends reality to Monica, or gains it from her. What gives us meaning? Is it something we grasp, or something which grasps us, as in community or relationships with others? Most heartbreaking scene: fate of the nanny Mecha. Most symbolic elements: 2000 years, sharing of drink and cake, and the single candle left burning - a Unity Candle? Most fascinating issue, apart from those mentioned above: just how old and stupid is Teddy? He seems to have a greater grasp of meaning than a simple toy. What happens to him in the end, after David's quest is over? Does he continue to function, and do the Supermechas have more to gain from him? Finally, are the Supermechas the next step in our evolution? Spielberg has hit a touchdown in this film, and could not have made a better or more lasting tribute to Kubrick and his genius.

This is yet another attempt to examine human behavior and bias it so that the only one with redeemable qualities is the poor misunderstood object of their evil, and sometimes misguided good intentions.If you checked your brain at the door, you probably got sucked into the vacuum Kubrick created to make you feel depressed for poor little David (Haley Joel Osment), which who couldn't love this kid, but remember this HE IS A ROBOT.  Once the Martins ""real"" kid came back we see what a manipulative lovingless monster kids are, even his friends at the party were reprobates.  Nice touch.  Without giving too much away wouldn't David's self preservation be trumped with human preservation at the party scene.  If not those robot makers sure have a design flaw.  I wouldn't want to go to war with one of these robots, he would probably throw me on a grenade to save himself.  Too bad the Martins didn't know someone at the company so they could get this fixed LIKE THE ""FATHER"" of the robot.Basically this movie was meant to suck you into a depressed mode, and try to show the robots view of ""life and love."" Afterwards it would make you think you were having some sort of deep deep discussion about what are real emotions.  The problem with the movie was the people were too dark and disturbed, and the robots were made to be too victimized and were the only one's capable of genuine human emotions.  I'd hate to think what this movie would have been like if Kubrick would have gotten to finish it.  One review in here said that he wisely handed it over to Spielberg.  That wasn't the case, he had been trying to make this thing for years, but no one would go along with it.  Once Kubrick passed on his family pleaded with Spielberg to finish it.  Spielberg actually lightened it up to get it to its released state.Its too bad some great things will get sucked down the drain in this movie. The effects were spectacular.

1183,HomeTech,A very good attempt at the essence of humanity....,10,1 July 2001,"Having always been an avid movie enthusiast, I've seen just about every type of story line imaginable rehashed in ways to boggle the mind.So I am very happy to announce that this isn't one of them, nor is it a film whose intellect rides in the pages of a pulp fiction novel you'd find at your local bookstore. It is in fact a movie very much about what the title may seem, about technologies coming right at us like a freight train. It is a movie about how we would, as human beings, feel and deal with such, and then it becomes a movie of much, much more.I've not left a movie that had me as thoughtful as this one since Contact was released in 97 with Jodie Foster. That movie had a pronounced affect on the audience each and every time I saw it of both appreciation and quiet meditation.Perhaps most importantly, already a great fan of Steven Spielberg, my respect for him has risen significantly in the fact he still gave Stanley Kubrick, the man who brought the idea to Steve in the first place, full credit for the project.And you definitely feel Stanley here. I am glad that this was his ""last"" movie, instead of Eyes Wide Shut, which is rapidly becoming a classic just due to the fact that Stanley made it. No, A.I. is the film which best brings to the table probably more than any of (except 2001) his others the wonder that Stanley had about humanity itself.Steven does a wonderful job of directing to an extent I've not had the pleasure of seeing since E.T. and Close Encounters. Always a master of garnering ones emotions, his hand is not slight here.The movie is over two and a half hours long, but well worth it for the development of characters and ideas, and gives us a totally believable and realistic glimpse of the future in all its awesome possibilities.The acting of the young boy was, as is becoming expected, excellent.

One that will likely never have a promotional tie-in with McDonalds or an amusement park ride (Although Gigolo Joe would bring a new dimension to the Happy Meal.)

1188,dclxvihell,A classic case of tall poppy syndrome.....,8,25 September 2001,"Stanley Kubrick was a genius film-maker and a man of very nice judgement. It is because of his amazing ability to judge what is needed and what isn't needed in a film that he is (even in death) one of the most revered directors of all time.I'd like to say that Stanley's judgement of Steven being the most capable director to bring A.I. to the screen (apart from himself of course) what right on the money. Although I admit that Steven has made a lot of crap over the years (i.e. The Lost World), no-one can deny that the man has talent. This film is a demonstration of his talent and ability. It is with absolute resolve that I say (this is just personal opinion here) that Steven did an excellent job with the task that Stanley asked him to perform in the event that for some reason he could not bring A.I. to the screen himself.People say that the film wasn't menacing enough. That couldn't be further from the truth. The sheer humanity of the film, how human the mechans really were despite the fact that they were machienes, and how cruelly organic humans regarded them was sinster enough in itself. The gift of A.I. (as the type of A.I. represented in this film) was selfishly used and abused by humanity who were too blind to see that they were not just simple machienes. Rather that the machienes themselves, like humans (although comical in their attempts or their programming to mimic human behaviour or fulfil a specified task), had their own feelings and thoughts and could be considered 'human' by virtue of this basic human trait. The film was sinister in it's exposition of the ignorance and cruelty of human nature. The inherent abuse and disregard that mechans experience at the hands of humans was more than adequate in adding a sinster edge to the film.The acting in this film was nothing short of sensational. I cannot heap enough praise upon Haley Joel Osmont for his show stopping performance as David. If he keeps this standard going (lets hope he will) he'll end up right up there with respected actors like Edward Norton and Robert De Niro. Eventhough he is still a child, he is a first class actor which is very rare considering what the public regard as talented in Hollywood these days. Haley is half their age and has more talent in his earlobe compared to some of the actors/actresses in Hollywood today. Jude Law was excellent and Giggolo Joe and the special effects....... man Im going to be here all day at this rate.Anyway.... to get to the point. The people who said that this film was bad were probably hardcore Kubrick fans (not that I'm any exception, I absolutely adore Kubrick's work). But it should be acknowledged that there was no way that Steven could have emulated what Kubrick had in mind for this film, he was right in adding his own spin on things (hell Stan himself is guilty of doing the same thing i.e. Clockwork Orange). But the criteria upon which a film should be judged is not simply the tiny little details, but the big picture. It should be a question as to whether or not the work can stand on its own, whether or not it has substance, whether or not it is good cinema or bad cinema. You can be a Kubrick devotee, but that being said you can't simply stick your nose in the air and be blind to the great things that this beautiful film has to offer. As a cardinal rule of lovers of the film meduim, credit must be given where credit is due.As it is well known, it is very fashionable these days to bag out Steven Speilberg. And most Kubrick fans could barely stand the idea of Steven taking on Stanley's unfinished project, thinking that he might ruin everything (I should know I was one of them). There are also those who would bag Steven for other reasons such as being too commercial, being incompetent as well as choosing crappy films to direct to draw the masses (I'll admit to believeing some of this too, but I never doubted the man was talented). But all of this preconcieved baggage was heaped upon A.I., the fact that Steven is a tall poppy and people these days just look for an excuse to bag him out, hindered the ability of many people to see film for what it really was as opposed to it being simply another Steven Speilberg production.I'll grant leaverage to people who admitted the film was good but decided that it wasn't their thing because of personal taste and personal taste alone.But Stanley would be smiling from wherever he is because I'm sure that he would be quite happy with the way Steven's work turned out. It was a wonderful film and I don't care what people say, it needed a happy ending because David deserved one damnit!!! This work can stand on it's own despite the bad reviews it got, and in terms of people thinking that Stan would have made it more sinister all I've got to say is that Stan never made the same film twice, so there is no way you could ever really know for sure what he would have done provided he was alive to do it himself. If you have any doubts just think of Eyes Wide Shut (which is a great film by the way) and don't forget the wonderful reviews that it got.Despite the baggage and the bad reviews because of it, do not be fooled! The critics don't always get it right. A.I., if anything (provided it is watched with an open mind) is proof of that.",A.I. Artificial Intelligence

He makes more money doing it.  Appropriately, this same kind of sell-out mentality is reflected in A.I., where perhaps the only successful continuity is seen through his constant jabs at American corporatism.I can't fault the acting or the production for the movie's shortcomings. Nor can I say that the cinematography and special effects were anything short of first-rate.  The script, however, seems to drag on and on...and on, and on, and on, and on.  By the (trite and eye-rolling-inducing) end, I was fidgety in my seat, bored, and ready to leave.I don't mind sappiness in a movie, but when it's melodramatic twattle, it gets old pretty fast.One thumb down is what I give A.I.

This movie leaves you asking and trying to answer for yourself what it is that we all long for.

However, the quality of his work is rivaled by that of Jude Law, of whom I am a long standing fan.  In this futuristic world of robots and ""flesh fair"" only the strong survive.

1194,nplante,What might have been a wonderful package..,7,1 July 2001,"If the late great Stanley Kubrick had lived to see the fulfillment of this project it would most certainly have been an incredible movie, an easy 10/10. As it is, Spielburg does a decent job at points in trying to capture Kubrick's style, pulling off the unnerving, emotionally charged ""Kubrick effect"" quite well in certain scenes. Oh yes, I have complaints.. but the praise first.. :-)One particularly well-done scene that seems close to the way in which I would have imagined Kubrick directing it is the scene in which David destroys his duplicate mecha towards the end of the film. The mixed emotions that this piece generated reminds me of some of Kubrick's best works (certain scenes in ACO, FMG, 2001). Unfortunately, the majority of the movie does not do this, and Kubrick's stunning and often lengthy visuals are missing from the majority of it. Spielburg is certainly a great director in his own right, but Kubrick was an artist. I firmly believe that you can freeze-frame almost any given instant from any Kubrick film and find a pure piece of art. This is most certainly not true of AI. But that's all well and good, close to what I expected.There were great parts: the competition between the ""brothers"", the mother's desertion of the child, the flesh fair, the wooden dialogs with joe, the afore-mentioned destruction of the dupe, and definately the underwater patronage to the blue fairy. And then.. then it all went horribly wrong.
I completely agree with the numerous other reviewers that the last 30 minutes of this movie never should have seen the light of day. I've been trying to convince myself since I saw the movie that the epilogue never really happened, that the movie ended underwater with David repeatedly whispering the same words over and over to the blue fairy. This is what Kubrick would have done. But not Spielburg.. ugh...I won't even take the time to go into everything that was wrong with the Disney-fied ending tacked on by the director. Instead, I'll just hope that the DVD version will feature a shorter ""original intent"" cut of the film that completely leaves this mess out of it. Ugh, what crap. I'll leave you with one thought: isn't it somehow ironic that Spielburg decided to nail on this sappy everyone-get-happy epilogue when it was Kubrick's own decision when making A Clockwork Orange to leave off that sappy ending that Burgess's publishers originally demanded before publication? This flies in the face of everything that made Kubrick's movies great and perfectly demonstrates why the director of the film will never be of the same calibre. It seems that Spielburg has done an injustice not just to us as viewers, but to the memory and eternal spirit of a great artist.",A.I. Artificial Intelligence
1195,capsize,AI - PU (spoilers),5,20 July 2001,"Okay, first off, as a fairy tale and a retelling of Pinocchio the film was very good. Haley Joel Osment has locked up the Oscar and Jude Law was also very good. However, this movie just had so much bad science that I just cannot recommend it.Normally I don't have too much of a problem with bad science, but since this movie takes place on Earth I have to look at it more scrutinizingly. It takes place in our future and references real things in the past, such as the tale of Pinocchio. If it had been some far off planet I would have had less problems with it, but these are the problems I see:1. Haley Joel Osment (HJO) eats some food and ""breaks"". Um, if this is a problem wouldn't he be either built so food couldn't get into his system OR so that he was programmed so he could not voluntarily injest food?2. After eating they get him fixed. The mother is holding his hand, very emotional scene, blah, blah. Why are they fixing him? As shown earlier with a female robot, he probably has a CPU in his head or other part of his body that can easily be removed. Pull it out and slap it in a new body, fixed in half a minute.3. A boy makes HJO think he's going to cut him, to see if he has damage avoidance programmed in him. HJO gets scared and clings behind the real son (Martin) and backs into the pool. Wouldn't this be potentially harmfull? If he has damage avoidance he wouldn't fall in the pool, he's a robot, he'd have a perfect map of his surroundings in his head so he'd know where the pool is. Also, in all likelyhood, future robots will have some sort of Asimovian laws programmed into them - cannot harm a human, or let a human be harmed, etc. - so even if the pool wouldn't be a danger to HJO, his programming would prevent him from falling into the pool and endangering Martin.4. If the parents were worried about the possibity of HJO being dangerous all they would have to do is check his memory. He's a walking computer, just hook him up to a monitor and they'd see he didn't mean to hurt Martin in the pool and that Martin made him go into the parent's room with the scissors.5. The dump with all the robots scrounging for parts. Cool and creepy scene, but not likely. Why would they dump it? Wouldn't they just recycle all of it?6. The Flesh Show - hunting down the robots the bikers shoot these discs that stick on the back of a robot and a powerfull magnet makes them stick to the metal walls in a shanty-town. Lucky the bots didn't stay in the woods. Seems like nets and electrical disrupters (like the Jawas in Star Wars) would be used more (some nets were used).7. The framing of Gigolo Joe - just like HJO he is a robot and his memory would be easily viewed by the authorities to see he was innocent of murder and they would also have a picture of the man who did it (her human husband/lover). Also, a point is made of him being licensed to provide his services. Wouldn't it make sense that he would be programmed to contact emergency services in the event that one of his customers had a heart attack or died? The police should have known everything he saw in the room within a minute of it happening. I could understand if he was some sort of black-market bot that had been modified by criminals, but he was a licensed, law-abiding bot.8. Voice acting - Chris Rock as the bot that was shredded and Robin Williams as Dr. Know were a little distracting.9. Dr. Know, kept thinking: ""Do you expect me to talk?"" ""No Mr. Bond, I expect you to die."" Even though that was Goldfinger who said that.10. There should have been no way that the police flyer could be stolen, voice codes, scanners, DNA sniffers, etc. should have prevented a bot from stealing it. HOWEVER, by then the company that made HJO could have arranged it so that he could take it, they did want to see what he would do.11. If bots were restricted from Manhattan, the flyer would not have let them enter, except the company would have overridden this.12. David finds out about himself and sees the boxes of Davids and Darlenes, one of the David boxes moves. Very creepy and cool scene, but why would one of the Davids be turned on?13. David is in the flyer and trapped in ice for 2000 years. The flyer probably would have collapsed from the increased pressure when the water froze. HJO and Teddy probably would have been okay anyway though.14. Every time Teddy talked, I kept thinking of Funzo in The Simpsons and him saying, ""I have a flower por vou.""15. What some of you think are aliens thaw out HJO. Okay, first of all there is about a 99.9% chance these are NOT aliens, but are robots. They even say, when they find HJO and Teddy, ""These are ORIGINAL robots, they actually knew humans."" This implies they themselves are the descendents of robots. Second, why are they human shaped? They appear to have mastered magnetic fields, electrical fields, and gravitational fields, it would make the most sense for them to incorporate this into their own bodies instead of the blocky vehicles, and be a more streamlined shape such as a sphere or maybe a horizontal tear-drop shape. I could understand if they changed into human shape just before waking HJO, but we see them in this shape the whole time.16. The ending cloning thing was just silly. The best ending (beyond ending it with HJO looking at the blue fairy at the bottom of the ocean) would have been the futurebots tricking him into thinking he was back home, this way they could make him think he was real and actually have him grow up and age, reproduce, and live out a natural life. Much like the Star Trek where the self-aware Moriarty from the Holodeck was tricked and kept in a simulation.

What I got instead was a piece of drivel that you can hardly call a movie, especially not a film by a world-renowned director.  The film was the laugh-out loud comedy of the year instead.  It was so pathetic, unoriginal, and impossible that you had to laugh at it.  I kept thinking that the film was going to get better as it went along, but it never did.  It was one of the only films this year that I've considered walking out on.  The acting in this film was awful; Haley Joel Osmond gave a basic performance that didn't stretch his ability as ""The Sixth Sense"" did.  The rest of the cast gave sub-par performances also, excluding the one ray of light in this film Jude Law as Gigolo Joe and the mechanical Teddy.  The scene selection was also horrible. Take the flesh fair scene where the robots are destroyed in front of an audience.  Did anyone notice the remarkable resemblance to the scenes of ""The Running Man"".  The end was very pathetic indeed.  When I saw the alien ship 2,000 years later, I nearly laughed at its plausibility and value in this movie.  A.I. said nothing important, had poor acting, had no memorable scenes, and will be remembered as a flop in an otherwise magnificent career of Steven Spielberg.

This movie was originally to be directed by the late (& great) Stanley Kubrick, and Steven Spielberg stepped in.  I know not what the movie was to be like with Kubrick at the helm, and it would have definitely been a much different film, but Kubrick would have loved this movie.  This movie should already have a spot reserved for itself as a nominee for next year's Best Screenplay and Best Picture Oscars.The film (adapted from a short story) keeps you on the edge of your seat with a incredibly endearing and involving plotline.  The movie deals with loving a robotic creation, and the performance of Haley Joel Osment does that for the viewer.  You grow to love ""David"", which may possibly be one of the greatest pure ""heroes"" in the last few years of film.  While the viewer spends the beginning of the movie growing attached to this character, you also search for a clean-cut ""bad guy,"" but there isn't a single antagonist. The supporting cast perfectly compliments Osment's performance.  Jude Law rebounds from a sub par performance in Enemy at the Gates, and Frances O'Connor should make a name for herself after this great performance. Jack Angel provides the voice of an intelligent futuristic walking, talking teddy bear that ""David"" takes a liking to.Steven Spielberg has done it again.

Character development was rushed to the point that you don't like or care about anyone (except Teddy).  If the movie had ended after the second act, it would not have been that bad, but then came the third act.  This part was totally unnecessary, and nothing more than annoying.  As soon as the third act began, I thought that it would be a quick wrap up, but it went on for what seemed like an hour.  Every time I thought they were going to wrap it up, there was a new development.  It was as though the film makers realized that they had no ending, so they just kept adding ""stuff"" so that they wouldn't have to face that fact.

He also, alludes to the answer as being that God created them so that He would have a creation that would love Him (sounding for merely selfish reasons). But the movie tells a story that deliberately contradicts that answer. God created us not only to love Him, but He put in us the need for love. God designed in all of us the need to be loved, and the movie shows us the reality of that truth.

The only reason its being measured is because the government is giving some grad student and his friends a billion dollars to test for Global warming.Their findings, the earth has warmed a half a degree over the last ten years(its changed more than that in the time it takes you to read this review) and they estimate that the ice caps are melting at 1.8mm per year. If the time frame in the movie is correct, the ice caps would have melted 90mm.  Since ice is 10 times denser than water, the oceans would have risen 9mm or about 11/32 of an inch.

First off I should say that I am a huge fan of Kubrick and his films, and he is without a doubt the greatest film maker of our time.  I should also say that I like a good deal of things that Spielberg puts his hands into.  Yes, he's made some great films, but he is not the best of the best out there.  I state that because of some of his sappy endings and liberty's with a storyline.  However, his directing style is wide, and he should be commended for giving his time and money for some great films in the past, and also for some superb animated television as well.  A.I. is a very different film for Spielberg, and only he could do this film with his vision of love and dreams.  Kubrick is gone, and he most likely would have made A.I. too dark, mainly because this film is dark enough already.   This movie is not a fairy tale...it is not Pinocchio. It is not for kids.  Those subjects do happen to be the backbone of the plot, and those things already exist in our present ""realities"".  A.I. also deals with other present day subjects like religion, sex, ignorance, our human psychology, and our reactions to those things in our so called modern world. This film, set in the 22nd century, should be understood, but it seems to be dismissed as just a ""Spielberg"" film lost in a sappy ending.  Which is funny to me, because it doesn't have a sappy ending.  It is sad for David that he in not real, but it is also quite hopeful and beautiful that he wants to love unconditionally.  Finally it deals with the future of the planet Earth.  If we make robots that do live past humans....then it seems very logical for them to make themselves better.   A mirror of what humans do now for themselves, but without such the short life span that we encounter.

1214,orbfile23,Not religious enough for the masses.,7,4 July 2001,"(Spoilers galore, and you won't understand my point unless you've experienced the film)  It's been almost a day since I've seen A.I. for the first time, and I cannot wait to sit through this movie again.  First off I should say that I am a huge fan of Kubrick and his films, and he is without a doubt the greatest film maker of our time.  I should also say that I like a good deal of things that Spielberg puts his hands into.  Yes, he's made some great films, but he is not the best of the best out there.  I state that because of some of his sappy endings and the liberty's he takes with a storyline.  However, his directing style is wide, and he should be commended for giving his time and money for some great films in the past, and also for some superb animated television as well.  A.I. is a very different film for Spielberg, and only he could do this film with his vision of love and dreams.  Kubrick is gone, and he most likely would have made A.I. too dark, mainly because this film is dark enough already.   This movie is not a fairy tale...it is not Pinocchio.  It is not for kids.  Those subjects do happen to be the backbone of the plot, and those things already exist in our present ""realities"".  A.I. also deals with other present day subjects like religion, sex, ignorance, our human psychology, and our reactions to those things in our so called modern world.  This film, set in the 22nd century, should be understood, but it seems to be dismissed as just a ""Spielberg"" film lost in a sappy ending.  Which is funny to me, because it doesn't have a sappy ending at all.  The human race is gone.  It is sad for David that he is does not become real, but it is also quite hopeful and beautiful that he wants to love unconditionally, and he gets his dream.  Finally it deals with the future of the planet Earth.  If we make robots that do live past humans....then it seems very logical for them to make themselves better.

1215,jam8317,A 10/10...if Spielberg had quit 20 minutes earlier,6,8 July 2001,"A.I. Artificial Intelligence is the most thought-provoking film I've seen since Memento earlier this year.  The music and lighting were masterful, the acting was superb, and the storyline was better than expected.  And the technology and special effects are amazing.  You definitely get that prickly feeling on your neck that comes from every Kubrick film.  At the same time, though, the story and lighting are distinctly Spielberg's. The score, which fittingly hints of Kubrick's 2001, compliments the story perfectly.I have a feeling audiences will be seeing a lot of great work from Jude Law as the robot Gigolo Joe. His plastic-like appearance is a perfect compliment to his stellar performance.  Haley Joel Osment proves he's not just another childhood star we'll never remember 20 years from now.  He convincingly portrays David, who could (and often does) pass for human if not for his robotic movements.  David even has his own mecha toy, Teddy, a robotic teddy bear that is an absolute riot.  Osment deserves an Oscar nomination, and unless there's some shockingly good lead male performances in movies yet to come this year, he should win it.The only thing wrong with A.I. is that Spielberg just couldn't resist the urge to, well, be Spielberg.  The ending is way too sappy.  Without revealing the ending, there is a much better time to end the film--about 20 minutes earlier than he did.  Of course it wouldn't have been a ""happily ever after"" story, but Kubrick films aren't supposed to be that way, anyway. Overall, an 8/10, mostly because the end doesn't do the rest of the story justice.  I can only hope the director's cut will play it out a little differently.",A.I. Artificial Intelligence

But this time you went too far away. Probably I missed the point. Probably I´m an stupid ignorant that´s unable to get in touch with the true sense of the film. That´s possible. But I DO remember the words of HAL 9000 in 2010: ""...will I dream??..."".

1218,GGreene,Spielberg on Love on Human Destiny,10,28 June 2001,"If I never see a better movie than A.I. -- a more ambitious, intriguing, thoughtful, beautiful or satisfying one -- I won't be terribly disappointed, or even surprised. Spielberg (the benevolent, optimist, ecumenical humanist who favors the open cinematic style of Renoir) uses his great gift to transform a story with shades of Kubrick (the brilliant misanthropic satirist who used the closed, deterministic style of Lang) to tell the story of human spiritual yearning. That's not a subject that critics are comfortable with, so beware their misgivings and carpings and falsifying comparisons, especially their supposed fealty to how Kubrick would have done it. I remind readers that while they claim to idolize Kubrick (now that he's dead and they never have to sit through another of his movies) they've been picking him apart since the beginning. ""The movie is so completely absorbed in its own problems,"" The New York Times wrote about 2001 in 1968, ""its use of color and space, its fanatical devotion to science-fiction detail, that it is somewhere between hypnotic and immensely boring.""Remember that when you read bad things about A.I. Spielberg suffers the same misunderstanding and refusal to accept his movies on his terms from critics who, frankly, miss the point or deliberately avoid it so that they can seem unimpressed. I have no such interest in remaining cool about a movie as passionate as A.I. I can't tell you much without spoiling the pleasure of discovery that lies ahead; I can never see it again for the first time. (So, as Truffaut says to Dreyfuss in Close Encounters: ""I envy you."") So let me speak in hopefully helpful generalities: It's a movie about love and man's spiritual journey, his relationship to God throughout history (you can watch it pass, in fact, from Old Testament allegory through an age of modern skepticism). There are images of Kubrickean human cruelty and suffering made all the more excruciatingly haunting by the contrast of Spielberg's sweetness and delicacy. (Bring no children, by the way: Savor the time you'll know they're ready for it.) Without giving away the ending, just contemplate Pinocchio's meaning, opened up for adults as if it's a myth. For what is the wish ""Make me a real boy"" but a timeless prayer that means ""Make me worthy of love""? Don't miss this one, folks. It can restore your faith in cinema, if not something far more important.",A.I. Artificial Intelligence
1219,fido64,I found myself dumbstruck by what I had just experienced...,9,29 June 2001,"A.I. Artificial Intelligence is a must see film for those who love the work of director Steven Spielberg. Full of profound, and thought provoking imagery, the viewer is transported into a world where the lines of fantasy and reality are blended into a tapestry of deep felt paternal emotion; while bringing to the surface of the soul the deep and ever present question... ""Who are we really?""Even though there were elements of the production which I felt were truly unnecessary other than to gain a PG13 rating, I found myself sitting in the theater at the end of the movie somewhat dumbstruck by what I had just experienced.I do not believe any review... good, bad, or indifferent (especially mine) will do this film justice. One needs to see and experience this film for themselves. I do not believe they will be disappointed. It is after all a Steven Spielberg film... need more be said?",A.I. Artificial Intelligence
1220,fido64,I was dumbstruck by what I had just seen....,9,1 July 2001,"(My apologies to the editors if you in fact got my first one... I was not sure, I am new at this... please feel free to delete if you wish)AI is a must see movie... As I sat in the theater watching the rolling credits, I was dumbstruck at what I had just seen. While I would not go so far as to call it a ""masterpiece"", I was deeply moved by the tapestry of emotion that was woven within the storyline; playing both on one's paternal instincts as well as the nagging question that is deep within all of all of us... ""who are we really?"" There were several scenes that were not necessary... (other than to perhaps gain a PG13 rating) and for that I was quite disappointed. Jude Law's Character was weak at best, in my opinion he was really no more useful than that poor excuse for a mechanical ewok of teddy bear that accompanied them. If there was supposed to be subplot regarding Law's Character that was later ""cut"" that was fine. However one should not tease the audience with an introduction then pull the rug out from underneath them.Young Mr. Osment once again provided a stellar performance. I would have liked have seen a further look into the complexity involved in the development of the parent child (or machine) relations. My question is, how did dad REALLY feel about David? Osment's character possessed a pleasant innocence about him that was refreshing, and reminiscent of a time when young people where in fact that innocent and trusting. As for the ending (no spoilers I promise) I have only one question... what was Spielberg thinking?! A trinitarian approach.... 3 plots in one?I guess we can all nitpick any great movie to death, and no review will completely do this effort true justice. The only way to truly understand this movie is to see it for yourself. You will not be disappointed that much I can be sure.

1222,KaiLubbe,Shocker!!,1,30 June 2001,"My fiancee & I have come to the consensus (yes it only took two of us) that this is the worst film we've seen.  Let me qualify that.  We went & saw 'What Dreams May Come'.  For a few years now, that movie had reigned supreme, it's infantile script & vapid attempts at philosophy unparalleled by would-be-contenders (including such notables as 'Get Carter' & 'Pitch Black'!).But watch out guys!  There's a new kid on the block & let me tell you, ole' Mr Kubrick's rolling in his grave.  Let's just say that I could craft a more substantial plot of gossamer.  Or perhaps that this movie reads like an abstract painting, which'd be ok if that wasn't done by a mindless chimp whacked out on too many episodes of 'Hook' (yes, the TV cartoon).AI's artlessness is unrelenting.  You'd think they'd get some things right just by accident, but the whole thing's a colossal flop.  You'll gasp at the paucity of imagination when you meet the 'Blue Fairy' beneath the seas of Man-hattan (get it, they're not men, they're cyborgs!)Here's what I think happened: Spielberg was sitting in his den cobbling together this wonderland fable & he kept getting interrupted by a  4 year old:""How 'bout this Daddy?""""Oo, Oo!""""I've got a new good idea.""""...and then they go here & do that, & now they do this....""The whole movie seems like it's trying to distract you from itself.

If you see this movie and soon after dismiss it as usual Spielberg fair, you've missed the point of it's message.  Roger Ebert (while still giving it a *** star review) completely overlooked that the point of the movie was to show how humans can easily separate themselves from the things they create.  He wanted the movie to build on the separation from mother and son and forgot that this is not what Spielberg wanted to get across.  And as for those of you who still harp on the fact the the movie ran too long, it would have been a sin for Spielberg to stop the movie where you thought it should have.  The only mistake that was made was the narrator's speech and the pull back of the camera.  I believe the camera should have pulled back with no narration...two totally different crowd expectations.  I believe S.K. would have been proud of this movie and what Spielberg did with it.",A.I. Artificial Intelligence
1224,JDGross,Two and a Half Wasted Hours...,3,2 July 2001,"This was a visually impressive well acted piece of techno garbage.  Don't fault the actors - they did well enough.  Don't fault the special effects people -- they did very well.  Fault the writing, most notably Steven Spielberg, for whom I have a wealth of respect, but whose work on this film falls far short of his usual norms.  The story's premise is fatally flawed, it's telling is worse, and the bizarre ending could have and should have been totally avoided.While turning Pinocchio into a post-modern fairy tale probably sounded like a good idea at the time, the actual execution of the movie has given us something that almost ranks with the worst of the Saturday Night Live Specials (it's Pat, et al).That being said, Haley Joel Osment again turns in a good performance, showing us that his talents, once refined and matured into adulthood, may very well be enjoyed on the screen for decades to come.  Jude Law also puts in a thoroughly enjoyable performance as the gigolo robot with the onboard speaker system.  William Hurt was good in his too-brief scenes, though his character was left largely undeveloped.  Truly, the teddy bear steals the show and should be up for the Best Supporting Stuffed Robot Oscar.
The effects of the over-sexualized Rouge Town were visually stunning, but overly cold and dreary, and the characters seemed somehow misplaced. Worse, though, then ending leaves much to be desired, and the entire last half-hour could easily have been removed.  While I thoroughly enjoy Ben Kingsley as an actor, his narration on this film was entirely unnecessary and often duplicative to the onscreen story.So, in summary: a 3 out of 10.  One point for the effects, one for the acting, one for the teddy bear, and a lengthy trip to the woodshed for Mr. Spielberg.",A.I. Artificial Intelligence
1225,bastthecat,"Character Breakdown ""oh, the humanity""",10,3 July 2001,"I had already figured a movie about a robot child who can love would have to focus on their ""Programming of Love"" - and I had this idea that the child's love would be more pure, more unconditional than a human's. I expected the boy robot to be more honest and true, and therefore , dare I say, Better at it? Than the humans.  I feel humans are taught love, and their idea of love is warped by experience and baggage. What the movie proved to me was that humans are warped, period - and I was okay with that. Number one- The gross insincerity of creating David was blatant in the first scene. David was a gimmicky effort at creating (Frankenstein pun intended) pure profit. ""If we build it -they will buy"", the Professor seemed to say. I felt no depth from his character. I did not understand his drive, his ambition unless it was greed and infamy. I felt no closer to him in the final scene when we learn he had immortalized his own son David, in this Beta-bot. What kind of sincere father wants to be haunted by seeing his dead son's visage marketed to hundreds? Where was his wife, she would never have allowed it. The Professor did use Mecha- David as a guinea pig, just a test case to check the genuineness of David's emotions and attachments. If Mecha-David had slaughtered thousands on the way to the Blue Fairy, I don't think the professor was the admirable kind of character who would have stopped productions on his ""Davids"" -no. They would have rolled right out on schedule.Number two: Mommy. Her character confuses me. The optimism she displayed by reading to her son Martin in Cryogenic freeze makes me fail to believe she would have imprinted with Mecha-David so soon. Her resiliency to accept Mecha David at first seems quite genuine. But her desire to love and be loved by something gives her a slant of Robotic-ness herself. Does she need to love, or be loved, or both. Is David not enough for her because of her internal ""mother program"", i.e - hormones? I was devastated when she dropped him off in the woods. I felt her mother-program had some poorly written code.  I wanted her to choose ""David"" somehow as Martin was obviously ""the Bad seed"".Martin and the pool kids: This is the key to understanding humanity at its' basest level. David shows us everything magical about being a child (different colored crayons for words and letters, noticing the tappiness of the hard floor, the careful study of coffee preparation), this is how children learn. Martin reminds of  how cruel we can be, though curious. Manipulation, scrutiny, and survival-after all, Monica was his Mommy first. Poking David with a knife proves he is not a real boy. David is different -Different is wrong, fascinating, but wrong. ""What happens if we...."" is the heart of every new discovery, though.Joe: I loved this character every instant. I loved his inability to perceive ""David"" as a CHILD. He just went on - blah-blah sex like he was talking to just another client. The only emotion I felt from him was pride. He didn't seem fear-ful, really. I doubted his ability to jump into the complex conversation he had with David after they saw Dr. Know.  He was a typical ""pleasure model"" (like Pris from Bladerunner) - I do not think he would have ""felt"" all the opinions about people. His allegiance to David is questionable, in my opinion. Blue fairy- just another female figure letting Mecha-David down. She did appear eerie like all those chalkware Madonnas from Church. She never granted any of my childhood wishes or prayers either, David. I feel for you.David: Just a Beta Bot for marketing research. He showed every human emotion we could ask for - fear, sorrow, anger, envy,  creativity, desire, guilt, compassion, inquisitiveness and unconditional love. I love Osmet for making me believe he was David, and he's really incredibly talented - so talented I wish there was ""a room full of him"" b/c we know he's going to grow up and loose this Child-like innocence in Hollywood. I fell into this movie actually only concerned with David's happiness. It made me want to make sure my son feels my love as powerfully as I can give it.  All the little things in the movie that could have been hindrances, just slipped away - nothing held me in the theatre - I was there with the story. . I enjoyed the ending. ""Life finds a way"" (jurassic park) and I was glad to see David uncovered-and to see that in the end it was just them. I hoped that when the blue fairy crumbled, so would all of his memories from the past. I am so glad the super-mechas gave him a day of happy. I don't understand why they couldn't take out the ""mommy imprint"", but then, that would have destroyed his ""living script"" as the scribe of the human era.  He was the most human of all these characters. Damn me, I would have bought one.",A.I. Artificial Intelligence

This somewhat interesting question is the underlying message that A.I. is based on, yet never quite comes to a solid conclusion. Whether or not it was the Kubrick's intent for this question to be answered doesn't really matter; what matters is that the filmmakers give the viewer a solid gateway into the process of pondering this question. A.I. does just the opposite. With a question such as this offered, one would think Kubrick/Spielberg would have given us a fitting film, instead of opting for a childish fairytale with 'adult' elements mixed-in (dark scenes, robotic prostitution, etc). Kubrick's '2001' had a fitting atmosphere for its intent, but A.I. lacks this essential element. An example of its immaturity: near the end of the film, David sits underwater (until he freezes) for 2000 years praying to 'Blue Fairy' to make him a real boy. This in itself is laughable. The acting is quite good, even though many characters are used poorly and/or don't quite have a purpose in the overall scheme of things.

1228,patrick_oswald,Deep movie shallowly interpreted,10,6 July 2001,"**SPOILERS**AI contains many level of meanings and unfortunately much of the audience focuses only the shallow level, and misses the really worthy part.
On the surface, this is sci-fi movie with quite a bit of emotional contents. The futuristic settings, the quest of a child robot to become a human and to receive his mother's love, the violent action of humans against future robots.Certainly the story is interesting, though contains a few flaws especially at the end where the story sometimes feel contrived and not-so-scientific.However, the real meat of this movie is on a deeper level. It talks about humanity and the meaning of life. It presents a wide range of human beliefs, emotions, and thoughts.Part I--Attachment: love, companionship (mother to child, child to mother, robots to robots);Part II--Detachment: jealousy, hate, violence, fear; and
Part III--Ignorance: belief in self, pride, desire, faith, attachment, detachment.Many other reviews have talked about Attachment and Detachment, but not so much was discussed about Ignorance presented in the film.
**You may not want to read further if you haven't seen the movie. Spoiler ahead.**In the part III, David found another robot like himself and he became truly disappointed; in fact, fear--so much that he destroyed the robot. This is the first time that he used violence himself. He always believed that he was unique; he is proud of himself at least for this. The fact that there are other robots identical to him destroyed this pride and  attacked his deepest existential belief.I believe a major reason that he committed suicide was this.Then another type of ignorance--faith--started, he prayed and continued to pray for thousands of years until he was waken up by the revealing experience that what he believed in was just as fragile as any other thing is.Then, the movie moves on to desire, which is related to attachment. His need of maternal love is more than pure love. It is based on deep desire to be cared, to be loved back. Although the desire was fulfilled, it was only temporary. The real fact of life is that everything is temporary. Although David may live very long, but everything else changes. In fact, nothing stays constant, even David himself.That's the only fact of life.",A.I. Artificial Intelligence

The end. Totally, completely unnecessary. When David was in the ship underwater, praying to the Blue Fairy, I said in my mind, ""And cut."" The screen faded. I almost cheered--a movie that ended on a bleak note! And a completely true one: We cannot change our natures. David was not human. David would never be human, no matter how much he hoped and prayed to his Blue Fairy. A GOOD outcome of the story, a TRUE outcome of the story, and, considering Kubrick's involvement, a REASONABLE outcome to expect (Remember A Clockwork Orange?) would have been to cut it underwater. Well. I cringed through the last half hour--drenched in sap, not how I would have ended it AT ALL, and just... wrong.It wasn't even the huge jump to the future that bothered me. I was fine with the ice, and the alien-looking robots. Their dissolving-box transport system was pretty freakin' cool. If they'd found a frozen David, praying forever to his fairy, preserved as a monument to the futility of wishing to change one's nature, I still would have been fine. But no, they gave him that one stupid day, and his mother ""loved"" him, and he went to sleep (something that a robot could not do, signifying that he had somehow changed his physical makeup--huh?).

That is what I consider to be the beautiful thing about this film.Admittedly, the film was a little long at nearly two and a half hours. However, the acting talent more than made up for this short-coming. I was completely blown away by Haley Joel Osment's portrayal of David, the robot boy. Osment brings life and reality into this role, which was a difficult task for any actor. I expect to see great things in his future. Also, Jude Law was great in his role though the development of the character could have been more. What brings such emotion into this film are the character relationships. Clearly, David gets a raw deal in the film, but it isn't as cut and dried as that. The character's actions in this film are justified from their points of view. The mother's concern for the safety of her biological son drives her to abandon David, but her love for David keeps her from sending him to certain destruction. Also, David's response to not being unique is justifiable in his situation. This is another point which I thought made the film complex. Blame is difficult to assign to any one character.To sum it up: This film is a piece of art. It poses deep questions about humanity and leaves us to find the answers. The content of the film suggests that young children probably shouldn't view it however. This one of only a few stand-out movies I've seen in years. I give it a ten.",A.I. Artificial Intelligence
1234,stratmanjd,"Deep questions, difficult answers.",10,15 July 2001,"This film is a piece of art. It is truly one of the best movies I've seen in years. At the very least, it was refreshing. I have some very great things to say about this film as well as some minor things, though the good more than outweighed the bad. I'll first say what was negative about it.The film obviously wasn't for small children due to its sometimes disturbing content. It was also a longer movie, which in this case isn't exactly a bad thing. It wasn't to me anyway. The only other negative thing about this movie was that Jude Law's character wasn't developed as well as it could have been. I wish some more of the plot would have focused on his character. Well, that's it for the negatives. Let's look at the good things.The film had a great plot, great script, and excellent acting. Haley Joel Osment continues to show his great acting talent as David, the robot child programmed to love his parents. He brought great realism to this film and did an excellent job playing his character. It couldn't have been an easy role for anyone. I expect to see great things from him in the future. Jude Law was also great in his limited role as Gigolo Joe. The special effects were awesome as expected. The movie was simply jaw-dropping beautiful to watch. It was as much a treat for the eyes as it was for the mind.As for the film itself, it can only be called a work of art. No, it isn't perfect, but neither is art. The film drives at the deep questions about humanity and love. It asks us some deep questions but doesn't spoon-feed us the answers. It lets us decide for ourselves. That is what art does for us. This film still had me thinking days afterward. I loved this film precisely because it moved on many different levels. Personally, I love this film and give it my highest recommendation.

There were also a few technical questions... If the half-life of Plutonium is a couple hundred years, what is powering this robot after 2000 years?  Ice ages occur gradually, 2000 years is considered a short period of time, geologically speaking.  With the knowledge of today's technology, and looking into the foreseeable future, A.I. can never be achieved.  All computers can do is make yes/no decisions based on parameters entered by humans.

I;ve seen this act described as Spielberg's attempt to inject a holocaust theme into the movie...perhaps this is so but I believe that would be to undermine what to me is a more important perpsective on man's inability to be humane compared to the synthetic humanity of the mechas...for me this is a central motif of the movie and is brought to a neat conclusion by the future jump in act 3 where we see the natural superiority of the mechas brought to fruition by the 'darwinian' evolutionary process.Act 3 is a schizophrenic piece of work...melding Kubricks's tendency for a bleak and somehow vague termination with no neat ends with Spielberg's tendency for the feelgood ending.  Ultimately the thematic elements of the movie discussed above are let down by Spielberg's need to reconcile the son/mother relationship, in particular the use of the evolved robots who now rule the earth as a substitute for humanity by endowing them with human sentimentality.So...my conclusion...a movie on two levels...lots of themes entered into and not resolved hark to the Kubrick influence but with some tightening of the plot/narrative and a neat ending by Spielberg.  Altogether I would say that what Spielberg adds is 'accessability' to a movie that I'm sure will develop with subsequent viewings... ...and for this Mr Spielberg...well done !",A.I.

In a few years GPS technology will be incorporated in most of our civilization.  This allows the tracking of stray robots and stolen police helicopters.* If you see light ahead for civilization and you think many things will get better, you will hate this movie. - This movie portays daddy as very cold, with a strange relationship with his wife.  He brings the robot home but takes little responsibility from that point. - The house is designed with a lack of style that is full of life. - Vehicles are the typical futurist variety.  Believe me, years from now there will be 1968 Mustangs on the road, as well as other classic styles and antiques.  Heck, I see 60 year cars today, why would they not see old cars in the future.* DO YOU WANT ENTERTAINMENT? - This movie is MEAN SPIRITED, DARK, with no likable humans characters, ecspecially a mom that abandons a robot witnhout rightful cause. No happy endings, no feel good accomplishments, and no hurdling of problems to obtain a successful desired end.* Do you require good science? - Not even close. Tomorrow's scientist will be smarter than today's, yet even today's science knows better than to: a. build a tube from the mouth opening to electronic components. b. allow robots close to swimming pools. c. allow harm to come to owners, even through peer pressure. d. distribute robots without GPS systems. e. not utilize hard drives to review eye/ear inputs data acquired by robots to determine past events.  It would have been real helpful in the pool incident, the evil son getting robot to cut hair of mom, and robot framed for murder.  It also would have caught the real murderer. f. Easy turn off / deactivation by long range remote. g. Make police vehicles without GPS, security biometrics to activate, etc.So for those say this is an intelligent movie - wrong!  What you really mean is, this is a philiosophical movie with liberal ideas that you agree with.  Though I think even liberals would never allow the mean-spirited caging, humilation, and torture of robotic humanoids.Misnomer from start.  William hurt says ""God created man to love Him."" Close but wrong.  God created man with the capacity to love Him and others BUT gave man the ability to choose for himself those he would love.  God never made man love Him, God loved us FIRST, and many responded by loving Him back, most others did not.Intelligent? I watch documentaries and read books for this.  Those that say this is an intelligent movie for intelligent viewers, need to read some non-fiction and watch some good documentaries.Entertaining? If you think mean-spirited dark futurism is entertaining, yes. If you like fell-good movies, no.Good acting? YesEffects? YesInteresting? YesCharacterization? No - Inconsistant charaters without depth.  You do not find yourself caring about any of them.Storyline - Inconsistant. Ocean creep floods cities but no one seems to dismantle anything.  Lacked good adventure with a few exceptions.  Towards the end - MOST RIDICULOUS ITEM - The creator goes to length to get the boy to the end of the journey - then leaves him.  You do not leave a robotic boy that just murdered his robotic rival out of jealousy.  Of course the boy jumps into the ocean for 2000 years.BTW: End with Advanced robots that look more like Hollywood aliens. Humans are all dead. The boy robot is 2000 years old and has no hope of meeting back up with mom, being turned into a boy.  He gets to live a fake 1 day with an image of mom.  Happy ending?WHY DO YOU GO TO A MOVIE?

I had to drag my girlfriend along with me to the cinema. The main reason that I had for still being interested in A.I. was the fact Stanley Kubrick had worked on it. One of the reasons for my lack of trust in this film was the involvement of a certain mister Spielberg. I am not very fond of most of his movies, for they lack depth and they are the kind of sentimental, crowd-pleasing entertainment that Hollywood has become so notorious for. But after seeing A.I. I will forever respect Steven Spielberg as a true artist.I understood why this film had done so badly in the US and why it had received so much negative publicity: it was too intelligent. While watching A.I. I was stunned over and over again by its ability to raise important philosophical and social issues. It is the kind of film Socrates or Friedrich Nietzsche would enjoy, if they would be around these days.It is a journey into the mind and into the soul of humanity; searching for questions and answers concerning our existence and the meaning of our presence. It is very good that the film doesn't provide any real answers to the questions it raises. If it would have tried to, A.I. would have been just another unrealistic Hollywood, sci-fi-blockbuster. But it doesn't. Pretending to know the answers to the most important questions of life, would be arrogant and stupid; a bit like the United States' political image in the world today.It was very brave of Steven Spielberg to avoid pleasing the crowd with easy answers and a normally developing story. I didn't only enjoy the story: the acting and the SFX were breathtaking as well. I can't believe that a boy as young as Haily-Joel Osment can act  like he does. After the 6th Sense another incredible performance by him. For me there is no doubt that A.I. is the best movie of 2001.",A.I. Artificial Intelligence

1254,diuscooley,An upsetting look at the relationship between human beings and the things we create.,8,15 November 2021,"A. I. Artificial Intelligence is a film that very early on poses the question of what responsibility a living, breathing human would have to an artificial being programmed ""to love"". Our screenwriter (in this case the one and only Spielberg) doesn't seem to give us an outright answer, but the story certainly doesn't paint humanity in the kindest of lights.There are no truly sympathetic human characters here, only a handful that hide capitalistic desires behind a sympathetic guise such as the father at the Flesh Fair and Prof. Hobby. Now, there are of course those we can forgive for their weaknesses.Can we blame the mother (brilliantly portrayed by Frances O'Connor) for her actions? After all, is it selfish to think you can heal faster than you're capable? With her husband and son constantly gaslighting her against David, we can understand that her abandoning our protagonist in the woods was, in her mind, the best thing she could do to do right by both David and her ""real"" family. And even though the portrayal isn't necessarily flattering, her son Martin's action, though not condonable, can be at least understood. To come home from the hospital to find, in her grief, your mother replaced you with a cheaper more versatile version of you can be a tough thing to process, much less for a child.The movie has that ethereal glow that is reminiscent of other Spielberg films such as Minority Report and even Close Encounters. The sci-fi future shines bright, even in its dark and dreary locations such as the futuristic Sodom that is Rouge City or the Flesh Fair, the latter being a particularly dark metaphor. The signs at the Flesh Fair all read ""A Celebration of Life"", as the participants all cheer and call for the destruction of that which they fear. I'm sure a number of parallels can be drawn to things going on in the world at the moment.Real kudos must be given to our two strongest characters, portrayed by Haley Joel Osment and Jude Law. I can only reiterate what so many have already said of Osment during this period, so I'll simply say his range at this age is nothing short of prodigious. Having the protagonist be this innocent character who is both literally discovering everything for the first time but is also programmed to have a childlike wonder about him keeps the film from being too complicated. Following David makes the motivation easy to follow; he wants to be loved like Walter is loved and therefore he wants to be made real and deserving of this love.If we had instead followed his counterpart for much of the film, Gigolo Joe played by Law, the journey may have been a more philosophical one, with being made real being too simple and the question instead being what is it to be real? Joe, after all, has the best lines in the film. ""She loves what you do for her, as my customers love what I do for them"", ""We are suffering from their mistakes"", and of course ""I am. I was"".The musical score here by John Williams is very subtle throughout the majority of the film, never as emboldened as some of his other Spielberg collaborations like Jurassic Park or the Indiana Jones films, but the theme that plays throughout the final sequence where David is back ""home"" and gets to see his mother one last time is absolutely breathtaking and a true testament to why Williams is the greatest film composer of all time.If you take just about any Spielberg film you'll find those who accuse it of being overly sentimental, and this is certainly no different, though I find it amusing that the big sentimental ending was actually conceived by Kubrick in the early treatments of the story.The biggest drawback to the film is something I've already mentioned, and it's that so many deep and interesting ideas are brought up but never fully explored or expanded upon because our protagonist's journey is so straightforward through this dark vision of the future. David's entire journey is the drawn-out equivalent of the test Prof. Hobby conducts during the film's opening, where that initial question is asked:If we can create something that can think, feel pain, reason with its surroundings, and love, what is our responsibility to that thing? It's a question that still feels relevant 20 years later.",A.I. Artificial Intelligence

By producing a robot who feels, man is placing himself on the pedestal of God, who has the power to give and take away life at will. David never asked to love Monica, yet he unconditionally and blindly loves her, even after her abandonment of him. Henry shows even less love for the mecha, even though it was his idea to introduce him into the house (yes, he was picked, but he could have refused on the spot), as soon as his own child was threatened, he suggested to remove David immediately. This kind of care reflects how selfish humans are.David is the perfect representation of what humans should be, who blindly love, and have an inate need to be protected from harm. Everyone tries to protect him, Teddy, Joe Giggalo, Monica.. yet it is he who tries to take his own life when his Masters can not deal with his presence.

You can watch A.I on two levels; you can let spielberg take you on an epic emotional ride, or you can really look at the film and what it all means. This film is a manipulative masterpiece. It bends you and pulls you in all different directions so that by the end you don't know what's going on. When i saw this film first, i felt dazed, confused, and abused. I think spielberg crosses the line in trying to make the story touching (although he didn't really need to try), and ended up making it sadistic. When you try to make sense of ai emotionally, it;s all over the place, characters motivations don't really seem to be thought out. The story is bizarre in places and unbelievable, yet you almost don't see it because spielberg is so adept at manipulating the audience. While carried away on the emotion and the stirring music, it's difficult to look at what's going on objectively. Ai makes you feel incredibly emotionally involved, yet there is always a niggling doubt about how much sense the film actually makes. Underneath all the dripping emotion Spielberg has laid on, AI's story takes unbelievable twists and turns, it has THE worst voice over ever written, and the treatment of the boy by everyone in the film and fate itself is so cruel and sadistic when you actually think about it that it is incredible that this is supposed to be a kids film?!

1261,RoboCop001,One of the best movies ever made!,10,11 March 2002,"AI: Artificial Intelligence is definitely one of the best movies I have ever seen. It has a great story line that is actually a lot different than you will probably imagine from watching the trailers. It sure was for me. The main story is about a robot child who wishes to be human because he believes that if he accomplishes this, his ""mother"" will love him back. But there is also a smaller story about the relationship between the humans and the robots. The humans, a lot of them anyway, believe that the robots should all be destroyed because they think that when robots are created to do things for the humans, they are taking away something from the humans. They say that they are just ""getting rid of artificiality"" when they destroy them. This tells us, at least it tells me, that the world today probably won't accept a loving, feeling AI, or AI altogether. This, to me, is an issue because if we can't accept ourselves (I mean, look at the world today), how can we accept AI? This especially came to me when Monica (David's ""mother"") said, ""I'm sorry I didn't tell you about  the world."" and also when it was in the part of the movie with the ""Flesh Fair"". ""Flesh Fairs"" are places where robots are tortured by humans who don't belive AI is a good thing. In the end we are all machines. We are just made of different material. Even if this movie wasn't supposed to tell this message, it sure did come to me when I watched it. This movie is just amazing. Especially the ending which was totally unexpected.",A.I.

When I first started watching the movie I hoped to see the brilliant storytelling of Kubrick and a little of the mainstream of Spielberg.  Much to my disappointment, the movie seemed to gloss over most of the moments Kubrick would have milked and instead went for the 'oh, Haley, isn't that so sad-' moments. There was too much theatricalness in the movie and not enough gritty thought provoking film. It'll make you think, but I don't think it makes you think about what Kubrick would've intended. I enjoyed, yes, I thought it was a great film, and very well done.. BUT I wish it had been more true to a Kubrick style film - edgy, gritty, dark, nearly absurd in the best sense of the word.

David is an artificial intelligence: his emotions are real, his love is real, but he is not.Sent away by his ""parents"", David embarks on a mission of exploration together with Gigolo Joe (played well by Jude Law) to search for the Fairy who can turn him into a real boy.Sounds cliche? It's because it is. The main storyline is basically a retelling of earlier stories. And I wouldn't want to see this movie because of the above summary. But what stands out in this movie are the *moments*, and the adding of layers unto this unremarkable storyline. I won't spoil it for you, but rest assured that the genius of the late Kubrick combined with Spielbergs techniques gives intelligent viewers for something to ponder about.And, agreeing with other reviewers, people who go to movies and make sure their popcorn won't run out won't like it.

The problem is, it never did. While watching it with my fiancee, I was getting somewhat upset that I was letting her watch it at all.  For me, finding a movie I don't like is a very rare occurrence.This movie SHOULD have been a children's movie.  The trouble is, the way it was done would have been either too scary or too confusing for kids.* SPOILER *One scene that really bugged me was when the professor (the robot maker guy) found David after he had disappeared for so long.  First he expressed how enthused he was about introducing David to the robotic development team, and that they were nearby, just waiting to meet him.  Then he walked out of the room, never to be seen or heard from again.  What???  I think Spielberg cut some important scenes out of the movie by accident.  He must have thought it was getting pretty drawn out by that point.  He was right.Another questionable element was the low quality parenting.  You know that bad things are happening between your two sons, yet you constantly leave them alone together.  Come on!  Try a bit of adult supervision to find out what the stink is wrong with this robot!  You would have found that you should have left your REAL son in the woods, not the robot.There was a very high frustration factor caused by the poor parenting.  I don't think any person can possibly be as bad at parenting as these two. Yet, they were the best candidates the robot company could find to test out the new robot.  I thought the test was supposed to involve the love shared between a mother and her child.  Said 'mother' didn't even love her human son enough to keep a close observation on his interaction with the experimental robot.* END SPOILER *I gave this movie a 1 rating, although I considered giving it a 2 because the beginning was not too bad.  The main problem was the introduction of Gigolo Joe.  He was the turning point, because he was completely unrelated to the plot.  As each minute of the movie passed after his introduction, I was begging for an ending.The sexual overtones were completely USELESS to the story.  Spielberg could have cut the movie down to 90 minutes and lowered the age requirement to increase the audience.  I have nothing against Jude Law, but this movie would have easily been better without his character.

1275,bobafett67,near-masterpiece,10,14 April 2003,"This film should have been finished by Kubrick but wasn't due to his untimely death during Eyes Wide Shut and was then finished by Spielberg. In some aspects Spielberg makes the film more accessible but at a concession to the art and style that Kubrick would have wanted.  Still, though, this is as dark as I've ever seen Spielberg get (with exceptions of Schindler's List and Saving Private Ryan).  The vision of the future expressed here seems at this point in time that some of it could hold true (same goes for aspects of Minority Report and 2001).  Powerful performances from Osment and Law. Also enjoyed the cameo appearances, especially Robin Williams and Ben Kingsley, but seeing Al Jourgenson and Ministry thrash out on stage at the flesh fair was fun too.  People often complain that the ending seems to drag on, but I thought it most suitable, although some parts of the last 30 minutes could have been removed as the pace is slowed considerably from the other parts of the film.  The film is divided into 3 parts, with the third part arguably being the weakest.  I was expecting the ending to be different than what the tone of the first two sections conveyed.  Nonetheless I was still blown away by this film!  I think people have either been too harsh in their appraisals or perhaps just got bored out of being used to our ""technologically-advanced"" postmodern culture, and then being desensitized from that.

1279,Balhaarverzamelaar,Damn the ending,6,6 June 2004,"This movie is not too bad... For the first hour and a half or so. Although the story outline is not too original (it's Pinocchio all over again), it's visualized beautifully with superb special effects and good acting of Osment and Law. It raises some important philosophical issues like the ability of humans to love robots which can love humans and the striving of every individual to be special and unique (not necessarily the striving of an android to be a real boy). The way David is mocked by other children and even his 'dad', his despair when he finds out that he's far from unique and his perseverance to realize his dreams is filmed and acted convincingly enough to give the philosophy and ethics a proper place in this movie. All in all this film shouldn't have been this bad.And then we have this ending: after a few years of David's praying to a statue of the 'Blue Fairy', an ice age tortures the world for 2000 years (way too short for an ice age, by the way), aliens find the boy, tell him that he is unique, can resurrect his so-called mother with nothing more than a little hair and David has the happiest day in his life... It's not only very unlikely, it also has nothing to do with the story or the philosophical issues discussed.

1282,star-spangled,A Great Fatalist Piece,7,10 August 2010,"This review will contain spoilers, meant for audiences that have already seen this movie.Many questions popped up in my mind as to the authenticity of this film. Immediately I began to wonder about Professor Hobby and what I personally foreshadowed to be Dr. Frankenstein. I thought, already, that this movie was flawed. When a reporter sitting near him asks him the moral question along the lines of ""What would be the human responsibility when machines love us?"", I thought absolutely nothing. End of movie.As the scene drew to a close, I knew this was not over. We had only seen 10 minutes of the film, and that sickening motorization of the female prototype as it put on makeup gave an eerie feeling. I had not realized that there was more to AI than just motor functions. Neither did the media covering Cybertronics. And that is what I figured would be attempted here.It turns out this is not a sci-fi horror. This is not I Robot or I Am Legend. The simple fact is that humans are not the I, but They. AI are the creations, which the movie shows us essentially evolve as the the story progresses. At first you have this box TV with legs saying 90 years ago he was the hit fashion on Sharper Image magazine or the likes. When it came to David, I had to question his authenticity.David is supposed to be a first-rate android. That means he is at the height of the evolutionary chain at the start of Professor Hobby's expansion into the unknown science of love robots. Before he receives his ""board chip"", which puts a sort of finalization on his love schematics, he is completely a utilitarian robot designed for basic interaction. With the chip implanted, he becomes more lifelike and the mother likes him.Of course, as this is a fatalist film, something goes wrong. He shows incompetence to act as a normal human child and functions more as an alien life-form, putting the family he is assigned to in awkward positions and has the innate ability to harm. Inevitably, like Frankenstein, he is a freak. But not of nature, by manifestation of artificiality, which I believe to be one of the two main plots.Somewhere towards the end of the first act, his parents agree that he needs to ""thrown away"". That is where this movie completely fails in its first plot, which is to somehow say that AI has an emotional connection with humans. For starters, they don't present the motive for Professor Hobby creating loving machines besides curiosity. The parents that buy the first love child don't even explain why they want him besides longing for their son's return. So they buy this fake child to replace their sick son? There are some extreme morality issues that are flat-out ignored by humans in this film.I would have given it a 4 out of 10 if that was all to be seen here. Instead, it gets better. Soon after, David is thrown out with Teddy the android bear(who I actually had a personal connection with), into an android landfill. To make things worse, this place turns androids into Public Enemy #1. There are actual android hunters like the one played by the scummy character of Brendan Gleeson. Now the story just took a sharp right turn into Nature vs Artificiality, which can explain about 2/3 of the film.Man is trying to destroy artificiality before it consumes nature. It started with Greenhouse Gases. We saw what it did to New York City. It seems at this point in time there are alternate sources of energy for cars at least, as we seen people driving vehicles without exhaust pipes. We are continuously fooled into thinking there is going to be some co- harmony between AI and humans. But when Gigolo Joe says that humans are jealous of AI because they will outlive humans, we know where this film is going.Not too far ahead, we are reminded of this fantasy that is hope is nothing but a fairy tale in the form of the ""blue fairy"". It leads us back to Professor Hobby, who we find out created robots out of his own selfishness. He couldn't live with the fact that his boy was dead forever. So he created a hundred Davids. The mastermind of greed attempts and does not falter in trying to convince us that he created something wonderful. In truth, he has created unvalued commodities, numbers on an assembly line.Lo and behold it DOES go down to the deep pits of the underworld, after a ridiculous encounter with a mannequin blue fairy at the bottom of the ocean where Manhattan used to be. Here is the prime example where the first plot fails at epic proportions. Due to his limitation in programming, there is no distinction as to whether there is a loop in his memory board, or he is THAT desperate for love that he asks the blue fairy to make him a ""real boy"" for 2000 years in the depths of the ocean.Eventually the movie ends with one of the worst movie endings of all time, or quite a good ending if you think about it symbolically, which leaves out the human condition. It involves a world where artificiality has won over nature, in which it looks like almost everything is mechanical or cybernetic, whatever is not considered natural. There is no organic life left on Earth, humans are extinct also. Essentially they do a reverse effect, having the AI be the Creators of artificial humans to bring back David's ""mommy"".All-in-all a great fatalist piece, a terrible exploration into the ""why"" of creating AI humanoids, and a failure in making artificial life seem ""official"".

1284,ams13,Plan 9 with a bigger budget,1,1 June 2003,"I should preface my comments with a disclaimer: I think Stanley Kubrick is one of the most talented directors in the history of cinema--in a league with Renoir, Hitchcock, and Eisenstein. I wrote an undergraduate paper on __2001: A Space Odyssey__ and I am reading a friend's Ph.D. thesis on that film right now. It is possible, therefore, that my expectations for this film were inflated because of its touted connection with Kubrick. _A.I._, however, bears only the most casual mark of a Kubrick film (and then, only in the opening scenes). Instead of Kubrick's genius, we witness a truly bizarre blend of Steven Spielberg's shockingly obvious Oedipus complex and his equally shocking, un-ironic worship of Walt Disney films. I am not exaggerating. An important climax of the film hinges on the frankly oedipal question of whether a boy will get to climb in bed with his mother or not. Much of the story also involves a character's protracted hunt for the ""Blue Fairy,"" directly referencing Disney's version of _Pinocchio_ in a crude, ham-fisted way. Lest the pathology of this trainwreck attract viewers looking for camp-humor, I must caution the reader that while the film begins to resemble Ed Wood's __Plan 9 from Outer Space__ more and more as it rattles along, it does not do so in a good way. The budget for _A.I._ allows for slicker production values than Wood's film, of course, but the narrative structure is remarkably similar in its disjointedness. The most obvious parallel between the films, for example, occurs when an anonymous narrator breaks in to tell _A.I._'s audience a concocted story full of the most inane sort of Sci-fi cop-outs in order to excuse a further 30 minutes of obliquely related, mind-numbingly boring footage. I distinctly recall sitting in the theater, realizing that the voiceover narration sounded exactly like the alien ship captain in _Plan 9_ describing the silly, convoluted plot behind Wood's film. A number of critics have named _Plan 9 from Outer Space_ ""the worst movie of all time."" There is a certain exuberance and ingenuousness behind that film that redeems it, however, and so makes it enjoyable on a level the director may not have intended. There is virtually nothing redeeming about _A.I._, so, perhaps, it is the better candidate for the worst movie of all time.",A.I. Artificial Intelligence

Visual effects are nice, acting is OK, story is just stupid.  The basic premise is a robot boy that gets adopted.  Then he leaves.  Then we follow him around for the next 10,000 years.

1287,ramalho_85,One of the best movies in years,10,7 November 2003,"A.I is probably the most different movie you will ever see.It's almost three movies in one,and the blending is magnificent. As this was a project of Kubrick,It got exactly the same reviews that his films have at the beginning:very mixed reviews(at least in the english speaking countries)and praise in the European ones;and the box-office result was more similar to Kubrick than Spielberg-although it made probably more money than any of Kubrick films- I suppose as other great Sc-fi films like Blade Runner and 2001(they were even more panned)we have to wait at least 10 years for the official worldwide praise that it got in my country(It's considered to be one of the best sci-fi films of all time and one of Spielberg's best). Now,I know some of you will hate this film with a passion,but why?If you don't like the story You have to appreciate the direction(which is brilliant),if you don't then the acting(Which is amazing)if you still don't than what about cinematography,editing,special effects,make up,art direction,sound etc...It's impossible to completly hate the movie unless you have something personnal against It. The problem with this project Is that as It is a Spielberg movie It becomes more mainstream-too many ordinary people saw it(people who only generally like action)when it should be viewed by more independent based oriented genre viewers. As I end,I have to say that this is still one the most fascinating,passionate,beautiful movies ever made and you have to see It more than once to fully appreciate It.And in Europe it created a cult following-destined to become one of the greats of sci-fi sometime,somewhere in the future.How long It will take I do not Know.",A.I.

I have read those that say people don't like it because, its not the average Spielberg and its deep and thought provoking, I beg to differ.It starts off promisingly dark and atmospheric and ends as a cheesy Disney sci-fi flick. I think Kubrick was turning in his grave when this came out, I felt a mixture of nausea and hilarity at the ridiculous last 30 mins, what the hell happened, did they suddenly think... ""Oh dear the audience will be so confused and depressed if we leave it like that, we better do a third act and give it a voice over and explain everything in a patronising manner"" it was absolutely vomit inducing and totally insulted my intelligence.""Thought provoking""? errr perhaps for the younger audience who are still learning about love and hate, morality, prejudice, human rights, bigotry etc but for adults surely this was a walk in the park? If your wanting thought provoking I suggest you look a little deeper into more independent cinema that spends more time on the script and story line than flashy effects.Saying that, I thought Teddy was great, it was Oscar material he managed to portray a 50 year old man in the body of a 2ft cuddly toy - genius. ;o)",A.I.

It has everything that a good movie should have: an interesting plot, excellent acting (especially Haley Joel Osment) and beautiful music (thanks to J. Williams). I strongly recommend this film - even if you wouldn't like it, it will still make you think. The film is not really (or at least not only) a sad tale about a robot child but it presents a very pessimistic picture about the mankind in general and primarily about our lack of responsibility.**** possible spoilers **** I don't know how Kubrick would make this film, but Spielberg did one great thing: he chose Haley to play a robot. Haley is so convincing and moving that you do believe he is a robot. At one point of the story I believed that the Blue Fairy would indeed make him real.I agree that the film has some weak and illogical points (e.g. David under water - no one was looking for the stolen amphibicopter ?), but altogether the film is great and WELL WORTH WATCHING !!

1291,dictionary_head,Kubrik_speilberg venture is artifical,6,22 March 2004,"A.I Kubrik-Speilberg venture is Artificial. Cast: Haley Joel Osmont, Jude Law, Francis O'Conner, John Hurt. Rated: M Critics Warning: Some provoking and disturbing scenes. Critic's Rating: 6 1/2 out of 10 Why do Speilberg's films always feel the need to pose an important moral question? Why do they then address this with such a convoluted plot and soppy sentimentality that it makes me cringe? Why did Kubrik's estate let this chronically flawed movie off its feet? The questions asked by this movie certainly touch a raw ethical nerve. Can humans play `god'? Can A.I supercede humans as the ultimate practical, socially adaptable and emotionally sensitive being? But unlike its spiritual predecessor, Blade Runner, it does not have the flair or subtlety to rise above the choppy waters of the subject matter.The story revolves around David, a sort of space age Pinocchio in a world where global warming has drowned most coastal cities, where both resources and the natality rate are limited. A world of `mechas' and `orgas', nature and simulated nature struggling for survival. David is a prototype, created by the visionary professor Hobby to tap into a previously unexplored market a market for robots who can love. The first recipients of this new product are Monica and Henry, whose son is cryogenically suspended in comatose, beyond cure. Monica is at first repulsed by David but his sheer blissful innocence wins her over and she imprints her love on him. Then Martin is revived from his frozen state and the two vie for their mother's love. After Martin sickeningly exploits David to make him seem insane, Monica abandons David and his quest to become real and regain his mothers love, begins. It is a quest that will see him go to Flesh Fair (a place where robots are destroyed for entertainment and to show human supremacy.) to meeting Gigolo Joe, a pleasure `mecha'. From Dr No, the man who knows all (with over 1000 outlets statewide) to the end of their world, a half-submerged Manhattan.The cast performs with exemplary effectiveness, especially Jude Law as a charismatic, some how gentlemanly android sleaze. There are some great scenes in the movie, but they are always marred by some Speilbergian element that seems to be at ambivalence with the scene. For example the ending is very unpredictable, but a sappy voice-over makes it sound remarkably contrived. The feeling of contrast between both Kubrik and Speilberg's techniques is most grating here.  The music is also cloying, saturating the scene in its thick, syrupy folds. The cinematography is also quite soft and yielding at times. The art direction is lavish, ostentatious and sometimes awe-inspiring. But these formidable elements never seem to add to the sum of its parts. And also, although the movie tries to address the emotions that shape the mould of man the movie is slightly hollow, lacking in real feeling. Like so many of Speilberg's films and David, this movie is devoid of real soul.",A.I. Artificial Intelligence

1293,DJCYBORG83,This movie is frustrating beyond it's sappy ending or overwhelming bad sense of forced sentimentality.,1,22 May 2007,"This movie is frustrating for so many reasons.Spielberg and Kubrick were purportedly good buddies, but that should not have been a reason for Spielberg to think he could work off of Kubrick's pre-production without butchering it.I expected this movie to be so much more interesting and thought-provoking, and instead all I am left with is a ridiculous fairy-tale.The first twenty minutes or so of this movie show great-potential. The idea of inviting something like David into your home is chilling, and the problems that his programming begins to cause are handled well. Suddenly and without warning he's running through the woods with a talking teddy bear being chased by guys in a hot-air balloon that looks like the moon. It feels like a really bad rehash of elements found in E.T.The 'Flesh Fair' sequence is where things get really bad. Suddenly the cool futuristic design sense has been thrown out the window to make way for a 'spooky' carnival theme. It feels completely disjointed from the rest of the movie. I understand that it was intended to show human animosity and resentment towards the 'mecha'(what a stupid term to use), but there could have been so many better ways to do it instead of re-creating the droid torture scene from Return of the Jedi.The idea of using robots for sex is a great moral dilemma and I'm sure was one of Kubrick's ideas for the film. Again this could have been handled so much more intelligently, yet we're left with Jude Law as a tap-dancing cartoon character.At the end of the day, the biggest problem I have is that I couldn't care less about David or his convoluted Pinnochio-esquire quest. Sure it's really sad that he's so obsessed with Monica, but at the end of the day it's only his programming. I'm not sure why the movie kept trying to say that he actually 'loved' her, because from my point of view this simply wasn't so. He can reason to some extent, but his primary directive is not coming from any 'feeling' for her, simply a bonding that is hardwired in his system. To this extent, he may be one of the dumbest robots in movie history. The fact that he seems to be painfully unaware of his own existential dilemma, or simply won't acknowledge it, is perhaps the most annoying element of this film. The reason I feel that similar movies dealing with this topic such as Bladerunner and Ghost in the Shell are so successful is that the artificial protagonists are either painfully aware of their own existence or at least intelligently questioning it.My final gripe comes from the ending of the movie. I think the idea of highly evolved robots sifting through the frozen remains of human civilization is great. Why on earth would they suddenly turn into benevolent faeries who are in the business of granting wishes? This was clearly Spielberg's final attempt to suck some tears out of the audience . The only reason I would have to cry at the end of this movie is the loss of Stanley Kubrick and the loss of such a potentially great movie.",A.I. Artificial Intelligence

He goes from a potentially fulfilling situation to a lousy situation to horrible to almost certainly deadly to uncertain and then ends up pathetic. Swell. Why not give him a dose of 'mecha' Tuberculosis just for kicks??And then when he finally gets what he wants and needs, it's only for one day and then it's gone forever.

I only gave it 2 stars because of Jude Law, he was the only entertaining part of what was otherwise a long drawn out super boring disjointed mess.

For a film that has such powerful messages, great acting, and great production and costume design, I am stunned. My guess is that it's viewed as a lesser Spielberg film, and is overshadowed. Nonetheless, this film took me from curiosity, to despair, to wonderment, and to sadness. It encompasses a range of emotions as the A.I. goes on his journey in life and those emotions help you see his world in a way that transcends time. This film has cyberpunk, it has Metropolis-esque buildings, and most of all it has a robot that wants nothing else but to be loved.

The story deals with the journey of a small android boy that travels a path(very similar to Pinocchio's) who is looking for love(similarly to Bicentennial man). This movie revolves around questions, mostly the same questions asked in Bladerunner. Questions like, just because androids were created by humans, does that mean that their emotions are not real? And if they are not technically 'alive' do they still have a right to live? In the movie they answer few of the questions asked but not many, leaving it up to the viewer to think about them and answer them on their own. And indeed, finding the answers can prove quite thought provoking.Another plus is this movie has a very tangible feel to it. When watching this movie I was able to easily imagine this was the world in a couple centuries. I think the ending was a bit obvious and possibly unoriginal, but it did fit the storyline. Other than the ending, it's not hard to see why this movie won awards. The acting was quite good and Spielberg's had a tremendous eye for what he was doing, especially since a good portion of this movie was blue-screened.If you need there to be explosions to for you to sit through a sci-fi movie, this ain't for you. With plenty of well written dialogue and good special effects there's lots to look at, but no real tense action sequences.

Because at the heart of this movie is ultimately the story of David, a young mecha boy who just wants love and goes through a ton of struggles and a roller coaster journey to find acceptance. The emotional of this movie is further accentuated by both the weaving of real world social issues (i.e, prejudice, discrimination, acceptance, parent-child relationship, brief, loss, abandonment, etc.) next to the sci fi/futuristic atmosphere, style and setting but also the acting particularly by Haley Joel Osment who both made me smile and broke my heart as David. And now in retrospect this movie becomes even more heartbreaking for me when, after growing close to and rooting for David throughout his extremely long, intense journey to finally see mom again, I find out that David dies at the end of this movie.

1310,zelazbert2,The worst expensive movie ever made.,1,9 May 2006,"Most of what needs to be said about this movie has already been said by the previous nay sayers. I will add just a few things.At the time I saw _A.I._ (in the theater) I was taking an upper-division course on computers at my University, AND doing an in-depth presentation on artificial intelligence. (Just to show some credibility, I will add that one of the four questions on our final exam was about my report.) This movie got nearly everything wrong about its subject matter and title. I'm surprised Kubrick (or Spielberg) didn't do his research. The movie has little meaning without the premise holding up, and even as a morality tale it fails. Its bald allusions to _Pinocchio_ and _The Wizard of Oz_ come off as contrived and laughable, but the movie was so long and dreary that it doesn't work as a comedy.When my wife and I saw it, the theater had maybe 30 people in seats at the beginning. Halfway into the movie, there were less than a dozen people left. I felt embarrassed NOT leaving, but I couldn't help wanting to see this train wreck.I have a friend who is a film major that thinks that computer graphics have been the downfall of legitimate cinema. I think his view is extreme, but I would say that CGI cannot make a movie good, but it can help make it bad (e.g. the Star Wars prequels and A.I.)The only good qualities _A.I._ has are the acting and maybe the music and cinematography. These elements are vastly overshadowed by the tripe that is the rest of the film, though.",A.I. Artificial Intelligence
1311,aurinidmj,A poor example of science fiction,3,14 April 2009,"There are a lot of reasons for disliking this movie, but the one that stood out to me was it's poor understanding of themes which have been widely explored by various authors, and it's trite morality.Let's start from the beginning. The opening scene shows the directors of CyberCorp discussing the next step in Mecha - a robot which can love. In real world discussions of AI (as well as in many well written science fiction novels), there's been a lot of thought put as to what exactly AI means. Is the sex-bot in the opening scene self aware? Obviously it's capable of abstract thought (love making takes planning, after all, as well as subtle judgements of one's partner), but is it capable of learning? Video game makers have already developed AIs that can adapt to the player's strategy, but they're not capable of innovating; of creating strategies that the makers didn't originally intend.So, for argument's sake, the sex bot has complex mechanisms for executing language, analyzing human emotion, and adapting to her partner - but not the more abstract ability to innovate or to self-reflect. The next step, then, would be to build a robot with an imagination... oh wait, we just want a robot that will love? Well, define love for me? Is it really that hard to program, if you already have the sex-bot program? Don't get me wrong, like any other human being love is one of my primary driving behaviours - but at the end of the day, isn't it just a fixation on one person combined with a positive-feedback loop? It's hardly a major challenge to AI writers, and if Michael Chrighton can be believed, they'd already developed it back in the 70s (re: Terminal Man). Heck, I've played Civ 4, and if you play your cards right, you can get some of the other AIs in that game to 'love' you.You know... taking what I just wrote into consideration, maybe David's dialogue was pretty realistic, after all...Now, do you see what I just did there? I wrote an interesting, plausible, and easily-understandable piece on the development of AI. Instead of the Star Trek techno-babble about 'mapping neurons,' the CEO at the beginning of the movie could have said something like this; framed the moral question for the rest of the movie. But of course A.I. didn't do this, because it's *not really science fiction!* A couple of other points, that I won't belabour too heavily, but need to point out: how smart was Teddy? If you were building an intelligent toy for small children, would you give it full reasoning ability, or would you just give it a simple 'comfort' algorithm? Free thought and independent thinking could make the thing dangerous; Keep It Simple, Stupid. Second of all, why do all the humans act as if they've never seen any of the apocryphal literature about Robot Wars? What is this, a zombie flick? A remake of Karel Čapek's R.U.R. (Rossum's Universal Robots) would have been more relevant. Even though he wrote it in 1921, it was more forward thinking (let alone original) than this movie was. A.I. was is not science fiction, it's just a fairy tale - and a very poorly plotted, disjointed, and morally ambiguous one at that. As another reviewer here pointed out, Pinochio sought self improvement to earn his way into being a real boy; David never seeks to improve, and just wants a magic pill.One final point - if the Mecha are generally considered 'sub-human', and behave in predictable algorithms which deny any sympathy, then torturing them would be about as much fun as holding a fan blade still so that it makes a clicking noise. So why is humanity so vicious in their persecution? This was just another stupid Hollywood movie for stupid people who like to put on airs of intelligence.",A.I. Artificial Intelligence

Quantity of emotion and performance by young Osment is fantatsic and I can't still believe that child of his age can show this mixture of emotion throughout the movie. Fantastic special effects, not used like a separate category, but like a appendix to the fantastic story. Kubrick can be pleased with this one and for the Spielberg it's one of his best movies, maybe the best one.

1316,marshall-9,Be prepared to think (for a change),10,16 July 2001,"The power of this film can be seen in the reviews. All of them, on site and off. Like the movie itself, no one is able to wrap this thing into a tidy package and deliver it. I remember when 2001 came out. A couple reviews I read then I still have-- one by Roger Ebert and one from the Christian Science Monitor, of all places. Combined, they lined up the symbols, references, and intentions to lead to a logical conclusion in a manner that seemed wondrous to me (in high school) at the time. I began to learn that there is more to watching a movie than watching a movie.
So, here's A.I. What a leap. In 2001 we went beyond Jupiter and asked What's going on here? And we were told that, like the astronaut, we were not permitted to understand because such an experience MUST be beyond our understanding. This new film generates more questions and wonder with each passing day. The code is not subtle like it was in 2001. It's wired right into our own experience. We know the fairy tale (or the way it was told to us) and we know childhood (or the way it was supposed to be) and we've heard about love and how it will save the world. The key to the puzzle is itself a scrambled code.I walked out of this movie contemplating it's ""flaws,"" and since then the flaws all keep churning up to more amazement at the richness of the film and its ideas.

And then bam, here comes the ending, I could not have thought of anything worse, my dog could not thought of a worse ending for the movie.  Haley Joel obviously gives a great performance, however his performance along with everyone else's is completely ruined by the last hour of the movie.  I turned to my friends not once, not twice, but thrice, or even 10 or 15 times 2 hours and 10 minutes in and asked if we could leave.  It seems that someone out there in hollywood wanted that kind of ending so that some of the pg audience would like the movie i guess because it was ""cool"".  Seriously, do not watch this movie unless u want to be bored out of your mind at the end.

1320,rabbl,Speilberg does a bad Kubrick impression,1,8 July 2001,"On the surface, the movie is just plain too long.  When you start thinking about, however, exactly what scenes you would leave out to make it shorter (and the list ends up including over 2/3rds of the movie), you realize that there was a lot more amiss with A.I.  Spielberg's attempt at a tribute to Kubrick's style actually ends up being nothing but a reflection of his own. The essence of Kubrick's art was creating a very deliberate flow such that every scene flows evenly, no mini-climax, just building the emotions in the viewer scene by scene, until they match that of the main characters - then, when you think you just can't stand the inner angst, the fear, or the suspense any longer, you are presented with resolution, but never quite as satisfying or complete an answer as you wanted.Spielberg substituted mere length for this masterful storytelling; there was a climax to every scene, side plots all over, too many distractions from the main character, all leaving the viewer mostly numb.  By the end, there was only releif; no empathy for the boy, no bittersweet tears.  There wasn't a 'wet' eye in the house!The one bright spot - as always - Jude Law.  Unfortunately, he steals the scene, and the attention away from the story line, all too easily.If you insist on seeing this, make it a rental - you will need the pause button to get through this 2 1/2 hour marathon!",A.I.

They refer to David as the only remaining link to *living* beings, he is essentially their ancestor, one who knew and lived with their creators, which is why he is dealt so much respect and pandered to during the final scenes.  The ending was a refreshing coda to a great sci-fi film. Although it would have been quite satisfying to have left David at the bottom of the sea, I very much liked the way we got to see how man's technology outlives and outgrows him.

1323,terrence michael,A Film of Genius and Heartbreak,10,20 August 2001,"I was talked into seeing it a second time.  I'm glad now.  It was the only way to appreciate Spielberg's genius and to realize this may have been one of the greatest films ever made.But I was not at all moved to see it again when I first left the theater. Some weeks before, the reason I attended a screening for the first time was -- shame on me -- a reaction to the hype.  I was motivated more by the glitter of names (Kubrick and Spielberg, Haley Joel Osment) than by a reasonable expectation of the artistic merits.  I came away from the theater with a mixture of confusion and disappointment; there'd been no ""Close Encounters"" awe, no ""Raiders"" excitement, and the message Spielberg (and his mentor and guide Kubrick) imparted was of such profound complexity that it made my brain hurt.  I wasn't in the mood that night for thinking too hard. I was expecting ""E.T. meets A Clockwork Orange,"" and what Spielberg gave us was something entirely different (though with some reference to past works). So I walked away from the theater and thought, ""What a letdown.""I was wrong.  I was *so* wrong after seeing this film a second time that I was moved to write to this user comments board.  Someone whose opinion I respect convinced me to go back to the theater for ""a second look.""  I balked, then finally relented, and I was stunned by my lack of understanding and appreciation the first time around.  This film is beautiful, haunting, deeply moving and, at the end, ultimately heartbreaking.Spielberg takes us by the hand and invites us to look at some excrutiatingly painful issues, as searing as an ember to the heart.  He does not do this out of his own amusement; he does it because he is aware of the pace our technology is taking us.  He knows that given the rapidity with which computers are growing in abilities, it is only a matter of time that computers will one day be indistinguishable from humans.  In answer to the question, ""When will you know when talking to a computer whether it has become the equal of a human,"" the reply from, I believe, Ray Bradbury was, ""When you can't tell the difference.""  It may be another century, but I believe a boy-robot David will be manufacturable.Which leads to the most painful issue of all, and which was raised by a character in the film itself:  If we can program a computer to love us, what responsibility does that place upon we humans, who have created it, to the computer?  Is love within our human brains simply a matter of an arrangement of chemicals, much as the software we would implant into a boy-robot's computer brain?  Is there a difference?  If David can love, if he can feel emotion and think in the abstract, does he have a soul?  Do we then treat him as a human?  Should we then allow ourselves to love him back, without a second thought, the way we would love a person?Each moviegoer must arrive at his or her own conclusion, and it is my firm belief that no one will arrive at an answer which will satisfy.  That may be the film's greatest undoing as a commercial product, because of the dissatisfaction of the audience in not having a neatly wrapped ending or pat answers.  Word of mouth is powerful, and no doubt the word has already gone out about ""A.I."": no neatly wrapped ending, no satisfactory answers. Regrettably, that has translated into lower ticket sales for an astoundingly well-made film.And what were *my* conclusions about David and his programmed love?  I mentioned earlier that the film was ultimately heartbreaking.  [CAUTION: SPOILER FOLLOWS]  When David is faced at the very end of the film with only a day-long revisit with his long-dead mother, who in truth is only a DNA-fabricated clone, he knows -- and we know -- that his happiness will be only momentary, and that for the rest of his existence, which may literally be eternal, he will be alone.  His only escape from loneliness will be to journey, as the voice-over said, to the place ""where dreams are born."" But a dream, or a memory, is no substitute for a mother's actual loving hug. *My* conclusions?  David should never have been created in the first place. It is the ultimate in human hubris to create a machine to love us when we know it will only be denied happiness at the end of human life and for eternity.  Spielberg's message, loudly and clearly, is this:  Beware of what you wish for through technology, for you may surely have it.  And it may be a grievous sin upon the innocent.",A.I.

A promising first act centers on the potential for a life-like robotic boy replacing a human emotionally rather than mechanically. Plot, such as there is, soon veers off into fairy tales (pinnochio, wizard of oz) and finally screeches to a halt with a ""waterworld"" meets ""close encounters"" ending that drags on for at least a half hour longer than it should, culminating in a painfully saccharine ending. On the plus side, Jude Law is excellent, the cinematography and especially the intricate CGI are stellar, and the brief middle section which adroitly deals with racism, in the form of a demolition derby of used and abused robots is quite creative. On the minus side, incredibly slow pacing interrupted by moments of psychotic behaviour by the robot-boy, annoying psudo-narration, truly unlikeable characters (Are we really supposed to like ""david""?) and Mack truck sized plot holes (The father taking home a unique prototype from work and having his wife sign for it later? The company never checking on the prototype? The most blatent and telling being after William Hurt has finally reunited with ""david"" HE LEAVES HIM ALONE to gather other people. I guess they don't have pagers or phones in the robotic future. ) I wont even go into the translucent aliens who can reincarnate the dead ""for one day only"" By then I was just counting the minutes until the torture ended. The film offers many intriging questions, then ignores them, such as the future is bleak as water levels have risen hundreds of feet and government dictates human reproduction to conserve limited resources.

1328,bkalel333,"Fascinating, Beautiful, but loses direction",9,29 June 2001,"What is the perfect marriage between the definition of theatrical coldness and intelligent, masterful detachment (Kubrick) and warm, emotional cinema (Spielberg), A.I. is a fascinating and intriguing film. The cinematography is beautiful, the score  strangely modern and low-key for a Williams, and the acting is superb.It raises questions of human nature -- in fact, the definition of ""human"" -- but at the same time never makes a conclusion of it's own, at least, not a definitive one. Roger Ebert was one the right track when he commented on the fact that the film would have better emotional moments and more investigation into the topic of how humanoid something can be before it is considered human if it were to discuss the trauma of separation at the family's end rather than David, the android (or ""mecca"") boy.The film has some very remarkable and believable sequences about the future of our society, especially the ""Flesh Fair"" -- a horrifying and disturbingly real sequence.While the last third of the film, or even less -- from the point where he finds what he's looking for on -- rings slightly false and seems to avoid the questions that it has proposed while at the same time trying to answer them, it is fulfilling emotionally nonetheless.While the ending is suitable considering the fact that it is science fiction, it could have done to use less dialogue. And the paradox that I construed in the ending --- that I won't give away --- I think was intentional, not a mistake in film making. In fact, maybe all the paradoxes about human vs. artificial life that were made (see Ebert's review for better, more analytical discussion) were intentional.At any rate, the film is thoroughly worth seeing, for the beautiful and imaginative imagery and for the discussions it'll spark after some thoughts about the themes.Despite some flaws, it is a masterful, enjoyable, and thought-provoking movie.",A.I.

Either you haven't seen it and are trying to decide if you should, or you have seen it and want to see what other people think about it.If you haven't seen it, I'd say, ""Do.""  While this film did have some weaker points, it is overall a very noble effort.  This movie is not entirely a happy-go-lucky movie.  There were parts that quite literally left me with a chilled feeling.  But suffice it to say that you will not leave the theater feeling empty and depressed.  I won't say you'll like it; I won't say you won't.  But if you're seeking advice, then I say go see it.If you like Haley Joel Osment, as I do, then *definitely* go see it.  I think that Haley Joel Osment is one of the better actors around right now, and in this movie, he does an excellent job of being a human portraying a robot who's trying to act human.  He is one of a very short list of famous people I would thoroughly enjoy meeting in real life.  [Ergo, if you can arrange it, I would be eternally grateful ;-)]For those who have seen the movie, here's what I think.  *SPOILER ALERT BELOW*  Overall, the movie was a success.  As I said earlier, though, it did have its weak points.  For instance, the tension between Monica and David might have been much better, and more realistic, if it was stronger.  There were only a few brief incidents, and then suddenly Monica decides she is tired of David and gets rid of him.  Not realistic.  Also, I thought that the ending was rather odd.  I can't personally think of a better way to end it, but everything after Manhattan had a somewhat surrealistic feel to it, to me.  Not to say I disapprove of the way it was ended.  In fact, I particularly enjoyed that chilled feeling I got as I watched David sit at the bottom of the sea, entombed by the Ferris wheel, as the voice explained how he would sit there for 2000 years.  I enjoyed the chilled feeling, but I'm very glad the movie didn't end right there.  However, these are only the movie's shortcomings.  The rest of the movie was, in my opinion, extremely well done and enjoyable.  The technical aspects were all correct; the emotions were, overall, well portrayed; and the plot was enjoyable and somewhat unpredictable--a welcome change.  David's interactions with the other boys, including Martin, were very real.  Overall, I liked this movie, and wouldn't mind seeing it a second time.",A.I. Artificial Intelligence

Spielberg teases us with hints of intrigue, the promise of complex issues to be tackled.  instead, he bails out and lands in a soft bed of pathos. He tries to draw tears by taking us down roads that need not be traveled.  He brings up issues that need not be covered, such as Rouge City, the Flesh Fair, and the ""out of nowhere"" final 20 minutes.  Could the story really have not been told without these elements?  Did he really need to disrupt the mood and feel of the picture with neon dirt-bikers?Spielberg reminded us occasionally that Stanley Kubrick originally was to helm this picture, specifically with the pre-imprinted behavior of David, and the Manhattan sequence.

A.I. is cinematically beautiful, and tells a wrenching emotional story of a child's quest for maternal love.In A.I., Spielberg masterfully adopts Kubrick's hard, bare-essentials style of direction, letting the photography tell the story, rather than the dialogue. This style allowed Kubrick to develop an enormous scope of ideas, stories and emotions in his movies. But it often left casual movie goers behind.  He had difficulty finding the right treatment for A.I. so he handed the project to Spielberg before Kubrick's death last year.Spielberg textures A.I. with obvious dollops of his own soft-as-whipped-cream touch.  It is Spielberg's great skill that blends the two styles together with mesmerizing results.  This blend allows the emotional story of a young robotic boy to come to life, and Kubrick fans will be able to enjoy one last film made by the master -- with the respectful help of another great artist.The Kubrickian style demands the very best from actors, who must appear unapologetically real, and must, in long sequences with no dialogue, convey strong feelings and emotions. The A.I cast, especially lead actor Haley Joel Osment, meet every measure of the demands. Despite his youth, Osment will surely receive a nomination for Best Actor.A.I. will rank high among the best movies ever made, but viewers should come prepared for an intense emotional and intellectual work-out.

1343,skinnyboy,I can't believe people liked it,1,5 September 2001,"If you haven't seen this movie, be grateful.  *spoilers ahead*First, the good parts.  In the first half of the film, Osment plays the role of robot incredibly well.  Ok.  That's it.Overall, the first half of the film is bad.  The second half, however, is completely unbearable.  There were two or three places where the film could have ended and made as much sense as it did ultimately, but instead it dragged on for ages.  Other reviews mention A.I. as being a great work by Kubrick or Spielberg.  I wonder, if their names had not been associated with this movie, would people claim to like it just as much?  Having to listen to a 13-year old squeal ""Mommy"" over and over just doesn't appeal to me.A.I. had so many flaws that I can barely think of a place to begin. Somehow, water does absolutely no damage to the robot, but spinach does? Cold temperatures affect it as well?  The other physical problems were insane: The helicopter can submerge to those depths?  The ferris wheel falling on it doesn't crush it?  Statues and their painted surfaces remain perfectly intact after being submerged and encased in ice for thousands of years?  The buildings in Manhattan (and don't even get me started on the explanation of the city's name) are still standing after all that time?  My personal favorite is the school of fish being able to swim the submerged robot back to the surface.The flaws in reasoning are just as bad.  Monica can't bring herself to have David dismantled (since we apparently cannot simply turn him off or erase any stored data), so instead she dumps him in the middle of the woods in a state of complete despair?  Yeah, that'll be better for him!  Technology has advanced to the point where robots can be made to perfectly resemble humans, think, and even love, but they have no common sense.  Hmm... not everything you read is real?  Isn't that a lesson that every 13-year old (even if he does only have 7 candles on a birthday cake) would know?  So once the short ice age comes and goes, we need to create Monica once again.  Since she'll be dead in a day, because... well... she just will, why bother with a DNA sample?  I'm sure a realistic version of her could have been created. Squeals of ""Mommy"" could have been heard for years to come.  And why does she never once question the sudden disappearance of her son and husband? Finally, the whole ""Teddy-saves-the-hair"" bit went beyond the realm of possibility for everyone.I know, I know.  I missed it.  I didn't understand it.  It was too deep for my mind.  Disneyesque voice-overs automatically make a movie deep, I know. As far as I'm concerned, the only thing deep about A.I. was the non-stop crap on the screen.",A.I. Artificial Intelligence
1344,crombie000,Spielberg Displays Just What Kubrick Would Have Wanted,10,30 June 2001,"Walking out of the theater, I wasn't exactly sure how to feel. This was definitely not Spielberg's forte, classical cinema. This was very different. Thinking more about Kubrick, I evaluated the movie. Spielberg does a wonderful job of replicating the essence of Kubrick, however it doesn't naturally flow from him. A.I. looks like Spielberg looking like Kubrick, which is fine, Spielberg made a beautiful film, however it's noticeable Kubrick was replicated. I don't want to confuse anyone by this. A.I. was fantastic, and my admiration of Spielberg increases each time I think of this movie. There is so much about it that is fantastic, the acting, the style, and the cinematography are superb. If I had gone into the theater not knowing Kubrick had a hand in this, I wouldn't have thought twice about it. That is what I'm trying to get to. Because we know Kubrick was a part of this, it seems as though Spielberg had a stencil he had to use (which he uses and individually, creatively modifies perfectly). I will not discuss the ending, however, I will tell you Kubrick had the story down pat, until the end. Once its time came, he had no idea what to do next. I feel Spielberg could have thought of something stronger and a little more meaningful. The ending doesn't have as strong a punch as the rest of the movie. Frances O'Connor...I think someone older, more mature could have used the same ending, only perfected it, making it have much stronger a punch than the rest of the movie. O'Connor (in the end) was...weak? (very strong word, but accurate). Her performance was decent for the rest of the movie however, and whatever it is she lacks, Osment makes up for unbelievably. Overall, I give it a ten. Audacious, yes, Looks like Kubrick, yes (only because Spielberg had an obligation to surrender some of his originality), not Spielberg's best, yes, but definitely an excellent movie.",A.I.

Everyone, however, will know that they witnessed a movie that is, at the very least, more ambitious than the usual summer eye-candy.Stanley Kubrick originally intended to make the film, basing it on a short story called ""Supertoys Last All Summer Long.""  Steven Spielberg took over the project, with the blessing of both Kubrick and his family.  Shades of Kubrick are present throughout the film, particularly in the questions that lie at the heart of the movie: What exactly makes us human?  If a robot is created to experience emotions such as love, pain and fear, should it be treated as if it is something subhuman?  Is it morally wrong to do that, or do we have no moral obligations to ""artificial"" creations?Obviously, there are no easy answers to these questions.  While the film approaches these issues with careful thought and reasoning, Spielberg's influence emerges and the film drifts toward sentimentality.  This is most evident during the finale, which tugs at the heartstrings but only evokes artificial emotions.  I even wonder if Spielberg used sentimentality on purpose, to make us realize that our emotions can be controlled, just as a robot's emotions can be programmed.  Probably not.Whenever he brings the film off-course, however, Spielberg makes up for it by giving us amazing visuals, and truly magical scenes that left me watching with wide eyes.  That, combined with his masterful storytelling, make for a visceral movie that is certainly worth the price of admission.  And, despite its shortcomings, the movie wrestles with difficult philosophical questions that will be on everyone's mind as they leave the theater.  It is a truly satisfying movie experience.",A.I.

Though others have discussed them being highly evolved machines by then end of the film I really couldn't have cared less.However, the rest of the film and HJO and Jude Law were excellent. Good ideas and very well examined.As said elsewhere, Teddy was wonderful.After seeing the skyline of Manhattan under water, and the effect that had on the audience for obvious reasons, the last act brought fits of laughter from the audience.

1351,dylan_cuthbert,More than meets the eye,10,24 June 2001,"I was lucky enough to see an late-night preview of this film here in Tokyo, so here are my thoughts and comments: (don't worry, NO SPOILERS)This is one of those odd films that has you filled with a squiggly warm feeling at one point, and squirming awkwardly at another.  Whilst experiencing those two see-sawing emotions, the viewer will be gazing at awe at the technical prowess of the Spielberg team as they bring to life probably one of the most realistic ""near-future"" environments seen-to-date.Its not all good however.  To begin with, there is too much ""explanation"" of events - I could feel Kubrick turning in his grave at some points where the monologue sounded tuned for the eager 8 year-olds in the audience.  Also, the entire ""epilogue"" should be half the length it is and re-written (sic) to avoid all the unnecessary dialogue.  Additionally, the initial third of the movie should probably be longer, and *colder*; I felt some of the scenes were chopped in and it felt a little like the audience was being rushed through in order to get to the juicy bits later. (the original kubrick script had the mother become alcoholic to deal with the stress of bringing up a robot, this might have been a better route and would have portrayed the mother in a colder light which I think would have been cleaner)Its not all bad however.  If you sit back and tune out parts of the dialogue you will get treated with quite an intriguing Kubrick-like movie.Interestingly enough, I feel Spielberg *did* manage to distance himself from himself (until the epilogue) - do *not* watch the first third of the movie as if it is E.T. because you *will* feel Kubrick's icy fingers on your neck at certain points and it will shock you.Another note, this isn't really a kids' movie as there are some truly subliminally scary scenes in the story.  Its an adult movie in kid's clothing...Finally, the music score is one of the best I've heard in a Spielberg movie since Close Encounters.  There are some obvious (and obligatory in my opinion) references to Kubrick's masterpiece of a soundtrack ""2001"" and just the music alone gives some scenes that ""tingling on your back"" sensation.For all its niggly points, I'll definitely be going to see it again.",A.I.

I am always a big fan of Steven Spielberg, yet this time I am kind of being turned off, it might be because I expected too much.  However, I still think it could be a masterpiece if they ended the movie at the right place and right time, if they got rid of the narrator, if they cut off those unnecessary explanations, if they.....

Unlike all 27 parts of Star Wars and the 10 new Hobbit movies, it's not some ""good over evil"" drivel. The message here is about the failures of both blind faith and technology.I feel bad that you sci-fi geeks had to sit thru something that offered a li'l warmth and truth and didn't offer enough costumes for you to wear to your future conventions.  I also feel bad for you Kubrik fans that didn't get something completely deep, dark, and jaded, but in my opinion at least, you did get some reality.  And coming from Speilberg's saccherine touch, not many would have expected that!As for the story, Robokid spends the last half of the movie looking for the Blue Fairy, on a quest for a miracle.  He finds this Blue Fairy and waits, and waits, and waits.  Much in the same way that many of our oppiated masses  wait, and wait, and wait, at our churches, synagogues, mosques, and what have you.  But self-created, imaginary gods, have no miracles.Technology on the other hand, can come close to offering a miracle, as seen with the robo-aliens, but in the end, it too falls short.In the end, the dead (Robokid's mom) stay dead and the never living (Robokid) stay never living . Only MEMORIES can change this!When Robokid awakens, he will know that thru the memories of his mom, she will, in part, live on.  Thanks to these same memories which he holds dear (and no thanks to anything the robo-aliens could possibly do, nor anything that the Blue Fairy did) he too, despite never getting the blood, tissues, muscles and organs that he yearns for, will, in part, be human.  The last of the humans at that.So save all the technical flaws, bloops, and blunders about DNA, or ice ages, or anything else for the ""Goofs"" section of IMDb and try to appreciate the simple message in this FANTASY.

Go watch it again and then think about it awhile, there is a lot there and most of it is fairly subtle. It fairly a fairly hefty commentary on the human experience from a lot of different angles. Pretty much every way it is possible to be human is explored by some character in the movie. Simplistic themes like good and evil, sure. Prejudice, sure. Love, sure. But also ask yourself some questions like,Why was David's character written without a conscious? While he has love, he has no moral compass. He's sympathetic, he's childlike, but even a 10 year-old has a basic understanding of right and wrong. David does not. He really is a danger to his parents and sibling, but doesn't understand that (while his approximately same aged brother does and uses it to his advantage).Why did Gigolo Joe think he had committed a crime? Clearly he has some kind of sense of right and wrong. Having a digital brain, one would think he would be able to provide ironclad exculpatory evidence and even direct knowledge of the real murderer. Why run?Why did they man at the Flesh Fair throw the stone? Why did the AI at the end feel it was important to make David happy? Further, why did the feel it was important to bring back his real mother, and not just provide him with a simulation which would have made him happier and lasted longer. Was it for her benefit more than his?Dunno. I saw the movie and pondered a lot of questions like this for days. The story was clearly written a specific way, with specific symbology and specific dialog. Not a word is wasted.

Poor Steven Spielberg. He misjudged the ability of an audience to actually THINK during a film and not just eat popcorn and stare at the pretty lights.This film is not a serious discussion of the use of Artificial Intelligence. This film is not a standard science fiction story. This film is a fable or fairytale in the same mould as Pinocchio with similar themes and issues. It is MEANT to be fantastical. It is MEANT to be ambivalent. It is MEANT to challenge your preconceptions.If I see another reviewer use the words 'typical Spielberg schmalz' I think I'll scream. There is a reason Kubrick wanted Spielberg to direct this film. His inate ability to convey emotions on screen made him perfect for this material - Kubrick simply couldn't have done it and he was all too aware of this fact.So what about that ending? At first I too thought 'what on earth is going on?', but I knew that there must have been some sort of significance to it all. I think it will surprise many to discover that it is actually closer to Kubricks original plan than any other part of the film. Sentimental? On the surface, perhaps. But look beneath that veneer and you will find an endingthat is more disturbing, ambivalent, deep and intrigueing than you could possibly imagine. Why does Spielberg use a different film stock for the ending? Why does it coincide with the first moment David closes his eyes? Why does the sun suddenly rise behind David? Is this real? Is David dreaming? Is it truly a happy ending?When you think of it in this way does the ending remind you more of Spielberg or of Kubrick? For me it is classic Kubrick, similar in style and outcome to 2001: A SPACE ODYSSEY - ambiguous, hopeful, different, challenging.

This movie is at its best when it's closely following the short story it's based on, but then it veers wildly away from human drama into violent allegory. It was never clear what story was being told, and the movie suffered from not knowing when to start (the whole first scene of Star Trek-style technobabble could have easily been eliminated), and certainly not knowing when to end. The last twenty minutes were painfully bad, and seemed tacked on in order to give the story a ""happy"" ending. Haley Joel Osment, and Jude Law, gave very good performances, however, and were the high points of the movie.",A.I. Artificial Intelligence
1374,RRach87,Bad Ending,3,10 July 2001,"A movie that could have been a sci-fi classic of epic proportions is lost in an overly long ending that just doesn't work . For the better half of this movie, we are presented with a thought provoking story about the future, android robots, their place in society, and our ability to relate and to love these ""mecha"" beings. There are many deep insightful issues raised here, but the path chosen to end this movie leaves these issues unresolved. Instead the filmmaker unsuccesfully tries to bring to life a fairy tale tied closely to the tale of Pinochio (""make me a real boy""). Spielberg tries desperatley to make a movie in the mold of Stanley Kupbrick rather than being true to his own movie making style. Still... it may be an important piece of filmmaking, and it may be worth seeing for the beauty and the intelligent story that is the basis of most of this film. I wish they would pull this movie off the shelf and rework the last 45 minutes. It ended 8 times too many, and dragged on until I began to wish the credits would begin to roll.",A.I.

1375,MurdockSC,Underly Overdone.. yet masterful..,8,2 July 2001,"Overall, the more you think about this film the more it reflects another facet back into your face. It is a diamond in the rough, it will not be cleaned for years ( and even then it will be flawed or dirtied in the process or 1000's of muddied minds like my own) The execution at times was drawn out. I agree with many comments regarding the protracted ending. They could have let the boy rust staring at the blue fairy and it would have worked just fine.. if not better.If they had made a little more clues about the final ""world"" we end up in there may be more appreciation of its role in the film.If used, it could have constricted and done in a much more poignant fashion. [though the heck if kubrick would have done it that way , or shall i bite my tongue in looking back at strangelove it its tactics]I could go on and on and segment the film and analyze, but it is beyond a user comment. You don't want to hear my or others babbling about.In view of that: it is wonderful, could have been better in parts. (of course we can easily say that of any film, especially one that is 15 years in the works by kubrick and 4 writers later).Worth seeing : please though , I do not think this is for children. Late teens and older perhaps.",A.I. Artificial Intelligence
1376,Cases83,Very disappointed!,1,6 July 2001,This film was a major disappointment. It was very predictable and at times very long. The characters were shallow and one dimensional.

1377,Kurt1960,Destined to become a classic!,10,8 July 2001,"This film is a masterpiece, borne of the collaboration of two of film directors' masters -- Stanley Kubrick and Steven Spielberg. Steven Spielberg has been my favorite director since before he scared the daylights out of me as a young teenager with Jaws. Stanley Kubrick's films have been at the top of my list as well.I'm not going to give any spoilers here. This is a movie everyone must see for themselves. One suggestion: See this movie with an open mind. Don't sit down and think you're about to see a typical Spielberg film, or a Kubrick film that someone else finished for him. It is both, and neither.
The acting in this film was beyond splendid. Special mention must be made here for young Haley Joel Osment. I fully expect him to not only be nominated for an Academy Award but I will have serious doubts about the system if he is not given the Oscar for his performance.

1379,trhamilton,Good but I expected a little better.,8,29 June 2001,When I saw the movie I was slightly disappointed.  The boy was supposed to be very realistic but for some reason the teddy bear (had AI too so it's not an insult) seemed more human than the boy did.  The movie had very interesting points but just seemed to rush through them as if they were nothing.  They have them saying the humans hated them explained why and never touched it again.  The ending was a bit of a stretch (won't say what but you will probably see it to). The sound track was good although John Williams has definatly done better.  Special effects were great and hard to spot (this is coming from a 3D animator).  I will say it is definatly original it may have been done before in Bicentenial Man but the way it unfolds is new and like no other movie.  It is not a long movie but it is one of those movies that feel way longer than it really is.,A.I. Artificial Intelligence

If you enjoy thought provoking films, a la Stanley Kubrick, see it.  I thoroughly enjoyed the movie but was offended by the 'narration' at the end.

Haley Joel Osment wonderfully played a robot who can never live fully in the human world and is alone in the mecha world.Jude Law was great as a lovable ladies' man.  But the scene-stealer had to be the Teddy Bear.  I hope they come out with this as a toy to buy. Spielberg and Kubrick are geniuses in their own ways.",A.I. Artificial Intelligence

1383,mykeyboard,"Entertaining, odd, bold, beautiful",8,29 June 2001,"A.I. struck me as a film that was a combination of almost all of Kubrick's films, Spielberg's films and Blade Runner.  With stunning visuals and flawless acting this movie is sure to impress anyone.  However, on the more philosophical level, this movie will raise many more questions than it answers.  What is love? Can love be defined/given/taken?  Also, it digs deep into the raw emotions of humans and their desires.  I congratulate both directors and writers for pushing the envelope and creating a movie that tests the minds of the audience.However, I am thoroughly disapointed with the ending.  It seems that once again Spielberg has decided to throw in another ending that tries to tie things up more completely.  Throughout the movie it is quite evident when it is Spielberg directing and when it is Kubrick and the end is without a dought all Spielberg.  I won't spoil any of the plot for you dont' worry I'll just say that at times in this movie I found myself stepping back and saying ""woah how'd they do that""  and ""that's a great effect""  These and the numerous cameos were all the detracted from an extroadinarily visual epic of a living robot boy.",A.I.

1384,Guineve126,One of the worst movies ever made (WARNING: SPOILERS),1,6 July 2001,"This comment is difficult to make, as I've admired some of Spielberg's past movies.  But this movie...this movie is TERRIBLE!  First of all, I've never seen so many excellent camera angles...that were ripped off of another director, i.e. Stanley Kubrick.  The bathroom scene was a blatant example (plus the fact that Gigolo Joe looks -- and dances -- a great deal like Alex from ""A Clockwork Orange"").  The tones of the movie shifted too rapidly. It went in between Kubrick's icy intelligence to Spielberg's emotions like a crazy sine wave.  There is no one in the movie to identify with, or to root for.  David's parents are despicable, Gigolo Joe wasn't on screen long enough, every ""orga"" human child is a spoiled brat, and David himself is creepy.  The only good character was Teddy!  Plus, for a movie that's supposed to be original, why did it rip off both ""The Wizard of Oz"" and ""Pinnochio""...especially when there is no way David could ever turn into a real boy?  Finally, I've never seen a movie with such a tacked on ending. Honestly!  It's ridiculous to have aliens that are obviously more advanced than human beings philosophizing about the extinct human beings' ""spirit"" and ""genius.""  To top it all off, the score is completely wrong for this movie.  I'm sorry Mr. Spielberg, but your attempts at wrenching my heart strings have failed.  You did, however, make me feel extremely sick at heart.",A.I. Artificial Intelligence
1385,LoonChild,Second worst film I've ever seen,1,29 September 2001,"The basic premise of this film is the question of whether a robot can be made to love, but I couldn't believe the human characters were capable of love, so worrying about the robot was superfluous. This was essentially a string of very pretty scenes which didn't follow from each other, and didn't really have anything to say.  It starts off dull, then moves to mindless action, and ends up with the most absurd ending in cinematic history.",A.I. Artificial Intelligence
1386,mirandalee,Misunderstood Masterpiece,10,7 July 2001,"Since I saw this movie last week I have actively been reading the comments posted on this board.  I don't know if I have ever seen a movie generate such a contrast of reactions.  I think that the people who are calling it absolute crap are people, like me, who have never really experienced a movie with such depth.  It's different.  Often things that are different are misunderstood, and ultimately rejected as awful.  In twenty years though, once people have become more accepting of this brilliant film, it will be labeled a classic. Hopefully I can hurry along the accepting process by clearing up some misguided notions held by those critical of this film.  I feel the robot not alien issue has been cleared many times over.  (Don't feel too bad if you did think that though, for the first few seconds I thought they were too.) The ending is really getting a lot of people's panties in a whirl.  Sure they could have ended it with David staring at the statue forever.  That would have made it mythical and people would have walked away going ""Oh, how profound!"".  But to end it that way would have been too obvious, and in my opinion a copout.  Stanley Kubrick was never about following traditions in film, and it definitely shows in AI.  To me, this movie was much more profound by adding the next chapter.  If it hadn't, this film's message would have been lost.  What is that message?  Whatever you want it too be. I've read many complaints about this as well.  ""What exactly was this movie trying to say?""  I think those who ask that need to realize that a theme doesn't always have to be written in ink.  Sometimes, as with this film, it's left open for the audience to decide.  I personally think it's great when a movie lets you take what you want from it.  It makes the film seem that much more personal to the viewer. Well, I think I'll stop here, not because I don't have tons more to say about this film, but because I know it probably won't matter what I say. This is just another review in an endless machine.  I do hope though that if you didn't like the film you will give it another chance.  You can't understand how monumentally frustrating it is to feel so good about a film, just to see others dismiss it as Hollywood tripe.  (Sigh) Oh well, perhaps in twenty years.....",A.I.

1387,Gigolo-Joe,"O Kubrick, Where Art Thou?",9,4 July 2001,"Stanley Kubrick could have handled this material much better and maybe have averted some of the emptiness of the ""Blue Fairy"" plot diversion but aside from that, Spielberg has made a great and bold Hollywood movie that will go on to be studied and puzzled over for a long, long time, a feat that Kubrick applied to most of his movies. Jude Law steals the show as kind of a Jiminy Cricket/Tin Man/American Gigolo who guides the robotic David (H.J. Osment) on his quest to become a real boy ( a phrase we hear about a million times during the course of the movie). Thought provoking cinema that should be viewed more than once.",A.I.

It covers many important issues, ranging from parenting to love, to our future and global warming. I won't spoil the ending of the movie, but I will say that the artificial intelligence aspect could come true.

1392,Jedi Kindergartner,"""A.I."" is a Delightful Fairy Tale for this Modern Age",10,11 August 2001,"""Please make me a real boy..."" Haley Joel Osment chillingly utters, much akin to the story of ""Pinocchio,"" from which A.I. ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE reverberates. A long-time project of Stanley Kubrick and based on a short story by Brian Aldiss, passed onto Steven Spielberg after Kubrick's death, A.I. is ultimately a futuristic fairy tale, masterfully presented by Spielberg.Though critically shunned by some, A.I. is a delight to those who probe deeper into the mists of the film. While some might find the ""Pinocchio"" references a bit cliché, A.I. really is a unique film in it's own rights, and, while it takes on the basic principles of Carlo Collodi's Italian tale of a wooden boy, Steven Spielberg breathes new life into it, forming it into a fairy tale of it's own accord as well.Stanley Kubrick shines through Steven Spielberg's magnificent directing, and every scene echoes with reflections of Kubrick. The ending, in particular, which some people seem to despise, is truly a wonderful collaboration between Steven Spielberg and Stanley Kubrick, and will have you puzzled and thinking over it for days on end. Furthermore, the last 20-minutes are the very heart and soul of this film, illuminating much and truly defining it as an epic fairy tale for this darkened age.Steven Spielberg does a fabulous job directing this fantastic tale of a robot boy, wishing to become human  But I foresee that this will quickly become like another of Spielberg's forgotten masterpieces, EMPIRE OF THE SUN. Some might hate it, and I can easily guarantee that a good portion of you who are reading this will hate it as well. The average Joe Popcorn will not be so quick to praise A.I., but those who realize that this film is ultimately a fairy tale for this modern age, able to be bent and formed by it's storyteller (much the same way Empire was told from young Jim's imaginative perspective), will realize A.I. for the masterpiece that it is.Truly, A.I. ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE is a thinking man's film, and - while I certainly don't mean to discredit the general public's intelligence - it takes a person who is willing to keep their frontal lobes switched to the ""On"" position to truly understand and enjoy this film. Those who only half-heartedly might only get a so-so delight out of this film, but those willing to challenge and probe each and every scene, and their perception of it, will undoubtedly go through nothing short of a spectacular movie experience that will remain a classic for ages upon end.On a production note, this film is almost flawless -- Brilliant, more than Oscar-worthy acting, headed by the magnificent Haley Joel Osment; Breathtaking cinematography, courtesy of Janusz Kaminski; Magnficent production and art direction (I don't think I'll ever picture New York City the same way ever again) by Rick Carter and also due, in part, to the magic of Industrial Light and Magic; Superb editing by Michael Kahn; And, of course, a truly wonderful and touching score by John Williams... The list goes on. But no review would be complete without mentioning the REAL star of the film - Teddy. This delightful little Supertoy stole every scene he was in, and deserves an honorary Oscar of his own. A near perfect film, and one which will remain in my heart for the rest of my life.",A.I.

1393,prospect83,Its prophetic vision becomes clearer with each passing year,10,14 July 2006,"Five years after its release, what can one say of ""AI""? Like the proverbial onion, AI is multi-layered; unlike the humor mag by that name, we're more apt to cry than laugh as the layers reveal themselves. There are tears of remorse, and of recognition, at the profound insights on human nature, history and destiny enfolded here ... and tears of awe, at the final layer of irony that only recent history could supply. There's far too much to even attempt addressing it all here. AI echoes Biblical themes of original sin and expulsion from Eden; of Cain and Abel, of immaculate cybernetic conception, of Pinocchio and the Blue Fairy, entwined in riddles about the inscrutability of such fundamental human mysteries as body and soul, hedonism and martyrdom, nature, creation and the hereafter, and the enigmas of human love and altruism. AI also resonates with the tragedies of the century just past  the Holocaust and the H-Bomb - and the century just barely begun at the time of its release  9/11, climate change, and Hurricane Katrina. As Jews were stigmatized as less than human, and thus, fit for Nazi extermination, for their failure to conform to the prevailing mythology of Christian ensoulment, electronic beings who - like Shylock's Jew - have the capacity to express and register compassion and pain, are deemed lesser beings, fit for brutalization and disposal by a human community itself too threatened with self-inflicted extinction to recall existential pride and joy, except through the abasement and subjugation of others. ... A book would be needed to treat all these facets fairly. Yet, AI's most profound impact seems to arise out of its unwitting foreshadowing, first of global climate change, and then, of the violence and paranoia ushered in with 9/11/01, by both sides in the ""war on terror,"" only weeks after AI hit the screens. Who can help but lose one's breath or skip a beat, at the image of World Trade Towers, first rising above a flooded Manhattan skyline, as David and Joe approach in their amphibicopter - and again, after millennia bring a new ice age, the image of the doomed towers piercing the glacier's face! Were these images not painful and prophetic enough, before the towers fell? What can it all possibly mean? Briefly put, the message AI drives home most forcefully for me, is one about the meaning of human love, in the context of parents and children, dead, living and yet unborn  of love against the backdrop of generational change, and intergenerational memory. After we're treated to the folly of Joe, a robot, playing out the superficial mechanics of romantic love, we glimpse the concept of higher love in David's capacity to be imprinted with an immutable devotion to his mother. And we're led to believe that Monica, his human ""mother,"" exemplifies a higher form of human love, by favoring her own flesh-and-blood offspring, Martin, to the robo-boy, David, when the two come into conflict. But Joe later hints at the shallowness of this human motherly love, when he speaks outside Dr. Know's pavilion, about even the love of a human mother, being more about what the child does for the parent, than about a true devotion to the happiness and welfare of the child. Remember, even as the film begins, the context is established that mankind has permitted its living children, and all future generations of humankind, to be afflicted with man-made climate change that has already flooded the flower of humanity's historical pride and glory, and the great coastal concentrations of its cultural memory  not to mention, the death by drowning of millions of flesh-and-blood children, ""other people's children."" If we cannot care enough to save these millions of fellow-humans now alive, how can we claim to have the love to protect the memories of generations past, and the dreams of generations of children to come, from man-made destruction of creation on earth? Spielberg and Kubrick appear to be saying that we true humans of flesh, blood and bone, cannot make any legitimate claim for the superiority of our species  of our unique minds and souls  if we could not muster the human feeling and caring to prevent the work of generations of our ancestors, or the hopes and dreams of our potential future flesh and blood descendants, from being wiped out through man-made climate change. In a similar vein, through the image of the robot David, chasing after the illusion of the Blue Fairy, the film-makers also seem to criticize, with subtle but stunning effect, the pre-occupation of humans  whether of Christian or other faiths  with their access to a mythical afterlife of the individual soul, when the likely effect of this pre-occupation is to ensure that living generations will be insufficiently attentive to the steps required of us, if we are to preserve any future humans to perpetuate those faith traditions  much less to live their own lives. The irony of watching future generations of evolved androids, showing more concern for the preservation of our human qualities and memories, than we had apparently shown for our own, was simply staggering. And the prospect that those qualities and memories might be embodied someday only in beings of silicon and microchips, should be motivation enough for us to rediscover the genuine love we have for our own flesh-and-blood children, and their hopes and dreams, and for us to take the lessons of more recent events  like Hurricane Katrina  and more recent films  like ""An Inconvenient Truth""  truly to heart, so that we may join with like-minded humans, and avert the realization of the direst prophesies portrayed in ""AI"". Unless humans can muster the sense to preserve our species and the Creation of which we're a part, then perhaps, Spielberg and Kubrick hint, it's our own alleged human ""intelligence"" - more than the androids' - that should be deemed ""artificial""!",A.I.

1394,tom0565,Off the mark,2,1 July 2001,"This film is quite ambitious, but fails at almost every level.  The film cannot decide if it's an ET film, a fairie tale, a morality play, a Science Fiction film or a Mad-Max adventure.  It builds no bond between the viewer and the main ""character"".  While the acting is quite good, the film never benefits from it.The themes in this film have been covered before.  Two salient examples are ""Blade Runner"" and a Twilight Zone episode called ""The Lonely"".  The film never comes close to matching these two examples.The film is so broad that they have to insert a narrator 3/4 of the way through.  A very bad sign.Add to all of this a film that is too long (2hr 20 minutes) and has no pace.My big comment is ""What a Mess""",A.I. Artificial Intelligence
1395,soolyme,"A.I. is a crowd please, if not much else.",7,1 July 2001,"I have noticed that plenty of reviews have chosen to comment on the director and his accomplice Kubrick and the movie. I will not do the same, instead I will discuss something else about the film, something that I did not expect from Spielberg film. A.I. is, in a word: uneven. We begin the film with what feels like a WaterWorld (the film with Kevin Kostner) remake, with the idea of the melted ice caps and stronger human will to live. Now, a moment later we are in what seems like a boardroom for a robot company that wants to make a mecca (machine) boy that can love. Thus the basis of the movie is made: a science-fiction film. Next we are at what seems to be a children's hospital where a family has their son in a glass case frozen because of a coma. The mother starts to read Robin Hood to the boy and then the father talks to the doctor where the doctor says something like:""it feels hopeless."" And thus it feels as though I was watching a Spielberg drama. I won't continue like this because I would give the plot away, but I can tell you that the movie seems to change genres every twenty minutes. It goes from the drama to family story, to action film, to buddy story, to fairy tale, and then gets wrapped up in an odd ending that feels so out of place and so unnecessary that I actually heard as someone left the theater say: ""Well that was pulling my teeth."" Though my friend commented: ""That comment spoils the movie,"" I chuckled and thought, ""He's right."" Some could argue that the film is not uneven, it's layered, and that the film does not misuse the genre swap, it adds genres during the story telling. I could agree to this to some extent, but whereas a layer cake has maybe three layers, sometimes four, this layer cake would have ten layers and would probably topple over. But, in a sense, that's what this movie is, a big layer cake. It looks good (witch it does, by the way, thanks to cinematographer Janusz Kaminski and visionary Spielberg which seemed to borrow a bit from Ridley Scott's Blade Runner and Kubrick's 2001: A Space Odyssey), it tastes good, and it will be remembered that way. In the end, however, there isn't much to a layer cake besides spectacle. The cake can be beautiful but meaningless in and of itself. The cake is there to please, and the bigger it gets, the more applause it gets. A.I. was born from a short story and obviously broadened to something bigger than that. Though a short story is short in length, a good one can carry a good theme, like J.D. Salinger short story, and can punch it because of its short length. A.I. is the opposite of that. It is broad and heavy handed, and instead of punching a point, it caresses a point and makes it look pretty and new, when in the end the themes of `where is home' and `how to be loved in return' and the obvious Pinocchio theme are all recycled. At the core of A.I. you can find the 5 basic ingredients as in any layer cake, no matter how big: eggs (the life), water (the theme), butter (the bulk), flour (the builder), and sugar, (the characters and details that makes the movie worth while). But the problem with A.I., while many have praised it for having the essence of two directors, is it has way too much frosting and stacks way too high.",A.I. Artificial Intelligence
1396,Lysias,Glorious Failure?,7,30 June 2001,"Well, I finished watching A.I. just a few hours ago, and I have to say that I am ultimately disappointed. I knew that it wasn't going to work as well as I had hoped, but it's hard to stop hoping all the same.That said, however, the acting performances were *universally* *superb*. Osment is not just a great child actor, he is a great actor. I was not convinced by his performance in ""The Sixth Sense"", but then, one should never be convinced by a solitary performance. Here he shows his versatility and power. Essentially this film was laid on his shoulders to carry, and he doesn't let us down at all.The set design and special effects were excellent, though I wish I had seen less in the trailer. I would have preferred not to have seen the arrival at Rouge City before, likewise the Nanny Mecha.There are a couple of little skips and tricks in logic here and there, and they're almost forgivable, but they do intrude, which is a shame. If the film had been stronger then I doubt I would have noticed, or if I had, I doubt I would have given any of it a second thought.I also found both the Narrator and some of the backing music very intrusive. I have disliked narrators ever since I saw the Director's Cut of Bladerunner. Here it is much the same -- I don't think the Narrator is necessary to the film at all. As for the music, well, John Williams is a fine composer, but at times can become a little overwrought. He needs to be put on a stern leash when it comes to dramatic emotional swells.At about the 1hr 45min mark, I started to feel an urge to check my watch. This is never a good sign in a film. I think the problem was that the arrival in Rouge City seemed to drain momentum out of the film, just when we should have been preparing for the final act.Another problem: the encounter with Dr. Know should set up the resolution. The plot needs to move straight from there fairly directly to it conclusion (as with many movies, like, say, ""A Few Good Men"" when Kaffee decides to put Jessop on the stand, or ""Alien"", when Ash is destroyed, making it possible for them to blow up the ship). It does this, but then Spielberg sticks an extra act onto the end (the under-sea sequence). Structurally it doesn't work, which is why so many people have come out saying: ""Why the hell was that ending so long and convoluted?""A.I. is a wonderfully ambitious film, and it does some things extremely well. Unfortunately, it does not succeed in becoming a great film, almost entirely because of its flawed final act.I gave A.I. 7/10.",A.I. Artificial Intelligence
1397,srosko,negative review of AI,5,30 June 2001,"I was fairly disappointed in this film for a number of reasons. The hype surrounding this movie made me expect more than I got. Yes, it was visually stimulating, but I don't feel that they did as well as they could have. The characters were developed and then acted differently from what we came to expect. I thought Jude Law and Haley Joel Osment did a fine job, but again, the script could have been better. Perhaps I was looking forward to another futuristic classic like Dune or Blade Runner. Instead I'd say this was more like something that will just fade into the background.",A.I. Artificial Intelligence

The movie changes tracks and pace so often that its obvious that they didn't know where to go with it.  I thought that the movie was good (not great) until that 7 hour ending.  It's as if they had 5 different ideas for an ending and decided to use them all. By the time the movie was over, I was hating the movie.A great performance by Jude Law, who didn't appear in the movie nearly enough.

Possibly definitely,1,24 September 2001,"From the incredibly dreary start to the amazingly ridiculous ending, this was a film to sleep through (in fact one of my friends fell asleep within the first 30 minutes).  There was nothing original about this film, it was very much a rehash of the 80's film D.A.R.R.Y.L with a dash of Waterworld at the end. This film hinges on you caring about the robot boy who just wants to be loved, but after about 10 minutes I was desperate for them to dismantle him and make Teddy the star of the film!  Teddy won hands down on popularity, if the film had just been about him, Spielberg would have had a hit on his hands.  Jude Law was good, but didn't really fit in with the film.

1403,gwoggiegwog,You just cannot describe it!,10,21 October 2001,"First of all I just want to say that this film is brilliant. But to enjoy Spielberg's masterful work it is best not to go and see it with any preconceived ideas. Its best to go with an open mind as this movie does not fit into a nice neat little box. It is not your average date movie or family movie. Its not how the trailers portray it either. It also does not come with much marketing hype although that is perhaps difficult to avoid when what you have  is a Steven Spielberg film on your hands. Nevertheless the marketing has been rather low key which is rather a pity because I am very afraid that this movie will disappear before alot of people get to see it where it should be seen and that is on the big screen and not on the smaller television one.The best way to describe this movie is with a whole list of adjectives. This film is awesome, magnificent, ahead of its time, chilling, detached, sad, disturbing, beautiful, unpredictable, wonderful, creepy, strange, hypnotic, dreamy, ambiguous and so you could go on. I must warn you I do not think its a movie to watch if you are lonely. David's epic journey in this film is a sad and lonely one. In fact the whole theme of loneliness is emphasised throughout the movie. The ending is both happy and sad and sort of leaves you with an empty feeling. Nor is it a movie to take the kids along to see. Even though the main character is a small boy this is not ET or any children's movie. It is very much a futuristic adult fairytale.When I went to see this movie the reaction from this movie was complete silence. This was the case even when people were walking out of the cinema. This is because its very hard to actually describe this movie which in no way must detract from the fact that it is a brilliant piece of moviemaking. I do not believe that this film will be justifiably appreciated right now but in 20 years time it will be the only film remembered from the year 2001. It deserves a whole host of oscar nominations. I can wholly recommend it but as I said go and see it with AN OPEN MIND!!!!",A.I. Artificial Intelligence

If this film was strictly a Spielberg film, I would be upset, but I would not feel betrayed as I am with the turn-out of this movie.  I am a huge Kubrick fan and I do not, I cannot believe for one second that the Stanley Kubrick who made such classics as, A Clockwork Orange (1971) and Dr. Strangelove (1964) had anything to do with this very Spielberg mistake.  I can sit here and write complaint after complaint of the content of the movie, from the shameless Chris Rock cameo to the unexplained and completely unrealistic conclusion to the never ending ending.

1406,kennimac,Epic,9,6 September 2006,"I saw this movie on DVD a year ago and have watched it a couple of times since and with every subsequent viewing I realise how much I love this film - it's epic. It's so under-rated, but I'm sure, like a good wine, it will gain in stature over the years. I can't believe I missed the opportunity to view it in a cinema and hope it's featured somewhere soon. The acting, camera-work, special effects and direction are all amazing - I would rate this as Spielberg's finest.Of course it's got some flaws but in the balance, these are pretty irrelevant given the scale and subject matter of the film. After every time I watch it, I come away with something new to ponder over - this is the strength of the film and something which I credit Spielberg with. He skilfully manages to tell the tale of two disparate characters and their friendship in a most tender way, but there are strong undertones of darkness in the film. The whole feeling is dream-like from beginning to end; the first time I saw this I really felt transported somewhere else and once it had finished it took me a while to come back to reality.

1407,jlc_38,High Tech Fairy Tale,3,29 June 2001,"Please don't read this if you have not seen the movie. ----------Spoilers alert----------I was very disappointed in the film. I have so many issues I can't begin to list them all. I've seen Sci-Fi T.V. shows (the new Other Limits comes to mind) that have done a better job with this kind of material. The first thing that really got me started was the way that Monica was like some housewife from the Fifties. I mean this is suppose to be set in a time when they have robots doing everything, and her husband works for the company that makes them, but there she is, making beds, and doing the laundry. What the heck's up with that? I never could get a handle on where the people in this movie were supposed to be coming from. All we see is the parents, and then the WWF rip off scene with a bunch of red neck looking folk that get a kick out of watching robots getting killed in the worse kind of ways. I kept thinking if people hated robots so much how the heck does a family have one for a son without keeping him a secret. And of course we had to have it set up so that David only imprints with Monica leaving poor old dad with lines like (he's only a toy), And of course the real son does an amazing recovery and he turns out to be a mean little guy. What's a loving Mommy to do? Drop him and his teddy in the woods all by himself so we can all have a good cry, of course. The movie really takes a nosedive after that. Are we suppose to believe that the woods are crawling with deformed robots just waiting to get their spare parts from a dump truck? Didn't the world just about end and now there dumping tons of old robot parts right there in the open ground? Please explain that to me. And then don't you think if the guy rounding up the robots saw David he'd want to cash in on this one of a kind robot instead of just wanting to destroy it? The rest of the film is too goofy to go into, except the part were he sees   all the Dave boxes and one of them jiggles. Really now are we supposed to believe that these super real robots come in big old boxes? Come on now! And the end really felt like one big sob fest set up. I think it would have been a lot better to end it in the water. At lest it would have been more convincing then the way it did end. For the record I counted 6 people leave the movie when the water scene was ending. I really though it was over to, but I looked at my watch and damn there's still 30 min's to go! The movie is nothing more then a high tech fairy tale with some really gory violence. I was expecting so much more.",A.I. Artificial Intelligence

It had a Steven King feel, the entire time you are waiting for some kind of twist or something to put it over the edge, but unfortunately it never comes.   The camera work was great; some of the shots are very powerful.  There are also some really cool special effects.   The story was not original, it is a mix of Terminator and Pinocchio and many other movies.  The movie really gets very cheesy at the end. If it ended 20 minutes earlier, I would have thought it was a better movie. All of the visually elements of the movie were great: great camera shots, great special effects, great props and sets.  The story line and the dialogue is where this film fell short.  I never could figure out if the movie was trying to be morbid/ twisted or if it wanted you to ""feel"" for the little boy.",A.I.

1409,jaffels,Teddy Bear Frankenstein,7,30 July 2001,"In time, this film will be seen as a landmark film.  Although the ending seemed to lack both drama and action, the importance of this film lies in the issues raised.When you want to illustrate the danger of creating robots that can have emotions and that can develop strong interpersonal, Steven Spielberg is a clever choice. Speilberg is known for his ability to craft emotion responses.  Using Speilberg as director is proof that we will be able to create robots that will be able to play and manipulate people's emotionsGigolo Joe (Jude Law), David (Osment) and Monica (O'Connor) all provide good performance.  Monica is struggling with the best wasy to cope with David (child, pet, toy) and societal pressures.  How will A.I life forms (mechas) cope in society and how will society cope with them.  Will there be a new form of apartheid?  It has been suggested that a new sex industry using AI life forms as the workers.  And this is another issue in the movie.  This is sci-fi looking at the current human condition and some of its flaws and warning us potential hazards in our futureYou can't be lazy in watching this film.  You have to take the ideas and build on them yourself. With Sony's Aibo robotic pet already here, it is time to start thinking.

In OTHER words... it requires INTELLIGENCE AND INSIGHT!!! I spent a great while debating with myself of whether or not the advertising for the film was either brilliant or unjustly misleading... on ONE hand... I went into the theater just to see two AMAZING directors' compilation of ideas and thoughts... without expectations of anything less than brilliant.. on the OTHER hand... I also went in expecting a less strong focus on the abandonment and survival issues... but UNLIKE MOST viewers.. I was PLEASANTLY surprised! I thought it was a shocking and brilliant twist/turn. It forced the audience to truly attach themselves to the character instead of just mindlessly observing its actions.The special effects, as in any other Spielberg, were none less than remarkable... the performances of both Osment and O'Connor were gripping... my heartstring were tugged and tossed rambunctiously! Jude Law provided a nice bit of comic relief and the voice of Williams brought me into realization that such a compilation of talented actors.. regardless how tiny the part.. came together to be a part of such GREATNESS! I am LIVID at the amount of dissatisfied viewers of the movie... this movie wasn't MEANT to be SOLELY entertaining... Good God.. it's KUBRICK'S original idea.. how can you NOT expect some sort of twist? So what it's not your TYPICAL summer movie... so WHAT it was dark??

The story is based on a short by Brian Aldiss called Supertoys Last All Summer Long (if you get the chance, read it before you see the film - it won't spoil anything). The story itself reads like a Kubrick film, and its mood was maintained throughout. Spielberg's influence clearly wasn't absent, with its persistent appeal to the viewer's emotional side through bold situations and brilliant cinematography.

As you all know, it is supposed to be a Kubrick/Spielberg hybrid, but it ends up being a little more warm'n fuzzy (ie Spielberg) than I would have liked. Having said that however, the various themes presented and outstanding performances by Osment and Law made me really enjoy this film. There are many questions posed in the movie, and although some of the answers are spoonfed to the audience, many are left with us - a typically Kubrick maneuver. Some of the devices used are a little silly, but in the end I chose to overlook them and totally dig the underlying messages delivered.

And the computer generated characters and city-scapes were the best I've seen. Rouge City in particular was beyond imagination.Unfortunately, the weight of the over-bearing preachiness of what it means to be ""human"" suffocated any chance for personal moral analysis. And the Kubrick-esque story-line wandered around, avoiding every possible decent ending it could, until it reached the final boring anti-climax, found a corner, curled up, and died. Though I enjoyed watching every moment of this movie for its aesthetic beauty, I couldn't help but roll my eyes each time the story wandered in each ridiculous new direction.All in all, I loved the idea.

Yet, it also explores the themes of technology and its effects on human society in the same way as Blade Runner and 2001, although it never quite achieves the darkness of these films.

1419,lukeedwards,I used to say that I had never seen a bad Spielberg movie.,1,29 June 2001,"I don't know where to start. I guess I should say at the outset that I made the statement to some of my friends recently, that I have never seen a Steven Spielberg film I didn't like. That was true. It isn't anymore. A. I. is...is...let me see if I can come up with a pithy, succinct, yet subtle statement regarding my opinion of this movie. This movie sucks. Okay, so it's not subtle. But, as the saying goes, two out of three ain't bad. You don't appreciate the term ""sucks""? How about pure dreck? How about really, dreadfully, bloody awful? I cannot remember the last time that I saw such an egregious waste of acting talent, time, and money on what was billed as one of the blockbuster movies of the summer. Practically every channel on cable television ran ""A. I."" promos over and over. I fell for them. I couldn't wait to see this movie. I should have waited. The credits said that Spielberg wrote the screenplay for this disaster. If he was smart, he would take his name off of this script.The movie actually starts off with a great deal of promise. A couple has lost their son to some unexplained accident? He is in some sort of suspended animation, but they are told that the current medical technology isn't capable of saving him. So...they get a robot to replace him. A ""special"" one. One that can love a human. Okay. I'll buy that. This isn't going to be easy, but they'll learn to love him, right? Well, they do. The kid is a little annoying at times, but hey, he's a robot, remember? Then all at once, the real son who was thought to be a goner, comes back. An unexplained medical miracle.  I wish I had a dollar for each example of all of the other unexplained crap in this movie. Oh dear. Now there's gonna be conflict between the real son and the one manufactured from silicon. Okay, maybe that will be interesting. Not so. The real kid is an annoying little brat and the silicon kid tries to kill him. Hey, here's some good conflict, right? Well, maybe not. Mom, the one who wanted him in the first place and claims to love him dearly, takes him out and abandons him in the woods. So much for motherly love. Neither she, nor the husband, nor the bratty kid make another appearance until the very end of the movie when Mom shows up briefly for the last scene. We never see Dad or annoying sibling again. When little David the robot gets dumped in the dark, scary woods, this abomination of a script just goes absolutely, stupidly bizarre, and that's the nicest thing I can say about it. From here on out we get a conglomeration of ""The Wizard of Oz"", ""Pinocchio"", ""Close Encounters of the Third Kind"", ""Road Warrior"", and probably a few other motifs that I didn't recognize.  David the robot wants to become a ""real boy"". He has all kinds of adventures in his search. He should have gone to see Harry Potter, but I guess he wasn't available. Whatever.  One of the most annoying, pointless scenes in the latter part of this movie is the sudden, and completely unexplained appearance of his creator, the part played by William Hurt. Will Spielberg or someone tell me what the purpose of this scene was? Please? Hurt shows up in the drowned city of Manhattan. He tells Davis a bunch of mysterious mumbo jumbo, and then he says that he is going to go get some people who want to see David and then he disappears. Never to be seen again. Huh? What was that all about? It just goes on and on. I honestly thought that this movie was over three different times. Here I am all primed for the final scene and then this whole jumbled mess takes off again. I distinctly remember saying to myself, ""When is this going to end so I can go back out in the sunlight?""

There are so many questions that are placed in your mind as you watch this movie, as well as memories of growing up. This is what makes Steven's movies so magical for me.As David makes his journey through the futuristic landscape, he remains innocent, almost angelic.

This is a movie that is overly-long and tedious.  It tries to be grandiose in its philosophy, but misses the point time after time and eventually devolves into silliness. Its futuristic technologies are not consistent.  It blatanly rips off old-time fairy tales in an attempt to save itself, and instead comes across as only ludicrous.

1426,ecaravel,Spielberg owes me $42. AI is a Bad Movie.,1,29 June 2001,"AI is a bad movie.  People started walking out of the theater after about an hour.  I stayed thinking it would have to get better.  I was wrong.AI starts with an interesting premise but quickly devolves to where it becomes laughable.  Going into a movie made by Kubrick and Spielberg I had very high hopes.  The first chip in those hopes unfortunately came in the first few seconds of the movie where a narrator explains what terrible thing we humans did to the world (AI seems to take place in the near future, perhaps 2300).None of the characters are likable or even interesting, although Gigolo Joe did provide some nice comic relief.  The mom who decides it's a good idea to drop off her ""son"" in the forest to fend for himself.  Come on!  The gratuitous wrestle-mania meets Robo-wars violence was disgraceful.  The hokey Ewok-inspired sidekick teddybear made me go ""pfffttt"" whenever he came on the screen.  The Close Encounters-inspired, all-knowing, benevolent heros at the end were like a 12-year old's school story, ""and then I woke up from a dream..."".  The Star Wars-inspired ""stay on target"" scene was just a blatant rip off and I can't imagine why they bothered.  There's more characters to hate but these ones jump out from my memory.  Add to this the fact that the story is so weak and incongruous that they repeatedly have to introduce Obi-Wan like characters to explain why yet another unbelievable situation is actually plausible.  Uh, that could happen.  Really.  No Really!Even all of this would be forgivable if the actual message of the movie wasn't so awful.  ""Just keep hoping all your problems will go away and they will.""  No need to actually do anything to work toward your goals, overcome any obstacles showing your strong character, or even be subject to those silly rules rational people call the physical laws of the universe -- like gravity.  Just sit down and keep repeating, ""There's no place like home."" I hate to even reference a wonderful movie like The Wizard of Oz.  AI is no Wizard of Oz.This is a bad movie.  Stephen Spielberg should be ashamed of himself.  At least if it were a Kubrick movie it wouldn't have a silly, cuddly, completely ridiculous ending.  I blew $17 on tickets and $25 for a babysitter, but that isn't nearly as bad as the three wasted hours of my life for this incredibly disappointing movie.

1428,syzfrost,A Movie with Great potential gone slightly wrong.,6,29 June 2001,"A.I., is a quite interesting movie visually, conceptually and most importantly emotionally.  The first thing that caught my attention was the fact, the I could 'feel' something for a robot.  This is where this movie was strong.  Weaknesses on the other hand were plenty. The main thing that this movie lacked was unity.  There are three main parts to the movie, each having its unique style and feel.  Separately, each part is gratifying as any good movie, but together, all three parts did not hold together.  In my opinion, the links were too weak.  The worst part about the clashing, is the fact that the makers of this film were aware of them, and instead of manipulating the scenes more to make the movie flow, they went for the quick fix.  Each of the three parts had a blunt explanation of what is going on.  As if there was no other way to link the sections of the movie,  the situations are 'literally' spoon fed to the audience.  At some points things even became really far fetched.  So much so, that the movie left the Science Fiction realm and entered the Fantasy world.  This can bee seen as a good or a bad thing.  In my opinion, it detracted from a movie, making it somewhat unbeliveable and outlandish.If you are looking for visual splendor and to be moved by sweet emotional sequences, this movie is for you.If you are looking for a movie which will leave a lasting impression, go see something else.",A.I.

1429,Siege-1,Things to think about *spoilers*,9,1 July 2001,"This is a Steven Speilberg film. In a way he dedicated it to the late Stanley Kubrick, but it still remains a Speilberg film. You can't criticize the film just because you feel it isn't done in a manner that Kubrick would have fashioned it in.That aside, I absolutely loved this film. It is a sci-fi classic and will undoubtedly be looked back on in the future as something special by those that dislike it now. I can bet you that. Osment gives an Oscar nominating performance beyond a shadow of a doubt. He plays the young robot like no other child actor could. From not blinking, to moving appropiately, and delivering his lines in a sense of not being of this world so to speak. We don't just get Osments strong performance, but also my favorite character in the movie, Giggalo Jo. Jude Law shows us again his talent is without bounds and any part he plays will be given the full treatment of outright brilliant proportion. His last line in the film will always be remembered.Technically the movie is astounding. From Stan Winstons 'Teddy' to the water submerged MANhattan, Speilberg pulls no stops in his endless special effects repotoire. John Williams score is mezmorizing and should also garner an Oscar nomination as he continues to support Speilberg with his amazing talent.AI is deep. Maybe too deep for the casual movie fan. It sometimes seems to stray off track and leave you to ponder what just happened when suddenly something else becomes of importance in the plot. The ending might irritate you and seem like it should end, but doesn't and proceeds to do the same thing yet again. Some of you may find it cheesy and hard to swallow. I on the other hand found it perplexing and downright brilliant. See below for more info. But to wrap things up, I just want to say I understand alot of Kubrick fans wanted this film to be more, but don't discredit the film because it's not what you expected. Go see it a second time as a Spielberg movie and what will stand as one of the greatest science fiction movies of our time.3 3/4 stars out of 4*****SPOILERS******I've read alot of people have wrote off the ending as being cheesy and doesn't belong with the rest of the film. I was just wondering if any of you had actually thought about the ending and how the 'aliens' might have been advanced meccas that were the solo survivors at the worlds end. As they did call Humans 'perfect.' They were also only content on making David happy...could they relate to him being AI as they were themselves?Another way I view the ending is that these 'advanced meccas' used the same procedure as they did on the Mother to David. This way he spends the one and only day of his life doing what he wanted to do all along.Just a few ideas to chew on that some of you may find impossible to believe, but something to think about none the less.*******SPOILERS********",A.I.

1433,unity2k,The Deeper Spiritual Meaning of AI,10,30 June 2001,"Although early in release, someone needs to begin an analysis of the symbolisms and meaning of this incredible movie AI.  Here's my take from beginning to end, be forewarned that this is my interpretation of the film and may prove a plot spoiler for those who've not yet seen the film. If in fact you are not planning to see the movie because someone told you something negative about AI, then read this and then decide if maybe the reviewer you are listening to missed an interpretation of what the film and the Directors may have meant to share with the audience.From the beginning of the film we are faced with man's desire, and what appears to be a selfless act to do something good, and so a Robot is born. The Robot has been programmed to love and we look at how a Robot and Human might bond, more to the point we look in the mirror of how we bond with things or people unknown. The Robot grows through the emotions of happiness, fear, jealousy, abandonment, and will find the determination to start on a quest to fulfill its destiny, which is to become human.  Through the Robot's own twist of fate, it finds itself before the object which the Robot believes will make it human. The Robot sits there and for 2000 years has the faith not to lose its gaze on that which promises to be its savior. As theRobot has endured its frozen, cold, abandoned, and lonely environment it emerges from its isolation to reach out and touch the phantom icon, only to witness it crumble before its eyes. The presence of another being then proceeds to take the Robot and explains certain realities of being and the temporary nature of the now apparently extinct Human population. They see the Robot as the last surviving example of this great culture. Granting the Robot its wish, these creatures allow the boy to be rewarded with his desire to be loved unconditionally. This is the love that once known becomes the basis for his dreams and his sense and accomplishment of achieving humanness.This movie is about Humanity, our relationship with each other, and our faith. It follows the basic flow of development of any one of us after birth, how we learn to laugh, and cry, fear, and experience joy. It looks at the commonly felt emotion of abandonment, that some feel toward God and our perceptions of the tragedies that exist on earth. In man's desire to create something good, we see his motivation may not be as pure as we first perceive it to be, that it may be a selfish act that has the potential to hurt others, but that in the end may have a better outcome than had Humanity not strived to accomplish great things that exceeded our understanding. As the Robot's quest takes it on its journey, it finds no time for sentimentality or reflection, running blindly after the promise of salvation; it has faith. After coming face to face with its sacrosanct icon and not receiving the immediate gratification it thought was its due, the Robot has to endure 2000 years with the object of salvation just out of reach and apparently cold, uncaring, and unsympathetic to its quest. The faith to believe carries the Robot through the ages until benevolent beings appear and free the Robot. I suggest that the viewer not look at these beings as aliens, but try to understand that had the Directors used a voice-over to impart the presence of a spiritual being, the audience would have seen this as either the voice of God or that of a narrator. These beings I believe are our souls, which even they do not understand themselves to be. These beings or spirits *are* in this future date the archeologists of a great hidden and now nearly vanished culture of which only fragments are found, similar to any of our studies of the Egyptian, Native American, or Jurassic ages. Like us, these beings are looking back upon their own history and origins.AI is a reminder of the journey of the soul in a man or woman to know who we are through the enlightenment of finding our Messiah, God, or Savior. It is a brilliant movie that will by its nature and subtlety confuse and probably attract misunderstanding and ridicule, as a large part of the audience will not understand the depths of story telling that these great Directors achieved with their desire to shed light on our own humanity and our own quest to rise to the heights of the heavens.",A.I.

Yes, there were several special effects that were outstanding (I especially enjoyed the one in the opening scene when the female Mech's face unhinged and opened up. The transitioning between a human face and the Mechanical one was nearly flawless.)With that said, the rest of the movie was just ... gawd awful. I have to think (actually, hope) that this was mostly a Spielberg effort rather than Kubrick. The Kubrick I knew would never have used a PC dogma du jour (global warming) as part of a timeless work of art. Then there was the whole Sin City scene which had no relevance to the plot line at all except to do a cheap (and sleazy) knockoff of The Wizard (Dr. Know) of Odd's Emerald City. The whole thing reeked with immature oral sex connotations having absolutely nothing to do with the story line.They could have cut the whole 30 minutes of that scene and the movie would have been much better for it.

This  movie is, after all, a fairy tale.  I guess if people want to hate the ending, that's their choice, but I don't think it ought to overshadow what is altogether a terrificly engaging movie-going experience.  One review even said this movie was ""boring!""  I don't know what he was expecting, but this is one of the most intriguing films I've seen in quite awhile.

1437,Jafredderf,A.I. Is a good union of two great film makers.,8,1 July 2001,"I saw A.I. on the first night it ran here and I must say I was disappointed in the size of the audience. How strange to see so few people show up for a Spielberg film. This film did not enjoy the normal hype that most of Spielberg's films enjoy, I think I know why. Lack of product placement. They're may have been some somewhere but I didn't see them.  A.I.'s story line and flawless visual effects reflect what I can only describe as the meeting of two great film makers. Kubrick (who started work on the project after he read the Aldiss book in '83),and Steven Spielberg who's long list of intelligent blockbusters made him the perfect person to bring this story to the screen. I could, I believe see the story boards and concepts Kubrick developed and I could also see the sensitivity that Spielberg added to scenes and characters. These two things are not entirely separate in good Science Fiction. All good science fiction has some human sensitivity in it otherwise it would just be a horror film. The script reflects some of the darkness and coldness that sometimes underlies each character human and machine, there is no fear of this in the story. This darkness draws us on in the story.The visual effects are stunning and come darn close to genius. The story line takes us in and the visuals make it almost real.I wish I had Mr. Mannings grip of syntax, but all in all at the end of the day it's good science fiction and a good story too.  I beleve that Stanley Kubrick's choice of asking Steven Spielberg to make this film was the kind of genius that Kubrick showed in all his work. It is a tribute to both men that they saw a vision of something and worked toward it's creation. I think they came to a great place in film making.",A.I. Artificial Intelligence

With effects comparable to Star Wars 1: The Phantom Menace and What Dreams May Come, A.I. is worth a visit simply for the visual repertoire. Aside from its the ocular spectacle, Osment plays the best role I've ever seen someone that young play. Osment should be garnered with his second nomination at this year's Academy Awards. On a more negative note, John Williams did not follow through in this one, for the score was a cheap Truman Show replica. In addition, also on the negative side, the dialogue was prolonged, for unnecessary discussions roamed, making you fall back into your seat thinking: ""At what time did it start?"" All in all, the movie was a success and even though Kinglsey isn't exactly exciting and dialogue did run astray, Osment's robotic love keeps you in your seat thinking: ""He's just a boy!""",A.I.

Why Spielberg felt compelled to wrap this movie up in a little package at the end escapes me.  After all, it is not a kids' movie, and was not marketed as one.  I thought it was trying to appeal to ""thinking"" types, like fans of 2001: A Space Odyssey and the like.  Guess not. Kubrick fans will be disappointed with the turn this movie takes in the last 40 minutes or so.  The first hour/hour and a half was very good. I wish I had walked out with the other 15 or 20 people after the underwater scene--I think I would have left the movie feeling good about it.

A dark city world, bringing in some kind of counterbalance towards the clean life of the mechas, reminds me of Stanley Kubrick's Clockwork Orange. The Flesh-Fair-Stadium with Gladiator-Battles reminds me of a modern Rock concert, David Fincher's Fight Club and Ridley Scott's Gladiator. In the second part of A.I. you can find parallels to The Wizard of Oz and Blade Runner. But A.I. is no bundle of great films. There are only these parallels towards other masterpieces; the story and the film in the whole gives us something, which has never been on the silver screen. Especially the end of the film doesn't remind me of 2001 - A Space Odyssey because of its content, moreover because of its mystic, positive (or negative?) and great ending. A.I. consists of several blocks, which does not fit together on the first view, but they yield one imposing whole such as 2001. Optically A.I. is a massive force, as regards content as well. An in detail thought over technical plausibility is connected with mystic and philosophical elements, a daring and analytic view is paired with effective pictures. Gratitude goes to one great actor: Haley Joel Osment, who is the center of the film such as the monolith in 2001. The other actors are good as well. Jude Law as Gigolo Joe plays a brilliant part as well as Frances O'Connor with a remarkable talent for sentimental scenes. A.I. is not only an optically overwhelming vision of the future, at the most comparable with Blade Runner. In addition, the set decoration is absolute perfection. Many critics consider the first half of A.I. the Kubrick-Touch (=dark) and the second half the Spielberg-Touch (=more warm-hearted). The critics criticize this 'illogical' combination. But they overlook two things by claiming this: On the one hand Kubrick himself wanted the Spielberg-Touch, because the film shouldn't be too dark and philosophical. And on the other hand they forget that the director of Close Encounters of the Third Kind and E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial is also the impressive director of Schindler's List and Saving Private Ryan. Moreover it is just dumb to discuss where Kubrick ends and Spielberg starts, because A.I. is just a film of Steven Spielberg based on ideas of Stanley Kubrick (and Brain Aldiss and Ian Watson!!!). (Such as Saving Private Ryan isn't a movie only by Screenwriter Robert Rodat)A.I. is the most daring and many-sided Science-Fiction-Vision since 2001 - A Space Odyssey. Never since the Release of Kubrick's masterpiece a Science Fiction Film has been filled with such an impressive and overwhelming content (and ending!). For me A.I. is the best Sci-Fi movie since 2001, better than any other movie in between. And it is one of Spielberg's best movies next to Schindler's List, Saving Private Ryan and E.T.And YOU all have to think about this film, if you do not like it. Every time a great movie appears you will find it out years later what it's worth is. A.I. is great, because there are so many things to think about: Many possibilities for interpretations (e.g.: A.I. Ending) and many questions to ask: What is a human being? When are you human? What does us make human? The love, the death, the faith? Are we allowed to love robots? Can we love them when they love us? Does a robot have the same rights? Can a robot replace a human being in things such as love, having feelings? Does he have personality? When we do not love them can we simply (as in A.I. it was a choice for Mr. Swinton) give them back or destroy them? Has a robot child the same rights as a human brother (like in A.I.: it wasn't)? And you can ask more questions and try to answer them or to think about them. I think, when the time is come for the first robots (like in A.I.), the people will talk about the motion picture by SpielbergIt is a pity that A.I. has not done well at the Academy Awards, Golden Globes etc. and in critic's views. I do believe, after years and after the release of the Director's Cut of A.I., all the people considering 2001 a masterpiece are going to consider Spielberg's A.I. a masterpiece and one of our most significant movies of all time.

This movie in my eyes was a great homage to the late great Stanley Kubrick because it has the audience doing exactly what he would have wanted them to; Debated it.
The underlying theme is what it takes to be human, and David hard to believe it had everything that it took.  He just like every son and daughter wanted to be loved, he wanted to be loved so badly and be one of a kind that he was willing to commit suicide and even out of jealousy destroy another.  He was able to feel pain as was shown when he was looking for protection.  He was able to cry which shows sadness.  He may have made mistakes and done things wrong but I feel that everyone who doesn't know better does make mistakes.

The unpredictability is what made this film unique.True it turned out to be a modern day fairy tale, but I really don't understand what people are criticizing because every Kubrick film makes you think as does this film, even though it was Spielberg.
As far as the ending being the most debated part wasn't that the most debated part of Eyes Wide Shut.  I felt it wasn't a Kubrick ending but a Spielberg happy ending.  But I felt it was needed to Answer the underlying question could a person love a machine which was the first question asked in the movie.  Also I feel that you shouldn't think of it as a Kubrick or Spielberg film because than you expect a lot from the film.There is so much more I could say but I will leave it to you, if you go to a movie with plans to think about it I feel you will enjoy this film as it's not for people just looking for entertainment.

Combine with a screenplay developed in part by Kubrick, and you get the cover of an impressive movie.  But that's all you get.  While the effects were impressive, and some parts were especially moving, this alone does not a good movie make.While I won't discuss the plot, the Ending was really what ruined my impression.  Up until the resumption of the troublesome and less than subtle off screen narrative, I thought Sp. had a good thing going.  Some parts were hairy, but the good outweighed the bad.  The ending, to speak plainly, sucked.Besides being hopelessly contrived (and as an s/f fan, I can bend pretty far), the end, in my opinion, sacrificed much of the theme, and indeed Power of the story to create a situation that would appeal to the mass audience. (I am oft of the opinion that directors these days woefully underestimate the movie-going public).  Thematically, AI leaves you with the impression that love unconditional will always result in happiness, if given enough time.  A message that is idealistic at best, but imho, Kubrick is turning in his grave as we speak.  Faced with this capitulation of a conclusion, all the faults of the film come crashing down.Spielberg had the opportunity to create a movie that was both poignant and beautiful, but ended up with a sci-fi flick destined for mediocrity.",A.I.

The story is choppy and new story lines are introduced in a near linear format. At points its unclear what direction the movie was heading. After awhile I just stopped caring. Top it of with gratuitous violence and overt sexual content that are meaningless to the story. I'm no prude, but they are marketing the movie to a PG-13 audience. The child abandonment aspect makes it horrible in appropriate for young adopted children.Disney knew how to stir the emotions of a child and deliver them back to safely with a parent by his/ her side. This movie shocks and disturbs the child without the confidence of a caring parent to protect them. There's one positive depiction of an African-American woman who discussed the conundrum of a machine programmed to love a human and possibility of a human failing to love a machine. This was a wonderful morality discussion. However, the next interaction with an African-American is an Amos and Andy, blackface robot being destructed in a gruesome `angry mob' display. We discussed the movie on our way home. The conclusion was disappointment and resentment for attempting to force tears. The trailers lead you to believe that a rejected child automaton joins a band of rebels fighting to achieve a superior goal.

I was in a jam packed theater and the movie is somewhat flowing and it kept me very interested on a visual level.  However, the last 40 or so minutes a majority of the viewers at this theater were laughing at scenes that were obviously meant to be serious and emotional.  I too could not help but laugh at some of these over the top scenes as well.  Spielberg had a couple of chances to end this movie in earlier scenes and save face.  Instead he chose to take a Disney approach to movie making and the result is a bad movie. I am somewhat embarressed for some of the great performances given by Haley and Jude.

SO LACKING IN IMAGINATION!
For a science fiction movie, there were blatant and glaring violations of plausibility. As far as the drama goes, I was not touched. This story presented nothing new, very little that was thoughtworthy, and a woeful absence of substance.Nowadays movies cannot pass the muster with mere special effects.  There must also be a thoughtful examination of some aspect of humanity or at least it should provide an exciting vicarious experience.  This movie did neither.

Will it show machine finally surrender human life? Surely, the movie elaborates around this issue, but as in a true science fiction movie, it doesn't give you any straight answers. As for Kubrick, there are scenes and elements that can be associated with 2001, but the one movie that strikes me is Spielberg's ""Close Encounter of The Third Kind."" And in the end, I am left with the feeling that this is a Spielberg production, but with Kubrick's spirit present.
In an overall perspective, this could have been three short movies with all different endings. It borrows themes and elements from Star Wars, (orphanage-parents theme) fantasy movies (The Wizard of Oz) fairy tales and Spielberg's earlier sf-productions (E.T., Close Encounter) The first part is very promising, with a typical science fiction setting, where the facinating but cold, and sometimes disturbing vision associated with Kubricks movies, is present. Here Haley Joel Osmont (as David the robot) shows his emotional register, which doesn't change much after the first part. Frances O'Connor (Davids mother) is left with a conflict between her feelings and her distance that could have been explored more in debth. She is after all, the only human who is truly attached to David. The second part seems to me to be too ""compromised"" both in content and length between the first and the third. The scenes are changing rapidly, as the movie changes from science fiction (with Jude Law as an excellent gigolo robot by the way) to that of a fairy tale.In the third and shortest part, which is the strongest part, we're again back to the science fiction setting. But here, both the audience and the characters have changed their view upon what appears to be real and what appears to be fantasy. In the end, we're no longer sure, but as in any Spielberg movie, we feel sympathy for the ""child"" David and his too-much-longing for his mother. Kubrick of course would have made a different ending, leaving the sometimes overwhelming emotionally scenes behind; but then again, he would also have created a different David, and a different development in the story.In the end, I am left with the question: Is A.I. showing technology surviving human life, or is it showing human life master technology to the point where technology becomes more human than human itself? I think both Kubrick and Spielberg were fascinated by this dilemma, and in the most masterful scenes in A.I., I discovered an encounter of Kubrick's spirit and Spielberg's vision. It is not a close encounter, but that of a different kind. As a result, it is something you have never seen before.",A.I. Artificial Intelligence

Haley Joel Osment is a real treasure . . . I only hope the young man continues to choose roles as carefully as he has been. The basic question the films asks of ""Can a human love a robot?"" and ""Should a robot be created to love a human?"" are explored in an emotional journey that does not fully answer these questions, but brings up further ethical questions in the viewer's mind.

I won't go on to the movies details, see it for yourself, you'll get a better kick out of it. Instead I will talk about how i felt.
This is no ordinary film at all, it combines the two of the greatest film makers, one to captivate you and make you cry your heart out, the other to make you think in a way that you never would have in any other movie. By thinking, it is already unique, it's not mindless shooting of weapons and gore splattering all over the floor, and walls, there is nothing to think about, you have no message to decipher, no thought involved. But in this movie, sadly, the last of the Kubrick collection, you are taken into humanity and shown if and how love can be possible for a ""mecha"" and ""orga"", other then sexually. You are shot out into the strangest places, to find an understanding, but it's not quite there.
I have read many reviews till I wrote mine, but none of the negative reviews brought up a point on to why they disliked it, many just say that it would have been perfect, but the last 30 minutes ruined it.

1469,pamkstewart,That's real love? ***spoilers***,5,6 July 2001,"The most disturbing thing I found about the movie was the fact that almost none of the reviewers (only one of the hundred or so reviews I read) seemed to question that the robot boy was exhibiting ""real"" love. It sure didn't look like love to me. I saw absolutely no concern for the object of his ""affection"", but instead unending neediness and a ceaseless demand for her attention. As examples of his ""love"" he follows her around doggedly, almost blinds her, and almost drowns someone she obviously cares for (don't you think his programming would include some injuction against harming humans and the fact that people can't breathe water?).
After being abandoned by her, he still longs only for her ""love"" to justify his existence. Although he has exhibited jealousy and anger in other contexts there seems to be none toward her. After a quixotic search for the Blue Fairy (reasoning that only by changing completely will he be lovable), meeting with his makers, going into despair, and waiting tirelessly for two thousand years focused obsessively on this ""love"", he finds the object of his desire at last. He is told that with the current state of technology, if he brings her back now, she will live for only one day and they can never try again. In his final act of ""love"", to make HIM happy, he insists that they bring her back immediately so she can validate him and tell him he is lovable, thus insuring her death forever. There is never any question of waiting to  see if the technology can mature and they can give her a more permanent existence, one possibly where SHE might benefit from the experience, as well. There is never any thought for HER happiness...what SHE would like or benefit from. Where is the love in this?On a related note, why is it that the robot once imprinted can only love the one person? Why having loved once can the robot not love another? Is this supposed to be another aspect of ""real love""? Does ""real love"" mean loving only one...only once?To me this movie seems like a cautionary tale, showing what horrors can be generated when your definition of love is severely limited and bounded by need and insecurity rather than concern for your loved ones. It does not seem at all like a paen to love and the human spirit, ""happy"" ending notwithstanding. In fact the whole movie seems to resonate with an extremely dark view of humanity (it gave me a chill when I read one reviewer's certainty that this is what the future holds for mankind). The only one who displayed any concern for anyone else's feelings was Teddy. He seems much more evolved than the boy to me...perhaps they had already achieved their objective with him and should have quit while they were ahead.",A.I. Artificial Intelligence

I guess this is one that folks will either love or hate. I thought this film nearly transcendental in its message(s), in that it combined philosophy, metaphysics, psychology, and science fiction into one story. Would Stanley Kubrick have liked this result? I don't know. It does seem to be a fusion of two styles (Kubrick & Spielberg), but I thought it worked wonderfully, both as story, movie, and even fairy tale. Whoever wrote that the viewer should put away the ""12 Steps to Dissecting a Movie"" mentality was absolutely correct; this is a movie about love and evolution and what's ""real."" Even the title - ""Artificial Intelligence"" - is a play on words, because isn't intelligence intelligence? Artificial means not real - though I will shortly look up the word to find out more about it. Should it have ended at the bottom of Coney Island? I thought it would when I saw it. The next phase had me wondering whether Mr. Spielberg had gone too far in search of, if not a happy ending, then a poignant one. Beyond poignancy, though, it was about fulfillment and memories and the reminder that, really, all we have is one day at a time, with the rest being, at best a guess. I think Spielberg did his best to pay Kubrick an homage, but that doesn't mean that he set out to make a film the way Stanley would've made it. This film stayed with me, has stayed with me.

It jumped around to scenes that really didn't seem to have to do anything with the movie overall.  It just didn't have any goal. The largest problem was that you never felt emotional for David, the little boy.  He seemed detached because he always had this confused look on his face.  Not until the very last half hour does he show any emotion.  That is not to say that Haley Joel Osment didn't do a great job.  He was one of the only things that kept the movie going. The other problem was the timing of the ending.  It could have happened a lot earlier.  The last half hour seemed to drag on.

Too bad we couldn't be watching his story.The visual style of the film is very good, but we've seen it before in ""Blade Runner."" This film, like too many Hollywood films, is all style and no story.

There is a good deal of sexuality in the film, some implicit and some overt.  This would make me somewhat uncomfortable taking a child to see it.  On the other hand, the use of the ""Pinocchio"" fairy tale as the core metaphor makes it unlikely adult fare.  Unlike the movie ""Shrek,"" which the audience knows is a fairy tale from the beginning, ""A.I."" tries to become one later along after great attempts at realism.  I was unwilling at this point to accept such a leap, and noticed that many other filmgoers were also reticent about the transition.  As a result, the movie ""A.I."" fails in doing in about 140 minutes what ""Shrek"" does in less than 80--persuade the audience to go along for the mythological ride.

Stark is another term I would use.After the first part (not act,) the movie begins to get a bit sloppy, in my opinion -- the resolution to the issues surrounding the child's pursuit by individuals who, IMO, would see themselves as salvage collectors is trite.I have the greatest difficulty with the ending portion (third).  It was the most Spielberg and least Kubrick-like part, according to reviews that I have read, and I agree.  I think that it was too long and drawn out.  From the underwater part through the ultimate resolution of the film, in my view, was more like a fairy-tale (Pinocchio) than science fiction or even fantasy.  I guess it was too lacking in substantial content for me -- relying on mostly emotional attempts at sorrow, empathy, or pity depending upon your point of view.I also guess that Spielberg may have tried for an ending that was faintly reminiscent of that for Kubrick's ""2001:  A Space Odyssey"" and I did not care for it in AI.  I didn't care for it in 2001 either, come to that.  I think it may have been better if you were trippin' (in the ""60s"" - 1964-74 silly parlance I believe) when you saw 2001.I don't mean to imply that I dislike Steven Spielberg films or sentimental movies at all.

And in this case, particularly the end, had too little substance for it's length and tried to coast on emotion for too long.  Had it been more of a plot-driven movie, though, I do not think it would have been too long of a film.Also, if the phrase ""long, lingering, loving, close-up shots of Haley Joel Osment's face and his expressive eyes and I get to appreciate his wonderful acting talent at holding his eyelids open for long periods and mimicry or robotic/human mannerisms and how to move between them"" appeals to you might want to add a point to my rating of this movie.  AI will give you the time to appreciate that.  I did not go for that reason, I am believe I am more plot (I do not say ""action"" deliberately) driven.  Some may take credit for the philosophical issues raised.  They were a sideline to the movie, not a central point, IMO, and I think they are raised by some who wish to praise a movie with a reason that is difficult to dispute.On a scale of 10 I gave it a 7, and I was being generous.  My immediate impression after leaving the movie was a 5 or 6.  I hope these comments are useful.  And I don't think I was let down by the hype, because I knew going in that some people didn't care for the film.  I went in knowing that and was still underwhelmed, particularly while waiting for the end.  It appeared to me that they were stuck as to how to end the movie -- particularly placing a Spielberg end of a Kubrick film.  Difficult, obviously.  I don't know if they succeeded.SUMMARY OPINION:  7/10",A.I. Artificial Intelligence
1481,mlabo,A great tale of identity.,10,11 July 2001,"Yesterday, I decided suddenly to go watch A.I. Before, I received various commentaries and I wasn't really sure what the movie would look.I never seen a movie like this. Truly.Haley Joel Osment (good spelling?) is simply perfect. The way he looks at everything is so unique. The way he talks, he moves makes him look like a robot, but also with some humans parts. Jude Law also plays like I never seen him plays before. He looks so like a robot. All his movements reflects the mechanic of his character. Also Teddy, who is the most engaging digital character of all the movies I've seen.I must talk also of Steven Spielberg. He gives us a great masterpiece. All the story is told by the images, not by the dialogs. He's a master. The story he tolds really makes me think about our uniqueness, as humans. The best moment of the movie, in my opinion is when David enters the room full of Robots. We realize here our luck to be humans.I can't say anymore about this movie, except go see it.",A.I.

1482,kaboomy,An emotional and visual masterpiece,10,11 July 2001,"The bottom line is this movie is the most entertaining film I've seen all year.  There may be many people out there with attention spans too short to deal with a movie over two hours long, but for the rest of you, this movie is well worth the time you spend.  I have to say I was skeptical at first, but it kept my interest throughout. I think the low ratings by many of the viewers may be a bit harsh.  This is mostly because of the expectations that people have from both Kubrick and Spielberg.  As it turns out the two geniuses meld very well.  The futuristic chaotic robot and human world is a world that you'd never expect Spielberg to use, but he brings it to life and gives it a hyper emotional feel. It is also by far the most beautiful movie I've seen in a long time.  The direction was artistically brilliant.  Great angles and special effects, good colors and sets.  The world was very foreign, and sometimes confusing, but emotionally it connects.  As well as on an emotional level the movie connects on a spiritual level, raising many questions about what emotions really are, and what it means to be human. The most important thing about the movie though, as is true with any movie, is that it was fun and entertaining.  I have no regrets after seeing this movie, except perhaps that Kubrick wasn't around to aid Spielberg somewhat in the direction.  Out of ten stars I give it a perfect 10.  What are you waiting for?

1483,malfunkt I,Awful Intelligence,1,12 July 2001,"This has to be one fo the worst movies of the millenium, up there with ""Star Wars:TPM"", ""Mission to Mars"", and the hilarious ""Battlefield Earth"". I suppose if one never contemplated if an artificially intelligent lifeform could have a ""soul"" nor had read any of the greater works of sci-fi that has dealt with AI, then ""A.I."" might seem poignant.This pseudo sci-fi fairy-tale takes you on a trip through a cut and paste Speilbergian wasteland. You'll join David for his search for the Blue Fairy, along with a robo gigolo and a cuddly robo bear.Warning : Spoilers Ahead. The bear was actually less annoying than some movie sidekicks (such as Jar Jar Binks) cause he seemed a bit angry. The bear kept making these grunts and growls whenever the plot started to stink, almost as if he was ""really"" pissed at being part of this lame adventure. Ironically, the bear seemed to be the smartest of all the lifeforms, having a foresight for what might happen in the future (such as saving a lock of hair from the mother so that David could become real). Go figure... 2000 years later Earth's new lifeform bring David's mother back to life thanks to DNA! They also tell us how subspace particles are related to life and how that life conduit can only be used once (I guess this is only true for organic life; not mechas), thanks Speilberg, you are truly a god! Tell us how it is! The movie's message isn't difficult to deliver, however, and Spielberg drives it home relentlessly. It will no doubt get some people thinking, for others crying, and a few of us laughing (the peak of this will be when the Blue Fairy comes to life as a Disney animated projection at the end to deliver the moral of the story).",A.I.

Did I mention that this movie is slow?Not like molasses, but slow like reading a completely negative review of a movie that you went to see and liked immensely. You keep fidgeting because you're thinking, ""OK, I saw the movie and drew my own conclusions -- best movie since Citizen Kane! -- but I'm still reading this review, I scrolled down all the way to it, so I'll keep reading it until it's over."" OK, it's over.No, wait, I have some more comments to tack onto the end of this review. I hated the aliens. ""Gee, humanity screwed up the earth and the Ice Age came. And the robots outlived us! But not by forever, so I guess they sucked, too. But one robot got dug up and guess what? He wants to die anyway."" Did I mention there are maybe seven different ""endings"" to this movie, counting thematic shifts, except you don't get to choose, you have to watch every one of them. Shall I illustrate why this is boring in my review? No, I just don't have the energy -- it was all sapped by watching AI.But, I know you're thinking, ""At what point will I be forced to walk out of this movie?"" The sad truth is that you will stay throughout the entire movie. You will sit through the director(s?) beating you over the head with the deus ex machina crow bar of the ""child-like"" ""innocence"" of a robot programmed so well to be a child he's too stupid to realize he's drowning someone else (among ten other ""plot-advancingly stupid"" things he does). You will watch stupid and ""obsolete"" robots at the Flesh Fair plead for their robotic lives to comic effect, then watch the robot kid be saved when a woman in the audience shouts, ""Robots don't plead for their lives!"" -- obviously proving that the robot kid is different.And, you will watch as a hooker-bot threatens the superiority of humans by being able to screw better than humans.

Once the aliens showed up, Spielberg (or whoever) had the audacity to make the suggestion that the human race is so impressive and so genius that these aliens (who can control things with their minds and are obviously far superior even to the futuristic humans) marvel and envy us.RIIIIGGGHHHTTT.But that's more of a technical error.  There are lots of technical errors, most of which one expects in sci-fi these days, as it's hard for non-scientific writers to keep up with the difference between physical possibilities and magic.However, there is also errors of a more creative nature.  First off, I don't think I've ever seen a movie where the narrator kicks in 2 hours into it, and was completely unnecessary.  Then the characters were abnormal in their development.  The boy of the story was mechanical and robotic up until the point where his human mother dumps him in the woods, at which point he suddenly seems to act extreemly human.The teddy bear robot is also mechanical, and then suddenly seems intent on helping the boy.  As well as Joe the lover-bot.... robotic and focused on making women happy... and then suddenly seems intent on helping the boy.And let's not even talk about the character of the creator, who seems to want to find the boy so he can be examined... and then ditches him.  And technically speaking... we could implant GPS chips in dogs to track them... clearly that technology is lost in the future.If the movie had ended after the boy got caught in the loop with the fairy thing, then it would have ended as a sort of tragic pinnochio, and that could have succeeded in my mind.  As a sort of lasting statement about the mystery of consciousness and could we ever become God... but alas... suddenly the aliens showed up.Maybe in the next movie spielberg makes, we can enjoy aliens, AI, dinosaurs and asteroids all rolled into one.Bleh.",A.I.

How long did it last?  Ten hours?  I went into this movie without knowing anything about it.  That is the last time I will be that adventurous. I should have known when I saw Stanley Kubrick's name on the screen to get up and leave but I thought I would give it a chance.  I would have sat through Tomb Raider three more times before watching this again.  I would also choose labor and delivery over sitting through this again.

It was a good sci-fi yarn, first rate acting, first rate special effects, great staging (Spielberg's genius), and a fairly decent point to make. However, the writing (Spielberg's weakness) was a bit weak, the tacked on ending, albeit interesting, was distracting and not well integrated.  Everyone said the movie should have ended 20 minutes earlier at the logical point.  They were right.But all that being said, I did find it enjoyable, thought provoking, and wishing that this possible future of robots had the sense to use the 3 laws of Robotics when then built their ""Mechas""  (Asimov's 3 laws that is....).  All in all I still find Steve Spielberg with all his faults as a movie maker, a master story teller - sitting heads and shoulders above most others.People interested in these kinds of sci-fi tales should be pleased.

With some effort I could, perhaps, match those before me in depth and eloquence. Allow me to be succinct, though.The movie is a masterpiece.The score was one of John Williams' best to date. The man is a genius.Haley Joel Osment was flawless as David. Honestly, if you don't empathize with his character, you won't like this film. His concentration is amazing. I never missed the subtlety or detail in his emotional expression.
Steven Spielberg's direction and vision never ceases to impress me.
Jude Law was thoroughly convincing as a passionate Mecha. I have a greater appreciation for his ability.The attention to detail and multi-layered theming shows just how much thought, insight, and emotion went into this story. Kudos, Kubrick.My only lament is that we live in age where a story like this needs to be told. And what I fear worse is that some of us will never understand the message. People often kill the messanger when they don't like the message. That's never changed the truth, though.

I would have loved to see the concept of the film carried to completion by Kubrick, as the dark subject matter and psychological and moral implications in the story seem like something Kubrick could have portrayed exquisitely.AI, as made by Spielberg, though visually stunning and well acted, just feels like it was dumbed down and dressed up to appeal to a broader audience.

I don't buy that. It is not your standard storyline arc, so that may throw some people off.  I haven't read the original story, so I don't know if any part was tacked on.Yes, it belabored the Pinnochio angle, and some of the human characters actions were not internally motivated. The robots were robots however.  I liked that.

I'm not going to describe the movie except to say that it takes place in the future after the polar ice caps have melted, and all the shorelines of the world are now under water. Mechas (mechanical humans) are becoming necessary to keep the industrial world alive.
There is a definite mixture of dark and gloomy feelings being mixed in with some uplifting feelings.  I think Kubrick realized this when visualizing the film and that is why he picked Spielberg to do this film, although I will say there is maybe a little too much of an uplifting feeling in a few places, but for the most part I think it is right on.  The film is deliberately paced and intensely interesting throughout.  From the beginning the film kept me guessing at what's going to come next, with each character and situation that is introduced.  The script is excellent and the acting is superb especially the job that Haley Joel Osment, who is spectacular as the mecha boy, and the mother (Frances O'Conner)also brings a sense of desperation and confusion to her role very well.  The score, by John Williams, is everything that has come to be expected from the composer. It does a wonderful job of enhancing the movie, and also helps keep the pace from feeling stale.  The film not only studies the thoughts and emotions of humans, but also looks to the future of technology and tries to decipher the feelings and emotions that might be possible with artificial intelligence.
I also liked very much how Kubrick with his ideas throws a slight change to what the viewer would normally expect.  In this movie, he has taken the heart out of the humans.  While adding feeling to a movie that could have easily gone emotionless (which he has done wonderfully in other movies) he gives the robots the hearts and feelings.  By doing this he shows how in certain circumstances one might see these robots as more human than the actual humans are.  The combination of the character studies between these two ""races"" mixes with top notch special effects and visual grandeur to provide the viewer with a very attractive and interesting movie.  As 2001: A Space Odyssey made us look at the different ideas of intelligence and loyalty, and the importance of how those ideas interact, this movie makes us look at what artificial vs. real really means.

As a mother and woman, David's character was not over acted, in fact, I wish someone had warned me of the emotional impact I was to experience. This film is beautiful, disturbing, AND visionary. Some sequences are too long, but if you read into the subtext of the plot and the humanity or lack there of in the humans) it is fodder for much soul searching and discussion.  With the same conundrum regarding sanction beings that a STNG episode provided, and the desire to be human as displayed in David Ducovney's X-Files episode ""The Unnatural"", this film is the pinnacle of what sci fi needs to aspire to.Kudos to the actors, Kubrick and Speilberg.",A.I.

1523,gotterdammerung,Cinematic Poetry,10,17 September 2001,"I'm a Kubrick fan. Yes, I think that E.T. was a simple childish movie. And not, I didn't cry when E.T. almost dies (30 years now, so I was 12 in that time). As a child, I first came in love with Spielberg movies before appreciating Kubrick ones; specifically Close Encounters in 1979. But later, when I first saw 2001 and then A Clockwork Orange on video I was just engaged in the Kubrick works. Spielberg always made me be interested in his projects, but from that point in time I always saw in him some kind of genius of the entertainment industry, not an artist in the full sense of the word. When I first heard the rumor that he was going to be the director for AI (when Kubrick passed away), my first feeling was of disbelief. But, I was wrong. Spielberg really has created the most beautiful, uncompromised and bravest of his works. I have been reading all this bashing around AI, but I have been noted too that most of this bashing comes from the hardcore Spielberg fans and those victims of the wrong media campaign for this movie. Spielberg really put poetry in this work, and like the awesome art piece that is, is up to anybodies interpretations, I feel that this is why this movie has gathered so many mixed critics reviews too (from 2 to 5 stars). I feel now that Kubrick was not wrong in choosing Spielberg for directing this work, Kubrick was conscious of being not able to give the perfect sensibility to this film (that he told Spielberg to direct it), Kubrick's wish was to create a Fairy Tale for his adult public and I think that Spielberg really accomplished this purpose in a form of a beautiful poem that can be appreciated in multiple ways. For the end bashers: The end is a Kubrick idea, only subtle differences from the original intended, the main idea is there, and is a beautiful bittersweet coda in Spielberg's hands.",A.I.

1524,hatter10_6,Powerfully personal,10,21 September 2001,"Although I am not a fan of Spielberg or Kubrick, I would definitely name this film as the first masterpiece of the twenty-first century. No film before it has comparable strength, and probably no film after it will be able to duplicate its power. The story described a robotic boy's unconditional love for his human mother, and his sacrifices on a determined journey to become real, so that he could be loved in return.  It was Pinocchio in reality, told by Kubrick, almost in Sadism.  Fortunately, there was more to the story.  His adventure, lead by Spielberg, explored issues of morality, individuality, and ventured into realms of social commentary.  The satisfying ending was neither tragedy nor comedy, but a stroke of genius that required some reflection on the audience's part. Although the movie was more than two hours long, it certainly did not feel so.  If anything, it felt a little bit on the short side (even after, my three viewings).  Spielberg had painted a visually stunning and credible futuristic world that seemed larger that what you see on the screen.  It felt as if the initial family drama, the subsequent adventure, and the development of the Gigolo Joe (Jude Law) demand further exploration.  Rumor has it that a four-hour DVD is to be released.  I will not hesitate to buy it. I could understand the public's polarized perception of this film. As a psychologist in training, I found the film incredibly introspective.  It was so personal that some people would find it difficult to confront.  The message delivered was so complex that some people would not be able to comprehend.  I believe Spielberg had the opportunity to make the film into another E.T., and sell it like another Jurassic Park.  The fact that he didn't make it into a soppy Hollywood crowd-pleaser is what made this film great.  Compared to Artificial Intelligence, all the movies before it about technology and humanity seemed childish.",A.I. Artificial Intelligence

I've seen this in cinema in 2001 and two months ago I have received the DVD as a gift. I now have a kid and the effect of reviewing the film was powerful. Being painful may provoke frustration, but that doesn't mean the film is not awesome. The ""sentient robot"" idea was explored in a series of other movies, but this offers a unique perspective.

1527,rohloff,Spielbergs emotion play mixed with wanna-be action ugh :-(,2,21 September 2001,"First of all I have to admit that I don't like Spielbergs movies very much any more. (I did like them when I was younger...)I basically don't like the way he tries to build up scenes which try to make you think ""Ohhh what a poor child/tragic moment"" etc.When I saw the trailers of the movie I thought that this film might be an action film combined with an intelligent plot... What a disappointment! (And don't think that I only like action films... in fact I like comedy and romance at least as much perhaps even more.)(Spoilers ahead) As someone else wrote, the film could be divided in four ""sections"":1. Child robot David acts as replacement for lost son2. David experiences ""Flesh Fair""3. David searches for ""Blue Fairy"" to become human4. David is found 2000 years later by androids which look like stereotype aliens...If you think this somehow doesn't fit together you are right - it doesn't! I didn't stop the time but section 2 and 3 together felt like 30 minutes and section 1 and 4 together like 2 hours!Section 1 is all about Spielbergs typical emotion play, leading to those really awkward ""Ohh poor boy scenes"" which I really don't like. But during this section I thought ""Ok maybe we need this to understand the robot/mom relationship for the rest of the plot""Section 2 becomes almost an action packed gore festival. (Well not really; there's no blood when you ""kill"" robots) I think everyone who likes Section 1 should find Section 2 quite unlikeable and vice versa. But of COURSE it has to include some more emotion play... (All the people see the errors of their ways, when a robot which looks _like an innocent boy!!!_ shall be killed)Section 3 got really on my nerves... Just because a robot is a ""child"" doesn't necessarily mean that it (the robot remember ?) is stupid. The same is true for his love to his ""mother""... This shouldn't render him incapable of any kind of logical thinking. (The prof who constructed him, later claims that this is exactly why he is so proud... That this kind of behaviour is exactly what makes David so ""human""... Oh my god what nonsense!)Section 4 Well I really didn't expect that! I thought the movie would end when David was trapped under the sea just in front of a Disney-Land-like fairy. But no... we can't let it end here we HAVE to somehow put in more absolutely unnecessary, inconsistent and pointless emotionplay from Spielberg... The androids have to feel lots of pity for the ""lost child"" and of course they resurrect david's mom (for what ?) so that he can have a last day with her, after which she won't wake up anyway.Oh my god what completely unnecessary and _stupid_ ending!BTW: I really like robot stories by Asimov.

There were glimpses throughout the first hour or so which showed what a good film it could have been and the deep questions that it wanted to try and answer. Sadly though overall it falls down badly and appears clumsily handled. The acting is variable, Joel Haley Osmont is excellent and Jude Law is pretty good but I thought the parents were just average, though not helped by a script/direction that seemed to want to rush through the opening scenes. The last half an hour or so is just unspeakably bad, Kubrick must be spinning in his grave, the very worst of Spielberg dross fantasy and a sickly sweet saccharine ending. I came very close to walking out, it's that bad, one of the worst film endings I've ever seen.

1532,david-chapman,A Masterpiece,10,4 October 2001,"Oh wow! Never in my life have I seen a film quite like this one. It leaves you pondering such weighty issues as the nature of love, humanity, technology, existence. Before this puts you off I must add that it asks these questions without the pretensions of an art house movie. Rather, it is a film that does not demand too much of the viewer to enjoy on the surface, but reveals itself when one starts to look deeper, starts thinking about what one has just experienced.The generally negative reception of this film from the public is probably due in part to a misleading publicity campaign - the trailer paints the film as a nightmarish 'dark-future' action film, somewhere in the realm of Blade Runner. What the audience was given was an emotionally driven piece of drama, and a phenomenal one at that.There is also a large contingent of people who deride the film as Spielbergian schmaltz. They accuse him of perverting the original intentions of Stanley Kubrick, and applying a sickly sweet veneer to what should have been a substantially darker, more disturbing piece. They seem to be unaware of the fact that Mr. Kubrick approached Mr. Spielberg to make the movie years ago, because he felt that his style of filmmaking would not suit this project, and that a more positive approach would be more appropriate.Of course, most of these people will never accept that anything remotely connected to the mainstream could have any value...What I am saying is that you should take a chance and go and see this movie.

Even sci-fi novels from the 30s-50s have a far better understanding and analysis of the human-android relations. The issues touched in this movie only scratch most issues, this movie is not ahead from its time it's far behind. It doesn't even consider the issue of consciousness (!), an issue so much discussed in science fiction books of the last century, specially after the establishment of modern psychological theories... Ok the robot shows or emulates feelings, but as far as I understood it doesn't have any awareness of its feelings. So how can you sympathize with such a movie character? And on top of those problems, the movie is separated in three parts. The third one was really unnecessary and separated from the other two, giving me the impression that it was put there just to satisfy the children-viewers.There is also no comparison with Kubricks' ""Space Odyssey"".

For now, those who like this movie (like me) were deeply moved and mesmerised by the story of David, an artificial boy who goes on a quest of self-discovery. From the outset, the scenes that unfold are darkly beautiful, from David's first appearance, to the Moon Balloon, to the far future ending. Almost every scene was uniquely imaginative, showing us things we have not seen in the movies before. Does David truly feel love, is he sentient and self aware? Even if he is not, does his foster mother really have the right to abandon him? Is that all we humans are, fickle, selfish, and in need of emotional massages until things become too uncomfortable? It raises a lot of questions, and makes you think while it unfurls the gorgeous imagry. Try not to feel sad for the nanny Mecha as she is mutilated for the entertainment of the trailer trash at the Flesh Fair; her final smile to David will haunt you. Moreso is Haley Osment as David -- his performance is astounding. You do believe he is artificial, but at the same time you care for him.

1541,Detri,The incredible unblinking boy saves the day.,9,12 November 2001,"I thought this was a very good movie, if a bit on the choppy side. Choppy? I mean that the film is divided into three sections, the first Spielberg family-type warmth with the Pinocchio theme running its Disney music and childhood trauma everywhere, the second a Kubrick dark violent city of sex and mob mentality, the third a rather drugged out mixture with a very odd conclusion. Haley Joel Osment is so wonderful, so inhuman yet human yet... not. The first section: My favorite part here was where he almost drowns the bratty son and is left in the pool and his face while the camera fades out. I love this kid. He doesn't blink, and he's insanely devoted to Mommy Dearest, an Oedipus in the making. The dad is a milquetoast while their son is pleasantly nasty. This whole part is a love filled, yet depressing family (read: soap opera). Haley Joel Osment's acting thankfully saves this section from sappiness. The second section: I kept thinking 'Don't kill off Jude Law!' The sex city was pleasantly dark and Flesh Fair a nice little bit of sadism. This whole part was good and enjoyable. Especially Flesh Fair. That's the part that on tape I'd rewind and watch a million times on VHS (hint: buy it). The third section: A bit of a let down in comparison. Gigolo Joe went away without a second thought and David... well the whole scene where he gets angry is one to be treasured. It also adds to his personality. Before, he was a non-violent, dependent, naive, Oedipal boy. Let's add a bit of anger management problems and a little uniqueness bug. Isn't he cute? The whole bit is wishy-washy and Wonderland-esque. It's also rather sad.All in all, saved by the actors, especially Haley and Jude Law, who managed to pull it off quite wonderfully.

But he didn't have the BALLS to really portray the vision that Stanley would have lushly filmed.  A.I. was so kid-friendly, and so readily huggable, I wanted to puke-up E.T. figurines. Spielberg aspired to make a film that Kubrick would have created. But instead, he repeated his own formula of pablum, in a disorganized homage.  The film screams ""Art House"", but ultimately, is utterly unwilling to risk displeasing the public with nudity, vulgarity, or, God forbid, an ending that ""didn't test well.""

If you have to watch this, and have the good fortune to do so on video, the 'fast forward' button can reduce the amount of gratuitous hatred and violence.  Trying to outdo ""Clockwork Orange,"" or reset it with children?  There were four parts in the first half that persuaded my wife to quit watching altogether, and myself to watch the second half almost entirely in fast forward: 1. The hatred of the 'real' Martin for the 'mecha' David 2. The 'Snow White' scene where the mother abandons David in the woods. 3. The subsequent meeting with the homeless 'mechas' 4. The subsequent cruelty and violence at the 'Flesh Fair.' There seem to be enough news stories of parents who hate their own children to the point of seriously injuring or killing them, and raw unshakable hatred in many parts of the world, paying to watch it for 'entertainment' was for us, pointless.

Then we get attacked with a scene about robots with feelings and their invdividuality, for the life of me I can't understand where that came from. and then the world freezes over and we get a movie about aliens (what the heck is that supposed to be???).Finally the happy ending (soon we can go home!).

The only character I actually liked was Teddy, for being the far most intelligent.Extremely idiotic plot devices. I won't bother with the physical explanations given; people who actually think this in in any ways ""scientific"" surely also believe that ""X-Files"" is a documentary (nothing against ""X-Files""). No, it's generally...whenever the movie gets at a point where it is not predictable what's happening next (which occurs quite often, too), the writers come up with something so *extremely* far-fetched and ridiculous that I was actually wondering if they've written that while taking LSD. The ""Moon"", for example, gave me a really hard laugh...I couldn't believe this was meant serious!Incredibly stupid, overly long, we-need-to-force-some-meaning-in-there, pathetic, ridiculously sentimental ending.

Why not give David back, he is just a robot, instead of horrifyingly dropping him off into a forest?

All scenes carry on for at least twice as long as they need to be... for instance we see about 30 seconds of a robot slowly turning her head sideways so we can see her face has nothing behind it, the moral equivalent to a knife being thrown at the audience in a Three Stooges 3D movie (the entire move is shot like this).There's only one way to partially redeem the movie, and that is by ending it after David sees hundreds of copies of himself and goes mad because he's just a machine, not special at all in any way, and jumps into the water to die. The end. The moral being that if you aren't unique there's no reason to even be. That would have been passable as a movie, but Spielberg doesn't have the balls to not have a feel-good ending. Everything after David jumps into the water is complete hogwash to force a feel-good ending on a movie that should not have one.The fundamental problem with this movie is that this should have been a very dark movie. Robots becoming as smart or smarter than humans, what would really happen without a Three Laws. The obviously Kubric parts are all about this. But back to the fundamental problem... Spielberg clearly just is not capable or doesn't choose to make an actual serious dark movie. Can you think of any movie of his that doesn't end on a high note? Even Schindler's... that's pretty much the darkest movie he's made, and it's really not, it's about hope and saving people in a terrible situation, and ends with rescue.

Thank God, the poor man was spared a direct connection with this sentimental misfire.Why is it that obscenely gorgeous and talented Jude Law can't begin to evoke the eroticism that a similarly cast `love unit' played by the gorgeous but distinctly untalented Daryl Hannah did as Priss of the killer thighs in ""Blade Runner""?  Why is it that cute (and well-cast as a robot) little Haley Joel Osment is incapable of making an audience feel the terror and suffering of not being human that murderous, brutal Rutger Hauer did when he spoke of his memories `I have seen such things'Well possibly because Steven Spielberg is a calculating cynic mascarading as a gooey marshmallow and Ridley Scott is an artist mascarading as a cynic.Among this film's many sins, the one most worth noting is Robin Williams voicing a Yiddische Dr. Know It All.

Practically every Kubrick film was viciously maligned by the masses upon release, and have since found their way on to the ""Greatest Ever"" lists.  Will AI receive the same reverence in years to come?  Maybe, but probably not, Spielberg has made too many (perhaps equally brilliant) digestible crowd-pleasers for it to stand against.Many believe the ending was too out-there, and should have ended in the sombre depths of David's spiritual dissatisfaction.  That is obviously quite reasonable given the impact of that scene, but please consider the following.  A: such an ending would have given everything David had endured previous to that moment no significance, and worse still, would make a statement far too cynical even for a Kubrick film-that the meaning of our lives is to devote ourselves to a futile cause.  I: such a concept (though I may not personally believe in it) already exists as a legitimate scientific theory.  Spielberg doesn't make this stuff up.In all fairness, this film can only relate to certain viewers.  The sexual content (though sparing and correctly contextualised) and the heavy themes make this film inappropriate for children.  The fairy-tale construct and child & teddy dual protagonists could alienate adult viewers.  So who is this movie for?  A: it is for film lovers who appreciate intelligent story-telling.  I: it is for those who can relate to David's quest to discover the meaning of his existence and evolve.

David loves Monica and he attempts to go back to her house with Teddy which is his friend.This movie is considered philosophical point of view.

1590,simiain_82,Brave Spielberg Honors Kubrick By Defying Film-Snobs.,10,28 July 2003,"The loudest opinions with regards to this film have inevitably been from the semi- professional film critic/cynics, sneering about its length and ignorantly slamming it for its supposed 'sell-out' epilogue. As per usual, these people are so busy analysing each frame of the film, that they have entirely missed the point of the story and what Spielberg has set out to do.Lets get this out of the way; Spielberg is not a fool, he is of course going to know that the current fad for 'ambiguity' would not bode well for the wonderfully conclusive (Fairy tales aren't ambiguous) A.I, he would have known that the running time would have impressed neither the critics or the average seat-filler. The fact that he stayed true to his vision despite this knowledge is a testament to his bravery as a director and a screenwriter.In my opinion, Spielberg's two-fingered salute to the current fad of quasi-intellectual porn for quasi-intellectual people (as well as their assumptions as to what a Kubrick film should be) would have delighted Stanley Kubrick.Haley Joel cant really be faulted in a part in which appearing merely functional would be a test for even the greatest of actors and Jude Law revels in his part as a cockney Valentino gigolo.This is a fairy tale; from Ben Kingsley's warm, childlike narrative, to John William's beautifully manipulative music all the way to the wonderfully schmaltzy (and refreshingly absolute) finale.This is a beautiful film....I recommend that if you are an actual lover of story on film (rather than a miserable scrutinizer) then you should watch this.",A.I.

It then dragged on to an entirely different story about a robot who loved his ""mommy"" and who is helped around by a gigolo robot, while trying to find a fairy that would make him real.These three points are what made my mind:-Awful discontinuity in the storyline, with an ending that included amazingly stereotypical aliens and a robot happy forever with his mommy-Amazing capacity to warp one's feelings... I wanted martin's character to be more developed, and i thought we were supposed to feel SORRY for him, he had cancer for Christ's sake, and i finally find out that the poor David is the one we're supposed to ""root"" for. This actually shocked me, in a way that i thought ""how can someone actually feel sorry for a robot that was supposed to replace a child who survived, and then that same robot tries to take the mother's love away from his real counterpart?""-The way it never seemed to end... I mean, this movie had like four possible endings, three of which were ""tragic"" yet bearable. (in all three of them, David dies an honorable death while searching for his mommy or in despair) but our dearest Spielberg had to choose the one with the fancy aliens with TV's in their heads -.-Overall, i ended this movie with a messy mush of feelings in my head, but it's not one of those movies that try to do that (unlike minority report, great movie) it just left me thinking ""what am i supposed to feel, cause all i feel is a deep hatred for David and his mommy, and i'm quite sure Spielberg didn't intend that...""",A.I.

What surprises me about Kubrick fans is the constant use of words like ""chilling, disturbing"" to describe his work. Kubrick's work is nothing more than an honest look into our own humanity, presented to us in an objective setting. It seems to me that the most ""chilling"" thing about his work is our own reluctance to examine with honesty our own human condition. A.I. does this but Speilburg brings in a new element that Kubrick (in my opinion) would never have included in the film: empathy. This seems to me the reason why this project was handed over to Speilburg. As unfinished as the movie was, it is a gift. The visual effects did not disappoint, though some wonder what the movie would have been like under the direction of Kubrick. Haley Joel Osment was spot on with his performance, calling into question his own realness. In the end, after watching this movie, i was left depressed, which is what happens when you fuse the styles of a post-structuralist with a pop movie icon. The effects were far more long lasting and much harder to shrug off than 2001 or A Clockwork Orange (not a measure of goodness by any means) I could go on about how Speilburg didn't understand Kubrick's vision, but someone could write a thesis on that.

It's a different movie entirely, different point, different style. Its only real connection to the Kubrick film is that it lives out the ambivalent messiness that Kubrick was calling us to explore.So, in the Kubrick AI, we don't really know what to do with the robot future. The people and robots don't really mix in the end. And Spielberg doesn't seem to know what to do with the kid any better than his first human parents.

1617,rachitachhaparia,A brilliant movie!,8,24 August 2015,"Artificial Intelligence, directed by Steven Spielberg, revolves around a highly advanced robot who longs to become a 'real' human boy to gain the love of his human mother. It is based on the short story, ""Supertoys Last All Summer Long"" written by Brian Aldiss and also reflects on the story of 'Pinoccio'. Set in the future when the polar ice caps have melted and various cities submerged, the human race begins to make realistic and highly advanced robots, called 'mechas' to serve them. One such mecha, called David, played brilliantly by Haley Joel Osment is created to serve as a substitute for the paralyzed human child of a bereaved mother who is then programmed to love her. However, as the human child, Mike recovers, David gets abandoned by his parents in a forest, left only with the company of a robotic teddy. As described aptly in the movie, ""his love was real, but he was not"" , David gets convinced that the only way to gain acceptance from his mother was to search for the Blue Fairy from the fairy tale 'Pinoccio' who he believed could make him 'real'. Hence, he embarks upon a journey to look for her, fighting against the hostile humans around him. This scientific-fiction with its intriguing plot, brilliant actors and intricate visual effects, keeps the viewers on the edge of their seats right up to the end. Moreover, it poses a philosophical question to the audience about their standards and ethics. The mecha, though an artificial construct, possessed all the feelings demonstrated by a human and was yet, abandoned by his human parents. This makes the viewers contemplate on what responsibility they hold towards the objects they create and if they have the right to destroy it. Moreover, this movie depicts the thin line that exists between humans and the mechanical robots. If the feelings can be equally manifested by a robot as can be done by a human, then does the difference lie only in their composition? If yes, then is that difference enough for us to be justified in assuming the role of their destroyers? With such questions, this movie compels the viewers to re-evaluate their notion of right and wrong which very few movies in this genre have been able to.",A.I. Artificial Intelligence
1618,IMDb-Kilbo,Spielberg directs a Kubrick movie,6,16 October 2015,"Some of the scenes in this movie are pure Kubrick: haunting, lush, and tantalizing.The rest is what you'd expect from a savant blockbuster director who's phoning it in: schmaltz, kitsch, and scenes so engineered to pluck your emotional strings, you wonder if you're watching a movie as a part of a psychology experiment.While this might have been Kubrick's intent, Spielberg takes a potentially rich story and tarnishes it by reminding us that he was the wunderkind director. An example is with his signature car mirror shot as David is abandoned in the forest. By tightly framing him in the small mirror, we're driven to feel like we're abandoning him. A more powerful emotional shot would have been a crane or helicopter shot that has the car leave the frame as the camera pulls up and away from him, leaving him small and alone in the vast forest, centering his abandonment and the object of your emotional connection.This emotional confusion pervades the movie, as the focus continually shifts between the scenes that Kubrick or Spielberg worked on. It's maddening, since there is fertile material here, and I found myself wishing that Kubrick hadn't died during filming and so would have been around to guide Spielberg to a better finished product.It's definitely worth seeing for Kubrickian influence, as long as you keep it firmly planted in your head that this is a Spielberg movie, and not to be taken too seriously.",A.I.

Judging by what Kubrick's other films our like, i am sure that the original draft or idea for this movie was much darker, crude and possibly much funnier and the biggest disappointment is that Spielberg made this movie to light, too much of a fairy tale and he shot a number of scenes in this movie horribly as he tried to be much like Kubrick filming this movie, which is impossible.

Despite some flaws are blatantly seen in the film, the core of the film is heartwarming and truly genuine. The story is a true fantasy for kids and young at hearts. But unlike the premise that it is catered for all, it seems that this movie felt short to accept it in a wider scope of audience. Beyond all of that, it is still a must see. Spielberg proved once again that he has a trademark in directing sci-fi films. The movie conveys a tragic yet a wonderful experience.Jude Law is marvelous as ever. He deserves an Oscar nod for that year, he truly is. His portrayal of a sex robot gigolo was amazing. Law still puts some innocence and vulnerability to Gigolo Joe that reflected throughout the film. In terms of directing, you can see what parts are from Kubrick's and what parts of the movie are from Spielberg's. Kubrick passed away in 1999 and the movie was passed on to Spielberg's. Kubrick's dark comedy and cynical reasoning reflected to it while Spielberg's optimistic and idealistic scenes (especially the ending) gave a poignant feel in the film.A.I. is a total must watch.

It's all about the Luddites fearing human decline with the Rise of the Machines (wasn't that an Arnold flick?). It actually helped, as it cleared the road for the differences between being purely a machine, and a ""human"" machine.

However, I'm gonna be a bit fair and say that it's not all bad, there were some pretty good visual effects, the CGI has been used to some great effect, and the direction from Spielberg was good (as is the norm.). Still I thought this film was terrible and I don't say that about many films. In the words of the ever wise Bart Simpson, ""I can't believe I've found something that both sucks and blows at the same time"".",A.I. Artificial Intelligence
1625,bluebek,THE WORST,1,12 October 2021,This was without a doubt the DUMBEST movie I have ever seen!!! People in the theaters were laughing AT the stupidity. Audience members were talking loud and clear about how awful it was. Almost destroyed my interest in movies altogether.,A.I. Artificial Intelligence
1626,hotjasonwynn,Great Flick! I have seen it 5 times now and well worth it,10,10 November 2005,"Great movie, one of my favorites of all time. Most people don't/won't understand it, but it's a touching movie about society and life among many other things. Love Jude law in this one, adds a great twist to the movie. William Hurt turns in a fantastic performance as well, and Haley Joel Osment gives in my eyes an Oscar worthy performance. I know many will cringe at the thought of this movie deserving any award, but that's why we have these comments, so everyone can say their own peace.Many Kubrick purists don't like the last few minutes of the ending, I can understand why, but at the same time it finds me in tears all the way till the credits finish rolling. It's really too bad Kubrick and Spielberg couldn't conspire on another movie.Looking forward to seeing it again, and if your considering renting it, DO IT!!!!!",A.I. Artificial Intelligence
1627,shihjern,"Stimulating, compelling, moving, touching and entertaining - a classic!",9,3 December 2005,"I just saw the DVD of this movie last night (or rather, this morning!). The ending is a little unbelievable and drawn-out, but the movie is nonetheless excellent for two reasons.First, the very interesting and pertinent themes and issues that it raises: (1) Can human beings ever master sufficiently advanced technology to create 'artificial intelligence' / robots that can simulate human beings (i.e. with feelings, emotions, etc.)? (2) If the answer is 'yes', should human beings create such a robot, for ethical and moral reasons? (3) If the answer is 'yes' again, what obligations do human beings owe this robot with feelings and emotions, i.e. what 'rights' does the robot have?The second reason is of course the spectacular performance by Haley Joel Osment. That boy is really quite an amazing actor. He provides the core of the movie as he undertakes his powerful emotional and physical journey. I have only watched two of his movies ('The Sixth Sense' and this one), and he is seriously brilliant. He captures the character so well; robotic in physical nature, but imbued with human emotions and enduring unconditional love. His facial expressions display such a natural childish innocence and affection, that it is almost impossible to believe that he was acting. A few scenes which particularly impressed me: (1) where he begs his adopted human 'mother' not to leave him in the forest; (2) where he speaks to the 'Blue Fairy' after the 'super robots' excavates him from the ice wreckage; and (3) the closing scene where he hugs his 'mother' before climbing onto the bed next to her, clasping her hand.That boy truly should have won an Oscar for this.It would not be fair if I did not also mention the superb performance of the Teddy Bear (voice by Jack Angel) and the spellbinding musical score by John Williams.All in all, highly recommended. Stimulating, compelling, moving, touching and entertaining - a classic!",A.I. Artificial Intelligence

This movie had potential, but is sadly dragged down by numerous flaws.

1630,banishedtexan86,The beginning of the end,1,25 February 2006,"This is the movie that spelled the beginning of the end for Steven Spielburg who up until this movie was one of the greatest directors alive. The man who brought us Indianna Jones, Saving Private Ryan, and Schindler's List might as well have retired after this movie instead of making Minority Report, War of the World's and Munich. When I first saw the teaser and then the trailer for this movie I could not wait to see it. I felt as if my life depended on seeing, but that was not to be. I tried to find at the library in the small town where I lived, but had no such luck and since I was not working at the time I could not rent it. I ended up not seeing it until some time last year and wished that I never had. Not only was this movie a complete waste of time, but the story was impossible to follow. The writer(s) kept jumping from one subject the next without ever explaining what they had just left. I felt like a tennis ball in the court with the Williams sisters being whacked this way and that. The differences between the robot boy and his real brother was never wrapped up. You were never told why Jude Law's character was set up for murder. The charters were so 2D that you couldn't even get involved with them and you could literally see right through them. Their dialog was tedious and somewhat pointless when they did speak. This is one of those movies like The Thin Red Line where it would have been better to have no words in the movie. You would be much better off watching a silent movie and laughing to death then wasting over two and half hours of your life. If you want to see a good sci-fi movie that has robots in it then watch any of the three Terminator movies, Short Circuit, Star Wars, or if you are desperate Cyborg or if you are really desperate then Hitshhicker's Guide to the Galaxy, but only watch that as a last resort.",A.I.

1631,ttxsushi,Extremely boring,1,18 January 2007,"Confusion will be A.I. epitaph... Nothing to share with Kubrik, this film is a boring patchwork of hi-end sfx and confused storytelling. In the same year, 2001, we had the pleasure to see a restored version of 2001: a space odyssey, that shows the very genius of Stanley Kubrik side by side to the geek-minded film by Spielberg. I don't know how could someone say that A.I. is a Kubrik-style film: to affirm that is to catch the bite for the hook. Yes, the look of the film is very accurate, but the plot has no coherence, and the film itself is too long and without rhythm. This is the same problem that occurs in Schindler's list and Private Ryan: Spielberg is a great and talented director for action film like Duel or Indiana Jones but he's not a great author. Take a look at Kubrik's work or Bergman's or Lars Von Trier's: they know how to use a camera and tell a story. Spielberg knows how to use a camera, but not to tell a story. I'm sorry fans...",A.I.
