0,MartinHafer,A bit different than I remembered....,8,19 March 2017,"I saw ""Magnum Force"" on television decades ago. Imagine my surprise when I watched it again tonight and there were a bunch of stuff that was NOT in the version I saw! Mostly, the gratuitous nudity was cut out of the movie. Now I am not one of these folks who is always against nudity in films...sometimes it has a place. But in this film, it all seems very gratuitous...and one of the MANY folks slaughtered in the pool scene (the topless lady) was a young Suzanne Somers before she became famous.In this story, someone, or some GROUP of folks, is taking out bad folks all around the San Francisco area. Some of the murdered scum- bags are folks that avoided prosecution, some are just dirt-bags who 'need' killing. Inspector Callahan (Clint Eastwood) is the guy determined to solve this case...and his boss, the Lieutenant (Hal Holbrook) seems to want to coddle criminals and stand in Callahan's way. Who the killer(s) are...well, that you'll have to see when you see the film.This movie is pretty much what you expect from a Dirty Harry film...lots of shooting*, mayhem, action and sex. The film certainly earns its R rating and is exciting. I still think the original film is much better but it's a worthy follow-up.*The IMDb trivia says ""This is the only film in the ""Dirty Harry"" series in which Harry doesn't kill any of the villains by shooting them, except the grocery store holdup men."". This is NOT the case, as Harry also shoots a guy in the skyjacking sequence...and he appears quite dead!",Magnum Force
1,bkoganbing,Harry Callahan's Back On The Job,9,2 September 2008,"At the end of Dirty Harry, Clint Eastwood throws a way his badge and ID after ending the life of that evil piece of protoplasm Scorpio. The intention obviously was like High Noon when Gary Cooper just threw away the marshal's badge after killing four Miller brothers, Eastwood was quitting the San Francisco PD.Well he must have thought better of it because Harry Callahan became such an iconic figure that the public wanted him back on the job. So Eastwood made the first of four sequels in Magnum Force.Somebody is doing a great job in reviving the vigilante tradition of San Francisco with a string of assassinations, starting with the opening sequence of a shooting of a labor/racketeer who massacred a rival and his whole family. Shades of the United Mine Worker's Tony Boyle and what he did with Joseph Yablonski. A pimp who murders a prostitute who was withholding on him, there's another massacre at the house of a drug dealer, it's getting open season on criminals.His supervisor Hal Holbrook hates his guts, but there's no one like Harry Callahan for these kinds of cases. Mitchell Ryan who's an old friend of Eastwood plays a cop falling apart at the seams and he looks good for it. And there's a group of four sharp shooting rookies on motorcycle patrol, Tim Matheson, David Soul, Kip Niven, and Robert Urich. Any one of them could be our vigilante. In a way Magnum Force is the polar opposite of Charles Bronson's Death Wish films. Bronson's pretty good at selecting some of the right kind of criminal scum to eradicate, but doing this seems to offend Eastwood although Deity only knows, this has been his game for a long time.There's a nice climatic sequence with an unarmed Eastwood dealing with the responsible party for all of this. Magnum Force is every bit the equal of Dirty Harry in action and violence.In the end as Clint's famous tag line in this film says, it turns out that Dirty Harry was dealing with a man who did not know his limitations.",Magnum Force
2,Leofwine_draca,Hugely influential police thriller and a delight to watch,8,20 August 2016,"This sequel to the popular DIRTY HARRY sees Clint Eastwood reprising the role (he would return another three times) of the tough cop ""Dirty"" Harry Callahan, this time tackling a vigilante bunch of young police officers who decide to rid their city of human waste - namely known criminals who have been set free by the courts. Of course their methods get out of hand, leading to the brutal murder of a policeman and the subsequent hunting by Callahan of the criminals. This is above-average stuff for the genre, full of great action sequences, lots of hard violence, and interesting characters. Clint Eastwood once again makes Callahan his own, an impeccably icy cool cop who's quick with the witty one-liner and who will always get his man.The DIRTY HARRY series in particular seems to be the main one to have influence the Italian ""polizia"" films of the '70s, and this follows a template very much like those - murders and incidents of crime are followed by investigation and a final battle between the good guys and police. And what a battle it is here. From excellent shoot-outs to speedy car chases, MAGNUM FORCE culminates in a fantastic chase sequence in which Harry goes one on three with the corrupt policemen out to kill him, in a well-realised and very violent car chase-cum-shootout episode which just keeps getting better and better, filled with cool stunts and on-the-edge situations.As well as Eastwood, there's a strong supporting cast including Hal Holbrook, excellent as Briggs, a rival with a deadly secret to hide from Harry. Look out for the familiar faces playing the vigilante squad before they were famous: David Soul, Tim Matheson, Kip Niven, and Robert Urich. Felton Perry seems to have been added on in an exploitative note as Harry's black sidekick, and one sequence involving his character is one of the most harrowing in the film. Of course there's also a string of cold-blooded murders for viewers to beware of, including the violent murder of a prostitute by her pimp and his subsequent shooting. MAGNUM FORCE, as the title might suggest, is a film in which guns and firearms figure predominantly - a real macho exercise in crime and the methods used to stop it. A classic in the crime genre which helped to shape the films that followed.",Magnum Force
3,SnoopyStyle,hardcore Dirty Harry,7,2 May 2015,"Mobster Carmine Ricca is released on a technicality. An unknown SFPD motorcycle cop rides up and kills him and his men. Inspector Dirty Harry Calahan (Clint Eastwood) has a new partner Early Smith. He wants in on the job but his superior Lieutenant Neil Briggs (Hal Holbrook) has relegated him to stakeout. While grabbing a bite at the airport, Calahan takes down a couple of hijackers. He runs into old timer cop Charlie McCoy (Mitch Ryan) who complains about the new culture of soft on criminals. He meets four eager rookie cops Phil Sweet (Tim Matheson), John Davis (David Soul), Red Astrachan (Kip Niven) and Mike Grimes (Robert Urich) at the shooting range. The vigilante shoots up a porn movie shoot. It get so bad that even Briggs calls in Calahan.The movie is hardcore Dirty Harry. It's the second in the franchise. There are some good action and good stunts. It gets ridiculous from time to time like the hijackers. The body count is pretty high. Some may object to any perceived message but that's trying a little too hard. Eastwood is still the standard for quiet machismo.",Magnum Force
4,Prismark10,Can you feel the force,8,20 July 2015,"Oh no, it is my television heroes as the bad guys. This view was probably echoed around the country when Magnum Force was first shown on British television in the early 1980s as it inferred that David Soul from Starsky & Hutch and Robert Urich from Vegas could be vigilante cops.Magnum Force is the first sequel to Dirty Harry. Clint Eastwood reprises his iconic role as the no nonsense San Francisco detective Harry Callahan. Eastwood was mindful of the criticism levelled at his character that he was a vigilante cop and this film was a response that labelling Harry as a vigilante is misconceived. Clint Eastwood always maintained that the Harry was critical of organisations and the bureaucracy that they carried. They simply would not let police to their jobs, possibly reflecting Eastwood's own libertarian views.In fact the plot really can be distilled to two people's views of organisations. Harry and his abrasive boss Lt Briggs (Hal Holbrook) on the face of it the anti-Dirty Harry, the cop who has never pulled a gun in the line of duty. Harry knows the system is broken but works within it. He might edge close to the line, even slightly cross it (which he seemed to have done in Dirty Harry) but respects the rule of law even if its only grudgingly. It looks like Briggs also realises that the justice system is broken but has a different solution.Watching Magnum Force again almost three decades later I expected the film to have aged. It certainly has a different depiction of San Francisco than the more tourist friendly picture postcard setting you get these days. Even the crooked segment of Lombard Street does not look like that anymore. What is striking though is the how action packed the film is, its absolutely modernist. I would say that this might be the precursor to the 1980s action thrillers.There was a time in action films where things moved slowly, you established settings, character and there would be a lull in between action scenes where you have quieter moments. Just look at Steve McQueen's Bullitt made a few years earlier and also set in San Francisco.In Magnum Force things are happening all the time. Bad guys getting bumped off by someone dressed up as a cop in a motorcycle. When we see Harry he gets into action pretty quickly as well, dressing up as a pilot to deal with a plane hijacking, later on we see him on a stakeout when a store is held up. The film is very well paced with incidents and action at regular intervals. Credit for that has to go to the writers more than the director Ted Post in my opinion.The film was written by Michael Cimino and John Milius. Both were the new wave of infant terrible of 1970s cinema which also included Scorsese, Spielberg , Coppola and De Palma. John Milius has always been a gun nut with a fascination with the military. He is regarded as the most right wing person in Hollywood. A film critic once said that's like calling someone out for being the tallest player in a professional basketball team!Cimino would go on to work with Eastwood the following year in Thunderbolt & Lightfoot which he wrote and directed. Cimino would achieve acclaim with The Deer Hunter and infamy through his follow up film, Heaven's Gate. He has not directed a feature film since 1996. There have been rumours he now lives life as a woman. What is true is that he has had a lot of bad plastic surgery.The film is called Magnum Force but during the climax notice that Harry dispatches the villains without once resorting to his gun. This is deliberate, Eastwood wanted to show Harry was more than a cop with a big gun that he had guile. It also reinforces the anti- vigilante message of the film. The ending is a little drawn out for my liking.One other thing about Harry in this film was sex appeal. Maybe he should be called X rated Harry as women just keep falling for him. Eastwood in his Dollar trilogy films was never into the ladies. That came in the movies in the 1970s which the star exploited as Eastwood became something of a sex symbol. I am sure it was also an ego thing on the part of Eastwood. It was the only thing that was odd about it, the Harry of Dirty Harry never seemed to have the social skills of being such a womaniser.The film is different in tone and style from Dirty Harry which is the best of the bunch. Magnum Force is a very good sequel and much better than the ones that followed.",Magnum Force
5,kosmasp,Character in Force,8,24 June 2020,"The weapon (gun) was as much a character of Dirty Harry as Harry Callahan himself. And while the man he made the very (in)famous ""Do you feel lucky? Well do ya, punk?"" speech to first (if you watched the first movie, you know he made that speech twice), seems to be a constant in the Dirty Harry movies, it's only Clint Eastwoods character who is the real constant in the movies. And the character name is not even in the title of the sequels ... weird? I'd say so, but then again what do I know? Apparently not as much as those marketing the movies.Now all that aside, one of the biggest criticisms, even back then, was how Harry was portrayed or what he might stand for. Judge, Jury and Executioner! So this takes that theme and shows us what that might spawn in certain police circles. And apart from taking that point apart, it shows a more human side to Harry too. It also tackles a sexism/homophobic threat that some might have seen in the first movie. In a joke Callahan makes it clear, he doesn't care about peoples sexuality - as long as they are efficient and do a great job, they can have any sexual preference they want.That may not fit the ""Republican"" flair many attest the character might have. Generaly speaking this was not made to be a political figure. It was made to be anything but that. Dirty Harry is his name, but ""dirty cop"" he ain't. Which others have to learn - even when the filmmaker involved in this, may have other thoughts in his commentary to the movie ... and while there is no real connection to the first one, I'd suggest watching them in the order they came out. There is progression that can be seen - even if only slight ones sometimes",Magnum Force
6,classicsoncall,"""A good man always knows his limitations.""",7,18 May 2021,"Clint Eastwood reprises his role as San Francisco police detective Harry Callahan in this sequel to the original ""Dirty Harry"". If you have a taste for criminals getting their due, you'll find a lot to like in this story, as Callahan's instincts put him on the trail of dirty cops who fancy themselves as judge, jury and executioner in their haste to dispatch the city's bad guys. A minor twist you can probably see coming has Harry's boss, Lieutenant Briggs (Hal Holbrook), as the leader of the rogue motorcycle cops who pretty much lets them decide on their own targets. The scene in which one of them guns down an entire swimming pool party was probably a wrong headed move in as much as there were probably some innocent guests in attendance, but it didn't seem to concern anyone investigating. Callahan's early statement about a man knowing his limitations is repeated a couple more times throughout the story, and sets up the final curtain for Briggs when Harry sets a timer on a bomb he discovered in his mail box. Oddly, of the four rookie cops who made up the ad hoc assassination team, Harry managed to take out three of them without firing a shot. He ran into one on a motorcycle with a car, pounded the crap out of a second, and managed somehow to have the third one careen off a parking deck into the bay. I found it interesting that three of the rogue policemen wound up portraying good guy lawmen in TV shows during their careers, David Soul in the Seventies series 'Starsky and Hutch', Robert Urich as a member of 'S. W. A. T.' in the Eighties, and Tim Matheson as a sheriff in the 'Wolf Lake' series in 2001-2002.",Magnum Force
7,jboothmillard,Magnum Force,5,5 July 2009,"Dirty Harry was a fantastic crime thriller, and even though this follow-up isn't as gripping, it certainly isn't terrible. Basically San Francisco detective Insp. 'Dirty' Harry Callahan (Clint Eastwood) is this time on the hunt for some killers who are murdering not innocent good people, but many major criminals, e.g. mafia, drug dealers, pimps, and these killers are in fact vigilante motorbike riding cops. There is not much more to say, other than there are one or two chases, a bomb disabling and explosion, and three expected deaths at the end. Also starring Hal Holbrook as Lt. Neil Briggs, Felton Perry as Insp. Early Smith, Mitchell 'Mitch' Ryan as Officer Charlie McCoy, David Soul as Officer John Davis, Tim Matheson as Officer Phil Sweet, Robert Urich as Officer Mike Grimes and Kip Niven as Officer Red Astrachan. The performance by Eastwood is still fine, and there are one or two moments to catch your eye, but I can't say this is just as good or better than the predecessor. Clint Eastwood was number 18 on The 100 Greatest Movie Stars, and he was number 61 on The 100 Greatest Pop Culture Icons, and Harry Callahan was number 17 on 100 Years, 100 Heroes & Villains. Worth watching!",Magnum Force
8,Woodyanders,Even Dirty Harry has his limits when it comes to bending the law,8,19 March 2017,"Maverick detective Harry Callahan (smoothly played by the ever-cool Clint Eastwood) faces off against a gang of rookie cops who are killing criminals that the flawed system has allowed to get away with their heinous misdeeds.Director Ted Post relates the engrossing story at a steady pace, maintains a pretty harsh'n'gritty tone throughout, and stages the rousing action sequences with skill and flair. The smart and trenchant script by John Milius and Michael Cimino takes a strong stance against the abuse of authority and states a powerful central point on how vigilantism opens up a can of moral worms that's more trouble than what it's worth. The sound acting by the sturdy cast keeps this film on track: Hal Holbrook as fed-up disapproving superior Lt. Briggs, Felton Perry as easygoing partner Early Smith, Mitchell Ryan as bitter burnt-out veteran patrolman McCoy, and John Mitchum as the cynical DiGiorgio. David Soul, Tim Matheson, Kip Niven, and Robert Urich are quite good as the eager rookie motorcycle cops who take the law into their own hands. The fetching Adele Yoshioka makes a nice impression as alluring hot to trot neighbor Sunny. The startling moments of brutal violence pack a fierce punch. Frank Stanley's crisp widescreen cinematography provides a pleasing polished look. Lalo Schifrin's funky-throbbing score hits the right-on groovy spot. A satisfying sequel to the excellent original.",Magnum Force
9,rmax304823,"It Is Big, Therefore I Am.",5,18 September 2010,"This can't help but be interesting. Dirty Harry was an engagingly tight-lipped character and the film was gorgeously shot in a gorgeous location, a right-wing wet dream. And, man, his gun was big.Dirty Harry and his gun soldier on, but this is craftsmanship without heart. It's no longer original, and it's done as if by numbers.Harry Callahan now works for Lt. Briggs (Holbrook) in homicide, and has a friend who is bent so far he's just about to break (Mitch Ryan). Four rookie traffic cops who carry .357 magnums can evidently outshoot Harry (!). And Harry gets a proposition from a friend's wife, which he turns down, and an enthusiastic proposal from a pretty Japanese neighbor, which he doesn't. His partner from the first film, Chico, is now teaching college and Harry is burdened with another minority partner, the African-American Felton Perry, who is there chiefly so that Harry can tell him (that is, the audience) about what's going on. He does not survive. The reason Felton Perry must be blown apart with a stick of celery in his mouth is that it's been decreed that the body count must be kept high.There are only two points worth making. One is that ""Dirty Harry"" was nailed by critics and by the public (who attended in droves) for being a Fascist fantasy, which it was. So now Harry must redeem himself by upholding the jurisprudential system in the face of an assault by an internal death squad that is intent on killing all the evildoers in San Francisco. The movie is a jab to the jaw of liberal critics.The second point is that there is no longer any poetry is this carefully constructed and successful piece of junk. The movie knows precisely where it wants to go and it gets there efficiently and without imagination.One of the more celebrated aspects of the original film was Harry's .44 magnum. Everyone was thrilled by that huge cannon Harry carted about. Therefore -- knowing this -- the film's credits roll over a static shot of a monster magnum being held against a blood-red background. The shot of the fist holding the gun seems to go on forever. Maybe it will. But -- no! As the credits end, the fist twists the barrel of the cannon towards the audience -- and SHOOTS.Well, what are we to make of this? We -- the audience, guilty of nothing more than stealing an occasional ash tray from a fancy Las Vegas motel? Or a towel from the beach at Waikiki? Oh, maybe a little cheating on our income tax return, but everyone does that. And the closet full of pantyhose is nothing more than a hobby, a collection, rather like a stamp collection except a bit more, well, exciting.What we are obviously supposed to make of that opening is that the folks who are bringing you this Grand Guignol don't care whether you're guilty of anything or not. They know you've come to the theater to see Harry wield his big gun, and they give it to you -- in your face. The gun wins the award for best supporting actor.In case that opening isn't enough, Ted Post, the director, gives you three shots of men loading their revolvers with the camera at ground level and the guns being held barrel-downward, pointing towards the lens.One of the things I gave ""Dirty Harry"" credit for was not trying to imitate the inimitable car chase from ""Bullet"" (1968). ""Magnum Force"" tries to rectify that error. A motorcycle chases a car down Vermont, the twistiest little street in the city, bar none. There are multiple crashes, a car explodes in a fireball, dead bodies (faceless and otherwise) abound, a pretty prostitute is made to drink a can of Drano and the camera shoots the scene from between her wildly waving legs. Whatever elements ground the original in reality are thrown away here in favor of cheap fantasy, a pandering of the worst sort.It probably looks pretty tame today. We ought to ask ourselves what that tells us about our vernacular culture.",Magnum Force
10,Tweekums,Harry is back... magnum blazing!,8,19 July 2009,"Dirty Harry is back and this time he is after a vigilante who is knocking off San Francisco's low life while dressed as a traffic cop. Harry must find out if it is an imposter, a rogue cop or in fact a small group of cops who have taken it on themselves to become judge, jury and executioner.The film opens with a murderer walking free on a technicality, he isn't free for long though as he is stopped by a highway patrol officer who executes him along with the other people in the car. At first it seems to the police that it is the work of other gangsters. Harry wants to be put on the case put is refused a transfer back to homicide. He decides to go for a burger at a stall at the airport run by an ex cop. It turns out that his timing is impeccable as he ends up having to prevent a hijacking. As the number of vigilante murders increases Harry is brought back onto the case.While this is going on Harry meets a group of rookie cops when he goes for a bit of pistol practice, to his surprise they are all crack shots who rival Harry's own abilities. At first he is impressed with their skill and dedication but later gets suspicious as they seem to be the first on the scene at the various murders.This film is a lot of fun, containing plenty of of hard hitting action, moments of humour and even a little romance for Harry in the form of a colleague's ex-wife and his Japanese neighbour. Clint continues to impress in the lead role, David Soul did well as one of the rookies and Hal Holbrook was suitably officious as Harry's by-the-book boss. If you liked the first film I'm sure you will enjoy this one too.",Magnum Force
11,ma-cortes,Intriguing and lots of action Eastwood's second Dirty Harry outing,7,21 January 2009,"This time Harry Callahan(Eastwood) attempts to detain a vicious killers are murdering mobsters and criminals.The rock-hard inspector is accompanied by an African-American cop(Felton Perry) and they track down a suspects P.D.(Robert Urich,Tim Matheson, Mitchell Ryan).The killers band sees outlaws freed on legal technicalities and they take justice into their own hands.Harry aware a secret gang which administers justice extra-legally and take revenge. Harry is called on once again and wielding a Magnum 44 revolver, he returns his unorthodox means;taking on ominous avengers group that is threatening the city of San Francisco. Harry in trouble as habitual with his chiefs(Hal Holbrook) because his methods lead abuse the criminal's civil rights and a pile of death in clod blood along his wake.Harry pursues the revenge-obsessed murderers and encounters he has more in common with them than he expected.Eastwood's second Dirty Harry entry is well written by John Milius and Michael Cimino; it packs tension,violence, action-filled and is really effective. Although less exciting than ¨Dirty Harry(1971,by Don Siegel with Reni Santoni, Andrew Robinson) but still interesting and plenty of vivid action and suspenseful. However this time ,doesn't feature Callahan's classic phrases, such as ¨Do you feel lucky¨ or ¨Go ahead , make me day¨, though he also says some original lines. Good use of locations by cameraman Frank Stanley and adequate musical score by usual Lalo Schifrin. Taut and expert direction by Ted Post and well produced by the usual, Robert Daley. Followed by ¨The enforcer'(1976, by James Fargo with Tyne Daly,Harry Guardino), ¨Sudden impact¨(1983, Eastwood with Sandra Locke)and ¨Dead pool¨(1988,by Buddy Van Horn with Lian Neeson, Jim Carrey).

12,BA_Harrison,Slightly Less Dirty Harry.,7,21 August 2013,"Police thriller Dirty Harry (1971) received a lot of criticism for the apparent right-wing values of its central character Harry Callahan, who was accused of being a prejudiced, fascistic vigilante who considered himself judge, jury and executioner. In Magnum Force, Harry's principles are made much clearer, and as a result, the character appears far less objectionable: he might step outside of the law to get to the bad guys but there are lines that even he will not cross. In his own word 'A man's got to know his limitations'.Helping to make Callahan look like the model of tolerance and moderation are the four rookie motorcycle cops (two of whom are played by a pre-fame David Soul and Robert Urich) who have taken it upon themselves to clean up the city by executing criminals without trial. When Harry rumbles their game, the renegade lawmen present him with an ultimatum: either you're for us or you're against us. No prizes for guessing what his reply is....Magnum Force is a solidly entertaining, action packed movie with plenty of brutal violence, some decent stunts (many performed by Eastwood himself) and a groovy Lalo Schifrin score; however, the watering down of Eastwood's character in order to placate outraged liberals (Callahan is even given a black partner and an Asian girlfriend to show how open-minded he can be) and a plot that lacks the original's gritty sense of realism does mean that the overall movie lacks the (sudden) impact of its predecessor.",Magnum Force
13,moonspinner55,Brutal and bulldozing balderdash...a swaggering fantasy for blood-and-bullets fans,5,19 December 2015,"The second ""Dirty Harry"" film, directed by Ted Post (a friend of star Clint Eastwood's from their days in television), is full of smash-ups, crash-ups, a pimp killing a prostitute with drain cleaner down her throat, a metal girder catching a crime czar right in the face, and a police inspector (Eastwood's partner) dispatched in a shameful manner--by opening a bobby-trapped mailbox! The plot is inverted from 1971's ""Dirty Harry""--this time, the kids are all right and the cops are the bad guys. No matter; Eastwood's Harry Callahan dispatches with the legalities and mows down the crooked rookies just as he did with the hippie sniper from the predecessor. The screenwriters (John Milius and Michael Cimino!) don't even attempt to recognize the irony inherent in the scenario--it's just a plot gimmick to them, another way to go with this character. Still, for fans of completely mindless action fare, one could do worse than ""Magnum Force"". It has built-in audience approval, which is impossible to shake; one goes into the movie knowing exactly what to expect--and enjoying that all expectations are fully met. Post keeps it moving--thumping, thumping--like an erotic dance for would-be assassins. ** from ****",Magnum Force
14,Quinoa1984,"""I hate the damn system, but until someone comes along with changes that make sense, I'll stick with it.""",8,30 August 2005,"I think this sentence, said at a pivotal point in Magnum Force, the second Dirty Harry picture, is one that should get more attention. It says something very basic about Inspector Harry Callahan, and in a sense about the society he's fighting/serving. He has no qualms about putting a bullet right between the eyes of anyone with a pistol meaning business (in this case there are a couple of juicy examples, like early on with a hijacked airplane). But there is a line that he just can't, and won't cross. This is something that I think has some reflection in our world from then and today; many of us get (usually rightfully so) indignation about the criminals of the world who seem to get away with abhorrent, or just plain wrong, crimes. Dirty Harry (Clint Eastwood, still one of his great characters) has become a kind of masculine, hard-as-nails (and as Pauline Kael calls pretty much 'fascist) hero for the period, because he tries to get above the law, while still within its perturbing limits. The other line ""a man's got to know his limitations,"" is also potent, though more of a throwaway to the 'do I feel lucky' speech from the first one.It's themes like these, from a script by John Milius and Michael Cimino, that give the audience something to sort of think about even as the more standard elements of the story run through. This time Harry has to contend with mysterious lot of killings in San Francisco; a corruptible politician and a pimp being two such targets. He also has things on the side with his personal life, but soon the case is taking over for him. There is also the contemptible, and shady, Lieutentant (Hal Holbrook, with a couple of subtleties that work better than expected through the hard-faced scenes), who couldn't care less about Callahan. Amid this there's at least a couple of car chases, shoot-outs, the plane hijacking mentioned before (a highlight), and a supermarket robbery. For those who are gun nuts, some of these scenes will likely be eye-candy.However, compared to the first film and even some of the subsequent sequels, the direction is hit or miss; some shots are creative, but its mostly pretty straightforward (although Eastwood was reported as uncredited as director, it just doesn't pack the wallop Siegel's direction had). And the scenes involving Harry's personal life (i.e. women) aren't very well developed; they're just sort of left hanging as the film focuses on the main plot, even if they're good scenes. Still, through all of this, the ideas working through the story and the script help push it forward to a rewarding and exciting climax. There is a statement being made through all the action and hard talk. And there's that trademark jazz score too.",Magnum Force
15,Coventry,"Slightly ""Cleaner"" Harry",7,24 May 2008,"""Dirty Harry"" was a revolutionary early 70's action movie that instantly caught the attention of cinema-loving (and hating) audiences because of its no-nonsense attitude, excessive depiction of violence and thoroughly nihilistic atmosphere. ""Magnum Force"", the first sequel in the fairly long-running series and released barely two years after the original, is still an excessively violent and nihilistic toned action movie, but unfortunately it hasn't got the same shocking and adrenalin-rushing impact as ""Dirty Harry"". Partially this is normal, since the surprise element has vanished, but especially the subject matter here is far less disturbing (also far more fictional) and even the character of Harry Callahan seems to have softened a little already. ""Magnum Force"" still remains a pretty terrific and highly exciting cop thriller, of course. I never doubted that for a single moment, especially not since the screenplay was penned down by no less than John Millius (""Big Wednesday"", ""Conan the Barbarian"") and Michael Cimino (""The Deer Hunter""). The problem  if you can even call it that  here is that ""Magnum Force"" is only a prototypic action vehicle, whereas ""Dirty Harry"" also served as a contemporary 70's statement to assure the times were rough and flower-power influences were dead, buried and gone forever. Harry apparently picked up his badge again, after throwing it away at the end of the original, since he's still upsetting his superiors by enforcing the law with unorthodox methods. He's called back to the homicide department when the city of San Francisco seems ""plagued"" by a series of killings of prominent gangsters, like drug barons, mafia couriers, pimps and professional hit men. Shortly after they narrowly escaped justice and got acquitted, the criminals' are found barbarically murdered Executed, even. Harry initially suspects one of his closest colleagues struggling with depression, but there are other possibilities as well, like a young and straight-shooting posse of traffic cops. ""Magnum Force"" is exciting, but not exactly suspenseful since director Ted Post never really intends to make the killer's identity a big mystery. The vigilante-massacres are extremely sadistic to behold and especially the irrelevant interludes (Harry single-handedly preventing the hijacking of a plane, Harry brutally sorting out a supermarket heist) are super amusing. Harry Callahan may not be as ""dirty"" as he was in the first film, but Clint Eastwood nevertheless still portrays him as the ultimately cool tough cop. Eastwood also receives support from Hal Holbrook as the grumpy superior and David Soul  who'd later play Hutch in the legendary series ""Starsky and Hutch""  as the younger cop. The soundtrack is excellent and the photography and editing are far more sophisticated as in the first film. There's even a replacement, albeit less memorable, quote for ""Do you feel lucky, punk?""; namely ""A man's got to know his limitations"".",Magnum Force
16,sunwarrior13,Eastwood At Top Form In Magnum Force,10,15 March 2014,"Magnum Force is the second to feature Clint Eastwood as maverick cop Harry Callahan after the film Dirty Harry.

Discovering that all the killings have been committed by the same weapon, Callahan suspects that his partner, Charlie McCoy, is responsible. But the people responsible are far from his suspicion as it happens people that he is familiar with that almost cost him his life as Harry learns at the end.This is definitely a great sequel to the first film.Clint Eastwood was definitely in top form as Harry Callahan.He was definitely a one resourceful cop.It is also worthy to mention as sexy cop as well as many women are willing to sleep with him.LOL The story was also interesting and the violence was definitely intense as we get to see the vigilante group kill a lot of criminals as they put the law into their hands.Aside from that,the identity of the group was definitely a surprise for the viewer.The movie maybe dated in terms of pacing and special effects but it will still manage to entertain especially for both Eastwood and Dirty Harry fans.",Magnum Force

So what to do with ""Magnum Force"" then, the inevitable sequel given ""Dirty Harry's"" popularity? The makers come up with a great idea, have Harry confront a group of vigilantes who believe in his own kill crime ethics, only they take it to the extreme.So begins a trail of blood for Harry to follow which leads him right where we the viewers pretty much knew he was going to end up. Ted Post is no Don Siegel, and although the action and all round testosterone feel that so marked out the ""Dirty Harry"" films is exciting and evident respectively, there's periods where the film meanders. The instances that serve to add more complexity to Harry's make-up is welcome, but aside from a jumping bean turn from Holbrook, the director can't get much out of the rest of the cast, as shame since there's a lot of up and coming talent and stalwarts in the mix.Still, even with some minor and evident problems it's a lively and entertaining sequel (the best of them actually), one that doesn't shy away from pushing some buttons and baiting of critics who had disdain for the first film. The ending is a disappointment, though, but the journey is ultimately meaty and macho. 7.5/10",Magnum Force
19,Theo Robertson,Produced As A Response To Critics,7,14 July 2010,"Despite being viewed as a classic crime thriller nowadays the original film in the DIRTY HARRY franchise received very verbal complaint from critics two of which were by legendary critics Pauline Kael and Rober Ebert described it as being "" Fascist "" . Maybe that's going too far but you have to consider that up till that time Hollywood always divided good and evil in absolutes . With the birth of "" New Hollywood "" in the late 1960s the lines started becoming very blurred . Certainly Harry Callahan doesn't stomp around in jackboots but is torturing confessions out of suspects to be condoned ? Maybe the reason the audience cheered the demise of Scorpio in the original was because it was a good compromise ? Yes shooting suspects caught red handed is certainly justice no matter how rough the liberals may claim it to be It's obvious the makers of MAGNUM FORCE are mindful of this . It's certainly a tough compelling thriller with an interesting premise of cops forming a death squad to liquidate criminal elements in society but often you get the impression characters become literary devices in order to say "" Nope Dirty Harry wasn't a fascist movie and here is the difference ... "" There's slight niggling flaws that stops the film becoming a persuasive film in its own right . It would have been very interesting if Lt Briggs had arrested Harry and how it would have stood up in court . It also begs the question at the end if Harry would have to reveal he's killed the vigilante cops or if he's not going to mention anything on the matter . But these are minor flaws in a film that's the only one in the franchise that comes close to the brilliance of the original",Magnum Force
20,Scarecrow-88,Magnum Force,7,26 November 2010,"""A man's got to know his limitations."" Harry Callahan believes that the ones responsible for a rash of homicides inflicted on the criminal element(mostly massacres with collateral damage, such as junkies and whores, not to mention gangsters' goons)who escape the prosecution of the courts are traffic cops. How to prove this will be difficult, particularly when these motorcycle cops soon threaten his own life.Probably more interesting for the fresh faces of future television stars like the super cool David Soul and Robert Urich(and a really young Tim Matheson)than the rather simple plot which questions the law system and how the worst of criminals are able to remain out of prison on technicalities and lack of evidence. Ted Post is more than capable(he directed Eastwood in the fine western, HANG 'EM HIGH)to take over the directorial reigns from Siegel and gets a chance to stage a nifty chase scene where Eastwood must evade a motorcycle cop on his tail through the outskirts of San Francisco. There's a dandy of a shootout between tipped-off gangsters who operate a drug operation on a pier where Eastwood amazingly hangs on the hood of a speeding car. Hal Holbrook is well cast as Eastwood's nemesis, Lt. Briggs, his superior, proud that he has never removed his gun from his holster. There's a great moment in the movie, rather subtle, which has a certain someone committing a Freudian slip(""they're guilty until..."")which could implicate him to the viewer(if they catch it, that is) as the ringleader of the motorcycle cop gang. There's a lot of bloodshed in this particular film, as Post and company stage several violent set pieces where cops gun down criminals in cold blood. One very disturbing scene features Dirty Harry regular Albert Popwell as a pimp who pours drain cleaner down a struggling prostitutes throat after she attempts to hide money from him, in the back of a taxi cab. Mitch Ryan has a small part as a disgruntled police officer pal of Harry's who is having a hard time accepting that it seems the scum on the streets get a fairer shake than cops..he's blatantly put out there as a possible suspect which most viewers will see right through. This film has the rare occasion where Harry loses at something, a shooting competition where cops compete on an obstacle course, Soul defeating him. Holbrook and Eastwood's tension makes for some great drama, the way they butt heads, and Soul really lands a great part as the leader of the traffic cops, probably considered quite the star vehicle to excel his career..behind Eastwood and Holbrook, of course. The film points out how Callahan is different than the vigilantes of the film meting out their own brand of justice by acknowledging his indifference, but loyalty, to the laws he must adhere to..Callahan must protect and serve, while also defending himself against anyone who discharges their weapon in his direction, threatening his life. That said, Callahan doesn't condone pulling people over(no matter how evil and unlawful)and shooting them on the spot, and this separates him from those who do in MAGNUM FORCE.",Magnum Force
21,preppy-3,"So-so sequel to ""Dirty Harry""",6,2 July 2001,"Interesting plot--a bunch of cops take the law into their own hands and execute those they think deserve it. Good thing Harry Callahan (Clint Eastwood) is on hand to stop them. The original ""Dirty Harry"" had its problems--it was stupid, sadistic and sexist. But it moved quickly and was never dull. This one isn't stupid but it's VERY cruel (the murder of a hooker is particularly sick), sexist (not one positive female character at all and when the hooker is killed, it's shot to turn on the men in the audience) and moves way too slowly and is too long (at least 20 minutes too long). We get a hijacking sequence and a gun shootout contest which are not needed and bring the film to a sceeching halt. Also the extreme violence (car chases, crashes and lots of bloody gunfights) is curiously unexciting. The only fun here is seeing Eastwood and unknowns Tim Matheson, David Soul and Suzanne Somers (blink and you'll miss her) so young and full of energy. Also, the acting is pretty bad...especially Hal Holbrook who walks through his role.",Magnum Force
22,LeonLouisRicci,Badly Produced Badly Executed and Plain Bad,3,29 March 2013,"From the lingering opening ""shot"" of Dirty Harry's .44 Magnum this sequel shows off itself to be little more than less of the same. The Movie is filled with static shots, lame dialog, and is so basically bad that even the production is pedestrian and amateurish looking at times.There are one or two scenes that rise above all the bland and uninteresting, but these can hardly sustain two hours of boring bad ass behavior. Harry is not Dirty Harry anymore. For some reason he has decided to work within the system. Say what? This is unacceptable for our Anti-Hero and is nothing more than a plot convenience to make the bad good guys a target.The almost inconceivable tag line ""a Man's got to know his limitations"" is laugh out loud ludicrous. The violence while strong and bloody lacks any real style and is played straight and stagy. In the end this is a plain and awful looking Film, with grainy, sometimes actually out of focus Photography and signaled what was to come in the rest of the series.",Magnum Force
23,poolandrews,"""Every time you pull out that gun my paper work backs up for three God damned months."" Decent sequel.",6,25 September 2007,"Magnum Force is set in San Francisco where infamous cop Insp. 'Dirty' Harry Callahan (Clint Eastwood) is at loggerheads with his superiors over his unique & brutal brand of law enforcement. Carmine Ricci (Richard Devon) is allowed to walk free after a judge acquits him from a murder charge on a technicality, the triumphant Ricci drives away from the court house a totally free man but a traffic cop pulls his car over & proceeds to shoot dead everyone inside. Then more big name criminals are assassinated & when the innocent get in the way of these rogue killers plans they are scarified for the greater good, Harry is put on the case & quickly comes the the conclusion that there is an organisation within the department who are acting as judge, jury & executioner & killing all of San Francisco's top criminals & Harry sets out to bring them down...Directed by Ted Post, although sources including Eastwwod himself claims that he & second unit director Buddy Van Hoen directed more of the film than Post, this is the second of five Dirty Harry films & I quite liked it & definitely put it above average although I wouldn't call it great or anything. The script by John Millius & Michael Cimino is more of a thriller than a straight action flick & has an interesting premise that is still, perhaps even more so, relevant today as there's barely a news broadcast or edition of a national newspaper that goes by without some sort of criminal getting a ridiculously small sentence (I can remember one here in the UK recently where a convicted paedophile was let off because there were no prison places near where his family lived & the fact that if placed in a prison father away he wouldn't get any visitors & that would be stressful & cruel on him & his family, I kid you not) or an interview with a cop who feel like their hands are tied with petty rules, paper work & laws seemingly geared towards protecting the guilty rather than the innocent. You can see where the character's are coming from in Magnum Force, both the rogue cops & Harry who despite not liking the system understands it's the only one we have so ultimately defends it, it's a decent with a moral message so I'll give it some credit for that alone. Unfortunately it isn't all plain sailing here as I thought the film went on for too long & was simply too slow, it's well past the 50 minute mark before Harry is even put on the case for cryin' out loud & the identity of the rogue killers is far, far too obvious. Basically I felt that Magnum Force was a well written & thought out film which could have used a little tightening up during the editing, this could have been an absolute classic as it is it falls just sort.Director Post does OK, the action is competently handled with the motorbike chase at the end standing out as the best set-piece the film has to offer. I watched a pristine 2:35:1 widescreen print of this last night & for a film shot over 30 years ago back in '73 it sure does look good, if you can please try to watch the widescreen version. There's not much violence here, a few shootings but nothing excessive by todays standards. There's some nudity as well if that sort of thing interests you. I also have to mention the pimp mobile, the big black mother who drives around in a huge pink car with orange tan roof & huge triple exhausts running along the side! Talk about drawing attention to yourself, a stark lesson in how not to be inconspicuous...Technically the film is good, it's well made on location in San Francisco using some of the cities sights as backdrops. The acting is fine, Eastwood is good, David Soul's performance here apparently got him the job as Hutch in the TV series Starsky and Hutch (1975 - 1979) & Hal Holbrook is decent as Harry's long suffering boss.Magnum Force is a good thriller, those looking for out-and-out action may feel a little disappointed so bear that in mind. This was a sequel to Dirty Harry (1971) & was itself followed by a further three sequels, The Enforcer (1976), Sudden Impact (1983) & The Dead Pool (1989) in which Harry finally hung up his 357 Magnum...",Magnum Force
24,writers_reign,Dire Streets,6,30 October 2016,As sequels go this is a tad better than the majority and gives Clint Eastwood a chance to develop his Dirty Harry Callaghan persona. Unlike at least one other person I had no problem with the sequence where Callaghan foils an attempted plane hi-jack. Whilst it's true it has nothing to do with the main plot - finding out who comprise the vigilantes within the department - it reminds us that Harry gets results albeit via unorthodox methods and telegraphs that sooner or later he'll root out the vigilantes. It would have been nicer if Hal Holbrook didn't make it so easy for the audience to catch wise to him but overall it's a satisfying and entertaining divertissment.,Magnum Force
25,utgard14,"""If the rest of you could shoot like them, I wouldn't care if the whole damn department was queer.""",6,6 December 2014,"First sequel to Dirty Harry finds Harry (Clint Eastwood) taking on a group of vigilante cops. Excellent cast includes Hal Holbrook, David Soul, Felton Perry, Tim Matheson, and Robert Urich (his film debut). Suzanne Somers has a brief topless scene at a pool party where one of the vigilantes strikes. Good screenplay by John Milius and Michael Cimino. I like this one but I've always felt it didn't quite live up to its premise, which was very interesting and possibly could have led to it being the best of the series. It just feels like it's a little padded and the climax lacks the punch of the first or third films. It also feels like they threw in some things to soften Harry's image, potentially to make the series more accessible to a wider audience. They aren't things that are necessarily out of character, nor do they damage the movie, but they still feel tacked-on. Also, Harry's big line in this one, ""A man's got to know his limitations"" is less memorable than the ""Do you feel lucky"" speech or ""Go ahead. Make my day.""

27,zardoz-13,"""Magnum Force"" Doesn't Have the Force of ""Dirty Harry.""",7,24 February 2009,"Clint Eastwood reprises his role as Inspector Harry Callahan of the San Francisco Police Department in ""Hang'em High"" director Ted Post's ""Dirty Harry"" sequel ""Magnum Force."" The sturdy cast including Hal Holbrook, David Soul, Robert Ulrich, Tim Matheson, and Mitchell Ryan co-star with the lanky Eastwood and his Model 29 Smith & Wesson revolver. The vigorous John Milius & Michael Cimino screenplay serves to clarify our hero's law & order stance that he took so much flak for in ""Dirty Harry."" Indeed, ""Magnum Force"" whitewashes Eastwood's saintly but insubordinate cop. Remember, in ""Dirty Harry,"" our hero ignored the law when he tried to save the life of a kidnapped girl. Harry's violation of the villain's Miranda rights, however, allowed the fiend to go free despite overwhelming evidence that he was the murderer. In ""Magnum Force,"" we find Harry back on the job. The filmmakers never explain what occurred in the interim, but it really doesn't matter. Harry is back and that is all that counts. Harry encounters a quartet of gung-ho 'young Turk' motorcycle traffic cops who are crack shots with their .357 magnum service revolvers.""Magnum Force"" opens with an angry mob of citizens protesting the release of a mobster Ricca (career character actor villain Richard Devon) and his associates, who want out of court, climb into their automobile and tool off to freedom despite the crowd. They don't get very far before a uniformed traffic cop in black leather with a cream white helmet pulls them over for crossing the double lines on the freeway. When the thug driver gives the cop some lip, the copwho we cannot see because he is virtually anonymous in his regaliawhips out of his service revolver and punches holes in all four of them, leaving them sprawled dead in the car. Harry investigates and his new superior, Lieutenant Neil Briggs (Hal Holbrook of ""The Great White Hope"") chews him out for not being on the stake-out to which he has been assigned. By this time, Harry has acquired a new partner, an African-American (Felton Perry of the original ""Walking Tall"") to show that he isn't a bigot. Harry takes Smith out to airport to grab a hamburger and stumbles onto a hijacking plot. Harry masquerades as an airline pilot to get aboard the jetliner and thwarts the swarthy looking hijackers with a few shots. When Harry gets back to the stake-out at a super market, he nails a couple of gun-toting bandits. Later, a pimp (Albert Popwell who played the bank robber in ""Dirty Harry"" that was on the receiving end of Callahan's speech) corners one of his girls at night and takes a stash of cash that she has been hording. He repays her greedy by pouring drain cleaner down her throat. The next time that we see the pimp he is being pulled over by another traffic cop. He offers the cop a bribe and the cop blows him away. prefer to take the law into their own hands and execute crooks that rely on the loopholes in justice to get out of being prosecuted from their crimes.Ted Post isn't half of the helmer that Don Siegel was, but ""Magnum Force"" pales by comparison with its predecessor. First, despite the presence of some strong villains, the bad guys are rather straightforward types. Nobody is as psychotic as Andy Robinson's Scorpio in ""Dirty Harry."" The antagonists here are well-heeled gangsters with armies of gunmen or slickly dressed motorcycle cops with impenetrable sunglasses that make them look intimidating. All in all, ""Magnum Force"" is rather conventional. Dirty Harry fans would have to wait for ""Sudden Impact"" before the character had another memorable speech. The closest that Milius & Cimino come to a signature line is Harry's comment: ""A man has got to know his limitations."" Otherwise, the dialogue is as disposable as the spent shells that Harry empties from his revolver. The shoot-outs are staged with some competence, and lenser Frank Stanley's camera-work is far about average. There is a major shoot-out between a mob and Harry. Eventually, Harry winds up on the hood of the car being driven by a hood that conveniently loses control of the vehicle and impales himself on a crane. Early in the storyline, Harry stumbles across a career cop and an old friend, Officer Charlie McCoy (Mitchell Ryan of ""High Plains Drifter"") who hates the system almost as much as Harry does and makes no pretense about it. Milius and Cimino use McCoy as the red herring. He appears to be the unhinged cop who has been killing thugs, that is, until he gets killed himself.A little more than half-way through the action, the badguys identify themselves to Harry and ask him to join them. Surprisingly, for them, Harry refuses to and it's only a matter of time before he has to confront them. As it turns out, Harry's worst suspicions have come true. Vigilante cops within the SFPD are knocking off suspected criminals with extreme prejudice. Eventually, Harry has to tangle with them aboard a mothballed aircraft carrier after a brisk but uneventful car chase. The motorcycle stunts come off looking tame.The biggest difference in ""Magnum Force"" from ""Dirty Harry"" is the relationships that Harry has with women. He had no woman in ""Dirty Harry,"" but here we see him date an Asian-American as well as Charlie's ex-wife. Harry never gets them between the sheets because he has to respond to some criminal emergency that cannot wait for him. Interestingly, according to scenarist John Miliusin an above-average but less than satisfactorily complete commentaryrevealed that Eastwood had received mail from women requesting that he work women into the movies, but that the women come onto Harry instead of vice-versa. ""Magnum Force"" packs a lot of heat, but it cannot compare with Don Siegel's original. Hal Holbrook makes an okay villain.",Magnum Force

It's better written and even uses- and handles its main character in a better and more intriguing way.At first it really looks as if this movie is going to be nothing more but just another rehash of the first movie. It seemed to feature a similar type of plot and progressed in almost the exact same manner. However, the further the movie progresses, the more starts to become clear about the story and the direction it's heading at. You think this is going to be yet another movie about a serial killer but there really is far more to the story, as you'll find out.I won't spoil anything but there are some nice twists and turns in the movie, that shake things up. It even makes this a somewhat surprising and also original genre movie.It's really not necessary either to watch the first ""Dirty Harry"" movie before you go and see this one. It's really a movie on its own, with a new story and also mostly new characters in it. All of the events that happened in the first movie are mostly irrelevant for this one and you'll get into this movie and its main characters just as easily as you would when you have already seen the first movie.Compared to the first movie, which was great as well by the way, they had improved on certain things. The character of Harry himself for instance is given some depth and background this time around, making him even more human like and likable. You get a better sense of the character so to speak. The movie also still feels very raw and straightforward. There is some pretty graphic violence in the movie and the Clint Eastwood character Harry Callahan of course isn't afraid to use his Magnum more than once throughout the movie. There is some real good action and some nice thrills in this movie, that all look and feel very typical for an '70's genre production, which is a big compliment of course.There really wasn't much that I didn't liked about the movie. It did everything right, had a great genre story in and of course one iconic main character, who lifts the movie even up to greater heights, also mainly thanks to Eastwood's performance.

He is no longer in homicide where he'd like to be but he's close enough to stick his nose in things.It seems ""Magnum Force"" was made to give the audience a better idea of who Harry Callahan is. Viewers like me believed he was a shoot 'em up, anti-system, judge-jury-and-executioner type cop that only saw laws and due process as a hindrance to good police work. ""Magnum Force"" was an effort to show that Harry Callahan was not that extreme.One, or more than one, S.F.P.D. officer is taking out bad guys. He's doing it in uniform but not in the course of pursuit or any other justified manner. He (or they) are surreptitiously killing criminals that have gotten away with murder. This probably wouldn't offend the sensibilities of a lot of people but the fact is it's illegal, whether you like it or not.The cop vigilante crosses the line when he kills another cop. I say crosses the line only in the sense that now he will be heavily investigated instead of the half-hearted investigations of the dead pimps, pushers, and gangsters.It's all very fascinating because we find Dirty Harry having to pursue another cop. And not just any cop, but a cop that espouses the same beliefs as Harry with the only difference being that Harry stays to the right of the laws even if barely. There's even a line in the movie when the lieutenant reminds Harry that he also hates the broken prosecutorial/judicial system and Harry responds that until someone comes up with a better way, he's going to abide by what's in place.""Magnum Force"" makes Harry more likable, even if just a little bit. A few of you (or more) may be reading this and saying that you always liked Harry. I admit that I didn't. I really saw him as a dangerous cop that was a hair's breadth from killing someone who didn't deserve it. All the indications in the movie ""Dirty Harry"" were that he hated the system and he hated criminals and the system just helped criminals walk free. He made those sentiments clear. To me that adds up to, ""I'll take care of things myself."" Sure, that may work sometimes. It may work most of the time. Dirty Harry may be a man of the best character, keen ability to follow evidence, and more just than any jurist known to man: but that's not the system that's in place and furthermore-what happens when there's a cop not as just, wise, and discerning as Dirty Harry?

When Harry refuses to join the vigilante(s) he becomes an enemy.The five Dirty Harry films are as follows: ""Dirty Harry"" (1971), ""Magnum Force"" (1973), ""The Enforcer"" (1976), ""Sudden Impact"" (1983) and ""The Dead Pool"" (1988).I like all five, but ""Magnum Force"" is my favorite while -- surprisingly -- the first one is my least favorite, probably because the villain, Scorpio, is so annoying and the way he gets away with his crimes via legal loopholes and the idiocy of the authorities and their system is so aggravating (and, yes, I realize that was the point).""Magnum Force"" switches the plot around so that Harry -- albeit still a bit of a loose cannon -- is now fighting against vigilanteism in the force rather than being the quasi-vigilante.What I like best is the eponymous magnum force of a group of mysterious officers. The best scene is when Harry is unexpectedly confronted by this force in the parking garage and Harry comes face to face with what he could've become.This is just a great cop thriller. At the end, one of the villains dies by riding his bike into the bay off a huge carrier. If the movie were remade today this wouldn't do; Harry would have to blow up three ships, the pier, the marina, the buildings and a third of the city.The film runs 124 minutes and was shot in San Francisco.GRADE: A",Magnum Force
37,trashgang,top notch despite the racism,8,7 March 2016,"Part 2 in the Callahan franchise. This is a completely other thing than Dirty Harry and I must say that it doesn't matter at all because it is still top notch. Have seen the Death Wish franchise you could see after part 2 that it went totally wrong but Dirty Harry is still strong. Of course the performance of Clint Eastwood as Callahan is superb. I dare to see that it is even better then his performance in Dirty Harry.The opening credits do say it all, the famous sentence of Dirty Harry is repeated here so you immediately knows what your up to. Just before the end credits there's a new line ""Men got to know it's limitations"". Straight from one of his spaghetti westerns it could come. Being made early seventies it shows in the bad way, there's a lot of racism going on, what was going on back then, but to see it nowadays what they all are saying to the black people is really outdated. also surprised of the nudity added in this action flick. Some full frontal here and there. Still if you can place it in it's time made you will love this, another classic from Clint Eastwood despite some editing faults with the car chase at the end, just watch the car changing with it's damage now and then.Gore 0/5 Nudity 1,5/5 Effects 2/5 Story 3/5 Comedy 0/5",Magnum Force
38,mm-39,violent,7,10 February 2001,"This film broke a few rules in violence when it came out.  The first scene in this film is pretty graphic, and gives the viewer an idea of what to expect.  TBS has to edit this movie extremely.  I like it, not the best acting or script, but the concept is great.  Eastwood is great and is the only one to pull this story off.  The action scenarios have been copied to death, but in 73 it would have been ground breaking.   The feel this movie projects of vigilantism make it a bench mark others have followed.  If imitation is complementary this film is a standard other action films follow.",Magnum Force
39,Mr-Fusion,Doesn't come close to the original,5,31 July 2012,"Clint Eastwood is back in ""Magnum Force"", an overall serviceable sequel to the incredible ""Dirty Harry"". This time around, San Francisco is being stalked by a group of wayward motorcycle cops, who are fed up with an ineffective D.A.'s office. And who better to go after such an above-the-law group than ... Dirty Harry? Car chases and gunfights rule the day in ""Magnum Force"", but the tension and taut direction of Don Siegel is sorely missing (replaced by the made-for-TV-movie style of Ted Post). And the film is written by none other than Michael Cimino and John Milius (heavyweights by any standard), but the story here tends to meander, while the movie stands best as an excuse to see Eastwood reload his Smith and Wesson for another go-around. And this might be nitpicking, but why is Harry still on the force? When last we saw Callahan, he was throwing away his badge after skirting the law to nail the untouchable bad guy. I can't really see a more distinct line drawn in the sand for a police officer, but this movie has our no-nonsense cop back on the force as if nothing happened. ""Magnum Force"" lacks the punch of the original, and I don't see myself watching this again, anytime soon. 5/10",Magnum Force
40,christopher-underwood,This begins really well,7,30 August 2017,"This begins really well with excellent credits, introducing us uncompromisingly to the weapon of the title, some vigorous, if seemingly over zealous traffic patrol cop action, an amazing telescopic rifle execution of a whole bunch of crime boys and their half naked molls, some wise-cracks and even an aircraft highjack. But Ted Post is no Don Seigel and things soon slow down as the rather tiresome battle of words between Eastwood and his boss replace battle on the streets. Action does reassert itself and interest is just about maintained throughout but the film is far too long. I actually like the 70s slips from full on action to mundane ordinariness from time to time with the sun catching the lens and things happen without direct relevance to the story, but this gets too sloppy at times and it seems a long slog to a disappointing finale, or two.",Magnum Force
41,JamesHitchcock,Clean Harry,6,21 December 2007,"The first ""Dirty Harry"" film ended with Inspector Harry Callahan throwing away his badge and resigning from the San Francisco Police Department in disgust. The character, however, was clearly too popular for the franchise to end there, as Clint Eastwood went on to make four sequels, of which ""Magnum Force"" was the first. Harry has been reinstated in the force, but is as disenchanted with the job as ever, particularly with his liberal, by-the-book superior Lieutenant Neil Briggs. Briggs disapproves of Harry's methods and has moved him from the homicide department to the stakeout team. Harry proves ruthlessly effective in his new job, bloodily foiling both the hijacking of an airliner and a raid on a liquor store, but regards it as a demotion and wants to get back on homicide.He gets his chance when several notorious villains- racketeers, drug dealers, pimps- are murdered by a gang of vigilantes. Harry is reassigned to homicide to help track down the killers, who turn out to be a group of rookie traffic cops with unorthodox views on the best methods of enforcing law and order. The vigilantes, who call themselves ""Magnum Force"" after the handgun they use, have no compunction about gunning down not only the criminals who are their intended targets but also anyone else who gets in their way, including one of Harry's police colleagues, Charlie McCoy. The film may have inspired the later Michael Douglas thriller, ""The Star Chamber"", in which it is a group of judges, rather than policemen, who take it upon themselves to execute their own form of vigilante justice. In both cases the motive of the vigilantes is the same; frustration with a legal system which allows obvious criminals to go free on technicalities. It comes as no surprise when the supposedly liberal Briggs is exposed as the secret ally of Magnum Force.""Magnum Force"" seems to have been intended as a sort of public apology to those liberals who criticised ""Dirty Harry"" as advocating the use of violent and uncompromising methods of policing. Clint Eastwood's character, formerly the gung-ho maverick, here becomes Clean Harry, the unlikely advocate of due process and the sworn opponent of those who would take the law into their own hands. This transformation is never entirely convincing, but at least the film-makers could argue that Harry only took the law into his own hands when lives were at stake; the vigilante cops do so cold-bloodedly in order to take revenge. Harry's character is softened in other ways; he becomes less of a loner and is even provided with a romantic interest in the shape of a Japanese-American girlfriend.""Magnum Force"" lacks the depth of the original ""Dirty Harry"", a film which asked some searching questions about the philosophy of law enforcement. It is, however, stylish and exciting, better than some of the later instalments in the series such as ""The Dead Pool"". It has some good action sequences, including car chases, that staple of seventies cop films, especially those set in San Francisco with its switchback hills. Eastwood brings to his role the same combination of coolness and menace as he did in the original, and receives good support from Hal Holbrook as the treacherous Briggs. David Soul makes a pre-""Starsky and Hutch"" appearance as one of the vigilante cops. Altogether a watchable thriller. 6/10",Magnum Force
42,DKosty123,When the Cops Turn Bad Can the good one save them,6,19 August 2008,"This one is not quite up to the standard of the first film, but even though the cast is limited there are violent scenes galore as it appears much more violent than the first Harry film.This film other than Eastwood does not even resemble the first movie. It does turn up the violence. When I saw this, I left the theater still shaking from the violent sequences.There is less nudity in this movie. fewer people survive this movie. I recommend it as a way to kill some time if your not too busy. This movie did start some of the interest in vigilante's. This one has very little female interest compared to others in the series. It does keep the series going as it was made on the cheap. The whole Harry series does this as none of them are real expensive to make.",Magnum Force
43,Red-Barracuda,A bit overlong but decent enough follow up to Dirty Harry,7,22 November 2011,"All things considered, Magnum Force is a pretty decent follow up to Dirty Harry. Not that it's in the same league as that film of course but as sequels go it's not bad. It sort of looks to me that it was some kind of response to the accusations that the original film attracted of being a fascistic police brutality manifesto. In this one we have some renegade policemen handing out vigilante justice to an assortment of low-life's that the justice system hasn't been adequately dealing with. It can surely be no coincidence on the film-makers part that in this instance Harry Callaghan is made to look relatively libertarian alongside these cops. Although this plot-line is in some ways a weakness, as in the original flick the villain was an irredeemable scumbag, where here we have cops who take out characters such as a pimp who brutally murders one of his prostitutes in the back of a cab. The problem is that I think most of us are cheering the comeuppance of lowlifes such as this, so the villains of this movie aren't entirely unsympathetic which dilutes the dynamics a bit.If it could be said that Harry is softened a bit here, pretty much everything else is ramped up. There's more violence, nudity, swearing and sleaze. But never has the truism less can be more been more appropriate than here, as the overall effect is much less effective. The direction is more sluggish and the movie is definitely too long. It could easily have been a good 20 minutes shorter, and the last third is a bit lacking overall. However, as I mentioned earlier it's really not too bad either. There is plenty of violent action to keep things interesting. And the idea of a succession of sleazy characters getting knocked off is not too bad an idea.So, some reservations for sure but overall pretty good fun.",Magnum Force
44,Rainey-Dawn,Better Than Dirty Harry,9,20 October 2014,"This sequel to Dirty Harry is awesome. I think it's better than Dirty Harry (the first film in the series). What I like about this second film is the air of mystery surrounding the ""bad cops"".Some people have wondered why Dirty Harry does not join the ""bad cops"". Dirty Harry does not always follow the rules - he'll make his own rules up as he see fit. So why doesn't Harry join the group of ""bad cops""? It's just like Harry's movie catchphrase: ""A man's got to know his limitations."" The answer is within the film.You do not have to watch the first movie, Dirty Harry, to know what is going on in this second film - but I do recommend watching Dirty Harry first.This is a great prime-time film. 9.5/10",Magnum Force
45,disdressed12,( Dirty Harry 2) better than the original film,8,6 May 2010,"this second film in the Dirty Harry series of films is,in my mind,better than the first one.the story is better.it's a bit more complex.though not so complex that you can't understand what's happening.it has more substance to it.it's not as straight forward,so you have to think about what's going on.as the viewer,you're never 100% really sure who's bad and good.there are better one liners in this one as well.Harry(Eastwood)has more to do this time around.the action is a bit more intense this time around,as well.there are no slow spots,unlike the first one.everything flows much more smoothly.it's just an all around better picture.for me,Magnum Force is an 8/10",Magnum Force
46,KineticSeoul,Solid sequel to the first Dirty Harry movie,7,23 February 2012,"Okay so Dirty Harry is back again as an inspector despite the ending from the first movie. Because the first movie made money. And this time the movie has a bigger budget and the stakes are higher. Clint Eastwood is back again playing Harry as the cocky and yet badass inspector who fights for what he believes is right. Anyways this time it's Dirty Harry vs. a Vigilante that goes around killing bad guys and puts the law into his own hands. So this battle is a tough call although the audience knows who the main protagonist is. Which is interesting because Harry is a sort of a Rogue cop that has the mentality that ""the ends justify the means"". The chase scene in this movie is well done, not amazing but for a movie that was made in the 70's it's exceptional. Although there are some really great chase scene in other 70's movies. Anyways it was entertaining throughout the build up that leads to the chase and shootout near the end.7.8/10",Magnum Force
47,OllieSuave-007,Dirty Harry a Force to be reckoned with.,8,13 July 2015,"This is the first sequel to Dirty Harry, where Inspector Harry Callahan (Clint Eastwood) goes after vigilante cops, who are going above the law in gunning down some of the city's top criminals.As with Dirty Harry, the mystery begins immediately when an acquitted gangster is gunned down in broad daylight by a traffic cop, and then a trial of more incidents occur. In the middle of if all, there are these random crimes foiled by Callahan, which showcases his strength and witty attitude as he deals with those city's scumbags. This gives us a good mixture of suspense and action as the audience is kept engaged in following the main plot.The cinematography by Frank Stanley captures the tense atmosphere and bustling city life of San Francisco and the direction of Ted Post did a nice job directing, keeping the film interesting for the most part and leaving little room for boring fillers (however, I did wish there were a little more of the revenge and paycheck elements in the story). The acting was great, particularly that Clint Eastwood, who does his usual deadpan delivery whenever he can and his unorthodox ways of delivering justice and standing up to his superiors.This movie shows that despite how slow the justice system is, Callahan finds a way to deliver it swiftly while still upholding the law, and the good cop vs. renegade cop angles leaves us with a captivating entry in the Dirty Harry trilogy.Grade B",Magnum Force
48,bensonmum2,What happened to Dirty Harry?,6,26 February 2005,"Having been busted down to surveillance duty, Dirty Harry is itching to get back into the real action. A series of murders force his superiors to bring him back. Soon, Harry has his own ideas about the murders - it looks like they're being committed by a policeman.This Dirty Harry sequel lacks the punch of the original. The plot is pretty much a second rate police story. Anyone can spot the killers from the moment they appear on screen. There is no real suspense or tension. And the finale ends up being very anti-climatic. The movie might have been much better with someone other than Post as director. He did, IMO, another poor job with Eastwood's Hang 'em High",Magnum Force
49,gridoon,Should've been more forceful.,6,14 November 2001,"""Magnum Force"" is probably the best of the four ""Dirty Harry"" sequels, and it presents Harry in a different, more human light, but it still has more than its share of problems. Harry takes too much time to figure out the case, the direction lacks rhythm, there are too many drawn-out action sequences than go on for so long that the suspense evaporates, and there are also a few too many clumsy tracking shots and awkwardly fast camera movements. Oh well, at least Eastwood is still in top form and the music score is just great.     (**1/2)",Magnum Force
50,sol1218,Are you the cop who lives upstairs?,8,22 October 2003,"It seems that between ""Dirty Harry"" and ""Magnum Force"" Inspector ""Dirty"" Harry Callahan,Clint Eastwood, had learned the value of the Bill of Rights and the US Constitution. Unlike in the first ""Dirty Harry"" movie where Harry was the sole judge jury and executioner of all those that he deemed were guilty of crimes against the people of the city of San Francisco. In ""Magnum Force"" Harry actually believes in letting the system do it's job and not take the law into your, or Harry's,own hands. A number of the top criminals in San Francisco from corrupt labor leaders to sadistic street pimps have been done away with by what seems to be a rouge element of the SF Police Department and Harry's boss lieut. Briggs, Hal Holbrook, wants to find out just who's responsible. Harry, between shooting plane hijackers and convenient store hold up men, is also interested in stopping these criminals in uniform since their breaking the law, like average criminals, and the very thought of them breaking the law just gets Harry's Irish up. Inspector Harry Callahan is assigned to take part in the bust of a mob hideout and when the police operation is put into full gear something goes wrong, the mobsters are tipped off, and a policeman and a number of mobsters, most of them by Harry, are killed in the shoot-out that follows. Harry realizes that there's someone in the police force that's behind all those vigilant killings and tipped off the gangsters in order to have them killed in the shoot-out! That instead of having them arrested and and brought to trial. It's decided there and then by ""Dirty Harry"" Callahan that not only is he going to put a stop to those killings but also to those who are doing them: Dirty Harry style! By far the best of the ""Dirty Harry"" movies with Clint Eastwood never better in his role as ""Dirty Harry"" Callahan in the most action-packed and exciting ""Dirty Harry"" film ever made. Eastwood is much freer and less constraint then he was in the first ""Dirty Harry"" film. Which makes the action go faster and also make it far more exciting with a great cast and a much better action director, Ted Post. Post keep things moving when it comes to keeping the tempo of the action in the movie up and the talking and explaining down, by Harry and his fellow police officers and friends, as to why Harry is called ""Dirty Harry"" every ten minutes in the film like in the first ""Dirty Harry"" movie. Great ending sequence at the San Francisco Navy Yard with Harry taking care of business by doing in the bad guys and making the city safe again until the next ""Dirty Harry"" film comes blazing along.",Magnum Force
51,Robert_duder,In some ways superior to the original...this is more in the life of the infamous Harry,8,9 September 2010,"Magnum Force is like a condensed version of a really great 70's Cop TV Show. There isn't just one main story but rather we get to see Harry Callahan in various situations, doing his daily routine as a cop, coming across various challenges with his superiors and such but then at the heart is this intense mystery and thriller about a rogue cop (or cops) killing mobsters, villains and others. The best thing about Magnum Force is just watching Harry in his element. Ultimately it helps us understand more about this vivacious character that seemed to work on the brink of madness in the first film doing anything he can to clear the streets of 'scum.' In the end the film humanizes him much more and perhaps it would seem he has a little less edge to him but in a good way if that makes sense. Whereas the original Dirty Harry really captured San Francisco and brought it to life, the follow up doesn't really utilize the San Francisco backdrop as much. Its still present but just not as vividly used. This one is all about the cops and their lives and Harry's interaction with them.Harry Callahan is probably one of the amazing Clint Eastwood's best characters with the most depth and really larger than life on screen. He doesn't grumble and grunt his way through the role (and nobody loves his grumbling and grunting more than me) but instead Harry is full of life and passion and a true determination to do what is needed no matter what. This fills in everything you wanted to know about Harry from the first film. Legendary character actor Hal Holbrook joins the force as Harry's nemesis and Lieutenant. He goes toe to toe with Eastwood repeatedly in a battle of wits and holds his own. Holbrook probably gives easily the second best performance in the film next to Eastwood especially in the latter part of the film. Mitch Ryan plays Eastwood's friend of years Charlie McCoy who is going through many problems emotionally. I wish Ryan had a far bigger part because I think he was excellent in the one big scene he gets and could have really done great in the film. Tim Matheson is also a familiar face in character acting and is solid as a hot headed young traffic officer hellbent on cleaning up the streets. He should also get more screen time. Same can be said for Felton Perry who plays Harry's partner Early. I suppose when you're sidekick to Dirty Harry himself you are bound to take a backseat but I would have liked to have seen more of him.So my biggest issue with Magnum Force can be summed up in that the supporting actors could have been used so much more than they were. Also the ridiculous romance forced into the story with Harry and his neighbour is not only unnecessary but completely out of whack with the story. Unlike the first film Harry doesn't have a clear cut enemy or villain. There isn't just one killer although for awhile he is represented by one of the officer vigilantes. Still he isn't just being chased or chasing down one serial killer but a group of his own really amping up the tension in the film. The climax goes beyond that of the original including a huge twist to the film, a high speed car chase, and an epic shoot out worthy of an Eastwood film. Director Ted Post came from a heavy background in Television and it shows in his style for Magnum Force but it works perfectly fine for the film. I did score Magnum Force higher than Dirty Harry because in several ways it is better. Exploring Callahan as a character makes this one superior. The climax is even better, as mentioned, and it simply is a great thriller/mystery/cop drama and makes for a great film. ""A man's got to know his limitations..."" Man I love Eastwood. 8/10",Magnum Force
52,Lejink,Force majeure,7,30 November 2011,"Second outing for Clint Eastwood's anti-hero is an absorbing thriller, let down by some sloppy characterisation and the lack of a killer (no pun intended) scene or even iconic dialogue. It starts off poorly with the title credits lamely played over an almost static shot of the title weapon (very ""Sledge Hammer"") but once we get past the token scene reminding us of Harry's ""shoot first, ask questions later"" policing policy, the main plot strand about an internal police death-squad violently taking out known felons dominates the film.There are some humanising touches around Harry's character, although these stereotypically show him as irresistible to women, rebellious to authority and almost friendly and caring for his young black sidekick, so that nothing new is revealed about what makes him tick. There is something condescending about the treatment of these supporting characters, especially the portrayal of Callahan's young Oriental neighbour who despite hardly seeing him around, seems desperate to jump into bed with him.Better to stick with the action of which there is plenty. There's intrigue as Callahan's instincts lead him to find the true identities of the assassination bureau and a good twist as their ringleader emerges from the shadows.The acting is mostly fine, Eastwood naturally dominating in his typical laconic manner. Hal Holbrook is also excellent as his testy superior and David Soul shines in a pre-Hutch role. Ted Post directs with some flair with some blunt lapses while Lalo Schifrin contributes a typically gritty soundtrack. The film makes its main point about the dangers of vigilantism and cleverly uses Harry Callahan of all people as a counterpoint to its proponents.Some might argue as to whether all the violence was necessary and I felt the grisly death of a black prostitute bordered on the gratuitous but on the whole this was superior cop-fare and a good sequel to the trailblazing ""Dirty Harry"".",Magnum Force
53,ElMaruecan82,When Harry questions his dirtiness ...,8,16 October 2012,"1971. Movies audiences met with a new kind of cinematic hero through the ground-breaking ""The French Connection"", ""Shaft"" and the most emblematic of all, ""Dirty Harry"", directed by Don Siegel and starring Clint Eastwood as the ruthless Police detective with unconventional methods: Harry Callahan. The film was released at a convenient time, during the Nixon era and less than two years after the Mansion massacre put a deathblow on the whole dream of 'peace and love' inherited from the hippie counterculture. ""Dirty Harry"" had such a huge psychological impact that it was even described by the distinguished critic Pauline Kael as a 'right-wing fantasy' with some explicit glimpses of fascism. Dirty Harry became an American icon for the wrong reasons, and the no- less iconic weapon, the Magnum .44 that inspired the ""lucky"" speech became the unlikely symbol of a new kind of law enforcement. And viewers responded to that symbol, and it's not surprising that the Magnum .44 occupies the screen during the whole opening credits sequence of ""Magnum Force"", the sequel directed by Ted Post. But it's important to get back to the context of the first film. In the pessimistic (or nihilistic?) 70's, people looked for figures such as Harry Callahan, Jimmy 'Popeye' Doyle or John Shaft in order to keep faith on their safety rather than the agonizing legal authority, as if it was better to be safe than let the chaos infect the American lifestyle, it was not a cynical but rather a practical view of life during a cynical period. It was the birth of 'vigilante' movies, a sub-genre of the cop-thriller that would reach a fantastic paroxysm with ""Taxi Driver"", from young director Martin Scorsese and would end in style with Abel Ferrara's explosive directorial debut ""Mrs. 45"". After that, the genre would decline to the level of mindless bloody B-movies such as the dreadful ""Death Wish II"" and other Golan-Globus productions.The vigilante practice takes its origins from America's most obscure times, when the arm of the Law couldn't reach the smallest towns or interfere with such common practices as mobbing and lynching. The phenomenon was accentuated with the development of gangsterism and the progressive use of mass murdering weapons like machine-guns, and the growing political immunity of powerful criminals, Mafia bosses and other Al Capone-likes, who made Law look either powerless or accomplice of a corrupted system. The substantial philosophy governing the vigilante groups was that fighting crime implied the use of the same weapons, a sort of ends-justifies-the-mean necessity that leads to the paradoxical state where the best way to uphold the Law is to act against it for its own good.Naturally, the eye-for-an-eye principle goes against the progressive nature of civilization, and should not be tolerated because no one could ever see where it ends and in fact, only the strong could take advantage from it. To give you an example, if the United Nations Organization is supposed to interfere when a country plans to invade another one, then how come the Iraqi War happened in 2003? The same goes in microcosm in the Streets of San Francisco, law is here to protect everyone, and even if it does protect criminals, the system would still be the least imperfect of all. The irony is that the same Harry Callahan, who seemed to be the incarnation of the vigilante figure in ""Dirty Harry"", fights against it in ""Magnum Force"" and the contradiction is so evident that it can't be coincidental.Indeed, ""Magnum Force"" works like a sort of self-defense cry addressed to those who labeled the first film as a 'fascist' movie that legitimated the use of violence or cruel methods when it was against criminals. The film confronts Harry Callahan to an organization that coordinates the murders of unpunished criminals; it opens with the gruesome murder of a Mafia boss who's just been acquitted for a technicality. The execution is so cold-blooded that you'd almost feel bad for the bad guys, and the executioners, all traffic cops, look so clean that it's hard to believe they are the villains. But it's an interesting twist in a series that caricatures to the extreme the fascist allegations and confront them to Harry, a way to say: ""these are the real fascists, good old Harry can't be one of them"".And that's the strength of ""Magnum Force"", not only it takes some distance from the first film by providing an original villain, much more difficult to reach because it's a group, but it also does an effort to rehabilitate Harry Callahan, without changing much in the character, as cool and charismatic as ever. The main difference is that he's not fighting a dangerous psychopath cruel enough to awaken his most sadistic impulses, he's like confronted to his inner demons, to people who think like him and even more, and that adds a redeeming dimension of depth in the character. One of the film's most repeated lines is ""A man's got to know his limitations"", and it's very true to the story, because Harry himself questions his own beliefs in justice, by understanding their limits, and so do we.The villains, among which, David 'Hutch' Soul gives a passably memorable performance, are less 'impacting' than Scorpio but the film is saved by the supporting presence of Hal Holbrook as Lieutenant Briggs who doesn't play the typical incompetent angry superior. The film is beyond movie stereotypes and thanks to an intelligent screenplay from John Milnius, who'd write ""Apocalypse Now"", ""Magnum Force"" is an insightful continuation of one of the most controversial series made in the 70's, with enough guts to disobey some aspects that forged the initial fascination for Harry Callahan, and chill down the feverish minds that adulated him for the wrong reasons. By demonstrating that the noblest impulses can determine 'evil' actions, ""Magnum Force"" creates a sort of revisionist quality that certainly rehabilitate the series.",Magnum Force
54,MOscarbradley,A lot better than I expected.,7,2 June 2021,"With a screenplay by John Milius and Michael Cimino, ""Magnum Force"" really out to be better than it is but then you realise the director is Ted Post so maybe we should be thankful it's as good as it is. Post was a jobbing director of limited talent so you might say he was really only as good as his material. ""Magnum Force"" was the second, in what turned out to be, the 'Dirty Harry' franchise and as follow-ups, (as opposed to sequels), go this is an enjoyably crude yarn.This time round a group of rogue cops, (David Soul, Tim Matheson, Kip Niven and Robert Urich), are dispensing their own brand of justice, killing bad guys, (and anyone else who gets in their way), and it's up to Harry to stop them. Are you in any doubt that he would? It's a good plot and, to be fair, Post handles the action sequences with considerable aplomb. Unfortunately Clint walks through it as if on autopilot but then, as actor, he too was really just as good as his material.",Magnum Force
55,Pjtaylor-96-138044,Do I feel lucky?,8,27 April 2020,"While 'Magnum Force (1973)' isn't as good as 'Dirty Harry (1971)', it's perhaps more consistently entertaining. It also feels like an apt follow-up, exploring the grey area between right and wrong that Harry himself firmly resides in. It's an attempt to rectify the cries of ""fascism"", however legitimate they may be, caused by its predecessor, seeing its focal officer define his stance on the difference between police-work and vigilantism. Even if he's standing on the line, he doesn't intend to cross it. Surprisingly, though, this doesn't feel like a walk-back, but rather a legitimate attempt to explore a tricky subject and to further develop Eastwood's lead. It's really great stuff, actually. The rest of the movie is just as enjoyable. The mystery at its centre is consistently engaging and it has a number of exciting action sequences, to boot. Its finale, especially, is fantastic, as it moves from a suspense scene to a car chase to fist fight to an explosive finish. The piece is really rather violent, with its brutal killings being genuinely painful. It also manages to pull off a couple of very classic twists without telegraphing them too much, fitting them into its narrative as naturally as possible. It all just works. It isn't as dark as the first in its series - nor, indeed, as generally accomplished - but it's just as entertaining. It's easily the second best 'Dirty Harry' movie and it's a great detective-drama, too. 8/10",Magnum Force

57,lesleyharris30,"Typical Sequel that Offers little to Differentiate from it's Predecessor,",6,13 June 2015,"Magnum Force is a good movie with a reasonably well developed storyline and a talented cast. It has plenty of great action sequences and some intense scenes, Clint Eastwood is once again in great form as Harry Callahan, he slips back in to the role very naturally and with pure class. My main problem with the film is that it is a very typical action film that was clearly only made because the first one was a success, they didn't seem bothered to put together a sequel that differentiates itself from its predecessor. I think it should have developed Harry's character some more, they are given so much time with this second movie to give the audience new information about him, which is something I feel sequels always should do to a certain degree, but they didn't use it to full effect. It may be a predictable and cliché action thriller, but Eastwood and several other great cast members still make this film enjoyable, and I would recommend it if you ever see it on television and have some time to kill. Harry Callahan investigates the murders of some of San Francisco's undesirables. Best Performance: Clint Eastwood Worst Performance: Robert Urich",Magnum Force
58,CuriosityKilledShawn,Better than the first movie,8,25 March 2018,"The longest Dirty Harry movie, clocking in at 124 minutes, Magnum Force actually gives us a plot with multiple threads to follow, and is, as a result, a much better movie than the original. This time around Harry must solve a series of brutal vigilante murders, gradually narrowing it down to a group of corrupt cops. He does actual detective work this time and uses his cunning to track the bad guys. The trick with deliberately missing his mark at the shooting range to retrieve the incriminating bullet was a smart move. There was nothing like this in the, frankly overrated, first movie.The violence, even by today's standards, is graphic and upsetting. Seeing corpses writhe in agony after getting shot directly in the forehead, is hard to watch. Imagine suffering such a would and, knowing you were dying, lost control of your limbs. You don't see this in movies anymore. Gun violence is often overplayed and made to look cool while the grim reality of being murdered in this horrible way is rarely seen. I appreciate the movie for having the moxie to show us a more realistic depiction.Director Ted Post, who directed Eastwood in Hang 'Em High, uses the anamorphic Panavision framing very well and there are multiple awesome compositions in the film. The slow, laid-back pace of Don Siegel is gone and the movie feels broader in scope while at the same time being an ironic response to the negative critical backlash that the first received. There's more weight and wit in Magnum Force, there's more to talk about, giving it higher re-watch value.I know my opinion is controversial, but Magnum Force is simply more enjoyable and prompts deeper debate.",Magnum Force
59,callanvass,One of the rare occurrences where a sequel is almost as good as the original.,9,24 April 2010,"Magnum Force is a little bit different then Dirty Harry, but just as wonderful, nonetheless!. Dirty Harry has many of the same traits that made Dirty Harry so wonderful. Gritty feel, rough locations, a tough as nails Harry Callahan, and many classic shootouts, but I also appreciated the fact that Magnum Force wanted to go its own way. I loved the concept of Rookie Cops taking justice into their own hands, going above the law and killing all the corrupted criminals in vicious and brutal ways, it really made for an interesting storyline I thought. I loved it when Harry clashed with Lt. Briggs|Hal Holbrook| it was always and intense, and seeing two terrific legendary actors go at it in verbal wars was fabulous. To this day, the twist at the end of Magnum Force retains its shocking impact in every way, and giving us one of the most thrilling finales ever filmed. Magnum Force like Dirty Harry, is a treat to watch, it's almost as good as that film to be honest, and not many sequels are able to pull that off, then again Harry Callahan isn't anything ordinary.Performances. Clint Eastwood is wonderful as Harry once again. He portrays the same characteristics as he did in Dirty Harry that made him so Iconic. Hal Holbrook is fantastic as the stubborn, power happy Briggs. This is one of his most memorable roles, and with good reason. Mitch Ryan has a small, but memorable role as McCoy. David Soul is quite chilling as Davis, he played the vigilante rookie cop wonderfully.Bottom line. Magnum Force is a sequel that many studios need to watch to make a great followup. Like Dirty Harry, its powerful impact remains intact today, and I can't believe the underrated 7.0 rating!. A required viewing.9/10",Magnum Force

61,redryan64,.44 Mag Sequel,8,23 June 2014,"FOLLOWING THE Phenomenal success of 1971's DIRTY HARRY, the natural succession of events would, could and did bring us the inevitable sequel. Having invented the character in that of Inspector Harry Callahan, which was sort of Lawman of the OLd West in the mid 20th Century San Francisco, Mr. Clint Eastwood established what would become a screen franchise. Much like so many other popular films with characters that take on lives of their own, it is usually a case of dumb luck; rather than artistic abilities.IN CHOOSING THE subject matter of MAGNUM FORCE, the production team seemingly wanted to maintain the bad-ass persona; yet they wanted to hit it from another angle. Instead of giving us an account of another spectacular and heinous crime, this go round we have a series of killings of some of the dredge of the underworld's organized crime. Harry is assigned to the case (or rather the Crime Pattern) by his superior, Lieutenant Briggs (Hal Holbrook).HARRY'S INNER SENTIMENTS are questioned after some casual remarks about the appropriate end met by such human vermin is heard by Briggs and others. After all, he may be a fanatical protector of the public safety, but here is still civility and the law. Could it be that our Harry doesn't believe in the Rule of Law in a Nation of Law? PUTTING JUST A little complication into the game is the inclusion of a sort of sub-plot involving some 2 Wheel Motorcycle Cops. Veteran Charlie McCoy (Mitchell Ryan) is under suspicion of being a rogue responsible for killing with his service revolver. After years of stress and dealing with the criminal element, he is in state of a near nervous breakdown.THROWN INTO THE mix are some young, newly recruited and certified Motorcycle Cops, portrayed by David Soul, Tim Matheson, Kip Niven and Robert Urich. All of these, as well as veteran Charlie McCoy, are suspected of being assassins of these vicious, low-life thugs. But the big question is just who is the guy behind all of this? IT HAS JUST occurred that the dramatic device employed here, bears a strong relationship to the plotting of the old Serials. In one of those ""Cliff Hangers"" or ""Chapter-plays"", there was often a masked or completely unknown sort of mystery villain. He was usually in reality some other well respected character in the story; having his identity exposed in the last chapter.ANOTHER NOTION THAT we have long entertained is that this sequel, MAGNUM Force, was at least in part, intended to show that Harry does, indeed, believe in our system of Criminal Justice. He even states so at one point.SO, AS BRUTALLY violent and gory as the depictions of bloody killings are here, they are intended to give Inspector Callahan a new, gentler, more fan-friendly personality.IN A RELATED story of ""Life imitating Art,"" when DIRTY HARRY and MAGNUM FORCE came out, a Smith & Wesson Model 29, .44 Magnum pistol could not be found in gun shops around the country; the real police of America were buying them.SO, YOU SEE, we all have our little fantasies!",Magnum Force
62,Dr_Coulardeau,When the police becomes incompetent it turns out rotten,9,4 February 2015,"Once the matrix or the mould is in place, the formula constructed in the first film works all by itself but you have to vary the dressing of the composed salad bowl to make it attractive to the people.In this second film the desire for the good cops to carry out their mission with as much power force as possible that Dirty Harry represents is realized by a secret police ""sect"" or ""clan"" that systematically kills everyone who is a criminal or an associate of such criminals knowing that justice would never manage to have them convicted and sentenced to anything. In front of that impotence, only one solution: let some secret police society take over. The fun then is to see how Dirty Harry is going to cope with that group who he admires because of their shooting skills, who he must admire because they are cleaning up the criminal plate of San Francisco and yet he can only disapprove because they do not kill in action but they kill as vigilantes and hit men, which is cowardly since the targets have no say: they do not know anything is coming.Then it is Dirty Harry versus that clan or clique and he has to eliminate them all. For once his partner will not be killed though he will be so badly treated and shot that he will decide that kind of job is not for him, which Dirty Harry will support whole-heartedly. In the end Dirty Harry will manage to clean up the police, which is admirable in itself since that police has to be rotten to the core to be that inefficient, not to say incompetent.The action is brilliant though slightly too slow for present time taste. The special effects are rather primitive but the stunts are definitely OK.Dr Jacques COULARDEAU",Magnum Force

And I love it!",8,4 May 2019,"An out of control GOOD cop (Clint Eastwood) is in search of a BAD cop killing criminals out of revenge.One of the coolest Clint Eastwood movies. Yes, it is a bit silly now and then, because of some unbelievable silly plot turns, but it is nevertheless still very enjoyable and most of all COOL. Remember cool? Where did all those sixties and seventies cool guys go? Men were men back then. But even in this movie, the way HOW we look upon macho violent men is starting to shift in an interesting way. Let me explain:This movie is a sequel to ""Dirty Harry"" released in 1971. Many consider that one to be better, but I really prefer MAGNUM FORCE (1973), because it has got a terrific balance between macho violence and that particular seventies "" stand up for your civil rights"" kinda spirit. A great example is the fact that in MAGNUM FORCE there is a macho cop (Clint) who even prefers queer cops to straight cops provided they can shoot better. THAT'S the spirit of this movie. Macho, but seventies styled ""stand up for your civil rights"" kinda macho.One must not forget that in those early seventies days American students, American colored people and everybody who opposed authority, got their heads beaten in by police and military, during protests. This movie captures that spirit of revolt and standing up for your civil rights. Even a macho straight cop like Clint Eastwood is now respectful for civil rights in this movie, while in Dirty Harry he was just plain acting out of revenge. NO MORE of that right wing revenge killing by Clint in this sequel, which I personally like better. In an interview Clint Eastwood mentioned this was his personal favorite movie of the series (4) as well.On a technical note I wanna mention that the photography is really good. However outdated and a bit slow this action movie sometimes might look nowadays for youngsters, the photography is really on a qualtity level, comparable to the best of todays camerawork. I love that, when the director takes effort in making it look really good. Music by Lalo Schifrin is excellent as well, although it is definitely very much A SEVENTIES SOUND.Great suspsense, lots of thrilling action and especially a lot of COOL poses and terrific oneliners by Clint are the reason to watch this classic seventies dirty cop movie.

Then I liked the scene where Harry meets the new crew, at the target range, and shows how his .44 Magnum packs a punch. One of them had some trouble handling it because of the weight. His shooting tactics were hardcore. The cast of the rogues were great: David Soul(Before ""Starsky& Hutch""), Robert Urich,1946-2002(Before ""S.W.A.T"", ""VEGA$"", and ""Spenser For Hire"") The action was not lost, and the climax was top notch.

This time Harry takes on a new partner, Early Smith (Felton Perry). Harry is at odds with his tight assed boss Lt. Briggs (Hal Holbrook) who has had him reassigned from homicide to stake out duty.While stopping for a hamburger at an airport lunch counter, Harry hears of a plane hijacking in progress. The ever resourceful Harry dons a pilot's uniform and boards the plane as Captain. Harry overpowers the hijackers as expected.Apparent vigilantes have begun summarily murdering gangsters who have escaped the law through one technicality or another. The first of these is Ricca (Richard Devon) whom we meet leaving the court room after being found ""innocent"" of his crimes. Driving away, Ricca's car is pulled over by a traffic cop who guns down the four occupants and calmly drives away.Harry and Early, meanwhile have staked out a supermarket expecting it to be held up. They are not disappointed. The crooks enter the store and are promptly dispatched by Harry's 44 magnum, the most powerful handgun in the world. After a prostitute (Margaret Avery) is murder by her pimp (Albert Popwell), the pimp is pulled over by a traffic cop and murdered in the same fashion as Ricca.The brass at the San Francisco Police Department are becoming concerned. Briggs is force to bring Harry back to homicide to investigate. At the police target range, Harry meet four energetic and overly friendly rookie traffic cops: Davis (David Soul), Sweet (Tim Matheson), Astrachin (Kip Niven and Grimes (Robert Urich). Harry sees that all are expert marksmen.Harry runs into an old colleague Charlie McCoy (Michell Ryan) who is dispondent veteran with an apparent axe to grind who is separated from his wife Carol (Christine White). She invites Harry over for dinner one night and flirts with Harry who rejects her advances. Briggs tells Harry that he suspects gangster Palancio (Tony Di Gorgio) as being behind the murders. Harry suspects McCoy.At DiGorgio's (John Mitchum) stake out, McCoy is seen entering a building where three more murders are recorded. As the killer leaves the building, he encounters McCoy and murders him. Harry is suspicious that Davis was at the scene where McCoy was killed. He now suspects the four young traffic cops as being behind the killings. To prove this to himself he tricks Davis into firing his gun into a building at the police hand gun firing competition. He recovers the bullet and matches it to one taken from one of the victims but hold off showing it to Briggs.Harry meets the alluring Sunny (Adele Yoshioka) at his apartment building. She invites herself into Harry's bed. Harry find a bomb planted in his mail box and disarms it. He fears that Early will be similarly targeted. Before Harry can warn him, Early dies in his mail box explosion.A raid is planned on Palancio and his gang. Harry asks foe Davis and Sweet to back him up. Sweet is killed during the altercation. Apparently the gang hadreceived advance warning from an unknown source and one of the goals of the raid apparently, was to have Harry killed in the confusion. The rookies try to recruit Harry to their ranks but he refuses. Then they come after him. Harry manages to eliminate the three surviving traffic cops and then is confronted by Briggs who it turns out...................................Plenty of action and gun play as usual. Harry even gets to have some female companionship in this one. Hal Holbrook is great as the devious Lt. Briggs.

69,elshikh4,"Harry Meets His ""Evil"" Dark Side !",7,2 June 2008,"If the authority was condemned one way or another in (Dirty Harry - 1973) through the helpless laws, here in the sequel, it became condemned literally. And then it would be in all of the following movies, especially after the Watergate scandal. To the extent that in the movies of suspense nowadays, guessing that the chief of police is the one who did it; is mostly right! It overstepped the phase of good satires to the phase of ridiculous potboilers.(Harry) of all the people is the one who must appreciate the efforts of the killers in here. Or understand well their motives, statement, and nobility more than others. And why not? Since he is dirty Harry himself, the cop who's against the dirtiness of a city, and its stupid deficient laws. I liked when he was at one moment in question (""Maybe Harry did it?"" said by his black partner). The enemy this time was the dark side of (Harry), yet in its extremist. He was facing his worst nightmare of himself; however, it eventually proved that he wasn't THAT dirty. So when he faced that idealistic gang of killers, beating it cleverly, he assured that he was pure and rational, yet as violent as all the madness around him.The perusal of the new character continues, but with some repetition. Look at the scene of the airport; it began with (Harry) eating his lunch in a hurry, and just while he was chewing it, he found himself in the middle of stopping a running crime. It's the same situation from the first one; which took place in a street. Maybe because the people liked it, maybe to presents the character for the ones who didn't see it before, or maybe to represent that crime became the daily meal of character like (Harry). In part 4 (Sudden Impact - 1983), they would put him in the same situation again, yet in a diner while he was getting his coffee. And in part 5 (The Dead Pool - 1988), he pretends like he's having his lunch in a Japanese restaurant to do the same.Speaking about repetition but in a good way; remember how every time (Harry) has a partner from the minorities to confirm that ""he's NOT hating everybody"", so you see him with a Mexican (Part 1), an Afro-American (Part 2), a woman (Part 3) (considering the way of appreciating women's rights or working at the time, they were minority!), and a Japanese (Part 5), regarding that part 4 was an adventure for (Harry) out of the city as a lone ranger. Another lovely repetition: (Albert Popwell) as a different character in the first 4 movies. I think they considered him a lucky charm since ""Do you feel lucky, you punk?"" fame, where he was the punk!Everyone knows (Eastwood) as a director must easily notice how a lot of scenes were having him in front of the camera and behind it too. I could swear that the scene of his first meeting with the 4 young shooters was part of his uncredited directorial job. There were small and nice touches like (Harry)'s ghost of a smile while the 4 young cops were leaving the shooting's room. (Harry) there was consoling himself; whether because they were nearly half of his age and quite like his cleverness, or had each others and he just came in that late time to be alone.(Eastwood) carries on establishing himself greatly as a cold-blooded, crudely stubborn, good man with his own sense of humor. It's the (Eastwood) Force's special foundation for heroism ""Trade Mark"". However, I deemed casting (Hal Holbrook) as (Lt. Briggs) as the best thing in this movie. He could convince you that he was another executive, more than police officer; being nagging, rules' freak, and sadistically enjoying hindering the lead. By his shortness, thin figure, and acrid talking; (Holbrook) looked like a prefect thorn in the lead's side.I think they put the love scene to approve how Harry is a human being who needs to be loved. But in terms of sex and nudity on screen, in that scene or else, I see that they're filth more than beauty, degradation more than pleasure, and commercial more than anything! The dialogue and the chain of events were average. The action wasn't as ambitious as the original; for instance, (Eastwood) here was on the top of a hurling car, while in first (Dirty Harry) movie, it was a hurling bus!
As a whole, it tried to catch the flavor of the original, but without many elements of it, like its surprise effect, sharper editing, less dialogue, gloomy sense with a humming chorus in the back of the music (as if it's a community in pain, desperately screeching in the need of help), not to mention its sad satirical ending which seemed realistic more than showy.So, it became a franchise already, where ""commercial"" would exceed ""satirical"", to live some kind of platitude afterwards, and dive the new hero into violent blockbusters. It proves that being serious in a major studio's movie is something that hard indeed. Compare the original to most of the next Dirty Harries, likes, wannabes, till now, to thoroughly understand how the movie maker in Hollywood ""got to know his limitations""!",Magnum Force

Even when the guy's trying to grab a burger he ends up pretending to be a jetliner pilot so he can plug a few holes in a hijacker.There's not too much of a plot for this one (the film doesn't need one) – You can solve the mystery of who's behind the killings in about five seconds, but what you do get is loads and loads of bad guys getting what they deserve one way or another, and Harry almost, almost sympathises with the killers. But then doesn't because he's Harry Callaghan and states clearly that he does thing his own way. Because he's Harry Callaghan. And he does things his way.

In his own small way Inspector Callaghan (the aforesaid Mr C.Eastwood)tries to tread this middle path after a not entirely convincing Damascene conversion from a one man vengeance machine to a cop standing for Truth,Justice and the American Way.Although to be fair he's not having qualms about slotting the occasional scumbag he catches in flagrante. Sexily dressed in black leather and led by an enigmatic Mr D.Soul,four rookie biker cops are carrying out the self - imposed task of ridding San Francisco of some very bad guys.By bullet and bomb the city's finest are eliminating the city's worst.Unfortunately there is a degree of collateral damage - mainly semi - naked young women - but not much notice is taken by the brass until a cop is mercilessly despatched whilst walking in on the aftermath of one such killing. This rather spoils Callaghan's theory that the dead cop was the main suspect for the earlier killings and he eventually focuses on the right bad guys,finally hunting them down and despatching them in their turn. It turns out that Harry's boss (the splendidly disdainful Mr H.Holbrook) was the mastermind behind the cops' plan and he perishes by one of his own bombs(irony,see?). ""Magnum Force"" is not one of the more interesting Inspector Callaghan pictures mainly because apart from Messrs Eastwood and Holbrook none of the characters has any life.It is nicely shot in a hot,dry San Francisco that would be the envy of many a citizen of a cold,damp North European island.The main moral of the story would appear to be if you're a young blonde woman with a penchant for exposing her breasts,don't hang out with tough - looking geezers with chest wigs,water beds and swimming pools.

They've only known each other for about half a minute, making it one of the swiftest screen seductions on record, and it illustrates the fact that Eastwood's sex appeal is instant and uncomplicated... He is the conventional tough-guy par excellence  handsome, laconic, cynical, determined and independent; clearly a man to be idolized by other men and worshiped by women...",Magnum Force
78,barnabyrudge,"Hotly anticipated sequel to ""Dirty Harry"".... this one puts more emphasis on the violence, less on the story and characters.",5,1 September 2005,"I wouldn't say that Magnum Force is a disappointing film in its own right, but as a follow-up to the absolutely brilliant ""Dirty Harry"" I would say that it's a disappointing sequel. The original was a fairly ground-breaking cop thriller in terms of violence, but it had great characterisation, clever dialogue and genuine tension too. Magnum Force is really just about the violence. The characterisation is cartoonish, the dialogue contrived.... and the moments of tension are sporadic to say the least. There's something uncomfortable and tasteless about watching Harry coolly dispose of a couple of plane hijackers, or an undercover black cop being told to suck the barrel of a shotgun by a liquor store gunman, or a bunch of naked sunbathers being gunned down by a renegade machine gun-toting motorcycle cop. Perhaps Magnum Force is trying just a bit too hard to be controversial, when it ought to be concentrating on the action.High-profile criminals who have been released by the courts due to legal loopholes are being bumped off in San Francisco. Harry Callahan (Clint Eastwood) tries to figure out who is responsible for the executions. He knows that one or more motorcycle cops are responsible, and initially he suspects that it could be the work of Charlie McCoy (Mitchell Ryan), an old buddy who is growing suicidally disillusioned by the way that the crooks he keeps busting are being pardoned by the courts. Or perhaps the killers are a bunch of sharp-shooting rookie motorcycle cops (David Soul, Tim Matheson and Robert Urich)? Even though Harry can see that the legal system is flawed and frustratingly ineffective, he is still sworn to protect those considered ""innocent"" by the courts.... so he finds himself hunting the renegade cop(s) despite the fact that they have a valid point.Eastwood seems to be on auto-pilot in this one, trading off his tough persona rather than giving a performance of any real depth and feeling. The only performances that seem to carry any acting ""weight"" are given by Hal Holbrook and Felton Perry. Lalo Schifrin provides a sensational '70s score (perhaps the best thing about the film), but in most aspects the film is relatively lacklustre. Ted Post directs in a very workmanlike manner, never really sensing the opportunities to make this anything more than a standard police actioner. The plot, which has a potentially explosive moral question about whether it is right or wrong to release known criminals simply because of insubstantial evidence (and whether the vigilante cop/s are right to assassinate such lowlifes without the support of the law), remains sadly under-developed.",Magnum Force

I have to say i agree with the ""Magnum Force"" & their executions of the scum but they do go too extreme when they kill innocent bystanders too. The dark truth of the film will forever be relevant.""Magnum Force"" is a superior thriller that is drenched in truth!!! That the truth being that the so-called ""Justice System"" doesn't work & is corrupted & evil scum get off easy & a bunch of San Francisco motorcycle cops have had enough & have formed a deadly death squad type of team to clean up the trash that city hall lets out. Its a great storyline that is & always will be so relevant, the stories themes are timeless & so is this Classic violent Thriller.David Soul (Starsky & Hutch, Salems Lot) gives a nice cold-blooded & quietly menacing low-key performance as Davis, a main member of the killer squad of Vigilante cops & he is a great presence on screen.Eastwood is excellent as usual & has some very funny & witty lines throughout. This is Classic 70's Eastwood in a Classic 70's crime Thriller & as Harry he's met his match with these hard cops that take the anger that even harry feels about a corrupted System, & takes it to a new level of Vigilante vengeance & violence.If it wasn't for a strong moral center, Harry could've been one of these cops!!!I grew up on Eastwood films & consider him one of the greatest stars of Cinema History & has that Mythical presence that only a few actors have (Schwarzenegger & Will Smith have it too) that strong star quality & a face & voice we grew up watching & loving & that's why there's a comfort to watching these old films & watching Eastwood.Great music & beautifully shot.A Classic Eastwood movie.",Magnum Force
80,gcd70,Eastwood fans only,4,11 October 2007,"Following hot on the heels of ""Dirty Harry"" is ""Magnum Force"". Clint Eastwood returns as the no nonsense detective, 'Harry Callahan', as director Ted Post brings us a film which is very loyal to the first. The only thing really different about this film is the script, which does not reveal the killer unit late on. No real surprises though, except maybe for the ring-leader. However this movie is not at all filmed for mystery, but for action.If you're a ""Dirty Harry"" fan, you'll probably enjoy the first half of the film more, as Detective Callahan gets little opportunity to blow anyone away at the end. ""Magnum Force"" is for Eastwood fans only.Saturday, September 12, 1992 - Video",Magnum Force
81,Witchfinder-General-666,Harry Callahan Vs. Vigilantes,8,8 April 2009,"The first sequel to Don Siegel's 1971 masterpiece ""Dirty Harry"", ""Magnum Force"" of 1973 brings Inspector 'Dirty' Harry Callahan back - even though he just isn't quite as dirty in this one. Clint Eastwood is doubtlessly one of the most iconic actors ever as he personifies two archetype roles in cinema - the Spaghetti Western antihero who was defined by the role of the Man With No Name he played in Sergio Leone's Dollar trilogy, and the unorthodox copper whom he personified with his role as Harry Callahan in ""Dirty Harry"". When it came out in 1971, ""Dirty Harry"" caused outrage among critics for its political incorrectness and the violent no-nonsense attitude of its supremely bad-ass protagonist. This second film obviously tried to play these elements down a little, which wasn't the best idea in my opinion. Even so, ""Magnum Force"" remains a more than decent sequel which my fellow Callahan-fans can not afford to miss. Ted Post, who had already directed Eastwood in the tough-minded Western ""Hang 'Em High"" is doubtlessly a potent filmmaker who is capable of making a film gritty and uncompromising. And while the character of Harry Callahan is slightly more correct in ""Magnum Force"", the film does not scant with gritty violence as such.Prominent members of the San Francisco underworld are getting murdered one by one. Harry Callahan, who is investigating the murders, suspects that the culprit might be police himself... Maybe because ""Dirty Harry"" was critizised for a violent eponymous Cop/Hero character, ""Magnum Force"" has Harry fight against vigilantism. Even though this step sometimes seems to have been taken in order to becalm critics of the film, it is very well executed. Clint Eastwood, simply the epitome of coolness in my opinion, is once again great in the role of Harry Callahan, the archetype of the super tough, bad-ass, no-nonsense cinematic copper. Callahan, who has an Asian, somewhat hippie-ish, girlfriend (Adele Yoshikoa) in this one, still doesn't scant with outspoken remarks about punks and superiors alike. ""Magnum Force"" is again great in terms of cinematography and style and delivers some sequences of quite extreme violence. This is not one of my favorites of the 'Dirty Harry' Franchise. The greatest of them all is doubtlessly Don Siegel's original masterpiece of 1971. My personal second-favorite is the fourth part, ""Sudden Impact"", which Eastwood directed himself, simply because its the grittiest, meanest and downright dirtiest of them all. This second film in the series isn't en par with its predecessor, but it is definitely a more than decent sequel that entertains immensely. A must-see for all Callahan-fans, and highly recommendable to everybody who likes Police Thrillers and Action films.",Magnum Force
82,Agent10,A good follow up to a classic,7,29 July 2002,"Creating a follow-up to the amazing Dirty Harry must have resulted in weeks and weeks of frustration. Overall, the film was rather good and well shot, but there just wasn't a strong enough story to back up the complex nature of Harry. This was also one of those films which talked about the social moirés of the time. Harry, making the random reference about homosexuals was priceless, and should have been used in pro-gay rights slogans. Anyhow, this film was better than most sequels could ask for, so I have to say this was a good follow-up to a great movie.",Magnum Force
83,ShootingShark,Exciting Violent Dirty Harry Movie With Good Story And Strong Cast,6,27 October 2009,"When a string of apparent vigilante killings of notorious criminals hits San Fransisco, it's up to Inspector Harry Callahan to find out who's responsible.This is the second Dirty Harry movie, and in some ways its interesting premise is a reaction to the first film, which was (incorrectly) labelled by many critics as right-wing fascist propaganda. What if Harry were to come across a group of police vigilantes who took the law into their own hands and dealt out punishments as they saw fit ? Would he admire them ? Join them ? Arrest them ? It's an intriguing idea, and the script by John Milius and Michael Cimino explores it well, juggling Harry's contempt for political hogs and bleeding hearts with his moral values and objective view of society. If the writing has a flaw, it's that it takes a bit too long to get going, with four separate attacks before the good guys start to figure what's up. It's also not for the squeamish, with several gleefully violent sequences (a pool party gets ripped to pieces with a machine gun, a hooker is forced to drink drain cleaner, a naked woman is shot and falls from a penthouse balcony, a mobster is skewered by a crane), all edited for maximum impact by seasoned cutter Ferris Webster. The film is also a seventies style classic, most notably for Lalo Schifrin's delicious music and Popwell's classic Pimpmobile, a pink Cadillac Eldorado with crazy side vents, faux leather roof and sheepskin upholstery. Eastwood is in fine form (""A man's gotta know his limitations."") in this his signature role - in some alternate universe I think he is forever driving round Frisco in a green LTD with a wah-wah pedal on the soundtrack running down hoodlums - and the support cast is strong, notably reliable old pro Holbrook as the superior officer with a big secret, and Perry in the thankless partner role. The final twenty minutes features top-notch stuntwork by Buddy Van Horn and Carey Loftin, as Harry is first chased through the streets in his car and then takes refuge on foot in an abandoned aircraft carrier. Perhaps this movie could use a little tightening, but all in all a fine thriller and a seventies crime classic.",Magnum Force
84,Easygoer10,"Good, But Not Great",7,6 October 2020,"""Dirty Harry and ""Magnum Force"" owe everything to ""Bullitt"" (1968); Steve McQueen's career-defining role as an anti-hero cop. Besides McQueen's incomparable screen presence, the primary difference between them is authenticity. ""Magnum Force"" does not have it. Instead, this has quips and one liners; especially after he kills someone. This would be copied in ubiquitously. For example, blockbuster hits like ""Diehard"" (1988) or ""The Terminator"" (1984). A much better Clint Eastwood film is ""The Outlaw Josie Wales"" (1976), which he starred in and directed himself.",Magnum Force

This follow-up is great. The screenplay includes plenty of action, a fine supporting cast, good music and a bit of a twist to the tale for those who haven't read anything about the plot details of ""Magnum Force."" It is well documented that Clint Eastwood and director Ted Post clashed over several scenes during filming and that Eastwood's ego was getting the better of him. In addition, Ted Post felt his authority as director was being undermined. He refused to work with or speak to Clint Eastwood again. Whether any of this is true or just Hollywood gossip, is hard to say. What is a fact, is that a couple of scenes were left on the editing floor that should have been left in the final version. The script has some very good dialogue and Hal Holbrook is a great superior to Harry Callahan.",Magnum Force
86,Howlin Wolf,Blunt Force Trauma...,5,24 March 2009,"I have no idea yet whether the series gets progressively worse, but this was a pretty major disappointment to me, after a solid opening to the franchise...It just seemed more like a parody of a 'Dirty Harry' film because everything was way too overemphasised... If you don't know that the main character is a badass, then you shouldn't be watching a ""Dirty Harry"" film, so don't throw in extended irrelevant sequences (plane hostages, grocery store...) that have no relation to the main plot and appear to have been included solely for the purpose of glorifying the 'hero' - or if you do, then at least try and make them more subtle. It's pretty clear that John Milius is incapable of writing anything without broad strokes.The same goes for the iconic catchphrase... If the producers have their heart set on having Harry reprise one of his most memorable lines of dialogue, (""Do ya feel lucky... "") then shouldn't they have found a way to include it within the context of the actual script, rather than addressing it to the audience before the action even starts?! It's the indiscriminate use of signature touches like this - all for effect, and no worthier purpose - that in my opinion represents a blight on the entire film.",Magnum Force
87,punishmentpark,"Not a gem, but gem-like.",7,2 May 2015,"The '70s, (shotgun) violence, neat cinematography, cool soundtrack, San Francisco and (dirty) Eastwood in the mix!

88,seymourblack-1,Sticking With The System,8,10 August 2013,"Following the huge success of ""Dirty Harry"", it would have been understandable if (for box office reasons) the inevitable sequel had turned out to be just another slice of what was so popular the first time around. Fortunately, however, ""Magnum Force"" is far better than that. Whilst it retains its predecessor's focus on vigilantism, police officers who act unlawfully and the failures of the justice system, it also recognises that the solutions needed to deal with these problems aren't always quite as simple as those suggested in the earlier movie.The public are outraged after murder charges made against notorious gangster Carmine Ricca (Richard Devon) are dropped because of legal technicalities and shortly after, as Ricca and his associates are driving home, their car is stopped by a police patrolman. After making some brief checks, the patrolman produces a gun, shoots dead all four occupants and promptly leaves. Shortly after, a large group of people at a mob boss' pool party are killed by a motorcycle cop and in a later incident, a pimp is also shot dead by a police officer.SFPD Inspector Harry Callahan (Clint Eastwood) and his new partner, Inspector Early Smith (Felton Perry) are tasked with investigating the killings and after finding evidence that the pimp had offered his killer a bribe, Callahan concludes that the killer must be a cop. His further investigations reveal that the killings were actually carried out by a group of rookies who're all accomplished marksmen and regard Callahan as a role model. His reaction to their activities isn't what they expect and sets up a series of further developments which lead to the movie's exciting conclusion.The Harry Callahan of ""Magnum Force"" has fine-tuned his attitudes to authority and vigilantism in ways that are best exemplified when he says ""I hate the goddamn system but until someone comes along with changes that make sense, I'll stick with it"" and also ""I didn't shoot at anyone who didn't start shooting at me first"". Interestingly, though, his long-standing contempt for his boss, Lieutenant Briggs (Hal Holbrook) is actually given some justification in this story.""Magnum Force"" has an excellent script with numerous quotable lines that make a strong impression and there's also enough car chases, shoot-outs and stunts to satisfy even the most demanding action fans. The entire cast turn in creditable performances and predictably, Clint Eastwood brings his tough, softly-spoken character to life with consummate ease and style.",Magnum Force
89,TheUnknown837-1,not as good as the original (it was not expected to be) and sometimes campy...but who cares?,7,15 May 2009,"Of course it was only a matter of time after the incredible success of Don Siegel's ""Dirty Harry"" (1971) that a sequel would be released. In this case, two brief years passed and then ""Magnum Force"", the second chapter of the five-part Dirty Harry series came into theaters.Nobody expected ""Magnum Force"" to be any better than the original film and it's not. But that does not necessarily make it a bad film. It's not a bad film at all. The original is just a lot better. Clint Eastwood returns as the .44 Magnum-wielding San Francisco cop who begins to suspect men in his own department when a series of notorious people native to the city turn up murdered systematically one after another. And before long, just as you'd expect, Harry is blazing away with his cannon of a revolver and bodies are hitting the floor.""Magnum Force"" does not have the chilling and compelling atmosphere of its predecessor and it is really nothing more than just a shoot-em-up cop flick with a couple of great performances, one by Eastwood and another by David Soul as a spectacled corrupt cop and you can make out whose the mole in the system right from the start, but who cares? The movie sports a lot of well-done gunfights and action scenes, Eastwood has another creative tagline for the film, the movie holds up well through the duration of its running time, and although it is a disappointment when compared to the original, is still a ton of fun.",Magnum Force
90,Joxerlives,"The rarest of things, a superior sequel",10,18 May 2012,"Good as 'Dirty Harry' is I think 'Magnum Force' is actually superior. 'Dirty Harry' is famous for 'every frame votes Nixon', that it's a backlash against the sixties counter-culture (personified by Charlie Manson style villain Scorpio, the stereotypical hippie with his long hair and peace symbol belt buckle) which by the early 1970s had begun to degenerate into violence and anarchy. Thus 'Dirty Harry' tapped into a very real nerve amongst the 'moral majority' who felt the reforms of the justice system had gone too far. I think 'Magnum Force' is a more interesting film because it asks you 'Where is the the line?'. Ultimately it is a testament to Harry's character that he refuses to join the vigilantes when they make the offer, there's a secret liberal lurking beneath someone many had thought was purely a reactionary thug. As he says himself 'I'm afraid you've misjudged me"" (talking to the critics?). You get the feeling that Harry perhaps would have joined them if they'd been a little more careful not to hurt the innocent, notably McCoy and the various hookers. A shame they ditched the scenes where we see Davis save a mugging victim or the other cops writing articles despairing recent miscarriages of justice, it would have given more credibility to their viewpoint, they genuinely think what they're doing is right rather than just being a bunch of extreme rightwing nutjobs. You wonder if Briggs' and Davis' grief over McCoy is for real and conclude that it probably is.Interestingly if you watch the last Dirty Harry film 'The Dead Pool' Harry not only shoots an unarmed Mafioso who's running away but also kills a man whom he know has an empty gun. And indeed protects a murderous vigilante in 'Sudden Impact'. Maybe the years have made him come around to the vigilantes way of thinking? So many good things in this film. The music is excellent, I'm always amazed that someone hasn't re-edited it as a dance track. Clint Eastwood is great as ever as Harry, revealing a little more of his background and character (we learn that Harry is an ex-marine and where he's from in San Francisco). There's a noble weariness/sadness to Harry, none of his films ever end in triumph. In 'Dirty Harry' he throws his badge away at the end in despair at the system but we see police cars speeding to the scene and we know that ultimately he is vindicated for his actions, the police, his family, take him back. At the end of this film Harry is truly alone, he can't even trust his fellow officers any more.Early Smith is my favourite Dirty Harry partner (perhaps a deliberate move to counter some of the negative portrayal of Afro-Americans in both this and the previous film?) Some great humour amongst all the action and the action is terrific, especially the car/bike chase and the dockside shootout, interestingly in this film Harry doesn't kill any of the main villains by shooting them. In particular his killing of Astrachan on the carrier using karate blows to the neck is brutal and bloody, very realistic and a long way from the stylised martial arts of Bruce Lee popular at the time. The plot is good and dialogue well written, people act logically and believably at all times. I love the scene after the dockside shootout where Sweet has been killed and the Police Chief is berating a wounded Harry for the carnage. The doctor treating Harry smartmouths him back only for the Chief to tell him ""Doc I don't need any of your wisecracks, a police officer is DEAD!"" And both Harry and the doctor shut the hell up, realising that he's right and that he genuinely cares for his men. What makes it special though is the depiction of the vigilantes themselves. They seem so cool, handsome,(how AMAZINGLY good-looking is David Soul in 1973? He's like an angel!) clean cut and heroic but are actually disgruntled Vietnam Special Forces veterans who declare 'All our heroes are dead', voicing the cynicism inherent in their generation (the authoritarian flip side of the counter-culture villains in 'Dirty Harry' and 'The Enforcer'?). Their appearance is iconic, sexy and stylish but verging on the fascist. According to John Milius before this movie no one on the force wanted to be a motorcycle cop. Afterwards everyone wanted to be (and of course the porn industry took the outfit to heart, both male and female versions). It's hardly surprising that Robert Urich and David Soul would later find fame and fortune essentially playing heroic versions of their 'Magnum Force' characters, Detective Ken Hutchinson notably also using a Colt Python .357 Magnum revolver.If I were to have one criticism of the film it would be it's voyeurism and misogyny. We get nubile naked teenage girls to titillate the audience then they are brutally blown away to satisfy a puritan urge to see them punished for their sexiness in traditional slasher movie style. I can just never watch the horrible scene where the pimp kills his hooker in the taxi. Also a bit homophobic with the Guzman penthouse scene and Harry and Early's use of the word 'queer' (although of it's time). As some have pointed out you cannot effectively silence a .357 Magnum revolver although using a suppressor will reduce the sound of its' muzzle blast a great deal. The dummy that falls from Guzman's penthouse is laughably bad although the stunt where Harry kills Grimes by ramming his bike with his car is excellent. But these are small points. All told it's a wonderful film and if you liked it I would also recommend 'Counterforce' which has a similar storyline but ups the ante by having a vigilante SWAT team.",Magnum Force
91,hnt_dnl,Plays like a TV movie,3,15 November 2015,"MAGNUM FORCE (1973) is a sequel that I just don't get! The original ""Dirty Harry"" is a masterpiece of cinema, a gritty, edgy, engrossing 2-character battle of wits and wills between the anti-heroic Inspector Harry Callahan and Scorpio, but also a memorable indictment of the legal system. This immediate sequel ""Magnum Force"" is the anti-Dirty Harry, having a softer, nicer, more tolerant Harry, again essayed by icon Clint Eastwood, who has mellowed out to the point of seeming like someone else. ""Magnum Force"" has an all too apparent TV movie vibe about it. Ironically, it has actors that would go onto star in popular TV series (Suzanne Somers ""3s Company"", Robert Urich ""Vegas"" and ""Spenser for Hire"", David Soul ""Starsky and Hutch"", and Tim Matheson, certainly nowhere near an A-lister, although he would eventually star in ""Animal House""). Veteran Hal Holbrook is the only movie presence other than Eastwood. Felton Perry admirably plays Harry's new partner, but the casting felt gimmicky. Reni Santoni felt more organic as Harry's partner in the original. Here, it feels like the writers gave him a black partner just to continue the diversity. ""Magnum Force"" literally feels like a typical TV show/movie plot, about vigilante cops who kill ANYONE who breaks the law. The cinematography in this sequel lacks the atmosphere and punch of the original. The killing scenes seem juvenile and happen too abruptly. Scenes cut off too quickly. The idea of all these cops having the same vision and being of one mind stretches the imagination to the point of incredulity. Mitchell Ryan (as a disgruntled veteran cop) is the only actor who acquits himself well in this. The second sequel ""The Enforcer"" did a much better job relaying the message of corruption and ineptitude of the legal system and had a higher entertainment value than this one.",Magnum Force
92,TOMASBBloodhound,Even scumbags at least deserve a trial!,7,3 June 2003,"Spoilers!This 1973 follow up to the 1971 classic ""Dirty Harry"" pits Inspector Harry Callahan against a vigilante group within the SFPD. Eastwood again shines as the squinty-eyed protagonist who attempts to track down the killer or killers of some high profile scumbags. His boss (and arch-nemesis) Lt. Briggs seems convinced the violence is just a bunch of mobsters killing each other off. Clint doesn't but into that theory. He discovers the murders are being committed by a death squad within the police department. And Briggs happens to be their leader!The plot alone is enough to make this one a winner. We have always had police corruption and brutality. This film takes the idea to a new level. Watching Clint figure things out while wading through the typical big city slime is a lot of fun. Clint has a one-liner for almost every scene, and he makes sure plenty of bad guys pay the price for messing with him.This film is quite a bit dated in terms of its clothing, cars, and hair styles. Heck, this film is as old as I am. The ideas it touches on are still as important today as they were back then, though. What qualifies as excessive force by the police? Are even the most hardened crooks worth protecting by our legal system? This film makes the case that they are. Clint, near the conclusion, explains to Briggs that police cannot and should not be judge, jury, and executioner all in one. In other words, even scumbags deserve a fair trial. It's almost as if this film apologizes for Clint's hard core behavior that outraged so many liberals in the original.
Overall, this is a solid entry in the Dirty Harry series. Plenty of action, interesting story, and Eastwood is always a joy to watch.
The film suffers from the fact that it lasts too long, though!3 1/2  of  5 starsSo sayeth the Hound.",Magnum Force

The only thing that has not improved though is the pace. This film too, could have been a lot shorter, making it more of a tight package. Taking everything into account, the people involved really learned from the mistakes that were made in making the first Dirty Harry.

95,ivo-cobra8,The greatest action sequel masterpiece of all time!,10,10 December 2015,"Magnum Force (1973) is the greatest action sequel of all time! Dirty Harry and Magnum Force are my two best favorite sequels of all time. It is one of my personal favorite movies. I always, always enjoy those two movies so much from Clint Eastwood, I grew up watching those two movie and they are the best action movies of all time! I just kept watching them. My second best favorite action flick of all time! The movie had a good edition - good actors in this and Clint was his usual bad ass self. Hal Holbrook is a great villain in this. The flick is proof sequels can be damn fine films and not redundant. It is my favorite entry's of the series and no doubt one of the greats action flicks of the 70's! Magnum Force has...everything. Immortal perfection personified. Hal Holbrook does a marvelous job as do the three rookies who later became famous on their own. Robert Urich and David Soul well-performed the berserk cops. I do believe that Harry ""crosses the line,"" and obviously so do those berserk cops, but unlike them, he never kills innocent by-standers and women.Magnum Force is old school 70's action flick with 'acting' and 'actors...none CGI or special effects in it. It is not that I hate CGI or special effects ...it's just so nice to watch the way it was done. Harry Callahan (Clint Eastwood) goes up against rogue cops here and he never waivers on his 'justice'. Great pistol shooting scenes and very well done film. Eastwood rocks. I forgot to mention Dirty Harry series are more similar to Charles Bronson's Death wish series. In my opinion I enjoy Dirty Harry Series much better than any other action movies. So the film is set when a mysterious wave of killings sweeps the Mafia underworld, it's Inspector ""Dirty Harry"" Callahan who answers with Magnum Force. Despite a demotion by Lt. Neil Briggs for his questionable methods, Harry will stop at nothing to find the killers. A rouge traffic cops are killing criminals who have escaped from court, they killing them brutally and they don't care if they kill an innocent person or not. Those cops are different from Scorpio from previous movie and they are more vicious than psycho sniper Scorpio. A tough, hard-core and explosive action-thriller that gets the job done. It's sharply written and well-constructed action film that has lots of flavor. Clint Eastwood is in top form as Dirty Harry, showing that truly no cop series can stand next to his classic character or these films. Compared to the original, this was a much better movie: The main story and characters were more interesting, the writing was less uneven and the overall pacing was better. It was still quite dated but a lot easier to take than the original. And, once again, I enjoyed the ""retro-ness"" of it. Mr. Eastwood's unshakable cool-as he dismantles a bomb or refuses a local anesthetic for seven stitches. In the film, Harry is certainly not a dictator. The law is. The law decides who lives and who dies. Nor does Harry glorify the state; or in this case, the system. He hates the system--the liberal legal system that has made a mess of things and Harry's the janitor who must clean it up; which makes sense considering his name derives from always getting the dirty jobs. Well, somebody's got to do it. Ironically, he sometimes makes a mess of his own, but delivers efficient results in the end. In Magnum Force, there's some new enforcers in town, and they ride dark horses. If ever a fascistic label could be applied, it's on them. Magnum Force is a 1973 American action film and the second to feature Clint Eastwood as maverick cop Harry Callahan after the 1971 film Dirty Harry. Ted Post, who also directed Eastwood in the television series Rawhide and the feature film Hang 'Em High, directed the film, the second in the Dirty Harry series.I love this movie to death, it is my favorite best sequel of all time, Just like Terminator the first two movies, I love those two sequels to death! This movie deserves 10, it is almost so good as Dirty Harry, the only problem I have with the film is it 2 hrs. long, it could have been shorter. All the actors did a great job acting and the story was amazing. I have enjoy this movie to death and I always will! Throughout, there's a stress on dear old hubris: Harry earnestly repeats that ""a man's got to know his limitations."" Thus, it's reasoned that the killings he commits are justified - ""There's nothing wrong with shooting, as long as the right people get shot"" - but murderers do have to be discriminating. The action scenes are fabulous and the fantastic, the gun play is terrific, you will sea a lot of hand gun use and they are used well.",Magnum Force
96,BroadswordCallinDannyBoy,Clint Eastwood knows his limitations.,8,20 February 2007,"After a known criminal, with clout over the city, manages to escape the punishment of the law, he and his partners are gunned down by a vigilante dressed as a cop and with a .44 Magnum. Drawn to the case Infamous San Francisco Detective ""Dirty"" Harry Callahan starts to investigate as the vigilante continues to take out criminals citywide. Soon there are suspicions that the criminals are getting their information from inside the police force.If there is one actor that can be plainly badass, macho, and tough in the most stereotypical way without making a fool of himself, it's Clint Eastwood. Never has an actor been so plain and stoic, yet so entertaining and funny at the same time. That's because Eastwood knows his limitations and, as a result, never becomes totally ridiculous. Whether he's dropping one liners, shooting his cannon of a revolver, or mysteriously seducing women with no effort whatsoever Clint Eastwood just plays it cool. Steve McQueen also managed the same with his classic ""Bullitt"" and Dirty Harry uses essentially the same formula, but it does it well with its own unique spin and style. Also Clint Eastwood has lived well past McQueen's early death so his films are more prevalent in the current movie mindset.The film isn't quite perfect and there is one sequence in particular - at the airport where Harry takes out two hijackers single handedly - that seems to be just there to show that Harry Callahan is a badass who makes his own rules and gets things done. Yet this scene does nothing to advance the plot. With the film clocking in at over two hours this could have easily been dropped. Along with a few trimmings here and there for a slightly brisker film.That said, the movie remains entertaining and a good part of Eastwood's action era. --- 8/10Rated R for violence",Magnum Force
97,bellino-angelo2014,A great sequel and probably the best entry in the franchise,9,2 February 2021,"I liked the first DIRTY HARRY movie and being a Clint Eastwood fan I decided to watch all the sequels. I have to say that I liked this one even more than the first one.In this installment, a group of four agents that are rookies from the Police Academy and work as patrol officers decide to impose their own law against those who forgive criminals too much. After one dies, Harry is asked a few times to join the other three but he of course refuses. When he returns at home he discovers a bomb in the mail box and manages to avoid it, but his partner is not so lucky. When Harry discusses about it with his boss Neil Briggs (Hal Holbrook) he finds out that Neil is in charge of the motorcycle cop group. Of course he will succedd in his mission of getting rid of them and letting them know who is boss.I liked this entry much more than the predecessor probably because of the suspense factor, the few explosions here and there and Harry's attitude. I especially liked the scene at the beginning when Harry goes in a plane that is ready to take off and he takes the place of one of the pilots and when some thug arrives in the control room, he beats them in front of the control panel!I think this is pretty much what you except from a DIRTY HARRY movie, that's why I think it's probably the best in the franchise.",Magnum Force
98,Maziun,Politically correct Dirty Harry,7,22 June 2013,"This is the second movie in the series . It's the best rated of all sequels , yet I think this one is along with ""The Dead pool "" the weakest one from all Harry Callahan movies .The screenplay was written by John Milius (""Conan the Barbarian"") and Michael Cimino (""The Deer hunter"") . ""Dirty Harry"" was a controversial movie for some people (Roger Ebert (RIP) called it a fascist movie ) , but commercially successful . It seems that ""Magnum force"" was supposed to calm the critics of ""DH"" by showing that he's not that bad at all. That he works in unconventional ways , but he's not above the system . So , in this one the villains are evil cops (to be honest I wouldn't mind if in REAL LIFE cops would kill criminals with cold blood and no court ) . His new partner is very likable black cop ( Felton Perry – Johnson from ""Robocop"" ) and his new girlfriend is Asian .The movie is too slowly paced . The action scenes lack excitement . The plot twists aren't exactly impressive . The whole movie lacks the passion of the first . ""Magnum force"" feels like a conventional good cop versus bad cops movie , unlike the groundbreaking ""Dirty Harry"" . Not to mention that the opening credits are terribly lame.Some of the shootouts look really nice . The dialogues are witty. The acting is good. The music by Lalo Schiffrin is quite fun. The characters are interesting.Overall , it's a nice movie that just doesn't have too much power . I give it 7/10.",Magnum Force

A series of vigilante murders if you like.An admirable music score by Lalo Schifrin, better known for scoring the Mission: Impossible theme.The film showcases yet again how cool Clint was in the 1970s era, despite the aged fashions and gas guzzling station wagons!If it wasn't for the screen presence of Eastwood this would be a standard TVM rather than a big budget cinema release. No wonder Dirty Harry director Don Siegel passed director duties over to Ted Post.Look out for a pre Starsky and Hutch appearance by David Soul as one of the vigilante cops.An easy watch on late night TV broadcasts but not as polished as Dirty Harry.

So when I saw the second movie (this one) I was wondering weather or not it would reach my high expectations. Sure enough it did. This movie it so great in it's story and characters that it just about reaches the first one. In this one Inspector Harry Callahan (Clint Eastwood) the cop that's admired as much as feared by his fellow officers is inspecting the deaths of known criminals who seem to have been killed by vigilantes. His superior officer Lieutenant Neil Briggs (Hal Holbrook) clearly disproves of the ways that Harry solves his cases, but has no choice but to let him. Meanwhile Harry begins to suspect that these criminals may have been killed by other officers. I won't give away the answer but I'm sure that you'll be surprised who they were. What makes this film great is the writing which is just as good as the last one. The acting is also great in this one too.

Much like the Death Wish movies we've grown to love, our vigilantes here wear badges ridding scum who beat the courts. ""There is no other way"" as one cop blatantly says to Inspector Harry Callahan in menacing calm. Harry ends this chilling conservation by saying ""I'm afraid you've misjudged me"". It's great to see Eastwood square off with Holbrook, a jealous Seargeant, who has his own secret, that's a shocking revelation near it's end where a few mob guys have got their just deserts throughout the film by our magnum force. Eastwood kind of befriends four of them, two of them played by a younger David Soul and Tim Matheson. Brilliant shooters as they are, could they also be involved. Harry, the only one that believes these killings are traffic cops lays this story on his black partner, (Felton Perry) who sadly becomes sacrificed, in a bomb explosion, his letterbox rigged, where luckily Harry beats death again, after his Asian girlfriend is shoved away while almost about to open it. This Dirty Harry movie is so well made, it's makers should be applauded, plus it's scriptwriters, and like a lot of other movies, I haven't video'd for a long time, it's last line of dialogue by Eastwood stays me, that rings so true, as does this as being great entertainment.",Magnum Force

First off, it's probably one of the best sequels I have ever seen. It's hard to follow 'Dirty Harry' (1971), and it would have been easy to screw this up by changing cities too soon, or making Harry a 'nice guy'. Although Harry is noticeably less racist, he isn't a nice guy. I can justify the lack of blatant racism in the sequel based on the character being in trouble at work all the time, and probably trying to tone it down since his demotion/transfer. The reality is, the movie was a hit, and they didn't want to promote a racist-murderer-vigilate-cop. The location shooting was great, for the second time, and they killed people in entertaining ways all over San Fransisco. I could have given points for Clint Eastwood's performance, but he played the same character that was already a hit, and he played it the same way. Instead, I awarded points for believability and consistency - it was more believable than the first film, yet very consistent to the character. All in all, a great film featuring an iconic character.RealReview Posting Scoring Criteria:

109,Cinemaniac1984,Clint Eastwood is back as Dirty Harry Callahan in Magnum Force.,8,16 May 2015,"Clint Eastwood returns in his iconic role as the unorthodox SFPD Inspector Harry Callahan in Magnum Force, the sequel to the classic crime caper Dirty Harry (1971). Although Magnum Force not a groundbreaking classic compared to Dirty Harry, you can't deny the fact that it is still an enjoyable movie and it was great to see Harry Callahan return onto the screen.This time, Inspector Harry Callahan finds himself on the right side of the law when he finds himself hot on the trail of a secret group of vigilante cops who are going against the system and murdering San Francisco's high profile criminals who have managed to evade justice. Magnum Force opens with mobster Carmine Ricca (Richard Devon) driving away from court after being acquitted on a technicality for the murders of a labour union leader and his family. After Carmine Ricca manages to escape from the clutches of angry mob protesters outside the courthouse, his limousine is stopped by an SFPD Motorcycle Police Officer for a traffic violation. Without warning, the motorcycle officer draws his revolver out of his holster and guns down Carmine Ricca, his attorney, bodyguard and his driver in cold blood all while in broad daylight. The motorcycle officer then calmly returns to his motorcycle and rides away from the crime scene.Inspector Harry Callahan (Clint Eastwood) and his partner Inspector Early Smith (Felton Perry, Robocop) drive by the crime scene however are turned away by Lieutenant Neil Briggs (Hal Holbrook, Wall Street), telling Callahan his presence is unwanted as he has been temporarily reassigned from Homicide to Stakeout. Callahan and Briggs have a history of butting heads with each other, not only with their contrasting views of police work but also with their personalities. Lieutenant Briggs prides himself on not having once drawn his revolver in the line of duty to which Callahan flippantly responds ""Well, you're a good man Lieutenant. A good man always knows his limitations"". Briggs looks on at Callahan in disgust with his attitude problem.While visiting a fast food shop run by a retired officer who is a friend of Callahan's at the San Francisco International Airport, Callahan notices a distress signal being broadcast over the PA system and airport security are frantically dealing with a plane hijacking and the hijackers are demanding a pilot. After Callahan sneaks on board the place disguised as a pilot he manages to disarm one hijacker after he casually admits that he has never had a flying lesson and guns down the second hijacker. With the hijacking crisis over as Callahan casually exits the plane, Lieutenant Briggs and the SFPD arrive on the scene. Callahan mockingly asks a fuming Briggs ""What are you doing here, Lieutenant?"", further escalating tensions between the pair.Later at a shooting range Callahan bumps into an old friend of his, traffic officer Charlie McCoy (Mitchell Ryan, Lethal Weapon). McCoy is an embittered person who is separated from his wife and appears to be suicidal and unstable. Inside the range, Callahan meets a close knit quartet of rookie police officers who are also excellent sharpshooters. The group consists of Phil Sweet (Tim Matheson, Animal House), John Davis (David Soul, TV's Starsky & Hutch), Donald ""Red"" Astrachan (Kip Niven, Earthquake), and Mike Grimes (the late Robert Urich, TV's Spenser: For Hire). The group strike Callahan as a young and idealistic group of officers with promising futures and in return they look up to Harry Callahan.Briggs allows Callahan to return to Homicide when the bodies continue to pile up with a massacre of party goers at a gangster's pool party, a pimp (Albert Popwell who previously appeared in Dirty Harry as the wounded bank robber who finds himself asking does he feel lucky when on the wrong end of Callahan's .44 Magnum) after he brutally murders one of his prostitutes at the back of a cab, and a drug kingpin and his associates in their luxurious apartment.Callahan has suspicions that there is a secret death squad operating within the San Francisco Police Department and a group of renegade motorcycle police officers are dispensing their own brand of justice. However, Callahan's efforts in exposing the vigilante police officers are hampered by Lieutenant Briggs and his denial that such a group exists, instead pointing towards another mobster in San Francisco organising these hits.It was an absolute joy to see Clint Eastwood return in his iconic role as SFPD Inspector Harry Callahan. It was also good to see actors such as David Soul, Tim Matheson, Robert Ulrich, Hal Holbrook, and Felton Perry go on to bigger and better things, in particular David Soul who carved out a successful TV career with Starsky & Hutch and proved he was not just a pretty face by adding another string to his bow with a successful career as a singer with the hit song ""Don't Give Up On Us"" which topped the music charts in 1976. Suzanne Somers (TV's Three's Company) appears uncredited as a pool girl in the ill fated pool party massacre and Carl Weathers (Rocky) appears uncredited as a protester at the start of the movie.Writers John Milus (Apocalypse Now, Conan The Barbarian) and Michael Cimino (The Deer Hunter, Heaven's Gate) have done an excellent job bringing the story to the big screen as well as the return of Harry Callahan and director Ted Post has to be commended on an excellent job taking over the director's reigns from Don Siegel.Although some parts I found to be violent despite being over 40 years old, Magnum Force is an excellent movie that is a worthy entry in the Dirty Harry legacy.8/10.",Magnum Force

111,Bogey Man,First sequel to the classic,7,23 July 2002,"Ted Post directed and John Milius and Michael Cimino wrote this first sequel to Don Siegel's classic gritty police drama, Dirty Harry (1971). Magnum Force (1973) is not as near as effective or powerful as the first and original film, but this sequel is watchable and has its merits, too. Harry is now investigating strange killings of criminals, pimps, dirty politicians and others, so the killer is killing ""bad guys"" this time. Harry starts to investigate the cases, and he has his doubts about all this. Then the truth is revealed and also, unfortunately, spoilt in most of the reviews and comments I've read.Harry has again his usual opponents, mostly his colleagues and superiors who don't accept his tough style. Harry wants to do justice, but by using his own ways and moral. If talking doesn't help, then the magnum .44 will. I don't think this or the first film are fascist, but realistic and honest, and extremely bleak depictions of world and society which is more or less collapsing because of its inhabitants. This film manages still to tell something about that, but the next sequel, The Enforcer, is pretty lame in comparison.Magnum Force has pretty fat plot and many different characters and sub plots, without being too confusing. Towards the end, the film becomes perhaps too predictable and unbelievable, and I think the ending should have needed little tightening. Now it is little unnecessary shoot outs and nothing else. The film runs two hours, which is the longest running time in the ""series"", but still this manages to interest and even surprise, but if they had finished the film some 20 minutest earlier, this would be even more noteworthy film. Now it has nothing too important to offer during its finale, and so the finale becomes little unnecessary, in my opinion.As an action film, this is pretty exciting and shot with talent. The action scenes are often fast and full of gunpowder and fire, so director Post can surely direct with skill. The film is pretty brutal and violent at times, and this again shows the fact that films this gritty and violent are not made in Hollywood nowadays, at least not too often. Magnum Force is much more easier and ""positive"" film than its predecessor, and that's why it hasn't got so many things to offer and give. This is pure action film where the first film was also many other things, too, like social commentary and talking about things many would not want to talk about. Magnum Force gets 7/10, but fortunately still has its positive things and even little bit of the power that made Dirty Harry so immortal.",Magnum Force

The time line on this film I would like to say is probably a month or too after solving The Scorpio case, just a guesstimate.The Movie is about rouge cops cleaning up the scum of the city by killing them once they are free from prison/jail. You will find out later in the movie that Lt. Bressler, Hal Holbrook, is the ringleader of the bunch. This has vigilantism written all over it; and it wouldn't surprise me if this or something like it was ever tried in real life.Lt. Bressler grooming young academy grads, into police killing machines. They are motorcycle officer's who, find the cities worst criminals track them down and clean the city of their filth so to speak.

115,eshwarmail,Goes one up from the original but fizzles out in the climax.,7,3 November 2012,"While the previous edition is also mainstream, this edition is more audience friendly bordering on the action-comedy genre (just shades of contained comedy). The thriller element is more developed and Harry is a known character where the screenplay doesn't need to waste time introducing him again. But right when this one was going to overshadow the original, it fizzles out with its weak climax.While Harry (Clint Eastwood) still goes by his reputation of an unconventional trigger happy cop, a new form of 'terror' engulfs the city where criminals are being put down by a vigilante. Harry is being suppressed by his Lieutenant Briggs (Hal Holbrook) and he is assigned a new partner Early Smith (Felton Perry). When he watches a bunch of talented rookies in the shooting range, it gives him an idea.This is way more suspenseful while the antagonist is mysterious and powerful. Eastwood goes one up from his original performance by bringing in a subtle comic element to his character but at times oversteps on the space reserved for Chuck Norris, take the hijack drama for example. The screenplay is stuffed with twists and turns which makes it breezy and the rest of the characters too put in an apt performance except for Hal Holbrook who resorts to a caricature. Though the climax is quite revealing in the writing perspective, the action sequences and the actual implementation in disclosing the plot is mediocre. There is a small tabla melody introduced for the aforementioned comic subtlety that gels well with the overall background score. A lot more characters are introduced compared to the first edition, his romantic interest comes and leaves without a head and a tail.Goes one up from the original but fizzles out in the climax.",Magnum Force

120,garyldibert,Great Movie But No Leading Actress,8,4 July 2008,"TITLE: MAGNUM FORCE was release in theaters in the United States on Christmas Day in 1973 and time on this movie was 124 minutes. Clint Eastwood, Hal Holbrook, and Mitch Ryan Magnum Force is the 1973 sequel to the 1971 Dirty Harry film, starring Hal Holbrook, Mitvh Ryan and Clint Eastwood returning as maverick cop Harry Callahan. The film was released in 1973 and directed by Ted Post, who also directed Eastwood in TV's Rawhide and the feature film Hang 'Em High. The screenplay was written by John Milius (who provided an unaccredited rewrite for the original film) and Michael Cimino. This film features early appearances by David Soul, Tim Matheson, and Robert Urich as the vigilante traffic cops. It is also the longest Dirty Harry film, clocking in at 124 minutes.SUMMARY: Carmine Ricca (Richard Devon), a known organized-crime kingpin, drives away from a court case where he was declared not guilty for a massacre of a whole family. Soon after, a motorcycle traffic cop stops Ricca's car and begins to write out a ticket for the driver, saying he had ""crossed the double-line"". Suddenly, the cop pulls his service revolver, a .357 Magnum, shoots all four men in the car, and then calmly drives off. Later, ""Dirty"" Harry Callahan (Clint Eastwood) and his new partner Earlington Smith (Felton Perry) stop by to check out the crime scene, but Harry is no longer working in homicide due to his handling of the Scorpio case in the first film. Harry butts heads with his new superior, Lieutenant Briggs (Hal Holbrook), who orders him to return to his assigned stakeout. Harry instead takes his new partner to the airport for the ""best hamburgers in town"". At the airport, he foils an aircraft hijacking, by impersonating a pilot that the hijackers were demanding. When one of the hijackers is distracted as Harry goes through the motions of preparing the plane for take-off, he slams on the brakes and takes the hijacker's gun after punching him unconscious, and shoots the first one dead. Back at the police academy, Harry encounters his friend Charlie McCoy (Mitchell Ryan), a fellow cop who is despondent, having just separated from his wife. When Harry suggests Charlie should retire, McCoy angrily vows never to do so, but to ""go out fighting."" At a shooting range Harry meets a group of rookie motorcycle police officers, fresh from the Airborne Army Rangers, United States Army Special Forces, and out of the police academy: Philip Sweet (Tim Matheson), John Davis (David Soul), ""Red"" Astrachan (Kip Niven), and Michael Grimes (Robert Urich). Meanwhile, more killings by the motorcycle traffic cops occur, including the murder of a murderous pimp (Albert Popwell) who killed one of his own prostitutes, and a host of underworld members at a private house party. Harry and his partner are transferred back to homicide. From the clues, he finds Harry thinks the killer is a traffic cop, and begins to suspect his despondent friend Charlie McCoy. Harry visits Charlie's wife and kids and finds out McCoy has been suicidal and living with a stripper. McCoy's wife makes a pass at him, but Early calls Harry and informs him a robbery at the store where they've been on stakeout is about to take place. Harry travels to the store and enters the back way, viewing the suspects through a one-way glass. The robbery takes place, but Harry, Early, and another police officer foil the robbers, killing all but one of them who gets away in a car.QUESTIONS: Why does Harry think a Motorcycle cop committed the murder? Why was Charlie McCoy killed? Why did Harry turn his attention to towards the rookie cops? Why did Harry lose the shooting competition? Why was mob boss Frank Palancio the prime suspect? What was Lt Briggs hiding? What was planted in Harry mailbox? MY THOUGHTS: I thought this movie was great because of the on the edge of your sit suspense. There's plenty of action and drama involve in this movie also. Based on the action and the suspense itself I give this movie 8 weasel stars. The only thing this movie lacked was a leading woman and that's why it doesn't get a 10.",Magnum Force
121,rhinocerosfive-1,"yeah, but who hasn't wanted to drive a car into David Soul?",5,28 October 2007,"Dumb, dumb and dumb, violent, lurid, with just a fleck of style for slickness. This was not the best writing Cimino or Milius ever did, though if they'd been allowed to direct... who knows. Cimino soon directed ""Thunderbolt and Lightfoot"", one of the great unknown 70s crime movies, and superior in every way to this predictable yarn; Milius did ""The Wind and the Lion"", a boring piece of crap. Then they went on to direct a couple of really good movies apiece. But we got Ted Post.Veteran ""Gunsmoke"", ""Rawhide"" and ""Combat"" TV director Post manages to make this clunker barely appealing by sticking to the most superficial and prurient elements of the original ""Dirty Harry"" formula and giving them some gas. The car hitting the motorcycle is pretty good. The execution of the pimp and the shoot-out at the docks are thrilling, in a cheap way. We get nude scenes with not only Suzanne Somers but Cliff Pellow, which you can't say about every film. And Hal Holbrook is the best actor who's ever been in a Dirty Harry movie.

122,blakiepeterson,"An Excellent ""Dirty Harry"" Sequel",8,15 July 2015,"Unless you're Oliver Queen or the brooding anti-hero star of a comic book serial, don't expect the idea of Taking the Law Into Your Own Hands to work out after months of trying. Cops can get awfully irritable, and messing with the heat isn't a game worth playing — especially when you've got Inspector Harry Callahan (Clint Eastwood) hot on your trail. He's got a .44 Magnum Revolver, and he isn't afraid to play a tricky game of Russian Roulette with you if you don't quit it.The villain of this ""Dirty Harry"" sequel is not a deranged sniper but a vigilante posing as a traffic cop. He doesn't figure himself to be crazy; he finds his actions to be methodical. His favorite hobby involves hunting down the thugs who escape jail time and offing them — since the law can't manage to lock them up (the first few minutes of the film witness outrage following the release of a murderer, based on a technicality), why not do the dirty work and rid the city of the vermin that corrupts it? The foe figures he's doing San Francisco a favor, but Harry can see through the bullshit — the guy's a madman looking for an excuse to justify his madness; who knows how long it'll be before he starts shooting jaywalkers? So he and his partner (Felton Perry) try to strip away all the false leads and find out what the real deal is, as their Lieutenant (Hal Holbrook) remains skeptical of Harry's unconventional ways.Some find the ""Dirty Harry"" movies to be too questionable in their ethics to really enjoy, but I find their thunderous grittiness to be gigantically entertaining. Clint Eastwood is the ultimate anti-hero, his perpetual machismo convincingly charged. He's a man bred to seek justice, too old and worn to consider the confines of the rules. Harry is ruthless, stoic, street smart — Eastwood is so mesmerizing in the role because he doesn't have to emote. His lined face and subtle emotional scars speak louder than the limited stretches of dialogue he has to deliver.""Magnum Force"" is a such an excellent sequel because it builds on what made ""Dirty Harry"" made so great; we hardly need character development here, considering all we need to know is that Harry Callahan is a cop you don't want to mess with. The thrills are leaner and meaner, the screenplay without filler, the characterizations fiendishly simple — even the villain menaces more than the previous scoundrel, as his identity is kept secret until the unpredictable truth is let out. Things might not be as rugged as they were before — Ted Post, replacing Don Siegel, prefers an adventuresome tone in comparison to the first's sinister bloodlust — but ""Magnum Force"" is an appealing sequel that delivers the turbo-charged thrills one wants, one expects. But its quality — that's what makes it strong enough to work on its own.",Magnum Force
123,gilligan1965,"My favorite in the ""Dirty Harry"" series.",8,21 May 2015,"Ever since I saw this at the drive-in as a kid I've liked it. It's an action movie, that, in my opinion, is one of the better ones.I'm so happy that Clint Eastwood was chosen to play Harry Callahan even though all of the others whom it was offered to before him are all great and legendary actors as well. If John Wayne, Frank Sinatra, Marlon Brandon, Steve McQueen, or, Paul Newman would have taken the role, the series wouldn't have lasted as long as it did. Clint Eastwood has kept his youth throughout this series, and, when the time came, refused to reprise the role as he thought it would become a parody.Can anyone imagine Marlon Brando in ""The Dead Pool"" (1988) at the age of 64, barely strong enough to hold up a .44 Magnum with one hand, rolling through the streets of San Fransisco in a wheelchair while being chased by one of those remote-control cars!?!? Or, Frank Sinatra doing the same at 73!?!? John Wayne at 81!?!?SPOILER ALERT - Deep down, although they won't admit it, I believe that most people think that what those cops in this movie were doing was good...and, it was. They saved the courts time; the prisons space; and, the taxpayers money...all the while making the streets much more safe for good people and much more dangerous for criminals whom everyone knew were as guilty as sin. However, when they killed one of their own, opinions of them were swiftly changed...and, this is where vigilantism becomes a problem. That particular killing 'had' to be written into the script so that this movie wouldn't come across as promoting vigilante activity (as in the ""Death Wish"" movies); and, at the same time, making the star, Callahan, a 'law-abiding' hero.I like the ""Dirty Harry"" series, but, I find this one to be my favorite.Overall, I give it 8 stars; but, as an action movie, I give it ten.",Magnum Force

When Harry chances upon a bunch of rookies practising at the firing lane in the early hours, he is duly impressed and seems to aspire to be more like them.Simultaneously, the major players in San Francisco's criminal underworld are being slain one by one and, whilst the violence of the crimes is abhorred, the choice of victims is approved of by many.Soon after, Harry is approached by the group of rookies, who ask him to join them in their bid to 'clean up' the city and, when he refuses, a showdown is sure to follow soon enough.It's a good film, steeped in atmosphere and tension, with some truly glorious shots of San Francisco circa 1973, though it doesn't captivate in quite the way the original managed.

Of the 5 films I would say The Dead Pool is the weakest and Magnum Force is the best. Dirty Harry is a brilliant character who is portrayed superbly by Clint Eastwood. Each film has the right amount of action in it as well as a drama and suspense side. Harry Callahan is also quite a funny character who will do things his own way. There may be consequences but he'll get it done. The supporting cast is also generally good.I watched these 5 films in the space of a week and they were great. Of course they are old films but they have stood up to the test of time. I really liked Magnum Force the best, the plot for that one was really unique and quite brutal. Without giving too much away all I would say is that I recommend you to watch all 5 Dirty Harry films. I feel that they are extremely underrated on IMDb. Dirty Harry – 8.5/10. Magnum Force – 9/10.

128,stp43,Dirty Harry Takes On Vigilantes,8,6 November 2003,"Clint Eastwood returned to the role of Inspector Harry Callahan in 1973, and perhaps stung by claims the original Dirty Harry was fascist, Eastwood and company added a different angle to Harry Callahan's encounters with varied perps in the streets and bowels of San Francisco.Labor racketeer Carmine Ricca beats an indictment for murder due to a technicality, and a traffic policeman watches a news report on the incident before heading out to work.  Later, a traffic cop pulls over Ricca and asks to see his license and registration - and while Ricca's driver gets the required paperwork, the traffic cop unholsters his .357 and blasts the occupants of the car.It's the kind of open-air murder that would be investigated by Harry Callahan and his new partner, Earlington ""Early"" Smith, except that Callahan's new CO, Lieutenant Neil Briggs, had had Harry and Early transferred to Stakeout, and Briggs wants nothing to do with Harry's brand of police work - even after an airport hijacking is foiled by Callahan.Harry then renews acquaintances with his friend Charlie McCoy, whose life has deteriorated following a divorce, and he also meets four rookie traffic cops who practice marksmanship incessently and who as Early explains ""stick together like flypaper."" The first third of the film pulls an interesting balancing act - when the vigilante cop massacres a mobster's pool party, a few minutes later Harry and Early get involved in a liquor store holdup that leaves three perps dead.  Two acts of violence by the vigilante are balanced by two actions by Harry and Early stopping criminals.  It is as if the film seeks to reassure the audience that the SFPD is by no means helpless at stopping violent crime even as the vigilante works his havoc.Eventually, after the death of a pimp who killed one of his girls (one of the more genuinely gruesome scenes of the Harry series), Harry and Early are transferred back to homicide to help in the investigation, and as the two officers tail shipping racketeer Frank Palancio Harry begins to doubt the department's theory that Palancio and fellow mobsters masquerading as police officers - doubts aggravated when a raid on Palancio's dockside offices triggers a firefight that leaves several people dead.The film's deliberate emphasis on the dark side of vigilantism is quite effective and brings to the fore Harry's real motive as a cop - he may have to break societal rules to stop criminals society lets free, but he knows that ""The System"" is still what seperates civilization from barbarism.",Magnum Force
129,glenn-aylett,Dirty Harry With A Twist,9,20 February 2016,"This is a more than competent follow up to Dirty Harry, where a group of rookie cops are taking out gangsters, pimps and other low lives in San Francisco. However, when Dirty Harry refuses to join them, they turn on him, planting a bomb in his mailbox and killing his partner. Also it seems they have an intrinsic dislike of the permissive society and take out a group of people at a pool party and have an ally in Harry's boss, Lt Briggs, played by Hal Holbrook, who captures Harry at gunpoint when he finds out he's not supporting the young vigilantes. In Harry's eyes, for all the system is rotten, vigilante law is not the answer and he has to uphold the law, where you'd expect him to support the police death squad.Magnum Force is good in other respects, the brutal shooting of a gangster who is acquitted for murder by one of the renegade cops is unexpected, the chase scene at the end where Harry dispenses of the vigilante cops on a disused aircraft carrier( including karate chopping one of them to death) is first rate, and Harry also stops an aircraft hijack. As ever, Lalo Schifrin provides a first class soundtrack and look out for David Soul in his first starring role as one of the renegade cops.Again there are some memorable quotes, most notably one where Harry's Japanese American neighbour asks him what she has to do to get into bed with him, "" just knock at the door"", is his quick response in one of the quickest seductions ever. Also as the film ends and Harry's boss is blown up by a car bomb planted by Harry, he states, "" man's gotta know his limitations"".

130,gottogorunning,Not As Good As The First,6,13 August 2005,"""Magnum Force"" - the second in a series of five Dirty Harry movies - suffers some ""sequelitis"". It tries to keep to the spirit of the original, but forces itself to attempt to change some elements to distinguish itself from it's predecessor.""Magnum Force"" is about corrupt officers acting as vigilantes. This is an alright idea - it's been done elsewhere - but the central ""villains"" of the piece aren't half as sinister, or effective, as the killer in the original movie. The killer there was quite ""freaky"" - for want of a better word - but here the villains are just cold, relatively faceless and characterless men. That's not a good idea. As well as the main story-line both movies features Harry getting involved in a few story-lines. ""Magnum Force"" doesn't succeed here quite as well - there's a ridiculously implausible air hijack fiasco for example. The scenes aren't permeated with Harry's black humor either, which renders them mostly into excuses to engage in random acts of violence.Having said all that above, ""Magnum Force"" is still enjoyable. Eastwood has no problem playing Harry - just place a sneer on your face. It's nice to see that Harry actually enjoys the company of others and cares about people - the family he visits, his partner, the neighboring girl - and there are one or two lines in it that raised a smile (though none approaching the classic status of ""I know what you're thinking - did he fire..""). The directing is trying too much, at times, to be involved (notice the shaky camera motions at the beginning, emulating - and failing to - the ""madness"" of the crowd) but it's never very much over-the-top. All in all it's not at all bad, not really that good.",Magnum Force

The gun fight at Frank Palancio's hideout was very good, and the chase finale was solid and is one of the better car chases out there. Also, I thought the plot was well written. I liked the whole idea of vigilante cops taking on Dirty Harry, even though hes been considered a vigilante at times.

132,charlessmith702210,"This is a bit better than the first ""Dirty Harry"" because there is more revelation inside the protagonist",10,7 November 2013,"The way the movie starts is unlike any other I have seen. The end of ""Dirty Harry"" involves last kill-off by Harry Callahan's .44 Magnum pistol, and we see the actual gun with a red background in the beginning. The gun fires at you at the end of the introduction and you are shocked by the gun's power, preceded by probably one of the most famous lines by Harry in ""Dirty Harry""--which in turn was the final line of that movie, which ended with ""Don't you feel lucky?...""So, basically, the movie covers the San Francisco Police Department but in a very ugly way. The force's motorcycle-driving personnel, who had usually only a few years on the force, had already formed a death squad where they do this M.O.--make a traffic stop on hardened criminals with their police bikes that the courts cannot prosecute, and then kill these criminals off with usually a .357 magnum.Sometimes, the killing of these hardened criminals involves automatic weapons and explosives and not a sneaky traffic stop. Hence the pool scene where I guess a member of a SF mob--probably a mob boss--was having a very private party there. Suzanne Sommers made a cameo appearance in that scene. But here comes the unknown rookie bike cop, armed with a black bag and parts of a automatic UZI that he fits together, going up to the party to spoil it. He opens the bag, and sets off a smoke container (which in turn sets off a delay fuse for a plastic explosive inside), and throws it into the water as a distraction. Then, he fires automatic bullets into the pool party crowd, killing 10 of them but 5 more survive, but they all get dead when the plastic explosive blows up, creating a very big geyser of water as well as a loud boom. And then silence. The pool party is fatally over. The cop had done his dirty job, goes down the hill, gets on his Harley, and speeds away without getting caught because he was a cop.This scene was probably the first turning point in this movie--you are shocked with that unjustified killing by a cop who went beyond the laws of deadly force. Callahan would have liked it that way but he would not have too much guts to do that.When Harry Callahan sees the evidence in the first of these death-squad-like killings that put hardened criminal Antoine Ricca to death in a limousine at point-blank range, Lt. Briggs is very quick to target Callahan as probably the killer of Ricca, but backs off a little bit. Harry's sidekick police officer, Early, soaks up a little bit of what Harry's thoughts about the SFPD using beyond-the-law tactics.Just near the end of the movie, Callahan then faces a few of the unknown rookie bike cops in his apartment garage, who tells him the reason why they did their unjustified killings. Callahan then retorts that he is against their ways, they speed off, and then, those cops make a sneaky revenge later.They almost kill Callahan with a mail bomb in his apartment mailbox, probably as revenge for what Callahan said to them, but Callahan was smart--detecting a suspicious red flashing dot inside the box and he knew what to do...take the mailbox apart and then, he revealed a plastic explosive armed with a timer. He pulls it out carefully and stops the timer before the bomb would blow. The movie does not tell you if Harry was part of the SFPD Bomb Squad but by the way he disarms the bomb, you find out that Harry is very insidiously smart. He is not just a regular cop that you would guess he would be.",Magnum Force

136,Theflyace,A Surprisingly very Good Sequel to a Great Film,8,23 September 2013,"Since Dirty Harry is one of my all-time favorite films, I wasn't exactly looking forward to any of the sequels that were produced. Fortunately, ""Magnum Force"" really succeeds as a sequel. It is not a rehash of ""Dirty Harry,"" but a different kind of take on the iconic S.F. Inspector with the big gun.A year after the Scorpio case, a new threat takes to the streets of San Francisco, in the form or rogue Motrocycle cops, who begin a killing spree of all the city's top crime lords. Inspector Harry Callahan (who somehow has kept his job after the events of ""Dirty Harry"") is on the investigation. His superior Lt. Briggs (played by the very good Hal Holbrook) sees him as a reckless cop who is dangerous in any situation. But Briggs is not all peace and diplomacy as he may seem though. After evidence begins to indicate that a cop (or more) may be involved, he is confronted by said ""Magnum Force"" to join them to rid the city of all crime.This film, written brilliantly by Michael Cimino and John Millius, adds a new layer to Harry's character. When confronted by the cops involved, they remind him of his hate for the law and the red tape that would allow the crime lords to walk free and keep doing what they are doing. However, Harry will not resort to complete vigilantism, and will try to stick to the law, even if he ""hates the goddamn system, but until someone comes along with some changes that make sense he'll stick with it."" The reason why I give this aspect of the film so much praise is that it fleshes out Harry's character a little bit more,showing him as a cop who will protect his city but with limits on what he will do. That is why i love the line ""A man's got to know his limitations."" He uses it on Brigg's at the beginning as a joke (much like his ""Do You Feel Lucky, Punk?) But also like that quote, in the end when all villains are revealed and taken care of, it has much more significance.One thing that is is escalated in ""Magnum Force"" is the action scenes, with car chases, and even a airplane-hijacking. These scenes work very well, and keep in context with the story. The climax on the old aircraft carrier is a very good scene to, very tense, and very dark as it would be on a ship like that.This sequel wouldn't work unless you had some good acting, and the acting here is very good actually. Eastwood is still in top form as Harry, and gets more emotion and conflict during this film than he did in the last one, especially when his reputation is called into play and what he believes in is questioned. The men who play the bike-cops are very good, and they include David Soul (before he played Hutch) All all played as rookies, and very convincingly. Hal Holbrook is great as always playing a very snide and very proud Lt. Briggs.This sequel really works. it may be a bit rough around the edges, and dare I say, a little too long to play out. However, I like this movie very much. it's one of those rare sequels that really works as entertainment, but offers something that extra bit more.",Magnum Force
137,KingBrian1,Deadly,9,24 January 2015,"This film is a message about anti-authoritarianism, vigilante justice perpetrated by corrupt cops. From the get go the leading officer is ""Dirty Harry"" from the original film. This guy solves problems by operating outside the law. His contempt for law enforcement blends with his determination to inflict punishment on the cities criminals. His two cop companions one a rookie both killed. He is partly responsible for the deaths of cops in the line of duty due in part due to his reckless behaviour. The death squad traffic cops are the villains of the film riding around the city essentially culling the crime bosses. These fascists are Harry's worst nightmare, descent cops who have turned to murderers in order to serve their own desire to rid the city of its unwanted elements. Finally we come to the deceptive head of the cops. We learn he is the mastermind of the conspiracy. It goes all the way to the top totally undermining the trust of the police force in the city of San Francisco.The film follows a sequence of events in which the cops are portrayed first as a moral force that is good but this is short lasting as we see the murder rate increasing with their assassinations. Then we see Harry's style of crook catching when he foils a robbery, violent but effective. The cop's intentions become known when they kill a fellow cop and after a brief interlude of gun shooting scenes which would satisfy the National Rifles Association we return to the menace of the cops and Harry's task to find the culprits of his friend's murder. He is too late and faces off against his superior and proceeds to eliminate the traffic cops one by one. Towards the end the idea that he is fighting to stop the corrupt cops disappears and it becomes a straight forward survival movie in which he is fighting to stay alive.The interesting thing about this movie is that in hindsight it is full of ambiguous characters none of whom are really good. Dirty Harry is more reckless than a good cop. A total of seven cops are killed. Harry personally kills four cops. Nobody complains that the crime bosses were killed at the beginning but all of a sudden at the end the cops become evil when they decide to kill off Harry and his partner. What this movie does demonstrate is that by putting a police force under the spot light secrecy is exposed. This movie is about how not to run a police department. In this way it is a great movie on police brutality and generally the police forces attitudes towards the citizens it serves.",Magnum Force
138,dgrahamwatson,"""Magnum force will make your day!""",9,1 October 2009,"If you were to ask film goer's which character or movie they would associate with Clint Eastwood it would probably be his portrayal of the no-nonsense crime buster inspector Harry Callahan. Of course Eastwood had done some very popular movies prior to this including his spaghetti westerns in the 1960's and even after the Harry Callahan run he has gone on to do some well acclaimed films in front of as well as behind the camera. It's worth mentioning this because despite being well into his seventies he's still in demand as actor and director which is a testament to his movie making abilities and longevity that spans fifty years! All in all an impressive achievement. Be that as it may, when you play the character of Harry Callahan five times over an 18 year period it's hard for fans not to associate him with the part.MAGNUM FORCE might actually be a tad better than DIRTY HARRY as well as being the best of the sequels. Not only do we learn a bit more about Inspector Callahan but also it's a more interesting and compelling story as well as having a better all round cast. Well, at least it seems that way as time has gone by, because the supporting cast of David Soul, Tim Matheson and Robert Urich who play the easy-going traffic cops would go on to be well known stars in their own right through the 70's, 80's, 90's and 2000's. In addition they are backed up by the brilliant Hal Holbrook playing the impatient and easily irritated lieutenant Briggs.Tough street wise cops were not a new thing to Hollywood, but because of the civil rights movements in the 1960's and 70's there were a lot of new rules that the police had to adhere to and their methods came under greater judicial scrutiny. If there was a whiff of wrong doing, the judge would instruct that critical testimony should be dismissed and vital evidence rendered inadmissible thus making the DA's prosecution impossible and an acquittal or a dismissal of a case a certainty. They had rights! As a consequence it seemed that the courts became a sanctuary or a get out of jail card for the criminals! Also, rather than having some dopey public defender the criminals gained access to the new breed of wise-guy smarmy lawyers who would use all forms of court room trickery to gain acquittals for their clients. Whether it was organized crime, pimps, murderers, rapists and muggers the system seemed to work in their favor.Also, politicians became sensitive to the minority communities complaints of police strong armed tactics leaned on local police forces to ease off. All this coincided with an explosion of violent crime in the early 1970's where the public particularly in the big cities became anxious and frustrated at this. Therefore movies such as DIRTY HARRY where Harry used his own methods to get his man and DEATH WISH which encouraged the public to fight back using the same methods as the hoods all captured the public imagination. In the follow up, MAGNUM FORCE explored the possibility of vigilante cops acting as judge, jury and executioner because the system seemed not to be working.Inspector Callahan is not impressed by these new methods and shrugs off pressure from above. The beginning of the movie sets the tone, from his indifference towards the gunned down thugs as well as the way he tackled the hijacked plane only demonstrated the way he wanted to do his job. When it appears that some one is trying to put the courts out of business as the body bags that are piling up in the cities morgue are San Francisco's dregs of the earth, Callahan has the unenviable task of finding out who is responsible for this? Harry at first thinks that it is some rouge cop acting out of impulse who might be the one responsible for these revenge killings but as things progress it appears that this is not just a random or a spur of the moment act.Callahan becomes suspicious towards a well disciplined team of rookie cops who he knows are expert marksman. It appears that they are a highly motivated and are a product of a well organized shadow police force who have support much higher up the chain of command. Although Callahan has no empathy towards the people who are being killed and to a large extent understands why somebody might carry out such a deed, he is much happier catching them in the act and blowing them away in a shoot out. He is uneasy at the blatant execution style of these killings and is way beyond what he thinks is right! As his investigation unfolds, he too becomes a target and when his partner gets rubbed out it seems that he may have crossed more than just the mayor and the chief of police! Now with nobody watching his back, can he get to the bottom of this before he becomes a victim, and more importantly who can he trust?There are obvious plot holes but it is more than compensated by great cinema photography with great shots of San Francisco, shoot outs, an easy going back ground score and and of course a very smooth Clint Eastwood to boot. The sparing between Briggs and Callahan is entertaining and produces some great dialog, it's well worth a watch and I'd highly recommend this to 70's movie buffs and Clint Eastwood fans!.",Magnum Force

140,paul_johnr,"Eastwood, Holbrook save day in trashy follow-up",5,3 September 2008,"'Dirty Harry' was a two-pronged success for Clint Eastwood, as the 1971 thriller broke new ground in police films and earned over $28 million at the box office. With this good fortune, however, came backlash from writers such as Pauline Kael and Roger Ebert who judged the movie as 'fascist' and an endorsement of police brutality. The first Dirty Harry sequel, 1973's 'Magnum Force,' was a direct response to these claims and hoped to build on Harry's already-solid marketing power.'Magnum Force' opens at City Hall in San Francisco, where mobster Carmine Ricca (Richard Devon) has been acquitted of killing a union leader and his entire family. Ricca is free on a technicality and drawing protests from those already sick of loopholes in the American justice system. When returning home from the trial, Ricca and his legal team are pulled over by a sunglass-wearing motorcycle cop who shoots dead all four men.San Francisco's felons are dying in mysterious hits and the police have almost no clues. Inspector Harry Callahan (Eastwood), who has been transferred from the homicide division and worked recent months on stakeout, is ordered to investigate. The assignment comes unwillingly from Lieutenant Briggs (Hal Holbrook), a by-the-book administrator who is disgusted with Callahan's tactics. Callahan soon realizes that four motorcycle cops (David Soul, Tim Matheson, Kip Niven, and Robert Urich) are members of a sub-organization called Magnum Force that aims to wipe out crime in San Francisco, regardless of the cost to human life. Harry, who is seen as a prototype by Magnum Force, refuses to support it; he believes that any such group would endanger honest citizens rather than protect them.One can't expect 'Magnum Force' to rival its predecessor, but this follow-up is still a major disappointment. The writing, direction, and technical work of 'Magnum Force' simply don't compare to Don Siegel's original film. Magnum Force's screenplay (by John Milius and Michael Cimino) does not have the tight plotting or razor-sharp dialogue that makes 'Dirty Harry' special. The plot is littered with conveniences such as Callahan eating at an airport snack bar when a hijacking occurs and Harry not being able to start a motorbike, which allows David Soul to catch up with him and engage in a chase. Also featured are an unnecessary love interest (played by Adele Yoshioka) and one-dimensional characters who only exist to be tortured and knocked off (including Margaret Avery as a prostitute who swallows drain cleaner). 'Magnum Force' doesn't build on its premise, yet drifts on crude tangents and is much longer (124 minutes) than it needs to be.Don Siegel was replaced by Ted Post as director, whose experience is mainly in television. Post's direction is bland and without a clearly defined style; he frequently uses master shots rather than close-ups of actors and vehicles, which ruins the sinister, closed-in atmosphere that Magnum Force's death squad is supposed to generate. The action scenes are very basic in approach when their energy could have been heightened by some imaginative camera work. These sequences have a degree of excitement, but they rarely walk the levels of 'Dirty Harry,' whose action is quite limited. The cinematography by Frank Stanley is also a major jump down from that of Bruce Surtees in 'Dirty Harry.' 'Magnum Force' has a dreary appearance on lower-quality film stock; combined with the violence and trashy situations, 'Magnum Force' has an atmosphere similar to 'B' films by American International Pictures and Crown International. It's almost hard to believe that 'Magnum Force' was released by Warner Brothers and that Eastwood fills the starring role.Strong performances by Eastwood and Holbrook keep 'Magnum Force' from being a complete disaster. The two veterans play their roles intensely and make the film considerably more entertaining than its script allows for. Supporting roles with Soul, Matheson, Niven, and Urich are effectively played, although their lack of identity in the biker squad makes this whole greater than the sum of its parts. Actors from 'Dirty Harry' such as Albert Popwell and John Mitchum reappear; Felton Perry has a dull turn as Harry's ill-fated partner. Lalo Schifrin is back as composer, which gives the series a further degree of continuity. The brilliant theme song combines his sleek orchestration and wordless vocals. Interestingly, Schifrin's music during the film is mostly background color rather than holding a dominant place.Warner Brothers has released a snapper case version of its 'Magnum Force' DVD, improving the flimsy cardboard version previously sold. The DVD treats 'Magnum Force' with respect, but is weak on extras. 'Force' is presented in widescreen with Dolby 5.1 stereo enhancement; dubbing and subtitles are offered in five languages. Magnum Force's print is in fairly good condition, although grain is visible and colors look faded. Audio presentation is decent; while Schifrin's score comes across nicely, dialogue is sometimes muffled.DVD extras include a commentary track with screenwriter John Milius; 'A Moral Right,' WB's 24-minute program on the social implications of Dirty Harry; 'The Hero Cop,' a short program released during Magnum Force's production; and a gallery with all five trailers from the Dirty Harry series. As a person who doesn't especially like John Milius's work, I found his self-righteous commentary grating. To worsen matters, the new program is only a rehash of ideas from Warner's 'Dirty Harry' DVD; I would've rather seen a 'making of' program that examines 'Magnum Force' in depth. On the plus side, its trailer gallery is an excellent look at Dirty Harry's evolution from 1971 into the 1980s. Harry fans will certainly be entertained (as I was), but the film and DVD never live up to their potential.** ½ out of 4Roving Reviewer - www.geocities.com/paul_johnr",Magnum Force
141,les6969,Brilliant Sequel,10,18 May 2010,"Sequels are not always good and often a let down, but this is not the case with this film. It is hard to add anything new considering the many excellent reviews on here already. I recently caught this on TV and had forgotten what a great film it was. It sure keeps your attention throughout and has a bit of everything to please any Clint fan. Clint Eastwood is really at his very best in this and the supporting cast are all excellent also. Of course it has the added interest of having a number of young actors who went on to find fame later on, but it is really the fact that is has such a great story that this is one of the best in the Dirty Harry series.",Magnum Force
142,kittiwake-1,Ho Hum,5,15 January 2007,"*yawn* Oh, excuse me, I forgot where I was for a moment. This movie is a favorite of many Clint Eastwood/Dirty Harry fans. After growing up watching mystery whodunnits, suspense thrillers, and unexpected twists in the plot, this was very disappointing. If you love Eastwood, more power to you. If you don't care either way about Eastwood, then don't feel guilty if you never view this one. I solved the mystery of ""whodunnit"" in the first 15 minutes or so, and spent the rest of the movie tabulating all the easy-to-spot ""clues"" that were written into the plot. If you haven't figured it out by the end of the movie yourself, check your pulse. You may be stone cold dead. Maybe this was good for its time. I didn't think so. Watch out for nudity. If you don't want to see it, don't watch this movie. I found the revealing shots gratuitous. Save yourself the boredom and find something else to watch.

143,scrapmetal7,Magnum Force: IMO the best Dirty Harry movie.,9,14 November 2006,"SFPD Detective ""Dirty Harry"" Callahan finds himself in the middle of a conspiracy to change the face of police work from standard procedure to vigilante justice when he's faced with a string of murders committed by a secret cadre of assassins in the uniformed police.Magnum Force is my favorite of the Dirty Harry movies. Harry Callahan finds himself up against a problem, and a concept, that is bigger than his ability to easily deal with practically or intellectually. Rather than facing some vile criminal for whom he feels only disgust and contempt, his antagonists in MAGNUM FORCE are people whom he knows and likes, and with whom ehe even feels he has a lot in common. It's like he has to fight a more extreme version of himself. Also, unlike other Dirty Harry films, in MF he must use his investigative skills as well as his instincts to piece the situation together.Magnum Force is the most artful of the Dirty Harry films. Kudos to Ted Post! Rather than build the whole film around Clint Eastwood and Harry Callahan, he focuses on the story and direction and wisely lets Eastwood handle himself. The result is a city-wide crime scene through which Callahan must negotiate his way and pick up the pieces.The plot is sequenced very well and each scene is well filmed. The story features great, effective set pieces, such as the airplane hijacker scene, the grenade attack on the pool, and the pistol range contest. Ted Post makes good use of the San Franscisco back-drop, as well as having a lot of fun with the visual of a uniformed patrolman as both an object of terror as well as one of hope. A scene where Callahan is confronted in a parking garage by the renegade squad is chilling.Sole complaint: Hal Holbrook's constant raspy ""CALLAHAN!"" snarl, repeated ad nauseum.",Magnum Force
144,thebigeasy555,The Ultimate Dirty Harry,10,17 August 2006,"The second and the best of the Dirty Harry series Career criminals,gangsters,pimps and other undesirable elements are being wiped out.You would think everyone would be happy especially Harry but there's something sinister going on...A special death squad inside the SFPD led by Lt.Briggs are slaying the scum of society ruthlessly and without remorse.Armed with their colt pythons and wearing their motorbike uniforms many deaths are executed(consisting of a young David Soul) Many critics of this film state the excessive violence is unnecessary.I feel this is not justified as the death squad's anger at the justice's system lack of ability to deal with criminals needs to be accentuated.This is manifested in the following scenes, The killing of Polancio and his entourage.The murder of the pimp.The massacre at the pool.Their ferocious aggression surpasses even Harry's and is an integral part of the film.Harry needs to use his mind more to trap the killers instead of his usual unconventional methods.A cunning trick at the shooting contest gives him the evidence he needs to confirm his suspicions though he had no idea Lt.Briggs was directing the death squad.The music used from start to finish sets the tone and creates an atmosphere which is required for the film.The opening credits where Harry is seen holding his .44 magnum against a red background with the seventies music is awe inspiring.The ending sequence where Harry mutters ""A man's got to have limitations""is an iconic moment of movie history.A fantastic achievement for everyone involved and cemented Clint Eastwood's place in stardom.Encompassing everything needed in a cop film the sheer quality sets it apart from all competitors",Magnum Force
145,rtrnt,"Not as gripping as Dirty Harry, but strong enough on it own",7,27 April 2020,"The first sequel ""Dirty Harry"" isn't as menacing or viscerally tough as the original, which is a daunting, almost impossible standard to meet. The good news is, this still works as a action-crime drama in which the maverick detective who routinely breaks the rules to get the job done suddenly finds himself at odds with his own police department under circumstances he didn't see coming.Clint Eastwood is as effective here as in any film, even the script doesn't always give him something meaty to work with. Hal Holbrook is a solid presence as Harry's superior. Felton Perry makes a great Eastwood partner in this installment. My only real grumble with this film is it's deliberate pace and lack of build-up to the finale, which is welcome when it happens. The action can be quite violent but it's nothing you haven't seen in any other Dirty Harry film. And as usual, it's a script that knows how to put a signature at the end. Recommended to Eastwood fans and those looking for a good action flick.",Magnum Force

Here, someone is out there killing all the city's dirtiest criminals. Soon enough Inspector Harry Callahan is on the case with his new partner Early Smith (Felton Perry).Really gets a strong 7 out of 10 from me and has some great memorable scenes like the original, but it does bring some problems. Like the film does seem to go on for a little long after the biggest surprise is revealed. So the film may work better as a deeper look into Harry Callahan and his further thoughts on justice or injustice than it being looked at as a mystery which it pushes itself as. For there are way too few possible suspects especially when you watch the killer and his face.Like the original a spectacular score from Lalo Shifrin and really some pretty good actors in supporting roles such as Hal Halbrook as Harry' boss Lt. Briggs and four new cops to the force in David Soul as Davis, Tim Matheson as Sweet, Kip Niven as Astrachan and the late Robert Urich as Grimes.

147,TheFilmConnoisseur,Eastwood Force (May contain Spoilers),10,19 June 2003,"****Excellent***Good**Fair*PoorIn my opinion I consider Magnum Force to be the best film in the series. Here what I personally find unique about this film is the quote ""Man's Got to have his limitations!"" In the original, Dirty Harry was an exceptional homicide detective who used violence and broke the rules to get the criminal.Here we have an organization within the police force itself which has enlisted a group of rookie cops to murder every single person who breaks the law. And even asked Harry himself to join. His refusal is what makes this a unique action film. In this film we fully understand Dirty Harry and his philosophy that brutality and punishment is the way to capture and treat a criminal BUT killing a criminal is always the last option not the first.
RATING: 4 STARS",Magnum Force
148,Roman11,Don't we wish???,10,5 June 2003,Dynamite entertainment with super performances by all. Special mention for David Soul and Felton Perry.This could be a VERY REAL situation as was mentioned in the film. A squad that carries out justice when lying lawyers and jaded judges put the cuffs on the police instead of the criminals. A serious movement is developing in this country for justice and retribution instead of insane and illogical pity for these animals The only disappointing aspect of the film is the ending when Harry should have joined with Briggs and the boys. What a sequel that would have made!!,Magnum Force
149,gevalero,A shame,7,12 June 2008,"It's hard to understand how with this supporting cast, screenwriter and Clint in his prime the Dirty Harry series could take such a step backwards. Perhaps it has to do with the violence which is too repelling; the action sequences silly and badly choreographed; the sex scenes gratuitous and pointless. At the end of this movie I was just tired of it. In many parts I felt I was just watching an old police show. Funny how such a mediocre movie could launch this many fine careers but it did. And a few questions: what was the point of the shoot-out at the store ? Are we supposed to believe Harry drives to the San Francisco airport on a regular basis just because he likes the hot-dogs there ? Do airplane stewardess really keep on tending to passengers during a hijack ? The one thing I came to appreciate with Magnum Force was just what Don Sieguel did for the Dirty Harry phenomenon. Sad to say but Ted Post ruined two #2 series entries: this and the Planet of the Apes as well.",Magnum Force
150,mab8485,The 3rd best of the Dirty Harry series,7,20 September 2003,"Watchable film with plenty of action and a good plot about renegade cops who take the law into their own hands when they become frustrated with the justice system. Although one sympathises with the ""bad"" guys they eventually go too far in meting out their form of justice and Harry has to stop them. Not as good as the original Dirty Harry or Sudden Impact - probably because the bad guys in those two movies are  well acted and portrayed as extremely vile and detestable characters whereas here they are just misguided.

Good overall performances help the movie, but the movie lacks a villain at least equal to unappeal as the first movie.

152,tomasg-69814,The Power Of The Magnum Force.,8,21 November 2015,"This was Mr. Eastwood's second appearance as Harry Callahan, and - among the first - his best. You can watch it from time to time and always appreciate the good work from the director. (Who was mostly Clint himself I've read; T.Post credited, though.) The story was picked up after reports about Brazilian police-squads who worked outside the law frames, and swept away criminals without court trails and like processes. Yes, it's kind of old now in 2015, but a beauty as it fits 70's movies. Cliché's, wonderful automobiles and clothes. Wawy hairstyles, not to forget. Future Starsky & Hutch star David Soul is formidable as a biker cop; in my opinion he never topped it in S & H a few years later. Many ""Harry-fans"" may think I'm crazy who rate this in front of The Enforcer and Sudden Impact ( and the final whistle: Dead Pool. ), but I will keep my rankings that way. Many cool scenes and a gorgeous final makes it equal with Dirty Harry, and a little better than the other three. It would be fun to see Clint in one last elbow leather-patched jacket, playing the coolest cop ever before he turns in, but I think no one (including Mr. Eastwood) bothers at all. But you can always imagine him as retired, keeping up the skill with the .44 on a shooting range, impressing some aspirants on the San Fransisco Police Academy! : )",Magnum Force

When a girl living in the same apartment building asks Harry how to get in bed with him, Harry replies, ""Try knocking on the door"".  There's definitely a whole load of one-liners like these this time around.  But, heck, it's lines like these that make these kind of Eastwood movies worth watching.In 'Magnum Force', Harry is assigned to investigate a group of vigilante killers within the police force.  'Magnum Force' definitely lacks the darkness and grittyness of its predecessor, but it still provides plenty of action and thrills to keep us watching.Rating: (7/10)",Magnum Force

However, the movie's plot throws in an unneeded twist involving a gangster, while simply baiting the audience with the big theme.

160,parachute-4,Mainstream 1970's Eastwood,7,22 October 2006,"We were viewing this film for the first time and the scene came up where Clint deals with an attempted air hijack. My brother made the comment ""I don't think this film is meant to be taken seriously"". He (my brother) compared both the plot and production values unfavorably with the more intense and grittier ""Dirty Harry"". That may be the case, but personally ""Magnum Force"" is one of my favorites in the Eastwood opus along with ""Hang em High"", also directed by the redoubtable, but much-maligned Ted Post. Like ""Hang em High"", ""Magnum Force"" has improved with age and one has to admit that Ted Post really wasn't such a bad director.Clint performs the usual Eastwood stuff in fine style, and one-liners like "" A good man always knows his limitations"" have become legendary. However, Hal Holbrook in his excellent performance as ""Briggs"" has what in my opinion is a line to die for; "" You're about to become extinct !"", he snarls at Eastwood, when he very briefly has the drop on him. You just KNOW that Briggs is soon going to get what's coming to him in a big way. Anybody could have told him that pulling a heater on Dirty Harry is one really dumb move. Callahan demonstrates that he is more than capable of driving a car and punching out his boss at the same time!A useful, but not memorable performance from David Soul, and good back-up from a competent support cast. In style and format, this film anticipates a lot of Eastwood's own work as a director, and he once even admitted that he learned a few things from working with Post. The ""honest cop as outsider"" character is a perennial favorite with audiences and Eastwood has made good mileage out of the Callahan role over the years. I liked the Lalo Shifrin score and the classic opening credit sequence; it lets you know in advance not to go looking for too many deep insights in what is to follow. Overall, a reasonable production in the crash autos/shoot assholes genre and like ""Dirty Harry"" and ""Bullitt"", its now a real West Coast period piece. Younger audiences really dig the seventies clothes, ""old automobiles"", and traditional car-chase sequences, especially the motorcycle showdown on the derelict carrier......

Magnum force is a worthy successor to Dirty Harry and we get to see the other side of the coin of Harry's personality. He now has a black partner and a Chinese girlfriend. Which would arguably diminish Callahan's bigotted approach as seen in the first film. But this doesn't quite ring true, as this film shows Harry is on the side of the law, even if the system is messed up. Perhaps this more mellow Callahan came about after rejoining the department, which isn't explained (he through his badge at the end of 'Dirty Harry'. It's also nice to hear him refer to his ex- partner.Storywise the film is stronger than its predecessor but it can never quite make it out of the shadows of the first venture, as the opening titles highlight. Despite this I would recommend this as a good one to watch as a double bill with 'Dirty Harry', it gives us more of an insight into what makes SFPDs finest tick and the bad guys are very good, not random psychos/ revolutionaries etc....6/10 overall, but beware the slide begins after this one with parts 3,4 & 5...you have been warned",Magnum Force
164,selfedluke,Decent sequel but lags and lacks direction,4,20 September 2020,"Standout Pros
-Really interesting plot about a secret death squad in the police department that massacres criminal gangs in SF. I just wish they didn't indiscriminately kill innocent bystanders too, it takes away from any realism or philosophical gray areas for us to think about (the corrupt cops meet Harry and lay out their motives but we're not even remotely Interested in their speech because they kill just as many innocent people.)
-Best gunshot deaths in any movie, period. Bodies spasm, nerves twitch, and the victims squeeze out labored breaths and noises before falling silent. The camera holds on most of these shots too for just the right amount of time to sell the impact of a gunfights aftermath.Cons
-Poorly directed, especially compared to Dirty Harry which imo was one of the best directed thrillers I've ever seen. Tod Post makes this seem like a long tv episode, with pointless supporting character development scenes that had nothing to do with the main plot and took away from the tension and pacing.
-Harry's personality is not allowed to shine nearly as much in Magnum compared to the original.... Eastwood isn't given much room to play around with in this as a limiting script seems to forget Harry is the main character and devotes most of his on screen time to looking sour faced and doing silently doing detective work.
-Badly shot ending scene that wasn't nearly as tense as it should have been, and a terribly unbelievable death with the final officer who falls simply 20 feet off a roof into a deep water bay, yet he somehow floats dead when Harry looks back at him.",Magnum Force

Changing the plot but not the style is good formula in movies, rather than playing out what was already done in the original, which is why so many sequels fail. ""Magnum Force"" is my second favorite film by Eastwood after ""High Plains Drifter"". Harry still likes to do things his way although rather than focusing his energy on the bad guys, he's focused on some crooked cops in his own department! Follows in the original's footsteps with lots of great views of San Francisco (My Birthplace!) I always feel at home when watching this movie. This is another film that is played a lot on TV because its so good on it's own. Felton Perry does a good job as Harry's partner, comparable to Reni Santoni in the original.

169,pawtrax67,"More action than the first, but less suspense",10,11 August 2012,"First of all, this is my favorite of the series. I edge it out slightly over Dirty Harry. It is a pity but basically the series ran out of gas after this film. There is lots of action, and a very interesting story. People who thought Harry was judge, jury and executioner (A line used in the movie) see that there is a line that Harry won't cross. If there's one thing I'd like to gripe about it's the ending. I won't give anything away but it was disappointing. I'm not sure if they were looking for a more exciting ending, instead of a satisfying ending. I would have preferred Harry using a .357 Magnum (As he lost his .44) to finish the job. The cast was great, and there's still discussions on if his friend Charlie was in on the conspiracy or just been on the streets too much (A red herring?). Great motorcycles, great revolvers, action, some sexual content. (I wish I had women proposition me like that, then again it was the 70s and it is Clint Eastwood we're talking about!) An interesting story all make it a great (Maybe not perfect) movie. Too bad the series started going downhill in The Enforcer...",Magnum Force
170,slapborisday,"Harry & Hutch (the Best, and most underrated, D.H. flick)",10,17 January 2005,"POSSIBLE SPOILERS HEREIN: this is the best of the Dirty Harry movies, but somehow it's been branded as the worst. the bad guys are fantastic, all great actors and also, future classic cult TV (and movie) stars, including, as a group of young hotshot patrol cops, Tim Matheson (Animal House), Robert Urich (Vegas), and the ringleader played by David Soul (Starsky & Hutch). the first half of the movie we see a number of deaths, what seems to be a single rogue cop killing a bunch of notorious, and even ""famous"", villains the likes of a pimp, a mafioso, and a drug dealer. the second half is Harry on his own private mission, seeking out the people that only he believes are the ""bad guys"". there are also some great scenes filtered in throughout the story, having nothing to do with the story itself but simply showing Harry at work, one a stakeout of a hold-up about to go down, and thus Harry taking care of the robbers like only he can (BANG BANG!), and there's a classically over-the-top scene in which Harry takes down some terrorists trying to overtake an airplane by posing as a pilot. the incredible over-actor Mitch Ryan co-stars as the red herring, as it were, playing a cop who's been on the beat just a beat too long, and who's the prime suspect of all the deaths that occur in the first half of the movie. and Hal Halbrook also co-stars as the slime-ball police chief who, obviously, hates Harry's guts for being... Harry. and then there's a brief (but memorable!) cameo by Suzanne Somers (to add to the cult TV stars), this being the same year she was featured in ""American Graffiti"". Ted Post, usually a television director whose directing career has been hasty at best (he also directed the second movie of another franchise, ""Beneath the Planet of the Apes"", possibly the worst science fiction movie of all time), does a great job at the helm; as do the writers, John Milius (""Apocolypes Now"", ""Big Wednesday"") and Michael Cimino (""The Deer Hunter""). there's some great music too, a classic seventies funk groove soundtrack leading the way. so to sum it up, this movie, ""Magnum Force"", is the best Harry of all (even better than the first film, which was marred by the overacting of the Scorpio Killer played by Andrew Robinson, who makes William Shatner seem like Marlon Brando). ""Magnum Force"" works simply because it doesn't take itself too seriously. it's good action/fun and that's all it needs to be!",Magnum Force
171,dirtyharryfan,"""They are killers on the loose dressed as cops"" - my number 1 all time favorite Dirty Harry film the best 70's sequel masterpiece",10,12 January 2019,"This is my movie action movie, masterpiece of the 70's ""Magnum Force"" is the greatest action sequel of all time. My number 1 Dirty Harry film of all time. The greatest action sequel of all time I love it to death! I grew up watching this movie as a child. Is my favorite action classic masterpiece from the 70's of all time. You have a vigilante cops killing criminals that court let them go and everyone. These cops kills everyone that was on their way women's, un armed people, cops to cover their tracks. I never seen in any movie like this. Clint Eastwood's best movie he ever did, I love this movie to death. I love Insp. Harry Callahan 's line by the end of the movie: A man's GOT to know his limitations.Clint Eastwood is excellent as Dirty Harry Callahan. Ted Post directed excellent this movie. They don't make movies like this anymore. ""A man's GOT to know his limitations. "" Great one liners, no CGI or special effects. Real handguns were used, real bullets. Beautiful shots of the filming locations in San Francisco are. Everyone from the cast was awesome. I miss movies like this I really miss them. It is the greatest sequel of all time. I always did enjoy this movie more than the first Dirty Harry film. I have all 5 films on Blu-ray disc and this weekend I re watch them. Once again Magnum Force is my number 1 favorite film it always was. Great soundtrack by Lalo Schifrin again who returned for the score. He was in 4 Dirty Harry movies except The Enforcer. Lalo Schifrin's score for Magnum Force was awesome I enjoy the score.Death Wish come out next year in 1974 after these movie and in this movie there are vigilantes who cross the line and Insp. Harry Callahan is no vigilante and his not above the law. The movie is entertaining, it is a good story, very realistic acting. David Soul, Tim Matheson , Kip Niven and Robert Urich are great traffic police officers who are vigilantes and kills innocent people. Lalo Schifrin for the music score terrific and excellent music score for ""Dirty Harry"" sequel. Great shoot out on the range with .357 Magnum by four police officers. You have ""Dirty"" Harry Callahan wields his .44 Magnum, shooting it up with other police officers in the annual S.F.P.D. Revolver Competition I love that in this movie so much. Harry is dressed as a pilot and stop hijacking on a plane. He beats one guy and shoots the other one - great.David Soul is great as traffic cop and the leader of the vigilantes. Great dialogues between those cops and Dirty Harry. ""You heroes have killed a dozen people. What are you gonna do next week?"", ""Kill a dozen more."" they have these conversation and Dirty Harry answers: ""I'm afraid you've misjudged me."" and they have Dirty Harry my seem like that, but you really get the sense who Dirty Harry really is. He's walking fine line, but this guys over the line. Nice telling a story Dirty Harry against dirty cops who are breaking the law.Magnum Force is 70's classic greatest masterpiece it is my number 1 favorite action film of all time. Clint Eastwood is still in his best shape. It has ton's of action for the 70's crime action thriller. The story is interesting, I love the weapons they are used for real. You see blood squibs everything this film has. I love this film to death it is MILES way better than any Death Wish movie.",Magnum Force

173,francisdufort-75626,"For a sequel, this is awesome",8,28 June 2021,"I want to start by saying that I really liked this movie. It was exactly what I expected from a Dirty Harry movie, but without being ruined by the fact that it has to follow up the original. Honestly, this movie doesn't feel like a sequel. The movie starts right in the middle of the action of the story, and the movie never mentions the events of the first movie.What makes this movie great:
Great story
Great action
No annoying love interest subplots (the girl is not an important character)
Realism (for an action movie from the 70's)
Clint Eastwood's performance
It never feels like it's boring, there is always something interesting or important happening

174,M L,The best of the Dirty Harry movies!,8,5 December 2003,"***MIGHT CONTAIN SPOILERS*** This is by far the best of all Dirty Harry movies (the worst, in my opinion, being The Enforcer)! Great character development coupled with good action and really good performances of Hal Holbrooke and David Soul (although we doesn't really see that much of him). Eastwood is really convincing and it seems as if he's more settled in the part than in the first.",Magnum Force
175,matwsussx,My favourite Dirty Harry movie..... perhaps.,8,17 December 2005,"Reasons i love this movie? Firstly its got the set pieces you'd expect from a 70s cop film that didn't make it into DIRTY HARRY such as the sky-jacking sequence and the shoot-out in the liqour store. Then you've got another ace soundtrack which has the same funky-rock beats as the first movie. And then of course there's Eastwood himself. No matter what he goes up against its all in a days work for him whether it be stopping hi-Jack's in their tracks or going to bed with Asian girl from downstairs. The dialogue (""A mans got to know his limitations"") and wise-cracks are vintage stuff and the intriguing thing here is that its renegades from within Harry's own police dept. that are the real villains here offering an interesting counterpoint the moral issues presented in the first movie. I think the first two Dirty Harry movies are terrific and maybe this one just edges it.",Magnum Force
176,hotelfocus,Dirty Harry changes sides,4,30 December 2014,"As a sequel to Dirty Harry, the plot of Magnum Force has been brilliantly thought out and neatly planned.The character of Dirty Harry as a cop who steps out of the law to protect the law, has been magnified but drafted onto a bunch of cops who are then made the villains of the movie, with Dirty Harry playing hero against them.Clint Eastwood is smarter than he shows.This movie allowed Callaghan to be Dirty Harry and yet become a real hero. As against the 'anti-hero' that Dirty Harry was.Of course most Dirty Harry movies [ and also where Clint plays a cop with any other name ] are a city version of western movies of a bad-ass sheriff out-gunning the bad guys.Magnum Force is a little different. The focus is more on the killers, and the targets. To that extent, the focus is a little less on Clint than usual.Even the focus on Clint's character in the movie is a focus on his 'reputation' as Dirty Harry.Clint plays more a 'detective' of the killings. The airplane hijack scene and shopping mall scene seem contrived and outside of the main plot. But of course enjoyable to die-hard fans of Dirty Harry. [ In a way, the scenes highlight the 'Dirty Harry' side of Callaghan while allowing for Harry to play the 'good' cop against the 'out of law' killer-cops. ]Clint's one-liners are crisp and short, and add to enhance his character to make sense of his 'position' against the 'view' of the killer-cops.",Magnum Force
177,hurtstotalktoyou,this movie is ridiculous,3,2 February 2020,"For mostly any movie you have to suspend your common sense at least a little bit, but this film just asks too much. Meanwhile, it's just sooooo cheesy. But I guess that's better than an unrealistic film taking itself seriously. I mean, it kept my attention until the ""climax"" at which point I sort of drifted off.I give it three stars for capturing the early 70s vibe, which is of historical interest to me.",Magnum Force

179,adub-40472,"My favorite ""Dirty Harry"" film",10,2 October 2021,"Clint Eastwood reprises his role as Inspector Callahan in this brutal sequel to the original ""Dirty Harry.""The movie begins with a mob boss beating a high profile murder case. It is implied that he was able to beat the case because of some evidence just disappearing. You get the idea that he shouldn't have won but he bought his freedom. The mob boss then heads off with his henchmen to start breaking the law as soon as possible. On their way home, the men are pulled over by a motorcycle officer for the SFPD. The mob boss and henchmen are cocky. They tell the officer he is making a big mistake. The officer then proceeds to execute all the men in the car with extreme precision. This movie is not for the faint of heart. The violence is realistic and raw.This will be the beginning of a string of murders and Dirty Harry is assigned the case. The only thing is, the people being killed are all considered "" bad guys."" To give away any more details would spoil the movie if you haven't seen it.This movie is almost 50 years old yet it seems like it could have been made today. Eastwood was a pioneer and ahead of his time. The movie has a great story,brutal action, and heart. Clint Eastwood is such a good actor and is the definition of cool. If you haven't seen this then I recommend getting all five ""Dirty Harry "" movies and watching them. I gave a review for this one because it is my favorite.

In the latter, Harry Calahan is up against a psycho causing panic, while in ""Magnum Force"" Harry opposes a number of enemies: enemies he would not have expected at first. Crime is still on the rise, there is too much corruption and too few 'real' cops, like him. When he meets some young, aspiring cops he is amazed by their qualities. Great acting by Clint Eastwood who is just perfect in playing the old-fashioned Harry Callahan. There is violence, but the strange thing is you support Callahan in 'cleaning' the city. One of the best in the Dirty Harry-series.",Magnum Force

I enjoyed hearing these classic bikes throughout the movie. It's a little amusing to see Clint trying to kick start the bike on the ship since the Ambassador was electric start only. Obviously they have switched the Moto Guzzis for smaller Triumphs for the final scenes on the aircraft carrier. Overall an entertaining movie.",Magnum Force

Clint is a talented and terrific actor you can never get tired of him.Mr Ricca gets off the hook for a murder,then he gets shot up by a criminal but not just any criminal but a vigilante cop! Harry comes to the scene but has a little bit of a tiff with his new so called ""Good man boss"" Lt.Briggs who is a natural pain in the ass to Harry and calls him off the case and sends him to stakeout to keep him out of trouble. HAH! Like that's ever going to happen! No matter where Harry goes there is always action around the corner, something that is important to all action movies.ACTION ACTION ACTION & a little bit of suspense we all love it!! I'm not going to reveal anymore of it. It is up to you to figure the rest out. I liked the film because it leaves you guessing until the end you've think you know who the killer is then all of a sudden there is a dramatic twist that you don't see coming and then it hits you and because there is always action, drama and suspense. There is something for everyone and if you think that's not enough there is a little something for the ladies when Harry has a little bit of free lovin from an East Asian Women. Who asks him directly firmly and too his face!!! ""What does a girl have to do to go to bed with you""? pause..blink twice ""try knocking on the door"" Wow love it never fails to crack me up! Very poor move by Carol though and what she siad to Harry about the kids was kind of tight. Love the fights that Harry gets himself into with his boss. Hal Holbrook was very good at playing the role of Lt.Briggs. The rest of the acting was all solid but the directing of Ted Post was not very solid not as good as Don Seigel.Other than that Go watch the movie it's a good solid sequel i praise Clint Eastwood for that even though it is not as strong as Dirty Harry.Magnum Force is my favourite sequel.

187,kandv1983,"Dirty Harry May Have Been The Original, But Magnum Force Rules",10,3 June 2008,"I've been privileged to see all of the Dirty Harry Films and while the original was a classic, I'll say Magnum Force was the best of the bunch. I say this because we now see the more extreme, darker version of Dirty Harry's techniques of ridding the streets of bad guys and Harry finding himself on the ""right"" side of the law this time in order to nail the bad guys, who just happen to be his fellow officers. Of course Harry realizes it will take more than just conventional police methods to bring them down. It's almost a teacher vs. students showdown and I found it very entertaining.I also liked the softer side of Harry Calahan as he enjoys some time with a cute neighbor, who happens to be Oriental. Something I found out later on that Clint Eastwood's popularity at the time was very high among Oriental women and he knew this so he decided to have an Oriental love interest in the film.Eastwood, of course, was awesome but I thought Hal Holbrook as Dirty Harry's ball-breaking superior was stellar as well. David Soul as the ringleader of the cold blooded, clean cut rookie cops was fantastic.Magnum Force...the best of a classic quintet.",Magnum Force
