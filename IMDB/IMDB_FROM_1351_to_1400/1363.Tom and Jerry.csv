0,SnoopyStyle,90's style,5,2 March 2021,"Tom is a cat pianist new to New York City. Jerry is a mouse struggling to find a home. The two get into a fight. Jerry sneaks into a high class hotel and sets up a luxury mouse-apartment. Tom is desperate to get revenge. Meanwhile, Kayla (Chloë Grace Moretz) lies to get a job organizing a high profile wedding in the hotel.When this starts with rapping cartoon pigeons, I realized that this is going to be 90's style in today's world. It's not necessarily bad but it would be tough to be good. I like it for what it is for the first half hour. It basically runs out of steam after recovering the ring. The ring is the McGuffin. Once it's returned, the movie is supposed to end. Tom and Jerry's day out in the city is really boring. This only works for an hour at most and it falters after that. Moretz is doing her every facial expressions to play up the cartoon aspect. This focuses on her too much. I'm willing to buy into this throwback movie but it wears thin even for me.",Tom and Jerry
1,jboothmillard,Tom & Jerry,5,4 July 2021,"The cartoon cat and mouse, created by Hanna-Barbera (William Hanna and Joseph Barbera), have been entertaining us for the last 80 years, including seven Oscar winning shorts, but their first attempt at a feature length film in 1992 was terrible. There were always rumours that there would be a live-action attempt to bring back the animated duo, created by to the big screen, and eventually it happened, directed by Tim Story (Barbershop, Fantastic Four, Ride Along). Basically, in Manhattan, New York, Tom Cat dreams of becoming a pianist and plays in Central Park, under the ruse that he is blind. But his long-time rival Jerry Mouse, who is looking for a new home, shows up to spoil his busking, destroying his keyboard in a fight. Tom chases Jerry through the park, and bumps into Kayla Forrester (Chloë Grace Moretz), causing her to lose her job. Tom chases Jerry into the fancy Royal Gate Hotel, where Kayla also happens to be looking for a job. Kayla tricks an applicant for a position and steals her resume in the process, conning her way into getting hired by wealthy general manager and owner Mr. Henry Dubros (Rob Delaney). The hotel is preparing for the high-profile wedding of local celebrities Preeta Mehta (Pallavi Sharda) and her wealthy fiancé Ben (Colin Jost). Meanwhile, Jerry has settled into the walls of the hotel, while Tom tries to find his way inside, and then to try and catch. Preeta and Ben arrive, along with their pets Spike (voiced by Bobby Cannavale) and Toots. As the couple are escorted to their room, Jerry's is spotted, putting the wedding and the hotel at risk. Kayla offers to help catch Jerry but fails and eventually befriends Tom. After many failed attempts, Tom designs a big mouse trap and gets Jerry out of the hotel. While Ben is taking too much time and money to please his wife to be with a lavish wedding, Kayla learns from Preeta that her engagement ring is missing. Jerry returns and shows Kayla that he has Preeta's ring, and only agrees to give it back to she lets him stay in the hotel. Meanwhile, Tom sees a piano in the hotel lobby, and takes the opportunity to play it. At that moment, no-nonsense turned event manager Terence Mendoza (Michael Peña) returns from walking Spike, and the dog chases Tom, who in turn chases Jerry, and ensuing chase destroys the lobby. Terence is put on leave, while Kayla takes over as event manager for returning the ring stolen by Jerry. Kayla tells Tom and Jerry that, if they want to stay in the hotel, they will have to try and get along and spend the wedding day far away from the hotel, to which they agree. While Kayla takes care of the hotel and manages the wedding with the crew, Tom and Jerry bond during their trip. But when they attend and inadvertently interrupt a baseball game, they are captured and taken to a pet compound. Terence, feeling vengeful for losing his job, visits Tom and Jerry separately and lies to them that they have said mean things behind their backs, causing them to fight and break out. The wedding commences at the hotel, with large elephants dressed for the ceremony, but Tom and Jerry entering cause chaos and further damage to the hotel. After the damage they have caused, and ruining the happy day for the couple, Tom and Jerry finally decide to work together with Kayla and the hotel staff, including a reluctant Terence, to salvage the wedding. The wedding takes place in Central Park, where Ben apologises to Preeta for unnecessary expenses, trying to please her and her father Mister Mehta (Ajay Chhabra). Kayla gets a job at the hotel along with the woman whose resume she had taken, and Tom and Jerry are allowed to stay. In the end however, Tom and Jerry cannot help but revert to their old habits. Also starring Ken Jeong as Chef Jackie, Jordan Bolger as Cameron, Patsy Ferran as Joy the Bell Girl, Camilla Arfwedson as Linda Perrybottom, with the voices of Nicky Jam as Butch, Lil Rel Howery as Tom's shoulder devil and angel, Tim Story as Pigeon Announcer, and the archive voices of William Hanna, Mel Blanc, and June Foray. Moretz is game for a laugh, and the stints of Delaney, Jeong and Peña are okay, while the CGI cat and mouse, in the most recognised Fred Quimby era form, are fun to watch. It is perhaps repetitive with the antics on show, I was hoping perhaps more comic violence like the original cartoons (Tom's iconic scream is only lightly heard), and the thin celebrity wedding story is unimaginative, but certainly better than the 1993 incarnation, the kids and nostalgic adults watching will have good fun, it's a reasonable computer-animated live-action slapstick comedy. Tom and Jerry were number 14 on The 100 Greatest Kids' TV Shows, and they were number 2 on 100 Greatest Cartoons. Worth watching!",Tom and Jerry
2,paul_haakonsen,It didn't leave a lasting impression...,4,28 February 2021,"Well, this movie was sort of a swing and a miss. I mean, it is a movie with the title ""Tom and Jerry"", but it focus more on the human character Kayla (played by Chloë Grace Moretz). So it was somewhat of a disappointing affair to sit through this movie.And in all honesty, then a live action movie with animated character drawn into it just didn't work. It just was so 1990s, and it didn't sit well with my particular preference for a 2021 movie, and definitely not for a Tom and Jerry adventure. Nay, Tom and Jerry should be fully animated, as it has always been.The storyline in the movie is adequate, though it suffers from being a combination of live action and animation. It just came off as way too crappy to provide adequate entertainment for me. But at least my 11 year old son enjoyed it.This 2021 movie does have a pretty assembly of casted actors and actresses, but that hardly mattered given the premise of a cross-over live action and animated movie with Tom and Jerry. And not even Chloë Grace Moretz or Michael Peña could manage to salvage this. In fact, this movie will sort of be a blemish on their resumes.Sure, it should be said that the animation was neatly done and smooth, but it just didn't really feel right when put into a live action movie.And yeah, there were some good enough laughs here and there, but they were far in between. And they were, of course, provided by both Tom and Jerry, but not from the human cast.If you have smaller children in the household, then I am sure there will be some enjoyment here in the 2021 movie ""Tom and Jerry"", but don't sit down to watch it as an adult having grown up with the Tom and Jerry cartoons, trust me, you'll be disappointed.My rating of Tim Story's 2021 movie ""Tom and Jerry"" lands on a less than mediocre four out of ten stars.",Tom and Jerry
3,blanbrn,Entertaining and fun with a story and has the elements of the classic chase rival!,9,6 March 2021,"Always was a fan of the cat and mouse duo ""Tom and Jerry"" so for sure I watched the latest big screen movie, and must say it was really good and entertained as the way the animation mixed with live action and people characters was super great. Set in New York City the big apple the tale involves a wedding(only things get elephant like crazy!) And both the cat and mouse take up shop in the luxury loft elegant hotel and their chases entertain! Wrapped around it all is a young lady and hotel lobby worker Kayla(Chloe Grace Moretz) as all become friends and learn about the ins and outs of life! The music score and scenes are well done as it even has avid fans thinking back to memories of the old classic Hanna Barbera days. In the end things stay the same with the classic chase rivals only it's live happily ever after for others. Good tribute and entertaining movie of the classic cat and mouse duo.",Tom and Jerry
4,Edvis-1997,5,5,5 March 2021,"Well, I'm a little bit puzzled and lost. It's not bad movie. First half was really good and funny, second half lost it's unique point and just lost me as a viewer. Why I'm puzzled? This movie is called Tom and Jerry and we see them less than half of movie. Better option woul be to change this movie tittle to ""Tom and Jerry stuck in comedy"" or ""Tom and Jerry traveled into different dimension"". Now, we see real people and everything, except that, all animals are animated. In one of scenes flowers were animated also. I didn't get why and it wasn't explained. As an adult I found this film not bad but if the main audience is family with childs I think kids won't like this movie. I liked that they added scenes from Tom and Jerry TV episodes, it was very nostalgic. Film was ok, I would recommend to watch it but it still needs a lot of changes to consider as Good or classic movie.",Tom and Jerry
5,westsideschl,Bizarre Non-Story,2,3 June 2021,Animation quality was poor; an attempt to bring decades old flat almost 2-D animation into the present. Script also tried to be cool current w/ rap music & human personal issues as background. Result was a bizarre interfacing of animation & live action (actually non-action). Boring dog chases cat chases mouse interspersed w/scenes of humans in a hotel.,Tom and Jerry
6,UniqueParticle,Lots of fun!,9,14 May 2021,"Animation is so well done reminded me of Who Killed Roger Rabbit where the real world is mixed and they interact with the cartoons. Anyway I see why so many highly rated Tom and Jerry it's so lovable, heartwarming when Chloe Grace Moretz character says it's like they've been fighting years. I'm so happy there was more animation than you'd expect that's great for fans! Tim Story is very good at making feel-good films.",Tom and Jerry
7,briancham1994,Silly fun,6,1 April 2021,"This film has gotten a very polarised reception - savaged by the critics and some fans, but also praised by some other fans and the audience. I can't speak for either extreme. It clearly derives its premise and plot beats from other movies like The Smurfs and Sonic the Hedgehog (the only thing missing is James Marsden). But it still has a classic Tom and Jerry feel to it so it doesn't feel that derivative. The overarching plot, despite relegating Tom and Jerry to side characters, has some engaging characters with a clear arc punctuated with slapstick antics. My main complaint is that it feels quite disconnected and contrived as it goes along, as everyone starts making strange out-of-character decisions just to fuel the plot.",Tom and Jerry
8,cruise01,Decent entertainment but gets old during its run time,6,28 February 2021,3 out of 5 stars.Tom and Jerry is a fair animated live action family film about two classic cartoon characters Tom and Jerry. Cat and mouse going back and forth with trying to get rid of each other.Lets add the live action direction with every animal being animated instead. And a little bit of hip hop musical beats with the birds singing at the beginning of the film.The film is about Chloe Grace Moretz getting a temp job at a hotel. Hosting the biggest wedding at the hotel. Except they have a mouse problem that is stealing valuable things. They have Tom the cat trying to go after Jerry. Which leads them into a long cat and mouse battle.Decent plot. Michael Pena playing a villain who cant take sarcasm is funny. It has some humor. Chloe Grace Moretz did a decent job playing a quirky character.The slapstick humor with cat and mouse cant go on for so long before it gets old and boring.,Tom and Jerry
9,gwnightscream,Not Bad,5,5 March 2021,"This 2021 live-action-comedy stars Chloe Grace Moretz and Michael Pena based on the cartoon classic. It features a young woman, Kayla (Moretz) who gets a job at a hotel that has a mouse problem, Jerry who sneaks in to live while cat, Tom tries to catch him with Kayla's permission. Pena (Fantasy Island) plays Kayla's despicable boss, Terence and Colin Jost (SNL) & Ken Jeong (The Hangover) also appear. This isn't bad, the cast is decent and there's plenty of humor.",Tom and Jerry
10,lisafordeay,Mediocre Version Of Who Framed Roger Rabbit,3,27 February 2021,"Tom And Jerry is a 2021 fantasy comedy starring Chloe Grace Moretz(Kick Ass and Red Shoes) Ken Jeong and Colin Hurst. Directed by Tim Story(Fantastic Four)this animated/live action film focuses on a young woman named Karla who steals a resume belonging to someone who was also looking for a job at a fancy hotel as a wedding planner to a rich couple. She later meets Tom and Jerry who help her out from her sly boss(Micheal Pena).Half the time I was thinking am I watching Paula Abdul's video for Opposites Attract
mixing Hip Hop music or what. The title charcthers were pointless in this film as it focused more on Chloe Grace Moretz than Tom and Jerry. I was really disappointed with this film as I loved Tom and Jerry growing up as a kid. If you love Tom And Jerry go watch the animated series instead.",Tom and Jerry
11,DarkVulcan29,Amusing to say the least,8,1 March 2021,"It times feels like two movies at once, Tom and Jerry stepping out there comfort zone and into the real world, playing off the live action characters, like Chole Grace Moretz and Michael Pena.
A fun time for anybody is a Tom and Jerry fan, animation was good, not for everybody I mean building a movie around this is not easy, the original Tom and Jerry cartoon is just a series of shorts. so it can not be those two going at it.",Tom and Jerry
12,generationofswine,An Honest Review,1,2 March 2021,"Well, I don't want to say it's HORRIBLE... but that's about all.For a Tom and Jerry cartoon, there is very little actual Tom and Jerry and more of the focus is on the live action actors than the animated characters. And that, honestly, is my biggest complaint.All the rest of it is exactly what one would expect. Especially since Tom and Jerry doesn't lend itself to an actual feature film, at least in length. So the plot is as cliche as you would expect, the only down side is that you expect that cliched plot to focus on the titular characters.",Tom and Jerry
13,kevin_robbins,"This is just short of an all time great masterpiece, but it is way closer to that than it should be.",8,18 May 2021,"Tom and Jerry (2021) is a movie my daughter and I caught in theatres upon its release. The storyline focuses on Tom and Jerry looking for a new place to live and settling on a hotel that is about to come under ""new management,"" for better or worse. The week ""new management"" arrives the hotel happens to be hosting a celebrity wedding. What could go wrong? This movie is directed by Tim Story (Barber Shop and Fantastic Four) and stars Chloë Grace Moretz (Se7en), Michael Pena (Crash), Ken Jeong (The Hangover) and Patsy Ferran (Treasure Island). The storyline for this is as you'd expect for the genre, the real actors and writing/script assigned to them is blah, but the animation style, how it mixes with reality and the animated content is 10/10 good. I was mesmerized by the quality of this picture in a ""not as good Who Framed Rodger Rabbit"" kind of way. Just outstanding. The storyline is ridiculous and just there to enjoy the animated characters...and it works (just like the old cartoons of Tom and Jerry or Bugs Bunny, who cared about the story, just seeing the animated characters interacted is awesome). This is just short of an all time great masterpiece, but it is way closer to that than it should be. I strongly recommend seeing this and would score it a 8/10.",Tom and Jerry
14,stevendbeard,Usual High Jinks,7,27 February 2021,"I saw ""Tom and Jerry"", starring Chloe Grace Moretz-Shadow in the Cloud, The Equalizer; Michael Pena-Fantasy Island_2020, Vacation_2015; Colin Jost-SNL_tv, How To Be Single and Ken Jeong-Avengers:Endgame, Crazy Rich Asians.
This is the second Tom and Jerry theatrical release-the first was in 1992-and it's the first live action/animated version of the Hanna_Barbera created duo. This movie tells the story of how Tom and Jerry meet and became enemies. Chloe plays a struggling woman in the work force that finagles here way into a job at a prestigious hotel-she lies on the application. Michael, the head of hotel relations, mistrusts her from the start but a high profile wedding is coming to their hotel and they are short handed. Chloe has her hands full; trying to make sure things run smoothly with Tom and Jerry doing their smash and bam thing and then she has to try to make sure the wedding goes off seamlessly. Colin plays the rich groom getting married and Ken is the chef in charge of the festivities in the kitchen. There is a quick and funny cameo of another cartoon character, Droopy-look for him in the jail scene. If you are a fan of the cartoons then you should enjoy this one-I did. There are the usual high jinks and comical violence inflicted on-mostly-Tom & Jerry and if you stay until the end credits are finished, there is a bonus scene.
It's rated ""PG"" for cartoon violence, rude humor and some mild language and has a running time of 1 hour & 41 minutes.
I'm not sure if I would buy it on DVD but it would be a good family rental.",Tom and Jerry
15,JoBloTheMovieCritic,Tom and Jerry,4,2 March 2021,4/10 - I hope Chloë Grace Moretz and the rest of the cast/crew got a big payday for having their names attached to this poorly-plotted 2D animation-live action hybrid,Tom and Jerry
16,drqshadow-reviews,A Strikingly Bad Effort That Inexplicably Casts the Title Pair in Supporting Roles,2,17 March 2021,"The titular duo resumes their eighty-year rivalry in this weird mashup of low-grade live-action footage, clunky hand-drawn animation and unconvincing computer imagery. Ever-so-slightly modified from their classic forms, Tom and Jerry now occupy some curious alternate reality where all the world's animals are cartoon-based, most can talk, and the human population has learned to live with the occasional giant mallet attack.Vapid YouTube celebrities are still a thing in this parallel dimension, to our universal relief, which is where our main plot thread comes in: two such influencers are in town to tie the knot, in an appropriately extravagant fashion, and our cat-and-mouse combo tumbles into a spot on the periphery. There they remain, all but ignored for great swaths of the movie, while we instead focus on the watery tale of an out-of-depth wedding planner (Chloë Grace Moretz deserves a Razzie for this) and her long-suffering quest to appease a needy, entitled bride and groom. Man, it's as deep as a Hallmark movie.While they're around, the film's namesakes remain loyal to their roots - Jerry instigates everything and Tom overreacts - but all the sight gags feel stale, very few efforts are made to leverage the unique qualities of a big picture format and the Roger Rabbit wannabe footage just doesn't work. It also suffers badly for its lack of a sympathetic face: in the end, after everything they'd put me through, I just wanted to see everyone lose.",Tom and Jerry

18,jewelch,loved it,9,16 March 2021,"The bright, colorful ""Tom & Jerry"" brings the cartoon duo into the real world, and even if it never amounts to much more than a series of escalating hijinks, it provides a fair amount of laughs outside the antics of its namesake duo.

19,masonfisk,I GUESS A HECKLE & JECKLE FEATURE IS UP NEXT...?,2,31 March 2021,"Our favorite battling feline & rodent make it to the big screen in this recent release. Finding themselves in New York City, Tom just wants to play his keys (we see him attracting a crowd as he serenades them w/his keyboard) while Jerry is looking for a place to stay. Finding a suitable berth (at least to his standards) at a swanky hotel, Jerry moves in just as an event planner, played by Chloe Grace Moretz, has also conned her way into the position as a looming big time marriage is about to befall the establishment. Coming across the disruptive presence of Jerry, Moretz decides to employ Tom to take care of business but adding to the impeding rigmarole is the soon to be newlywed's pet dog, Spike, w/the relationship between all 3 animals a combustible accident waiting to happen. Directed by the perennial workmanlike Tim Story (who has an astounding number of hits under his belt & voices a pigeon here), nudges our celluloid pair into directions they need not be on (hip hop, really?) just to goose favor w/who? Remember Tom & Jerry have been around since the 1940's so I think the notion of reinvention in this case has fallen on death ears (& eyes for that matter) but unless you're forced by your kids to see this, string together a collection of their excellent shorts & show them that instead.

20,questl-18592,TJ Reloaded,2,6 March 2021,"When I was a kid, anytime my family got pizza I just had to pull out the old 1992 Tom and Jerry movie and put it on as we ate. Literally, every time we would order pizza out came the VHS and we were off. All that to say, I used to love Tom and Jerry so you can imagine my disappointment when I hit up HBO Max and decided to finally watch this mess.First and foremost, this animation doesn't work. Now this might just be a preferences thing and others wont be bothered by it but the Who Framed Roger Rabbit thing of doing animated animals around live actors feels weird here. The animation they use just makes it feel strange and clunky and there's not enough explanation in this universe for why any of this stuff is ok with people or why some things are reacted to one way and another way at other times. The actors interacting with the toons also feel off and forced, Moretz is there for the majority of it and I think she's better than what we're getting here but it's just remarkably clunky. Secondly, I just don't know if this whole schtick works anymore. The violent cat and mouse games don't really fit with our modern sensibilities and I feel like that's reflected as the movie tries to skirt things rather than going all out with it. It leaves this as an overall frustrating experience of halfhearted nonsense rather than a lighthearted romp.Overall, there's nothing here worth visiting. I don't think it's worth it for kids and there's definitely nothing here for adults. It's just not worth the time and about half way through I felt myself wishing for this mess to be over.",Tom and Jerry
21,masonsaul,Below average,4,27 February 2021,"Whilst not as offensively bad as something like Scoob!, Tom and Jerry is still a below average animated movie that annoyingly chooses to focus on its human characters and sideline its title characters. The slapstick comedy is average for the most part with a couple of brief funny moments. The majority of the jokes aren't funny either. The blending of the animated and live action isn't that good or impressive. However, Chloë Grace Moretz and Michael Peña both give committed performances and at least Tom and Jerry don't speak.",Tom and Jerry

REVIEW:When you get a cartoon movie, chances are you are going to get a fun film to say the least. Tom and Jerry dive back into their usual games and bring that same level of laughs and charm that I fell in love with as a kid. When they are at each other in the usual cat and mouse game, it feels a bit like the classic cartoon episodes, which roped fans like me back into the moment. And as you can expect from the trailers, the movie is also cute as well not only in terms of the animated mouse and cats, but in terms of just the story of the movie. Tom and Jerry's tale is not bad to be honest, essentially tying in three stories that sort of mix into the fancy hotel that much of the movie takes place. Moretz's character Kayla is trying to prove herself in the modern girl power way, but has enough of a twist that it's not in your face like some movies have been as she tries to prove you are more than a piece of paper. Tom and Jerry are integrated in trying to find ways to survive in the city, by making the hotel their warzone but eventually find more to their lives, and the centerpiece is a wedding involving an Internet super couple who have issues of their own. All three tales are decently mixed together in an attempt to add layers to the film and for those with young families again provides a good medium to get charmed with, while those tired of love stories mixed into everything are not going to be fans.
In regards to execution, this is where the movie does better at times for me, with the visuals and cartoon animation getting some nice touches and clean up that modern technology has made well. Acting wise, the movie is not bad, Moretz has spunk and some diversity when she is not funneled down some cheesy sitcom moments. Pena shines as well, but this was not my favorite character from him as I think the limitations of the writing with the censorship meant his character had to be a bit cartoony himself. As for Colin Jost, he stands in well for his part, but again limited given the grand scale of the movie. Past live acting performances, the Tom and jerry shenanigans do make some appearances in the film, with several bouts of the two cartoons tearing each other apart that feels somewhat like past episodes. These are the fun parts for me for this film and the true strength of the movie to people like me in how much nostalgia these moments bring. Nods to classic episodes, the same high energy anger as cat and mouse outwit each other, and all the chaos that they bring with them. In addition, you can find a few other references for those who are super fans hidden in the background or quick cameos, potentially suggesting more is coming for this franchise. Headhunters like me should really enjoy this aspect to deviate from the love story that takes center stage.And for all the good, the modernization trend still hits the movie hard for me and sort of dilutes the qualities I loved with the series as they tried something new. For one, the three plots may mix together semi homogenously, but they also are weak at the same time. Kayla's story has the most gup behind it, but it and the titular characters' tales take back seats to the main love story that has little merit given what I wanted from the movie. You should be able to see some fairly big cuts and holes to the plot, which is surprising given this movie was nearly 2 hours long. I understand it's not supposed to be a masterpiece, but given all the elements they could have chosen, this mixed approach needed some work. Acting wise I said it's fine, but there are times where again it's a stretch, due to either forced love pieces or perhaps the G-PG rating censorship that restricted the actors from bringing their full game. Again Pena's character could have been awesome, but watching the film I felt he had some pull or pressure to go differently from the route he could have taken it; something that extends to the other actors as well. This even extends to the physical acting, which as seen in the trailers, has moments where they directed the actors to extend their talents to marked spots and editing came into clean up. Moments like these were a bit cheesy and stretched in terms of editing, that could have been handled a different way to clean things up. This is definitely big for me in the sound editing, which either due to HBOMax's server/file condensing or the movie itself is very limited for me compared to things like Netflix shows.
This brings me to what I feel is the biggest limitation of it all and the subcategories that make it up, how the movie feels in terms of a Tom and Jerry themed film. While cute, this modern tale just does not feel like the adventure that we used to get during the golden age of cartoon animation. Those episodes were fun, campy moments, all about the two characters fighting each other in different venues as they battled for dominance over the topic at hand. Sure, the stories of those episodes are limited, merely settings to which cat and mouse are to wage war, but that's what worked. This film tried to up the stakes of the story, I appreciate that, but they needed to make the story a bit more grounded to the main characters where their involvement had a point with maybe one other story put in as well (which would have been Kayla's tale). In addition, while the cameos of other characters are nice, the big bad Spike is pulled in and his inclusion feels wasted to me compared to the classic moments he has been immortalize for. This is true for a lot of other characters, who showed promise of big integration and then... poof were kind of forgotten and that came out lazy to me to be honest. I don't know if these decisions were to build a universe like Scoob is trying to do, or if it was trying to incorporate a live action/shares cartoon universe, but there are some improvements needed to make future films not feel so sloppy for me. The fights themselves may have had the choreography, but something that was an interesting direction was replacing melodious melodies with rap songs, I guess to give it edge, but for me had it missing something that felt out of character.
In addition, the modern era of censorship has gotten in the way of the full potential of the chaos these guys bring in the past. Sure there were iron face smashes, some traps that were clever, and a few baseball bat hits, but that's where the limitation ends because guns, fires, and axes are now too violent for kids to watch so it lacks the full bite they used to bring. I guess the challenge of cartoon weapons dishing out realistic damage also makes an issue, which again questions why did this need to be in the real world? The live action is a cool concept, but the medium also makes it a limitation given all the new rules that come with blending the two worlds, something that Roger Rabbit knew a long time ago.The VERDICT:Tom and Jerry is still cute and this movie may provide an avenue that will allow the two to remain relevant in the new age. With cute story lines, some intertwined characters, a few laughable antics and some nostalgia to bring everyone together, these two have some potential to come storming back in. Yet, the new twists and limitations of modern era cinema are what took away from this film to me. The messy story mixing, the censorship of the fights with the odd music choices, some sloppy editing, and the live action taking hold it loses a lot of the feels the adventures once had. As such, the movie is definitely not horrible to me and has some fun entertainment aspects that are classic of the franchise. However, the overall execution of the movie in terms of feel and modernization need work if this is going to be yet another cinematic universe to unleash to the masses in hopes of bringing money to Warner Bros studios.My scores are:Animation/Adventure/Comedy: 7.0
Movie Overall: 5.5",Tom and Jerry

And that's gotta count for something.After bluffing her way into a job at a prestigious New York City hotel, a young woman named Kayla (Chloe Grace Moretz) learns that there's one tiny problem- a mouse named Jerry has recently moved in, and is causing havoc with a high-profile wedding that's scheduled in only a few days' time. And so, Kayla hatches a plan, and hires a cat named Tom to take care of the problem... and as expected, chaos ensues.Directed by Tim Story, ""Tom & Jerry"" is at its best when our titular furry duo are able to let loose and spend their time fighting in increasingly hilarious situations. There are some genuinely inspired sequences and gags, and if you grew up watching the original cartoons, you'll definitely get a kick out of their antics. I also enjoyed the way the film combines CGI and live-action, with all animals in this world being animated. It's a cute idea. Where the film falls a little flat is the human storyline. While the actors are uniformly solid, especially the likeable Moretz, it just isn't that interesting and all feels very stock. And it does drag the movie down at times.Still, as I've observed, the movie seems to be a hit with kids, and that's what's important. And I'm willing to bet there will be a decent number of adults who grew up with the original cartoons will find it mildly entertaining as well. I know it managed to get a few decent laughs out of me, and I'm not even all that nostalgic for the characters.I'm giving ""Tom & Jerry"" a very watchable 7 out of 10. I'd definitely recommend it if you're looking for something to watch for a family movie night. The kids will love it and the adults will probably get a few decent laughs too.",Tom and Jerry
24,arungeorge13,Fail! Fail! Fail! This doesn't even evoke the required nostalgia. [+34%],3,27 February 2021,"Yep, this one's a big fat bore. Tom & Jerry is a live-action attempt (to breathe new life into the titular iconic cartoon characters) that bites the dust in no time. The writing (by Kevin Costello) aims straight for the lows, not adding anything to keep the film engaging. The human characters (mostly employees at the Royal Gate Hotel), played by Chloe Grace Moretz, Michael Pena, Rob Delaney, Ken Jeong (etc.) are forced to seriously downplay themselves just so that Tom and Jerry can go about their slapsticky antics. In short, their performances (or characterizations) don't elevate the film one bit. The rules of the film's universe aren't established well, making quite a few scenes appear bizarre. Forget the fact that you won't even let out a chuckle watching Tom & Jerry in 2021; it's just a terribly made film that's looking to cash in on millennial/boomer nostalgia.P.S - If you notice Droopy, gimme five!",Tom and Jerry
25,Abdulxoxo,Not bad,6,6 May 2021,"When I first heard of a Tom and Jerry live action movie, I was I like 'okay I hope they do something good with it'. After I watching the film's trailer I was skeptical about the whole thing, not sure of it's a good idea. And now having watched the movie I still think it's not a good idea! It just didn't work. Having an animated Tom and Jerry and other characters from the original show in a real world with real people just doesn't cut it. First 10 minutes and I wanted to turn it off, but i kept on watching because Chloe Moretz is a good actress and also one of my favorites. Having animated Tom and Jerry messing around the place is just weird and It takes some really getting used to. Tom and Jerry didn't even feel like the main characters in their own movie. Most of the screentime is spent on the human characters, who were terribly written by the way. Moreover, Jerry is a unlikable. Spike the dog is unlikable and irritating. The female cat, the same cat whom Tom used to woo back in the day, just doesn't feel like her, she used to be majestic. And I just couldn't get my head around the changes they made to the cartoon characters voices especially Butch and co. It felt weird. I'm also not a fan of how they re-used gags from the original show. It just didn't fit. The overall soundtrack, grates on my ears and is annoying. And the plot or what little there is, is as predicable as it gets. The saving grace of the moving is the lead actress and the character of Tom, he was tolerable at least.Overall, A fun, simplistic adventure that brings a lot of enjoyment to the screen. Though, I didn't love it, I found it to be enjoyable enough. And as a kid's movie, this film does delivers and has some silly, slapstick gags to keep the kids entertained, their enjoyment is really what counts in this case.",Tom and Jerry

28,Prashast_Singh,"A decent action comedy, and all thanks to the iconic duo.",7,2 March 2021,"As someone who has grown up with Tom and Jerry, I couldn't be more excited to see the duo return, and in a feature-length film this time. Tom and Jerry is undoubtedly targeted at fans like me who once were kids and are now adults but still continue to enjoy the hilarious battle of the iconic duo. However, this is also a key weakness of the film, because while a lot of reused gags serve as a good throwback, many of them just feel unfunny, predictable and pretty much an excuse for not coming up with something newer.But the good part is, the film manages to redeem itself by the final act. It also has a lot of exciting action sequences, and they're one of the best things about the film. The high visual appeal is another reason I continued enjoying it without the story losing me completely. Plus, the film is pretty fast-paced due to which you won't realize when time will fly by. Chloë Grace Moretz and Michael Peña in their characters were like the mouse and cat themselves, respectively. They were fun to watch, even if at times I felt they went over the top; intentionally or unintentionally is a little hard to figure out. The music was also pretty fine. Some parts were indeed pretty funny and there were moments I couldn't help but chuckle.Tom and Jerry is indeed a treat for fans, even if not for all of them, given the film's super predictable plot and several familiar gags interspersed with, however, some cool action sequences and good visuals. But the last 15-20 minutes are indeed very impressive and made me ignore most of the flaws by then. And yes, the designs for Tom and Jerry are pretty cool, in my opinion. I won't be surprised if they chose to make another one, because I personally loved the style and mixing of live-action with animation. It's just the story they need to work better on, to be honest. Until then, you may still enjoy this family-friendly action comedy over a tub of popcorn for one time.",Tom and Jerry
29,IonicBreezeMachine,"It does a decent job of adapting the Tom and Jerry formula to feature length with decent setup for a madcap farce, but workman like direction and some confused performances ho",6,26 February 2021,"Gig worker Kayla Forrester (Chloe Grace Moretz) is struggling to obtain gainful employment, but when a chance to use someone else's impressive resume presents an opportunity to get a job with the prestigious Royal Gate Hotel Kayla gets her big chance, much to the annoyance of fastidious and uptight events manager Terrance (Michael Peña). However when a feud between light fingered mouse Jerry and struggling street performer Tom finds its way to the Royal Gate Hotel, Kayla finds a level of chaos that she's at a loss to deal with.Tom and Jerry are often considered the pinnacle of the works of William Hanna and Joseph Barbera, despite their legacy often being overshadowed by their cheaper more economical animated projects made for broadcast television (Flintsones, Jetsons, Scooby-Doo, etc.), Tom and Jerry is arguably the project that put the two on the map and gave them the necessary clout to establish themselves as a dominant force in the animation industry. The 114 shorts produced between 1940 and 1958 are still entertaining to this day, and their influence is second to none with the shorts winning seven Academy Awards. A Feature film had been in various stages of development since the 70s. Chuck Jones was one of the first to attempt the project, but script problems lead to it being abandoned, another project would've involved Chevy Chase and Dustin Hoffman playing the duo in a live-action format (but this appears to have never gotten passed the development stage. We then had the (mostly) forgotten movie from 1992 that tried to shoehorn the duo into a The Rescuers type story with underwhelming results and for the most part since that time Tom and Jerry have been mostly relegated to very middle of the road direct-to-video fare. Now we have the long gestating Tom and Jerry reboot, beginning production more in the vain of Jason Lee's Alvin and the Chipmunks or Bill Murray's Garfield before the producers wisely changed direction to a mixture of live-action and traditional animation. The end result is an admirable attempt to reintroduce the duo on a grander more theatrical scale, and while there are many individual elements that work quite well, a lack of surehandedness to the material holds it back.Par for the course for Warner Animation Group, the movie is gorgeous to look at. While the integration of live-action and animation isn't at the same level as something like Roger Rabbit, the animators create a visually interesting world where humans live alongside animated animals and create a tangible living world that welcomes the antics of Tom and Jerry. The slapstick is also appropriately chaotic, destructive, and over the top with genuine creativity given to the excruciating punishment Tom and Jerry are put through. While certain scenes of humans interacting with animals have an overly ""floaty"" feel to them (such as a scene where Kayla holds a cat named Toots) the integration of live action and animation is mostly well done and creates a visually interesting an unique world that resulted in a decent number of chuckles and some moments that made me smile for their creativity (such as Jerry's home made from pilfered items).The rest of the movie is rather mixed. The setup for the movie of having an unprepared Hotel try in vain to contain the mischief and chaos created by Tom and Jerry's war is certainly a better fit for the duo than the previous theatrical film's attempt at placing them in a plucky orphan girl story, and the hotel staff is made up of potentially great comic foils for Tom and Jerry to work off of, but the direction isn't tight enough nor the editing sharp enough to give the proper level of punch to the material. Tim Story has been directing comedies since 2002's Barbershop, and for a man who has built his career on comic or light material over two decades the man shows himself to have little understanding of what is needed to make this kind of material work. Chloe Grace Moretz is a good actress if given the proper direction, but here her reactions feel overly subdued and it doesn't play off that well against the animation. Many of the human characters in the movie feel like they have rich ground to be explored as foils for Tom and Jerry, such as Ken Jeong playing an overly intense chef who seems inspired by Anthony Bourdain or Gordon Ramsey, but like Moretz they're either not utilized enough or their reactions don't result in the correct comic punch to the material.The movie also scores itself with a soundtrack consisting of Rap, Hip-hop, and R&B tracks and these musical choices don't mesh well with the hi-jinks on display because the musical rhythm doesn't match the comic rhythm established in the animation. Scenes of really well animated chaos find themselves undercut by musical choices because the scene's attempts to establish comic energy are undercut songs with a looser flow and rhythm that just don't match.When Tom and Jerry is good, it's really good, when it falls flat, it does so with a resounding thud. The animated slapstick is well done and is competently mixed in with the live action environments, but Tim Story's very sitcom like direction with an overly relaxed pace that results in scenes of cringing rambling and hackneyed jokes about millennials and social media that give the movie a stop and go feeling that undercuts the good points. With that said I think there is just enough here to warrant a viewing as unlike the duo's first theatrical film this does feel like it was made with the duo in mind, but the delivery and direction keep it from going above ""okay""",Tom and Jerry
30,Anurag-Shetty,A perfect big screen adaptation of a beloved cartoon.,9,23 February 2021,"Tom and Jerry is a live-action & animation hybrid film, based on the classic cartoon characters of the same name, created by Hanna-Barbera. It continues with the adventures of Tom, the cat and Jerry, the mouse and their epic rivalry.Tom and Jerry is an awe-inspiring movie. The fact that they merged 2D animation and live-action visuals, is mind-blowing. Kudos to director Tim Story for remaining faithful to the source material and not disappointing the die-hard fans, unlike the recent Scoob!(2020). Tom & Jerry are hilarious & adorable as ever, & are the stars of the show, just as it should be. Their crazy hijinks are the highlight of the movie. The live-action cast definitely makes the movie more enjoyable to watch. Chloe Grace Moretz is spectacular as Kayla. Michael Pena is outstanding as Terrence. Jordan Bolger is brilliant as Cameron. Rob Delaney is superb as Mr. Dubros. Patsy Ferran is awesome as Joy the Bell Girl. Pallavi Sharda is excellent as Preeta. Colin Jost is hysterical as Ben.

33,kjproulx,A Fun Duo in a Very Mediocre Story,5,26 February 2021,"I'll preface this review first by saying that I've seen episodes of Tom & Jerry as a child, but it wasn't something I loved or watched religiously. For that reason alone, I wasn't all that excited for this film to begin with. I was curious enough because I quite enjoy when creators choose to use very cartoonish-looking animals in films. Sometimes CGI animals interacting with people doesn't mesh well, so when it's done in a style such as this, it feels more forgivable. With all of that said, even though this film is absolutely targeted at children, the jokes are still dated and there's not much for other audiences to enjoy either. It's not a terrible film, but here's why 2021's rendition of Tom & Jerry can easily be skipped.The premise here is very paint-by-numbers. Both Tom and Jerry need to leave their homes. They both end up at a hotel where they feel they can make new lives for themselves. With a new hire at the hotel in Kayla and a royal wedding about to take place in the lobby, this puts their chances of living here in jeopardy. Tasked with exterminating Jerry as a mouse is a threat to the hotel, Kayla makes it her mission to outdo herself. She hires Tom as her sidekick and chaos ensues. This premise, along with how the overall film plays out, had me rolling my eyes, but there are some redeeming qualities to it.As I said, I'm a sucker for the way this kind of animation blends with live-action elements and they definitely made that aspect enjoyable again here. On top of that, there are several moments where the classic slapstick humour is hit out of the park, but that also had me wishing the entire film had been that way. Like many other films of its kind, the story is very bogged down with the human characters when the focus clearly should have been on Tom and Jerry. Yes, there are some big highlight moments with them, but it wasn't enough, given the title of the film. As much as I would like to rip apart the human characters as well, they also have their moments.Kayla, played enjoyably by Chloe Grace Moretz, isn't given a lot to do, but her quirky performances suited the film well. As always, I have to say my favourite performance in the film came from Michael Pena. I seriously can't get enough of how well his expressions suit this type of comedy. Whether it's the way he says certain lines or simply reacts to certain scenarios, I laughed on multiple occasions when he was on-screen. The entire cast is fun to watch here, but there's really not much else to the movie overall.In the end, Tom & Jerry should have been solely about these two titular characters, but the film is bogged down by too many things to do with hotels and weddings. The storyline is just something that's easily written so that kids can enjoy the slapstick-nature of it all, which is completely fine, but it just doesn't make it stand out from every other film like this. Tim Story has been a director that has always shown potential to me, as I enjoyed his Fantastic Four films and even Barbershop, but he never seems to choose projects that will bring out those true talents. Tom & Jerry is a fun watch at times, but the overall premise just sort of deflates the fun scenes sprinkled throughout. Young kids will probably get a kick out of this film, but that's the demographic anyway, so for that reason, I guess it accomplished its goal.",Tom and Jerry
34,Movi3DO,Some Good Nostalgia but Mostly Cliche Story with Too Much Focus on the Human,5,9 March 2021,"We got Tom and Jerry playing around in a hotel and a bunch of people.What I enjoyed the most about this movie was the scenes of Tom and Jerry. I really loved that some of the jokes between them were directly from the cartoon shorts long ago that I watched and loved as a kid. Tom and Jerry was a big part of my childhood. It was on Cartoon Network and there were barely any English, so I didn't have to understand any English and still enjoyed the duo. When I caught some of the jokes, it definitely brought nostalgia to the good old kids days. The animation for Tom, Jerry, and the animals were very good, and they mixed well with the real world setting. Since the movie targeted children, I believe this major aspect would work well with the audience.Besides that, there were many problems with the movie. First of all, it was mostly not funny. This is partly because Tom and Jerry weren't in the movie as much as they should. Instead, the movie focused on the humans, and gave us a predictable, boring, and quite ridiculous story that the audiences would not care much about. The human characters besides Chloë Moretz were straightforward and boring.Also, another reason for the unfunny story was because the human jokes were pretty much bad, and cringy at time. I only gave some chuckles, but most of the time I was just unfazed at the jokes.Another major problem that could rub many in the wrong way was the story itself. The story of Chloë Moretz's character was quite alarming because at the beginning she screwed another person and use the person's resume to get the job at the hotel. Kids would probably not think too much about this, but the adults might not, as shown through the negative reviews from critics. I did notice this bizarre plot, but then I did not care much because I just wanted Tom and Jerry.Overall, a mildly enjoyable movie for family that brought some nostalgia from the original beloved cartoon. However, the story still used many common and bad elements from this type of movie. 5.5/10",Tom and Jerry

Aside from its barefaced generic treatment or the comparatively indolent human characters; I had a nice time indulging myself in an invaluable concourse of nostalgia!As a 90's kid, Tom and Jerry Cartoons have been instrumental in making my childhood livelier.
Even after couple of decades they continue to be relevant. Just goes to prove how successful this particular show has been.Taking a look at its trailer for the first time, I was both inspirited and doubtful. A part of me wanted to behold this cat & mouse duo in a live action presentation but also didn't want it to get all messed up. Just like Hollywood have a tendency to do so in most cases.Thankfully, it was miles away from being terrible. On the contrary; I quite enjoyed the bits and pieces of it!Starting off with the flamboyant visuals coupled with some neatly executed practical effects!
Look wise, it exhibits competence. Orderly sequences that might seem facile on the surface but let me assure you they are damn difficult to achieve!The Soundscore & the back-end composition indeed sound different to what we used to hear in the classic animations; however gratefully they retained some of the antiquated background effects. Which I truly appreciate!What doesn't really work though is the human counterparts and the majority of the scenes they occupy. Other than their drolly humour and comical presence on screen; they mostly failed to stand up on their own.A starcast comprising of few renowned performers such as Chloe Grace Moretz, Michael Pena.

38,mfellipecampos,Nice,6,11 July 2021,"Much has been speculated about whether or not a film about the famous animated characters is being made and what impact it would generate. The uncertainty that it would not be interesting was very great, however, right in the opening minutes of the work, this is undone.One sure idea was to leave the characters exactly the way they always were, just a touch-up to make them look more presentable on the big screen. Tom & Jerry who are the stars, that's a fact. Humans have to adapt to them, not the other way around, and that works well.The story is simple, but it's enough. Mainly for being showered with the climate of love and hate that this cat and mouse live, in addition to killing that longing for being in front of the television. It's very predictable, it's up to the spectator to sit down and enjoy, without any pretensions outside of relaxing and having fun.Tom & Jerry is pure nostalgia and fosters family warmth. Those parents who will insist on taking their children to watch and say: look, that was the cartoon I used to watch when I was your age! It will also bring the discussion about the violence exchanged between the best enemies, I say friends, which was once quite common in children's cartoons. It's for watching with the family, but don't you dare pretend to be blind and not clarify some points with the children.One thing to be aware of, this movie, for sure, will also please those children who perform surreal adventures in your home.

41,MrDHWong,Another embarrassing failure at adapting a classic cartoon to suit a modern audience,3,4 March 2021,"""Tom and Jerry 2021"" is a live-action/CGI hybrid film based on the Hanna-Barbera cartoon series of the same name. Directed by Tim Story (""Fantastic Four"", ""Ride Along"") and starring Chloe Grace Moretz, it's another embarrassing failure at adapting a classic cartoon to suit a modern audience.In New York City, a stray cat named Tom aspires to be a professional pianist, busking in Central Park for curious onlookers. Tom's dreams, however, are halted after he makes an enemy out of a sly mouse named Jerry, whom Tom chases into the luxurious Royal Gate Hotel. Meanwhile, a young woman named Kayla (Chloe Grace Moretz) takes up a job at the very same hotel and is tasked with planning a wedding for a celebrity couple on the ground level. After discovering Jerry has taken up residence in the wall and is causing chaos with the wedding arrangements, Kayla strikes a deal with Tom to help her get rid of Jerry so that things can finally run smoothly.The iconic animated duo of Tom and Jerry have rightly earned their place in not only pop culture but comedy as a whole. Their high-class antics and creative slapstick still make us laugh after several decades thanks to the timeless writing and endearing characters to support along the way. But, similar to its equally inferior 1992 venture into the big screen treatment, ""Tom & Jerry 2021"" does a terrible job at pandering to today's generation by shoehorning in as many modern trends and references as possible to stay relevant. Such examples include Tom imitating the flossing dance from Fortnite, Jerry browsing Instagram for celebrities to follow, and a pair of elephants communicating in text abbreviations like LOL and OMG. Not only is this not the slightest bit funny, but it dates the film before it was even released. As I mentioned earlier, one of the best things about Tom and Jerry is how timeless it is, so seeing this type of modern humour awkwardly placed in there to make that crowd want to watch it alienates any older fans who may wish to see it as well. Not once did this film get a laugh out of me, and that's coming from someone who grew up watching the pair religiously on TV as a child. I am fully aware this film is intended for today's children but that shouldn't be an excuse to not put in any effort writing a film based around a cat and mouse duo who have delighted people of all generations for over eighty years.Tim Story, who doesn't exactly have a great track record when it comes to adaptations (see the first two Fantastic Four movies), focuses way too much on the humans rather than the titular pair. Although the film is very clearly called ""Tom & Jerry"", the duo are only on screen for about one third of the movie, with most emphasis placed on human characters we don't really care much about. Even the scenes where they are the centre of attention aren't too great, with their antics either being lazily rehashed from older Tom & Jerry shorts or the aforementioned modern day jokes that only the most simple minded of children would laugh at. Additionally, it was a poor decision to blend this film with live-action and CGI, as the zany shenanigans of this cat and mouse team look weirdly out of place in the real world. To combat this, every other animal (including dinosaur bones in a museum) is in a cartoon style and while the animation looks decent enough, it is a far cry from the likes of better films like ""Who Framed Roger Rabbit"".Out of all the human actors in the film, Chloe Grace Moretz was the only one I somewhat cared about. Moretz does the best job she can with the awful material given to her, bringing some much needed sass and playfulness to her character, but she never feels as though she was the correct person to play this role. Her interactions with Tom and Jerry felt stiff and unnatural, as though she was talking to something that wasn't there, only for it to be added later on in post production. As for the eponymous cat and mouse, I will give the writers credit for keeping them mute throughout the movie, save for a scene where Tom sings in T-Pain's voice (yes, that seriously happens), but when every other animal speaks except for them it looks weird as a result. Compared to how much worse it was in the 1992 film where they talked frequently, I guess this is a reasonable trade-off.As I said in my review for ""SCOOB"", it's inevitable that various other Hanna-Barbera cartoons will be remade for the current generation. Unfortunately, in the process of this modernisation, it loses sight of what made it so special in the first place. Never have I seen a film more desperate to cater to the current demographic than this garbage masquerading as a Tom & Jerry picture. Normally, I'd say sit back and let the kids enjoy it for what it is but I believe they deserve better and so do you.I rate it 3/10",Tom and Jerry
42,cardsrock,Wowzers,4,6 March 2021,"This is much worse than it should have been. The decision to focus on annoying human characters and push Tom & Jerry into side characters in their own movie is baffling. The humans are dumb and uninteresting. Tom & Jerry's hijinks are fairly entertaining, there just isn't much of it. WB seems to have this issue because the same thing happened with the Scooby gang in their own movie Scoob! last year. I wouldn't recommend this film unless you really need to entertain some small, easily amused children.",Tom and Jerry
43,elicopperman,Blue Cat Blues Yet Again,4,28 February 2021,"Tom & Jerry have been labeled as one of the most celebrated cartoon comedy duos for decades, ever since their acclaimed theatrical shorts of the 1940s and 50s. However, their ventures into feature films have mostly been less than satisfactory, including their infamous 1992 disaster. Now, in 2021, Warner Bros decided to make another attempt at bringing the famed cat & mouse enemies, but in a half live-action half CG animated retelling set in New York City. Despite being met with a rather polarized reception, and not performing well so far financially, it's best we take a look at the movie on its own merits.The movie centers around Jerry ending up in New York City's finest hotel around the time a massive wedding is about to happen, forcing a desperate event planner to hire Tom to get rid of the little mouse. However, their wacky chases soon threaten the state of her career, the wedding, and possibly the hotel itself. Now with a premise like that, there could be potential for a hilarious Tom & Jerry style comedy, and to the movie's credit, it does have the slapstick elements in the right place. Whenever the movie focuses on Tom & Jerry chasing each other around, the comedy is usually at its best and most briskly paced. In addition, the animation on the duo is surprisingly well done for what they're going for. In a day and age where animated movies made in computers are trying to emulate the style of classic cartoons, this movie might be one of the better attempts in recent years of recreating the look and feel of hand-drawn animated characters in a different environment. Needless to say, a lot of hard work and effort went into this movie, so there's no denying how much care was put into the visuals overall.Unfortunately, the same can't be said for nearly every other factor regarding the movie, especially regarding its greatest sin. Instead of focusing on the titular characters like it should have done all along, the movie decides to mostly tell this generically written story about a young woman named Kayla Forrester who tries to manage her job as event manager in the Royal Gate Hotel, yet Tom & Jerry come in and mess things up. Sure, Kayla herself is a charming character in her own right with a delightfully campy performance from Chloe Grace Moretz, but if she already has her own well set up narrative, then she should have had her own separate movie. It feels like someone sent in their own original script related to Kayla's struggle to find her own job, but it got mixed up within the development of a Tom & Jerry movie. Perhaps if the movie was told in a more episodic structure focusing on random escapades of Tom & Jerry throughout New York City, then it would have at least been more passable for the duo's crazy slapstick antics. I guess we can't have a Tom & Jerry movie with Tom & Jerry as the focus anymore.In terms of other criticisms, while the other actors like Michael Pena, Colin Jost, Pallavi Sharda, Rob Delaney & Ken Jeong are doing the best with the weak material, their characters range from one note to flat out annoying, and more so just move the plot along. Also, the side arc of the wedding involving Ben and Preeta is barely even touched upon outside of giving the main characters a reason to resolve the movie's whole arc. However, if there is one other major question about the movie from a technical standpoint, it's that the execution of the animation doesn't really make sense. First of all, if you're going to go to so much trouble making the CG versions of Tom & Jerry look and move like hand-drawn characters, why not just animate on paper or TVPaint in the first place? Second, seeing a bunch of cartoony animated animals interacting in this real world brings up so many questions about world-building that are never explained. I understand suspension of disbelief, but when there's no proper explanation behind how the real world functions with cartoon animals, it makes the whole movie fall apart.In fact, the more one thinks about the Tom & Jerry movie of this year, the more it begins to hurt their brain. Despite the best efforts from the cast and crew behind the movie, not even the most talented artists can save this embarrassing train wreck of a motion picture. However, if you are in the fix of some new Tom & Jerry material that's actually worth checking out, check out the new special T&J shorts on HBO Max. Not only are they way more funny and entertaining on their own, but they do more service to introducing the duo to a new generation than this dated dreck.",Tom and Jerry

Nostalgia would be watching some of the old classics this movie is no where near that.I love the old original cartoons they just het it right the 'rap music' though the movie is lame! Not to forget the autotune seriously its awful at least back in the day talent was talent and not some computer generated noise.Personally I shall stick to the originals. if you have a chance watch the original Loony Tunes,Tom and Jerry

49,backup-50362,I knew this would suck as soon as I saw the year it was made in,1,8 March 2021,"A 2021 Tom & Jerry movie? I thought ""Let me guess, a horrid reboot of something beloved that will somehow focus on a female lead who was never even a character but will be the main character now?"" Trust me, I guessed all of this, and yeah it's correct. After seeing the exact same trash redone over and over for years, you can guess it.Even if we take aside the fact that Tom & Jerry are just in this movie so it could be named after something recognizable, the animation style is horrible and the music is ridiculous. Just your typical 2020's corporate understanding of ""hip style music"" that you hear in every kids movie, not matching anything on the screen, ever. Bizarre. Aside from the producers of the Sonic movie, nobody else has ever shown enough self-awareness to change it.Basically, it's not a good movie for kids new to Tom & Jerry and definitely not good for people who grew up watching the cat and mouse and hold high hopes that this wouldn't suck. It's a bland, generic 2020's reboot like all the others. Follows the same formula and is cringy in the same ways. Enough said.",Tom and Jerry

I watched this movie only because these characters give me nostalgic feeling.To be honest, this movie was little bit disappointing to me. The story and screenplay was too weak. The presence of tom and jerry can also not prevent this bad story and it's bad execution. There were just some scenes which they used from cartoon shorts, which were fun to watch otherwise everything went wrong for this movie.Some people will say that this movie is for children so we need not to strictly review this movie. But even after being movie for young ones, story and execution needs to be good. Nothing went right for this movie. It only passed in giving nostalgic feeling to those who watched this cartoon when they were young.Overall, this movie is just for silly entertainment.

I like the way Tom, Jerry, Spike and the rest of the cartoon characters are mixed with the humans. It really had some excellent scenes such as Tom catching a home run ball at Yankee Stadium. I am a die hard Yankee fan so I appreciate that ( although the opponent' benefited from it). Is it perfect? No the wedding theme was unnecessary although the Indian woman Pallavi Shardi ( Preeta) is pretty and the cartoon Indian elephants were well done. I also think Chloe Grace Moretz ( Kayla) worked well with Tom and Jerry, but strangely not well with the other humans.in the movie. I can tell you that in an era where dreadful movies like Harley Quinn, Joker and Paradise Hills have become the norm instead of the exception, it is nice to see a new movie I can enjoy. For this I give it 8:10 stars.",Tom and Jerry

58,Brooklynsmagicmike,Eh it was ok.,5,18 July 2021,"I'll be the first to say I wasn't the biggest fan of Tom & Jerry growing up and would only watch it if there wasn't anything else on. So maybe that skewed my opinion a little bit here. But I went out for a date night with a girl to see it because she really wanted to see it and upon conclusion. We both felt that it was ok.First the movie is a bit draggy in my opinion. For an 1 hour 40 min movie it felt like it was over 2 hours. Secondly the movie lacked a real comedic punch. Sure there was a couple times I cracked a laugh, but majority I was stonefaced and not even a smile. Third I thought the plot and the direction were terrible. Without giving to much away the movie mainly revolved around the girl and a wedding go on as opposed to being mainly focused on Tom and Jerry. Lastly I couldn't stand the soundtrack and excessive use of it got played out fast. This is an older show I felt they should maybe used songs to reflect that not some low grade new era hip hop.With all that said however there were some things I did like. The visuals were great for the most part. The Tom & Jerry actions were entertaining. I also did like Michael Pena in his supporting role too.Overall I wouldn't recommend or watch the movie myself. But it isn't the worst movie I've ever seen.",Tom and Jerry

Animation was quite good, and in spirit of 2 title characters :-)
Complains about too much human time ? What did they expect- 100 minutes animation ?
Story was not much original, but was OK for this type of movies. I did not like music most part, but that's not so important.Acting was good, direction too. All in all solid 7 for me. Good movie for ages 10-110, pardon 210 :-)",Tom and Jerry
60,Darkjak007,Don't you believe it,5,26 February 2021,"What is probably one of the most difficult to adapt given the fact that Tom and Jerry do not talk. Tom and Jerry is what you would expect from this growing trend of films. Looney Tunes ,Alvin and the chipmunks,the Smurfs,Garfield,Scooby Doo, Marmaduke, yogi bear,woody woodpecker. You can't just have Tom and Jerry running around chasing each other for an hour and 40 minutes that understandable so you need to have a somewhat of a plot and for plot it's a it's a basic standard plot in a hotel with a big wedding planned.which offers plenty of opportunities for the characters to cause mischief and wreck things. The biggest highlight of course of the film is Tom and Jerry themselves are both modeled perfectly look like themselves and they move in their animated style perfectly. Objects around them react organic as if they were actually there touching them. Despite how they're animated the fact of the matter is given the art style and the fact that it's set an a real Settings with real people it just comes off uncanny. When they're running around causing damage and trying to hurt each other it's entertainment however the majority of where the film suffers is in the human cast. The cast is just bare minimum dialogue performance to try to create some kind of ""humor"" amongst them. A lot of the dialogue just Cringe deliveries by Chloe Grace&Michael Peña. You don't care about any of these humans whether your a child or an adult. The music instead of generic pop songs this movie goes for generic rap songs. Overall a Tom and Jerry is a fun little film that is worth a watch if you have kids though I wouldn't recommend it to be watched on multiple occasions. The Human cast just does not offer anything to be invested in seeing it a second viewing truly the only thing to take out of this movie that's most enjoyable is Tom and Jerry.",Tom and Jerry
61,zac-04879,An Absolute Disaster,4,2 June 2021,"Tom and Jerry would be so much better without Tom and Jerry. In this pointless reboot, the pesky animal characters blend terribly with the childish disasters and dumb slapstick humour. The whole story is unrelieved, bland and completely unfunny.It all starts with the animals. In Tom and Jerry, each and every animal is animated. The animated animal characters are honestly a pretty good mix with the live-action, but it's entirely ruined by how pesky the animal characters are. Seriously, they're all such pests and only toddlers or really big Tom and Jerry fans will find them amusing.Although the animated animal characters are nicely combined with the live-action, they completely ruin the story. The story with the actual human characters is really decent but it's ruined by Tom and Jerry. The merge is totally stupid and that's what makes this family comedy a needless waste of your time. Even young kids may not stay interested and will be waiting for the slapstick scenes and entertainment between Tom and Jerry.It would probably be better for kids to watch the trailer and a few of the clips in the movie so they'll decide whether it looks worth while. But even after that, they only show the good parts in the clips and end up getting you to waste your time, money and energy on a dumb family comedy feature like Tom and Jerry.If you liked this review, check out the full review and other reviews at aussieboyreviews.",Tom and Jerry

64,darkreignn,Gives you pretty much exactly what you expect,6,31 March 2021,"Every once in a while I'll be at a loss as to what to write about when it comes to reviewing a particular film; ""Tom and Jerry"" is one of those moments. This is a movie so inoffensive, so exactly what you'd expect, that it's baffling to me that it's receiving the amount of hatred it is. Listen, if you've grown up watching Tom and Jerry cartoons at all, you know exactly what to expect here - for the majority of the film, Tom and Jerry are harassing, hitting, and fighting each other - nothing more, nothing less. Sure, there are humans in this movie, and there is a subplot that Tom and Jerry involve themselves in. But at the same time, there is hardly a sequence where the titular cat and mouse are not trying to assault one another.The gorgeous Chloë Grace Moretz joins the cast, as does the ever entertaining Michael Peña. Neither of them are astounding, but both of them are perfectly enjoyable to watch, especially given the subject matter; they both act like they're in a Saturday morning cartoon, which is appropriate. Both of them interact with Tom and Jerry in their own way, and I'll admit it is somewhat charming. Chloë takes a liking to Tom Cat, as both of them try to rid Jerry Mouse from the hotel they are inhabiting, while Peña hates both animals, employing his own antics to rid them both from the property. It's nothing particularly deep, but it does the job.Chloë plays an employee at a hotel who is attempting to ensure a perfect wedding for two wealthy hotel guests. In the process, she's thrown into the maddening world of Tom and Jerry, as is the audience. And if you're expecting to see Tom and Jerry hit each other with pots and pans, and chase one another around, you get that here. It's not laugh out loud funny, but I'd be lying if I said I wasn't somewhat amused (I was also mildly drunk while watching, which should be a requirement when putting this film on). But, if you're somehow not entertained while watching cartoon characters hurt each other, if you're a guy, you at least have eye candy in Chloë. If you're a girl? Well, let's just hope you enjoy the comedy.""Tom and Jerry"" is a serviceable film that gives you exactly what you expect. It's nothing new, but if you want to watch some slapstick antics, you could do a lot worse.",Tom and Jerry
65,pranayjalvi,Instead of Nostalgic I felt sad,3,26 February 2021,"I have to say, a a big lover of Tom and Jerry, this version with half animation and half live action disappointed me big-time. Neither there was a good plot/story, nor there was a hint of comedy that would make us laugh. Even few of the scenes between Tom & Jerry were straightaway taken from the original 60s cartoon that we grew watching.Although I wanted to feel nostalgic about this, but there was nothing in it to enjoy or have fun at. It's a big time disappointment, but then it was somewhat on the cards when the trailer arrived. Also, there was less screentime for the main characters, and instead the movie was more focused on the live characters, which kind of felt annoying to me.My Rating : 1.5/5
Advise : Instead of a movie, it would have been a better option to adapt a full animated Tom and Jerry series..",Tom and Jerry
66,jamesjustice-92,The world needs Bill & Joe back,2,27 February 2021,"I believe every single soul on earth who has watched Hanna-Barbera's Tom & Jerry shorts from 1940 to 1958 approximately a gazillion times over the course of their lifetimes (like I did) would not in the slightest like this piece of garbage. The movie is named after these heroes but they play sidekick characters to C.G. Moretz's character who is overacting a lot and it's no wonder for a movie of such calibre. Paperthin plot, unlikable characters, awful soundtrack, unoriginal and reused Tom & Jerry gags that worked well in a 7-minute cartoon but don't work here at all and overall the movie feels tired and very unfunny. The only good joke was when a fish showed a poop emoji which pretty much sums up the whole picture. I don't know what the creators were thinking while making it because I just don't see how it can be interesting to anyone older than 10 and especially if they have seen the originals. I'm afraid Tom & Jerry will never return gloriously with something new but I keep hoping.",Tom and Jerry
67,TheVictoriousV,"One of the most embarrassing, most out-of-touch films of the year",2,2 March 2021,"In reviving Tom and Jerry, the big Hollywood studios - in this case Warner Bros. - are very close to getting the idea. Instead of some drab-looking reskin where the once-exuberant characters look like random regular animals, Tom and Jerry actually look like their old selves in the new movie. Now all that's missing is that they would be left alone, or be allowed to be funny.In an ideal world, we wouldn't even have an update, now with hip music choices and vacuous references to TikTok and flossing. I don't know which average TikTok user is gonna understand the references to Young Frankenstein or 1989's Batman (which, for some reason, is indeed among the stuff that gets spoofed in this) but I guess that's for the grown-ups.More confusing is the opening, which does play like an attempt to be hip with the kiddies but uses a track by A Tribe Called Quest. At this point, I can only conclude is that this was written by a 90-year-old man whose perception of ""kids today"" goes all the way back to Gen X and ends at infants. Yet the film is still too boring for kids and too dumb for adults.Even when the comedy tries to be out-of-touch on purpose it falls flat. Michael Peña plays a hotel event manager who doesn't seem to understand what Facebook or Instagram are; the person I saw this with pointed out that, in this day and age, this man should definitely fathom online marketing. He - or the geriatric writer - also shows his true colors when interrupting a conversation between two youngsters by saying ""I hate to break up your little TED Talk"" like that's even close to what a TED Talk is. I'm not even gonna touch the two elephants who converse entirely in Internet abbreviations or the goldfish whose thought bubbles generate Apple emojis.In the movie, Tom and Jerry face each other once more when Jerry moves into a fancy hotel right as a spectacular wedding is about to take place, and so the party planner (Chloë Grace Moretz) and her boss (Peña) must hire Tom to deal with the infestation. Sadly, much of our time is spent with celebrity cameos and lame romantic-comedy archetypes (as well as Moretz, who makes for a not-very-loveable lead in how she swindles her employers with little comeuppance and ruins the life of the only person who occasionally talks sense, namely Peña).We have Colin Jost and Pallavi Sharda as the bride and groom, Ken Jeong as a nutty chef, and Rob Delaney as the pompous hotel owner. We do get Butch and Spike from the cartoons, here voiced by Nicky Jam and Bobby Cannavale. Archived audio of Tom's screams (originally performed by William Hanna) also feature, so when Tom and Jerry do get to appear, there are slight attempts at doing them justice. The attempts fail, but they're there.They do look strange without their outlines and one wishes they didn't feel as sidelined as they do here. It happens a lot when Tom and Jerry get to be in movies; first with the 1992 feature and then with their direct-to-video films, which even used pre-existing movies (e.g. Wizard of Oz) for Tom and Jerry to occasionally interact with. Here, it feels like they're interrupting one of the rejected subplots from New Year's Eve, or any other inoffensive rom-com with big weddings and phoned-in comedic performances (especially when Tom and Jerry's function in the story stops being their usual routine and they just sort of dick around in the background).But as I mentioned, it's cute that we got something like this instead of 2019's The Lion King, or even Sonic the Hedgehog, which seemed like something out of the Smurfs and Chipmunks days. Mixing 2D-animated creations with the real world, especially when you try to make the shading and interplay believable, will always have some modicum charm to it. Still, the Space Jam sequel is probably gonna be more fun and convincing than this, not to mention far less embarrassing.",Tom and Jerry

Tim Story is a hack, and should never be allowed on a movie set ever again.The camera work is awful, their director has no idea what framing is, what depth of field it is at any given time or what lens they are using, or what to focus on in any scene. The music is trash, rap garbage that shouldn't be in this movie.The plot is aimed at teenagers or thirty-somethings with no brains. Children will be bored to tears with the wedding plotline. Tom and Jerry hardly feature in this movie. The senseless violence is maddening in this movie, and becomes more disturbing when you see real world life and objects getting destroyed. I thought we stopped this kind of thing with the last Tom and Jerry Movie?Chloë Grace Moretz looks like she is melting her face slowly, year by year with cosmetic surgery. Michael Peña is wasted in this production. His scenes are so poorly edited even he can't make anything funny here. There is no comedy in this. The writing is atrocious, but somehow what is even worse is the direction and editing; there is no sense at all of comedic timing, pacing, or any other concept for setting a scene.Every scene with a human in it seems like it is the first take captured, and then put into the final cut. Everything in this movie seems amateurish and lazy. The cartoons are 3D with cell shading and then some gaudy ugly gradient lighting over everything like we are back in the 90's era of 3D animation.The interactions of the people with the animals is non existent. Two sets mushed together lazily by a teenager in a Chinese digital sweatshop probably, with no concept of film making or art.Plot wise it makes no sense that cartoons live in real work with people. This isn't 'Who Framed Roger Rabbit' or 'Detective Pukachu', where there is a plot and concept behind it.I want to know what it takes to be a writer or director for Warner Brothers. Please send me a message because I want to become one now, I guarantee I can write a better script and deliver a better production than this trash.

72,AdrenalinDragon,Tom & Jerry deserved better,4,27 February 2021,"You know, I wanted to give this new Tom & Jerry movie a chance. Yeah the jokes looked low brow and the Human Drama stuff seemed a bit rubbish in the trailers, but I was hoping if Tom and Jerry hogged the spotlight longer than them, it might have been a bit better than expected right? Well, I have some good things and bad things to say about that, but it's more negative than positive.The good things going for this film is the quality of the Animation. I was very impressed with how well Tom, Jerry, and the other animals blended in with Live-Action. There's some little nods to the cartoon and characters you will recognise if you're familiar with classic Tom and Jerry, and thank God they don't make Tom and Jerry speak in this like they did in the 1992 film. Some of the Cat and Mouse chase hijinks is fairly entertaining, but that's really all the praise I can give it unfortunately.Now for the bad stuff. When it doesn't focus on Tom and Jerry, the Human characters are kind of bad and have pretty rubbish jokes for the most part. It doesn't help the acting is wonky from them and feels like they're there just for a paycheck. Even if you go in the mindset of thinking this is aimed for kids, it's still kind of crap. There's some Hip-Hop music that plays for a good chunk of it that feels a bit out of place, and the story is very basic and you know how it's going to go. Tom and Jerry do at least play a part in the plot, but they definitely get less screen time compared to the Humans, and the film suffers greatly because of it.So in the end Tom & Jerry is just your generic, dumb kids film that's honestly not the worst thing ever, but you really wished it was smarter and focused more on the Cat and Mouse rather than the Human characters. It's a shame because I think there are sort of semi-good things going for it, but it's not enough to save it from being a poor film in the long run. That being said, I'd say this was still better than the 1992 film, so there's that I guess.3.5/10",Tom and Jerry
73,sirwillisiv,Shows little to no genuine love for the classic duo...,1,4 March 2021,"Out-of-touch filmmakers and their dated charts strike once again. Tom & Jerry is exactly how I predicted it would play out. It's another wholly misguided adaptation of classic animated works with careless direction, bland acting and... an overabundance of R&B music? W-what the? There's an exceptionally funny and talented cast involved who have worked wonders in other films - including Chloë Grace Moretz, Michael Peña, Rob Delaney and Ken Jeong - but they are all on autopilot here. I don't really blame them, though. They were clearly never given additional takes and actors can be easily led astray by poor direction.This film is a ""quirky"" wedding comedy first and it seems like that's what it was supposed to be before writers and producers felt it was needed to shoehorn in a recognizable cartoon duo and bank on the craze Sony managed to conjure up with The Smurfs. That said, I'll give the animators credit when it's due; Tom and Jerry and the other animals look very appealing in a 3D cel-shaded style and the energized cartoon antics prove to be a cute delight in certain spots, despite the trendy soundtrack that distractingly looms over it all. We don't get enough of this animated action, however. The live-action characters are the primary focus, but the half-baked performances and contrived scenario don't warrant any investment at all.So, yeah, Tom & Jerry is a half-baked, unfocused mess that shows little to no genuine love for these renown cartoon characters. It wasn't the right setting and tone. I normally think that critiquing a film for what it is instead of how I wish it was is the best course of action, but I think Tom & Jerry would've worked somewhat better if it took a page from the Muppet's book and was a road film with the cat and mouse trying to find a new home and running into other recognizable characters and a celebrity here and there. Would've still seemed like fabricated shlock, but at least there would've been more focus on the characters that are literally in the title.",Tom and Jerry

No matter how old you grow, you'd never stop enjoying the beloved Tom And Jerry and as an adult myself I couldn't be any happier with the release of this film. It's so dumb but it wouldn't be Tom & Jerry if it wasn't like that, it's a movie that you shouldn't take seriously and just enjoy its stupid fun ride. I didn't like the mix between the animation and live-action though.

The animation goes by really quickly and is always pushed aside for uninteresting human characters. Our main lead is extremely unlikable and STEALS another struggling employees job resume.

This movie is an awful adaptation of the original show. I only watched a few episodes of some original shorts, but even I know that this does those shorts dirty.Before the bad, one good thing about this film was that Tom and Jerry were well animated. They blended into their environments well, and some of their antics are enjoyable.Sadly, the main focus of the film is a woman played by Chloe Grace Moretz, who tries to get a job at the world's most successful hotel. I found the main plot to be extremely boring, and dragged out. There's little Tom and Jerry comedy to keep the film interesting.The cast is also a mixed bag for me. Chloe Grace Moretz does a good job, and so does Michael Pena.

The fact is because that film is all wrapped and entangled around these cartoon characters where as Tom and Jerry are just like side characters in Chloe Grace's movie?

There was some of that but not enough and too much down time between which just bored me. It made me want to fast forward.Instead of Tom and Jerry we got a bunch of side characters (the humans) who take up more than half the screen time managing a hotel, planning weddings, finding lost things and some out of place romance, etc. I can care less what the side characters do...

The bride to be is having some of the lamest relationship issues. Does that sound like something for kids? It's not for adults either. Tom and Jerry have some moments like in the OG cartoon that is funny, but there is some that is not at all because the music sometimes is just off.

The Director is Tim Story, well known with the Taxi and Fantastic Four, so we can see the action that is smoothy but for sure entertaining.

98,valen060,"Retains 1940s Classic Slapstick Humor, But Too Dumbed Down",6,27 February 2021,"From what I've seen, the production team really stayed as closely as possible to the quick-witted humor that made ""Tom & Jerry"" the cat and mouse duo many came to know dating back to the 1940s and 50s. To have their tomfoolery (eh?) now be used in the modern times in a live-action setting? Well, it seems to be a step up from its fully animated 1992 predecessor, which had them speaking and singing.Here in 2021, keeping them mute is better off as they don't need words when all their actions always spoke volumes. The throwbacks to their past cartoon shorts was a great tribute. It also fills me with glee Warner Bros. used some archival recordings of William Hanna and Mel Blanc to give off the screaming and yelling sounds Tom makes when in pain or in fear. What a way to honor these men who gave Tom a voice.As for the plot? There's not much there when you place familiar faces like Chloe Grace Moretz, Colin Jost, Michael Peña, and Ken Jeong getting caught in the crossfire of the duo's antics in a lavish hotel setting in New York City. Chloe's character Kayla does her best at her new job, but proves difficult with the chaos that ensues. It's just okay. I can understand from Chloe that she cited Bob Hoskins as her inspiration to interact with animated characters, much like what he did as Detective Eddie Valiant in Who Framed Roger Rabbit (a classic).Cartoon animals sharing the screen with live-action characters has been done countless times in the past, so overall, this live-action/animated film does give off an old-school charm of classic cartoon violence and slapstick humor, but it just falls short on expectations. My one nitpick is relying too much on today's trends and lifestyles. They don't need them to be funny. It's no Roger Rabbit, but definitely fun for kids. For adults who grew up watching the original cartoon shorts? You can sit this one out and stick with the originals for a good laugh.",Tom and Jerry

Also the acting is done overexaggerating what most children notice a lot already in early age. What I do need to compliment is the role of the hotel manager, really good done in acting. Story telling is so old school it could be just an old school tom and jerry script. The film is moving around love, and expectation and trust.

103,TheMysteriousReviewer,An Embarrassing Cat and Mouse Chase,4,10 March 2021,"The 2021 Tom and Jerry is probably one of the worst things to come out of Tom and Jerry. Considering this is a live action movie based on a cartoon, it's no surprise it wouldn't be any different and has resulted this to be really unpleasant. From start to finish, the story barely feels anything like Tom and Jerry. It just mainly focuses on Kaitlin getting a job at the hotel and was in charge of the wedding in order to keep it. It was already on a bad start when we gotten to that plot line which makes the movie become predictable. The most I knew what would happen later in the movie is Tom and Jerry would destroy the wedding because of their rivalry. And that's the worst scene in the movie. That and the characters are incredibly spiteful and unlikable. Allow me to explain. Kaitlin pretended to be the employee to the other person who was applying for the job and took her resume and tore off the name. It's really hard to call her one of the main characters in the movie. I mean, that and all the other actions she has done didn't seem to make her that way. I see the movie wants to go in the direction Tom and Jerry would be friends for once, but the execution in this ruins it making the heart less effective. And the comedy is not all that good. The most I can call ""comedic cringe."" The purpose with the comedy is some gross jokes and a bunch of pop culture references. Maybe there is something good about this movie like of course, the use of animation is pretty good. What the movie is going for is 2D with CGI animation. And they reference very well from the cartoons. I did say the comedy is pretty bad. But there are some that I chuckled when it comes to some moments that stay true to the cartoons. But overall, this movie is really unpleasant to sit through. Honestly, this is one of the things from Tom and Jerry you should skip. In fact, instead of watching this, I would rather watch the Tom and Jerry Special Shorts. This came out before the movie and is much like Tom and Jerry and much better. And this movie is no different than the most recent direct-to-video ones. It is a shame this is another bad example of a live action movie based on a cartoon.",Tom and Jerry

It looked like it was shot on a mobile phone. I wish, at least, they would've choosen to use 2.39:1 aspect ratio, maybe that way the total image wouldn't bother the audience this much. And the animals' imagery was terrible too. My eyes died watching the two very different imagery; animals and humans, cartoon and reality. I just couldn't take it anymore and stopped watching after 1 hour later. And for last, I need to mention that the only good thing about this movie is CHLOE GRACE MORETZ! She is phenomenal.

Cartoon film so well played (the actors and editors are doing not too badly for interactions with non-real elements) Chloë Grace Moretz carries the film well and can appeal to both children and adults, with winks eye that can talk to the older ones (Droopy to the pound) a fun movie.",Tom and Jerry
107,Nomad007,No Exceptions - Came In Lower Than None,2,27 February 2021,"I'm not sure what to thing here.Tom and Jerry wasn't never a top tier cartoon. I enjoyed them but they were also never Looney Tunes or even Scooby Doo level.Regarding the movies it's not Roger Rabbit, Space Jam, Looney Tunes: Back In Action or similar. That's not saying much in some cases and some of them aren't highly regarded on any level. But I do enjoy them all.The 2D animation looks fine but mixed with the live action but looks ""messed up"" I'm every way possible.I like Chloë? But she really feels like she just phoned it in. She's just flat, without emotion, and seems like she's acting without anyone else in the same room to interact with. Of course her last picture, Shadow In The Cloud was just a huge disappointment, even though I waited months to see it.Pre pandemic I went to theater weekly for at least one or two movies but was largely surprised this movie came mostly out of the blue. It seems like it was hastily written, shot, edited and dumped in theaters and HBO MAX (same day).Honestly I wasn't expecting anything but was happy to see a new feature film during th pandemic from a major studio like Warner Brothers, who has produced the majority of my favorite movies over my lifetime. What I got here with Tom and Jerry was just a huge disappointment.Moments into the film it was just flat, not funny, and simply not interesting. This coming from someone who grew up with them and to this day still greatly enjoys animated (or mixed animated and live action) films (and televisions).I wouldn't recommend it even for background while you're on your phone.Sadly, it's massive disappointing. Especially even form Michael Peña, who largely plays the same persona in most movies (limited range), but is very enjoyable to watch. Here even he is not the same.This likely would never have been a largely popular movie but it could have been so much better. Warner Bros and especially Warner Animation seems to be on a largely downfall lately ; look at the Scooby movie that was also put out, but before all pandemic restrictions that Tom and Jerry had to deal with.Sigh.Home Alone 2, with Rob Schneider's even though it's not animated in anyway way is far more enjoyable.",Tom and Jerry

The Tom and Jerry Comedy hour failed, because it was devoid of what made American cartoons truly entertaining, comedy and the 2021 Tom and Jerry movie is exactly the same.The Tom and Jerry movie was wrttien by braindead WB screenwriters, who have probably watched a handful of original Tom and Jerry shows and only got that the cat chases the mouse and that they sometimes pretend to be buddies and that was about it. They pickled the rest of the film with a terrible plotline and to throw sone dirt in your eyes and ears, made the opening some horrible rap.This movie, much like Scoob, should not have been made. Plain and simple.Movies like this never work because they don't hire people who care, they just hire yes men and women who think garbage line this is good and gold.",Tom and Jerry
110,MovieWarfare,"""Forget about Tom and Jerry, here is some boring human characters instead""",3,7 March 2021,"I used to watch a lot of Tom and Jerry as a kid. Tom and Jerry just hitting each other a lot were surprisingly entertaining when I was a kid. When I heard they were making a live-action movie with Tom and Jerry, I just thought in my head that they are somehow going to ruin it. The premise is ""A legendary rivalry re-emerges when Jerry moves into New York City's finest hotel on the eve of the wedding of the century, forcing the desperate event planner to hire Tom to get rid of him. As mayhem ensues, the escalating cat-and-mouse battle soon threatens to destroy her career, the wedding, and possibly the hotel itself"". So did the director, Tim Story, succeed in retaining the spirit of Tom and Jerry or completely ruin it?The thing I did enjoy about Tom and Jerry (2021) is that Tom and Jerry's antics are pretty entertaining. Tom trying to find ways to take down Jerry while Jerry outsmarts him are still funny to watch even after all these years. I also enjoyed that all the animals in this universe are animated which is an interesting idea and visually it looks all right. I don't mind the 3D look with a vintage 2D finish design of the animals including Tom and Jerry. They look great in the movie and it has a modern feel to it. The human actors are all adequate as well.Unfortunately, that's all I enjoyed the movie. Tom and Jerry are barely in the movie as they are being overshadowed by a plot involving a wedding and some human characters. It would be slightly acceptable if the human characters were good but they are all unlikeable. Kayla (Chloë Grace Moretz) is the protagonist who is introduced by lying and manipulating a person into not applying for a job in the hotel and then steals her resume. Yeah, it's clear they are trying to set an arc of redemption for her but she is the protagonist and you need them to be likeable in some way and this is not it. It also gives a terrible message to kids that they should lie their way to the top. There is also a sort of human antagonist in Terence (Michael Peña) who is the hotel's event manager and antagonistic against Kayla. He does some terrible things near the end of the movie but he still comes out with barely any repercussions for his action. There are some other supporting characters with their quirks but they are all so one-note and over the top that it's cringy.There is a story involving the wedding of Ben (Colin Jost) and Preeta (Pallavi Sharda) with Ben being too bombastic with the wedding and not listening to Preeta is uninteresting. It's so easily predictable as they hit all the cliché beats while taking the audience and kids away from what they care about, Tom and Jerry. While Tom and Jerry's humour is fun, human humour is atrociously bad. None of it lands and they keep going for this cringe humour which doesn't work. I don't remember laughing at any of the comedy with the human characters whatsoever. Additionally, there are way too many pop and rap songs in here that just doesn't fit with Tom and Jerry and it makes me wish they used the classic orchestral and trumpet style of the cartoon.Overall, the director did not succeed in making a good Tom and Jerry movie. However, there is some enjoyment to be had and if you have kids then I can see them enjoying this for 90 minutes. I just wished that the director kept the focus more around the titled characters instead of trying to fill it up with some unnecessary melodrama. Hopefully, Warner Bros. gets it next time if they ever make another Tom and Jerry movie.",Tom and Jerry

Every violence screens such like punching and kicking between Tom & Jerry has made me uncomfortable, and my head even sympathy the pain. Exaggerated fights and destructions are OK in cartoons; In real life? No.
I think the live-action ""reality"" scenes had triggered Uncanny Valley fear, humanoid objects provoked strangely familiar feelings of eeriness and revulsion.The leading character, the girl's image and voice too sweet. Her action of raising her eyebrows and staring is very contrary, doesn't seem convincible to make audiences laugh.

113,PerryAtTheMovies,"Fun for the family, but not diehard fans....",5,28 February 2021,"Initial Thoughts:
I don't quite remember the tv show of ""Tom and Jerry"", but some of the action that takes place in the movie I vaguely remember from my childhood years. Nonetheless, basing my review on the film as a standalone, and not relating to the show, I found it to be hilarious, full of fun, yet chaotic and unsure of the direction it wanted to go.At the time of writing this review. I haven't been the happiest of campers. Meaning I didn't think childhood antics would get the better of me, but they did. I laughed extremely hard for the first half of this film before it decided to get a bit more serious and dull down.And while I did find it hilarious. I thought the film itself was a bit of a mess in two aspects.First, I found the storyline(s) to be a bit chaotic. There's three main storylines that I felt were going on. Number one is obviously Tom and Jerry fighting each other for the fun of it, number two is Kayla (Chloe Grace Moretz) trying to weasel her way into a job, and number three is the giant wedding attempting to be planned. All three of these are each trying to impose its storyline at the same time and while they do cross at one point or another they just don't bode well in my opinion. Because they have the flow that I expected. I found that character development suffered such as we don't see the conflicts that are actually affecting the bride and groom.Second, the animation was good and blended well into the environment visually, but any interaction between real world and animation didn't bode well. For instance, when the elephants come crashing through the hotel they destroy and upend everything in their way inside, but when they hit the streets, things such as cars aren't crushed and nothing else they bump into seems to be affected yet when Jerry is thrown against a wall it cracks. Inconsistent.Lastly thing I have to say is that while adults may find this film to be a waste of time, especially if they're expecting a classic ""Tom and Jerry"" type film, kids may think otherwise. For all the negatives that can be found in this film, it was rather a perfect combo of fun and joy that can be enjoyed by the entire family.Overall:
A bit messy when it comes to storyline, a bit inconsistent when it comes to animation versus the real world, and not what some would come to expect with a ""Tom and Jerry"" type film. But it truly is a fun film for a family that just wants to enjoy themselves during a night in.""Should I watch this movie?"" My answer is 'Yes, if you just want to enjoy a fun, nonsense movie and No if you're a diehard ""Tom and Jerry fan'.Enjoy the show!",Tom and Jerry

Since this movie looks bad, I decided to watch it to see how bad it is.What I dislike is that every scene involving the pigeons have no relevance to the film at all, it has a ton of product placement and pop culture references for no proper reason, it tries too hard to be hip with the audience (social media, emojis, rap, Fortnite dancing, etc.), it focuses more on the humans than Tom and Jerry themselves and treats the returning characters more like side ones most of the time, the human actors underact everything, half the dialogue feels forced, toilet humor enough said, there is an awful attempt at modernizing a gag from the show by making Tom sing in Travis Scott levels of autotune, the soundtrack could have been done better, it is quite predictable, and the story is bad (better than most of Space Jam 2's synopsis at least)What I like about it is that it has consistent animation that looks better than most other live action/animation hybrid adaptations of other media, it retains enough of it's charm from the shows, the Tom and Jerry characters still retain their personality, the fights between the main duo are still nothing short of awesome, it has nice special effects, it has some decent morals, and the ending is passable.Overall, I thought this movie was very disappointing, yet it had it's moments. My expectations were low, and this movie is as bad as I expected. I do not recommend that you pay to see this movie, but rather watch it on a streaming service, through someone else's copy, or on illegal websites. If you want quality Tom and Jerry content, just watch the TV shows instead and save yourself 90 minutes.",Tom and Jerry
117,On_The_Mark,Would have been great without the live actors,8,30 April 2021,"The GREAT thing about this movie is the animation. Top notch and an absolute tribute to the original Tom and Jerry. The animated animals are all great but Tom and Jerry are really laugh out loud funny like the original cartoons. They studied their history and stayed true to the original in wonderful fashion.It's the rest of the movie that bogs everything down. Everyone is an annoying and an over-the-top character that is hard to watch. The story is awful and half the people are miscast. You'll find yourself just fast forwarding at parts to get to the Tom and Jerry stuff.I'd love to just see a fully animated Tom and Jerry movie with THIS animation and style (not like the 92 movie or recent TV shows).

119,cristinalinderman,An intolerable bland film.,1,5 March 2021,"* There is 1 end credit scene *The director Tim Story and crew brought an intolerable bland film. I wouldn't recommend this film not even for the main target audience which is the families. I also wouldn't call this a live-action film since it was mixed with animation, every single animal in the movie was computer animated making the scenes look ridiculous. A Tom and Jerry live-action film didn't work because they can't be the main characters where people are real and not animated. Tom and Jerry are there as background characters causing chaos in their cat and mouse chase like in the animated series. There are things that one can't adapt it only works on animation and not as a live-action film which this film wasn't since it was mixed up making the problem even worse. In addition to that, the script was a mess, they should have made another full animated film and not this combination.The composer Christopher Lennertz's music had a hip-hop vibe, and it was trying to keep up with the selection of hip-hop songs chosen for this movie. The music irritated the scenes even further as it was trying to give it a kind of hope of entertainment in the film.The movie had a good cast but their storylines were tangled in an awkward way with no direction to their characters. The only one that was acting great was the female actor Pallavi Sharda. I would like to see her in other serious roles, she deserves to shine in a film with a good script. There are other known stars like Chloë Grace Moretz, Michael Peña, and Ken Jeong who are fantastic actors but their characters were messy due to the fact of the dull script.",Tom and Jerry

125,andrewtisler,"Nostalgic, crafty, and full of wacky humor, ""Tom and Jerry"" is a riot!😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂",10,19 September 2021,"I love the ""Tom and Jerry"" cartoons. They're really funny and full of creativity, as well as some stylish animation. When I heard that Tim Story (Fantastic Four, Ride Along) was directing a live-action adaptation, I immediately felt nostalgic call-backs to prior cartoon shorts and television shows using these characters! And overall, this was a delight to behold, full of nostalgic vibes, great visual effects, wacky humor, and surprisingly a well-told screenplay.The story takes place in Manhattan, New York, and follows Tom, a stray blue and white tuxedo cat, as he gets hired by a teenage girl named Kayla Forrester to get rid of his rival Jerry, a brown house mouse who has taken up residence at a fancy hotel called the ""Royal Gate"", which is going to be hosting the wedding of Ben, who is the owner of Tom and Jerry's enemy Spike the Bulldog, and Preeta, who is the owner of Tom's love interest Toodles ""Toots"" Galore. Throughout the movie, Tom and Jerry's rival gets enhanced through the manipulations of the scheming events manager Terence Mendoza, resulting in immense chaos going on throughout the hotel and the streets of Manhattan. This movie's story is briskly paced, full of slapstick, and has some moments of honest emotion from both the cartoon animals and live-action humans. I like that the humans have a bigger focus in this movie. That was my only criticism with the shorts: the human characters didn't get as much attention as Tom and Jerry did.I also love how Jerry is not entirely flawless, and has these crafty tricks up his fur to get things he wants without anyone seeing him, and how Tom is skilled at piano-playing, as well as an expert on inventing traps to catch mice, which eventually works somehow. Kayla Forrester sort of serves as a human counterpart, where she wishes to help out with the wedding planning, and tries to get Tom and Jerry to get along or else she will lose her job. Terence Mendoza is also a perfect villain in this movie, with his scheming motives and creepy sense of humor, as well as the part where he tricks Tom into fighting Jerry during the wedding in exchange for letting Tom stay at the hotel for his ""heroism"".The mix of live-action and animation is great too. I love how well-animated every animal is, being incredibly faithful to the cartoons by making EVERY SINGLE ANIMAL a cartoon character. Their movements also give off some of the most cartoony moments ever, especially when Tom tries to catch Jerry with his slapstick movements and quick-witted skills.Also, this movie's original song ""Bouncy House"", performed by Flo Rida, is cool and fun to listen to. Brings me back to the days when Tom and Jerry were at the peak of their careers. Great song.To sum up, ""Tom and Jerry"" was a hilarious, crafty, and nostalgic feature, blending humor, visuals of both live-action and animation, and great storytelling all in one. Best hybrid film since ""Who Framed Roger Rabbit"" in 1988! Definite recommend for Tom and Jerry fans out there!",Tom and Jerry

131,dibeyendu,Unexpected gem of a movie,10,26 February 2021,"I didn't think much of the trailer, but the movie turned out to be surprisingly good. From the trailer, I thought it would be the usual Tom & Jerry stuff, with poor Tom getting subjected to awful violence that this cartoon is famous for. There is some of that, with Tom falling off buildings, getting electrocuted, having all manner of heavy objects falling on him, but it's only a small part of the film, with a broad wink for the director to say, ""yeah, yeah, buy haven't we seen enough of all that?"" What works for the movie is a solid story and a great script. The action is set in a high end NY hotel, which makes for a great backdrop to the mayhem. Everyone's getting set to host a major celebrity wedding, an all-American groom with an Indian bride, making way for a hilarious culture clash. The guy wants to impress his in-laws with an Indian wedding, which he has imagined as an extravaganza featuring elephants and peacocks. So there are lots of great cartoon animals, but the human cast, to its credit, don't let them steal the show. Chole Moretz is superb as is Michael Pena, who has the funniest lines. Sitting in the virtually empty cinema, I let go and laughed out loud through much of the movie.

133,neiljones1981,"Probably Closer To The Original Cartoons, But Still Quite Good On Its Own",7,4 September 2021,"There is no denying it, Tom & Jerry is one of the greatest cartoons ever made. Originally made in the 1940s and 1950s, the original cartoons are probably some of the most violent variations on ""cat chases mouse"" ever made. Of course as time goes by, efforts are made to tone down the violence and make the duo more family friendly.With every new variation, the characters move from tormenting the crap out of each other with axes, knives, dynamite and whatever else, toward what can probably be better described as organised chaos and who can make the bigger mess. We saw it in the Gene Deitch cartoons, the Chuck Jones cartoons and every later cartoon tamed them back.This new 2021 movie is closer in terms of the basic Tom & Jerry ""chase"" formula that worked for 160 odd episodes in the 1940s/50s, but Is the 2021 film better than the 1992 film ? Easily. That tried to be clever, and failed miserably. Here the cat & mouse duo can have their fights, their chases, their whatever else and it doesn't look too far out of place from the original cartoons. Yes they look different (how could they not?) and know social media but they still feel familiar.Yes in the movie Tom might not attempt to chop Jerry in half with an axe and Jerry might not feed Tom through a clothes mangle (kids, ask your parents or grandparents :)), but then again this is 2021, they were never going to do that anyway. The new style antics are very slapstick, never terminal (but then they weren't first time round either) but still fun.I will admit I thought I was going to be disappointed with this. I'm glad to say I wasn't. Tom & Jerry has never really suited a long form storyline and I suppose its one of those things that there will never be a perfect script for them.

Brrrr.What there is instead is a DESPERATE attempt to be 'in wiv da kidz' judging by the constant jive talk and social media references, rubbishy wall-to-wall R&B tunes which don't suit the material at all, blatantly politically-correct mixed-relationships in common with many other family movies these days and of course, lots of lots of animated cat and mouse slapstick.Oh, sure. A lot of it is passable (especially the stuff stolen from the FAR superior shorts). But with the ropey animation and frequent bias against Tom, it's hard to really enjoy it. Add to that a by-the-numbers plot about a boring wedding of two vacant people and the waste of the considerable talents of Chloe Grace Moretz, and you have a missed opportunity which barely saves itself from the cat's litter tray.Barely. It has some pretty funny lines. Tom and Jerry individually had some good moments, along with Butch (NOT the doggy doo-doo scene, though) and Toodles. Also, Joy The Bellgirl rocks.Still best ignored.

It seems Tim Story and the rest of the people involved in creating this mis-step either have not seen any of the original Tom & Jerry shorts, or have seriously misunderstood them. Off the top of my head, I can think of four different scenarios that would be faithful to the original cartoons and still make it relevant. And I'm not even WGA.After ""Who Framed Roger Rabbit"" set the animated characters-and-live actor bar (many years ago, no less) any effort that does not at least come up to that standard is inexcusable. It is, however, a good example of the lengths a studio will go to in an effort to try and salvage a movie that they know is off the mark: trailers and promos that make it seem better than it is, and paid reviewers to boost the overall rating.",Tom and Jerry
139,h-62007-26888,Worse than The Smurfs 2,3,14 April 2021,"Okay, I'll admit that what the animators did with Tom and Jerry is cool. The subtle 3D movements and their wacky animated moments when chasing one another are fine. It's just that the whole cartoon illusion is ruined when literally EVERY OTHER ANIMAL looks like this, resulting in the universe they live in to look weird and...well, disturbing.Oh, and that's just the animation. We haven't even covered the ACTUAL MOVIE. So, we're set in the big apple and there's some originality to the film's cringe by having RAPPING pigeons during the opening credits. So yes, things are already off to a bad start. As for the story itself, it's about a simple girl named Kayla with no professional experience working at a fancy hotel to put on the wedding of the century, but everything escalates out of control when Jerry hides in the hotel and Tom is going after him. Right at that moment, the plot is already predictable to the point where it's driven by all the cliches in the book.And this is not even worth mentioning the humor of the movie, which is probably some of the worst of hybrid movies out there. Granted, the scenes when Tom and Jerry chase each other are indeed hilarious and there are some genially funny remarks, but they rarely happen and most of the comedy is instead dedicated to the humans, delivering ""humor"" like gross-out gags, social media (like ""instamabooks"" and ""tikky tocks""), dull pop culture references, and anything else humans do that pass off as humor in a movie like this.Now, these characters are given personal goals, like Tom wanting to be a professional pianist to play for the world, Kayla trying to get a decent job, and Jerry trying to find a home to settle in. And where better a place for opportunities like those than in New York City, right? As admirable as they are, the way they tried to reach these goals make them DESPICABLY VILE. Why? Well, Tom pretended to be a blind man in the park to make some cash, Kayla conned her way to get into the hotel just for the sake of a job, and Jerry STEALS from people just for the sake of his own well-being.That, and it's also not including the other characters, like Terence, an all-business event manager, Dubros, the owner of the hotel who believes everything Kayla tells him, and Jackie, a short-fused chef who tries to make his work picture perfect. Not to mention that the OVERACTING from the actors like Chloe Grace Moretz, Michael Pena, and ESPECIALLY Ken Jeong really make these characters not that fun to sit through.So, to conclude, this is easily the worst live-action/animation hybrid I've ever seen. Like, I'd rather sit through Smurfs 2 than have to go through this nightmare again. Don't even bother. Just stick with the original cartoon.",Tom and Jerry

Nobody had high hopes for me. Even me. I already knew this movie looked bad but watched it anyway. It's...bad. Nearly terrible.
I'll explain why. I will say this that Tom was a really more likeable in this film. I was cheering him on the entire timePros -Fight Cloud Tornado - This was pretty much one of the only good scenes in the film. Spike, Tom, and Jerry enter a fight Cloud where they proceed to tear almost the entire hotel up. It looked so awesome and you could see the inside of it. It was pretty much coolConcept - Saying Tom and Jerry left their home to find somewhere new to live and so they chose a hotel. They caused destruction and in order for them to stay, they need to get along. That was a good idea in my book. Taking long time rivals and trying to get them to get alongOld Gags - They brought some of the old classic violence in the show and placed it in context of the plot. I thought it was pretty interesting to see something like thatEnding Music - it's catchyCons: This movie has a lot of it.Why Cartoons? - This movie literally has cartoons all over the place but nobody even acknowledges that they are cartoons. Everyone just considers them normal animals. So why even bother making them cartoons?Acting - the acting was just mediocre or bad. That's just the truth. It was just meh/badJerry- Yeah they made Jerry a d*ck. To be honest, Jerry in the original was a dick at times but he was the character you always rooted for. In this movie, he was just a big jerk that messed up things and purposely messes with Tom when Tom was just trying to surviveWedding - so there is a couple that was getting married. But you know what the problem is, so the wedding gets ruined because the husband wanted elephants at the party. She gets mad and calls off the wedding because she said she wanted a normal wedding. But I'm like, She didn't even try to discuss with him the marriage she wanted. I recall he asked if he should get the elephants and also said I'm fine with anything as long You're happy. She said Sure, let's have elephants. Like bro, what? HE HAD SAID HE WILL BE HAPPY WITH ANYTHING BUT YOU DIDNT EVEN BOTHER DISCUSSING WITH HIM.The Official Wedding Ruining -
So Micheal Peña wanted to sabotage the wedding and for good reason since the main character Kayla got him fired. He snuck Tom into the wedding and started to point to Jerry and tell him that he was talking trash about him and I'm like that doesn't make any sense because this happened when Tom and Jerry gotten along and he went to visit them. When did he even have time to talk to Jerry? In fact, he never even interacted with Jerry until that scene and that scene was him talking to themAnd the movie was just boring/dull to me until 50 minutes in.

143,MikeC19,"Not the kind of ""Story"" that I would have preferred...",4,19 April 2021,"I spent a lot of time waiting to see this movie. I hoped it would be an amusing film, with frenetic cartoon action, a few chuckles, and an overall fun time. I didn't feel, after seeing it, that it fulfilled it's duty as a fun family film.Now there are definitely some pros. The animation, the score, the look of the film. All good.I think, first off, that Tim Story was the wrong choice for this film. I think the directing was poor, and the acting was a little flat. (Not to mention he's directed R-rated content prior to this.) Some of the action felt very strange, like seeing the giant clouds of action when the characters were fighting, in the real world. That felt so weird to me.I think Michael Pena is a good actor and good at comedy, but as the bad guy, he felt out of place. Chloe Grace Moretz was an odd choice I thought, as well. She exists in a G-rated movie here, when we all know the R-rated films she's been in remind us of who she's known for playing.I think adding hip-hop culture to this film makes no sense, and throws off the balance of the film. When you get rappers playing cats, it feels odd.I like animated films based on cartoons, and live action/animated films, too.The main characters seemed like themselves, and acted right. So it's really the rest of the film that's just wrong.I guess this was a decent try, and I'd like to see more attempts to recapture the fun of older cartoon characters, but give them to people that know how to *really* write and direct well, and take as much time as you need to make it a fantastic film. Don't rush them, or give them to people that will make it their own thing, sidestepping how they should be. 4/10.",Tom and Jerry

Tom and Jerry movie begins pretty watchable with Tom and Jerry being introduced into the real world. Warner Bros idea of incorporating all animals as animated characters deserve applause as its well done. The movie tells the tale of how Tom and Jerry fit into the New York city. The movie on parallel tells the story of a grand marriage which is the element to with the cat and mouse tale is fit. The movie has given a new fresh start to the cat and mouse saga with some partly enjoyable moments. Incorporation of classic elements such as tom's expressions and Jerry's naughtiness has somehow gave the movie its spotlight. The film also has surprise characters from the classic Tom and Jerry which adds to the entertainment. Tom's effort to enter the building is another delight to watch out for.The trouble or cons began when the whole New York city is shown more like a colourful fantasy paradise at times with cringe characters. The film is watchable and bearable till the 50 minutes from were it turns too much messy and corny to be enjoyed. The movie from there on feels like a disney colorful thing which was a big disappointment personally. The idea of incorporating animated animals was a good idea yet it provides the movie more of a zoo visit feel near the end.In the end, Tom and Jerry(2021) will be remembered for its attempt of retelling the cat and mouse game on a new context but will be a disappointing experience as a movie.Rating:45%",Tom and Jerry

It's literally the most boring concept being done over and over again. As a Tom & Jerry fan, there's nothing really that much to like about this movie other than Tom & Jerry themselves. A really good thing about this film is that they don't talk. Thankfully, it's not offensively bad and it's not shockingly bad. It's bad in a very, VERY boring way. The old cartoons had heart, had soul, had emotions, and all of them leave a special place inside me because of how nostalgic they are. There's nothing nostalgic about this movie. It's just them cashing in on the series name, it doesn't look appealing, and I'll definitely need to drink a huge cup of coffee because of how much it puts me to sleep.

162,phobicsq,How can you mess up Tom and Jerry,2,14 May 2021,"Tom and Jerry is a staple of my childhood and as an adult it is still fantastic, that is the cartoons pre 1970's. Even the post 70's cartoons are good but the lack the greatness of the early days.This film takes Tom and Jerry, places them in the ""real world"" while treating them a lot of disrespect. Whoever thought about this story and then wrote the screenplay clearly had no idea what they were doing or watched Tom and Jerry, at least the good T & J. Throwing cartoons in the real world always bothers me and in this film the two characters are nothing more than a joke leaving the main drive of the film between the poorly written human characters.Some of the T & J antics are okay but the huge whirl storms of them fighting are poorly done and the infestation of a hotel is nothing new. The lame attempt at tossing in a romance which fractures only to be fixed at the end is icing on the cake to make this a horrible film. T & J could have been anyone or anything really as this film is NOT a Tom and Jerry film.It's a film about a girl who lies her way into a job at a hotel, gains the trust of wealthy hotel guests who are entitled-soon-to-be-wed brats, and after some major failures everything is redeemed. Tom and Jerry are side characters in their own film. This seems to be the norm with a lot of films that use popular characters (whether it be animated or not) to get people interested while having no interest in serving those characters.",Tom and Jerry
163,joostkale,It's a bland comedy and oh yeah Tom and Jerry are in it,4,28 February 2021,"Look, I can fight an entire essay on why this movie doesn't work, but it just comes down to this: We wanted a Tom and Jerry movie. We got a Teenage pop culture movie with Tom and Jerry in it. Why would you make a Tom and Jerry movie and not make them the leading characters? They are in the movie and are definitely the best part, but that about 30% of it. The rest of it is this bland comedy filled with forced pop culture jokes and predictable storylines. Every time the lead characters had a scene with Tom and Jerry, I was just waiting for it to be over, so we could go back to the characters I was hoping to see. The hijinks they get into are worth a laugh every now and then, but I felt more like a fun cutscene than the actual movie. Every non-animated character is unoriginal, bland and just not that funny. Yeah, if you make ten jokes one of them will make you chuckle, but most of it is just not fun. Just skip this and watch some good old Tom and Jerry episodes. At least Tom and Jerry will be on screen every time.",Tom and Jerry

165,mforsting,Tom and Jerry more like boring human story featuring Tom and Jerry as side characters,4,17 March 2021,I was so excited to see this movie but I got this garbage. Like seriously this movie had such awful acting and the story is so boring. And Tom and Jerry don't really appear that much in this film. The fighting between Tom and Jerry was actually good. And the other animals actors actually did well(even though they rarely appeared),Tom and Jerry
166,maharousewagdi,It was good but not like the childhood,7,20 April 2021,"The movie starts with the fight of Tom and Jerry. Tom and Jerry were thrown out of the old house. The story is about a woman name Kayla Forester, who gets a job in a hotel where a Royal Indian Wedding is going to be organized. But Jerry enters the hotel to make it his home. And the manger of the hotel gives the duty to Kayla to solve the mouse problem.Kayla hires Tom to solve this problem. And Tom and Jerry starts to fight again as usual.Tom and Jerry is a emotion to every child. It is one of the best cartoon that I have ever seen. In this movie, each animal was animated and every animal could talk without Tom and Jerry. And the dog name Butch was portrayed as another character which was a disappointment. As a slapstick comedy it was good. You can see Tom playing Piano. You will get flashback of your childhood but I don't think so you will enjoy it like your childhood.Chloë Grace Moretz was acting should be appreciate. Michael Peña was also good. The animation was also good. The animators have tried their best to this.",Tom and Jerry
167,gbozoki,"Unfunny, dull, bizarre trainwreck",1,4 July 2021,"TL; DR: Avoid this garbage at all costs.I'm taking 2 stars off because of Chloë Grace Moretz - I will never watch any movie with this inept, incompetent monkey in it.Another 2 stars off because Tom and Jerry are nothing but an afterthought in this movie - it's a Tom & Jerry movie and they barely appear at all and when they do, the animation is mediocre, uninspired and their scenes are just clones from the classic Tom & Jerry cartoons.I decided to take off 2 stars for the movie style - mixing animation and real footage might have worked if the makers of this movie made the smallest of efforts to make it work. (It did work well for Roger Rabbit well before the 3D special effect age.) They clearly couldn't care less and the visual end result is an insult.I took another star for the general ""acting"": the performances in this movie wouldn't qualify the actors to appear in low-grade commercials, much less in a proper movie. Pena's performance is the best of all (that I've seen; I gave up watching after about 50 minutes.) I can't imagine what Pena thought when he signed up for this garbage - he's a decent actor. The rest don't qualify to be called actors / actresses.A Tom & Jerry movie should be entertaining - it'd be Ok if the story is simple (assuming there's one) but this one couldn't even pass the incredibly low bar for that - I couldn't even force myself to finish watching it. I'm taking another 2 stars off for that.There are many more stars I could take off (music, editing, etc.) but IMDB only allows 1 as the lowest rating, there isn't much point to it. Filth like this movie shouldn't be allowed to exist and I sincerely hope that this review contributes to the end of the careers of the people that made it. Avoid at all cost.",Tom and Jerry

Way to stupid for grown ups and really boring for children. Also like in every single movie they produce atm made to please the SJWs.The music was pure trash. It did not fit in any way to a Tom and Jerry movie and was obviously forced onto the movie to make it more woke.But i enjoyed parts of the animated sequences. Well you have to laugh about them only like 3 or 4 times during the entire movie, but they picked up parts of the classic scenery. Tom getting zapped over and over again for no reason was a classic.The worst of the animated part, was that it was sometimes way to serious or even scary (prison scene) for a Tom and Jerry movie and that they repeated the same over and over again. Jerry flying towards the smell of cheese for example. Also sceneries like that the ""ball of fighting"" were several toon characters become a blurry destructive force are suppost to last a second before they break apart to hunt each other again and not half a minute making it look like something from a superhero movie.I guess you could cut out of the animated parts a 20 minute long scenery, playing the original music in the background and you would get a somehow decent Tom and Jerry episode that would be fun to watch.",Tom and Jerry

It was funny and very cute I do recommend it to any audience of any age. There is some adult suggestive scenes in there though . For a kids movie they do have alcohol use in it not heavy alcohol use but they do show alcohol which is very surprising for a kid show but it is rated PG.

This strays way too far from the Hannah Barbara cartoons. First of all, the wedding scenes make you feel like this is literally a Harmark movie what kid wants to watch that? And Tom and Jerry are just background characters and are just shoehorned in, at times it feels like they're background characters not the MAIN characters. It mostly focuses on a girl we don't care about named Kayla, who takes up almost 80% percent of this movie and it involves her stealing a resume? First of all, it's unrealistic. And secondly who tf does that?! And Kayla is painfully annoying to hear, I felt like I really wanted to choke her sometimes. Also, pigeons rapping....seriously?

It's nostalgia. Memorabilia.There have been very, very few movies that incorporated the dichotomy of live action and animation seamlessly. This was NOT one of them. They used Tom and Jerry as a marketing ploy, but the story had nothing to do with them. They were an afterthought in the background.""But it's for kids"". Sure. Have them watch this movie, then have them watch the classics. I guarantee you they'll find so much more enjoyment out of the classics. We're in the middle of a pandemic and new TV is hard to come by these days. By all means, watch this movie.

The only good part was the City Escape reference when Tom and Jerry team up to catch a car to save the wedding, which is the same as City Escape except Sonic is replaced with car with a lady and a cat, and the GUN truck is replaced with Tom and Jerry.

But still has no rewatch value.Now add to that some of the worst music you've ever heard. Really bad. Absolutely forgettable. Awful vocals. Poor tunes. None of it is memorable and it's really just not good at all.In many ways I think this movie was a platform for several first-time musicians of different starting groups who just don't have any talent. None of it familiar. None of it remotely recognizable. All of it new and most of it bad.I wish this movie was better. In a few ways it was funny and charming, a little bit.

To all the actors in this there must of been some contract obligation or something. There's no way anyone did this willingly. Stupid plot the whole cartoon real world thing doesn't work. No chemistry between anyone involved. This was all around just horrible. Please stop trying to bring old school tv to the new generation. They don't care lol. I can't see any child liking this.

234,mmwheatley,Terrible.,3,28 February 2021,"I honestly don't think this movie was a Tom and Jerry movie. More like some Tom and Jerry in the background movie. There were some shenanigans, but too much of the movie was focused on how someone got hired at a hotel instantly with no checks into who they actually are, and a ridiculous wedding, complete with exploiting exotic animals (fake though they may be).The dialogue was kind of dumb. The only time kids were laughing in the theater was when Tom and Jerry were being silly, and I just don't see how kids could grasp the point of the movie. I don't have kids, so maybe they understand more than I give them credit for, who knows.The movie was far, far too long, as well. If I were watching at home, I wouldn't have watched the whole things. Sadly, I went to the theater to see this. The song the pigeons sing at the beginning didn't fit. It started off on a bad note and never got better.",Tom and Jerry
235,Joshua_Armell,Not much of a point,3,26 February 2021,"Exactly as good as it looks. The best parts are when they're essentially making another episode of the original show. The animation is alright, but the story and human element is unnecessary.",Tom and Jerry

Like watching a copycat movie of a bad movie version of a well loved cartoon and so far I wonder why half the cast joined the movie. Seeing cast members like Chloe grace moretz and Michael pena in this movie is like seeing two doctors work temporarily at a fast food restaurant. I mean come on, you think they take a lesson from roger rabbit and give us a reason to like this movie. Watching this movie like watching a kids play version of Tom and jerry. Tom and jerry was a cartoon icon and they made this movie? The straight to dvd Tom and jerry movies had more effort than this movie and that says a lot. At least they were likable.

250,sreenesh-g-one,Could've been better.,5,28 March 2021,"In Tom and Jerry's live-action adapted film, it places the two central characters in a human world with animated animals, Instead of making the human-like version of the two central characters, which we have commonly seen in movies like Smurfs and Sonic, the makers stuck to the 2D layout with better modeling of it. In the old cartoon, each episode had a simple plot where Tom would get pissed off at Jerry, and then they both would quarrel like it's the end of the world leading to burns, bruises, and whatnot. In its latest adaptation, the movie begins with the same situation, but after the 30-minute mark, the screenplay drags by bringing just quarrel and quarrel over again. Instead of focusing on the classic characters of the old cartoon like Droopy, Spike, Toodles, Mammy two shoes, and many more, the storyline focuses more on the two couples Ben and Preeta whose wedding is where Tom and Jerry land into. In the end, it feels like they wrote the story for a movie of Ben and Preeta and later changed for Tom and Jerry. Apart from these flaws in the story, the Virtual Effects are out of the world and the VFX supervisors have paid attention to every single detail, and it's such a joy to watch it on the screen, especially when situations are slapstick. An interesting story or a unique situation where Tom and Jerry could have been placed would have made this adapted movie a much better one.",Tom and Jerry

The music was awful. It sounded cheap. That was a major flaw. It couldn't have been more annoying and inappropriately placed. Very poor job.
The violence is toned down. So is the action. It is kind of slow.
But I'll let the flaws pass. It's Tom and Jerry! A kinder gentler version for the snowflake children these days. They are a little to soft to see old cartoons unedited.
Too many triggers for them. They need a cute, soft version of Tom and Jerry. The real ones may emotionally scar them due to their upbringing.",Tom and Jerry

Cute animation (classic, loveable characters)
Nostalgia value (captured the magic of the original animation)
Music/OST (well scored and organized)Disliked:
Casting/acting (both equally bad)
Writing (the script was awful)
Dialogue (most of the time I wish the actors would just say nothing at all)
Length (felt way too long and lacked any depth)Having said all that, I stopped watching a little after the halfway point, and couldn't take any more of the horrible acting and terrible script-writing. Besides the very nice visuals created with the animation, blended in with the 'real-life' characters, ""Tom and Jerry"" was a terrible movie. If Hanna and Barbara were still alive, there's no way that they'd allow such a terrible movie like this to ever be released.",Tom and Jerry

277,forchennfederation,(*Insert Tom on Railroad Tracks here*),3,2 March 2021,"I used to watch old Tom & Jerry cartoons back in the day, as in back when I was a kid, and found it to be entertaining romps for their chaotic nature. So, while I wasn't so much as excited for the Tom & Jerry movie of 2021, I was at least willing to give it a shot and maybe even find it as a fun comedy as well as somewhat interested in the style that the film is going for with the classic style of animation implemented as 3D in a live-action film. Sadly, though, Tom & Jerry (2021) was a letdown; I won't say that it's terrible, but it still falls on the side of bad. With that said, let's go into why.So, the basic premise of the film revolves around Tom and Jerry moving into New York City, trying to make a life for themselves, only to run into each other and their longtime rivalry sparks again as it takes them to a very fancy hotel where Kayla, a young woman played by Chloë Grace Moretz, tries to work there (shortly after getting the job through a rather shady method). Once Kayla takes notice of their rivalry, she tries to keep them in check while setting things up for the hotel to host a big, extravagant, celebrity wedding and while a higher-up, played by Michael Peña, has his eyes on her for her to screw up.There's some things that Tom & Jerry (2021) has going for it. The animation is pretty good, as it emulates the frenetic nature of the classic cartoons while implementing into the live-action setting in at least halfway-decent fashion, such as when Tom, Jerry, and Spike, the dog, get into a chaotic tussle amongst each other that results in disaster; so, I do commend the animators on that front. I think the cast did fine for the most part, particularly Michael Peña; not saying that there's any Oscar-worthy performances here, but Peña and Chloë Grace Moretz did fine with the material that was given to them. I got some chuckles at points; not a lot, but I did get some, mostly from some lines that the groom character had. Some of Tom and Jerry's bouts were somewhat entertaining, at least on a visual level, though I have to admit that I felt more for Tom than I did Jerry in this film as Tom was just trying to get by only for Jerry to ruin things for him while stealing things in order to make a luxurious life for himself in the hotel. Unfortunately, for this film, this is where the positives end.The plot, with Tom and Jerry aside, is so generic and executed in such predictable, clichéd, and mediocre fashion that I found myself checking the time at some points. The only reason why this isn't a spoiler user review here is because I guarantee you, you will be able to predict every single plot point and story beat and how the movie will conclude so there's no surprise whatsoever; the movie even ends like any number of films that you'd find on the Hallmark Channel. So, I couldn't care less about what was going on in the film story-wise if I tried. And, even with Tom and Jerry taken into account, they're mostly just kinda there as a distraction for the kids so that they'd be able to sit through the generic story.
Now, as I mentioned earlier, Chloë Grace Moretz's character does a shady thing involving a resume in order to get her job at the hotel, so that kinda left a bad taste in my mouth as far as her character is concerned. Even when I'm supposed to emphasize with her as certain points, I didn't really feel much for her at the end of the day.
But, the worst part of the film would have to be the soundtrack. I found the film's incorporation of music of the R&B and hip-hop breeds to be absolutely pandering and obnoxious. The musical choices here really do come off like they were made by some out-of-touch studio executives just so the film could pander to modern young audiences and make it hip and cool for the kids. If anything, these choices are gonna make the film age about as well as milk. When are studio executives gonna learn that films are meant to be timeless, not timely? The soundtrack choices in Tom & Jerry (2021) really come off like what one could find in a lame kids film from the 1990s. So, that's all I gotta say about the soundtrack, as well as what I have to say about this film overall.At the end of the day, Tom & Jerry (2021) has its share of fun (and funny) moments despite there not being a whole lot of them, it has a neat visual style, and Moretz and Peña do fine for the most part with the material that they're given here. But, the mediocre-as-heck story, the weak characters, the terrible soundtrack, and the fact that Tom and Jerry seem to be in it just to spice the film up to potentially keep kids interested really bring the film down. I'll at least say that it's better than something like Scoob!, which focused so much on starting a franchise and following a cinematic trend that it failed to be a decent, fun movie. But, I can't say that I'm gonna look back on this outing from the iconic cat-and-mouse duo very fondly either. Oh well. At least I didn't pay to see this in a theater but instead watching it on HBO Max which offers a whole lot more bang for my monthly buck anyway, so thanks, Warner Brothers, for that much.",Tom and Jerry

So much fun Hannah and Barbera would be proud!,9,27 July 2021,"I do not get the low reviews this movie was so fun and creative and has hands down the best live action interacting with animated characters since Who Framed Roger Rabbit? The animation is absolutely Gorgeous and true to the spirit of Bill Hannah and Joseph Barbera's classic 40s and 50s Tom and Jerry shorts for MGM. I think the soundtrack is actually spot on for the scenes the songs are paired with especially ""Can I kick it?"" By a Tribe called Quest and ""Bouncy House"" by T Pain. Chloe especially shines here - I love her in anything. My household has watched this many times already for an instant boost.

It's absolutely awful with real life actors to blend in with animation as bad and cheesy as this, see Roger rabbit which was done many years ago and miles better... But when the action kicks in between Tom ,Jerry, Spike it's superb.. animation is excellent and generally you get alot of laughs like the old days. A random girl going into the hotel and gets a top job is a bit off but the animation fighting makes up the flimsy 'real life' storyline. As mentioned in another review they could just have Tom and Jerry fighting and would've been surfice. Missed opportunity but it does have its moments of shiny shiny comedy",Tom and Jerry
282,sharkfinsoup,Funny and nostalgic but a bit too long,8,27 February 2021,"For those of us who watched Tom & Jerry as kids, this is a wonderful mix-up of old and new. It brings back happy memories. It's a nice combo of animation and live action, with great shots of pre-Covid Manhattan. I laughed a lot. There is slapstick, but also a lot of clever and witty touches that you have to be paying attention to catch. The animation is exquisite. And there are a lot of other animated animals, who help the feature length time move along. The chase scenes are excellent. The weakness is the plot involving a celebrity wedding at an ultra-posh hotel, and maybe the fact that Tom & Jerry are going to have a hard time carrying a feature length movie along no matter what. I think a good 20 min could have been chopped and it would have been a better movie. Chloe Moretz does a good job as the main live action person....the only human who seems to be able communicate with Tom and Jerry and to treat them as equals.",Tom and Jerry

The plot takes a revengeful dark turn in the middle and the overall character development is so bad that its hard to root for anyone at this point. The supporting cast shine brightly in the spotlight and are one of the redeeming aspects of the film.
The sad part is that it could have been a great movie, but the different pieces just don't fall into place.

We all know that Tom and Jerry really really like to fight. But if one decides to actually do a full featured movie of this many many years later (their last cartoon was around 1967...) - a good plot and cast might become handy. The acting of Chloe was very bad to say the least. IMHO she should stick to action/drama movies (Loved her in Kick ass, and in the Equalizer, hated her here.)
BUT - kids don't care about plot or acting and this movie WILL make them laugh and have a good time, and in these d~mned COVID times we should let them laugh as much as possible, hence the 6 stars and not 2.",Tom and Jerry

Better yet, they went out of their way and made amazing callbacks to the original 1940s-1960s cartoons, by including famous jokes in a new style, and even using Tom's original screams, nicely placed throughout the movie.This time around, the emphasize of the story is placed onto the human characters again, but it's in good taste. Extra points for making Kayla and Terrence become some sort of symbolic, human versions of Tom and Jerry themselves. Nice touch: not only Tom and Jerry are animated 2D-characters in this movie: ALL animals are! Elephants, peacocks, doves, butterflies, a wedding couple's feline cat (and of course Spike), even a couple random dogs in the background are animated in the same, quirky animation-style. With just this little attention to detail, it becomes a movie that actually makes sense.All in all, this is exactly the kind of movie I expected out of a Tom and Jerry-movie. Chloë Grace Moretz crushed it (her interactions with the duo are flawless), as well as the rest of the cast, including Tom and Jerry as themselves.",Tom and Jerry

The real life actors did a good job enough job for the most part but the times where both worlds of real life and cartoon characters collided was the biggest downfall of the movie.

BUT even then, it's over music so bad it will give you lasting shivers well after the movie is over.So let's talk about the music. Tom doesn't speak but he... sings... in English... with autotune. What the...?! And the music is just... well, there is no music, it's mostly gangsta rap with PG-rated lyrics performed by who knows who? Even tracks I recognize aren't performed by the same people - they've licensed the same loops and made new tracks with unknown ""artists"", guess that's cheaper than what they wanted, but is it cheaper than a small groovy orchestra? I don't believe so... Closest you get to an orchestra is like a fourth track of the credits, where a millionth rap track of the movie loops an orchestra sound for a few seconds before introducing a synthetic beat. Rubbing the salt in my wounds.But I hear you say - who cares what the music is if the movie is good, right? The story, the acting, that's what counts! Let me tell you - the whole movie is a romantic comedy with a plot so idiotic and acting so bad it will make your four year old facepalm. But it wouldn't matter if there was any Tom and Jerry in between, right?Right, agreed, I wouldn't mind! Except Tom and Jerry are third class characters, after the leads and a plethora of supporting actors (to me most memorable was Joy who had like 15 seconds of screen time, and I can remember more of her than T&J, the ones this movie was titled after - what does that tell you about the writing?)I would give it 1/10, but it gets a +2 for a Droopy cameo.

Kayla (Chloë Grace Moretz) applies to a big fancy hotel, which is hosting a big huge wedding. Only problem is, Jerry the mouse is in the building, and nobody wants him to interfere with whole ceremony. Then Kayla hires Tom to get rid of the mouse problem. Downside is, Jerry ain't leaving without a fight, so he throws everything he's got Tom. In the end non of them wins, they just keep fighting until one yields. Don't know when that'll happen.So this film was, dare I say it, the best thing to come out of this year. First off the animation on every animal, including the main duo, is just *chef Jackie kiss* amazing. Yes the plot is kinda cheesy, but hey, it's at least kept true to the classics, with original ""get this mouse out of here"" trope.If I can take away something from this film, probably the pop music, except bouncy house and Tom singing, but the music should be something that isn't always trendy, even the ending should have the classic Tom and Jerry theme. But over all I really enjoyed seeing Tom and Jerry throwing each other around once again.

Tom and Jerry is no exception and is exceptionally misguided.The only positive here is that at least they didn't use a CGI animation style. The animation aims for the 2D style of the original but its slickness still looks too plain and lacks any depth. Combining this with live action and the lame romcom story that comes with it just makes me wonder why they went this route instead of just a full on animated movie.Tom and Jerry are really just side characters to the humans. The typical cartoon chase antics from the Hanna-Barbera cartoons are there but the biggest problem is all the extra nonsense thrown in. The story around the wedding is of the lowest common denominator, has some terrible acting, and is unfortunately the focus of the movie.And worst of all, the movie keeps blasting rap music, which is so far from the spirit of the cartoons that it's insulting.",Tom and Jerry

335,RhyZe-UK,Lacks the boldness & beautiful animation of the original 1940's Classic Shorts...,4,27 February 2021,"I really tried to like this movie as I'm a lifelong fan of Tom & Jerry, and recently managed to find the new remasters of the first 40 shorts in 1080p and watched them all, only to become absolutely addicted to it and ended up trying to find the rest.So, with this all really fresh in my mind and remembering many of the gags I used to love, it is a huge shame how you can truly see the amount of things Tim Story has lazily copied directly from the shorts. Now, if they were expanded on and were executed with even more comic polish then I would applaud him for raising the bar on a classic gag, but instead what we do get is a sub par version of them that actually feels like a disservice to the original storyboard writers who came up with them that absolutely left me in stitches every time no matter how many times you watched it.That is the true magic of Tom & Jerry, they are timeless icons who have established traits & qualities not only within themselves, but the entire world they live in. This film on the other hand, clearly does not understand the source material or does, but refuses to acknowledge it here with what I can only call 'personal preference soundtracking' rather than possibly combining the old orchestral score with your genre choices or even sticking to the classic fully and elevating it even more.The plot also all just feels way to safe, almost as if the original concept designs for this film were produced solely from intense meetings with WB execs trying to navigate how to make this story through pure bulletpoints and politically correct motivated plot devices, that it all just turns into this highly formulaic unoriginal story with no real weight, other than to show the brief moments sprinkled through of true comic slapstick T&J (which is where 2 stars come from) and the other 2 are for certain scenes where they managed to create some brilliant animated atmosphere where the 3D models look really great (e.g Dog Pound scene) and of course the legend that is Micheal Peña who definitely stole the show whenever he was on screen.I think the main thing I struggle with in this film, is the jarring mesh between live-action & what is almost nearly 2D animation that adds the main problem here: Why in 2021 do we have a film starring one of the most famous Duo's of all time, backed by a powerhouse studio WB, be actually worse production than a 1988 Film (Who Framed Roger Rabbit?) that literally did exactly the same thing but achieved it with flying colours? Does not make sense.Then again I think the last real problem here is not utilizing the great animation model's of all the classic characters of the 1940 - 1958 Shorts that for me will always be the true character designs of these lovable guys. They just hit the mark and also evolved through time, but by and large they had a very distinct look that WB tried their best to copy in their recent reboot of the Tom & Jerry show, but they literally just look 'flat' with no dynamic as well as over saturated colour that is just too 'Flash' Animation style for me...Unfortunately, they probably decided to stick with the recent reboot animation style to be unified with that series, which I do understand but after trying an episode of it, I just felt irritation for the animation style (which is so overwhelmingly modernised & digital that it probably takes a 1/3 of the time to produce a 24min episode compared to the hand drawn original 7min shorts!) and the lack of compelling storyboards with bold & original risqué gags was the reason I ultimately turned it off.This very much feels the same, however I did make it all the way to the end and even the bonus scene, so I would say it is worth a watch for the target demographic, but also for anyone into the recent reboot or completest fans of Tom & Jerry.PS - I wish Droopy had more screen time! Haha",Tom and Jerry
336,kathy84,Good on the whole,7,10 March 2021,"So I haven't been to a theatre in a year, and don't expect to ever do so again. Not out of fear, but out of wanting to avoid having to deal with all the new rules, which I assume to be permanent. So it was a nice surprise to see this, a new movie that promises to be entertaining, available for streaming. Anyway, it was well done. Some strange parts and questionable directing decisions but on the whole it was good. As someone who watched Tom and Jerry as a kid, I can appreciate this. Still not sure if I would've liked an entirely animated movie more as opposed to the combination of live action and animation, which seems to be the standard approach with movie adaptations of old cartoons in more recent years. The lead actress, the interim events manager, was charming. One other actress seen early on and later on looked so much like Justine Bateman that I was surprised it wasn't her. Animation was well done, with lots of nods to the old series. Overall entertaining. Worth seeing more than once. In any case, it's a reminder of a world not so long ago where things could be normal. I hope that won't be impossible to go back to.",Tom and Jerry

Unfortunately it ended up being the first kids comedy I took him to where I couldn't even get a laugh out of him. The storyline chosen for the movie is above young kids heads. It's as if they forgot what made Tom & Jerry, Tom & Jerry. The adults got way too much screen time, there wasn't enough slapstick humor, barely any really, and the little humor it did have wasn't really funny. I wanted to love this movie, but I think my kid would concur that it's his first dud.",Tom and Jerry

340,joeimp-88143,To the humorless reviewers of this movie:,9,2 May 2021,"Boy, I'd hate to host a cocktail party with you all as guests. This was a great modern animated film. There was all the cartoon violence you'd expect to see from these two. No lame CGI. None of the politics that gets shoved down your throat in every Disney flick, or the crude jokes you hear in the Dreamworks movies. Seriously, I didn't catch a single take on current events. And the plot involved a man and woman in love planning a wedding. Gee imagine that!This movie was funny, CGM was cute as the protagonist, and the animation was solid with the look of old school hand drawn cartoons. If I have a complaint, it's about 10 minutes too long. Also you would have gotten a better performance from a tree than Colin Jost.I felt like my dad was taking me to the movies again. I commend WB for releasing this movie. If you're looking for something similar that also has terrible reviews, check out the recent Addams Family release. Another great and safe family movie.",Tom and Jerry

And what Tom & Jerry fan is going to care about a fancy wedding in a hotel? As a fan, I want to see the dynamics between T&J and not all these other filler characters that are unnecessary.I couldn't watch more than halfway through, as it was evident that it was going to just be bad. This movie doesn't give kids a good story, nor does it give T&J adult fans a story. It just a script with two loved characters to get people to watch. Skip this.",Tom and Jerry

Other reviews will tell you in details of what went wrong, but what I cannot understand is, it is 2021 and yet they still can't get it right.

355,michelgizy,"Good, but not great",7,12 March 2021,"Honestly, this movie is a mixed bag for me. When I first heard about it, I was actually hyped. I used to watch Tom and Jerry a lot on Boomerang in my childhood, so I was hoping this movie would bring back memories. So did it do that for me?Yes...and no. There are definitely some problems that need to be addressed.The animation is definitely my favorite part of the movie, and it's really cool that all of the animals are animated. I like the art style, it's unique. I will say that some of the animation doesn't work (like when Chloe Grace Moretz's character is holding a cat), but it doesn't bog down the rest. The biggest problem I had was the text that appeared when Michael Pena's character was talking to Tom and Jerry separately, and they just repeat everything he says to them. It felt like everything was being told twice in that scene. Other than those minor problems, the animation is one of the better parts of the movie to me.The slapstick was a hit or miss. I definitely felt like a kid again watching it, but it doesn't happen enough in the movie for it to resonate. Though, all of it felt like stuff I've seen from previous Tom and Jerry shorts. It would've been great if they had created their own slapstick, though that's not saying much since there has been so much of Tom and Jerry in the past. It's predictable, but nostalgic. Even though you can just go out and see all these gags in the shorts.However...let me get into my three main problems with this movie.Problem number one, which is arguably the biggest criticism of this movie, the balance between live action and animation is way off. The titular characters have maybe half of the movie's screen time, and this isn't the first time that's happened when they've got into movies. I am so tired of Tom and Jerry movies not giving the main characters enough screen time. Like, I get it that it would get old and tiring to have the entire movie be slapstick, but literally the opening scene are rapping pigeons. There are just so many scenes where the duo aren't even on screen or they do a plot with them, but it doesn't help the wedding plot. For example, Jerry taking the ring could've been cut out entirely. Like, there was no reason to write that in, it doesn't do much for the plot because there's no substance to it. When I first heard the ring was stolen, I thought Michael Pena's character had stolen it, but no, they don't do that.Problem number two, the live action bits. They don't do it for me. The plot itself feels like they're just shoehorning Tom and Jerry in it. The characters are...alright, but they're not given good direction. The character development is just...I don't know what it is. The main character weasels her way for a job that she's not qualified for...with a ripped up resume. The bad guy literally gets his job back, even though he was sabotaging the main character, and then they give him a potential love interest. The writing isn't awful, but it feels awkward at times. When you spend most of the movie with the human characters with plotlines like this, it works against the live action aspect of the movie, in my opinion. I didn't hate the entire plot, but I just need a reason to be invested in the humans, which they don't do. And most of them do not seem like characters we can relate to. Kayla herself starts off by weaseling her way into a job that she has no experience with, and the backstory to go into this is not conveyed well. Her reasons for her actions is explained, yes, but we never get the hint that this was a point of her character. It might've helped her character more if we get to know besides what we see on the surface. Not to mention that there are too many characters anyway, and I'm having a hard time who to root for in this film with the humans. It's like, do I root for Kayla, who is not even a morally good character, do I root for the hotel manager, the weird bellhop girl, the groom going overboard? And when we do learn about them, we're not given much from them. So not only do you have Tom and Jerry on the sidelines for half of the movie, you have the human characters taking up most of the runtime.Need I remind you that this movie is almost 2 hours long.Problem number three, the soundtrack. WHY is it rap and R&B? When I think of Tom and Jerry's music, this movie's soundtrack is definitely the last thing on my mind. I don't even remember the old music being played here. The music in this movie just doesn't add up. It feels like whoever added in it is just trying to be hip and cool with the kids. And honestly, we already have enough shows and movies trying to do that. When your movie starts with rapping pigeons, it doesn't paint in my mind that this is a cartoon about a cat and mouse always fighting. I don't mind the music, it's just...not the right choice for the concept of the film. It's kind of like with Quest for Camelot, but in the opposite direction.Edit: Another problem I found after rewatching the film. The animated characters do not have one set presence in the movie. For example, Toots and Spike are pets, but then we have animated dead fish for people to eat. And then Tom gets a job, but then he and Jerry are thrown into the pound. Or, and this is the most important, the humans can interact with them, just not without the animals talking. They can guess what Tom and Jerry are trying to say. It's really inconsistent, are they seen as meals, pets, or real people? Is it all of the above? Because if it is, that's really dark. If these animated animals are treated like regular people, you'd think that someone would have a bit more of a different reaction if they're sitting right in front of them to eat. This just creates some major worldbuilding problems.All in all, it's not the worst Tom and Jerry movie ever, but it's definitely not the best one. But give the movie this: At least it's not the 1992 movie where Tom and Jerry speak.",Tom and Jerry

How else would you take a 10 minute cartoon from my childhood and bring it into a modern day hour and a half film. Well what the did here was just that. They kept all of the great gimmicks I remember, much the same slapstick humour, they look and act the same. The nostalgia feeling was great. Me and my girlfriend who is much a nuisance like Jerry mouse, were very much entertained, and we turn most trash off pretty quickly. The supporting actors were funny. There were many funny parts all moving around what would be a somewhat real life event, albeit greatly exaggerated to fit in with the daft nature that is the Tom and Jerry show. I really don't know what half the reviewers wanted to see, apparently this wasn't it. But it was good enough for me. Maybe they can send their suggestions in for the next film.

But many things drag it down. The movie feels like a first draft first try.The movie isn't really about Tom and Jerry. They are featured in a movie about a girl trying to work in a hotel.Most if not all of the human cast is boring and unfunny. I thought the head manager of the hotel was kind of funny. And the head chef too. I thought the alleycats were going to be characters but they aren't sadly. I thought the female cat would be an antagonist but she does nothing.The plot is lame. Focusing everything around a stupid wedding was the worst possible idea.Opening with the pigeons is pure cringe.Tom singing in autotune almost made me turn the movie off. I was watching the movie with a friend and they abandoned me at this point.The only good thing about the movie is Tom and Jerry chasing each other (And the random Droopy cameo), but I have to say, I bet if I go back and watch the movie from the 90's I'll enjoy that more.

I loved watching the classic shorts, the TV shows and movies/specials as a kid. And it is still to this day one of my favorite franchises, regardless of its ups and downs.I've been optimistic about this film when the trailers were released, mostly because the nostalgic level was high for me. I saw it on HBO Max, and it was fun. I loved the animation and slapstick style that the franchise was well known. There were moments that made me laughed and fanboy, and the cinematography was surprisingly great.However, the human characters weren't that interesting despite the cast. There were some jokes that were clichéd and thinly written, the story was kinda convoluted, and the messages weren't great for kids to learn from, which is weird.Overall, this movie is entertaining for the Tom and Jerry moments, but for everything else, it's unfortunately problematic.

The movie was good, it had lots of slapstick like the original, but it wasnt as thrilling as the old ones. I like the references like when Tom was singing to the cat in the hotel, Tom trying to push spikes head wounds back in his head but it keeps coming back. I'm a huge Tom and Jerry fan and this movie made me happy (kinda). I feel like they could've made T&J a tad more realistic like the new Sonic movie, but they tried to make them just as cartoony as the original and I like that. 7/10",Tom and Jerry

Looking for a position at New York's fanciest hotel, the Royal Gate, Kayla is tasked with helping event manager Terence Mendoza to set up a high-profile wedding, after presenting a stolen resume as her own. At the same time, Jerry takes up residence at the hotel, where his regular shenanigans involve stealing food and items to ramp up his new lifestyle.Preeta Mehta and her fiancé Ben, along with their pets Spike and Toots, arrive at the hotel, where they are met by Kayla and Terence, who both greet them, unaware of Jerry stealing from Preeta's handbag. As the couple is escorted to their rooms, Jerry's presence is made known, which puts the wedding and the hotel itself at risk. Kayla offers to help catch Jerry without anyone knowing, which impresses Henry Dubros, the hotel's general manager. In her failed pursuit to catch Jerry, Kayla befriends a bartender named Cameron. Meanwhile, a depressed Tom falls into despair, until he notices Jerry inside one of the hotel rooms. An enraged Tom goes after him, leading to the pair fighting and destroying the whole room. Kayla comes to check, due to noise complaints. She befriends Tom, and, persuades Dubros on hiring him to catch Jerry, despite Terence's disagreement.After many failed attempts, Tom designs a big mouse trap and finally succeeds in getting Jerry out of the hotel. Meanwhile, Kayla learns from Preeta that her engagement ring is missing and offers to help without Ben knowing, sparking a friendship between the two. Preeta also reveals that Ben hasn't been listening to her ideas about the wedding and has ordered various animals. Learning that Tom has gotten rid of Jerry, Kayla and Tom celebrate with Cameron, with Tom playing a song on the piano to impress Toots. However, Jerry returns and reveals to Kayla that he had Preeta's ring with him and agrees to give it back to her, if she lets him stay. Before Kayla can agree, Terence returns from walking Spike. Jerry hides in Kayla's coat pocket, sparking a chase during which Spike, Tom, and Jerry demolish the hotel lobby.Terence is put on leave, while Kayla takes over as event manager, for returning the ring stolen by Jerry. To prevent any more of Tom and Jerry's shenanigans risking the wedding, and, thus her job as well as Tom and Jerry's own chances of wanting to live in the hotel, Kayla tells them that they have to get along and spend the whole next day far away from the hotel, if they want to stay, to which they agree. Tom and Jerry bond during their trip, but are taken to a pet compound, after they inadvertently disrupt a baseball game.A vengeful Terence separately visits Tom and Jerry in their cell and secretly tells lies to Tom about Jerry and Jerry about Tom (behind their backs), angering them both. At the start of the wedding, Terence incites Tom and Jerry to fight, which ultimately results in the rest of the hotel getting wrecked, the wedding ruined, and Kayla leaving in shame, while Tom is physically kicked out by Terence.Knowing that it is their fault the wedding was ruined, Tom and Jerry finally put their differences aside and convince Kayla, the hotel crew and a reluctant Terence to work together and fix up everything. They pursue Preeta on an electric skateboard and aerial drone and lure her to Ben, which results in the wedding being held at Central Park, better than originally planned. Ben apologizes to Preeta and admits that he was only trying to impress her and her father and he got carried away, while Kayla, along with Linda Perrybottom, the woman from which she took the resume, get jobs at the hotel. As the film ends (with Tom pulling a curtain featuring the classic ""The End"" headline from the cartoons), the wedding continues, until a mishap caused by Jerry reignites his longtime cat-and-mouse battle with Tom.In a post-credits scene, Ben finds he is being charged full-price for both weddings, thinking it's a joke.

379,brandonhuggins,This wasn't a Tom and Jerry movie. This was a movie that had Tom and Jerry.,3,8 March 2021,"This movie had potential, but it took every single shortcut it could. It focused WAY too much on the non animated characters, about half of whom could've been eliminated and the ""plot"" wouldn't have suffered in the slightest.It was boring, unimaginative, and the best parts of the movie were rehashed jokes from the original cartoons.I had high hopes that this movie would bring back this iconic rivalry for a new generation, but it felt like nothing more than a poorly written, poorly planned movie with a story that was absolutely non-sensical that tossed in two famous cartoon characters in hopes of staying interesting.I wouldn't even suggest putting this on for your children, it would be more enjoyable putting on old Tom and Jerry cartoons.",Tom and Jerry

I started watching it with very less expectations but I loved it very much! The acting is great. Scenes are well shot and cinematography is brilliant. I especially loved that shot of Tom and The Moon in the background. I also, quite surprisingly, liked the slightly different animation. Such a feel good movie that (obviously) defies logic but is so fun to watch! If you love Tom and Jerry and their total chaos go for it!",Tom and Jerry

The idea was nice.. I dont get what People pretended to be, The Avengers? Titanic? Avatar?.. Tom and Jerry was just a nice old cartoon, far from being the best cartoons, but you liked them, this movie make you go back to the old days with a storyline with it.. WHATS THE F..BIG DEAL.. PEOPLE CHILL OUT.. Doesnt this Pandemic teach us to enjoy the simple things of life? I enjoyed the movie! Dont pay attention to those people who love giving low raitings.",Tom and Jerry
385,g-96034,Worst thing I have watched in cinema,1,28 March 2021,"This piece of trash is definitely the most outrageous insult to Tom and Jerry. Especially the aesthetic aspect is so weird that looks like you put some badly-made 3D model in a film with imovie.They choose not to maintain the original 2d style animation, and they do not make the character look real at all like in picachu detective. I do not understand what the hell the makers are doing.",Tom and Jerry
386,mlyonsfl,Not the Cat's Meow,4,28 February 2021,"A disappointment. Tom and Jerry are shoehorned into a live-action plot about a grand wedding at a New York Hotel and the results are uneven and strange to say the least.Also, instead of looking for inventive ways to update the characters, loud rap music is used, and not too effectively.There are some amazing chase scenes between Tom and Jerry, but that doesn't help fill a 101 minute movie.This classic cartoon duo deserved better and so did the audience.",Tom and Jerry
387,azharimaul,Outstanding. And this is my first review ever,8,2 March 2021,"I see a lot of bad reviews here so I think I want to try to give a good one.Story 7/10I agree that the story is a bit boring, but it's a kid movie, all you have to do is make this movie at least visually enjoyable. The story has a simple message and it's delivered beautifully and well balanced in a sense that this movie is family friendly, what I mean is this movie has a story that adults can still enjoy and kind of relate and if you are watching this with your kids this is the chance you can give them some life lessons, and not a hard lesson one, just a simple lesson (sometimes just listen to what your partner (or could be anybody) really wants, not what you want, etc)Characters 6/10Human characters in this movie are just a normal everyday person, they don't have that kind of strong scripted characters that always give you surprise or anything, they are just interesting enough. I like that they put some humors init. The subtle sarcastic humor this movie deliver through the character lines about the world that they live in are just delivered in a balanced way, not exaggerated and not flat. Just perfect for me👌.
Other reviews said that this movie is kind of more focused to the real human characters, not Tom and Jerry, but I think that's still okay. Just like I said, the humans characters don't have that strong or deep characters that will outshined Tom and Jerry so it's still fine.
So this is what I like about this movie, all of the animals are animated and some of them can talk! And this movie blend that logic with real humans in their world in a pretty clever and their unique way.Animation/Effects 7/10The animation is very cartoonish, not blended realisticly to the real world, and I don't think that's bad.
Children are watching this movie, so you supposed to give them ""visual candy"" like Tom and Jerry and maybe other characters chasing each other or running around and mess up things, and they put some successful materials from the animated series in it and I think that is a cool concept. Adults can still enjoy these, I think (animal tornado is a classic one). This movie did those things very well.Enjoyability 8/10This is a movie that fun to watch if you don't take some things seriously and just sit back and watch. This movie is not perfect and not that very bad either. This movie is beautifully balanced!",Tom and Jerry
388,gavinplante,Low Expectations Were Still Too High,4,28 February 2021,"I remember watching Tom and Jerry reruns with my dad on Boomerang as a kid. I remember watching the over-the-top slapstick and loving it, nothing incredible but fun for an hour or so. So when I heard that there was going to be a movie of it, mixing live-action and animation, I was skeptical. And after seeing the trailer, my exact thought was ""Um, okay? This'll be interesting."" And that thought was being kind.This was the first movie I've seen in a theater in over a year (small town theater and using Covid safety protocols: masks, social distancing from the rest of the audience, etc.), and I feel like I should've saved that experience for something better. Granted, I'm not the target audience, but even putting myself into the mindset of my child self, it still wasn't amazing.The animation is nice. It's nothing mind blowing, but it's decent to look at, matches the aesthetic of the original cartoon, and blends well with the live-action. But the animation doesn't cover up the fact that this movie drags on...and on...and on.Chloë Grace Moretz and Michael Peña are always enjoyable to me, but they, as well as the rest of the cast, are held down by a script that doesn't lend itself to an enjoyable movie. The whole movie concludes with a tacked on ""don't lie/give people a chance/work together"" moral that just...flops.This movie feels like it doesn't know who it wants to appeal to: the original Tom and Jerry fans won't enjoy the ""hello fellow kids"" jokes (Tom flosses while celebrating. This movie released in 2021...) and basic plot, but kids will get bored with the sections that don't have the titular cat and mouse. And believe me, those parts of classic chaos of the original are VERY far apart.Overall, it's a mess. I wasn't expecting a masterpiece or a revitalization of the source material. But even with those low standards, this still bombed for me. If you have HBO Max, it's an easy family movie night pick, but don't expect the whole family to enjoy it. If you're thinking of seeing it in theaters, save your money and time until something else comes around.",Tom and Jerry
389,tylerja-81762,A pretty cute movies with some pretty noticeable flaws.,6,27 February 2021,"All around I'd say this movie was well worth the watch, especially since you can watch it for free with a HBO Max subscription. I loved Tom and Jerry as a kid so to get them once again on the big screen was a treat. The animation and live action hybrid was decent but at times, just as many similar movies, it tends to not mesh as well as you'd like it to. The acting was great with Chloë Grace Moretz once again showing off her diverse acting abilities. There are quite a few annoying tropes littered throughout which is to be expected with a kids movie. Not to mention the very rushed and meh end. Alng which really bothered me. All around this was a decent movie but it has its problems.",Tom and Jerry
390,mahediisback,Not THAT bad!,8,1 March 2021,I watched the film with my 4 YO lil sister and we both enjoyed it a lot. It's not a movie you'll absolutely love and admire your whole life but it is a one time source of some good entertainment and pure nostalgia. I would have hated if they used strong vfx to make tom and jerry into 3D and suitable with live action. I'm very happy that they kept those characters 2D and still could manage to suit em inside of a live action 3D world. At least it is better than the new spongebob movie.,Tom and Jerry
391,joshualucashall,Ruined Tom and Jerry (avoid),2,26 February 2021,"I wanted to give this a chance. I tried. Warner Bros is just profiting off the name ""Tom and Jerry"" for this one.

403,lulubobs30,Just dull,1,3 July 2021,Not expecting much from a Tom and Jerry movie other than to entertain my kid. Having said that I do love the cartoons so was hoping for a few giggles. Epic fail on that score. My 7 yr old was bored after 10 mins. At the 40 min point he actually asked to leave. The story is about a couple getting married in the hotel tom and jerry are staying. It focuses so much on this weak and poorly thought out story that it feels tom and jerry are an after thought. The animation does not work at all with the real world acting. It has none of the charm and slapstick you expect from the famous duo. It was a big fat meh!,Tom and Jerry
404,blazaxx13,Pretty terrible,2,6 March 2021,More than half the movie doesn't even feature tom and jerry. It's more of a movie about a hotel and their staff and guests. Don't pay for this. Wait til it's free if you have to watch it,Tom and Jerry

The human actors are the only thing that make me cringe at this movie. I'm certainly glad I didn't have to pay for a movie ticket and concessions to go see this giant waste of time.

It was really really good! The technical side of this movie is amazing. The Animators really did an amazing job to bring these characters to life in real life with the animated look. The animation was so brilliant! Only problem I had with this movie is the framing issue. If you watch the movie in a regular 21:9 theatre screen sometimes the head gets chopped off. Even in Credits I can see that a lot of stuff are chopped off due to poor framing for regular movie screens. Shouldn't be a problem in IMAX screens but it was bugging me the whole film.Pros:

The original series was so out there with it's slapstick that it seemed impossible which made it funny. This does the same but we've seen it before so it makes it less magical.

443,ronfleming71,Impressions dependent on expectations,8,1 March 2021,"There are plenty of bad reviews here. Most of them seem to be reactions to unmet expectations. I brought few expectations to the table and therefore was not disappointed. I had one hope: that the characters Tom and Jerry would look and behave as the characters I remembered from the original cartoons, and the movie fulfilled that hope.The integration of animated elements with the real world was brilliant. The characters were true to the original. The storyline was formulaic and predictable, but I don't think anybody is watching Tom & Jerry for the plot twists and complex, nuanced character development.If you want to see a Tom & Jerry cartoon, watch one of the originals. If you want to see faithful renditions of the Tom & Jerry you remember in a new context and don't have a lot of specific expectations, you might just enjoy this movie.",Tom and Jerry

It's 5% OG Tom & Jerry and 95% Hollywood fluff that had me rolling my eyes throughout. The few giggles are simply not worth it, I'd rather re-watch the original animated series.If I can save but one person from watching this drivel, I will consider the last few minutes well spent.",Tom and Jerry

I didn't know what to expect and started to watch for the hell of it but as I got further into this movie it just won me over. Fun and imaginative and plays for the kids and adults.

447,ohgeezelouisee,Did we watch the same movie?,2,27 February 2021,"I don't understand the good reviews. I have a pretty high tolerance for dumb movies made for kids. Or movies made for adults nostalgia. This is neither. My 5 year old was bored and I was amazed at how bad it was. The storyline is so bad. It's one of those movies where you wonder if the writers forgot where they were halfway through. Theres zero character development. Any semi interesting story is completely brushed over. It feels like every character is just allllmost there but not quite. The beginning problem isn't really resolved... just kind of put aside. It's just all over the place. And tom and jerry are sort of side characters. Definitely not the main characters, not even secondary characters. The interactions with humans just aren't well done and leaves you wondering what they're looking at. I'm honestly just not sure how they messed this up so horribly. Unless your kids drag you, skip it. And even then try to talk them out of it.",Tom and Jerry

450,asim-69092,I just can't believe How bad everyone rated this Movie.,10,23 March 2021,"This movie was a breath of fresh air to this franchise. It's a fun family flick. You can't possibly expect them to be the avengers and save the universe. This was not even close to being a bad movie. The ratings actually almost discouraged me from watching it.
I think there is a generational gap that is being formed in the type of entertainment we all enjoy. And I always believed Tom and Jerry could be a timeless tale but, I stand corrected even on YouTube old cartoons get alotta dislikes. There aren't too many good new ones coming out. Gravity falls was great tho ngl.
Specially the left propaganda being fed to the children. And think this is why they had the realities of life changed and want everyone to be friends. That is not the case irl.
Just enjoy the movie guys it's a hour well spent those who are TnJ fans. They totally did the two justice. And the cast's acting is great too.
The movie deserves a solid 8 in my books but, had to offset these illegitimate reviews.",Tom and Jerry

From the beginning Jerry is a thief and can easily be seen as the bad guy in this. Tom chases him not just because he is a cat and Jerry is a mouse, as the original always was. The back story of the movie is ok at best, sloppy and boring at most. The few moments of Tom and Jerry being themselves is good, but way to few.",Tom and Jerry
459,marieweb,Not that good for an adult but good for a child,3,27 February 2021,"We just sat down with our seven yr old to watch the movie. It just wasn't what I had expected. Sure some might think great and I see a lot of 9 and 10 stars but if we are talking seriously it surely isn't true. My son said he'd give it a five out of ten because he laughed at a few parts, but he said meh it was ok but not good. He liked Tom and Jerry and when they were running around fighting like they do in the cartoons. This movie mainly focused on a wedding and a girl trying to get a job at the hotel. There's a lot of distraction by the others that Tom and Jerry really didn't shine. It shouldn't of been called just Tom and Jerry because they were not the main topic. You do get to see some of the cartoon bickering and those were good, but very few and far between. Just wasn't like I said what I expected. And glad we didn't spend money because it was on HBO max that we have. I just wished they gave focused more to the main two characters. Hope this helps some people out there without giving away spoilers.",Tom and Jerry

The style doesn't fit well as a genre or a full
Length feature, so understandably many ""professional"" critics will dismiss Tom and Jerry.Look past the obvious plot holes and uneasy look of these movies and you have a family classic that sits well with Garfield (where the cast Bill Murray and Brekin as Jon are the justification for such ventures)

It includes a lot of hip hop with lyrics that have nothing to do with the action and pulls you away from what's on the screen.

I can feel readers of this review rolling their eyes. But the obvious messages of lying, cheating, and stealing are sickening. No, no! Don't write a movie teaching children about getting what they want through hard work! Let's show a poorly animated cat make a decision because the devil on his shoulder told him to. Devil-worship aside, it was still horrible. It wasn't funny. It lacked heart. And I know better to expect Oscar performances from a kid's movie, but wow! Were the actors actually paid for their work?

Old TJ featured fights and violence but it was always in the set of ""play"" and ""it's fun, cause he deserves it"".This movie starts with Tom trying to make some honest living on a street. He has a sign ""Amazing cat TOM"" and because he has glasses, someone claims he is blind.
He never says that anywhere... anyway so he plays his keyboard. And suddenly Jerry comes in and just steals his money. After that, Jerry fights Tom who just wants to play his keyboard and break his keyboard. Great. After that, Tom is rolled by a van. After that, Tom is slammed by a cargo door and kicked by some shoe in his guts.Like seriously? Anyone thinks this is normal? That this is ok message and fun?This continues as Jerry and the main characters get through the story by just cheating and being scrubs... Didn't finish the movie, I don't want my childhood ruined.

I was super excited to introduce my childhood fun to my children. My kids aged 5 and 3 lost interest in the movie with in first 15 mins, for me it was utterly boring. This was a movie about a girl trying to make it in hotel industry with tom and jerry in the background.The movie isn't for young kids, doesn't appeal to adults.

But one thing that is clear as day is that this movie is awful, I mean just atrociously stupid. Yes, I understand this is a children's movie and I completely understand that it give us nostalgia for the god ol' days of 'Tom and Jerry'. But this movie was just.god awful. Where do I even begin.
The story: Is there really even a story. There is some chick with blond hair who is eagerly seeking a job and unrealistically lands this job at a hotel. But is greeted with a mouse problem(AND COULD YOU GUESS WHO IT IS) , with a post in the building and a marriage ceremony to prepare what are the odds of finding a cat for this job. This is supposed to be a tom and jerry movie, in which they barely have screen time and when on screen are greeted with absolutely the lamest action sequences. Tom and Jerry is supposed to be funny, it just felt to dry and harshly tried. If that makes since. Another thing the lead actress Sabrina Carpeter is that her name. Why is she in this movie. All of the Actors in this movie dont play their role good AT ALL. All the scenes come off as super dorky and just cringy. Yes I completely understand it's a children's movie but there are PLENTY of movies that have interesting characters and better actors for these particular roles. NOT SAYING THAT THESE ARE BAD ACTORS, THESE ARE GOOD ACTORS WITH TERRIBLE ROLES. Also I dont remember any of their names... all of these characters with boring and predictable. I just feel this movie was a cash grab because of the hype of Tom and Jerry. And not a pure hearted written children's movie. EXTREMELY DISAPPOINTED.",Tom and Jerry

There's a lot of issues with the film, like the pacing, some of the characters are a little bland, the plot is just alright, and the humans get a bit much in the screentime department. By most critics standards, it would just be a mediocre experience at best. At its worst, well... it's a Cinematic Disaster.And yet, despite its mediocrity, I was completely enamored with the film and had a blast with it. I found myself totally in awe of the insanity of the lobby destruction and wedding crashing scenes. And the soundtrack was pretty solid as well.It's not great, and yet I had a great time with it. If you're in the mood for a mediocre movie, well here's my top pick. Since I had so much fun with it, I just don't have the heart to give it anything lower than a 7/10.",Tom and Jerry

Poor storyline, okish acting. The mix of human and cartoon characters just didn't go well. A full on animation would have been a lot more entertaining.

Seems like directors were clueless about this release audience - basically it doesn't suit any age group - too primitive for +15y and uninterested for under 13y.
Seems like mismanaged COVID-19 project - entire crew had no clear idea what they are working on and nobody explained the full concept or there was no such...

556,goldenquartz,Alright I knew I'd find low ratings everywhere...,7,28 February 2021,"Can we just appreciate the fact this movie tells a better story than movies like Looney Tunes Back in Action? This movie captures Tom and Jerry better than a movie would as a live action animation hybrid. Can we just appreciate that the classic cartoon humor we love is everywhere in this movie? Ok yeah sure the animation lacks visual effects but calm the frick down we don't have to say every animation movie is bad, I mean yeah we've had A LOT of letdowns since 2020, or even 2019, but does this one REALLY deserve it as well? Would you rather watch the 1992 movie where they both talk and bore you to death with a rip-off plot of Disney's The Rescuers? Seriously though, this movie does a better job. The live action actors and story is never perfect in a hybrid film, so no it isn't here either but it's actually better than I expected. We get a decent side plot with someone getting hired at a hotel and trying to keep everything at peace. And as Tom and Jerry fight, they end up at the hotel and actually tells a decent story for a feature length film. We even see other characters like the bulldog and the other cats seen in old cartoons and even the direct-to-video movies. And they actually do a great job with the classic slapstick humor here, it actually made me laugh many times. And yes they do become friends at some point in the movie but not for like the one from 1992 where it's just boring and with cluttered dialogue. It's okay to see a difference from their routine for a LITTLE while. But again it's not even for long honestly. The animation does again lack visual effects but I can tell what the animators were going for, they made the animation more of plastic CGI to look closest to their traditional animation style. So visual effects are just limited, but they are there at times. The acting is fine, nothing amazing but it's nothing lame. Chloe Grace Mortez does fine for her role as the live action protagonist. So please calm down and maybe watch the original Tom and Jerry movie and THEN watch this one, then make your review. This movie deserves credit, we've seen much worse. You have too.

571,igrt,Not what I was hoping for but not as bad as reviews,6,28 February 2021,"Look, I am a General Manager of a theater. I think first you will get differing opinions from people who saw it in the Theaters (who seemed to GENERALLY enjoy it) and those who watched at home on HBOmax (disappointed).So I watched it at home and then worked the theater opening weekend. Why am I mentioning all of this? Because some movies just play better off the big screen. Typically action movies but also movies like this. Its a different experience and certain things are more forgivable when experienced in theaters. At home, it easier to be very critical about all movies. In saying this, I am fairly disappointed in the movie. But understand what its going for.1) Its a rough start. Had I not stuck through the first 10-15 min (which were painful), I may have easily fell into the overly judgemental phase that many succumb to. I decided not to be miserable and overly sensitive based on the intro. But 20min in, it does start picking up and I allowed myself to enjoy it from there.2) Yes, T&J seem more in supporting roles at times. This has been my biggest issue. I agree that an all cartoon movie would have been more critically accepted and rewarded. But I understand the route they went. I just feel that the story should have centered around T&J and their other animated friends and the humans more of the supporting cast. In the original cartoons, humans were rarely a part of the story. This should have been a 60/40 split of screen/story time (in favor of T&J) but is a 60/40 split in favor of the humans.3) Look the Hiphop music is cringe worthy at times and I understand why some people didn't enjoy it. As a Hiphop producer myself, I understand & appreciate that Hiphop music is the biggest Genre on earth now but so i know it is used to define & represent our era & culture in many films- BUT, I also know when it feels forced. And it did. But it wasn't gangsta rap like alot are claiming. The intro song is so far from a gangsta song. And the artist (Tribe Called Quest) was about as non gangsta a rap group youd find in the 90s. As a person who definitely respects and appreciates urban culture, it just seemed to pressed here. They should have kept it more suited to be enjoyable to all of the 40-70 years old watching and for the 5-35 year olds. However, the soundtrack seemed to only look to accommodate the younger generation. Bad move.4) The acting was cheesy. But what do you expect? Its meant to be. Did you expect Oscar worthy dialogue and performances? People often jump on the actors for these type of things but the truth is, the actors don't write the scripts nor do they direct themselves or have tons of influence on interpretation. A great script can end up completely different by the time its consumed on screen. Studios will give so many notes on what direction they see fit for the film or even demand certain things take place to ensure the movie is going to make money. They cut corners or try and save money. Alot of stuff out of the control of the actors. They could be directed to act cheesy and may not have the luxury of quality takes if a studio is rushing a project or it simply doesn't have the budget to extend deadlines etc. The acting would have been more forgiven had they been less involved with more focus on T&J but choosing to focus more on the human storyline, exposed this style of acting to more criticism.5) Tom and Jerry had some awesome moments. But a few were meh. I felt there could have been more old school rivalry but I'm not mad. Once again, give them the spotlight more and that resolves this complaint too. For those complaining about them being in 2D...its not that big a deal. It was intended to be so to pay homage in which the way we know them. Im glad they did this. Someone said Roger Rabbit did a better job at making the cartoons feel really there. Really? A film almost 30 years old did a better job? That reviewer must have been an animator on that movie because as cool as Roger Rabbit was and how innovating it was at the time, they too were 2D cartoons- not 3d, so I dont see how it was better.In conclusion, I enjoyed it once I got through first 20. I do feel in a way its a waste of a ""reboot"" or whatever. But only because I feel it should have been all cartoon. Or at the least 60/40 (in favor of T&J) on screen time and story line. It just felt like T&J were infused to this human world. Its never explained why they're just cartoons either. Like did 2 universes collide etc? I recommend seeing at theaters to maximize what its going for. Quirky. But its biggest mistake is overly trying to appease a younger demographic (who knows nearly nothing about the original cartoon) while what seems like having little to no consideration for the older generation who was of course going to see their beloved T&J.",Tom and Jerry

The parts with Tom and jerry on screen weren't bad but weren't really worth the time. I knew when I saw the trailer that it would be another heartless cash grab but I thought that maybe they'd actually show Tom and jerry doing funny stuff for more than 10 minutes of the runtime. I was wrong. Just watch the original Tom and jerry, it's 100% better that this trash heap.",Tom and Jerry

Animation was horrific, plot was terrible, ficus wasn't even on Tom and Jerry. Why focus on all the human characters?? And who did the animation? It was really poor for a Tom and Jerry movie.

587,bzajac-64029,My Movie Review On Tom and Jerry,8,23 March 2021,"I thought the movie was good so I would give it a 8/10. Not the best movie but still enjoyable even if it had flaws.
Here are the reasons why I like the film. For one, they keep the same slapstick and goofy tones in the cartoon. Number two the sound effects are really good because of their cartoony sound effects and original sounds from their 1940's cartoons. The CG and 2D animation is really cool and really brilliant, it reminds me of space jams animation of them mixing live action and 2D animation. As a matter of fact I think they got space jams animators. The movements are really cool and nicely well done. It practically deserves an Oscar, A Golden Globe, An Annie, A Peabody Award, A Kids And Teens Choice Award, A Shorty Award, And A People's Choice Award For It's Animation. The animation is even better than the other Tom andJerry Films due to them mixing CG, 2D, and live action. As a matter of fact the CG they made on the 2D characters makes it look like their hand rawn and I LOVE the facial expressions they made on Tom, Jerry, and Spike the Dog. This is how the animation is well made, beautiful , nice, and even great especially with Spike the Dog. And that is why I think the animation is GREAT and I hope you guys enjoy the animation in this animated movie. And that is all i have to say about this GREAT animated movie. So enjoy this movie guys and that is the reason why this movie is really good and why I would highly recommend it. So yeah. Overall I would give this a 8/10 stars.The Problems
Okay so this movie is not perfect, it has some flaws.
For one the scenes are really long and two Tom didn't have an owner.
If you guys watched the original cartoons you would know that Tom has an owner. But in this movie we don't even know who the real owner is because of these scenes that go on for too long and at the end it will really frustrate you. The other problem is why did they decide to have live action people? I mean it could have been fully animated.By: Sultan",Tom and Jerry
588,gingerdr-48425,Freaking awful,1,12 March 2021,"This was terrible, and why is everything hip-hop based now. Lord it's getting old now. I remember when it used to be cool but now it's just overkill.
I wish they did it like the other movie where they talked and we're buddies. That would be a lot more PC anyway other than trying to kill each other and talking about poisoning Jerry",Tom and Jerry
589,matthermansen,Even my kids were disinterested,2,13 March 2021,"I struggle to find the proper words to express why this was a terrible movie. First off, it was a comedy that wasn't funny. That's bad enough, but perhaps worse is that none of the characters were worth rooting for. The main character played by Chloe Grace Moretz, was a terrible human being. She lied, stole and cheated her way into getting what she wanted at the expense of others. Her rival slash pseudo bad guy (the guy trying to thwart her deceptive scheme), was a selfish individual who really was just trying to do his job, but who was willing to destroy a couples wedding in order to spite his rival. The only decent character was the bride-to-be, a woman of Indian descent who was so ineptly matched with a childish, rich white guy who never listened to a single word she said. Yet in a predictable fashion, everything worked out in the end for people who didn't deserve it.",Tom and Jerry
590,petshowboys,Why is this done?,1,17 March 2021,"It's done so badly that it seems to make the studio buy reviews.
Just a Spanish shame.
Everything is bad here, from script to animation.
How can this be drawn in the 21st century?
I have only one version - the artists have forgotten how to draw with their hands, because of their work on the computer.
It's even worse than the work of Rembrandt Films.
Where did hundreds of people suddenly get nostalgia for these ridiculous boring jokes and horrible acting and paint-drawn animations?
People who have never seen classic T&J could write about this.
It's just a kick in the back for Hanna and Barbera.
Why, why shoot something that is obviously worse than the original?
The best option if Tom and Jerry co-starred with Chloe in her film ""Shadow in the Cloud"", where Tom would play the role of a goblin, and Chloe stuffed his face.",Tom and Jerry

595,sarahandrews-24355,Not as good as I hoped,5,23 March 2021,"First of all I would like to say that this movie isn't BAD. It just wasn't as good as I was hoping on it being.The first bad point is the animation. Alvin and the Chipmunks had better animation than this movie. And I understand they wanted to make it live action for a younger audience but I think that it would have been better as a fully animated video.Now as for Tom and Jerry themselves, the story doesn't even revolve around them mainly. It's mostly about the fraudulent hotel worker Kayla joining the hotel to prepare for a wedding. Couldn't the movie mainly be about Tom and Jerry themselves?And for Kayla, I hated her lines. As a teenager, I really saw that they tried to add in slang and make her ""cool"", but she just sounded awkward and weird. The acting of the humans in the movie wasn't that good and should be better.So if the acting, animation, and plot were better, I would have enjoyed this movie more.Thank you for coming to my TED talk.",Tom and Jerry

650,zoemcphee,"Brilliant Nostalgia Masterpiece Film, The Best Live Action/Hybrid Film based on a Cartoon with Friendship and Humor",10,20 May 2021,"I went to Showcase Cinema De Lux, Coatbridge to see Tom and Jerry: The Movie (2021) - UK Version with my gran which I got the two tickets to see my favourite cat and mouse duo on the big screen in luxury for free excluding snacks and drinks with my showcase Insider club card credits. My wish came true seeing Tom and Jerry on the big screen, we sat in the front row seats like some big wains seeing cartoons basically while there's a wee girl with her dad decided to sit in the fourth row of the theatre which there are only four people including me and my gran even though I'm 21 almost 22 in August but I don't care because I'm a big Tom and Jerry fan. A great heartwarming and hilarious story about Tom and Jerry reuniting with each other in Manhattan, New York City causing chaos in New York City and trying to get their own dreams like Tom wanted a music career while Jerry wanted a new home to live for the rest of his life, meanwhile a very energetic young lady called Kayla who always lies her ways to get everything she wants especially getting a job at The Royal Gate Hotel to get involved with the wedding of the century. The plot is spitted into two different stories just like what Universal did for The Secret Life Of Pets 2. Example 5 mins of Tom and Jerry and then 5 mins of Kayla, 5 mins of both Kayla, Tom and Jerry together and then the pattern repeats until 20 minutes towards the end of the film where all of the human and animated animal characters were together for the wedding party. I love the scene when Tom and Jerry hanging out with each other around the big city and being BFF's for the day which it's was very adorable.Brilliant humour and gags all from Tom and Jerry, the animated characters - (etc Spike, the alley cats, toots) and humans especially Chef Jackie, Terrance and Kayla which some of the lines from them were very funny and creative, Tom and Jerry's gags was absolutely spot on and there's also some awesome new original gags. I was absolutely laughing my head off the whole time.Outstanding 2D/3D Animated Characters designs from the amazing British animation studios, Framestore which I really love the animated characters especially Tom and Jerry even that it really blends into the real world especially the scene where Tom tried to get into the hotel to catch Jerry in the rain that Tom looked really realistic, even though most viewers who watched this movie said about the animated characters looked cheap and lazy but I had to disagree with them. The animation on the animated animal characters is absolutely spot on.Good decent music choice, the music that the composer of this movie picked was pur-fect fit for a New York City setting, especially the emotional scenes where Kayla got fired from The Royal Gate Hotel thanks to Terrance's revenge to get Kayla fired which he got framed for both Kayla's and Tom and Jerry's chaos, Then Terrance kicked Tom out which the cat sadly walk and climbed himself into a cardboard box in the rain were one of the ragging pigeons singing the song called ""Something Beautiful"" which I absolutely love it especially the scene where Jerry came along to Tom with a hot drink and trying to make up to him to start over on a new page and work together to fix the wedding from their own mistakes.The Human acting is absolutely fantastic and likeable but my favourite human characters were Kayla - (She was very energetic and entertaining to watch), Joy - (She had an excellent personality of quietly seeking up to people especially Terrance that every time Joy appears on the screen in the movie she gives people frights which it made me laugh), Chef Jackie - (He was a very awesome character especially he pretending that the chef was a non-swearing version of Gordon Ramsay. He was a very entertaining and funny guy), Terrance - (He was a very excellent and funny character especially it came to his funny lines which it's was hilarious).I absolutely love the voice acting on the animated animal characters especially Spike, Butch, Topsy, the Elephants and The pigeon announcer which was voiced by Tim Story himself. Tom and Jerry's laughs, giggles and screaming were absolutely brilliant and nostalgic which some of their sound effects in the movie were from MGM's Tom and Jerry original cartoons. I love Tom's singing voice (voiced by T-bone) which was absolutely brilliant in the scene when Tom was playing on the classic hotel piano to Toots as he was trying to get the female feline interested in him.Overall Tom and Jerry: The Movie 2021 was absolutely a brilliant masterpiece film based on the silent cartoon cat and mouse duo. To be honest, Tim Story had done a fantastic job directing this film, The animators both Framestore and Warner Animation Group did an outstanding job working on this Tom and Jerry feature film, both the human actors and voice actors were brilliant. The Story was heartwarming and Hilarious action-packed scenes including Tom and Jerry skateboarding around the big city on a car chase to catch the bride (Brilliant scene), Tom plays on his piano just like Elton John and Jerry dancing along with Elton Tom in central park (Fantastic Scene), Tom and Jerry watching a baseball game where Tom catches the ball with his own baseball (really Clever) and much more scenes in the movie I loved. This Tom and Jerry movie is a must-watch movie on the big screen for all true Tom and Jerry fans while you can, don't listen to the bad reviews some people can always be absolutely dumb-bags. Even though I wouldn't recommend this movie for young children under 5 due to they wouldn't be able to understand the concept of Tom and Jerry being silent cartoon characters because the wee girl in the theatre didn't seem to enjoy the film that she got bored after 10 minutes into the movie. I fully enjoyed Tom and Jerry: The Movie 2021 after I've waited almost 5 months for the cinemas in Scotland to reopen to see it on the big screen that it's saved me sixteen quid to get the movie and watch it at home. So I'm giving this awesome movie a 100 out of 10.Tip: Next time when you visit Showcase cinema with your insider club card if you have enough credit on your account when you book ticket online or at the desk to get your film tickets for free even though I've been saving up my credits on my insider card from the last cinema visits with my siblings.",Tom and Jerry

652,djdosier,I loved it,10,28 February 2021,Okay so every single person is like trashing this movie saying it's not good and a complete waste of time but I found it to be very entertaining and funny it kind of reminded me of Space Jam and who framed Rodger rabbit to me it's really funny it was nice to have something for an hour and 47 minutes to escape from the crazy world we're living in right now is it by any means a masterpiece no but it was entertaining to me I grew up watching Tom and Jerry cartoons and I think they did a very good job with the live action animation letting them be cartoons and not CGI it works at least it did to me if you are a fan of Tom and Jerry you will love this film you should check it out I thought it was awesome and funny and the cast was great,Tom and Jerry
