0,MartinHafer,"Wow, I can't see why this film has such a low rating on IMDb",8,10 June 2007,"I am a forty-something year-old father and not the sort of person to which this film was targeted. I like foreign films, classic Hollywood and even silent films and am very critical about the horrid quality of the films that have been released over the last thirty years. Because of all this, you would assume that I would hate THE PRINCESS DIARIES--I sure did. But when my oldest daughter insisted we buy this film and watch it together, I was genuinely shocked that I found myself enjoying and being sucked into what is essentially a teen and pre-teen girls' film. Due to terrific writing, very good acting and a fairy tale-like quality to the film, I was very, very impressed.The movie, by the way, reminded me of a much better retooling of the old Grace Kelly film, THE SWAN. However, unlike THE SWAN, this film was really engaging and sweet.FYI--SPOILER ALERT!!! I have never seen the sequel to THE PRINCESS DIARIES and have no desire to. That's because the fundamental message in the first movie is that you need to be true to yourself and your friends and no matter what the pressures were, the new princess did not forget her friends or nerdy boyfriend. However, the main plot idea of PRINCESS DIARIES II is that she's in search of a prince to marry--what happened to the message and happy ending to PRINCESS DIARIES?!",The Princess Diaries
1,TheLittleSongbird,"Charming and likable, though somewhat uneven.",7,11 June 2009,"I really liked this. Loosely based on the books by Meg Cabot, Princess Diaries is a charming, if somewhat uneven film, though it does boast a spirited and lovely-looking Anne Hathaway in the title role. Though the film does belong to Julie Andrews as her grandmother, the wonderful actress who brought us classics such as Mary Poppins and Sound of Music. Hector Elizondo is also fun as Joe. The film has some lovely locations and costumes, and the two actresses are well supported by some very talented co-stars, such as the lady who played the bitchy Lana. The film also has a feel-good nature about it, that just adds to the film's appeal. However, the film isn't without its flaws. The story had an oft-tendency to become predictable, and the script while very funny on the most part, had some clichés here and there. There were some scenes that were a little, and that word I am putting a lot of emphasis on, slow and could have been developed a little more. On the whole, and I genuinely mean this, a charming, likable, if not entirely successful film. 7.5/10 Bethany Cox.",The Princess Diaries
2,bkoganbing,A few social graces,7,19 December 2018,"I think the Magic Kingdom really tapped into something basic in The Princess
Diaries. What young girl especially one as socially challenged as Anne Hathaway
is in this film would't like to wake up and be told you're a princess.But that's what happens to Hathaway, a young high school girl who pines for the
high school hunk Erik Von Detten, but when we meet her blows lunch during what is a debate class. She's a social misfit and her only real friends brother
and sister Robert Schwartzman and Heather Matarazzo.So after that debate performance she finds out from mother Caroline Goodall
that her recently separated and deceased dad was heir to a Monaco like principality and her grandmother is the Dowager Queen Julie Andrews who
lives over at the country's consulate in San Francisco as they do. She's high hatted them for years and it comes as some shock to Hathaway that she's a
royal heir.The rest of the film is taken up with Hathaway learning a few social graces.
And when the school finds out she's a blood royal princess Hathaway still has
some problems with a squad of mean plastic cheerleaders headed by Mandy
Moore.There are some very funny moments in The Princess Diaries, but it's also a
rather sweet tale of a girl coming rather publicly of age.For those who dream of dreams coming true, The Princess Diaries is your kind
of film.",The Princess Diaries
3,SnoopyStyle,Anne Hathaway is adorkable,7,19 December 2014,"Mia Thermopolis (Anne Hathaway) is a dorky invisible teen who everybody steps on. She lives with her mother (Caroline Goodall) in an old fire station in San Francisco. Her only friend is Lilly Moscovitz (Heather Matarazzo). Her dead father's mother Queen Clarisse Renaldi (Julie Andrews) of Genovia has come to town to tell her that she's the only heir for the throne. She is shocked since her mother never told her any of this and she doesn't want to rule. Joe (Héctor Elizondo) is her new driver. She is given princess lessons by her grandmother. She is picked on by mean girl Lana Thomas (Mandy Moore) and her friends, but she is infatuated with Lana's jock boyfriend Josh Bryant. Meanwhile Michael Moscovitz is in love with Mia.There are many things wrong with this movie. It's cheesy. It has a few too many stupidity. The mother needs to be played by somebody more compelling. The one thing that this movie has is the lovely Anne Hathaway. She is terrific as a dork. She actually makes the cliché ugly duckling work. She does great pratfalls even when the movie turns into a slapstick affair. And then it has the regal Julie Andrews who can really class things up when she wants to.",The Princess Diaries
4,Hitchcoc,"It's Not Art, Folks",5,9 January 2017,"I watched with my daughter. She was intrigued by the story and really likes Anne Hathaway and Julie Andrews. Certainly, I've never read the books, nor has she. So I can't go off on Disney ruining this for everyone. What they did, and is so often done, is take the things they wanted from the books, namely their version of the characters, tweeted the setting and the events affecting the characters, and did their own movie. The author had to weigh in on this, I suppose, although authors are often victimized by movie producers. Anyway, what we have here is a lightweight movie with a shy teenage character who finds herself in the old I'm-no-prepared-for-this mode as she becomes a monarch in a little country. What we have then are encounters with her friends and mean girls and a boyfriend who is only interested in feathering his nest. She has a major decision to make and that's why we continue to watch. I'm an adult male and so I defer to those who have an investment in this. Remember, it's just for fun.",The Princess Diaries
5,Horst_In_Translation,"Not bad, but potential for more",6,3 April 2016,"""The Princess Diaries"" is an American movie from 15 years ago that runs for almost 2 hours. It was the big screen breakthrough for Academy Award winner Anne Hathaway. And even if her character is the undisputed lead here, they still chose Julie Andrews (whose character really anybody could have played) as the first credit. Pretty ridiculous if you ask me, even if Hathaway was pretty much a nobody back then still. But let's talk a bit more about the contents of the film. It is a nice story about an ugly duckling becoming a beautiful swan and even a princess later on. Of course, it was pretty difficult to make a stunning actress like Hathaway look bad in the first third of the movie. The first genre description here on IMDb is comedy and I think there are some funny moments, but overall I would really see it more as a family film, maybe even a romance movie. Sadly, the romance part is as uncreative as predictable.Some good moments in terms of Hathaway's performance and in terms of the script also make this one work. Nonetheless I must say that the entire royalty story was not really necessary here. It did not add too much for me. Instead, I would have preferred maybe a film that would have run for 90 minutes only and been more of a high school comedy. The movie actually attempts too much and sometimes it seems a touch of try-hard in achieving genuinely funny comedy. And there are many occasions when they do not succeed. I would say Hathaway is almost too good of an actress (also back then already when she wasn't even 20) for the material here. This is a decent film, but not one that could not have been better on more than a handful occasions. A sequel was really not too justified. Finally, before I finish the review, I don't want to forget to mention Mandy Moore: I am a great fan of her and it is always nice to see her, especially her ""Stupid Cupid"" performance. This one may have been among the main reasons why she got cast in ""A Walk to Remember"", one of my favorite films of all time and there she plays a completely different character than the vain spoiled school girl here. As a whole, I recommend ""The Princess Diaries"", mostly for Anne Hathaway's star-making turn.",The Princess Diaries
6,lee_eisenberg,this ain't no Fonzie,5,17 January 2013,"When I first heard of ""The Princess Diaries"" around the time that it came out, I was a little perplexed at learning that the star shared a name with William Shakespeare's wife. To be certain, my friend and I had plans to see ""Rush Hour 2"", and we couldn't understand why ""TPD"" was playing on more screens (fortunately, we managed to see ""RH2"").Anyway, now that I've seen ""TPD"", I'm going to offer a weird analysis of it. Probably the most confusing thing about is that Garry Marshall directed it. Who's he, you ask? The creator of ""Happy Days"". Yes, the man who gave us the coolest greaser in history now gives us a story of a benevolent but awkward teenage girl who learns that she's actually the heir to a throne, and has to learn how to behave like a princess, with mixed results. Maybe the fact that Marshall gave these dissimilar pieces of work says something about the duality of humanity.This is the sort of movie that I usually only watch to heckle like the characters on ""Mystery Science Theater 3000"" do to really crummy movies. I didn't heckle this one, however. I guess that since Anne Hathaway has done a number of more serious roles - ""Brokeback Mountain"", ""The Devil Wears Prada"", ""Rachel Getting Married"" - since then, it's much easier to accept her as more than just another pretty face (although I do find her quite attractive). The movie itself is totally predictable, so I still hold that ""Happy Days"" is Garry Marshall's best creation. As the Fonz would say ""I knew dat!""",The Princess Diaries
7,jboothmillard,The Princess Diaries,4,13 December 2009,"I think I only decided to try this film from Disney Studios because of the cast, and might be alright for a cheap giggle, and that is exactly what it was, from director Garry Marshall (Overboard, Pretty Woman). Basically socially awkward but bright San Francisco 15-year old teenager Mia Thermopolis (debuting Anne Hathaway) raised by single mother Helen (Caroline Goodall) discovers that she is related to royalty. She can't believe that she is the daughter of the deceased Prince of Genovia, with his wife Queen Clarisse Renaldi (Dame Julie Andrews) as Grandmother, who tells her she has to decide whether or not to take his place. For a while Mia tries to live normally with this revelation being secret, even after being primped up, but she is being stalked by the press when the truth is blurted out. It looks like she is convinced of saying no, but changes her mind after reading a letter from her father, and she is a real princess by the end. Also starring Hector Elizondo as Joe, Heather Matarazzo as Lilly Moscovitz, Mandy Moore as Lana Thomas, Robert Schwartzman as Michael Moscovitz, Escape to Witch Mountain's Erik Von Detten as Josh Bryant, Sandra Oh as Vice Principal Gupta and Larry Miller as Paolo the Hairdresser. Hathaway in her first film is quite good, Andrews brings the usual sweet-faced radiance to her role, and while it isn't the funniest family comedy you will see, it isn't too bad.

8,rmax304823,Cute.,6,4 August 2015,"Anne Hathaway makes a cute San Francisco teen age preppie. The Zeitgeist demands that she dress and act like an iconoclast. She and her friends are rowdy, rude, unkempt. Her hair looks like it was attacked by a mad dog.Then, it's discovered that she is heir to the throne of Genovia or Ruritania or Arcadia or someplace. She is visited by the queen, Julie Andrews, a warm personality who has brought innumerable consultants and factotums who are intent on turning Hathaway into the Princess she will become.The director, Garry Marshall, does a good job. He's an Italian-American and must have gotten a kick out of Larry Williams as an uncredited hair dresser and make up artist named Prego Putanesco. As he trims her up, he remarks, ""I love your eyebrows. We'll call them Frieda and Kahlo."" Now, if this were a dumb movie made only for young girls barely into their growth spurt, would a joke like that have been included? (Hint: No.) I kind of enjoyed it. Nice shots of San Francisco in winter's rain.The fairy-tale story is pretty damned hoary. (I think that's called iambic dimeter. The voices tell me to do it.) Yet the setting, the gags, and the animated performance of Anne Hathaway who has the sparkling grin of a toothpaste commercial, bring it all over the goal line.",The Princess Diaries
9,moonspinner55,"Tolerable, but underwhelming make-over comedy is undeniably 'tween proof...",5,24 September 2006,"Modern-day teenage wallflower in San Francisco finds out her estranged, deceased father was really a European prince and that she is of royal blood; her grandmother, the Queen of Genovia, arrives and gives the clumsy girl the requisite make-over, but what about the schoolboy who has a crush on her, furry eyebrows and all? Meg Cabot's book becomes Disney fodder for girls under 12. Director Garry Marshall doesn't try very hard to add any dimension or substance to the proceedings, and Anne Hathaway's nerdette is inconsistently developed (she says her main goal is to be invisible, yet she hangs out with cool, quirky kids, hopes to drive a fashionably trendy classic car, lives in a reconverted firehouse with her post-hippie mother, and ditches her eyeglasses without ever one complaint over the nuisance of contact lenses). The film is piffle, but it does have some drive for the first hour. Once the transformation is complete, the movie runs out of processed ideas and has to come up with some sort of logical ending, which it struggles with painfully. Followed by a sequel in 2004. ** from ****",The Princess Diaries
10,Quinoa1984,One of Marhall's worst films,2,6 August 2001,"Garry Marshall has made a good amount of movies that are pretty much by the book and all the charm that the movies have are either for the braindead, or even worse, the actors' families (the ones that act in the movie I mean). The Princess Diaries is certainly no exception as he makes a meticulously by the book corny fest (I had to walk out at one point and have a breather for sanity) with Hathaway playing a 15 year old (isn't she 21?  no sense huh?) who finds out that she is the princess of Genovia or some country and she has to take it over and will she be able to and, and DO I NEED To GO ON?  I think not.  Unless you have never seen a movie before, you will be knowing the entire plot of the movie while your watching it (I knew it before I even saw the trailer which is never a good sign) and it uh, uh, just sucks.  Let me put it this way, the only reason I saw this movie was because it was in theaters and I try to see all movies in theaters around me, that's all.  If this had been a straight to Disney channel movie, which it damn sure should've, I wouldn't touch it with a 10 foot pole.  A down a utterly flabergastly (if that's a word) shame, especially considering Andrews is the only person in the movie with talent.  F",The Princess Diaries

Awkward and shy she lives with her artist mother Helen (Catherine Goodall) in an refurbished former fire station. Then one day she meets her grandmother Clarisse (Julie Andrews) and is informed that she is the Princess of the European country of Genovia. Despite the perks involved, she is not so sure she wants to assume the title. Very formulaic and obviously made for children, the whole plot and production are pure Disney. Very fairy tale-like and predictable.Yet it is difficult to dislike. The main characters are not your usual irritating, bratty teens. There is an innocence to it all that propels the movie.

We know where it is heading and it never gets more entertaining than frying it under a magnifying glass in the hot sun. Director Garry Marshall can create humour and has done better and funnier films. With this film he seems to present a juvenile version of his acclaim Pretty Woman. This theme has been recycled to death through countless films, many of which are as bad as this one. Julie Andrews and Hathaway are at the mercy of recycled material and both do well with what amounts to absolutely nothing. In supporting roles are Hector Elizondo is standard as the limo driver who has that hint of wisdom. Larry Miller can be funny but here he plays a makeup consultant and totally over the top. Heather Matarazzo plays Hathaway's neglected friend. Her role is more or less to be the dopey irritating friend.

17,zetes,Surprisingly good - Anne Hathaway is going to be a huge star!,7,2 January 2002,"I was completely expecting to despise this movie. The only reason I watched more than five minutes is because I was lazy. Fortunately, it turned out to be quite good. I mean, yeah, it is sort of trite. It doesn't ask for too much. You know, be yourself kind of thing. Anne Hathaway is at first provided with hair, eyebrows, and glasses that don't make her ugly at all. In fact, when she gets her magical makeover, she's no more pretty than before. So what makes this movie good? Well, Julie Andrews, for one. It's just wonderful having her back in a movie, for God's sake. But it would be a very slight film if it weren't for Ms. Hathaway. She's a very rare breed indeed: she's Hollywood A-list material, easily one of the most beautiful faces out there. But she's also a fine actress. Her character is the typical accident-prone, romantic comedy type, but Hathaway provides her with so much character that it's difficult not to be swept off your feet. Even in scenes that were clearly terrible, she shone through. I laughed at jokes that were quite bad. Her character's growth was nothing but cliches, but she convinced me. Also of note is the excellent supporting cast: Hector Elizondo especially, but also Heather Matarazzo, so great in Welcome to the Dollhouse, and Sandra Oh, who was great in Don McKellar's film Last Night. Most people are, of course, still going to hate this movie. That's fine  there is plenty to frown upon. Young girls will very much like it. It's very harmless. The lessons taught are all valuable ones, however cliche. 7/10.",The Princess Diaries
18,Smells_Like_Cheese,"Silly and Predictable, but entertaining nevertheless",6,29 July 2007,"Last night I was just looking for a good new movie to watch and I was looking in my mom's film collection and came across The Princess Diaries, so I figured I would give it a shot. I love Julie Andrews and Anne Hathaway, so it seemed like just a fun little movie that I could watch before I fell asleep. I have to say that The Princess Diaries is a modern day fairy tale and that it is absolutely charming. It had cute laughs and is perfect for a teen audience, I could see some adults enjoying it as well. The actors were wonderful and the plot was reasonably good.Mia is an average girl in San Fransico, her goal in life though is to remain invisible by keeping her frizzy hair, bushy eyebrows, and clumsiness to push everyone away. She has a couple of friends, Lily and Michael, who genuinely care about her and her mom. But one day her long lost grandmother, Clarisse Renaldi, who is the queen of Genovia comes to tell her that she is the princess and must learn how to behave like one to rule the country. Mia takes the lessons and decides that she will find out if she wants it or not. But there comes a price when the school finds out and starts to love HER publicity a little too much.The Princess Diaries was very cute, my only problem was that it was extremely stereotypical and at times a bit too predictable. But seeing where this movie was aimed at, I'd say it did a job well done. Julie and Anne had great chemistry, they are such wonderful actresses that they really made this film enjoyable. This was a cute film, I would recommend it to others for an afternoon watch.

There's nothing here that would cause you to blush even a little bit as you watch this with your 8 year old. The strongest language used is ""shut up"" - and it was quickly explained to the Queen that in America ""shut up"" doesn't necessarily mean ""be quiet;"" it might just mean ""wow!""There's a strong cast. Hathaway put on a very good performance in the lead role of Mia, moving from shy and awkward teenager, to sudden celebrity causing her to have to deal with being popular not for who she is but for what she is, to - finally - elegant princess.

20,Robert_duder,Absolute Perfection!!,10,22 April 2002,"I have read reviews that state this movie was poorly acted. I completely disagree. This movie was never meant to be Citizen Cane...it was meant to be a Disney Adventure about a young girl who discovers she is a princess and in a few short months must look, act, and fit the part of being a Princess of a country called Genovia. The writing for this film is perfection, each character no matter how small or insignificant has so much depth and you feel for them and care for them and it's the kind of movie you want to see over and over and over again forever. It's an instant classic. The creation of Genovia without even being there or showing it is brilliant. You long to see this beautiful country and you imagine all sorts of things about it. The movie is hilariously funny without taking away from the plot of the movie or moving to stupidity rather than just being funny. Anne Hathway is perfect as misunderstood Mia who is practically invisible to everyone at school except her best friend, her best friend's brother, and her mother. She plays the part to perfection, and her physical comedy is so natural and funny. This movie is not only made to delight the younger people but adults will love it too if you truly love a decent, funny, cute movie. Julie Andrews as expected is beautiful and regal. If anyone was meant to play a Queen, it would be Andrews. The part fits her like a glove. She moves us and awes us the way a Queen actually would. Everyone in the film plays a part and without any one of them it wouldn't be the same spectacular movie. This movie will stay in my top ten films for all time.

23,filipemanuelneto,A good movie with interesting and uplifting moral messages.,8,23 December 2016,"This film revolves around the problems of succession to the throne of a fictional European micro-state called Genovia, which was probably inspired by Andorra and Monaco, I guess. The country has been ruled by the Renaldi (almost Grimaldi) dynasty but the succession now depends on an American teenager, who does not know that she is a princess and was not raised for such.The plot has been well thought out and has lots of fun situations. Obviously, a situation like that of the movie (a princess who does not know that is a princess) is impossible. They know that they are royals, even if they live in anonymity (very common in countries that were monarchies but they ceased to be, such Portugal or France). But its still humorous, and the way the situation is explained is almost convincing. Almost because I don't understand how Mia never discovered her true blood before her grandmother came to visit her. That seems quite illogical for me, but... The film puts emphasis on some things that correspond to real life. One of them is the need to prepare the future king, giving him the education and training indispensable to the position he will have. Mia makes a tremendous effort to learn, with successive mistakes that delight the public. Its to die for laughing but it also shows how difficult and demanding it really is. Another point that I saw and corresponds to real life is the public examination that is currently subject to the royal families through the mass media. If a king takes a false step, however small, this step is inflated by the media and quickly creates a crisis. But the central message of the film lies in never forgetting our origins, or the people who were part of our life before we reached the pinnacle. This morally edifying message lacks to many so-called ""plebeians"" who, attaining fame or fortune, soon forget where they came from.This is, I think, the work that pushed Anne Hathaway on the path of fame, and justly. The actress showed talent and ability to explore the psychological dilemmas of her character. Julie Andrews also looked good in the role of queen, though she did not explore much of that division between the public figure and what she is in private. It would make her character more interesting. Hector Elizondo plays a curious part, I never realized what he really is. Driver? Security chief? Chief of Staff? Queen's lover? All mixed up? The support cast also did not look bad. The jokes were very well thought out and were well framed in the film.This is a good example of what I call ""fairytale movies"". But, unlike other films where anyone can be a prince, Mia has always been a princess by right, she just didn't know it. The funny about this film is the teenager's difficulties in dealing with it. It's a good movie for the whole family, with good jokes and interesting moral messages.",The Princess Diaries

I'm much the same today, so I had not seen either of the Princess Diary movies until someone (who does not know me at all) gave me the PD2 on DVD. So now, I own one of them. I really didn't have a choice after that. I'm kinda stuck in my ways, and I just won't watch 2 without having seen 1 first, so I rented the first, watched it and then watched 2.This was a great movie! It was sweet, and tender where it should have been, and serious in all the appropriate places. Capped off with stellar performances and Julie Andrews (!!), what was not to love?Though this is far from my typical fare, it was a very entertaining and memorable experience.It rates a 7.8/10 from...the Fiend :.",The Princess Diaries
26,ebiros2,Ann Hathaway in her defining role,6,20 December 2012,"Many people don't like ""Fluff"" movies like this. I can tell, because I get negative reviews whenever I write good things about these types of movies. But I think secretly, even some macho men likes these movies. I personally don't care because if it's a good movie, then it's a good movie whatever the genre is. If there's one word to describe this movie, it's Ann Hathaway. All the movie's goodness owes to her. She's convincing as a princess, and she really is an interesting character in this movie. My eyes were pretty much glued to her all through the movie. Much like Julie Andrews attracted attention when she was younger in ""The Sound of Music"", she carries the movie with her presence. Julie Andrews by the way also appears in a supporting role in this film.The movie definitely made Ann Hathaway a star. She's probably deserving, because she still has nice presence in a more recent movies like the Dark Knight Rising.In any case, this is a good movie, and is definitely worth the watch.",The Princess Diaries
27,r96sk,Just about a good film,7,12 October 2020,"It goes on for a bit too long, but 'The Princess Diaries' is just about a good film.Anne Hathaway (Mia) is the star no doubt, she's the only character I'll likely remember from this 2001 production. Julie Andrews (Clarisse) is decent too, while Héctor Elizondo (Joe) is extremely likeable in his role. There's also a (incredibly) small appearance from 'The Walking Dead' alum Karl Makinen.I found the plot a little tedious to watch in parts, not helped by a few cringey gags. I also, in live-action/non-fantasy films, always find it difficult to believe in fictional places - in this case ""Genovia"". It's a small gripe of mine. Anyway, I do of course appreciate and rate the overall message of the film.Overall, when all is said and done, I did narrowly enjoy watching this. The main reason being Hathaway, but also the moral of the story.",The Princess Diaries
28,Catherine_Grace_Zeh,One of the most romantic Disney movies I have ever seen!,9,27 July 2006,"Even though I've never read the book, THE PRINCESS DIARIES, in my opinion, is one of the most romantic Disney movies I have ever seen. If you ask me, Michael Nyman's score was absolutely romantic. In addition, I thought that the performances were superior, the directing was excellent, the costumes were perfectly designed, and the casting was perfect. Also, when Mia (Anne Hathaway) got hazed, I felt really sorry for her. You poor thing. When she fell for Josh (Erik von Detten), I got all warm and tingly inside. In addition, when Lana (Mandy Moore) got coned, I felt really good. Kudos to Garry Marshall and everyone involved for a job well done. Now, in conclusion, if you are a fan of Julie Andrews or Anen Hathaway, or you enjoyed Meg Cabot's title novel, I highly recommend this movie. You're in for a feel good time, so see this movie today.

They got many things right with this movie, a lot more was right then was wrong. The main thing that was just perfect was the casting. Anne Hathaway did a great job with her breakthrough starring role. She holds her own and has enough acting ability to make us care about her and her life. This includes her relationships, both romantic and family. And of course Julie Andrews is just perfect as the grandmother and Queen. She is a veteran actress that we all know from the sound of music and Mary Poppins, and she really proves she's still got what it takes. Mandy Moore is good as the high school b***h, and Heather Matarazzo is funny and delightful as ever in the best friend role. The writing is good, it brings out the movies heart and highlights the chemistry between the characters. It's great for a family viewing.... but I think that just about anyone can enjoy this film. 8/10 for The Princess Diaries.",The Princess Diaries
30,Boyo-2,The worse little girls movie of 1966,2,1 July 2002,"Ugh, this was bad. Garry Marshall is losing the ability to make watchable movies.  I never confused him with William Wellman or Hitchcock, but they were at least entertaining on some levels.  This is just an exercise in cuteness that does not wear well at all. I really do not want to critcize this movie because I am glad that movies like this get made.  By 'like this' I mean encouraging movies for kids that are not strewn with lousy attitudes by shower-deprived actors who act like they are 37 already.  But the first rule is to make the movie good!  Anne Hathaway is a put-upon geekette who hangs around with Heather Matarazzo, who has made a career playing those characters.  It must have been agony for Heather to watch another actress play her part, but this is still Disney, after all, and still Julie Andrews.  Inexplicably she is never told she is royalty and gets angry at her hippie mom for not telling her the truth and for Granny Julie for staying out of her life.  See, now she has to rule Genovia, which hopefully has better screenwriters than we here in the States. Princess aspect kicks in at the last minute. The movie is cruel at times to Anne, even after her title is discovered, and you want to get as much mileage out of that as possible.  Larry Miller, Sandra Oh and obviously Hector Elizondo are around to ease the pain, while Julie Andrews is not exactly magical, its still very nice to see her.  I've been watching that woman on screen for over thirty years now..I think Anne Hathaway is very talented and I hope she gets better offers from this - at least it would have served that purpose.
Sorry, this one is a loser. And there is no DIARY!  2/10.",The Princess Diaries

Making up a country for this also feels like a special sub-trope.What I'm sure is a trope is the ""She's All That"" where you have a clumsy, homely girl that you turn into a beautiful, graceful desirable.The fun of cultures clashing between America and ""Genovia"" is fun, and a family reuniting is touching, but all the high school girl drama, all the flavors, is overdone and boring. I understand it is needed to develop Mia as a character with which we empathize, but there have to be better ways to establish a character. Unfortunately, we would lose quite a lot by speeding it up, so I get it.While this movie doesn't do much special, it's equally good from start to finish, and reliably so.",The Princess Diaries
32,philip_vanderveken,Disney's candy factory working full throttle again,5,21 December 2004,"It's sometimes unbelievable if you see what kind of movies are made in the Disney Studio's. Sometimes I really believe old Walt has missed the chance of his lifetime by not starting a candy factory. I'm sure he would have done great...The Princess Diaries is about an ordinary girl who's biggest ambition is to go through life without being noticed and she is succeeding perfectly. On one fine day however she get's to hear that she's really a princess and the future queen of a small kingdom somewhere between France and Spain. Normally that little country would be called Andorra, but that's not really a cool name, is it? So why not change it to Genovia? Who would notice? Certainly not the Americans, they don't know anything about Europe, so why would they know anything about a small country in Europe? Of course her head starts to spin as she is getting prepared to become a real princess. She almost forgets her friends. She no longer cares about the boy that loves her anymore and tries to get a prettier boyfriend. But of course in the end she realizes that what she is doing is all wrong and she becomes some kind of modern version of a fairy tale princess...This movie is just childish, very unbelievable and full of stereotypes. I guess it is perfect for teenage girls who dream about becoming a princess and need this kind of modern fairy tales to escape the hard reality that life is... The only problem is that I'm not a teenage girl, I can see past all that sugar sweet nonsense. Even though I didn't really like the movie, I have to admit that it had some good things too. From time to time I was able to smile because of some ""jokes"". It will never be my favorite movie, but I still give it a 5/10 because of that.",The Princess Diaries

34,mattymatt4ever,"Watchable, mildly amusing and a film you can't hate; but overall dissatisfying",5,14 August 2001,"I know what you're all thinking.  It's a G-rated comedy.  What do you expect?  Well, after seeing ""Shrek"" and ""Osmosis Jones"" I've realized something many people seem to overlook:  ""It IS possible to make a good-natured, clean family movie that satisfies adults and kids alike!""
""The Princess Diaries"" is a pleasant family flick that I can't say I hated. It's watchable, it's mildly amusing.  Even captivating, in a most lightweight sense.  But the humor is often flat and predictable, and delivered in a forced manner.  The characters are treated like plot points. The plot is as predictable as night and day.I'm not expecting subtlety, darn it!  I understand this is supposed to be a lightweight family film, but so was ""Shrek""!  So was ""Osmosis Jones""!  But I received a ton of laughs out of those films.  I only got intermittent chuckles out of ""PD.""  It's like the writers felt, ""Heck, I can't put any scatological humor in this, so I may as well try to muster whatever I can out of a G-rated comedy by lowering our standards totally and creating jokes so cheap only five-year-olds will find this funny.""  And of course only a five-year-old girl can be fascinated by the completely by-the-numbers storyline, which scoops up every possible fairy tale and love story cliche to the last predictable note.  In the spirit of films like ""She's All That"" we're introduced to a supposedly nerdy female character who looks very attractive in the first place, yet everyone looks at her like she's an ogre. Only ""She's All That"" had a good deal of humor and charm to make up for it. This movie is fueled solely by obvious plot points.Anne Hathaway, though extremely beautiful, is phony in her performance. She never convinces us that she is in fact this nebbish fifteen-year-old girl and her performance is way over-the-top.  It's nice to see Julie Andrews grace the screen after all these years.  That was a treat.  Though she has to work with a low-level script, she holds her own and keeps the charm on full blast.  She's just as great as she was in ""The Sound of Music"" and ""Mary Poppins.""  Hector Elizondo (a Garry Marshall regular) also gives us another impressive performance.  He's another one of the film's saving graces.  He says a funny one-liner--the one subtle homosexual reference in the film:  (holding a box of high-heel women's shoes) ""Shopping in San Francisco, the salesperson asked if I want them wrapped or do I want to wear them out of the store?""  Also to help spice things up is the great Larry Miller, who steals the show in practically every supporting role he's in. He plays a flambouyant Italian fashion expert, who gives Mia (Hathaway) the big makeover.The plot has everything we've seen in the past teen-bopper flicks, only sanitized and more dumbed-down in a G-rated fashion.  We have Hathaway as the nerd, Heather Matarazzo as the nerdy best friend, the popular girl in the school/cheerleader (Mandy Moore) who is hot and looks down upon every other girl because she's so hot and all the fellow students view her as a goddess (yet everyone in the audience hates her guts--isn't that ironic?), we have the hot Backstreet Boys wannabe who also happens to be as subtle as a fire hydrant--not to mention a complete jerk--yet the main character has a huge crush on him and we have Matarazzo's brother as the guy who's always had the hots for Mia and also happens to be a complete outcast--despite the fact that he's also dashingly handsome.  I would go into the whole plot, but after I just introduced you to all the cardboard characters, you probably would've guessed the whole darn thing by now.""The Princess Diaries"" is somewhat of a guilty pleasure.  Despite its outburst of cliches, it's a pleasant and happy journey.  And quite frankly this could've been as nauseating as an amateurish teen comedy like ""All I Wanna Do"" if it wasn't handled by Garry Marshall.  OK, this is not strictly a teen comedy, but most of the action revolves around teens.  Marshall was desperate to direct a movie that his children can enjoy, since ""Pretty Woman"" and ""Runaway Bride"" aren't films designated for the twelve and under crowd.  So if Marshall's raw ambition wasn't put into this work, I perfectly understand.  If you have young children, they'll love this movie!  They'll eat it up with a spoon!  And though I enjoyed it to a degree and you can--in some aspects--say it's fitfully entertaining, but older audiences still won't find ""PD"" ultimately satisfying.  As I said, I've seen ""Shrek"" and ""Osmosis Jones,"" and to tell you the truth I think adults will enjoy those movies MORE than children, though that is the target audience.  So I don't want to hear any crappy responses like, ""Hey!  It's a kid's movie!  What do you expect?""  Go see the two movies I just mentioned.  THAT'S what I expect! Family comedy doesn't entirely translate to:  ""Lower your standards.""My score:  5 (out of 10)",The Princess Diaries
35,CitizenCaine,Hathaway and Andrews Shine In Otherwise Routine Film,6,8 July 2005,"Garry Marshall's brand of humor is sometimes hit or miss and in The Princess Diaries, it's a miss. Anne Hathaway stars as an ugly duckling with self confidence difficulties, who supposedly is the heir to some imaginary country wedged between France and Spain I think. The Princess Diaries is full of stock, formulaic situations which are resolved in predictable fashion before the fadeout. The movie is saved by the charming presence of Anne Hathaway, Julie Andrews, and a host of good supporting actors. Andrews plays Queen Clarisse Renaldi of the imaginary Genovia. Her right hand man Joe is Hector Elizondo. Whenever the two of them are on screen, they lift the movie above the ordinary. Heather Matarazzo plays Hathaway's nerdy friend Lily Moscovitz. The interplay between the two is genuine enough for us to believe that they're really friends. Mandy Moore and Sandra Oh appear in the movie in small roles. Marshall sets up a number of situations in the movie, but then he fails to deliver. The ""scandal"" in the film is an absolute joke and really makes little logical sense. The film is routine in its execution and since it's rated G, it's really only for the tween set. ** of 4 stars.",The Princess Diaries

First Leelee Sobieski became Helen Hunt's `chip off the old block and now we have Anne Hathaway subbing for Julia Roberts.  Besides Hathaway's remarkable resemblance to Roberts, her on screen personna is a virtual copy, though Hathaway gives it a fresh take and is, if possible, more winsome and winning than Roberts.  Hathaway has a real future, should she pursue it, at the very time Roberts career will likely take a different turn.Garry Marshall's `The Princess Diaries' is, in many ways, a G-Rated remake of `Pretty Woman;' though it's `fish out of water' theme is universal.  An adorable cast, headed by Hathaway, Julie Andrews and Hector Elizondo gives this movie the perfect combination of  charm, humor and romance.  This is the perfect movie for the whole family.  Preteens will enjoy the physical humor; adolescents the attractive young people discreetly on display and a story to which they can personally relate; adults the wry, suggestive, but not smutty dialogue and the elderly the return to romance among both `young' and `old.'There's nothing offensive in `The Princess Diaries' and much to recommend it.

37,FilmOtaku,Cute Fairy Tale,4,10 May 2003,"I'll preface this by saying that it was late night and a choice between Cheers reruns, paid programming or this movie, so I chose this.  Having said that, I actually don't regret my decision as much as I thought I would.The Princess Diaries is a modern day fairy tale about Mia (Hathaway) who lives in San Francisco with her divorced mother.  One day, her estranged grandmother (Andrews) comes to visit with a proposal for her:  She would like Mia to be her successor and become Princess of Genovia.  Hilarity ensues because Mia is pretty much a regular teen who is clumsy, awkward and in desperate need of a professional makeover, so she spends the next several weeks in etiquette lessons, getting ""re-done"" and trying to decide if being a princess is what she really wants in life. The film was cute, at times extremely corny, but watcheable.  It featured surprisingly decent acting by Hathaway, who made up for the horrible Mandy Moore.  I especially enjoyed Hector Elizondo, a good character actor who was kind of hilarious doing his best Shaft impersonation as the Queen's head of security.  Heather Matarazzo who was also featured as Mia's best friend, continues in her ""quirky girl"" tradition, but still can't live up to her role in Welcome to the Dollhouse.  This is one of the few ""kid's movies"" that I wouldn't hesitate to watch with a kid, because it's tolerable.

This film is definitely targeted at young girls, and it has plenty of comedy and charm to keep entertained. The film teaches girls that, deep inside, a princess is waiting to come out, and every girl has the opportunity to become a princess and become beautiful, even if she is socially-awkward and clumsy.

My childless roommate, a female, thought some of the dialogue and behavior of the title character was a bit fakey. My experience with young adolescent girls in the household was that the movie dialogue was actually right on key. Kids have a way of over-dramatizing things, and a penchant for making even the most ordinary situations theatrical and melodramatic. ""The Princess Diaries"" certainly seemed to capture that.The thing is, what truly interests and occupies a 13 or 14 year-old girl is NOT what interests anybody else. Thus, the movie comes off as kind of stale, lame, and way too low key. In our house, we gamely tried to get in the spirit and enjoy what the movie could offer us. Sadly, that wasn't much, and we ultimately gave up and quit watching before the end. Within 4 or 5 seconds we had forgotten that we had even been watching it.But for the kids-- it seems wholesome and authentic, and possibly just the thing for those angsty early adolescent theater queens.

Anne Hathaway plays Mia, and of course, Julie Andrews, do the best they can. They are troopers with a so-so script that really keeps its focus on the teen trauma, that IS adolescence. Unfortunately, adults will become rather distracted and start counting the lonely minutes, as the film wears on. The script tends to really drag, laden with the usual provisos that require more than a few dull-witted adults, hip kids, et al. Worse yet, the script aims at the adolescent thought zone and stay there, making it way too cute to suspend a gram of belief. Throw in the fact grandma is the head of state of a country, and knowing her name and being totally oblivious to this fact, is a serious stretch.
Julie Andrews comes as close to anyone, to being the antagonist of the film. I'm sorry, but the mere thought of Julie Andrews being nasty or even rude to anyone, could bring down the republic. She is a goddess of musical entertainment, and we would still worship her anyway. The real standout of this pic is Hector Elizondo, who is believable, likeable and charismatic, as Joe. The scenes between him and Julie are some of the best. THE PRINCESS DIARIES is not one of the best, but it's not the worst, by far.

52,jackjack-2,Very slow and unrealistic drama,5,6 August 2001,This movie develops so slowly and it is so predictable that it is hard to keep awake. Poor casting. Why cast an older woman to play a teenager?Julie Andrews should have stayed retired. She was great in musicals but she has never cut it in dramas and she doesn't cut it in this one.,The Princess Diaries
53,bjones,Fun and entertaining,8,12 August 2001,"I went to see this film with my wife. We both thought it looked entertaining at least. I was very pleasantly surprised to find it was a very well made, heartwarming film. It isn't high art but it doesn't pretend to be. Although some have said it gives mixed messages about person worth and value, it still manages to remain more positive than not. I think far too much emphasis is placed on the importance of films as social commentary and instruction.The first criteria are, as always, does it entertain. This fine film from Garry Marshall does just that. Anne Hathaway is wonderful in her role as the title character. I really enjoyed her all to short run in the TV series ""Get Real"" and I am glad to see she will continue to be around. With her obvious talent, charm and beauty she is an actress that should be around for a very long time. Julie Andrews added the perfect counterpoint to Hathaway's klutzy teenager. She is beautiful and elegant as always. Hector Elizondo did a great job with his character, with the just the right subtlety. The appearance of the singer Mandy Moore in a film probably aimed at young people is not a surprise, what was refreshing was the avoidance of the obvious type of role these performers get. She was cast as a heavy, Hathaway's nemesis and a cliche but all too true cliquish cheerleader.Anyone out looking for an enjoyable trip to the theater can't go too far wrong with this.",The Princess Diaries

55,CKCSWHFFAN,Enjoyable film,7,5 September 2008,"I enjoy both of the films. Enjoyable but not perfect films. The reason I saw both in the first place was to watch Julie's performance. She is perfect in her role as Queen Clarisse Renaldi.Hector Elizondo was also god in his Joseph/Joe role in both films.I hated Larry Miller's character. It was SUPPOSED TO BE FUNNY. I found it hurtful & rude.This special edition is good. You have both the wide screen & full screen viewing options.Extras good. Outtakes, deleted scenes good. The ""A New Princess"" on disc 2, the ""making of"" special was good as well BUT MISSING 1 THING. WHERE THE HECK WAS HECTOR ELIZONDO? A staple in Garry?s films, why was he not spoken to?

56,smashattack,The popular decision...,6,21 October 2002,"I was impressed with The Princess Diaries, and not because of its plot, its story line, its actors, its characters, or even its music.  No, I really liked it for its issues concerning popularity and just how dangerous it can be.The Princess Diaries does have a nice plot, story line, actors, character, and music.  But it is a great role model for children, showing them that the popular thing isn't always the way to go.  Mia's encounters with Josh and the cheerleaders is a perfect example of why popularity is not always cool.As for the plot, its decent, but could use a little flavoring.  It's kind of corny that she is a princess (the title is probably the most corny part of the movie), but the story flows along smoothly.  The comedy is great and the irony is remarkable.  I enjoyed the constant predicaments Mia had to work her way out of (or into), including the press.The actors are all good, and I was impressed by Anne Hathaway.  If I'm not mistaken, this is her first acting job.  Forgive me if I'm wrong, I was told this.  But if it is, she did excellently.  She's also a really pretty young girl, and it's a nice transformation in the movie, showing that anybody can become beautiful if they try.All in all, The Princess Diaries is quite a good movie and I would recommend seeing it.  Don't let the cover and the title steer you from seeing this movie; it's really good.",The Princess Diaries
57,mrskywalker,Wonderful Movie,10,5 September 2001,Princess diaries is a wonderful movie.  Anne Hathaway is very funny as the possible princess and should be starring in many more movies.  This is a tale of a teenage girl who must make a decision as to whether or not to accept an offer to become a princess of a foreign land or stay in her current life as an American high school student.  It plays very much as a story and not as a rock video.  it is not a parody and is not seeking to make teenagers look sleazy and moronic such as in American Pie films.  It is more related to the film Legally Blonde and if you liked Legally Blonde you will probably like this film.It shows a wide range of personalities and is a film of wonder and excitement.  It is also a film for all ages from 6 to 90.  It is also wonderful to see that Julie Andrews still looks and acts so well.  The supporting cast is excellent.,The Princess Diaries

59,poem,Heather is back !,1,3 January 2002,"Sometimes women act so well I could just marry them immediately for that. Well, after her wonderful part in Strike! - she was definitely even better than Kirsten Dunst or any other of the teenage casts there - I never saw any other movie of Heather Matarazzo. Now here she is back again, and I was surely happy about seeing her again !However, the movie itself failed completely.Well, no question, there was a good cast, good acting, very nice background. Especially, I liked Heathers part (closest friend of the princess) and the queen, and the funny house the princess lives in. Camera and directing itself wasn't bad, either. And about that Mandy Moore - she was just as evil and stupid as her character should have been, I don't know what else people expected from her.But the story itself was narrated in such an unbelievable boring and lifeless way ! The characters showed nearly no development and appeared lifeless in an unnatural degree. The storyline offered no surprise whatsoever and always took the most obvious way.Interesting smaller roles occur sometimes but offered no surprise either. For example, the neighbor of the princess, I always expected that something will happen with him, but he just stays a little weird, with no further characterization.Or the other pupils in school. They just stay the same throughout the whole movie ! Any REAL girl who would switch to such an attractive outfit would get masses of attention from boys. But again, the other pupils just stay lifeless around and treat her nearly as if nothing has really changed. That was so unnatural !Same with the princess. Her behavior was so damned predictable all the time.In short, the writer of the script absolutely had no clue about real people, and made most, if not all characters appear flat and super-stereotype. Many parts of the script also smelled like an old man's phantasy.There where still some nice little jokes in the script, for example when the princess should give an address to her school class, or how she damaged some statue. As such, the movie wasn't really pain to watch - but I didn't felt very well entertained either.Strike! was a masterpiece, I liked it even more than Matrix, but this one here is just plain boring. I hope I get the chance to see a better one with Heather soon !",The Princess Diaries

My masochistic instinct and my movie hunger together push me to go on making something so bad to myself and so I watched also this atrocious Princess Diary. This is a movie made for girl 5-12 years old and mentally postponed. Never in my life I have been seeing something so stupid and so boring. Evidently there is a new category of moviegoers made with some ignorant and stupid kind of girls not used until now to go to the movietheater.

62,TheArgentWolf,Book vs Movie - Book wins.,8,16 May 2005,"Okay, I will not deny that the movie was brilliant, because it was - but what ruined the movie for me was reading the books. The books are much better, with a deeper plot line, and the movie had very little of the original aspects, which upset me. Where was Tina? Where was Boris? They were all key characters in the book, and there's no reason they shouldn't have been carried off into the movie. But anyway.Anne Hathaway is a brilliant actress in any movie she does, except for the fact most of her movies are the same, but that's beside the point. She's perfect for the part. I also liked Heather Matarazzo as Lilly, and I'm glad they were both in the second movie. Julie Andrews was wonderful to, and it's nice to see that after all these years, she can still play a strong, and good character. A character and actor I didn't like though, was Jeremiah Hart, played by Patrick Flueger. If he was supposed to be a replacement for Boris, he was a very weak replacement. The character could have been a bit more similar to his equal in the books, and the acting could have been better.For a Disney movie, this is quite good, but in regards to linking to the book - it was done very very badly.",The Princess Diaries

She has great comic delivery, both verbal and physical.  And Hector Elizondo plays his part to perfection, as always.

I didn't fall asleep mind you (due to the numerous little girls in the audience laughing almost every 2 minutes) but I wasn't far from doing so. This is an okay movie, it was obviously not meant to be an Oscar winner, but it's nothing very fresh either. Julie Andrews does what she can as a queen who has come to talk to her grand-daughter Mia (Anne Hathaway, in her first role) about taking over the thrown as princess of a small European country. Mia is, of course, shocked but eventually does agree to take princess lessons and then the predictability really comes full circle. The jokes and laughs can be seen coming from at least five miles away and the outcome is so obvious it seems that no real effort was made at anything but a predictable one.
Again, this is an okay movie (and that's being generous in my opinion) that should please little girls and maybe teens, but young adults (like me) and adults will likely be checking their watches or lulling off into a slumber.I give it ** out of 4 stars.",The Princess Diaries

Anyway this movie is made for all ages- younger kids will think it is a funny Disney movie and will like it because it has pop princess Mandy Moore in it, teenagers will like it for the charming actors and the high school scene and adults will like it because it is a movie that they can see w/ their kids were they don't have to worry about scenes w/ sex, drugs, language, or violence.

However, unlike King Ralph, this one has the newly discovered royal as a high school girl who it not very popular.  The comedic scenes that follow are great as this student struggles to find out who she is since she has discovered she is now, which proves difficult since she now must get involved in the world of the aristocracy. 
The acting by Julie Andrews and Anne Hathaway is first rate and really makes the film enjoyable.  The plot is a little predictable but the Director, Gerry Marshal, did a great job with that short coming with some good dialog.

I'm a teenage male, and I absolutely love this film. Which must mean there's something special about it.Well, let's see. Anne Hathaway and Julie Andrews do an amazingly wonderful job acting in this movie. I have never seen better grandmother-grandchild chemistry on screen. It is absolutely enthralling and enchanting, watching them.The storyline is also very pleasing. An awkward high school girl suddenly learns she is a princess. Of course, in the movie it is actually much better than I just made it sound. Mia's transition from normality to royalty is very engaging to watch.And, unlike the sequel, you can relate to Mia in this movie because, when you look past all this princess business, she's really just an average teenager who's worried that she won't make a difference in the world.On an entirely unrelated note, I actually sort of like Mia's hair before her makeover. True, Anne Hathaway's hair looks better when it's straight, but I found the frizzy hair quite endearing. Must be a turn-on for me. . .But seriously, you must absolutely watch this movie. Everyone involved with it has done an excellent job in making us want to watch (and rewatch) this modern fairy tale. Don't miss it.",The Princess Diaries
75,chrisbishop5000,"I hear that a lot of people don't like it, they must be crazy!",8,10 July 2006,"A very modern, comical follow-up to ""My Fair Lady"". Lots of reviewers and critics are not happy with what they see in ""The Princess Diaries"" what I say is ""what's wrong with it?"". I'll agree that there is hardly any action or violence in it but isn't it about time that movies these days ought to be softened up a bit? ""Pirates of the Carabian"" and the ""Lord of the Rings Trilogy"" were successful and they are disturbingly violent and rather grim. This film is very easy-going. The story is simple, Mia (Anne Hathaway) is a self-conscious teenager who wants to lead a quiet, happy life but when her abrupt grandmother (Julie Andrews) travels from Europe to America to tell her that she is a princess of a large country. Mia is totally shocked and her grandmother expects her to be calm and think nothing of it - how harsh is that? Mia's warmhearted mother makes a compromise that she would attend princess-lessons and if she really doesn't want to accept becoming a princess then she doesn't have to. The Queen still isn't impressed but this helps Mia feel better about attending Princess-lessons and reluctantly does so. Being an all-American, rather an affected-by-hormones kind of girl things don't go to plan especially when Mia thinks she has won the affections of a teen-aged boy she is sexually attracted to who goes to her school but she doesn't know that she is being used in order for him to become famous. The Queen is very angry about how much she let the royal family down. Mia tries to explain that she didn't do it deliberately but the Queen won't listen. A few days later the Queen comes to Mia's house and apologises. The night the grand ball takes place for Mia's speech, her heart is telling her that being a princess would be the right thing and so she announces to everyone at the ball that she will be the new princess of the European country. Now hearing the story I've briefly explained, how is that rubbish? It's interesting, fun, romantic, extremely funny, heartwarming and all it has missing is the violent action and horror audiences today expect from a good movie, and to me that is a very good thing. I advise you to give it a go - you might be surprised.",The Princess Diaries

If ever the need arises to air out the brain and heart a bit and just lay back and let something flow over you that will graze you not. Here it is. This is the sort of movie that is hard to hate. It is cute, the acting is usually all right, the plot does not require any though process at all, unless you are sick with the obvious and are trying to complicate it within your mind. There are some snicker moments, but nothing to really laugh your head off, so your tummy is safe from hurting. All in all a very, very safe movie that leads to a very safe obvious ending. One word comes to mind; mediocre. Still, the mediocre has its points. It is safe, nothing like those risqué love it/ hate it movies that often are opposite of the mediocre label. Overall, not the best, not the worst movie of it's sort, very obvious, somewhat enjoyable, and extremely forgettable.

81,polar24,A fun and bubbly rom-com that took me back to my memorable teen years,7,20 February 2007,"This entertaining and hip teen comedy was a surprise winner for me. Definitely not part of the target audience (though I do consider myself young at heart!) I was charmed by Ms Hathaway's naivety and photogenic presence and the always reliable Julie Andrews who wonderfully never takes herself too seriously, poking fun at her family-friendly screen persona. Garry Marshall demonstrates his talents of sweet irresistible romantic comedies in what could be called his follow-up to his 1990 smash ""Pretty Young Woman"". And with Hathaway, he has found his 21st century young muse.The storyline fits perfectly into the soapsud daydreams of all young ladies. Never the popular kid graced with mawkish looks and a geeky personality, Mia Thermopolis resigns herself to a life of miserable loneliness and school bullies. However, in a moment of emancipation, she is uncovered by her Grandmother Clarisse Renaldi and when told that she is the last remaining bloodline of a royal family, she must take over the throne of the idealistic kingdom of Genovia. Cue Cinderella-like transformation and plenty of vivacious trying on of clothes and groovy pop tunes.The film has a simple but great (even hackneyed) message at heart, to be true to yourself and never forget that your friends and family can be the most honest and important in your life. It could have come off contrived and cheesy but the film still conveys heartwarming moments and a sincere semblance.There is great energy in the film and some of the scenes in the palace and garden are quite picturesque and dreamy. The storyline can be pretty thin considering the good-guy-bad-guy syndrome but Mia's closest friends are still commendable and mature young people capturing the trials and tribulations of teenage ""fitting in"", first loves, peer pressure, pressure from Mums and Dads and realisation of adult responsibilities.I had a really fun time with this film, absorbed in it's fairytale story lines and taking myself back to when I was young and naive. Thanks to the irresistible company and chemistry of the two female leads I was able to totally identify with their dilemmas. This film has Disney written all over it. A good simple message at heart and fully of quirky side characters and a charismatic underdog. Lovely to look at and listen to (I went out afterwards to check out the soundtrack!), this one always brings a smile to my face whenever I catch it on TV - I had a good time.",The Princess Diaries

83,OldRose,Absolutely Class...!,8,15 October 2001,"The long, long overdue return of Julie Andrews to major motion pictures could not have happened in a better setting or with a better producer. An Icon who helped make Walt Disney Pictures something more than a bastion for animated specials (not that these haven't been wonderful, consistently avant-garde, and unforgetable), we have the Lady back once more in the role of a mentor -- and she does this so well -- this time not for a proper British household, nor for a large family on the brink of the impact of a world war, but this time for a young girl who simply dares to dream. And daring to dream is something we ALL need to do.Anne Hathaway is an outstanding find and I hope we see more of her; it took a lot to encapsulate essentially two personas for a newcomer. She was equally successful at both and the results are no less than noteworthy. The audience is kept entertained throughout the film, truly a feel-good adventure in a time when the world most needed one, and excellently supported by Hector Elizondo, Heather Matarazzo, Robert Schwartzman, and a surprise cameo by ... (go and see the film to find out !!!).Not since ""Victor Victoria"" has Julie Andrews thrilled audiences like this, and said film garnered her third ocsar nomination along with a basket-full of others (6 more). That was 19 very long years ago.Treat yourself to a fabulous performance by a Veteran and Living Legend, a thrilling newcomer, a wonderful story and chance to feel good. The film's only draw-back, although it was pulled into the humour effectively, was the ""dialect"" of the city in which the story takes place.  But don't let this stop you. Rating is 4 stars (on 5).

One of the reasons why I love it is because of it's fun. This movie throughly did not fail at having the entertainment factor. Everything the plot, the characters, made it the perfect Princess movie to date.Anne Hathaway did a sensational job. In the movie, you can easily see how she progresses and builds confidence in her role. She delivered something entertaining to the audience, which is obviously great.Julie Andrews is brilliant as usual. We've seen her in titles such as The Sound of Music, Mary Poppins and even Shrek and it was wonderful to see her in this movie. She was the perfect choice for her role and I think she was the heart of the movie.As I have said, what makes this the perfect princess movie is the fun factor. This mainly focuses on the jokes, which is part of what delivers in the entertainment. There were some really funny ones such as Mia's reaction to her being a princess and the royal dinner with all the posh people. But also, this film has this light-hearted feel to it which is one of the reasons why I love it so much and one of the reasons why it makes me smile.Overall, this movie (I can't believe I'm saying this!) is by far the best Princess movie I have ever seen. I know it's a bit cheesy but like I said, it is simply delightful and it delivers. By the way, I have heard that today is IMDb's 19th Birthday I would just like to say, congratulations to everyone, that's IMDb staff and all for marking the 19th anniversary of this successful website and it's been a pleasure writing all my reviews on here.",The Princess Diaries

Now that I'm older, I can understand more, and I've read the books, and although the movie is not anything like the books, I still love them both. Also, I've started listening to Mandy Moore's music (Mandy Moore played Lana in the movie). I found her song ""Stupid Cupid"" on limewire, which was in the movie. When I was little, I liked the song, but I didn't have it on a disk or anything, so I would always fast forward to the part with the song in it, and rewind it over and over again to listen to it. But now that I'm older, I found ""Stupid Cupid"" on limewire, and I put it on a disk so I could listen to it whenever I wanted to without turning on the TV and all that. Six years after the movie came out, I still enjoy watching it. I got the movie on DVD, and I love to watch it when I don't have school.

86,kalendra274,Mamma Mia - what a great movie,8,31 July 2008,"Such a great movie.Disney's best chick flick ever.Mia Thermopolis (Hathaway) is a shy, unpopular 15-year old girl and she has some big news. Her Grandmother, Clarisse Renaldi a.k.a the Queen of Genovia (Andrews) flies in to tell Mia that she is a princess because her father died recently and what Mia doesn't know that he was the Prince of Genovia. Shocked, Mia has to make of choice that will change her life forever. Eventually, she makes up her mind of being a princess and she has princess lessons and a total princess makeover. Now, Mia and her grandmother soon start to develop this bond and has a big future ahead of her full of challenges and choices.Anne Hathaway did an amazing job with her role, it was flawless and complex and she put in lots of energy to it as well. Along with Julie Andrews who was once starred in ""Mary Poppins"" and ""The Sound Of Music"" and she still delivers magic to the audience. Overall, very good performances by the cast.The plot was well-thought out and solid from beginning to end. It starts off at Modern Day San Fransico and we see a teenage girl, with glasses on daydreaming in the morning and that's when we have the build up of all the characters, then at the end, we see a beautiful girl, confident and happy about who she is. So it is very simple and also realistic as well, so well done writers.Overall, a great Disney chick flick, with fantastic performances and a fantastic plot. Also, it leaves a great message to little girls to believe in themselves. Two thumbs up for Princess Diares.",The Princess Diaries
87,astro_92,The Princess Diaries is a delightful film for people of all ages to enjoy.,10,21 July 2005,"I think that The Princess Diaries is excellent entertainment for people of all ages. This gem of a G-rated movie works well on all levels of perspective. The two leads, Julie Andrews and Anne Hathaway, give pleasing performances that are sure to captivate everybody from toddlers to senior citizens. The supporting players here are also great, but the story revolves mainly around Hathaway's character and how her life takes on a whole new meaning after she is informed that she is a real-life princess.The cast is outstanding and the story is mesmerizing. If parents are seeking terrific films for their children to view with them or their grandparents then The Princess Diaries is a surefire winner. This movie makes me incredibly happy. Andrews is astounding while Hathaway keeps us amused with her stunning performance. Both actresses, indeed, have tons of charisma. This motion picture will forever remain to be a favorite with me!",The Princess Diaries
88,adamp-6,sigh...,4,4 March 2002,"Well, we had a big snowfall this weekend, so my wife and I decided to rent some movies to pass the time... unfortunately, she really, really wanted to see ""The Princess Diaries"".A bit of back story:  about a month ago we were watching ""The Sound of Music"" when the subject of Julie Andrews movies came up.  And of course, since Miss Andrews appears in ""The Princess Diaries"", that came up, too.  My wife wanted me to go out and rent it, but I narrowly convinced her that we wouldn't have enough time to watch it.  I just let the subject drop, hoping she'd forget about it.  And then this cursed snowstorm hit.Anyway, back to this particular story.  We also rented ""Elmo in Grouchland"" for our 3-year-old daughter.  And after having seen both films in the same day, I can honestly say ""Elmo"" is the better picture.  And I fell asleep while watching it.Yes, sleep is definitely preferable to viewing ""The Princess Diaries"".  The only thing that redeems this movie is the fact that Julie Andrews and Hector Elizondo are in it.  But if you're subjected to this movie by your ""Mary Poppins""-loving wife, just close your eyes and succumb to the bliss of sleep.  You won't miss a thing.",The Princess Diaries
89,freakezette,Go with your favorite girls,8,3 August 2001,"You know, in a summer full of heartless sequels, glitzy visuals, and movies with big names but no story, it's good to see a cute, fun and enjoyable family film.We all know the story, a kind of Cinderella mixed with my Fair Lady. Mia, a geeky barly noticed Highschool girl suddenly is the Princess of a Monaco-like country. While she is in training to be a princess, she is trying to discover if she is cut out to do this, and how superfical some people are.It's not perfect, but the cast is delightful. Anne Hathaway is a great young actress. I loved her in the short lived Fox show ""Get Real"" and she is charming as the unexepected Princess. Julia Robert was great as usual and is as good as actual royalty. I even enjoyed the secondary characters, Mia's brutally honest friend Lilly and Lilly's strange but sweet brother Michael. Even Mandy Moore and Erik Von Detton are fun as the popular cheerleader and super jock everyone knew in highschool.All I can say is it ain't shakesphere, but it is a clean, cute and humorous family movie that everyone will love, especially girls.",The Princess Diaries
90,emisue02,cute and charming,8,11 April 2003,"This movie is adorable.  I went to see it the day it was released in theaters just to see Julie Andrews on the big screen-I vowed to like it no matter what, just because she was in it.  I kept my vow, but with very little effort.  I don't know what it is about this movie that makes it so cute and so rewatchable (I know that's not a word-bear with me).  I guess everything just works-Julie and Anne Hathaway and all the other performers work really well together and it's actually somewhat intelligent.  Yes, it's rated G (which I think is great anyway-go Garry Marshall for not giving into temptation!) and it's meant for young girls, but it isn't a movie that insults your intelligence.  I can't explain it, it's just a cute movie. Can't wait for the sequel.",The Princess Diaries

I'm not quite ready to introduce my little girl to such things.                                        That having been said, it was nice to see Julie Andrews in a movie, as well as the ever distinguished-looking Hector Elizondo. Anne Hathaway stars as a young girl who discovers that she is the only living descendant of the current Queen of Genovia (Julie Andrews), and must make a decision.  Shall she carry on with her normal life?  Or will she accept her duty to her country?I give this movie a 5/10",The Princess Diaries

I think that Anne Hathaway and Julie Andrews are the coolest grandaughter-grandmother couple I've ever seen - Julie Andrews being such a great actress, and Hathaway being so beautiful. Lame acting for Lana - whoever interprets her - doesn't look like a real spoilt brat - See Freaky Friday's spoilt brats for more. Anyway, cool, great movie with a superb plot - can't wait for part 2. I give it a 10. The love story between the two characters - Mia and Michael was so nice, and the line ""You saw me when I was invisible"" was sooooo cool.",The Princess Diaries

At first it seems that is a movie for children and it is something like a fairy tale. Yes I agree with the fact that the ending of this movie is a very positive one and a lot of things in our life happen in a more negative way. However, this story also includes some educational factors for all of us. Here, we see a relationship between granddaughter and grandmother. Also we see the harmonious relationships between them and their workers. All these relationships show how we all should interact with each other and that we should always be honest towards each other. There is also another part of this movie where it shows how the main character's(princess) classmates changed drastically after they found out that she is a princess. We see their fake interviews and fake friendships with her and the way she trusts them at first. However, after some time she realizes that all these actions are fake and she again continues to be friends with her old close friends, who were with her from the beginning.

But this movie is NOT one of them.First of all, it wasn't that bad. It's just that it seemed like a fun movie, but when you go see it, it doesn't quite live up to your expectations. There are not enough funny moments and the ones that are there are not that funny after three seconds. It wants to be a fairytale movie yet it's not magical enough, what with all the stuff that's supposed to make the story seem more real. It just ain't gonna work this way. I was especially disappointed by the end. There is no dramatic twist--it is way too predictable. I know you can still get cool endings even if it is so predictable you think you're the one directing it, but this movie...didn't work. And what's the deal with the nerdy guy? He is SO hot! Rent the video if you are having a boring Sunday afternoon, but expect nothing too good. Or better yet, rent ""Clueless"" or ""10 Things I Hate About You"" . Those two are so much better and funnier.",The Princess Diaries

The whole cast seems to work together quite well and the acting is not that bad in this story of a school nerd who finds out she is a princess of a small country in Europe. This movie seems to stay true enough to the book and it doesn't go too over the top. Even after Mia has gotten her makeover and everyone knows she's a princess, she isn't instantly popular and well-liked, she's still made fun of and that seems realistic, given her previous situations.

We all enjoyed it very much.  It was a nonviolent, noncussing, nonsex, humorous family movie.  I hope they keep making them.  The only criticism I have of this movie is that Disney made it.  Disney in keeping with their tradition, changed the way the book read the main character & the story.  Disney had to make the girl grow up with out a father, where in the book - the parents were not married but the father was very much a part of his daughter's life.  Disney too many times likes to make their families disfunctional.  Look at most of their movies - even their animated movies usually don't have both parents.  Mulan was the first in a long time that had both parents present.  Sorry to tell them this - but not all families are divorced or one parent families.",The Princess Diaries
107,davidsrose,"Charming, pleasantly-surprising, ugly-duckling comedy",9,18 August 2001,"Although the movie's poster by itself (let alone the trailer) pretty much tells the whole story, The Princess Diaries is a delightfully well-done retelling of the ugly-duckling/girl-transformation story. Garry Marshall has a deft hand with comedy, and this sweet-but-not-cloying, G-rated film covers enough bases so that it really IS one that the whole family will enjoy. Julie Andrews is, well, Julie Andrews. What a classy dame! She delivers everything you would expect, and more. Hector Elizondo is his usual solid self, teen singer Mandy Moore does a funny turn as the nasty queen of the ""in"" crowd, and there are strong supporting performances from Heather Matarazzo and others. But the surprise is probably Anne Hathaway, in only her second or third film, whose performance as the duckling-turned-swan is completely on the money. She is convincing as a klutzy, ill-at-ease teenager, and morphs smoothly into an Audrey Hepburn clone who is really quite stunning. Everyone in our family, from teenage girls to middle-aged Daddy, enjoyed this one.",The Princess Diaries

For grown-ups there are some laughs but few if any of the adult double entendres that abound in cartoon Disney films and serve to keep adults interested. (Only go if you are in charge of taking the kids!) Ann Hathaway is a fine actress and a real one to watch in the future, but it is very difficult to believe she is 15 once she receives her transformation (hair job) into a princess. It's nice to see Julie Andrews; she's made a few of these kid type Disney films over the years and carries herself well throughout. The scene where she knights (sort of) a traffic cop and a cable car driver is a hoot. Somewhat sentimental and family oriented, the princess comes of age and stresses the importance of her father and mother.

115,David Fick,Andrews a highlight in otherwise average film,6,12 June 2003,"THE PRINCESS DIARIES has a great premise. Mia (Anne Hathaway), a young teenage girl discovers she is a princess and has to decide whether or not to accept the throne. She attends ""princess classes"" under the tutelage of her grandmother (Julie Andrews), as well dealing with a plethora of ""normal"" teenage problems. However, the screenplay is poorly developed and does not invest enough on the changes that take place inside Mia. While things like posture and presentation are important assets, Mia's inner journey should be even more important. Anne Hathway manages to make us care about her final decision, particularly in the final third of the film. Julie Andrews as her grandmother, the queen, is a delight - absolutely charming and graceful, with a fine grasp on the responsibility she has as a royal and the lessons she learns about becoming a grandmother. Perhaps the relationship between the queen and the character Joe could have been developed more; there are a few hints that never really come to fruition.The other thing that lets this film down are the production values, which seem little better than TV quality. Indeed, the whole outing feels more like a television pilot episode or a television movie from one of those 1980s and 1990s Disney offerings like NOT QUITE HUMAN or A BRAND NEW LIFE. ""Tweenagers"" will probably enjoy this one a lot.It's a pity, as this film has the potential to be everything it claims to be: 'hilarious, hip and heartwarming'.

As long as they have just a little charm, a small point to make - even if it is fortune cookie wisdom - and some likable characters, I'll happily let myself be entertained and block out the real world for a while. But Princess Diaries has none of those redeeming features. It's blunt and heavy handed, choosing slapstick over wit, archetypes over character development, and offering a stuttering, wobbling closure (is it about finding personal courage, which you can argue the film has been about from the first scene, or is it about thinking about others which is nothing the film has given any attention to but that is what the final speech is about?).Up from one to two stars for the decent cast, who do what they can with what they're given.",The Princess Diaries

It was predictable and consistent and could have used a plot twist here and there , there should have been a bit of intrigue after all it is about a princess. The film was however entertaining and typically the kind that Disney has excelled at over the years. I certainly recommend this film for family viewing. Julie Andrews does a fine performance as the Queen and Anne Hathaway does a fantastic job as the princess, I think she has a great career as an actress ahead of her.

It had the potential of being a really funny fish-out-of-water movie, but instead it is very bland and contains both shoddy directing and editing. It didn't really feel like there was that much of a stretch from the protagonist being a nerdy student and then being a princess. So basically what we're watching is not a movie - but just an extremely long and drawn out makeover movie. It's very predictable - even for a predictable movie. And Julie Andrews, as the queen, can't seem to figure out whether to overact or underact. I mean for God's sake, she talks to the main character in an office, not even from a throne. Whoever made these weird decisions really dropped the ball. Even if you have very low expectations for this movie, which I had, you still will be disappointed.",The Princess Diaries

Ten-twenty minutes into it, I was like, Um, What??? Halfway in, I was outraged. Leaving the T.V room of my friend, I was determined that I would like to sue Disney and the makers of the movie. What is WITH those people? Why couldn't they stick to the book? The book was funny, original, and interesting. The movie was seriously crap. One of the best things about the books was the setting in New York, not to mention Grandmere's total scariness, Lilly's bossiness, Lana's total cruelty, and TINA HAKIM BABA. None of these things were there in the movie. Lana Weinberger (Thomas?) was not even mildly threatening. The school was more like some museum. And, what, there weren't even any students in for Assembly when Mia threw up? Michael was scarily creepy-looking. Josh was - less said about him, the better. Julie Andrews was graceful and supportive and beautiful - but, HELLO, GRANDMERE IS NOT SUPPOSED TO BE GRACEFUL AND FRIENDLY AND BEAUTIFUL!!! Anne Hathaway as Mia was the only watchable thing about the movie, and not even because of her (lack of) acting skills, but because she was at least portraying Mia like in the book. And she is also quite pretty. But apart from her - and the part in the movie where Mia dines with all those important people, and where she gives her speech, and of course the part where Lana sings that song at the beach party - the movie is TERRIBLE!!!",The Princess Diaries
124,Arwyn,A pedantic waste of time,1,3 January 2002,"Not even good performances by Julie Andrews and Hector Elizondo could save this from being a dreadful waste of time.  It was so predictably awful that I can't believe it did even relatively well in the box office.  My only surmise is that a lot of people thought it would be good and by the time they discovered it wasn't, it was too late to get a refund.The story had potential, but as usual it was taken to such extremes as to defeat the original purpose.  The melodrama and the predictable bad lines were so consistent that we actually started a betting pool to call what would happen next.  It was the only way to survive watching the film.If this is the sort of thing we allow our children to watch, it is no wonder they grow up with their minds made of mush.  There was absolutely no substance to this movie - nothing you could wrap your mind around and think about.  There are good movies out there aimed at teens, such as 'Ten things I hate about you' and 'She's all that'.  These movies center around fairly normal people with normal problems, mixed in with good lines and imaginative plot twists.  But this movie seems to say that your life will wind up perfect only if your grandmother happens to be a queen and you wind up being a princess.  The only thing you might improve by watching this movie is your ability to groan.",The Princess Diaries

I read the book first, knowing that I would see the movie and wanted to see the differences between the two...THERE WERE TONS!!!!!  Don't get me wrong, I loved both the book and the movie, but it seemed as if the only thing that was the same was the concept...and most of the people's names.  They weren't even in the same city!!!  The actors did an awesome job, and even Mandy Moore was believable as Lana Weinberger.  Too bad Erik von Detten had a jerk for his part...Anne Hathaway was great, and she will be in many movies in the next few years after this performance.  Julie Andrews was, of course, awesome...Could you expect less?  In the book, one of the major topics was Mia's mom dating her teacher, but it was only mentioned in the movie.  They went into more detail with Michael in the film though, and I didn't mind, because I found him strangely attractive...Hehe!!!  Good looking guy, let me tell you!!

If you just want to have some fun, head to the Multiplex now.I've been looking forward to this movie for months.  I'm a die hard Julie Andrews fan and like fairy tales (so sue me.)  Looking at the critics reviews today depressed me.  My paper said it was a bomb, Ebert seemed to hate it with every fiber of his being.  My sister, niece and I went anyway, and had a blast.  Mia isn't the most believable nerd, lets face it frizzy hair, glasses and bushy eyebrows don't hide the fact that she is a beauty.  But clumsiness and low self image are fun.  Lilly was the perfect best friend, and Michael a wonderful not so secret admirer.  I loved Joe and Grandma.  Josh and friends were slime balls.In the end this isn't a story about make-overs being life altering.  Mia is uncomfortable in her new skin and her false friends are quickly found out. Mia learns that believing in herself is what counts, and her grandmother learns a few things too.",The Princess Diaries
127,riley453,"Cute, funny, sassy and most of all ... innocent.",10,15 June 2006,"Some people have said this movie is a Disney version of Pretty Woman.The difference between Pretty Woman and Princess Mia... Pretty Woman - prostitute, Richard Gere gives her money to buy cocktail dress.She already is beautiful. Princess Diaries - young teen, not very good looking, royal blood,grandmother Queen of Genovia, has to learn to walk, talk, eat and behave like princess. OK, yes, Mia isn't very attractive before she finds out she is of royal blood. Yes, she's attractive when the glasses come off and make up goes on. However, I wouldn't say that it was offensive to women in ANY manner! It really annoys me that an innocent movie like this receives a bad comment on the front page of IMDb that everyone can see when it is clearly not true. This is a nice movie to sit down with the kids and watch.It is innocent, there are no connotations of any kind but most of all it's just entertainment.It's Julie Andrews for crying out loud!! One person went so far as to write it as 'Disneyfied version of Pygmalion'. However, Pygmalion got its own remake with a new title 'My Fair Lady' with Audrey Hepburn.As Queen Clarisse would say to a comment regarding Pygmalion to Princess Diaries ...

I was looking forward to this film and the trailers looked good, but what a disappointment. Great actors, abysmal situations. The silly bits weren't. The romance didn't click. Perhaps it was a case of throwing everything but the kitchen sink into a picture and forgetting to build something. Two relatively recent movies that did seem to get it right are ""She's All That"" (where the guy actually cares about the girl) and ""Parent Trap II"" (where there is silliness and 'tension' and coherency). The audience was pretty quiet during the film (except where there were some nicely funny bits), but mostly it was a drag.",The Princess Diaries

Anne Hathaway offers a spectacular delivery of the awkward girl gone popular who must face navigating moral decisions which will alter her life and automatically affect all of her relationships. The moral seems to be that it's better to be good to your true friends who treat you well no matter what rather than fall prey to the illusion of the promise of friendship by the popular, superficial kids who only act like they care once you've acquired status, but don't actually care about who are you are inside.",The Princess Diaries

Sure at times it was predictable and corny, but it was a cute movie, and it had a great message for younger girls. At some point thru the film, I'm sure any girl could relate to Mia somehow.I think Julia Roberts should watch her back because Anne Hathaway is a great young actress whos soon going to be on the cover of every magazine. Mandy Moore is an ok actress, at times you could see the cutesy pop-singer in her, more than you could see the mean cheerleader she was suppose to play But she did a good job for her first film, better than most singer-turned-actresses do.Overall I give the film an 8/10.

For some people, that makes for a boring time.  For others (like me), it's a pleasant diversion from the usual stuff that comes out of Hollywood.  Not that there isn't a place for movies containing adult themes...there certainly is.   It's just that so many times violence, sex, and the rest is thrown in with no real substance or merit.""The Princess Diaries"" is what it claims it is: a nice fairy tale that warms the heart.  No, it's not an artistic masterpiece.   Yes, it's a movie to take the kids to (especially young girls) that won't drive you up the wall.  Prediction: Anne Hathaway will be around for a long time.

I am not a big fan of Garry Marshall and was not looking for anything else but brainless mind-stimulation... And certainly didn't get anything more!
The idea is cute, but is a syndrome that most girls are done with when they reach the age of 10... The princess-obsession I mean.It's cruel to drag yourself or any of you loved ones through this more than once, and if you think the present of Julie Andrews gives the movie any credits YOU ARE WRONG! It's torture to watch her mingle with anything modern if you are like me, and never got further than The Sound of Music.

I doubt many people can seriously look at this movie and like it for more than anything but entertainment value, which it still didn't have much of. Julie Andrews is an award-winning actress, why did she participate in this movie? I have no idea what she was thinking. Other than Julie Andrews, the acting in this movie was painful. The directing was the worst part of this movie, I have no respect for Garry Marshall. His decisions were poor and ill-timed.

The movie, however, is far from witty or realistic. The characters are not well defined. The performances are really good, and it is a fairly interesting movie, but it lacks the finer details. There are some elements that make a movie great and this movie lacks those elements.As a movie, i would say that it was a fairly good attempt at a children's movie. It was enjoyable in some parts and it was fun to watch. But it is the kind of movie that one would rent rather than go to the cinema to watch. In fact, a person who has not read the book might think the movie was original and fascinating. But in my opinion, The movie was a poor reflection of the book. I know it is only supposed to be based on the book and is not supposed to be a movie replica of the book, but there are some things that one should never change, and The Princess Diaries has changed those things. Still, I'd recommend this movie. It's worth one watch. Just one, though.",The Princess Diaries

How many times have you seen this before? [Director Gary Marshall seems to be running out of ideas;  this is almost a remake of Pretty Woman, but without the charm, Julia Roberts, or the sex].This movie was not entertaining.  So very predictable and extremely quaint in its morals and characterizations [Mandy Moore, playing the ""bad girl,"" calls people names, plays childish pranks, and sings ""Stupid Cupid"" -- and she's the ARCH NEMESIS of the movie]. Even though the subject matter involves high school, this is really for the preteen set.  Anyone above the age of 12 should avoid it like the plague.

144,RebeccaWood,"Great Movie for the ""Awkward"" Girl in All of Us.",7,28 July 2007,"I remember when I first watched this movie. I was an intensely tomboyish preteen and pretty much against all media with the word ""Princess"" even associated with it. Needless to say, I was not super excited when my cousins came over and popped this bad boy(err..girl) in our VCR. I honestly didn't expect much: Disney, princess, tiaras, romance, please.But as I began watching it, I soon realized that I identified completely with Mia,(Anne Hathaway) an extremely awkward teenage girl who was rebellious, weird, unpopular, and yet, was offered the one thing that almost all teenage girls dream of: princess-ship, complete with new looks, limos, balls, gowns, hot guys, and power. Whoop!Yet, she practically had to be dragged into it kicking and screaming. Forget preppy hair do's! Just leave me alone! Here was a princess story I could relate to! Mia wasn't some whistling girl with a pure heart who caught birds on her fingers while working at a terrible job, that really wasn't that terrible because she made it fun! She was an ungraceful chick who had learned to cope with the hardships of life, but not in the usual way. Everything about her was weird, and she liked it like that.But Mia had to grow up during this movie. She went from awkward to awesome in a matter of two hours. I loved the transformation were she went from laughed at, to applauded for by the end when she slams ice cream all over Lana's(Mandy Moore) cheer leading outfit(something I personally loved because I was not particularly fond of cheer leading at this point..) Overall, great chick/ teen girl flick. It makes you believe that no matter how messed up your life is or you are, you still have a chance to be some super cool girl. And who doesn't want to be a princess? Really.",The Princess Diaries

And that is cute. The actors are great, funny and they do it well. They have reason to be proud of this movie. For that I will give them 2 point! The next 2 points are for Julie Andrews and Anne Hathaway. She plays Queen Clarisse, and she does it very well, even though I don't think I would ever have imagined her, in this kind of film. Anne Hathaway, playing the darling Princess Mia, is also very funny and no bad actress at all! The last point is for the director: I can't believe he actually had the guts to do this. But I have seen some extra material from the movie, and it seems to me that the team had a hell of a lot fun. And that is important too, when you make a film. The perfect film to discuss clothing!

At some point, it kind of makes you dream about having an estranged grandma that comes with a throne, which, I guess, we can all relate to. It was nice to see Anne Hathaway again, but the true delight of the movie has to be Julie Andrews. The woman rocks! And the royal parts suit her best, she does have a regal attitude.

I'd say pretty much any female will find this movie a pleasure to watch, as it fulfills the childhood fantasy we've all craved in a humorous and tasteful way, and in the end leaves you satisfied and feeling good.The characters are all endearing and special in their own ways, from Mia's disgruntled neighbor, to the classic ""mean girl"", to her typical ""backstreet boy"" crush. I admit that sometimes it does become a little trite and cliché at times, what with the overdone stereotypes, but it keeps the viewer intrigued so it's not at all negative. It might even make you chuckle believe it or not! However this movie, like many other movies, is not for everyone; rather, this movie is better suited for tweens and teens. And when I say that, I am in NO WAY belittling it or putting it down, because to me 'Princess Diaries' is and always will be an enjoyable, funny, and at times childish film.

One day, on the contrary, she was told to be the Princess of a country, which is very opposite to her former expectation. What a big turning to her life ! What she will undergo ? Mia is my very first and memorable impression about this movie. Anything about her comes from Anne Hathaway's virgin performance. After deeply understand the character-Mia, Anne let Meg's story vivid on the screen. Her acting is natural and every detail show a combination of her own understanding of the character and the shining of the character itself. I noticed some details about Mia,which is very sophisticated. Mia's school uniform represent the 1950's elegance. The black socks and ties. What a copy of Audrey Hepburn in ""Breakfast at Tiffany's"". Mia's smile remind me of another famous actress-Julie Roberts, who has become a mother recently. The beautiful big smile is very eye-catching and also memorable. Oh,I remember another person who also have those big smile. She is Amélie Poulain. The Story is philanthropic and extraordinary.It's not simply a Cinderella story.But, a great story about grandmother and granddaughter, a education-valued story about mother and daughter, a special story about father and daughter,a ever-sweet story about first love, a beautiful story about friendship. Above all, it's a growing story. Based on Meg's classic story The Princess Diary, the motion picture make her characters believe-like in another artistic way. Just like having read Margaret's story (Gone With The Wind), you then watch O'Selznick's GWTW movie. Your feeling will be like: I seemed to be a part of the story. Those characters are just and always around you! Clarisse: The Sound of Music is recognized as a movie that is priceless, so, this also recognized the supporting actress's performance is priceless. Julie is an actress that could act well on any characters. The governess,the grandmother or on Broadway, etc. Helen (Caroline Goodall) played a vital role is Mia's growing period. This daughter and mother is a good role model. Because they show the grand respect for each other. Anyone can't grow without friend, the princess,too. From the friendship with Lilly, Mia knows how to tell the truth, how to apologize and how to deal with something that is uniquely occurred in teenager, which is called Growing Pains. Like other reviewers, I also feel the last sentence Mia told Michael is Soooooooo...... Cool ! :-O ""You saw me when I was invisible."" Why we feel cool ? Because that's what true love is. And, especially, that's what true love is to a princess !! Joe is a person we can't ignore. He acted as a imitate friend to Mia. He told her what she should be. And he is virtually the bodyguard. Oh, by the way, he is a very very special one ! Some of the songs in The Princess Diary is also memorable."" A Summer Song"" remind me of those romantic school kisses.

I enjoyed it throroughly as an adult, and I know some kids who would love it, too.Julie Andrews sparkled as the Queen, and Hector Elizondo stole his scenes with such understated performances he deserves to win an Oscar. As far as Anne Hathaway goes, it's hard to believe the ugly ducklig ""freak"" of the beginning of the movie is the same person as the Princess at the end, with Ms. Hathaway taking a challenging role and making it so her own that it couldn't have been performed by anyone else.Fans of Marshall's ""Pretty Woman"" will recognize not only Mr. Elizondo as the chauffeur, but also Larry Miller (the hairdresser) and Alan Kent (you may not reconize his face, but listen for that unforgettable line: ""It happens all the time."").Karl Walter Lindenlaub's cinematograhy was superb, with even plain interiors looking marvelous. Sound was perfect, and John Debney's music was spot on, if you can ignore the fact that the people supposedly playing instruments are clearly faking it.

It is a throwback to older movies designed for entertainment rather than to shock or to dazzle with special effects.  It can be enjoyed by moviegoers of all ages with no violence, bad language or nudity, a rarity these days.  It won't win any awards but is more entertaining than most movies issued last year.",The Princess Diaries
168,stockchic59,A wonderful film for kids and adults alike! Garry Marshall did it AGAIN!,10,5 August 2001,"Garry Marshall did it again! A jewel of a film a heart-warming and wholesome, funny Disney production!!Julie Andrews shines as always! Excellent choice and I was glad she didn't passed this one up. Hector Elizondo, simply marvelous! The role fits him to a T! Anne Hathaway, the NEXT Julia Roberts!!! WOW! What Garry Marshall did to Pretty Woman, he did it AGAIN with The Princess Diaries! KUDOS to Garry Marshall!!I went to see this film due to the long absence of Julie Andrews on the big screen. Knowing, this was a Disney production and Rush Hour2 and Planet of the Apes were showing in the same Cineplex as this, I didn't expect such an overwhelming  croweded  theater for The Princess Diaries. Not only there were children (grade school ages, teenagers) but adults my age were there too! On top of that young boys (high school level) were among the movie goers!This film is a hit. I laughed, I chuckled, and  clapped so hard , it  put a smile on my face throughout the film.I recommend me this not  only to kids but to my age groups (20 something, 30 something and beyond) !!Thanks Garry Marshall and THANK YOU Julie Andrews to once again grace the big screen!!I can't wait to get this on DVD!!",The Princess Diaries
169,xinli1,A surprisingly good movie for one that's rated G,9,11 August 2001,"I was pleasantly surprised by this movie. Given that the movie was rated G, I went into it with more than a little skepticism with regard to its quality.  And yet, there was something about the trailer that spoke to me on a level that I cannot define.  The movie was cute and sweet.  The clear lack of violence and other R rated material was a refreshing break from this summer's other box office hits.  Julie Andrews was magnificent as the queen. Why indeed, she was born to play a queen.  Her grace, elegance and charm gave the movie a sense of excellence that could not have been achieved otherwise.  Anne Hathaway, the talented 18 year old who plays Mia, walked the fine line between portraying the fairytale'ish princess and your everyday 16 year old teenager with exceptional skill.  Her clumsy screw ups and other social gaffes were charming and endearing.  And who could forget Hector Elizando?  It is his acting that gives the movie the touch of humanity that so perfectly complements everything else in the film.
Indeed, this is a movie that everyone will enjoy.  There is a part, within every one of us, that wants to be recognized, to be a princess (or a prince in the case of a guy).  And it is precisely to that part of us that this movie speaks.",The Princess Diaries

Anne Hathaway plays the role perfectly, making the awkward Mia extremely likable, as the heroine always should be.  Julie Andrews shines like a true royal.  The entire supporting cast adds something special to the film. It's quality family fun, and destined to be another Disney classic! 9/10 stars!",The Princess Diaries

The only real similarity concerning the plot is Mia turning out to be a princess. They added random things, changed characters and omitted crucial points/characters in the book. I won't go into detail, but as a book adaptation, it sucked.However, as a movie, it was quite enjoyable. Most of the acting was good enough for me. It's a good movie if you just feel like chilling and eating snacks that make you fat, in that it's fun, light-hearted and quite funny. It's cute, and it will appeal to a lot of people.If you don't like teeny-bopper movies, then this is NOT for you. This movie screams teeny-bopper.",The Princess Diaries

173,connielevitsky,"If you liked the books, don't watch the movie.",7,8 January 2015,"Watching the film by itself, it's easy to call it a good movie. Julie Andrews steals the show (as always), and Anne Hathaway does a good job, except she seems too grown-up after the makeover bit to pass for a teenager. Mandy Moore is clearly destined to be a teenager living in California for the rest of her damn life (sorry, Mandy). The storyline flows in a reasonable manner: Mia Thermopolis is a teenager living in San Francisco with her mother, who is an artist and has raised her with the financial help of her absent father. Her best friend is Lilly, and Lilly's older brother, Michael, serves as the token love interest. Mia's main concerns in life are the fact that she doesn't have breasts and she has a hopeless crush on Josh, a popular classmate who looks like he belongs at a country club rather than the beach. Mia finds out her dead father was actually a prince, she is the heir to the throne, and the entire plot consists of Mia trying to be a princess and having to decide if she actually wants to be royal or not, while dealing with the humiliation of her mother dating her teacher. Good, right?Except, if you've read the books, you realize that there is more to this story that should have been included, and that serious changes were made. In the books, Mia Thermopolis is a teenager living in New York with her critically acclaimed artist mother who specializes in still life. Mia's concerns are the environment, failing Algebra, and the fact that her mother is dating her Algebra teacher. Lilly Moscovitz is still her best friend, but her parents are psychoanalysts, and she is actually a lot meaner in the books than in the movie. Michael is actually a genius, as is Lilly. Mia's father is still alive, and is not a soft-spoken version of Billy Mays, but a bald, European prince who bribes Mia into attending princess lessons. Mia's grandmother is not Julia Andrews-esque, but is more akin to the likes of Cruella de Vil and Emily Gilmore. This woman has tattooed eyeliner, smokes like a chimney, and has an ugly dog named Rommel. Joe the chauffeur is now Lars the bodyguard, and Mia has more friends in the book than in the movie. The books offer a juicier story, more relatable and believable characters, and definitely is not a film that Disney would have wanted to make.The movie alone is okay, but compared to the books, it needs to be shelved in the ""let's not ever do that again"" of book-to-movie classification.",The Princess Diaries
174,branley,"Good family movie, particularly for young girls",7,6 August 2001,"I took my wife and 3 year old son to see this, because it's truly a miracle when a clean, moral movie comes out that I can take my young son to see.A few months ago I read an article by a women who was commenting on the sad fact that little girls don't want to grow up and be princesses any more. They want to grow up and be Britney Spears, Madonna, or perhaps their favorite hollywood actress.This movie did brought back the desire to grow up and be a princess, and as proof, just as the movie was ending, a little girl in front of us turned to her father and said, ""I want to be a princess daddy.""It is a refreshing movie, and the only reason it gets poor reviews is because of its strengths. In this day and age its a bad movie if it doesn't have sex, drugs, violence, or potty humor. So, if that's what you are looking for, then don't waste your money. But, if you want to see the way movies used to be, and if you want a movie that will inspire your little girl to grow up to be a princess, then this movie is perfect.",The Princess Diaries

Julie Andrews holds this picture together with her grace and charm as Queen Clarisse Renaldi, Her sheer screen presence illuminates the screen she is ably supported through a fine cast especially Anne Hathaway as Queen Clarissa's long forgotten granddaughter who finds out that if Genovia is to exist then she must decide if she wants to ascend to the throne! Julie Andrews decides that she is to be the one to educate the gawky teenager ( which is a hard act to follow especially as Julie has a perfect speaking voice and stands as straight as a die!).All in all of cause everything works out okay and everyone lives happily everafter. After such a long absence from the big screen (especially in this country) I for one hope that it won't be such a long wait next time to see Miss Andrews on the big screen again",The Princess Diaries
176,Delia-10-2,Where were the Diaries?,5,18 December 2001,"This movie, while I am sure was mildly enjoyable for the teenybopper set, barely even resembled the wonderful book it was taken from.  Why did they change so much of the plot?  (i.e. in the book, the father is living and has maintained a distant, but loving relationship with Mia.  In fact, he is the one to tell her about her heritage.  This fact leads to one of the most hilarious diary entries in the book - dealing with Mia's embarrassment over her father's sterility and the reason for it.) Also, why the need to have Mandy Moore sing her silly little ""Stupid Cupid"" song?  Was it written in her contract that she was to have her little musical number, no matter how excrutiatingly embarrassing it was to watch her.  For a moment, I thought I was watching a ""Back To The Beach"" remke.  The diary entries in the book are very honest and realistic, in that a teenager would really feel and talk the way Mia does.  But in the movie, the clumsiness and embarrassing situations are completely overdone.  I couldn't tell if the actors were over-acting all their stereotypical roles, or if it was just a poorly-written script.  This disappointing version completely lacked the feel of the book - and I am usually quite forgiving of screen adaptations of my favourite books.",The Princess Diaries

As a former *invisible*, I really appreciated this aspect of the movie.  I enjoyed all the performances, but especially Julie Andrews.  And personally, I thought Eric Von Detten as her misplaced dream lover was UGLY!  Neither my friend nor I saw anything within his skinny shallow frame that should appeal to Mia other than he was popular and she wasn't.  Robert Schwartman, however, as the boy who pines over the invisible girl who doesn't even notice him is a real cutie!

I've seen so many this year that did... including Artificial Intelligence and America's Sweethearts.  However, Princess Diaries was delightful.Anne Hathaway brings an incredible, youthful presence to the screen with professionalism that is often not seen in young actresses.  She is complemented perfectly by the veteran performance of Julie Andrews, who always radiates on screen and stays true to form in this film.Erik Von Detten and Mandy Moore are possibly not cut out to play bad guys -- they seem better-suited for the nice guy/gal roles -- but for these particular characters that they play, their jobs are well done.I was thoroughly entertained from moment one until the last, and I'm not even a member of the likely targeted age group.

The Princess Diaires should now be considered one of the best family films of all time as it provides constant entertainment for both children and their parents.  Anne Hathaway is enchanting as Mia the awkward teenager content with her life of invisibility.  It is not easy pulling off the ""Sabrina"" act but Ms. Hathaway did so with with flying colors.  Julie Andrews could not have been more perfect for her role as Queen Renaldi as she shows the world that she is still one of the most elegant actresses in history, even at the age of 65. Hector Elizondo, Gary Marshal's ever present good luck charm, gives a memorable performance as Joe, the backbone of the Renaldi Dynasty.

Her heart would be pounding with excitement, she'd be screaming with joy.But in this movie, for some reason (read:  in order to serve the plot) she hears the news and it's the worst thing that could possibly happen to her. I realize the story is a fairy tale, but the emotions should be real.The only good thing in the movie:  Heather Matarazzo is yelling for her friend, and someone else turns around, and she says, ""Not you!

The plot was childish and totally absurd. Who ever heard of a Genovia or whatever it was?? It was very slow moving, and the viewers never got anywhere in the movie fast. Remember the trailers? The trailers were funny, which was the reason that I paid to see this movie. The movie is soooo slow.The acting also contributed to the terrible plot. It was way too overacted. Mia's friend Lilly totally drove me insane with her whining. Trust me, if you watch the movie, you will be thinking, ""Just shut UP ALREADY!!!"" once you hear that girl speak.

The script was poor, the dialogue was vacuous, and the acting was shaky.  I considered walking out but was with someone else.  I even fell asleep two-thirds of the way through.

The only reason that I gave this piece of media 2 stars is because of Anne Hathaway and Julie Andrews. They take Z-grade material and with considerable effort elevate it to... a W. In addition to the poorly written script, which made ""She's The Man"" look like ""No Country For Old Men"" by comparison (why I keep getting sucked into bad tween comedies is a topic for another time), the supporting acting, excluding Elizando and Matarazzo, was abysmal.

One day, on the contrary, she was told to be the Princess of a country, which is very opposite to her former expectation. What a big turning to her life ! What she will undergo ? Mia is my very first and memorable impression about this movie. Anything about her comes from Anne Hathaway's virgin performance. After deeply understand the character-Mia, Anne let Meg's story vivid on the screen. Her acting is natural and every detail show a combination of her own understanding of the character and the shining of the character itself. I noticed some details about Mia,which is very sophisticated. Mia's school uniform represent the 1950's elegance. The black socks and ties. What a copy of Audrey Hepburn in ""Breakfast at Tiffany's"". Mia's smile remind me of another famous actress-Julie Roberts, who has become a mother recently. The beautiful big smile is very eye-catching and also memorable. Oh,I remember another person who also have those big smile. She is Amélie Poulain. The Story is philanthropic and extraordinary.It's not simply a Cinderella story.But, a great story about grandmother and granddaughter, a education-valued story about mother and daughter, a special story about father and daughter,a ever-sweet story about first love, a beautiful story about friendship. Above all, it's a growing story. Based on Meg's classic story The Princess Diary, the motion picture make her characters believe-like in another artistic way. Just like having read Margaret's story (Gone With The Wind), you then watch O'Selznick's GWTW movie. Your feeling will be like: I seemed to be a part of the story. Those characters are just and always around you! Clarisse: The Sound of Music is recognized as a movie that is priceless, so, this also recognized the supporting actress's performance is priceless. Julie is an actress that could act well on any characters. The governess,the grandmother or on Broadway, etc. Helen (Caroline Goodall) played a vital role is Mia's growing period. This daughter and mother is a good role model. Because they show the grand respect for each other. Anyone can't grow without friend, the princess,too. From the friendship with Lilly, Mia knows how to tell the truth, how to apologize and how to deal with something that is uniquely occurred in teenager, which is called Growing Pains. Like other reviewers, I also feel the last sentence Mia told Michael is Soooooooo...... Cool ! :-O ""You saw me when I was invisible."" Why we feel cool ? Because that's what true love is. And, especially, that's what true love is to a princess !! Joe is a person we can't ignore. He acted as a imitate friend to Mia. He told her what she should be. And he is virtually the bodyguard. Oh, by the way, he is a very very special one ! Some of the songs in The Princess Diary is also memorable."" A Summer Song"" remind me of those romantic school kisses. The final song ""Miracles Happen"" is special designed for this movie, for Mia and also for all of us. Now, I am recommending this movie to YOU from my heart.",The Princess Diaries

If she made one more bitter and unnecessary comment in an attempt at humor, I was going to shut it off. The message this movie attempts to get across is old, bland, and boring.

Based loosely on the Meg Cabot books, the film's setting in San Francisco leads to beautiful scenery and some great fun at the expense of those pesky hills.  The cast does a great job, despite being largely young, lending a fresh, light atmosphere to the time honored story.   It is definitely a feel-good movie that kept our whole family laughing.  Highly recommended for the romantic at heart.",The Princess Diaries
204,db1,"Great story, and rated G!",8,14 January 2002,"Can you believe that somebody actaully made an excellent movie without profanity, bare bodies, graphic violence, etc? Well, Disney actually pulled that off with THE PRINCESS DIARIES. This is a teen-female coming of age/ugly duckling story; however plot is well conceived (if only just a little predictable) and very well executed. Naturally, people will comment about Julie Andrew's stellar performance as the Queen of Genovia, and about Anne Hathoway's believeable job as a teen confronted with genetics, the press, and sudden popularity--a girl who before this had one ambition in life: ""to be invisible...and I'm very good at it!""In my mind, the glue to the whole movie was Hector Elizando's ""Joe."" Serving as the conscience of both the Queen and the Princess. He has some great lines and helps move the story along.It was nice to watch a movie that told a great story (with good lessons) that I could share with my kids...and still enjoy myself.",The Princess Diaries
205,Tony-385,Maybe 8-15 year old girls would enjoy this,1,11 February 2002,"I've seen a lot of bad movies, but this one takes the cake. Julie Andrews does an excellent job in her role, but there is little else to compliment in this film.  It is cliche' driven and generally most of the players overact, possibly to compensate for the story that trudges along.  Perhaps young girls would enjoy this film, but I don't think any adult would want to spend the time watching this ruined fairy tale. I give this movie a half star, only because Julie Andrews does such a fine job.",The Princess Diaries

Garry Marshall (Director of movies like ""Beaches"", ""Pretty Woman"", and ""Runaway Bride"") seems to use his usual charm once again.  Anne Hathaway is pretty funny as Mia.  (And, by the way, what a makeover!)  Even Heather Matarazzo as Lilly had her moments.""The Princess Diaries"" is good, but not original.  Haven't we seen this type of story before in movies like ""Pretty Woman"", ""She's All That"", and ""Miss Congeniality""?If you've seen the previews for ""The Princess Diaries"" and liked what you saw, you'd enjoy this movie.  If not, then maybe you shouldn't bother paying to see it in the theaters.  It's as funny, cute, and predictable as it looks. 6.5/10",The Princess Diaries

The preview audience I saw this with were primarily prepubescent girls who absolutely loved it!  They laughed out loud a lot, they were charmed with Mia's charm, they loved her story.It was cute, not very well acted but it had Julie Andrews at her most glowing, beautiful best.  She kept your focus whenever she was on screen. Hector Elizondo was sweet and Mandy Moore was the typical stereotypical evil cheerleader.  Mia's best friend is the outstanding young actress from ""Welcome to the Dollhouse.""   It has all the presence of a Disney-touched film, all the way down to momentously inspired water fountains and twinkle lights going off simultaneously with a kiss.Go see it for fun, for mindless laffs, for Julie Andrews, not the acting.",The Princess Diaries

Since then, I've seen it again many times and have appreciated every single bit of it. It's a masterpiece and I can now say I consider it the best love film ever made! Simply brilliant! As with all great films, there's no need to describe specific scenes or events to justify its greatness. Finally, let me link this film with great family film works. They prove here why comedy is a very serious matter. This film is not only comedy, although it has its moments, but he makes evident that a good comedian can produce a much deeper and dramatic film than a ""serious"" director.",The Princess Diaries

Being an avid lover of the books I was reluctant to see the movie from the second I saw the trailer. I really wish I hadn't wasted my time. This film is aimed at 6 - 10 year old girls as opposed to the 12 - 16 year old girls the books are aimed at therefor the plot is completely edited and sugarcoated and lacks the bite of the books. As much as I love Julie Andrews she was entirely the wrong woman to play Grandmere who is completely evil in the books unlike this kind, sweet, understanding lady she plays. I could spend literally hours pointing out exactly where all the main problems and plot differences lie but instead I shall just tell you to read the book or not bother at all.",The Princess Diaries

Its a pleasant movie and so many of the scenes had me rolling with laughter - especially the ones on Mia's Softball Practice, her hairdo makeover and her first formal dinner appearance. Good to see Hector in a role similar to the one he played in Pretty Woman. As always, he brings a touch of class to what he does. Some of the dialogs and scenes might be a bit contrived, but if you're interested in laughing your heart out a few times - this movie will be well worth the time.",The Princess Diaries

And for the miniscule minority not familiar with her astounding past performances, here is a chance to see one of the 20th century's most talented performers bringing class and character to a quintessential Disney family film. As Queen Clarisse, Julie Andrews is completely believable, and displays a definite flair for comedy and spontaneity (especially in the streetcar accident scene). Anne Hathaway is excellent as the awkward teenager. This film is definitely not for a sex/drugs/violence loving audience, or for the incurable cynic. But if you want to enjoy a nice afternoon at the movies immersed in a fantasy set in beautiful San Francisco, do not miss this movie! My vote: 8/10",The Princess Diaries

It sends a great message to kids about friendship and family with great comedic dialogue and physical comedy that keeps it from becoming preachy or too syrupy. As a mid 30's male, I was surprised at how many times I laughed outloud. Julie Andrews is, as always, a class act and this new kid Anne Hathaway has ""future Hollywood darling"" stamped on her forehead.

223,foreverdiva,"Silly, fun movie, even if it didn't do the books justice",8,1 December 2002,"This movie is not for those in the mood for a ""serious film experience"". To put it lightly, this movie is Pretty Woman without the prostitution (which isn't surprising, considering Gary Marshall directed both).Anne Hathaway is charming as Mia, the unlikely princess, though it's a little hard to believe that someone as gorgeous as her would be labeled an ""outcast"". Hector Elizondo is perfectly droll as Joe the bodyguard. Robert Schwartzman and Mandy Moore both do the best they can in their roles as The Not-So-Unattainable Crush Michael and The Bitchy Cheerleader Lana (respectivly), though both parts were severly underwritten.However, the two stand out stars were Julie Andrews as Queen Clairisse and Heather Matarazzo as Mia's friend Lily. Both are extremely talented actresses in their own rights, and they just steal the show whenever they're on screen.I won't waste time complaining that the books by Meg Cabot were better (they are). But if they's been literally brought to the screen, this movie never would have been the G-Rated Disney smash it was. (Not that there's anything wrong with being G-Rated!)However, the books had a certain adolescent raunchiness (as well as a completely different version of the Queen!) that just got lost in the translation.Rating: 8/10",The Princess Diaries

Of course, parts of the film plot differs from the book (of the same title) written by Meg Cabot, of which it was based on. Nevertheless, the film is an excellent story of a teenage girl, Mia Thermopolis, who is living in suburban San Francisco, who discovers that she is a royal and legitimate heir to the crown of Genovia. The story then continues as Mia struggles to discover who she really is, dealing with the near break-up with her best friend, Lily, and (of course) romance problems. In the end, Mia finally triumphs and realises that being a Princess is what she was born to do, after all. A very nice story which leaves you with a warm fuzzy feeling at the end of the movie. I hope Disney Pictures will continue the story of Mia with a sequel, I will definately be the first to watch it!",The Princess Diaries
226,Moonbeam girl,disappointing,4,5 April 2002,"While this film was semi-entertaining at times, it was usually just annoying.  Now, I don't as a general rule like ""Pygmalion"" stories, where a girl is taught to be completely different from who she is, that she is not worthy of being taken seriously unless she wears her hair a certain way or dresses a certain way.  While her mother and her (by the end of the movie of course) boyfriend both cared for her no matter what, no one else really did--including her grandmother.  Actually, the thing that really bugged me the most is that the director should have left in 2 of the deleted scenes available on the DVD version, one of her mother's date with the teacher and reaction to the new Mia, and one of Mia with what's-his-face-boyfriend-guy. The movie was discontinuous and incomplete without them.  Plus the acting was generally nothing special.",The Princess Diaries

230,matchboxer372,"Skip the flick, read the book (spoilers)",6,15 June 2003,"Before seeing ""The Princess Diaries"" in theaters, I was browsing through the book store and came across a book by the same name. The words 'Now A Major Motion Picture' were right across the front. I decided to buy it and read it, since the movie looked interesting enough and the short description on the back of the book sounded good. A week after I read it, I saw the movie and was highly disappointed. The book was a very well-written story meant for the younger teen set. The movie was a piece of fluff designed for those ages 5-9. The movie lacked any kind of depth, and it's the kind of film that makes you wonder if the screenwriters even picked up the novel.
Julie Andrews was good as the airy-fairy ""You Will Prevail"" grandmother, but the grandmother in the book (known not-so-affectionately as Grandmere) was--for lack of a better word--a complete bitch. The romance that Mia's mother had with her algebra teacher Mr. Gianini in the book was cut down to a single date with Mia's debate teacher in the movie. And the biggest skewered plot point of all: in the movie, Mia's father is dead, which is why Mia has to step up as princess. In the book, her father is very much ALIVE, but he can't bear children, so Mia (his illegitimate child) must reign.
Let's just put it this way: if you want a cheesy puff piece with little to no character development or plot, see the movie. If you want something with a bit more depth and characters that you can actually care about and relate to, pick up the book.",The Princess Diaries

Because her grandmother want Mia to be a princess, she have take a lesson of the beauty that make her looking better and more princess lesson...This movie is a sort of dramatic comedy and fictional movie. I think this is like not only the familiar Cinderella's story,but also a sweet story of misfit 15 year old teenager turned princess. Mia also show us a life of teen and just girl. Besides, the acting of Anne Hathaway and Julie Andrew is excellent. It is a heart- warming act as a granddaughter and grandmother. this movie is really fun.

Their combination are very funny, and their relationship strengthen gradually, that is heart-warming. Moreover, Anne is so lovely! When she is dressed up, she is very prettily, this is a girl's dream! The plot is good, but little childish, because Mia is in love with a friend, but hardly development.

What I don't get is why are the Backstreet Boys in the clip? Oh yeah, their song was pretty cool too. I didn't think it was them, but when we got to the credits and we stopped to read the ones for the songs I was like ""Oh, my god, is that the Backstreet Boys?"" which was kind of cool cos I haven't listened to their stuff for a while.

In my opinion, it's not the acting that totaled it, it's the stupid plot/corny dialogue that threw the last dirt onto the grave.****SPOILERS*****Basically, Disney dumbed the entire plot of Meg Cabot's series for the twelve-and-under set.  Instead of Mia's father having testicular cancer, and Mia's parents never being married, Mia's father divorced her mother and then died tragically.And then there's the whole Grandmere scandal.  In the novels, Grandmere is the antagonist: a scary pain in the ass grandmother who Mia constantly struggles against. In the movie, Mia and Grandmere suddenly become best friends.Plus, what's with the yoga?  And debate class?  Mr. G and Mia's inability to do Algebra and sports are comic reliefs in the book.In my opinion, had they followed the books more and NOT Disney-ed it up, the movie would have been okay.I loved the casting for Michael & Lilly Moscovitz, as well as Lana.",The Princess Diaries
239,WhitePretzel,"Nicely Cast, Dismally Written",5,21 February 2005,"This movie has a few saving graces - namely, its cast. Anne Hathaway, Robert Carmine, Heather Matarazzo, and Larry Miller are wonderfully cast so as to bring to life the characters of the charming novel chronicles of Mia Thermapolis. It is near impossible to imagine anyone else in the roles of Mia, Michael and Lilly. However, other characters (most often ones invented for the movie to suit other Gary Marshall regulars), are not very well-cast. Julie Andrews is far too sweet for the horrific terror that is Grandmere in the books. Other attractive, but not necessarily talented, actors fill the parts of Mia's family, friends, and enemies, including the otherwise winning Hector Elizondo who doesn't suit the original role of Mia's Swedish bodyguard Lars at all.This movie, if aimed toward its original intended audience, and written extremely better, would have been a cult classic, if not an everlasting cinematic masterpiece. The novels by Meg Cabot are a perfect blend of comedy and near-tragedy, and, if properly adapted, would surely have an impact on its viewers. The characters in this movie are POORLY developed. Time and again, sacrifices are made to plot and character to set up for slapstick moments or otherwise clichéd Disney bits. With all of these sacrifices, it's hard to find these moments the least bit endearing. The whole movie is but a splay of these various Disney ""bits."" Unnescessary changes are made EVERYWHERE. Names are changed, the entire setting is flopped to the other side of the country, the antagonistic Grandmere is replaced with sweet grandma Clarisse, instead of rendering Mia's estranged father impotent he is killed off, Genovia is changed from sensible principality to inexplicable kingdom, and numerous names were ever so slightly altered for no apparent reason. Another issue that should be much more heavily touched upon is the ethnic cleansing of the casting. Originally, Albert Einstein HS was much more diverse. Indian characters Tina Hakim Baba and her boyfriend are not even supplanted in the film (robbing it of a touching arc in the story that displays Mia's sensitivity). Also removed is Shameeka, one of Mia's black friends. This really upsets me because these were all very good characters besides adding a healthy dose of ethnic variety. Also supplanted is Lilly's boyfriend, a Russian violinist, with magician Jeremiah. Makes you wonder if perhaps the original novel was a bit too ""racy"" for Disney, if you'll excuse the pun.If there had even BEEN a plot for this movie, I would have been satisfied. However, it seems as though there was not even a semblance of it. It is just a collage of exhibitions of Mia's clumsiness. Intelligent humor, dry humor, sarcasm and aspects of the liberal lifestyle of Mia and family of the novel are completely eradicated. This film robs the novel of its charm, and its only redeeming feature is, again, the casting of the lead characters (excluding Julie Andrews).Not only is this a dismal failure as an adaptation, its immature humor gives the film a feeble foundation - capitalizing on slapstick and the makeover turning point for Mia, it is hardly anything new, and only Anne Hathaway and company make this film truly worthwhile. It is my hope that this film will someday be revisited by a screenwriter who would remain truer to the witty and fun novels that it claims to be based on. It would be a shame that such a film mightn't have Robert Carmine, Anne Hathaway, and Heather Matarazzo in it.",The Princess Diaries
240,Hawkslash91,A few words from a simple-minded Disney fan,9,28 August 2006,"I'm sure you'll find that as you read this you will discover ""a few words"" to me means something short of an essay, and ""simple-minded"" comparative to an analytical computer. Which I will apologize for in advance (I know myself too well -_-).The Princess Diaries is bound to be one of Disney's classics. There is no question about that. Many people have submitted such comments as ""It wasn't as cheesy as I expected"" or ""It was much better than I thought."" Another prevailing opinion is that the casting of the movie, and the chosen director, were great. On all of these points I most heartily agree on.Now, the negatives. The strongest opposition to the movie is that it is totally unfaithful to the series by Meg Cabot. Personally, I have never read the series. BUT! Before you sigh and turn away, read the next sentence: I HAVE skimmed through the first book, (in my case, ""skim"" means reading it in a complete random order, although by the end I did manage to read most of the book) so I AM aware of the father's inability to...uh...reproduce, Lily's original Russian boyfriend (who played the violin, I believe?), the grandmother's not-so-pleasant personality, etc.None of which are portrayed in the movie. Which is a great disappointment to those who are die-hard fans of the series.But. It's only common knowledge that novels remade into movies are always twisted and changed until it only resembles the original storyline. It's usually only the extremely popular or classic books, with worldwide recognition, such as The Da Vinci Code, the Harry Potter series, and The Secret Garden, that are saved from facing total transformation. And even then, most people that I'm acquainted with have confessed the novelized version is always the better.Yes, there are exceptions to what I'm saying. Of course there are. But hear me to the end.Disney, especially, has a tendency to turn everything into a children's fairy tale. Because the entire company is a company devoted to children. Its aim is not to portray a novel the way it is written, but to give a classic happy story to their fans. That is the contract it has forged with its audiences.Take the Disney classics, for example. Beauty and the Beast, Aladdin, The Little Mermaid...they were all based off original fairy tales. But even they were changed completely in Disney's portrayals. Belle (Beauty and the Beast) originally had two jealous sisters. Aladdin had a mother and an evil uncle. Ariel (The Little Mermaid) turned into bubbles (died) in the end. None of these happened in the movies.But we (the Disney fans) love them. Not because we loved the original fairy tales and loved to see them on screen (if that's what you wanted, you would've watched the original French movie Beauty and the Beast), but because we fell in love with the movie itself, the characters the movie gave us, and the story the MOVIE told us.>>The Disney movies stand for themselves. I think that's their strong point. They don't have to rely on what novels or fairy tales they were originally based off of, but they stand as independent films, having EVOLVED from another novel or fairy tale.Everyone's watched Disney films. This should have been expected of the Princess Diaries, too. I'm sure Meg Cabot was aware of Disney's reputation--if she wanted her novel to be copied onto the screen, she would have chosen 20th Century Fox or Warner Bros. That's what J.K. Rowling did. I'M surprised so many people were shocked to find the movie was not like the novel.To be fair, I do admit that Disney HAS, on some occasion, been pretty true to the stories some of the films were based on. (Holes, for example, and Chronicles of Narnia.) But a storyline like Princess Diaries' couldn't go that way.>>I do think that out of all the movie companies, Disney was the best choice for this movie--the other companies may have been more faithful to the series, but only Disney would have made it a classic.And I am a personal fan of Julie Andrews and Anne Hathaway, and they pulled off a great combo in this film, I believe. I also enjoyed watching Mandy Moore in A Walk to Remember, so I had my eyes on her during this movie, too.Everyone's entitled to their opinions, definitely. So while I will never tell anyone off for hating this movie, I will also take the liberty to say that The Princess Diaries, while not Academy Award material, is definitely one of my favorite and heart-warming films.",The Princess Diaries
241,ladykayedee,favorite movie,10,18 August 2005,"I loved this movie and although it may have been slightly cliché, the dialog was quite smart and it was quite a funny movie. I think that if you expect the movie to be Oscar worthy, it will obviously fall short. But as it only attempts to be a sweet story about a misfit 15 year old turned princess, it completely lives up to it's potential. I think that Julie Andrews completely made the movie and that Anne Hathaway also did an excellent job. The movie is great for people of all ages because it has a simplistic plot yet has great one liners and great repartee between the characters of the Queen and Princess Mia. I also think that the minor characters are great also because they provide even more comic relief.",The Princess Diaries
242,charger3838bbl,movie,10,20 December 2004,"To whom it may concern, I was wanting to know if there if a making for princess diaries 3. If so when will it be coming out. I want to say how much this movie has inspired me to go out and not be afraid to be what I want to be, even if you get put down or laugh at. I have been able to look at a new day without saying help me I don't want to be here. Your movies are so inspiring that I am 25years old and I still love to watch them. Thank you for everything that you have done to help me through everything. I hope to see more of your wonderful movies in the near future. I will always love the princess diaries movies the best. Anyone can be a princess on the inside even if you really aren't.Thank you, Connie",The Princess Diaries
243,zippymippy,A priceless Cinderella story,10,27 December 2004,"The Princess Diaries is 1 of my favorite movies. I love it because it is funny, cute, romantic, and it had a good story plot. This movie has good humor ,not cheese humor, and it is a chick flick but not so much that guys won't like it. Also it is a good teen or family movie because it doesn't have a dumb plot that doesn't make any sense, or any bad language ,or sexual content. Also Garry Marshall, the directer, did a very good job turning the book ,""The Princess Diaries"" by Meg Cabot, into the movie. As well Anne Hathaway did a super job for her first movie. Julie Andrews did a good job acting too. Well, this is another priceless Cinderella story with an urban twist. I suggest you see it if you have not, I'm sure you will like it or even love it!",The Princess Diaries
244,toyracer,"Tired, overworked clichés in a pink, plastic wrapper",3,13 February 2005,"This film made me very uncomfortable for a couple of reasons. The first reason was that it was a cliché of the Hollywood cliché about royalty and royals. Do they really think aristocratic life is like this? The second reason this film made me uncomfortable was that I think some people might actually thinking exactly like B Hollywood scriptwriters think aristocrats and their that art (the term used loosely here) imitates life. Imagine a bunch of people walking around with their noses in the air and behaving help behave, while an American teenager educates them on pop culture. Cue the jealous stepsister and you have an awful fairy story without the magic. Awful, plastic B-grade smeh that should not have made it onto cable TV, and I shouldn't have watched it.",The Princess Diaries
245,ritagubina,I think this movie is really wonderful.,8,21 June 2015,"When I watched this film I have really interested in it , and I really like Princess Diaries . Perhaps there is something not very interesting but it doesn't make this movie bad . I really like changing with appearance and character of the main hero . And I love Anne Hathaway(Mia Thermopolis) her play was wonderful . I recommend it to you . But remember that this film is for girls 11-13 years old. If you want to change yourself watch this movie. If you want get fun , watch this movie. Probably you could think that this movie isn't instructive , and the worst is - you could be right...But it doesn't make this movie silly ,or boring.",The Princess Diaries
246,nykara,Totally Loved it!,10,9 July 2005,"When I was staying at my mums house for a few weeks on holidays she bought both 1 and 2 on DVD, we sat down and watched them both one after the other. If your looking for a nice fun light hearted movie that you can have a few laughs with along the way then Princess Diaries is definitely perfect for that. I believe that was the aim for the movie when they made it, in which case they did it and did it well. If your a female who is in to nice light ""chick flicks"" then this one would be well suited for you, as well as young girls as its really suited for all ages. Probably not the kind of movie most guys would go for but then I don't think it was aimed at the male population either. (Having said that though my boyfriend watched it with me and had a few laughs along the way too, not that I think he would admit that ;)).",The Princess Diaries
247,sschmi,"fun and relevant, even for non royalty!",8,25 August 2018,"Although this is not the greatest movie of this genre I've seen recently, it is nonetheless a fun, charming, and surprisingly deep movie. Mia's growth as an individual is portrayed well and is nicely balanced with comical lines and situations. As a woman who has battled with low confidence and appearance issues, I liked how the movie showed that, although Mia changes her appearance to be a princess, her quirks continue to shine through. (So many small moments like her hitting her teacher on the head, etc. remind me of my self in high school and made me laugh.) After her ""transformation,"" she maintains her integrity as a person, while slowly gaining confidence - not just because her appearance has improved, but because her grandma, mother, and father teach her how to have faith in herself. The scene where she addresses everyone with wet hair in sweats highlights how her self worth does not stem from her appearance. The ending has her beginning her princess life, ready to leave behind the high school so that she can make meaningful change for others. While she has a love interest, I was thankful to see it did not affect her personal journey throughout the movie.
side note: While it may seem problematic to show that women, particularly in the political realm, are given more respect when they look more well groomed / attractive, I see it more as the act of self care - e.g. showering, shaving, doing your nails, brushing your hair - can bring about confidence simply because it makes someone feel more taken care of. (take it from a girl who really doesn't primp myself ever - when I do, it makes me feel pretty great.) However, it is a shame that many people value physical appearance much more highly than the charisma and confidence that can be imbued regardless of appearance. I assume that even if Mia were filled with confidence in the beginning of the movie, she nonetheless would have been forced to have a makeover.",The Princess Diaries
248,jaclynbarker-82108,One of the best,10,14 November 2020,"This movie transcends generations. I've never been transported back to a place like I have with this movie. It came out when I was in elementary school and I adored it. I got it on vhs and watched it every week.
I just now watched it again as a 27 year old adult and oh my gosh. I loved it even more, if that's possible. It made me laugh more now than as a kid. Julie Andrews and Anne Hathaway are pure gold in this film and made it timeless. It is purely girl perfection for anyone who grew up in the late 90s and early 2000s.",The Princess Diaries
249,funkymonkey5142,"""Delightful""",7,1 April 2006,"When I first heard the title of the movie, I thought it would be exactly like the book. Boy, was i wrong. The movie is close to the book but not exactly like it. I think one of the reasons the changed the movie from the book is because the book is for older kids while the movie is for younger kids. The movie is for kids who dream of becoming a princess one day.The movie is basically about a girl who wakes up one day and figures out that she is a princess (what are the odds of that?). She has to learn the rules of becoming a princess and slowly starts to like her best friend's brother. The movie has a happy ending so all's well that ends well.",The Princess Diaries
250,alyonabelonogova,For all times,8,12 August 2018,"Honestly, the first time I've actually seen this film was when I was pimply teenage girl who also dreamed to become a princess one day. So, that time I found the plot very impressive and captivating. These lovely stories where unattractive freaky geeks suddenly turn into beautiful self-confident kickass people always seemed very fascinating and inspiring to me.
To my amazement, after watching ""The Princess Diaries"" about seven years later I'm still claiming this story is quite convincing. I laughed at Anne Hathaway's grimace and other characters's jokes were pretty amusing. What's of great importance is the main message the author wants to share with the audience (from my point of view). The premise is that we all often do not value the simple things until we lose them by reason of our stupidity. We don't value our real friends (who love our attractively weird personality, not our beatiful appearance) until we reject them for some popular guy built of lie and flattery. We don't value our privacy and freedom until we become the subject of gossiping. And we definitely don't value our happy and carefree childhood until we have to grow up and make responsible decisions. 
Anyway, the movie is neither tiresome nor second-rate and I'd higly recommend watching it with your family or just by yourself. The excellent acting of Anne Hathaway (and watching her clumsy geeky character transforming into cut a dashing figure), Julie Andrews, Héctor Elizondo and other exceptionally talented actors certainely worth seeing.",The Princess Diaries
