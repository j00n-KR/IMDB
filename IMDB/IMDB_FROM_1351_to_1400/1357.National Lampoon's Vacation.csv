0,TheLittleSongbird,A comedy classic,10,17 July 2011,"I enjoyed Christmas Vacation but was disappointed in European Vacation. The original Vacation though for me will always be the best one, being the funniest and most original of them in my opinion. The film looks great, the cinematography and scenery are striking and the fashions and the film as a whole hold up well. The soundtrack has a great energy about it, the script is very funny and quotable, the gags don't fall into the trap of being tired and stale and the story is well-paced, energetic and heart-warming. Chevvy Chase and Beverly D'Angelo give great performances, as do Randy Quaid, Eugene Levy and John Candy. All in all, a great film and a comedy classic. I personally wouldn't go as far to say it is one of the best movies ever, but I would class it as a personal favourite. 10/10 Bethany Cox",National Lampoon's Vacation
1,Leofwine_draca,A genuinely funny - and influential - American comedy of the 1980s,8,27 July 2016,"NATIONAL LAMPOON'S VACATION is the first and undoubtedly the best of the NATIONAL LAMPOON series, a genuinely funny road movie with strong performances and first-rate direction from GHOSTBUSTERS star Harold Ramis. The plot adopts a simple journey narrative and one which would be repeated for the sequel European VACATION; the long-suffering Griswold family go from place to place, wreaking havoc all the while.There's a strong mixture of different types of humour here, from end-of-their-tether character laughs to slapstick gags and plenty of wisecracks and innuendo. Much of the humour is witty and it also has a fairly dark edge that makes it stand out from the usual John Hughes-scripted family fare, particularly the bits with Randy Quaid, the dog, and the aunt. The movie belongs to Chevy Chase, who is very entertaining in the lead role, but there are a handful of supporting performers who don't disappoint either. Beverly D'Angelo, in a MUCH racier role than she played in the sequels, sparks off Chase very well, and there's a late-stage cameo from John Candy which continues to delight. In fact, there's very little to dislike overall about this popular '80s comedy.",National Lampoon's Vacation
2,SnoopyStyle,Iconic 80s comedy,8,13 January 2014,"The Griswold family (Chevy Chase, Beverly D'Angelo, Anthony Michael Hall, Dana Barron) from Chicago is driving cross-country to the Walley World theme park.It starts off with a great happy vibe with the song Holiday Road by Lindsey Buckingham. Director Harold Ramis and writer John Hughes have created one of the iconic comedies from the 80s. This was when Chevy Chase still has his likability and not overstayed his welcome. This is undeniably Chevy's best movie. The three creates a goofy silly comedy deserving of the National Lampoon moniker. The comedy is broad. There are black stereotypes. Beverly flashes her boobs. It's college humor of the times.I do have to say that I didn't realize that Jane Krakowski was the first Cousin Vicki. It's been awhile since I saw this back in the day and she was a nobody. I still laugh at the french kissing joke. Cousin Eddie and his inappropriate family is where this movie starts to get interesting. The ridiculous problems keep mounting, and the jokes keep coming.",National Lampoon's Vacation
3,Prismark10,National Lampoon's Vacation,7,27 September 2021,"I have seen National Lampoon's Vacation several times over the years. My recent watch was an unedited version which contained nudity and swear words.Watching the uncensored version actually made the movie funnier.Clark Griswold (Chevy Chase) is the suburbanite who takes his wife Ellen (Beverly D'Angelo) and their son Rusty (Anthony Michael Hall) and their daughter Audrey (Dana Barron) to a family road trip from Chicago to Walley World theme park in California.The trouble is Clark is well meaning but rather dim. Maybe he should had flown as his wife suggested.Clark is fleeced before the trip starts by the car salesman. He gets fleeced along the way when he gets lost and when his car needs fixing by mechanics.During a visit to see Ellen's cousin, Clark gets lumbered with elderly Aunt Edna (Imogene Coca) and her dog. The trouble never stops even after the family reach the theme park.Directed by Harold Ramis and written by John Hughes. It contains the gross humour carried on from movies such as Animal House and Caddyshack.Some of the humour is a bit hit and miss. There is no denying that there are several good laughs in the movie.There are cameos from actors like John Candy, Eddie Bracken, Eugene Levy and Christie Brinkley as the flirty lady in a fast red car. Randy Quaid is grasping cousin Eddie. A young Jane Krakowski is the cousin who learned how to French kiss by her dad!",National Lampoon's Vacation
4,mark.waltz,"Pop always pays, and if stupidity had a price tag, Clark Griswold would be a zillionaire!",6,11 January 2021,"If b.s. was music, Clark Griswold would be a one man band, and in the first of four films in which Chevy Chase starred as the king braggart, he plays this role to perfection. In other hands, the part would be really obnoxious and difficult to tolerate, but Chase seems to be winking at the audience with the knowledge that he's going to get into big trouble and his wife, Beverly D'Angelo, will be the one to constantly bail him out.Wanting to give his family the best vacation ever, Chevy takes them cross-country from Chicago to California with the hopes of getting to Wally World unscathed. When you are a jerk like clark, that goal is going to be impossible to reach because his antics gets him into constant trouble whether for asking directions in St. Louis in the wrong area to be stuck in or dealing with a distant relative played by legendary comic Imogene Coca.With their son and daughter doing nothing but fighting all the way and Coca's Aunt Edna complaining, Chase and D'Angelo have a lot on their plate, but it's the ever patient D'Angelo who turns out to be the voice of reason even though you can tell with her eye rolls she wants to bash her husband over the head. then there's a Twist when they actually get to Wally world, having followed such antics as the fate of Aunt Edna's dog and Edna herself.There's also the presence of Christie Brinkley as a gorgeous woman flirting with Chase along the way, but anybody with a life like D'Angelo would be a fool to cheat on her. She shows off a gorgeous figure which along with her sparkling personality defies any temptation to fool around, that is unless you're an idiot like Clark.This could have easily have been a very dark comedy that ended up being unlikable because Clark certainly is, but the way it is written and the way it is acted and filmed, he is fun to despise and laugh at. Chase is letter perfect as he reacts to everything going on around him.Check out Clark's antique computer which maps out their trip, interfered with by the kid's pac-man game. Cameos by Randy Quaid, John Candy and Eddie Bracken, along with early appearances by Anthony Michael Hall (originating the role of Rusty who had his own trip to Wally World 34 years later) and Jane Krakowski makes for a fun ride even if the park is closed.",National Lampoon's Vacation
5,claudio_carvalho,Hilarious Road Movie,7,12 January 2015,"In Illinois, Chicago, the suburban Clark Griswold (Chevy Chase) decides to travel on vacation with his wife Ellen (Beverly D'Angelo) and their son Rusty (Anthony Michael Hall) and their daughter Audrey (Dana Barron) driving his new station wagon to the Walley World theme park in California. Ellen and the children suggest that they fly to the destination, but the stubborn Clark wants to spend more time with his family and say no to the proposed airplane travel.The Griswold family has many problems along their journey and they visit Ellen's cousin Catherine (Miriam Flynn), her useless husband Eddie (Randy Quaid) and their children. When they leave the place, they are forced to give a ride to the inconvenient Aunt Edna (Imogene Coca) and her hateful dog. Soon Clark learns that his planned journey has become a trip from hell.""Vacation"" is a hilarious road movie that makes anyone laughs. The clumsy Clark Griswold provokes very funny situations with his attitudes, supported by his beautiful wife. Unfortunately this type of naive comedy is forgotten by the studios on the present days. My vote is seven.Title (Brazil): ""Férias Frustradas"" (""Frustrated Vacation"")",National Lampoon's Vacation
6,lee_eisenberg,I guess that everyone is doomed to experience this sooner or later!,10,1 August 2005,"With ""National Lampoon's Vacation"", Chevy Chase did what may have been his funniest role ever. As all-American dad Clark Griswold, he, his wife Ellen (Beverly D'Angelo) and their two children have a miserable time while driving from Chicago to theme park Walley World. Probably the funniest scenes are the mishap in Arizona, Clark's peccadillo in the motel, and the grand finale. Some great supporting moments come from Imogene Coca as crotchety Aunt Edna, Randy Quaid as obnoxious Cousin Eddie, Christie Brinkley as a woman who catches Clark's eye (and then some) and John Candy as a security guard. There quite literally isn't a dull moment anywhere in the movie.",National Lampoon's Vacation
7,jboothmillard,National Lampoon's Vacation,6,3 January 2018,"I'd always heard about the National Lampoon movies, spin-offs from the original magazine, I'd seen Animal House, but I'd never seen Vacation movies, so I started from the beginning, written by John Hughes (The Breakfast Club, Ferris Bueller's Day Off, Home Alone, Beethoven), directed by Harold Ramis (Caddyshack, Groundhog Day, Analyze This, Bedazzled). Basically Chicago food chemist Clark Griswold (Chevy Chase) wants to spend quality time with his wife Ellen (Beverly D'Angelo) and children, son Rusty (Anthony Michael Hall) and daughter Audrey Griswold (Dana Barron). Clark decides to lead the family on a cross-country expedition, travelling from the suburbs of Chicago to southern California, to ""America's Favorite Family Fun Park"", amusement park Walley World. Ellen wants to fly, but Clark insists on driving, so he can bond with his family, he has ordered a new car in preparation for the trip, but the Salesman (Eugene Levy) says it will not be ready for six weeks. As Clark has already traded the car he brought, and it has already been hauled away and crushed, he is forced to accept a Wagon Queen Family Truckster, an ugly, out-sized station wagon. During the trip, the Griswolds experience several mishaps, including being tagged by vandals in St. Louis, and Clark is continually tantalised by a beautiful young woman (Christie Brinkley) driving a flashy red 1983 Ferrari. They stop in Coolidge, Kansas to visit Ellen's cousin Catherine (Miriam Flynn) and her husband Eddie (Randy Quaid), they ask the Griswolds to drop off cranky Aunt Edna (Imogene Coca) and her mean dog Dinky at her son's home in Phoenix, they reluctantly agree. The family stop in Colorado for the night at a decrepit and dirty campground, Clark forgets to untie the dog's leash from the car bumper, and in the morning unintentionally kills Dinky, a state trooper lectures Clark on animal cruelty, and Edna becomes irate. Ellen loses her bag after they leave Colorado, forcing Clark to have to cash a check for future payment, Clark and Ellen argue in the car, then they crash somewhere between Utah and Arizona, they are stranded in the desert. Clark sets off alone to find help, unaware that the rest of the family have been rescued by a passing mechanic, they reunite, and the mechanic extorts the rest of Clark's cash to repair the car, which is barely operational. They are frustrated and stop at the Grand Canyon, Clark is unable to convince a clerk at a hotel to cash a personal check, because his card was reported stolen, so Clarks takes from the cash register behind the clerk's back and leaves the check. Back on the road, the family find out that Aunt Edna has passed away in her sleep, they wrap her body in tarpaulin and tie her to the roof of the car, they reach Norman's house, but discover he is out of town, so they leave Edna's body at the back door. Ellen and the children have had enough of the road trip and the numerous mishaps, they want to go home, but Clark has become obsessed with reaching Walley World, they carry on. Ellen and Clark have another argument, he goes to a hotel bar, there he finally meets the Ferrari-driving blonde beauty, she invites him to go skinny-dipping with her in the pool, but the family discover them before anything else can happen, Ellen forgives Clark, and the couple goes skinny-dipping as well. Despite the many misfortunes, the family finally arrive at the theme park, only to find it is closed for the next two weeks for repairs, causing Clark to finally slip into madness, he buys a realistic-looking BB gun, and demands park security guard Russ Lasky (John Candy) take the family through Walley World. While Clark, Ellen, the kids and Russ ride the various roller coasters and rides, an LAPD SWAT have been called, along with park owner Roy Walley (Home Alone 2's Eddie Bracken), but Roy understands Clark's impassioned longing for a perfect vacation, he decides not press charges, Roy allows the Griswolds to enjoy the park, along with the SWAT team. Also starring James Keach as Motorcycle Cop, Licence to Kill's Frank McRae as Grover, Jane Krakowski as Cousin Vicki and Henry Gibson as Hotel Clerk. Chase is terrific as the accident-prone father who will do whatever it takes to reach the destination, no matter how insane, D'Angelo is good support as his tested wife, and there are memorable scenes with Candy, Levy and Brinkley. It is a simple premise, a road movie gone wrong, with various slapstick disaster moments, it is most funny to see how far the dad goes as he slowly cracks, and the silliness is well-paced, this is always considered as the best in the Vacation series, understandably so, a fun comedy. Good!",National Lampoon's Vacation
8,moonspinner55,Surprisingly benign comedy occasionally spiked with toilet humor...,5,15 October 2006,"Chevy Chase excels as bland suburban family man Clark Griswold, high on taking his family on a cross-country vacation by car. Their ultimate destination: Walley World. A touchstone movie for many viewers growing up in the '80s, ""Vacation"" is probably more funny and outrageous in retrospect than the actual film itself. Episodes with gross cousin Eddie and cantankerous Aunt Edna don't really build much comic momentum at the time, but the wobbly jokes have a sneaky way of catching up to you after the movie's over. Hurt overall by a tame final reel (apparently the result of some hasty re-shooting), the tone of the picture is sweetly banal, and if not for some R-rated gags it would be the perfect family comedy. Followed by a bushel of sequels, none of which equaled the nimble comedic touches of this first installment. ** from ****",National Lampoon's Vacation
9,paul_haakonsen,"Clark, what are you doing?...",7,9 June 2018,"First and foremost I must just say that there is something timeless about this comedy, and even when watched today the movie stands on its own and holds its ground.It is a mixture of many different things that come together and make ""National Lampoon's Vacation"" work out so nicely, such as the directing by Harold Ramis, the acting by the entire cast, and the entire storyline of course.The storyline is loaded with hilarious scenes and comedy, and it works out so nicely especially because the cast are so perfectly cast for the roles, and they each bring something very unique to the story. Chevy Chase and Beverly D'Angelo truly immortalized Clark and Ellen Griswold with their performances here in what was the start of a franchise of funny movies. It was also nice to have Randy Quaid as cousin Eddie here, especially knowing what a glorious return he will make in the ""National Lampoon's Christmas Vacation"" later on.There is a good amount of laughs to be had throughout the course of the movie, both from the blunt and in-your-face comedy, but definitely also from the more subtle jokes there is.""National Lampoon's Vacation"" is the type of comedy that you can watch again and again.",National Lampoon's Vacation
10,michaelRokeefe,Super comedy. Laugh riot.,8,14 June 2007,"A classic that never seems to get tiresome. The Griswald family, Clark(Chevy Chase), Ellen(Beverly D'Angelo), Rusty(Anthony Michael Hall) and Audrey(Dana Barron), are on the 'Holiday Road' cross-country from Chicago to ""Wally World"". Histerically funny sequences make the vacation one to remember. My favorites are: the sandwiches being drenched in dog ""pee""; Clark falling asleep at the wheel; the vibrating bed; and Aunt Edna(Imogene Cocoa)strapped to the top of the station wagon. Then there is the stop to visit dead beat Cousin Eddie(Randy Quaid). Harlod Ramis directs and co-writes.

12,Hey_Sweden,An 80s comedy classic.,8,30 August 2021,"The first in the series of ""Vacation"" comedies is just a blast from start to finish, with Chevy Chase in fine form as Clark W. Griswold, a dopey middle class family man from Chicago who's DETERMINED to bring his brood to California's famed Walley World theme park, and equally as determined to make the trip by car. As you can guess, just about everything goes wrong, with a series of escalating comedy crises.This viewer hadn't seen this movie in a long time, and then only on TV, so he hadn't realized this was actually rated R. A number of F bombs are dropped (and breasts revealed) in this gleefully silly movie (scripted by John Hughes) that sometimes revels in dark humor. And yet, it rarely goes for the actual gross-out. It gets a lot of mileage out of its variety of characters, including hick relative Cousin Eddie (Randy Quaid) and the crotchety Aunt Edna (Imogene Coca), whose ultimate fate is a real hoot. Some of the comedy talent appears only briefly, but it's nice to see so many familiar faces (John Candy, Eddie Bracken, Eugene Levy, Brian Doyle-Murray, Frank McRae, James Keach, Mickey Jones, John Diehl, Jane Krakowski, et al.) in one place. Beverly D'Angelo is a delight as the wife who tries her best to be patient, even as things spiral out of control. Christie Brinkley adds additional sex appeal as the mystery lady with whom Chase enjoys frequent flirtation. And Anthony Michael Hall & Dana Barron are appealing as the first incarnations of the Rusty & Audrey characters (who would keep getting recast in subsequent movies).""National Lampoon's Vacation"" gets down to business pretty quickly, and delivers a number of comedy highlights. Among them are the quirks seen in the cash-strapped Cousin Eddie family, the complaints of Aunt Edna, the various damage suffered by Clarks' station wagon, adventures in places like Dodge City, and the finale at Walley World, where the dedicated but sometimes irrational Clark refuses to accept disappointment. Of course, you can't completely blame him when the Griswold clan has come such a long way.Punctuated by the insidiously catchy Lindsey Buckingham tune ""Holiday Road"", ""National Lampoon's Vacation"" provides some good, hearty chuckles for a well-paced 98 minutes.Eight out of 10.",National Lampoon's Vacation
13,Bunuel1976,"NATIONAL LAMPOON'S VACATION (Harold Ramis, 1983) ***",7,24 January 2010,"This is the third ""National Lampoon"" entry I have watched after ANIMAL HOUSE (1978) and Christmas VACATION (1989), the latter being the second sequel to the film under review itself. I recall being lukewarm on both of them, but this VACATION proved altogether more satisfactory; incidentally, the fact that the late John Hughes scripted it came as no surprise since the same basic premise – a trip fraught by unforeseen calamities – would be re-used for his own effort PLANES, TRAINS AND AUTOMOBILES (1987), which I actually watched this Thanksgiving and for which John Candy (given a minor role here) was elevated to co-star status. Chevy Chase is the cheerful everyman taking his family on a cross-country holiday from Chicago to the fictitious Disney-like amusement park ""Walley World"" in L.A. His troubles begin straight away as he is handed the wrong brand of vehicle for the occasion; when they go to see the wife's backwoods relatives on the way, the latter dump their cantankerous old aunt on them whom they are to take home to Arizona. This section is certainly the more amusing, especially the woman and her pet dog's own separate fates; another recurring presence on the road is that of a girl driving a red sports-car who flirts with Chase, culminating with them taking a nude midnight dip in a motel pool. Somewhat predictably, when the family finally does make it to ""Walley World"", it is temporarily closed down for repairs: Chase really loses his cool here (following a couple of brief foul-mouthed outbursts en route) and he holds watchman Candy at gunpoint while the hero and his brood take all the fun rides – a desperate step which necessitates the intervention of not just the Police but the park's President in person (a welcome appearance by Eddie Bracken, naïve and bumbling lead of a couple of Preston Sturges comedy classics back in the 1940s)!",National Lampoon's Vacation
14,zardoz-13,A Funny Road Trip From Hell,9,30 July 2015,"Although Harold Ramis' R-rated road-trip ""National Lampoon's Vacation"" is a classic comedy of errors, it doesn't surpass ""National Lampoon's Christmas Vacation."" Indeed, ""National Lampoon's Christmas Vacation"" (1989) amounts to the best ""Vacation"" outing in the four film franchise. For the record, the 2003 sequel ""National Lampoon's Christmas Vacation 2"" was a made-for-television movie, so it doesn't properly belong to the cinematic canon. Ramis' rampantly funny, occasionally ribald farce about a dysfunctional middle-class family's cross-country journey from their suburban home in Chicago, Illinois, to the California-based theme-park Walley World benefits from a charismatic cast, fine performances, and gags galore. Some of the gags were rather racy for their day. The demise of Aunt Edna's dog Dinky and Aunt Edna's own death were probably interpreted as borderline tasteless. Released in 1983, ""National Lampoon's Vacation"" appears dated now in some respects. Meanwhile, the 2015 reboot with Ed Helms and Christina Applegate makes it look comparably tame. The video games that Clark Griswold's children play with look primitive, too. Nevertheless, any comedy toplining Chevy Chase cannot be a total loss, and this origins saga about the misadventures of the Griswold family will keep you in stitches.Irony and incongruity figure prominently in this comedy. Everything that can go wrong for the Griswold family does indeed go wrong. The destination that they set out for is Walley World. Of course, nobody at Disney would countenance anything that National Lampoon conjured up. Not only did THE John Hughes of ""Ferris Bueller's Day Off"" fame pen the screenplay, but also the same Hughes wrote the short story that National Lampoon magazine published in its the September 1979 issue. For the record, ""Vacation"" was Ramis' sophomore effort after ""Caddyshack."" This also served as Christie Brinkley's cinematic debut; she is cast as an enigmatic blonde who seems to be stalking Clark. Happily, Ramis doesn't shove the comedy down your throat and Beverly De Angelo and Chase maintain straight faces throughout the hilarity. Some genuinely understated moments of mirth occur that you might overlook unless you have scrutinized the film. For example, in an early scene, watch the way Clark 'Sparky' Griswold (Chevy Chase) dries the dishes at home for his wife without washing them. The Griswolds go through Hell literally to get to Walley World. Naturally, when they show up at the world renowned theme park, they discover that it is closed for two weeks, so Clark brandishes a gun and forces the security guard (John Candy) to take them on a roller-coaster ride from Hell. ""National Lampoon's Vacation"" consists primarily of a series of incidents strung together as the family travels by station wagon across country. At one point, they pick up a cantankerous relative, Aunt Edna (Imogene Coca of ""Under the Yum Yum Tree""), and she dies midway through the journey. The Griswolds are as elated to rid themselves of her (they leave her under an umbrella in a relative's backyard during a downpour) as they are saddened to lose Aunt Edna's pugnacious dog. Indeed, Clark gets pulled over by a grim cop (James Keach of ""The Long Riders""), who asks him about the canine leash attached to his rear bumper. Everybody who has seen this vintage comedy should remember Christie Brinkley in the convertible red Ferrari that catches Clark's attention. After several glimpses of each other on the highway, they hook up in a motel swimming pool, but the ecstasy of the moment is ephemeral. Naturally, Clarks' long-suffering wife Ellen (Beverly D'Angelo of ""Every Which Way But Loose"") forgives him for his flirtatious swimming pool dalliance. Later, she plunges into the pool naked (unlike the more discrete Brinkley), and Clark joins her. Ramis and Hughes set the tone for this tongue-in-cheek comedy from the start when Clark pulls into the car dealership to pick up his new vehicle. The shady car salesman (Eugene Levy) doesn't have the car that Clark ordered. Clark wanted an Antarctic Blue Super Sports Wagon with a CB and an optional rally fun pack. Instead, he winds up stuck with a Metallic Pea-Green Wagon-Queen Family Truckster that resembles an armored car with the gas cap on the hood. By the time they convince the car dealer that they want their original station wagon back, the dealer has smashed it up. Most of the comedy is standard stuff, and Clark is an eccentric fool. Eddie Bracken, Bryan-Doyle Murray, John Candy, and Eugene Levy make memorable cameos. Nevertheless, the Griswolds are a sympathetic but half-witted family. ""National Lampoon's Vacation"" is a good comedy, but it isn't strictly a memorable, Hall of Fame epic.",National Lampoon's Vacation
15,evanston_dad,Here Come the Griswolds,7,14 February 2008,"One of those movies you always remember as being better than it actually is.""Vacation"" tells the story of Clark Griswold (Chevy Chase) leading his family across country on one of those most dreaded of dreaded events -- the Family Vacation! It's episodic in nature, moving briskly from one disaster to another, some of them very funny (the death of a miserable aunt played by Imogen Coca is a highlight) to the downright disturbing (a brief stay with some incestuous hillbilly relatives). Some scenes deliver bigger laughs than others, but none of them sticks around for very long, so even the dead parts move by fairly quickly.Having been on a cross-country drive myself with my family when I was a kid (from Illinios to California) to go to Disneyland, let's just say I could easily relate to this film.Beverly D'Angelo is smokin' hot as Chase's wife, and a young Anthony Michael Hall is hilarious as his adolescent son.Grade: B",National Lampoon's Vacation

To make the vacation even more memorable, rather than taking them by airplane he decides to take the new family car so that they can enjoy the sights along the way. The problem is that Chris hasn't thought out the road trip nearly as much as he should have and as a result the entire family has to endure one disaster after another along the way. Now rather than reveal any more I will just say that this was an okay comedy which contained decent performances by both Beverly D'Angelo (as Chris' wife ""Ellen Griswold"") along with the aforementioned Chevy Chase. I also liked the scenes involving John Candy (as Security Guard ""Russ Laskey"") and Christie Brinkley (as the beautiful woman in the Red Ferrari).

But Clark promised his beloved family the best vacation ever...With Clark Griswold, and Fletch, Chase had two of the funniest characters in the early eighties, and this movie has to be the best movie Chase has ever made. No matter which version you have seen, edited, the one with the Pointer Sisters in the blondes car, or the one with profanity, it never fails to raise a laugh.Standalone, the plot is simple and generic, the family are going on holiday, plain and simple. But what happens in between is the filling, and the filling is goo-oood (as Eddie would say), and they play like different sketches.Chase is deadpan throughout, and always manages to keep Clark utterly serious, even when he loses the plot at the end, and the support is fantastic.Other comedies have tried to emulate the comedy road movie, but they end up having gross out gags, because they don't have the genius writers behind this movie.A classic eighties movie, still funny today.",National Lampoon's Vacation
19,Aaron1375,"A rather good vacation for you the viewer, not so much for the Griswalds.",9,30 November 2008,"Yes, the classic road trip movie and one of the best as far as comedy road trip movies. This is the first of four vacation type movies and is easily the best, granted I never saw the one in Vegas. This one just seems the most realistic, granted I am doubting all the things that happened here could happen on one trip, but still I am sure these things have happened before on family trips. So the story in this one? Simple, the Griswalds are going on a cross country trip to Wally World and plan on taking in the sights of America along the way. What could be more fun? They even stop at some relatives house and get to take on another traveler in the form of a delightful aunt. Yes, this movie is very funny and you just have to cringe at all the stuff that goes wrong on Clark's (Chevy Chase) perfectly planned trip as things go wrong right from the get go as the vehicle they planned on driving gets replaced by a rather crappy station wagon. The cast is great as Chevy is in prime form and Beverly DeAngelo is perfectly cast as his wife. The kids in this one are the best of the movies I have seen in the vacation series and Randy Quaid is excellent as cousin Eddie. We all have that relative hiding in the wings don't we? The trip seems to go from one disaster to the next, and while it is terrible what they have to go through it is still worth a lot of laughs. Many people I am sure have driven into the bad part of town on accident, driven through that detour sign, and had run ins with the local law enforcement. Granted, I am also sure not many have found themselves in the middle of a desert, flirting with a beautiful modelesque lady, and had to use a BB gun to get into a park.

21,SimonJack,The first Vacation film still has some laughs,7,21 February 2021,"Watching ""National Lampoon's Vacation"" again after many years, one can still smile and have some good laughs. But this is an adventure comedy that was much funnier the first time - around the time of its 1983 release. It's not that the comedy itself is dated, but the subject - a family going on a hectic vacation with one foible after another just isn't as funny well into the 21st century as it was two decades before the century change.All of the cast are good. This turned out to be the first of three films that National Lampoon and Warner Brothers would make about vacations, built around the Clark and Ellen Griswold family. The children change in each of the three films, and only Chevy Chase and Beverly D'Angelo are in all three films. This one was a big box office hit, finishing the year 10th in ticket sales of $61.4 million.The film has some nice scenery. But, for all the Griswold's road travels from Chicago to Wally World near Los Angeles, the bulk of the filming was done in multiple locations in three states - Colorado, Arizona and California. The road accident scene was shot in Monument Valley, Utah. How they got so far off their main road to wind up there is unbelievably humorous in itself.My favorite line in the whole film is when the highway patrolman stops them and asks to see Clark's drivers license. Aunt Edna, in the back seat, says, ""He shouldn't even have a license to drive an automobile. He should be behind bars.""The R-rating for the film is a heads up that it's not a family film, but mostly for mature adults.",National Lampoon's Vacation

25,StevePulaski,The feel good movie of the eighties,9,14 July 2011,"If there is one movie that is one of the all-time feel good movies it's definitely National Lampoon's Vacation. It's a work of comedy gold as the lead character, the iconic Clark Griswold (Chase), tries simply to give his family a successful and fun vacation. It turns into a problematic joy ride that rarely lets up.Everyone has a Clark Griswold. He's a charming guy, great smile, calm tone, and a wish to make everyone happy. Clark is married to his wonderful wife Ellen (D'Angelo), and has two kids Rusty (Michael Hall) and Audrey (Barron) who would later become America's family in the three sequels. Clark and his family want to go to Wally World to see Marty Moose and spend some quality family time. But so much goes wrong it sends them into a downward spiral into insanity.What happens, I won't spoil. Many have seen it, but it's not fun reading about their antics. Watching them on a Television is so much funnier and the right way to do it. The fact that the characters are so desperate for one simple thing, but can't get to it is hilarious. The characters aren't laughing at what happens which is good. They shouldn't feel like they're putting on a show for us. They are concerned about their well being, not if the audience is laughing.The family is fun and well developed. I appreciate every actor who played both Rusty and Audrey and found them to be fit and capable of pulling the job off. As for Clark and Ellen, by the second movie they proved to us they were irreplaceable. Chevy Chase can't be replaced, neither can Beverly D'Angelo. It's just not possible.I've always had a place in my heart for the Wally World Scene. It is arguably John Candy's funniest and most memorable role in movie history next to Planes, Trains, and Automobiles. Not to mention, Clark's unexpected yet hilarious outbursts are always something to look forward to in the series.Followed up by two decent sequels, and a hilarious and underrated closure that is Vegas Vacation, the Vacation franchise is forever etched into my heart as a work of comedy genius. It's not only a brilliantly crafted, but it is the poster child for how to make a successful comedy. Don't act like you're putting on a show for somebody, act natural and act how you would if it were real.Starring: Chevy Chase, Beverly D'Angelo, Anthony Michael Hall, Dana Barron, Randy Quaid, Eugene Levy, and John Candy. Directed by: Harold Ramis.",National Lampoon's Vacation
26,Smells_Like_Cheese,"Without a doubt, Chevy Chase's best work!",10,13 August 2005,"""Vacation"", what a hysterical laugh out loud till you hurt movie! I was watching the wonderful ""I love the 80's"" on VH1, and they showed this movie. I remember watching it when I was younger, but I didn't get much of it obviously. So, I watched it again, because it looked more appealing than it did when I was a kid.God, I never laughed so hard in my life. Chevy Chase, Clark Griswald decides that he is not spending enough time with the kids, so he has planned a cross road trip with the family to see their favorite cartoon character theme park ""Marty Moose!"" and ""Wally World!"". Back on the old holiday road, it's not going to be easy. Visiting their hick cousin, Eddie and his scary hillbilly family and putting their grumpy old aunt on the trip with the Griswalds. Clark has a mysterious but extremely sexy girl, Christie Brinkly, following him around in a red hot Ferrari. Their car is constantly getting into accidents and dents on the way to California. Finally, after to the point of madness, Clark will kill every person if he has to to get to Wally World.If you loved ""Vacation"", I highly recommend ""Christmas Vacation"" as well. I think the reason why we all love this movie is because we can relate in some way. How many of us go on vacation and nothing goes perfect? I loved the ending of this movie so much! I won't give it away, but trust me that it is that good. If you've seen it, I'm sure you will agree that this is a must see comedy.10/10-highly deserved!",National Lampoon's Vacation
27,MovieAddict2016,"How To Make A Timeless, Original, Hysterical, Satirical Comedy.",10,17 January 2003,"Every summer Chevy Chase takes his family on a little trip. This year he went too far.  Chevy Chase stars as Clark Griswold, the typical American businessman. Well, almost a basic businessman. He works in food preservatives. Beverly D'Angelo plays his wife, Anthony Michael Hall plays Rusty, his teenage son, and Dana Barron plays his daughter Audrey . This summer, Clark has decided to go all out and take a vacation with his family to ""Walley World,"" a theme park spoof on Disney World, owned by ""Roy Walley"".Basically, this film starts out strong and ends strong. There are many gut grabbing scenes, and the film never resorts to gross out humor. The biggest gross out is when Clark bites into a sandwich a dog leaked on, but that's a different story.Along the way to Walley World, everything and everything that can go wrong does, and Clark ends up with Aunt Edna (Imogene Coca), who adds more fun to this wallop of a comedy.The laughter just escalates more and more as we see Clark's dreams flush down the toilet farther and farther, and I can't tell you how much I laughed at some of the scenes.""Vacation"" isn't typical National Lampoon fare.Chevy Chase gives by far his best performance (akthough he acts just as well in ""Christmas Vacation"") as Clark, a real optimist, go get'm kind of guy, who completely snaps toward the end of the film. The rest of the cast does well, and Beverly D'Angelo does surprisingly well as a house wife. The two children, Audrey and Rusy, squawk at each other, but not to the point of obnoxious, which is another good thing about this film.Is it no surprise that John Hughes, the king writer/director of the 80's comedy films wrote this, or that Harold Ramis (Groundhog Day, Ghostbusters, Striped, Analyze This) directed the film? With cameos by the likes of John Candy, Eugene Levy, Brian Doyle Murray (who played Clark's boss in ""Christmas Vacation""), and more, ""Vacation"" is a comedic triumph of the eighties that is now an icon of how to make a good comedy.4.5/5 stars --John Ulmer",National Lampoon's Vacation
28,DKosty123,Lots of Laughs,8,16 May 2007,"Step right up with the Griswold family, & go on a trip to Wally World to see Roy Wally & his cast at a fantastic theme park in California. Yes, this is a thinly disguised family trip to Disneyland. It's a lot funnier though when you put Director Harol Ramis (Ghostbusters, Ground Hog Day) together with Clark (Chevy Chase) Griswold & his assorted family & characters.Clark sets up a vacation in which everything goes wrong on the way. The material is so funny that it's theme & jokes are borrowed in 2006 film LITTLE MISS SUNSHINE and won an Academy Award for best original script. Does this mean that this film would win the award for that if it came out last year? The trip in this film & the borrowing of it reminds me most of when the Griswolds have an accident that disables the car & the guys at the small town garage charge Clark (my favorite Clark Griswold quote) ""$450 dollars for 4 bald tires & a tow."" The film also addresses every middle aged married mans fantasy of being hit on by a drop dead gorgeous 20+ year old blonde that is built like a dream while also having a foxy little blonde wife too.I wouldn't mind doing stupid things myself to wind up in Clarks shoes. Of course he might be smart enough to take advantage of the situation or maybe not.

Nothing unusual about a mom and a dad with their kids going on a vacation and stopping off to visit relatives along the way to their planned destination. But if your parents are Clark (Chase) and Ellen (D'Angelo) Griswold then you are in for a comical vacation.

31,sddavis63,"The Sequels Were Better, But You Have To Appreciate That This Is Where The Griswolds Began",6,22 August 2010,"When you have some time to waste, any of the movies in the National Lampoon ""Vacation"" series is worth killing some time with. Chevy Chase knew the part of Clark Griswold and always managed to capture the character bang-on. Beverley D'Angelo as his long-suffering wife Ellen also hit the ground running in her first stab at the character. (I was a bit surprised to see her do two topless scenes in this - one fairly close-up in the shower, the other from a distance at the hotel pool.) As far as I know, Chase and D'Angelo are the only actors to have been in all 4 movies. This initial chapter in the series spawned three sequels (European Vacation, Christmas Vacation and Vegas Vacation.) Of the four in the series I have to say that my favourite (for various reasons) was Christmas Vacation. Interestingly, given that sequels tend to go on a downward spiral in terms of quality, I thought this initial chapter was perhaps the weakest of the four movies - still good for a laugh, but not as funny as the others (certainly I'd rank ""Christmas"" and ""Vegas"" ahead of it.)Here, Clark decides to take his family (somewhat against their will) on a drive from Chicago to California to go to ""Walley World"" - a National Lampoon spoof on the Disney World theme parks. They have the assorted adventures along the way that you expect, including the requisite time spent with Cousin Eddy (Randy Quaid) and his family - cousin Eddy is always one of my favourite characters in the series. It's good fun. What weakened it (in my opinion at least) was that Clark seemed less lovable (if you will) in this movie. Maybe it was just the way that the character evolved, but in his initial outing he seems harder, he spews a lot of foul language (even in front of his kids) and there are a number of scenes where he just doesn't seem like the Clark Griswold who appears in the later movies. There were also too many unnecessary characters (or, at least, characters whose place went on far too long.) I didn't care for Aunt Edna. I thought Christie Brinkley's unnamed character was humorous for one scene, but she kept appearing everywhere the Griswold's went - she started to seem as creepy as a stalker after a while. And John Candy's security guard at Walley World was too over the top. He wasn't a believable character at all - and watching the Griswold's ride the roller coasters with him got really old really fast.So, this is my least favourite of the ""Vacation"" series. I can't be too hard on it though. It spawned three very funny sequels, and for whatever shortcomings it may have it still packs a few laughs of its own.",National Lampoon's Vacation
32,thesar-2,Who's Stalking Whom?,5,19 July 2015,"I never got to see this when it came out in 1983, and it wasn't until years following many viewings of Christmas Vacation that I finally saw it. At that time, I did like it but this past weekit just didn't hold up. Some of it was funny, namely the Cousin Eddie scenes and ones that stuck close to my heart, such as getting lost in St. Louis and ending up in the BAD side of town. That totally happened to me, though we made it out unlike the Griswolds. I know this is an unrealistic comedy (the one shot of Phoenix, and it's raining??), but the rides running themselves in the finaleI just couldn't get past. Overall, it's not bad, had one of the best movies songs ever: Holiday Road, and still has some iconic and hilarious scenes – dog leash/urine, still funny.",National Lampoon's Vacation
33,bowmanblue,Still the best,9,17 October 2019,"'National Lampoon's Vacation' runs for about an hour and a half. And, in my opinion, take any five minute segment from the film and there's possibly more laughs contained within compared to any modern 'comedy' movie from mainstream Hollywood. It's that good. Also - and possibly better still - it's aged perfectly and is as good today as it ever was.Like many films in the eighties, we're thrown right into the action (compared to today's movies where it seems film-makers want to spend most of the movie 'getting to know' the characters, rather than moving the story forward). We meet married father of two 'Clark Griswold' (Chevy Chase) preparing to drive his family across country from Chicago to California on a pilgrimage to a fictional theme park 'Wally World' (basically Disney World for all intents and purposes). What follows is a road movie where the family get into one scrape after the next.There's nothing too inspired for the plot. However, it's simply so funny that whatever it lacks in 'story depth' it makes up for great fun and the desire to see this bunch of characters succeed in their - supposedly easy - quest.All the other characters play their parts (special mention to Randy Quaid and John Candy, who are - naturally - as great as ever), but 'National Lampoon's Vacation' is Chevy Chase's show and he steals every scene there is with his madcap (but strangely lovable) antics. The 'sandwich-dance' scene is still priceless!For some reason 'National Lampoon's Vacation' never made it from my VHS collection to my DVD collection and I've only just seen it in many years. I couldn't believe how 'timeless' it is. If you're okay with some of the eighties haircuts, everything in the film could be shot today (okay, so the kids play portable tabletop video games rather than with an iphone, but apart from that...). And that's what makes the film so great - it's held up after all those years and still a total comedy gem that everyone who wants a laugh should see.That's my review, but if you did want a contrary opinion, my mum didn't like the film because she found Chevy Chase 'too annoying.' So I guess it's not for everyone after all.",National Lampoon's Vacation

His long-suffering wife Ellen wants to fly, but Clark would rather drive and spend time with the kids he hardly ever sees.Sounds like a simple journey from A to B right? Wrong! The Griswolds are a gene pool of absolute disaster and nothing...NOTHING goes right...ever. The fun begins with Clark being forced to accept a disgusting metallic pea-green family truckster instead of a cool-blue sports model with CB and optional fun pack. It's literally the most hideous car in the history of automobiles (and that includes the car that Homer Simpson made for his brother Herb).As the lengthy days on the road pass, Clark is ripped-off by street hustlers, guilt-tripped out of $500 from his hick cousin Eddie (Randy Quaid in what is, begrudgingly, his most popular role), ripped-off by a hick sheriff/mechanic, and tempted by gorgeous blonde in a Ferrari. Though Ellen doesn't take kindly to anyone with an eye on her Sparky (actually D'Angelo's pet name for Chevy Chase and not something that was scripted).Based on John Hughes' ill-fated trip to Disneyworld when he was five-years-old, Vacation brought us Chevy Chase's most famous character (sorry Fletch) and most successful series. He has absolutely perfect chemistry with Beverly D'Angelo, who, with her large eyeballs and perfect timing, is an under-rated comic actress in her own right.While I absolutely love the first and third movies in the Vacation series, and both definitely score 10/10, I have to say the original is the best as it has a really dark edge that none of the others have. There's virtually nothing in Vacation that isn't funny. Harold Ramis, fresh off the absolute anarchy of Caddyshack, keeps a tight, sadistic reign on the disastrous road trip. If you have a dark sense of humor and enjoy evil comedy then you'll love Vacation. It was one of the first movies I ever saw and it helped turn me into the misanthropic, dysfunctional, ghoulish misfit that I am today.Thank you, Vacation! Thank you!",National Lampoon's Vacation

Beverly D'Angelo is cute as a button here. I thought she was really good. Anthony Michael Hall & Dana Barron are both great as the kids, especially Michael Hall. Randy Quaid is a show stealer.

Well, this is a part of my quest to try and watch as many of the movies from my younger years as possible, even though it turned out not to be that great,Yeah, I remember it quite well, though it certainly did take rewatching it to finally remember what happened. Basically it is a story about a family, the Griswalds, who decide to travel across the United States from Chicago to California to go and visit Wally World. Yeah, it's actually supposed to be Disneyland, but I suspect that National Lampoon (which was a magazine) wasn't able to get the rights for it, which isn't all that surprising.Well, as with a lot of these road movies, the thing is that pretty much everything goes wrong, right from the start where the used car dealer hoists a dodgy station wagon onto the Griswalds. Mind you, they are pictured as just being a normal family, it is just that they end up in an extraordinary situation. Another thing is that it is a pretty long journey, so there is always the perchance that something is going to go wrong.As I mentioned, I'm not actually a particularly big fan of the film, though because it has been absolutely ages since I last watched it, I did want to give it a shot again. Well, it certainly hasn't changed my impression of it. I didn't find it funny back then, and I certainly don't find it funny now.

Clark is a spineless worm of a man who deary loves his family. He is a gullible idiot who lacks the backbone to stand up for himself, until he absolutely cracks. He takes and takes until he little mind just can't take it anymore and then he goes completely nuts.This, the first in a small series of ""Vacation"" movies, is the most successful endeavor. While the sequels are each enjoyable, they lack the care that went into the making of this first installment.There are quite a few moments which have you rolling your eyes and cringing inwardly, but the campy humor never ceases to entertain.Driving across the country with two children in the back seat is an arduous enough task without having Clark W. Grizwold at the helm. He is almost flagitious in his determination to have fun. On their way to ""Wally World,"" to see ""Marty Moose,"" anything that can go wrong, does.Stopping for obvious tourist attractions such as the ""House of Mud,"" surely does nothing to help this trip. And neither does the little blonde in the red sports car, who distracts Clark so badly that he can barely keep himself contained.Equal to the bad choices and horrible distractions, is their visit with Cousin Eddie (Randy Quaid). From country losers who are obviously the white trash of the family, we get quotes like, ""I'm going steady and I french kiss."" ""So? Everybody does that."" ""Yeah, but Daddy says I'm the best at it."" and ""Dad taught me something really neat last year. Ever bop your bologna?"" and ""I don't know why they call this 'Hamburger Helper,' it does just fine all by itself."" Don't eat sandwiches during the scene just after they leave Cousin Eddie's house. You'll regret it. Just a heads-up. Although I must admit that Clark's solution to Aunt Edna's horrid little mutt was rather creative.I won't detail every scene in this movie, but you get the general idea.

The ensemble cast, speckled with cameos from several SCTV alums, elevates an already-rich premise into something even greater than the sum of its parts.

He's rationalizing why the family will drive from Illinois, instead of fly, to Wally World, a moose-centered family amusement park in California. What makes this film enjoyable is that the Griswolds are so typical of banal American suburban family values.Clark (Chevy Chase) is a good-natured sap, gullibly idealistic, and conforming. His meek wife (well played by Beverly D'Angelo) looks up to Clark. Their two teenage kids are dull blockheads, patterned after their dull parents. The boy wears ugly dental braces.Their mode of travel is a prehistoric, humorously ugly, putrid green station wagon with cheesy brown panels. The Griswolds blast off with unlimited optimism and good-natured anticipation of the fun they will have at Wally World. But the optimism gradually fades and is replaced by grim determination after a series of on-the-road disasters that make a mockery of idealism.The film's humor lies in its absurd plot situations, and in the dialogue. At a cookout, a down-on-his-luck Cousin Eddie (Randy Quaid) treats the Griswolds to backyard burgers, then remarks to Clark: ""I don't know why they call this stuff hamburger helper. It does just fine by itself"".Casting is appropriate. Overall acting trends humorously exaggerated, consistent with the satire. Performances by Imogene Coca and John Candy add to the comedy. The bouncy song ""Holiday Road"" opens the film with a series of vintage American postcards in tandem with the opening credits.My only reservation is that some of the plot contrivances are a bit over-the-top. The writers seem to be trying a little too hard.""Vacation"" is a satire on the banality of the traditional American summer ritual, and therefore thematically rich. Production values are fine. Though not perfect, this film is worth watching.",National Lampoon's Vacation

Unfortunately everything that can go wrong, does go wrong from driveway to carpark. The journey gives us numerous classic scenes that deliver brilliant visual comedy, situational comedy and hilarious dialogue.You probably need to be a Chevy Chase fan to truly appreciate the comedy. In his best movies I only have to see his face to start chuckling and this is one is no different. He's not everybody's cup of tea, so if you don't like him this might not be for you. Beverly D'Angelo, John Candy, Randy Quaid, Anthony Michael Hall, Dana Barron and James Keach are also excellent in support.My favourite part is when the family are so dejected by all the disasters that continually plague their journey they beg Clark to turn back. Just watch and listen to his reaction. For me this is one of the funniest moments in cinema history, because I'm sure we've all been on the verge of something similar with our own families at some point in life.Classic comedy featuring a great script from John Hughes, strong direction from Harold Ramis and a star turn from Chase.",National Lampoon's Vacation

The new version will no doubt be raunchier and dumber, but even if it were in competent hands, this film would be a hard one to top, even if it isn't perfect.Chevy Chase does a fantastic job depicting a family man, a loving husband and dad, who slowly loses his mind during a vacation. The humor is generally good, though there are a few bits which fall flat. The ending is priceless. John Candy may have limited screen time, but he is pure gold. Funny to think in a few years he would be playing the father driven mad during a vacation gone wrong in The Great Outdoors.Not really a classic, but still a lot of fun.",National Lampoon's Vacation

How comes we lost Hughes as a director, but Scorsese is unstoppable? Hughes was on to something; call it kitsch or otherwise, it did kick. In the '80s generation, Chase was my second favorite comedy actorafter Willis. Anthony Michael Hall was to become a Hughes stock actor. Have you seen the handsome Hall in Into the Sun (1992) ?

Since Clark thinks that he doesn't have any time with his family, he decides to take them in a vacation from Chicago to California. Clark and his family are going to Wally World!, a Disney-like theme park. Once they start on a road trip cross-country from their home turns into a complete disaster. Every state they cross, it's turns bad to worse. Especially when Clark is forced to drive his mean-spirited aunt Edna (Imogene Coca) to Pheonix, after visiting their odd-ball Cousin Eddie (Randy Quaid) and their family. Only thing that lifts Clark's spirits is a mysterious young woman (Christie Brinkley) that Clark's occasionally sees on the road, while she driving an red Ferrari.Directed by Harold Ramis (Bedazzled ""2000"", Caddyshack, Groundhog Day) made an enjoyable silly comedy with a dark edge. Chase appears in one of his best roles as a naive family man, who does his best with his family to have a fun time in the film. This was one of the most popular comedies of the 1980's and it went on to have three sequels. Which ""Christmas Vacation"" is the best of the four films. This has some great comedic lines, especially the scene where Chase has an nervous breakdown in the car after the death of a key character in the movie. This has an memorable use of Lindsey Buckingham's song ""Holiday Road"" in some scenes in the movie.The 20th anniversary DVD edition is good. DVD has an clean anamorphic Widescreen (1.78:1) transfer and an good Dolby 1.0 Mono Sound. The highlight of the DVD is the enjoyable audio commentary track by the director, producer Matty Simmons, actors:Chase, Quaid, Barron and Hall. It is interesting to hear them talk about the film, especially when they mention the original darker ending. Which sadly, it is not in the 20th anniversary edition. But it will probably see the light of day on a future Blu-ray release. DVD also has mini-featurettes, original theatrical trailer and introduction by Simmons, Chase & Quaid. This is one of Chase's best comedies and also one of Ramis' best movies as well. Quaid is a hoot in a small memorable role and as well for Brinkley as the girl of Griswold's dreams. Many familiar faces appears in cameos and bit-parts like the late John Candy, the late Eddie Bracken, Brain-Doyle Murray, Mirian Flynn, James Keach, Eugene Levy, Jane Krakowski and more. This is a terrible vacation not to be missed. Written by John Hughes (The Breakfest Club, Home Alone, Uncle Buck).

51,triple8,a combination of all things good and bad about comedies.,7,1 December 2003,"SPOILERS Through!Vacation, to me, is a good comedy that is a definite must view ONCE but it isn't a definite must see over and over. Although, I did enjoy it when it came out so very long ago, I don't think of this as the best comedy ever or love it to the extent many others do.Some of the jokes were very, very funny and the actual premise was GREAT!! A father takes his family on a road trip and along the way experiences-well-the good, the bad, the ugly-just about everything! Great premise for a fun movie and vacation WAS fun but it definitely had parts that were more crass then funny and I could see the multiple viewing thing grating on you after awhile.I agree with the IMDb user who mentioned te scene where the dog is dragged by the car was not necessary. But it wasn't just THAT one scene-many times the movie seemed to be trying for laughs through shock value. It wasn't necessary, the truly funny parts were the more subdued. The ""in your face"" vulgarity that frequently surfaced wasn't necessary to make this pic good and actually detracted from it, I thought. This was a movie that was sometimes HILARIOUS, sometimes merely funny, but other times somewhat crude. I still think it was a pretty funny comedy, if I met someone who hadn't seen it(don't know many) I 'd recommend they give it a viewing. But I don't think the movie's perfect by any means and have seen better comedies. One thing I'll mention is the ending which I LOVED!! That was a plus and in spite of all the things that go wrong, the family members are grounded in love and the ending makes that clear. Great ending and great cameo By Christie Brinkley(I actually found the whole Brinkley subplot to be one of the funnier things in the movie). And despite all the twists and turns of this family's incredible road trip it puts you in the mood for your own vacation! Definitely had both positives and negatives but a must see once.",National Lampoon's Vacation
52,Spleen,Mean-spirited and vile,3,1 February 2000,"It seems that I'm in a minority.  Yes, the film IS directed by Harold Ramis, who was responsible for the delightful `Groundhog Day'; and it was written by John Hughes, who wrote some pretty good scripts in the 1980s.  I'll even admit there are funny moments, although the only one which really gets me is the climax in Wally World. (It's a proper comic climax, I'll give it that.) But ... ... spoiler ahead ...I don't hold with cinematic cruelty to dogs.  Not that it can't be done funnily - see, for instance, `A Fish Called Wanda'.  But it ain't funny here.  The Griswolds tie a dog to the back of their car and drive off; later, they (and we) are only reminded of the dog when a policeman pulls them over for having killed it.  As I've described it the scene could yet be funny.  Instead it comes across as merely sick.  A nasty mind was at work here: the writing, like so much of the film's writing, is just plain tacky, something that makes us cringe while we think we're being amused.  Hughes doesn't even seem to be taking a joyous delight in stepping outside the bounds of good taste.  He drags out the scene in a leaden way until it cries out to the heavens to be finished and done with.  This is NOT black comedy, whatever else it is.  Black comedy is a wine: this is rather a shot of unadulterated gin which leaves a sour taste in your mouth and makes you feel as though you've been clubbed on the back of the head.There's poetic justice in the way `Vacation' has aged.  It takes such grim delight in making fun of its uncool and behind-the-times protagonists.  It now looks even more out of date than they do.",National Lampoon's Vacation
53,raulfaust,Refreshing,7,16 January 2014,"You know, this movie shows me the reasons why the 80's were so recognized in American industry as a whole. ""Vacation"" is a politically incorrect movie that deals with dedicated subjects, like father and mother trying to have sex while their children are asleep, young son learning to watch porn-- and consequently masturbate--, young daughter learning what is weed-- and probably how to smoke--, among others. I admit I felt a little shocked with such scenes, since they would NEVER be in a movie these days. You know, several people would feel offended by that and the movie would be too controversial to be popular, so nowadays' filmmakers prefer not to show people as they are. There are some creative scenes, like the pool one and the dying dog for accident, which proves this film HAS a black humor-- which is the funniest for some. For those who enjoy odontology, it's interesting to notice how Chevy Chase had some good teeth, despite the low quality technology they had in the 80's; also, it's fun to see how braces were different, comparing how they are nowadays.

Boneheaded, but well meaning father, Clark Griswold, driving his wife and two kids on a cross country family vacation, from Chicago to a California theme park, to spend time with all of them, before the kids are too old for such things. Needless to say, absolutely nothing goes according to plans: they got lost before even leaving Chicago. Their new car isn't what they had planned. They're saddled with driving an obnoxious aunt to Phoenix. They get lost in the Arizona desert, after visiting obnoxious, trailer trash in-laws, and then robbed by local hicks. All of these absurd, yet wholly possible, circumstances and occurrences pile up, yet Clark Griswold (Chase, in one of his funniest roles as the hapless, clueless father) is determined to have a good holiday with the family, even if it kills them. And a junkyard dog. And Aunt Edna. Beverly D'Angelo is equally good as the (sexy, but not overly) housewife who has enough disaster and wants to turn around and go home. Great score by Lindsay Buckingham also. The film is only let down a bit by the climax, when they actually get to the theme park, the laughs fizzle away. But, perhaps that was the filmmakers' intent?

I guess you could call this a timeless comedy, because the jokes in it still work today and will probably still work in 20 years time as well.In this movie we follow the Griswold family, Clark and Ellen and their two children Rusty and Audrey, as they prepare themselves to go on a trip cross-country from Chicago to the West Coast, where they will visit Walley World, a Disneyland-like theme park. Clark has prepared and planned down the trip to the last minute. But even before leaving they already encounter some problems and more will follow later during their trip, making this the vacation they will never forget...It's hard to say which part of the movie I liked most. I liked it all, the part where they get the new car, where they meet Ellen's relatives, when Clark flirts with a pretty young lady... It's just too hard to pick one. It's too bad they don't seem to make this kind of comedies anymore. Today's movie makers sure can learn something from this movie.

56,SusieSalmonLikeTheFish,Whatever happened to movies like this?,10,31 December 2014,"My grandfather showed my brother, sister and I the National Lampoon Christmas movie and ever since then we've been really into the series. Vacation is the latest one I've seen, featuring a parody of Disney World (Walley World) and a jerky but well-meaning man trying his best to drive his family across the country. Unfortunately they automatically fall into misfortune; their poor reliable old car is traded in to a sleazy dealership for a newer model and squashed flat, and the dealership sells them an inferior pea-green station wagon (not at all what they ordered). They make a pit stop at their redneck cousins' place, where a misfit family of hillbillies and farmers introduce Audrey Griswold to some rather disturbing lifestyles... Audrey is given a purse of weed and rolled joints from her cousin and learns about the family's inbreeding, and the Griswold family gets the surprise (and unwanted task) of driving their crabby old aunt Edna and her nasty dog with them in the backseat to be dropped off in Phoenix. As things usually go for the Griswold family, their bad luck can only get worse, providing a load of entertainment through the whole movie.My question is, what happened to movies like this? Vacation is a genuinely funny and entertaining movie. Most movies like this today are full of gross sex jokes and fart jokes (R.V. from 2006 for example). The families in movies today are silly, lazy and clones of everything trendy right now, leaving them hard to relate to, and the soundtrack for them is terrible. Vacation has very few sex jokes (the ones it does have are very subtle), no fart jokes, some swearing, but nothing that would take away from enjoying the movie the way movies today have become. The soundtrack to Vacation is so catchy and nostalgic (I wish music was as good today as t was back then), the family is just your average middle-class family, easy to relate to, and the acting was excellent (they even got John Candy to play a small role as the overweight security guard). Unlike most movies today, which rely on fart jokes to get laughs from their audiences, Vacation improvises with various antics that could happen to any family. If a time machine was invented right now, I'd gladly pack my bags and go straight to 1983 to avoid the stupidity of society today.Sometimes you just want a simple, hilarious, entertaining little movie to watch at any time of the year and Vacation definitely fits the profile. Watching it is like living through your old family home videos and Super-8 recordings (or camcorder videos if you grew up in a later time, although I was born in the Nineties my family always used older home video equipment). It's hard not to love the misfit Griswold family and there have been some other movies of their adventures out there but Vacation is the best way to start.",National Lampoon's Vacation
57,punishmentpark,"""Hey, ho, let's go!""",9,3 April 2016,"This remains fun stuff, still, and I deem it the best installment of the 'Vacation' series. It's pretty straightforward American comedy stuff, but here and there, there are some sharp observations about American life (and life in general, I suppose) and some bits are pretty nasty or dark; let's put aunt Edna (dead) on the roof of the car or leave her hanging dead in a chair with a relative, forget to unhook the dog from the car and drive for a while, aunt Edna who doesn't mind eating a sandwich which was micturated (Imdb's 'auto-correct' seems to think this word does not exist...) upon by the dog, etc., etc..Chevy Chase is perhaps a love-or-hate actor, but I think he's excellent for this type of job. Beverly D'Angelo is also perfect for her role, and, out of the various duos that have played son Rusty and daughter what's-her-name Anthony Michael Hall and Dana Barron are probably the best (although Juliette Lewis was pretty damn good, too). And, of course, good old Randy Quaid as Cousin Eddie - irreplaceable. And there's plenty more little fun parts.A big 9 out of 10 for this ever funny classic.

Some films--Kissing a Fool,She's All That and Rat Race come to mind--really aren't very good at all. Then there's this one,which seems to be in the minority,and it is VERY worthy of being rerun over and over again.The Grisowlds,a WASPy middle America family from Chicago,are going on their yearly summer vacation. DAd Clark(Chevy Chase,in one of his best roles)decides to take the family via automobile,and he loads the famile into a Pea-green station wagon. Mom Ellen(Beverly D'Angelo)just wants peace in the family,and is supportive to the teeth. Kids Audrey and Rusty(Dana Kimmel and Anthony Michael Hall)are naturally turned off by their parents,but they go along because they want to get to WalleyWorld in Anaheim(remind you of anyplace?) bad enough.The ensuing trek westward is,of course,hardly smooth. Between overbearing family members(Randy Quaid as a loudly obnoxious Kansas cousin and Imogen Coco as a cranky and borderline-insane great aunt are particularly good),pesky animals, ignored roadblocks, car vandalizing and unplanned fatalities pepper the family's voyage toward the promised land. The naturalness of Chase(who is a much better physical comedian than verbal one) and the rest of the cast as family make the pratfalls and verbal gaffes all the more fitfully fun.This is the definitive Vacation movie:the European Vacation would be a passable but unspectacular offering,Christmas Vacation would be inspired but could almost be its own separate film. I have yet to sit through Vegas Vacation but what I saw of the film struck me as a shallow attempt to capitalize on the franchise at best.

60,mentalcritic,1980s B-grade comedy at its most... average,6,25 July 2005,"The Vacation series has taken on a kind of inverse version of the Star Trek series rule, in that the odd-numbered Vacations are the best. The original Vacation is the best, although Christmas Vacation gave it a good run for its money. Both films are incredibly dated, but it is the savage lack of restraint or political correctness in the original that makes it worth repeat viewings. 1983 was a great year for comedies that were unafraid of being labelled as being in bad taste, and director Harold Ramis had already proved his mettle on Caddyshack, one of the finest films ever made about golf. Paired with such fine actors as Chevy Chase and Randy Quaid, there was precious little that could go wrong here. When it does go wrong, the audience is too busy laughing at the other ninety nine instances where the cast and crew get it right to care. Unlike many other comedies where jokes are deleted because they didn't test well, Vacation simply leaves the failures behind and moves on to the next.The plot concerns itself with one Clark Griswold, a designer of food additives who wishes people would take him more seriously. He takes his family on a road trip across the USA, with the final destination being a theme park known as Wallyworld. Wallyworld being a cheap knock-off of Disneyland, naturally. None of the film is really rooted in reality, as the moment when the old Griswold family car is ceremoniously towed off to be crushed at the car dealership. Maybe it is meant to demonstrate how spineless a man Clark is, but even the most timid man would file complaints or sue if the vehicle he ordered turned out to not be there on the delivery date, and his old car was written off. Clark's spinelessness is a two-edged sword. It drives the comedy very effectively in some scenes, but it grates in others. As I have more or less indicated, it only works when there is no good reason for him to be more aggressive.The plot thread with Clark lusting after a babe in a Ferarri (that is more or less how she is billed) is incredibly dated nowadays. Christie Brinkley puts in a great performance as the piece of tail that this spineless wimp keeps chasing in spite of the fact that he should know this woman is so out of his league. Dana Barron and Anthony Michael Hall are great as the long-suffering Griswold children, who alternate between being amused at the misadventures on the road and reflecting on what a big wuss their father is. Observant viewers will noticed that Anthony Michael Hall grows a foot or two between the introductory sequences and the arrival at the Griswolds' destination. John Candy gets a great cameo as a security guard who seems as spineless as Clark. But it is Randy Quaid, Miriam Flynn, Jane Krakowski, John Navin, and Imogene Coca as Ellen's relatives who make the film as funny as people remember. One almost wishes there could be a film entirely devoted to these idiots.For sure, Vacation is incredibly dated, and some of the humour in it has been lost to time. It has also spawned more sequels than any franchise this ordinary deserves. Then again, you could not have Christmas Vacation without European Vacation, so I guess we should take the good with the bad. Anthony Michael Hall has defied expectations and had a decent career since, while Dana Barron and most of the rest of the cast have seemingly dropped off the face of the Earth. Chevy Chase has basically been reduced to the B-list, making the kind of films that rarely get released on video outside of America, if at all. Fortunately, director Harold Ramis has gone onto much bigger and better things, as an actor, director, and a writer. Unfortunately, this kind of B-level comedy that used to fill the rental shelves has been phased out in favour of politically correct drivel. I guess some you win, some you lose.I gave Vacation a six out of ten. Unlike some other comedies that have ""this is a product of the 1980s"" stamped all over them, it has not aged well. It is, in fact, quite a step down from Caddyshack, Chevy Chase's previous collaboration with Harold Ramis. Still, if you are bored and could do with some nostalgia, Vacation might be worth a try.",National Lampoon's Vacation

So he plans a big old family vacation, a cross-country drive from their home in Chicago to California. Ultimate destination: Wally World. That's Disneyland with a moose instead of a mouse. Unfortunately Clark's best-laid plans go horribly awry. You see, Clark is a bit of an idiot. And a rather spineless idiot at that, constantly taken advantage of. The tone is set right at the beginning when an unscrupulous car salesman foists a total lemon on Clark. And thus the Griswolds set out on the road in the Wagon Queen Family Truckster, the most ludicrous station wagon to ever hit the highway. Let the laughs begin. Except...where are the laughs?Vacation is a movie which has acquired a glowing reputation but truth be told it just isn't funny enough. There are no huge laughs. There really aren't even that many mild chuckles. Much of the humor falls flat and there are some lengthy lulls where there is absolutely nothing funny going on. Chevy Chase puts in a game effort as the bumbling Clark but he gets very little help. Beverly D'Angelo has nary a funny moment as Clark's wife. The two kids are nothing more than annoyances, unfunny annoyances at that. A stop at Cousin Eddie's house to meet up with the Griswold hillbilly relations provides a few decent jokes but some real groaners as well. This pit-stop also saddles the Griswolds and us with Aunt Edna, a character which doesn't work at all. Anything funny the movie tries to do with her pretty much fails completely. The Griswold family adventure continues, mishaps and misadventures all along the way. The movie tries for a madcap big finish. It needed a big finish after being rather mundane throughout. But much like everything else that finish is a bit of a dud too. It's a movie which has its moments.

The outrageous, and often completely tasteless, humour goes down better once it's digested properly. Chase's sickening obsession with everyone having to enjoy themselves is a wonder to behold, he will go to any lengths to complete this mess of a journey.The film goes completely overboard and that actually works in the film's favour. The ultimate fate of Aunt Edna is hilarious, but also one of the more shameless jokes I can remember. Randy Quaid, as cousin Eddie, is completely revolting (and judging by a comment made by his daughter, a beyond loathsome) character but he's very funny none the less, Quaid milking the character for all it's worth.The script is very witty at times, throwing in countless below the belt humour (animal cruelty anyone) but unfortunately some gags here miss completely and go on way too long. The ending is also a bit too silly for my taste.Still, the film has more things going for it than against it.

64,jhclues,"Meet The ""Griswolds!""",9,17 December 2000,"The one that introduced the Griswold Family to the world, `National Lampoon's Vacation,' directed by Harold Ramis, is a side-splitting comedy starring Chevy Chase as Clark W. Griswold, Jr., who is arguably the best, and most memorable, character he's ever created for the silver screen.  It's summer vacation time, and Clark has ordered a new sports model station wagon to drive the family from Chicago to Los Angeles; their destination:  The one and only `Walleyworld' amusement park in beautiful Southern Cal.  But things begin on a somewhat dubious note when the car Clark ordered hasn't arrived, and he has to settle for the `Family Truckster,' which the salesman (Eugene Levy) tells him is superior to the one he ordered and, moreover, is just the vehicle for driving the `whole tribe' across the country.  And it's only the beginning of a vacation the Griswolds (as well as the audience) will never forget. 	Working from a screenplay by John Hughes that is clever and filled with subtle humor, Ramis also uses the natural abilities of Chase and the rest of his cast to full advantage, punctuating the wittiness of the script with some broad strokes of physical comedy that blend well within the framework of the story.  The project was in good hands with Ramis, who knows the territory and keeps it all flowing with a good pace and excellent timing. He was especially successful with Chase, who in other films has had a tendency at times to wander a bit from the humorous aspects of his characters; but not here.  His `Clark' is right on the money.  Beverly D'Angelo (Ellen Griswold) does a good job as well, in a role that is basically one of playing `straight man' for Chase and his shenanigans.  And they have an on-screen rapport that helps make even their screwiest antics believable. 	In the four `Vacation' movies, the only parts that had different actors each time were those of the `Griswold Kids,' the best of which were the original, with Anthony Michael Hall as Rusty and Dana Barron as Audrey (the second best were Johnny Galecki and Juliette Lewis in `Christmas Vacation'). They round out what is, somewhat surprisingly (for all of their comical situations and circumstances) a fully `functional' family anchored by Clark, who always starts out, at least, with only the best intentions.  Also outstanding, in the role he reprises in the third and fourth installments of the series as well, is Randy Quaid as the inimitable `Cousin Eddie,' a relative the likes of which can be found in just about any family anywhere; the cousin nobody wants to claim, whose heart is bigger than his brain. It's a characterization rooted deeply in Americana, and one you won't forget. 	The supporting cast includes Miriam Flynn (Cousin Catherine), Eddie Bracken (Roy Walley), Imogene Coca (Aunt Edna), Brian Doyle-Murray (Kamp Komfort Clerk), James Keach (Motorcycle Cop), Frank McRae (Grover) and John Candy (doing a hilarious turn as Lasky, a Guard at Walleyworld).  A movie for anyone who's ever taken a vacation with the whole family (or even for those who haven't), `National Lampoon's Vacation' is a laugh-filled, upbeat and highly entertaining movie that, between the laughter, will make you think about a few things (like verifying the schedules of an amusement park) the next time you start planning the family vacation.  This may not be the `perfect' comedy, but it comes awfully close; and if the number of laughs it gets are any indication, it at least puts it somewhere near the top.  If you haven't seen this one yet, don't waste any more time; this is one that's going to brighten your day.  I rate this one 9/10.",National Lampoon's Vacation

67,Hollywood_Yoda,The Original and One of the Best,9,6 November 2018,"When you think about the 1980s, it's hard to imagine without Chevy Chase as Clark Griswold. One of the best films to come out in 1983, National Lampoon's Vacation is a cross country, family road trip comedy. The director, Harold Ramis and the writer, John Hughes made for a great combination.Of course Chevy Chase stars alongside Beverly D'Angelo as Clark and Ellen Griswold as they trek from Chicago to California. Along the way, they visit Cousin Eddie (Randy Quaid's first appearance) and Aunt Edna (Imogene Cocoa). Some of the best lines and scenes in the movie involve Aunt Edna. She was a great character, similar to Aunt Bethany in Christmas Vacation.This is the installment that includes the the theme park Walley World with Marty Moose. Vacation features John Candy in an early role and his first collaboration with John Hughes. Also featured in an early role is Eugene Levy as the car salesman. A fun movie, but rated R (a soft R) for language and some partial nudity.",National Lampoon's Vacation
68,gab-14712,Funnier Than I Thought It Would Be!,8,11 October 2019,"The National Lampoon franchise was the face of comedy in the 1980's, no doubt about it. Honestly, I initially shied away from these films because I thought they looked pretty lame if I am to be blunt. Given the fact that I really enjoyed National Lampoon's Animal House and given the talent behind and in front of the camera, I knew I would have to give in at one point. Plus, there was a much-heralded remake of this film (which was maligned). I saw the movie, and well I can say I did not hate it. It was silly, but in a fun way. There are jokes that were actually hilarious. The script, which was written by 80's lovable stalwart John Hughes, was pretty decent. Harold Ramis, who previously directed an 80's favorite Caddyshack, was behind the camera for this feature and does quite well with the material that is given to him.This film introduces us to the Griswold family, headed by patriarch Clark (Chevy Chase). He, along with his wife Ellen (Beverly D'Angelo), son Rusty (Anthony Michael Hall), and daughter Audrey (Dana Barron) plan to travel to Wally World, an amusement park in Los Angeles. Clark has everything planned out to the wire, but if you think it will stay that away, think again. Many hijinks ensue on their way to family paradise; such as getting lost and given bad directions, a family meetup with Ellen's cousin and her rather sloppy husband, Eddie (Randy Quaid). Then there is the super annoying Aunt Edna (Imogene Coca). A whole bunch of issues occur on the road, and these issues are driving Clark insane! Who can forget about the woman in the red Ferrari (played by Christine Brinkley)? Will his family make it to Wally World in one piece?I do not think the movie would have even been adequate if it was not for the cast. These roles are natural for the unique talents that each actor/actress brought to the table. Chevy Chase made a career out of turning strait-laced characters into comedy gold. While this performance somewhat reminds me of his Caddyshack role, but it is a more relatable performance in a way, at least to me. How many times do I plan something down to the second and it turned out not to be that way? I feel your pain, Clark Griswold. In addition to the regular cast, this film is filled with awesome cameos. Eugene Levy as a shady car salesman? Awesome! Henry Gibson as a hotel clerk? Even more awesome! John Candy as one of the guards at Wally World? The most awesome cameo of all! The last 20 minutes of the film may be my favorite thanks to John Candy. He is a national treasure!There are many kind of jokes to watch out for. There are the usual in-your-face sort of jokes, but also more subtle ones that are hard to pick up. Not every joke worked for me, but enough did where I would want to continue on with the zany adventures of the Griswold family. I heard Christmas Vacation and European Vacation are must-sees so perhaps I will give them a look. There are lines that you'll remember for a long time, and it was a shock for me to discover John Hughes was the writer behind this R-rated, crude comedy. As a road trip film, I had a really fun time. I do not consider this to be a comedy ""classic"", but it's good enough for me.My Grade: B",National Lampoon's Vacation

70,itamarscomix,Wickedly Funny,7,4 August 2012,"""Vacation"" was Harold Ramis' second movie as a director and John Hughes third as a writer, and it was a huge step forward for both of them (Ramis' debut ""Caddyshack"" achieved cult status thanks to memorable performances and standout scenes, but the movie as a whole was a complete mess). Vacation is a terrific comedy, one of the best to come out of the National Lampoon brand; Chevy Chase and Beverly D'Angelo deliver perfect comedic performances, making all the visual gags as well as the sharp script work very well, despite various jokes which have become clichés since and quite a few that were clichés to begin with. The timing and pacing are good enough to make even those work.My only real complaint about Vacation - and it greatly hindered my enjoyment - is about jarring moral dissonance in the main character. It became very clear to me in the dog scene that Clark isn't someone I can sympathize with. That scene may be the most revolting and least funny in the movie, as it's played horrifically straight; and Clark gets off extremely easily. In fact, throughout the movie, the more horrible he is, the more it seems Ramis and Hughes are trying to make him look sympathetic. It's especially evident when Clark's wife catches him - not flirting - but skinny dipping with a strange girl, and forgives him completely several minutes later; and in the tacked on ending, when he gets off completely scot-free from actions that should land him in jail and traumatize his children. Clark's family seemingly forgives everything, and it's apparent that we as viewers are meant to do the same. To be clear - the problem is not with an unsympathetic protagonist or black comedy by themselves, but with lack of decision from the writer and director, who zig-zag between violent black humor and wholesome family comedy.",National Lampoon's Vacation

Chevy Chase in the lead role of Clark Wilhelm Griswold, Jr. is spot-on hilarious with Beverly D'Angelo equally funny as Ellen Griswold. But really, it is Randy Quaid as Uncle Eddie and especially Imogene Coca as Aunt Edna who steal the show. Watch out for these funny supporting characters who pop up throughout the film as the Griswolds do a cross-country drive to try to get to the WallyWorld Theme Park (for some reason, every time I hear Walley World, I think Wonder World from Beverly Hills Cop III!).

Anyone who's been on a similar journey as Griswalds know that the journey itself is more adventurous than the vacation itself. And that some family members are best to see only once in a year.This movie is considered a classic and the most recognizable movie of Chevy Chase . I like it, but I have to say that this isn't my favourite Chevy Chase movie . I can agree that this is his best performance . His Clark Griswald is a mild mannered man who wants everything to be perfect . Unfortunately , he's an unlucky person and he often has to fights against the odds to achieve his dream . What Chase plays here might be too subtle for some people . I admire how he was able to show a man keeping a straight face even during the most crazy times. He's humble and not too charismatic , yet he does everything not to show it. He wants to be a perfect husband and father , despite that he lacks confidence and everything seems to be against him . He's a very likable person .Beverly D'Angelo gives a good support as the patient and loving wife . I also like Randy Quaid as the disgusting cousin Eddie. Both are kinda underrated comedy actors and that's a shame. Watch out for John Candy (""Planes , trains and automobiles"") as the amusement park guard.The jokes here are mostly simple , but they work. Some are lame and there is one rather disgusting and unfunny joke with the dog and leash . Thankfully , there are some subtle jokes here that you might miss during the first watch ( like Clark speaking nicely to the bartender after the shotgun accident).There are some nice songs here – the most famous title theme song Lindsey Buckhingham ""Holiday road"" , Pointer sisters ""I'm so excited"" and June Pointer ""Little boy sweet"".I give it 8/10.",National Lampoon's Vacation

You get National Lampoon's Vacation, a comic treat from Ramis and Hughes.Chase plays bumbling father Clark Griswold, who works with food additives. He decides to take his family on a road trip from their home town of Chicago to Wally World amusement park in California. Wally World is from a popular T.V. show about a talking animal. Three guesses on who that's a parody of, and the first two don't count. Clark's wife Ellen (D'Angelo) wants to fly out, and so do his kids, Rusty and Audrey (Hall and Dana Barron). Who does want to be in a car for 5600 miles (round trip)? Just so you know-they don't get there safe and sound.Chase is in top form as Clark. You can imagine no one else in that role. His comedy is funny, and a certain cockiness (as being the father figure) he brings to Clark is great, too. He's not the best actor in the world, but he still brings out laughs. Hughes's script is right on target; it's not mean-spirited or cruel. And the way the cast pulls it off is hilarious.D'Angelo is good as the typical wife. She brings common sense to Clark's wacky behavior. Hall and Barron are great as the kids who bicker with each other, and I really like Quaid as Clark's cousin Eddie.As I've said before, Hughes's script isn't fat jokes and gross-out body functions, it's the introduction of the American Family to out-of-the-ordinary situations. Sure, some of the plot is outlandish, even unbelievable. But when you watch the other three movies in this series, it looks like a walk in the park.I loved Coca as complaining Aunt Edna who comes along for the ride. Her sarcastic humor brings a new style of the movie. We have plain, kind jokes. We have jokes about swearing. And now we have jokes with sarcasm. She is really great.I love Ramis and the movies he directed (in exception to Caddyshack). I feel that some of his movies are underrated (Bedazzled, for instance). Vacation isn't underrated much, but I'm surprised it hasn't got a bigger following or higher reviews. But, you can tell it's him, and it's a great movie (which could only be done with Ramis and Hughes together) that needs to be watched again and again.My rating: 9/10Rated R for some language, nudity, and drug use.",National Lampoon's Vacation
79,LebowskiT1000,A classic,9,7 October 2003,"""Vacation"" isn't the funniest movie ever made, but it sure does have it's moments.  At first glance you may think that this is a family film, but this film most certainly is not. The film is aimed toward the adult audience (or those over 18) and is rated R for a reason.  You must also keep in mind while watching this film that it was made in the early 1980's and therefore will have a great deal of differences in humor than today's comedies, so it must be treated as one.There are some aspects of the film that are just all-around hilarious, then there are others that are rather morbid and dark, and even some moments that are very un- Politically Correct by today's standards.  But, all in all, it makes for an excellent film.The cast members are all quite good and all pull off fantastic performances. Chevy Chase leads the film and does so quite well, in one of his funniest roles to date.  He's reason enough to watch the film, Chevy is great.  Beverly D'Angelo, looks better than ever and pulls off a very nice performance, she fit the role perfectly. Anthony Michael Hall and Dana Barron play the two children in the film, both of which do very nicely (it's too bad neither of them returned for any of the sequels).  Christine Brinkley, Randy Quaid, Eugene Levy and John Candy all pull off excellent performances, despite having such little screen time.  Also, it's rather interesting to see a very young Jane Krakowski (of TV's ""Ally McBeal"") in the film, as Cousin Vicki.  I also feel inclined to mention cast members Frank McRae and John Diehl, neither actor is terribly well known, but I like them.Like I mentioned above, ""Vacation"" is a classic!  And should definitely be seen by anyone who appreciates a good comedy.  Some of the comedy is a bit dated or has been done countless times since, but nonetheless, it's good to know where it all started.  I would definitely recommend seeing this film to anyone that likes comedy films, or just likes Chevey Chase, director Harold Ramis, or any of the other cast-members.  I hope you enjoy the film as much as I do.  Thanks for reading.",National Lampoon's Vacation
80,policy134,Chevy Chase gives a real performance,9,30 June 2015,"This is almost a perfect comedy and I have watched this maybe 20 times. It's not only a very funny movie, but it is the most relatable film ever made. We have all been on these family trips where you are supposed to have fun but instead, everything goes to hell.What is so amazing about this film is Chevy Chase. He actually gives a performance whereas in many of his other movies he just seems bored. I loved Fletch when I was a kid, but you can tell that Chevy tries very little and he is not in his element in this type of action-comedy. Here, he is outstanding.There are so many great scenes in this show: 1) The dead aunt on the roof - 2) The visit to Ellen's cousins, especially the discussion about french kissing (what a horrible image it gives you). Of course, it went way over my head as a kid - 3) The scene in the desert, where Clark nearly croaks from dehydration and many, many more. There are a few rough spots as when the family drives into a black neighborhood. I understood what the filmmakers are trying to do, but it just falls flat. And the main sore point about the dead dog. I laughed at the time, but must admit that I felt a little guilty about it. The scene is played very well by both James Keach and Chevy.So, It is almost perfect but not quite. The ending actually made my stomach turn a little, because I am not a huge fan of rollercoasters. But John Candy is terrific and it is like no other movie performance he has made since then. It was a little far-fetched that Roy Walley does in the end, but what the hell, it's a movie, not real life.

If you notice in all the films mom and dad are always the same. That is the fun part but in all the films. The children are always different but that is for a reason. Why if you notice in the lines in the movie dad doesn't notice his own kids Lol WHY?
Because they are always using different kids and changing there ages. That is the funny part. That always made me laugh why?
Because you didn't know before the film even started I wonder how old his kids are now. Plus who is playing his kids now? Another great part is. Back in the day, the kids that played his parts are some of the biggest STARS TODAY.
That just shows how great these films are why. Because of the kids they use back then are not that big back then. This is just one of the FILMS that makes them look good.
Take a look at some of the kids on all his VACATION FILMS. It will kind of blow you away on what young stars that played his kids.
In just ONE VACATION FILM.
That was great that they changed his kids the way they did. But KEPT his wife the same I am a Film lover. In my opinion in VACATION FILMS, it was so SMART to change his kids around. Not only but the ages as well. Mom and Dad got Older Kids didn't really age that much. Example 1983 was his first film 1989 was Christmas Vacation.

'Vacation' can not really get a simpler story. A family travel to a particular place with unprepared comedic occurrences. The are some nice cameos featured, such as Eugene Levy and John Candy, an the film is a mixture of both physical and verbal comedy, with it nicely separated amongst the well played characters, with one of the best and remembered characters being Aunt Edna. But, the one character who gets the best portion of the jokes is Chevy Chase. He delivers all the lines so perfectly that creates one of the best characters of the film, and a character who is still being referenced to this day.I turned off the water, the stove, the heat and the air, locked the door, notified the police, stopped the papers.

Chevy Chase started his own franchise here as Clark Griswold, a businessman who wants to take his wife and kids on a two week vacation by driving out to Wally World Amusement Park in California. They encounter a bunch of mishaps on the way. And you'll be laughing at what the Griswold's go through during the course of the trip. Beverly D'Angelo plays Clark's wife Ellen, Anthony Michael Hall and Dana Barron are Clark's kids Rusty and Audrey, Imogene Coca is the cranky Aunt Edna, Randy Quaid is nutty Cousin Eddie, and the late John Candy is featured here in a bit part as a Wally World security guard. ""Vacation"" has very big laughs throughout with only one negative aspect in the film: the fate of Aunt Edna's mean dog. I didn't like the way this was treated. I love dogs and I don't like seeing dogs mistreated in movies. The good thing about this is that they don't show you what happens to the dog. They tell you through dialogue. But they couldn't show this in a comedy. Otherwise it would put a damper on the rest of the movie. This is only a minor complaint.

85,willcundallreview,A comedy with a great adventure,8,2 July 2014,"National Lampoon's Vacation is a comedy which boasts a fun family vacation with just crude laughter and some of the most random things ever. All jumbled together the film is fun to watch and with some great jokes physical and verbally, this is one comedy that I see never getting old. Done well by the late Harold Ramis, I felt the film was actually a firmly very good one, and here below is why I felt that way about it.The story is hectic but one of pure humour and a kind of comedy that is hard to really see done well in the present day, but the Griswold family make the film there own and bring laugh out loud jokes along with them. It goes at a nice pace and they seem to never over stay there welcome when they come across a new place, this allows for the diversity of the film to show and has a lot of different and new fast things all the time.Chevy Chase is just brilliant in the main role as the dad of the family, he just brings out everything a comedy actor in this type of role needs to be, if you ever think about making a family comedy, look no further than Chase for inspiration. Beverly D'Angelo and the two kids provide good support to kind of push Chase over the edge, the comedy is flowing out when they are in the car together. There are so many new people seen that they also have different effects on Chase and the family, it is just great to see his reactions.Directed by Harold Ramis, it is done well by him and his touch can be seen in every scene with just a little new direction here and a little there. The screenplay is also one of comedies greats, it has so many great lines in it and John Hughes is of course the man to provide such a thing. It is never done lazily by either also, and it seems that a lot of thought was put into even the most stupid of jokes, just good good fun.The only criticisms I would have of Vacation, it can be kind of crude and maybe at times over does it, not as a whole movie but certain parts anyway. I think it all depends on what type of humour you enjoy the most, the film does lack what it had at the beginning toward the end but still manages to get some massive laughs out of you first. One more thing, the acting is never great from anyone but what do you expect, it is a comedy and Chevy Chase is by far the main character but also the best actor here in the film.I think if you like 80's screwball comedies and the kind of funny film that moves along the USA with a fast pace of jokes, this is for you all over. If you also like a bit of rude or crude humour dabbled in, but not always, then this is also one to watch. I think some may not like it mostly from the fact the jokes can be silly, they are funny though and I guess the film would have to come down to personal preferences.Overall it is truly a Firmly Very Good movie, it has comedy elements we need to see more of these days but also the typical trademarks so many great 80's comedies provided. Sit back and relax, they say this is for the people who saw it in the 80's but I disagree, it is for everyone and even modern audiences alike would enjoy this, thoroughly funny, great jokes all around and just some stupid-ness from all the cast in between, go watch it now if you want to be entertained.",National Lampoon's Vacation

Walley World is the best idea ever for a movie I still can't believe how well John Candy played that part.John Candy is hilarious he is a definite funny fat man he stole the show in this movie, he did really.

89,mdm-11,"This ""vacation"" is headed for a lengthy hospital (or jail) stay",8,29 May 2005,"This is the first and very best of Chevy Chase's ""hellish"" Family Vacations. He takes his wife and 2 teenage kids on a road trip from Chicago to LA, with everyone's dream-theme-park ""Walley's World"" as the final destination. Unforeseen (and eventually predictable) problems lurk around every corner. From being cheated by a car salesman to being ""taken"" by various locals, to ""visiting"" with bumpkin relatives, this trip includes every imaginable disaster. There are many subtle jokes that seem to elude the cast members delivering them. When the wife clears the left-overs from the dinner dishes, the husband wipes them off (without washing them) and puts them in the cupboard. Neither of them seem to notice this, busy talking about their imminent trip. When Chevy Chase has a ""father to son talk"" with a young Anthony Michael Hall, he puts on his eyeglasses (presumably for dramatic effect), but almost immediately one half of the frame falls off, the other half following quickly. Both father & son ignore the incident and just continue talking. Imogine Coca basically plays ""herself"" as the obnoxious Aunt Edna,who meets with an untimely death while ""hitching a lift"" to yet another relative. Her funniest moment is when she (upon giving it some thought) eventually decides to have a big bite of a sandwich suspected to have been drenched in dog urine.The ""f"" word flies freely, which would appear gratuitous today, but by 1983 standards was considered ""standard"". The ""R"" rating seems a bit harsh, though. Even with brief ""glimpses"" at female breasts and several sexual innuendos, today a PG-13 rating would have been the most. Hints at marijuana use are so subtle that anyone unfamiliar with the practice would ""miss it"". Fears of corrupting minors are unfounded.This is a very entertaining trip through the USA with a roller-coaster ride at Walley's World as a reward. This vacation inspired 3 sequels!

90,nickmesafilms,National Lampoon's Vacation (1983) - The Griswolds are Heading for Wally World!,10,6 February 2012,"""National Lampoon's Vacation"" has been wildly considered as one of the most classic comedies of the 1980s. Harold Ramis directs this hilarious tale starring Chevy Chase and Beverly D'Angelo as Clark and Ellen Griswold, who plan a 2-week cross-country road trip to California with their kids. From then on, tons of unexpected situations and shenanigans occur. This is one of my favorite comedy movies for many reasons. This movie kept me laughing my buttocks off, from start to finish. This movie just brings out laugh after laugh, and I can't stop laughing. Chevy Chase delivers the most hilarious performance of his career playing the father who is determined to give his family the best vacation ever. He has is best moments and always makes me laugh, so if Chevy Chase is not in this 80s classic, then you don't have Chevy Chase in this 80s classic. This all-star cast includes Anthony Michael Hall, Randy Quaid, Dana Barron, Imogene Coca, John Candy, and Christie Brinkley. They all made performances that really made this low-budget comedy. This movie has the funniest lines, funniest characters, funniest plot, and funniest situations. There are also some familiar moments from the crappy car, the girl in the Ferrari, the car crash in the Grand Canyon, and the annoying Aunt Edna. I can watch this movie over and over again, and I still laugh every time. To keep this review short, if you don't laugh at this classic movie, then you are a total failure at life.

92,mmallon4,Getting Away From It All,10,11 August 2016,"The noble all American pursuit of taking your family on vacation (or holiday as we call it in the UK); that is the ultimate aim of Clark Griswold. Chevy Chase is Clark Griswold in one of those roles which is so identified with one actor. He's such a family man in an extreme yet subtly comic way with is repressed frustration making him a ticking time bomb. He's a proponent of the American dream if there ever was one; an unashamedly white Anglo Saxon protestant who takes family ideals a little too far at times.Vacation is my favourite John Hughes movie and a very American movie at that. You can't do this in the UK; here you can hop in your car and you will be at the other end of the country in a day. It seems like the idea of a road trip was designed for the vast open country of the United States in which you drive for days on end. However, the theme of vacation (or holiday) frustration is relatable to anyone who has been on vacation. As Clark puts it ""When I was a boy just about every summer we would take a vacation, and you know in 18 years, we never had fun"". Even the most out there jokes such as the car still moving while Clark has fallen asleep at the wheel or the death of the aunt still manage to feel relatable to some degree and remain grounded in reality.Road movies give some of the best opportunity to create great amounts of character development and I feel there are few other writers in cinema history who had the ability to generate so much character development within such a short space of time than John Hughes; and like The Blues Mobile of The Blues Brothers, the car in Vacation is a character itself. As seen in many of Hughes' film, the kids and/or young people are fully sexually aware (In Vacation Rusty's cousin teaches him about masturbation for the first time) which I find liberating to watch as Hughes is a writer who treats young people like adults with themes which were explored further in films like Sixteen Candles and The Breakfast Club. Sigh, why wasn't I a child of the 80's?Vacation is one of the most summery movies; watch it during the cold months of the year to escape the winter blues.",National Lampoon's Vacation

Let's talk about this ""American Vacation"". Well, I can say that they still had Harold Ramis to direct this one, since it could really turn out a crappable movie - an american family travels to the other side of the country to see a theme park? Talk about thick premise... But this is exploited to the best that they can take of it, and this journey really looks good, Chevy Chase being the real clownish hero which manages to save the day thanks to a really naive and stubborn dedication to causes no other person would embrace.

94,Brian-272,The best and funniest of the Lampoon Vacation series.,8,28 May 2001,"Over the years I have watched Vacation many times, it just happens to be one of those classic films of the 80's. Chevy Chase is as funny as can be as Clark Griswold a man who travels his family cross-country from home in Chicago, Illinois to vacation in California to visit Wally World theme park. Along the way just about anything you could imagine happens most are misfortune and mishap, but never worry Clark and the Griswold family finally make it the funny mishaps are the best parts of the movie! Some sex appeal can be found with Christie Brinkley and even Beverly D' Angelo has her moments as Mrs. Griswold. Good supporting performances from Anthony Michael Hall and John Candy also make this movie even more enjoyable. Vacation airs many times on basic cable it is still a popular movie after many years. Give this a watch if you haven't or you could be like me and watch and enjoy this 80's classic many times over and over.",National Lampoon's Vacation
95,mnpollio,An overrated mediocrity,5,9 August 2010,"There has been a trend in recent years to over-value a succession of 80s comedies and National Lampoon's Vacation is a prime example. Released in 1983, the film performed strongly at the box office despite crummy to mediocre critical response and spawned a slew of increasingly more desperate and inane sequels, which somehow made the original seem better than it truly was. Chevy Chase is the imbecile head of the Griswold family who embark on a disaster-prone cross-country trip to Wally World theme park. There should be a lot of comedy to mine from the scenario, but the film only hits on a handful of true guffaws before running out of steam altogether well before its climax. Chase alternates between looking bored and manic. His Clark Griswold is not only an idiot, but more than a bit of a nasty jerk which fails to elicit much in the way of audience sympathy. Beverly D'Angelo, Anthony Michael Halls and Dana Barrons round out the wife and kids. Most people probably will not remember Barrons in the film at all, while D'Angelo and Hall keep trying to act long after the writers have stopped giving them anything to do. Imogene Coca shows up for a brief highlight as a demonized aunt and manages to showcase one of the movie's great weaknesses. The legendary Coca was arguably one of the funniest old school comediennes at the time and the film hands her nothing to work with until unceremoniously bumping her off and turning her cadaver into a sight gag. Even worse and utterly laughless is a criminally unfunny joke about Chase dragging a family pet to death after tying it to the bumper of the car. Randy Quaid and John Candy are both odiously underused, while supermodel Christie Brinkley is excess baggage through no fault of her own as a hottie who keeps running into the Griswolds on their trip and provides Chase with temptation to stray. Her role culminates in a staidly filmed skinnydip at a hotel pool, which will fail to sate the hormones of the fanboys who have responded to the film's hit-or-miss lowbrow humor. Harold Ramis' direction can complimentarily be described as wildly uneven. A great Lindsay Buckingham opening song is the film's strongest asset. An army of increasingly inferior sequels manage to make this one look stellar by comparison.",National Lampoon's Vacation

100,antagonist117,"""National Lampoon's Vacation"" and forms of comedy",4,17 September 2014,"""National Lampoon's Vacation"" is a stupid comedy that has opportunities to be a smart one but opts out. The humor in it is, as humor is wont to be, highly dependent upon taste. People who like stupid comedies might guffaw at it, because to them, humor is best when it's big and bawdy and obvious and makes a lot of noise. In this philosophy of comedy, wackiness is directly proportional to hilarity. The equation is simple, and factors like believability, motivation, and meaning simply don't enter into it. People who like smart comedies might well take a different view of this movie and its trajectory. For them, it's still possible to chuckle, because watching dumb people do spectacularly dumb things has an id-level appeal: it is a common denominator, albeit a very basic one. But there is an irrepressible feeling that the movie ought to do a little more than the bare minimum. It is a movie, after all, not a collection of YouTube videos, and that means it has things like plot and characters. Stupid comedies don't rely on these things beyond their utilitarian functions as links between scenes. Smart comedies, on the other hand, use characters and plot to make something more complex than just a string of goofy vignettes on a theme. If humor is relative then one kind of comedy isn't objectively funnier than the other, but since the latter seems harder to achieve it tends to be more pleasing to the hard-to-please.""Vacation"" seems torn between an intermittent impulse to use its characters to create one of the many forms of smart comedy, namely satire, and a stronger impulse to confine its characters to the cartoon logic of stupid vignettes. I smiled at the sight of a station wagon full of people going airborne and crashing in the middle of the desert. I'd have smiled at that regardless of whether the family inside was perfect or dysfunctional or made up entirely of animorphic cats. But what I really laughed at came next, when Clark Griswold (dysfunctional human) sits down with his boy (dysfunctional human in training) and tries to give him a coming-of-age, man-to-man talk while his glasses fall apart on his face and he comes up blank on the name of his daughter. This scene is funnier, to me, than the car crash for three reasons. First, it requires characters like Clark who are well- defined enough to earn adjectives like ""myopic."" Second, it moves the human plot of Clark's descent into madness forward. Third and most impressively, it is a scene whose humor has a recognizable purpose: to satirize (dare I say lampoon?) a real-life target and make it appear foolish. The target is that old-fashioned father-knows-best mentality that was almost beyond question in the 1950s when director Harold Ramis and writer John Hughes were in the kid's position, but that was wide open to attack in the 1980s when they were Clark's age and knew how little they really knew. It is, for my money, the sharpest and funniest moment in the movie.But in ""Vacation"" such moments of satirical brilliance are the exception. Far more time is devoted to broad hijinks, at best, and to validation of Clark's alpha-male, mid-life-crisis fantasies at worst. The latter is a problem because it undermines the movie's satire and turns the dumb man-child trope into an enviable thing of pride, much the way Homer Simpson shades at times into unironic hero. What are we to make of the Christie Brinkley character, an 80s-type supermodel in a sports car who flirts with Clark despite the fact that he's a thoroughly square middle-aged man with a terrible car and a screaming family? Her motivations are unexamined, but Clark's consequence-free flirtation is depicted in great detail. It's now a movie for people who want to be him, not for people who want to see him taken down a peg. But Clark is not and need not be the movie's only figure of mockery. A gaggle of redneck cousins (including a young Jane Krakowski with one of the movie's most memorable lines) gets it pretty good, too—though this violates the principle that satire ought to punch up to real and self-styled authorities rather than down to the impoverished and unprotected.""Vacation"" is capable of more thoughtful applications of its comedy, and proves it on occasion, but it generally prefers to be broad, easy, and stupid.",National Lampoon's Vacation

102,CabbageCustard,An iconic comedy - I'm just not sure why.,4,27 March 2019,"I love clever comedy. I also can enjoy slapstick and silliness when it is done well. That being said, the appeal of Chevy Chase has been an abiding mystery to me. As a 'comedian', he has always struck me as totally unfunny. He is completely lacking in subtlety, wit, and anything remotely approaching funniness. All of those failings are on display in this movie. That's not to say this is a bad movie. I am well aware that many people have very warm feelings about this film and even consider it iconic. And there are some genuinely clever ideas here - and some dopey ones too. I just don't think they are carried off as well as they might be and I am left wondering how great this movie might have been with a genuinely talented star and better execution. There is genuine talent in the supporting cast. The problem is that not many of them are given a chance to really shine. It's nice to see Imogene Coca and John Candy and Eddie Bracken is always a pleasure. A pleasant surprise for me, too, was young Anthony Michael Hall who is in most scenes even though he doesn't always have a lot to do. He shows genuine comic talent, a good sense of timing and commendable restraint in his performance. It's a pity he didn't go on to reprise the role of Rusty in future installments in this franchise. One character who does turn up in future installments and who I would be happy to see dumped is Randy Quaid as the annoying Cousin Eddie. Like his co-star Chevy, he's just not funny.In summation, if you can stomach 90 or so minutes of Chevy Chase's over acting and don't have high expectations, National Lampoon's Vacation is an amiable enough way to spend the time. You can relax, turn your brain off and enjoy a pleasant distraction that won't challenge you or cause you to injure yourself from excessive laughing.",National Lampoon's Vacation

His wife Ellen(Hollywood's most underrated actress Beverly D'Angelo) wants to fly to California and his children Russ(Anthony Michael Hall) and Audrey(Dana Barron) would rather spend their vacation in Hawaii.

Yes, Clark drops several F-bombs at once when he loses it, shortly after Edna's ""eulogy."" But other than that, I think it would be OK for teens to see.

Altogether, I did enjoy it, partially thanks to the fact that I was able to put myself in the Griswolds' shoes and feel their relenting turmoil when they'd get into one disaster after another.  The comedy, however, could've been a lot sharper.  Most of the jokes are predictable.  Come on, when Clark bit into that sandwich, was it really a surprise when you found out the dog peed on it?  John Hughes, who wrote the script, obviously wasn't aiming for great punchlines.  I got a lot more chuckles than full-fledged laughs, but it's still a funny, likable comedy.  But I really could've done without that lamer-than-lame score.  I like the theme song, ""Holiday Road,"" but the rest of the music is almost vomit-inducing.  My score:  7 (out of 10)",National Lampoon's Vacation

Americans are capable of comedy, although are yet to master the British and their achievements in this genre. Each time I watch this film the delivery in Chevy's lines becomes funnier. The absolute classic for the movie is when Clarke talks about the Mississippi River and then the St Louis Arch.The cross country adventures are taken to extremes with great characters such as cousin Eddy at times stealing big Chevy's thunder. Don't be fooled, I'm not suggesting anyone deserved an Oscar. However, when you watch a comedy and it is comical then they have to be doing something right.

118,darkjosh,Classic Chevy and Anti-Road Trip Flick,7,22 October 2000,"Easily one of Chevy Chase's funniest films, Vacation skewers the great family road trip and generates quite a few moments of hilarity from the entire cast.When Chevy and his family decide to take a trip to Wally World (a hybrid of Six Flags and Disneyland), Chevy opts to take a good old-fashioned family road-trip in a station wagon (what else).  Predictably, things go bad from the beginning as they encounter the relatives (played hilariously by Randy Quaid) and their battle-axe Aunt (the equally funny Imogene Coca).While being predictable, it's a very fun flick to watch.  Chevy Chase is in top-form here as Clark Griswold, turning in a seethingly funny performance. It's a joy to see Chevy hide his contempt and disgust when Quaid gives him a great gift (""I saw how you liked mine"").  And their arrival at Wally World will no doubt have you in hysterics as well.Lightweight and fun, Vacation will leave a smile on your face and no desire to take a road trip any time soon.7 out of 10",National Lampoon's Vacation
119,blurnieghey,It Has Aged Well!,10,2 March 2021,"Comedy generally doesn't age well, often because it relies on current events, fads, politics, social mores, etc., that cease to be relevant or funny to future generations or even people a few years after it is released. Well, National Lampoon's Vacation doesn't suffer from that problem! I thought this movie was funny as hell as a kid and wondered what it would be like watching it as an adult and I was happy to discover that it is still hilarious and funnier than ever, as I was able to pick up on a few more jokes, seen through an adult's eyes. I'm not a Chevy Chase fan at all but he does a great job in this film, as do all the other actors. Just all-round funny, tasteless (but not overly so), non-stop laughs. Great stuff and I'm wondering if I should revisit the sequel now, although I seem to recall being somewhat underwhelmed by it. It was great seeing this movie again--like hooking up with an old friend.",National Lampoon's Vacation
120,Ben-Hibburd,National Lampoon's Vacation Review.,6,14 September 2017,"National Lampoon's Vacation is directed by Harold Ramis. It sees the Griswold family go on a family vacation to a water-park in California via a cross country road trip. Vacation is a fairly benign road movie. Whilst it doesn't offer anything fresh or original, what the film manages to do instead is maintain a good consistent level of humour throughout. Most of the comedy comes from Chevy Chase as the slightly naive father Clark, who gets all the best moments and punchlines.The best part of the film is the chemistry between the family. They all feel like they're genuinely part of a family. This is especially the case with Beverly D'Angelo who plays the mother Ellen, she brings a good amount of warmth and levity to the film as chaos is encompassing the family.The first half of the film is definitely the strongest part. As the film got further into it's run-time, it began to lose my attention. The film starts to drift midway through and becomes overly nonsensical. As the film entered into its final act, the slapstick humour became intolerable for me as it felt tonally inconsistent with the first half, which was somewhat over the top but still grounded in reality. In the end Vacation is a harmless comedy that has genuine moments of good humour, but gets bogged down in it's final act and becomes dull and slightly forgettable.",National Lampoon's Vacation
121,stebird,A fun packed family trip,10,27 July 2017,"A little camp and very dated granted, but National Lampoons Vacation is still a proper cheer me up and let go of life family film. Clark Griswold personifies the every man American, we've all got a little Clark Griswold in us regardless of how much you try and deny it. This guy is a family man through and through, a guy that only wants the best for his wife and two kids, but one day it suddenly hits him, that his kids are growing up and getting older, and he feels he's missed out on a large proportion of their childhood putting in the hours at work.Never fear, good old Clark has a trick up his sleeves, he's hired a station wagon and plans to take the whole family on a road trip across America, their final destination, Wally World of course!Now, as you can expect, the trip of a lifetime doesn't go all to plan and there's enough hiccups along the way to keep you laughing throughout the duration of the film.One such hiccup is the diversion they take to visit Cousin Eddie and his family, the kids, all of whom have a screw loose, and the ditsy wife who has very little in the way of brain power; but that's just the start, they pick up a piece of luggage in the way of Aunt Edna, and the legendary Imogene Coca provides some comedy gold.Not withstanding, yes the family (minus one casualty) do make it to Wally World in the end, tired, beat up and an absolute mess that is, but the film is based around the journey, not the destination. Chevy Chase, during the early eighties around the time the film was released, was one of the most sought after comedy players in Hollywood, he demonstrates why perfectly with his performance in Vacation. I felt that the film revolved around Clark (Chevy Chase), and the rest of the cast was there to back him up and have something for him to interact with. One example was the famous girl in the red Ferrari scene, with just tacky music playing in the background, and no dialogue exchanged in the scene at all, this scene perfectly demonstrates Chevy's comedy prowess, his facial expressions say it all, an attractive young lady in an attractive car lures him on and Clark (as expected) bites, speeding up the car to keep up with the girl until Ellen, his wife, stops him. Very eighties, very-very eighties, a film like this couldn't have been made this successfully in any other era, as demonstrated by the recent rehash of Vacation, starring Ed Helms; that new film changed it's style to fit with the modern era, whilst staying true to the original Vacation, yet in my humble opinion, the new film had absolutely nothing on the original, dated yet timeless, a film that no matter how much you've watched, it's still good to watch again and again. Top marks I really couldn't mark it any lower I'm afraid.",National Lampoon's Vacation
122,Blackace,One of the funniest trips you'll ever take.,8,13 December 2002,"If you don't laugh hard at some of the scenes in this movie, then you just don't have any sense of humor. Yes..this maybe corny silly humor, but it's laugh-out-loud funny. Mind you, I have literally seen this movie about 15 times (no joke) and I STILL laugh at the same funny scenes. There are just some classic lines in this film and Chevy Chase was at his best here. European Vacation and Vegas Vacation didn't live up to this classic. Only Christmas Vacation was close to this film it terms of script and funny scenes.Now we all know the story of this film by now. Clark Griswold wants to take his family from Chicago to California to visit the theme park Wally-World for vacation. The fun begins with Clark trying to get a new car and the laughs continue all the way to their destination.*****SPOILERS****** I don't want to give to much away, but some of the funniest lines are the following. 1) Eddie cooking burgers on the grill with no meat. He says, ""I don't know why they call this Hamburger Helpers, it stands great all by itself. 2) Clark about to use what he thinks is ketchup for his burger. He says, ""Oooooohhhhwww...real tomato ketchup Eddie?"" Eddie says, ""Only the best cousin."" All it is a bunch of crushed tomatoes. 3) Cousin Vicky stirring the kool-ade with her hands. Clark says, ""Can I help with that Vicky?"" 4) Some of the cruder lines include a talk between Cousin Vicky and Audrey. Vicky says, ""I know how to French Kiss"" Audrey says, ""Yeah so, every is doing that."" Vicky says, ""Yeah, but my Daddy says I do it the best."" Now the word ""Daddy"" was replaced with science teacher, girlfriend, dentist and other things for T.V. viewing, which didn't make it any better. 5) Ellen saying, ""The dog p***ed on the picnic basket and watching the reaction of Clark and Aunt Edna.This stuff is classic humor. If you don't laugh at one of these scenes, then this movie isn't for you. *******************END SPOILERS***************Vacation is one of Chevy Chase's best movies. I can't think of anyone I know who hasn't seen this movie at least once. If you haven't then rent it, TODAY. Also pick up a copy of ""Planes, Trains & Automobiles"" w/Steve Martin and John Candy.

125,kira02bit,Overrated,4,28 July 2015,"I remember seeing this film in the theaters as a teenager and finding it a mildly diverting, if not hilarious, road movie comedy. Despite being a box office hit on its release, the reviews were largely mediocre and, reading them in retrospect, fairly on target. With the Ed Helms reboot coming out, I decided to catch it again as an adult, and I must say that the rose-colored glasses of nostalgic sentiment coupled with the gaggle of increasingly dreadful sequels, give the original Vacation a reputation of hilarity that it simply does not live up to. In fact, it has aged badly.The simple story centers on the Griswold family (dad Chevy Chase, mom Beverly D'Angelo and siblings Anthony Michael Hall and Dana Barron) and their disaster plagued cross country road trip to Wally World. Pretty much everyone can relate to family trips, especially from childhood, that went horribly awry, which should give Vacation fertile ground to mine. Unfortunately, it too often misses the mark and ultimately wears out its welcome long before we reach the final destination.On the plus side, the film has a fun postcards opening credits sequence paired with Lindsay Buckingham's rousing Holiday Road. Then it starts to deteriorate. A huge problem rests with the central character of Clark Griswold and the performance by Chase. Anyone is sympathetic with well-intentioned travel plans that blow up due to circumstances beyond one's control (i.e., bad accommodations, car trouble, nasty relatives, unplanned side trips, weather, etc.) and can laugh about them after the fact. Much of this should be the focus of the comedy, but very little of these are exploited in this film. Instead, the film takes the low road and too many of the ""comical"" moments stem from Clark being a complete imbecile. He makes choices and has reactions that few, if any, sane human beings would. To make matters worse, he is also a rather mean-spirited jerk. We can laugh and be sympathetic with a likable well-meaning guy of average intelligence running into vacation road blocks beyond his control, but it becomes less funny when the guy is actually a fairly unlikable jerk whose foolishness is often the starting point of the problems.Also, a number of the jokes are simply not that funny and the side trips and subplots often seem little more than padding. The film also has its fair share of mean-spiritedness, which sours any good humor. Christie Brinkley makes several appearances as a hottie in a sportscar who keeps ostentatiously flirting with Chase on the road. Overlooking the fact that one cannot fathom why someone who looks like Brinkley would be wasting her time relentlessly trying to seduce a shlub like Clark with his wife sitting in full view in the passenger seat, what kind of jerk would unabashedly leer back with his rather lovely significant other present. This all culminates in a hotel swimming pool sequence that goes no where, other than to allow son Hall to give Chase a reverse father doesn't know best pep talk that rings hollow.A side trip to visit redneck relatives, led by a criminally unfunny Randy Quaid, is fairly laughless and seems present only to pad time and saddle the Griswolds with a hated aunt (Imogene Coca) and her dog. This could have been funny, but the film is so mean-spirited that instead of some great verbal banter between comedy legend Coca and Chase (and company), we instead end up with Chase murdering her dog by tying it to the bumper and dragging it to death and then precipitating Coca's fatal heart attack and then leaving her cadaver on her son's front stoop with a note. Oh the hilarity! This might be understandable if the aunt were a character of great villainy, but other than being mildly unpleasant, she does nothing to generate this level of malevolence towards her. If there is anyone in the audience that can relate to vacation memories like this, then I suggest you move quickly away from them and make for the exits.Chase's performance clumsily lurches between abject stupidity and meanness. D'Angelo, stuck in the stereotypical long-suffering wife straight man role (are there any other kinds in these comedies), acquits herself well despite having so few notes to play. Hall keeps trying to find something to do with his role long after the writers have given up. He has it made compared to Barron, who only gets a few reaction shots and nothing funny. Apparently, women need to play it straight and only guys can be funny. Coca seems game, but she is only on hand for a nasty gag at her expense.By the time the Griswolds do get to Wally World, the viewer is exhausted and not from laughing. The film has long since run out of gas. It has seemed like an endless trip and shortly after departure has ceased to resemble anything like a funny disastrous road trip that friends or family would regale you with. Truly, at least 20 minutes or so could be cut from the film to its benefit. This mediocre film was followed by the even worse European Vacation and Vegas Vacation, and a barely tolerable step up from those with Christmas Vacation.",National Lampoon's Vacation
126,cadfile,Thanks for the Vacation memories Griswolds,10,30 January 2005,"National Lampoon's Vacation is the first of a series of Vacation movies starring Chevy Chase, as Clark W. Griswold, and Beverly D'Angelo, as Clark's wife Ellen. It is also the best of the series.Clark decides to take his family on a cross-country drive to Wally World in California for their vacation. Although Ellen doesn't think much of the idea, she would rather fly, she dutifully goes along with it. It seems Clark is the only one who wants to do the trip. His children Rusty, played Anthony Michael Hall, and Audrey, played by Dana Barron, would rather go to Hawaii.The family sets out on their adventure in the what has to be the ugliest station wagon in history, the Wagon Queen Family Truckster. Mayhem ensues.This film is one of my all time favorites and has been since I saw it in 1983. The reason I like it is the humor of course. Not only from the physical comedy - like Clark walking through the desert - but also the lines in the movies that one is thinking but don't expect to hear. Sure some of the humor scrapes the gutter but overall the screenwriter and director squeezed every bit of comedy out of this movie.I also like the film because many of the episodes have some truth for those of us who have made the obligatory cross-country car trip with the family. The stories fit in with my experiences and those of my mother when she went on trips with her family back in the 1950's.We have all visited relatives who live in the sticks. We have all had car trouble and paid through the nose simply because we are from out of town and we have all stayed at less than clean camp grounds where the items in the brochure didn't match up with what was actually available. We have all taken a wrong turn and ended up on the bad side of a large city.That is what makes this film a classic. People can identify with many of the troubles and adventures the Griswold's experience and we can laugh at them. Even if a not so great thing happens, years later we sit around and laugh about it.The only other film in the series to capture the same magic as this one was ""Christmas Vacation"".This film also started the John Hughes era. He wrote the script and went on to direct, write, and produce some other classic films like ""The Breakfast Club"", ""16 Candles"", and ""Home Alone"".10/10",National Lampoon's Vacation
127,KingBrian1,Funny But No Too Funny,7,11 September 2014,Light hearted film of the 80 vintage. It does a great service to exploring the America of the late 20th century. Despite the movie it being a farce as described on the DVD there are revealing aspects of American lifestyle hidden within the movie. The scene whereby they travel down St Louis is one that is of contemporary interest.The movie is about a dysfunctional family traveling to LA from Chicago and the maladies and fatalities that befall them. The journey is a nightmare for the family and primarily a satire. The film is entraining without being a masterpiece. I found in some parts of the movie it was uncomfortable to watch than humorous. Such scenes involving the hicks were completely stereotypical that the presence of them on the show was in my opinion cheap humour and distasteful. In any case the movie did have some funny moments and the tone of the film was just right. The aurora of silliness was around this movie and made it a good quick fun movie to have on.,National Lampoon's Vacation
128,pleiades10,Excellent 80's comedy. Chevy Chase's finest.,8,24 October 2000,"""National Lampoon's Vacation"" chronicles a disaster ridden trek across country for the Griswold family. The origin is a suburb of Chicago, the destination is Wally World, an obvious spoof of DisneyLand, complete with it's own mascot and sing-song theme... ""M-A-R-T-Y... M-O-O-S-E.... What's that spell? Marty Moose!"" Every thing that can go wrong during the trip does. From the early botched effort to plan the trip on the home computer, to the unfortunate detour through St.Louis's seedy side... ""WHO DO I LOOK LIKE???? CHRISTOPHER COLUMBO????"", to the pit stop at a redneck cousin's house (the excellent Randy Quaid, lamenting the fact that he can't get too close to the microwave because of the metal plate in his head), to the ramping of the family truckster off a closed road into the middle of the desert. And once they finally arrive at Wally World... LOOK OUT!!!I've seen Vacation probably at least 20 times. And each time I laugh and laugh (although the demise of Aunt Edna's dog still seems unsettlingly harsh). The subplot of Christie Brinkley's sports car driving vixen, taunting Chase with occasional chance encounters, and an eventual skinny dip in a hotel's pool has become the stuff of comedy legend. Even so far as to be revisited briefly in the most recent Vacation sequel, Vegas Vacation.Everybody in this cast plays off each other quite well. Imogene Coca as the irritable Aunt Edna, and John Candy as the Wally World security guard were perfectly cast. The gentleman that plays Roy Wally is quite funny as well, spoofing Walt Disney to a ""T"". Make this a must see on your next family movie night!",National Lampoon's Vacation
129,thehappychuckler,One of the Better National Lampoon Movies,8,28 February 2019,"Back in 1983 one of the better National Lampoon movies was released in VACATION. Late-great writer/director Harold Ramis takes the director's chair and shows us quite quickly he was quite good with comedy. John Hughes takes writing credits and the script was based on a story he wrote in National Lampoon magazine. Interesting to note here on this site it states that both Ramis and Chevy Chase did rewrites on the script.The Griswolds lead by dorky father Clark (Chevy Chase) are off on a family vacation. Where are they going to go? Why Walley World of course! No, not Wal-Mart, but an actual place called Walley World with its own mascot in Marty Moose. With his wife Ellen (Beverly D'Angelo) and their two kids Rusty (Anthony Michael Hall) and Audrey (Dana Barron) they pretty much drive through living hell together to reach their destination. The antics also do not stop when they reach it.Having seen all the VACATION movies I would say the best is still the original (has garned three sequels and a reboot in 2015). This also was one of the better characters that Chevy Chase played and he makes me laugh in this one quite often. The other two I thought were Ty Webb from CADDYSHACK (also directed by Ramis) and Fletch from...well...FLETCH. I must say I think Chase did quite well when working with Ramis. It's not all Chevy Chase, though as the whole cast is funny and well written. For anyone though who has not seen the film this is NOT a family film. Contains strong language, nudity, drug use and underage drinking. Might be better for mom and dad to laugh at away from the kids.Also had two excellent songs by Lindsay Buckingham who was the guitarist from Fleetwood Mac. The tunes are 'Holiday Road' which is played many times during the film, is catchy and instantly makes me think of the hijinks that poor Clark is going through and 'Dancin' Across the USA' which is played over the end credits.Also starring Randy Quaid as Cousin Eddie (hilarious role that he plays again in sequels) and Christie Brinkley as the dream girl that Clark rather foolishly tries to go after while on the road. Two other actors I love and think are darn funny in this film are Eugene Levy as the slime ball car saleman Clark buys the new car off to take on the road and John Candy as one of the dimwitted security guards at Walley World.",National Lampoon's Vacation
130,MichaelMovieLoft,Poking fun at the all-American vacation,7,10 April 2003,"This is a classic. Clark Griswold wants to take the trip across country to Walley World. The only thing is Clark knows what to do to mess it up whether it be drivinginto the inner city or forgetting he tied the dog to the rear bumper of the car. In other words, this is the nightmare vacation. The type that even your family would give up on. But not our Clark as it turns intoan obsession (""I'm on a pilgrimage to see a moose!!!""). The acting is great all around. Chevy Chase is in the finest form of his career as neer-do-well Clark. We suffer along with him as he deals with in-laws, flirts with 'the girl in the Ferrari', and getting ripped off by corrupt mechanics. The film barely punctures the R-rating only for the fact it is full of strong language. It could've been probably made as a 'PG' film since much of it is directed toward the family and is mostly harmless. My main problem is many local TV and cable stations still use the stale 1986 CBS edit that adds in different dialogue (I'm sure everyone knows the 'Christopher Columbo' line by heart), and cuts out scenes that would be considered harmless today. If you going to watch it on TV, catch on TNT as they have their own edit that includes many scenes that were cut out the first time. With that in mind, get ready to pack up the family truckster and prepare for one vacation you will never forget!!!",National Lampoon's Vacation

Harold Ramis also has a small part, and he delivers some funny moments as a used car salesman. I have had enough bad experiences to appreciate some of the moments from this movie.

But since he is so incredibly dumb, the trip ends in disaster and the poor family runs into trouble everywhere they go. Will they reach Wally World in one piece?Chevy Chase is brilliant in the role of his life. It´s a pleasure to see him screw up his family´s vacation, but also trying to remain proud and happy. The other family members do good jobs as well, and so does Randy Quaid (hilarious!) as Chase´s brother-in-law. John Candy also turns up towards the end, as a fumbling security guard.Most jokes are funny, some are just silly.

I remember bits and pieces (of the early ones) from throughout my youth, but have never sat down to really watch all four movies. First up was the original family Vacation to Wally World. I was blown away by how funny this movie really is. Chevy Chase is at his comedic best. Chase perfectly portrays the average smuck, who tries so hard to be the best dad in the world, but his complete failure in every attempt makes his character, nevertheless, all the more lovable. The two kids (Dana Barron, Anthony Hall) portray the Griswald children the best of all the sets of children. Rusty is hysterical as the beer-guzzling advisor of his mis-guided father.The kind of movie where you know everything is going to go wrong, but you laugh anyway when it does. Full of hilarious characters (e.g. Cousin Eddie, Aunt Edna), genuinely funny situations, and wild kinetic energy, this movie is full of fun and great laughs. The timing, the directing, the performances are all excellent.  FINAL RATING: 9/10 A movie you can watch over and over again. A comedic masterpiece. Enthusiastically recommended to any fan of movies!

137,Illini_Wrestling_Fan,Twisted Serial Killer's Journey Through the Heartland,10,24 September 2020,"His first kill was the easiest to hide. A simpleton car salesman Ed (played by Emmy-winner Eugene Levy) is easily manipulated by Chevy Chase's demented Clark Griswold. Crushing the victim's body in the rear compartment of Griswold's old truckster, Ed unwittingly conceals the first in a line of corpses stretching from the placid Chicago suburbs to the palm-tree-lined streets of Orange County.The ill-fated Griswold clan has no idea that their beloved food-additive-designer father has a murder spree in mind that will end in their brutal demise. After tempting the kids with suicide by forcing them to listen to a hellish medley, Griswold takes the family to the edge of disaster while faking sleep to see if they notice his slaughter of their innocent mother (Beverly D'Angelo).After his reckless driving fails to elicit the desired response, Griswold murders his naked wife in a hotel shower with an unripe banana. After hiding her corpse under a filthy hotel blanket, Chase keeps the kids in the dark, a feat made easier by their sheltered upbringing wherein all Black people know the Commodores.Hoping to hide the body of his wife in the worm farm of crazy cousin Eddie (Randy Quaid), Griswold encounters other future victims in the form of doomed Aunt Edna and her mangy mutt. In a telltale sign of Griswold's brutal nature, he intentionally kills the dog by tying it to the truckster bumper. When this canine calamity failed to quench his platelet-powered-palate, Griswold executes Edna while the kids sleep in the back seat, traumatizing young Audrey in an attempt to groom a blood-drenched successor.Arriving in California, Clark stops at the gun shop, hoping to escalate his rampage by creating an amusement park killing field. However, California's stringent gun laws prevent the mentally ill patriarch from obtaining the desired weaponry.Demonstrating that all it took in 1983 to gain free admission to the country's most prestigious theme park was a bogus 9mm, Griswold and his remaining (underage) family die in a hail of SWAT bullets in Roy Walley's Islamaphobic funhouse. The dying Griswolds envision an alternate reality where they travel the ""Holiday Road"" in the friendly skies, avoiding Clark's murderous rage.10/10",National Lampoon's Vacation
138,RustyShacklefordd,"Fun, But Not a Classic.",7,25 July 2015,"Don't get me wrong Vacation is an enjoyable and funny movie, but it isn't exactly the classic comedy that some have made it out to be.The concept of the ultimate family vacation is executed well and anyone who's ever been on a less than stellar vacation will be able to relate to it. Chevy Chase is the best thing about the film and he has a real gift for delivery and comedic timing. It's hard to picture the film working quite as well with another actor in the lead role. The humor is very much in the vein of comedies of the 80's being silly and completely over-the-top. While the majority of the humor works, there are a few gross-out gags and repetition of jokes that don't work well that keep the movie from being great. Vacation is a lot fun and has more than a few laughs to over, but it's simplicity makes it a bit forgettable. Maybe it's lost some of it's charm since it was released it the 80's, but it's still a very enjoyable comedy that's worth watching. I'd still say that Christmas Vacation sit the best of the series though.",National Lampoon's Vacation
139,Lady Jasmine,"Disgusting, cruel and offensive",1,7 May 2002,"Ah what to say about vacation. The entire movie can be summed up in two words `Stupid' and `Horrendous'. In fact if it were possible to give negative ratings on the IMDB scale, I would do so for this movie.  I very seldom hate movies, but I cannot even stand the thought of this one. It is one thing to have slapstick humour, but this goes beyond the pale to just plain tasteless and insulting to the intelligence of the viewer. There is nothing funny about most of the jokes in this film (a grandmother dying in the car is not funny, it's sad and strapping her to the roof and leaving her in the rain is just plain disgusting and disrespectful). The entire movie, in fact all the Vacation movies (and there are FAR too many) is nothing more than a series of crude humour and disgusting jokes that go beyond the borders of black humour and into the realms of just plain cruel. If this is the best comedy the 80's could produce, you're better off looking at the classics or the moderns and leaving 80's in the dust.",National Lampoon's Vacation
140,Criti-Size,Fun Cross-Country Excursion,7,7 February 2004,This was a fun movie about a family vacation gone awry which spawned several sequels. Some of the humour is a bit dated but overall there are lots of laughs throughout. Great title track by Lindsay Buckingham. I'd give this film a 7 out of 10.,National Lampoon's Vacation
141,Aldri7,classic Chevy,6,21 May 2012,"If I could choose one movie that best represents what Chevy Chase and his brand of humor is all about, I'd probably go with ""National Lampoon's Vacation"". Chevy's own career often seemed to reflect the fortunes of his hapless alter-ego here, Clark Griswald, as many of his subsequent films were flops. So as much as I have always liked Chevy, I have never felt that he really had a lot of control or interest in the quality of his own work post-Saturday NIght Live. Its as though his on screen persona - aloof, disinterested, wise-assed, etc was also his real life persona. Also, Chevy was born into a lot of wealth and probably really didn't need the money. So all this I think spelled trouble for much of his film career. ""Vacation"" is possibly the best of the lot, and even here, there are times when he goes beyond comedy and lapses into behavior that just seems absurd for the sake of being absurd. But overall, ""Vacation"" is a funny film and it should touch anyone who has found themselves in similar circumstances while ""on the road"".OK, Chevy is Clark Griswald, a nerdy husband to Beverly D'Angelo and a father of two. The family lives in Chicago but want to drive to ""Wally World"" in Southern California for a few weeks of fun and rides. To get there, he buys an absurdly built ""family truckster"" (station wagon), packs the bags and off they go on their family vacation.Once outside of Chicago, problems surface immediately. Everything is terra incognito to Clark as he bumbles his way across farmland and prairie. The standard schtick is that he claims to be in control of everything thats going on, but he really doesn't have a clue. He makes things up and lies if he has to. Beverly D'angelo knows this. His kids know it. So ultimately, the joke is always on him despite how hard he tries to act casual and remain ""in command"". Sometimes, the result is great comedy. Other times, its a little absurd. But mostly you will enjoy and possibly relate to what they are going through as they wind their way to California. But once they depart Kansas and head to Colorado and Arizona, the movie starts to fall apart for me. Clark's bumbling and antics start to go over the top, and that peaks when they stay at a hotel in Arizona where Clark meets a mysterious blonde (Christie Brinkley) who seems to be following the family across the country. Also, there is a subplot involving an older relative (Imogene Cocoa) that borders on bad taste. So what started out as kind of a cute and funny film begins to escalate into absurdity and anger as Clark begins to get on EVERYONE""S nerves, including my own. In fact, you almost want to strangle him at some points. Its not the jokes with bad taste so much as the fact that his growing incompetence makes those jokes less funny. There is a balancing act going on here, and at some point, he crosses the line. For example, Beverly's ""as long as you don't tie me to a bumper"" line in reference to an incident earlier where Clark accidentally kills his cousin's dog, takes the shine off of the comedy and starts to turn it into something darker and less enjoyable.Anyway, but before they reach California, though, there is one more funny scene where they get lost and crash the car near Monument Valley, Arizona. Clark's ""father to son"" talk here is a classic, and he follows that with a dash through the desert looking for a gas station. When they recover the car later and Clark is lashed by an attendant for his stupidity in thinking he could find a gas station in the desert, he replies ""well, I'm from out of town"", another classic Chevyism. So that to me was a funny scene, and oh well, then we hit California...beyond that I probably should shut up or else I could be writing a spoiler here. Suffice it to say, things don't go well at Wally World either...and once again Clark's antics go over the top for me.But ""vacation"" is still a funny film worth checking out if you are a comedy fan. If you know and like Chevy, you will like the movie. And then I will close with one lingering question that always resurfaces for me every time I see this movie. The question is:""Would you dump Beverly D'Angelo for Christie Brinkley???""I dunno.......I really don't know...",National Lampoon's Vacation

From the idiotic premise of an idiot bringing his idiotic family on an idiotic journey to what I'll assume is an idiotic theme park. The journey involves doing idiotic things and meeting more idiotic family members. None of them funny or even remotely close to being funny. How this spawned a bunch of sequels and what is basically a remake is beyond me.

145,TorontoLiver,Vacation is a must-see movie!,10,24 May 2013,"This movie is really funny and really touching as well! There is nothing that I hated about this movie at all. This movie is a must see for anyone willing to take a deserved vacation, or just to be seeing it, and you must.Clark Griswold, played by Chevy Chase, is the stubborn but loving husband and dad who takes his family on a cross country drive from Chicago to Los Angeles, running into almost every problem imaginable! Also part of the wonderful cast is Beverly D'Angelo as Ellen, Clark's beautiful wife, Imogene Coca as Aunt Edna (the semi-antagonist), Anthony Michael Hall as Rusty, Dana Barron as Audrey, and many other people who helped make this movie such a success. The Griswolds first stop in St. Louis to see the Gateway Arch, but they end up in a scary, crime-ridden neighborhood. They have their car's hubcaps stolen and their car spray painted to say 'Honky Lips"", all while Clark asks for directions! In one of the funniest scenes, Clark dozes off behind the wheel and drives throughout the city asleep, but when it's over, everyone inside is fine. They then travel to pick up Aunt Edna, who hates Clark for no reason. They all get hilariously sidetracked when on the road! I loved this movie, and whoever reads this review must watch it later. This movie is touching, dramatic, and of course funny.",National Lampoon's Vacation
146,hmservant,"Not really ""good"" so much as ""classic """,7,30 October 2015,"I recently watched this movie again after not having seen it for some twenty-odd years and I was somewhat disappointed. It wasn't as good as I had remembered it being. It wasn't bad, just not that great. Like many people, I first saw it back in the 80's when it first came out. I was in my early teens then and thought it was decent. Now in my forties, I have a much better appreciation for it when I watch it because I have two children of my own and I see much (perhaps a little too much) of myself in the Clark W. Griswold character. I laughed out loud several times at Chevy Chase's portrayal of Clark being ""such a dad."" I don't know whether or not he had children of his own prior to making this movie, but he really nailed the ""typical dad"" character. Also, Beverly D'Angelo is the perfect combination of sexy and motherly in her role, and Anthony Michael Hall and Dana Barron are also terrific in their roles. Randy Quaid, back in his more stable days, gives a rather sane performance as the inimitable Cousin Eddie. There are many outstanding supporting performances in this movie. Having written that, however, I must state that the movie plays out as episodic, like one childhood memory after another strung together. Also, the movie is often silly; it contains elements that would have better left as ideas. For instance, it doesn't really make sense that Clark's old car would be driven straight from him trading it in to being compacted within minutes. It makes for a fairly funny sight gag, but doesn't come across as something that would actually happen. When it comes to ratings, the movie really deserves no more than six out of ten; however, there are so many funny moments and Chevy Chase is so good as Clark, I bump up my rating to seven out of ten.",National Lampoon's Vacation

This film is funny, stupid, dumb and very silly. It's also Hollywood making a buck, but what makes it not stick in the craw is that it remains funny.

Idea for the plot is fine, but it's extremely poorly executed. Acting is stiff and awkward, and the script feels like actors were improvising 98% of the time. There are two, maybe three, funny scenes, but that's not enough to call it a comedy.To sum it all up, I wouldn't recommend this movie to an enemy. It's just not worth it.",National Lampoon's Vacation

And it was just awesome! The dialogues were even better and the characters were so much better outlined.I swear that I will never see such a great movie in a dubbed version again!To any Germans in here: go get it on DVD (even though it is just in Mono) - and delete the video tape if you have recorded it from TV.",National Lampoon's Vacation
150,ThomasT1304,Classic movie of the 80s,9,30 July 2021,"This is probably the best and the funniest road trip movie I have ever seen in my life! The 80s had a bunch of very funny actors and comedians but Chevy Chase was the perfect choice to cast in this movie, he has chemistry with the rest of the cast and he can capture the perfect personality for the character of Clark (thinks he's smart but is certainly dim-witted). Of course the other actors do well too: Beverly D'Angelo, Randy Quaid, even the kids do a good job, and of course the cameo from John Candy as the Walley World security guard. John Hughes wrote this movie and he wrote movies such as Home Alone and Uncle Buck. He managed to use a recycled road trip plot and added enough bits to make it original. Harold Ramis as director who directed movies like Groundhog Day and Caddyshack. Ramis is a comedy legend! So this movie alone is filled with talent in front and behind the camera. So with the combination of Chevy chase in his prime and other talented actors as well as a talented writer and director, this movie is amazing. Definitely Chevy's best performance besides Fletch. I recommend this movie for anyone who enjoys 80s screwball comedy's. 9/10.",National Lampoon's Vacation

Christy Brinkley was all over my wall as a kid, she still looks great. John Hughes was in tuned with American family life in the 80's, most of his movies are on target and are still very watchable.

The film is absolutely hilarious and unforgettable from start to finish, Chevy Chase gives the funniest performance of his lifetime as Clark Griswold, a now classic character whose mishaps and hilarious choices trademark the Vacation series.It starts out with Chevy getting the families car for the road trip all the way to Los Angeles for the theme park Walley World, based off of Disney World. After that, everything that could possibly go wrong on a family road trip does. From the classic character of Cousin Eddie, one of the best slob performances i have ever seen to the complaining Aunt Edna to Chevy's complete mental breakdown at the finale, this film is great fun from start to finish. Only Chevy Chase could have pulled off Clark Griswold, just as John Belushi is the only man able to play Bluto in ""Animal House"" and Chris Farley was the only man for his performance in ""Tommy Boy"". A classic comedy, the first of the ""road comedy"" genre and the best of them by far.
