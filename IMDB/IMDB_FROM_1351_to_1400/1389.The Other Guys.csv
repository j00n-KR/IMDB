0,TheLittleSongbird,"Starts off very well, but then goes clunk just like that",1,1 April 2011,"I love films of all genres, regardless of how old they are. The Other Guys looked like a decent enough film. But watching The Other Guys was like watching a movie like The Bounty Hunter, the funny bits were actually shown in the trailers and previews. Don't get me wrong, The Other Guys does start off very well. The first fifteen minutes are quite funny, with an entertaining turn from Samuel L.Jackson. After that, it goes clunk, just like that, which is a real shame because I really wanted to like it.For me, a major part of the problem was Will Ferrell. While I am not a fan of his acting/shtick, I don't hate him or see him as a spawn of Satan or something or other. That said, he can be good especially in Anchorman and Stranger than Fiction, and Megamind was much better than expected too. However, Ferrell just isn't funny in The Other Guys. His acting here consists of a shtick(acting like a total wimp) that I have seen many times before and better. To make things worse, this shtick wasn't funny in the slightest, well actually it was for about three or so times but after that it got repetitive and tiresome.His co-star Mark Wahlberg thankfully fares a little better. His style of acting is more understated, and he did get one or two laughs from me. That in mind, Wahlberg was so understated he also verged on rather dull too and then there are some instances where he is actually annoying. He and Ferrell have no chemistry whatsoever, which alone ruined the movie, as a good buddy movie is sunk without a decent enough chemistry between the leads. The supporting cast are talented, Jackson does come off best, but Eva Mendes looks beautiful but has little to do other than act sexy and vapid and Michael Keaton who does have a knack of stealing the show when he is good is wasted.Another major part of the problem is the film's focus. There are times when it wants to be a comedy, then there are times and in sudden changes of shifts too when it strives to be an action-thriller-like film. It is really sad though that neither of these elements are done very well at all. The comedy is pretty much wretched, not just in the predictable gags but also in the terrible script, while the action is tedious.The plot is yet another disservice. It is a badly paced(the middle especially is too slow and full of awkward pauses) and derivative plot with few exciting or original moments to savour. And did I mention it was predictable as well. The direction is poor too, focuses too much on Ferrell and not enough on making a good enough script and story. It isn't just the story, direction or script that wastes the cast, there is also the way the characters are written. To be honest I hated every single one of them. All of them were clichéd, shallow and under-developed.Then there is the style of filming. The location work is quite nice, quite beguiling scenery and lighting, but the cinematography feels rushed and the film could have done with better editing, in other words editing that flowed much better into succeeding scenes. I personally found the soundtrack rather generic and boring, and I also thought it didn't fit much with the movie or its tone. The ending also epitomises how much downhill The Other Guys went after the beginning.Overall, I am sorry to say this, but The Other Guys was a mess. Although I saw it just recently, it is one of my least favourites of the year, in fact in my opinion only Fred:The Movie in 2010 was worse. 1/10 Bethany Cox",The Other Guys
1,bkoganbing,A Case That Will Make Them Heroes,6,30 December 2010,"The Other Guys in this film are Will Ferrell and Mark Wahlberg, a pair of NYC detectives who have gotten really far off the fast track in terms of career mobility. Wahlberg while on security duty at Yankee Stadium shot Derek Jeter mistaking him for a an unauthorized prowler, nobody's letting him live that down though I'm sure in Wahlberg's native Boston people were going to name children after him. As for Ferrell he worked before in the highly unglamorous forensic accounting division and one with computer knowledge can gain a detective's shield there. Being a true bureaucrat at heart he delights in doing the paperwork for the other detectives in the squad.But these two mismatched partners or at least Ferrell given his background get the scent of a massive defrauding scheme when they spot a Bernie Madoff type tycoon being kidnapped. Later on it's denied and the tycoon played by Steve Coogan shows up all hale and hearty and in a forgiving, but put out mood. The more they pursue this, the more warnings they get to back off, some of them real direct like a bomb going off at a mall account's office in New Jersey.Still our heroes persist and in the end the case will make them the hero of every cop in New York City. More I cannot say, but it will make up for shooting the Yankee captain.Ferrell is funny as always and Wahlberg has done comedy before and done it well. Eva Mendes is Mrs. Ferrell and it bugs Wahlberg no end how such a nerdy guy like Ferrell can land Eva Mendes as a life partner. Let's say that he's got a lot in his background as well, not typical for an accountant, but in a former line of work Ferrell was in you have to keep good accounts as well.Nice location cinematography in New York make The Other Guys something to enjoy and realize that heroes can come from the oddest places.",The Other Guys
2,SnoopyStyle,Great ridiculousness,8,28 September 2014,"P.K. Highsmith (Samuel L. Jackson) and Christopher Danson (Dwayne Johnson) are the best action hero rock star cops in the NYPD. They get into outlandish chases for nothing arrests. Everybody loves them. Martin (Rob Riggle) and Fosse (Damon Wayans Jr.) are the jokers. Captain Gene Mauch (Michael Keaton) is in charge. Then there are the Other Guys. Allen Gamble (Will Ferrell) is a naive paper pusher. His partner Terry Hoitz (Mark Wahlberg) is still trying to make up for shooting Derek Jeter. Gamble is eager to do paperwork for the heroes and Hoitz hates him for it. Highsmith and Danson finally kill themselves stupidly in a chase. Everybody wants to be the next hero cops. Hoitz forces Gamble to take on a high profile case. David Ershon (Steve Coogan) is an investment banker who lost $32 billion of Pamela Boardman (Anne Heche)'s fund. She demands that he replace the losses and he tries to go on the run. Gamble arrests Ershon on a scaffolding permit violation but a professional team takes him. On the personal side, Hoitz can't believe that Gamble is married to Sheila (Eva Mendes).I would have loved a buddy cop movie with Samuel L. Jackson and Dwayne Johnson. This is just as good in a completely different way. Ferrell is hilarious and Wahlberg is the perfect angry foil. The fighting partners have great chemistry. The angrier Wahlberg gets, the funnier the movie gets. Adam McKay has a great sense of the ridiculous. The story is stupid. The setups are insane. The dialog is hilarious. There are some gut busting laughs.",The Other Guys
3,kosmasp,The other comedy,5,31 December 2010,"I really wanted to love this. I even tried to laugh harder at some scenes, that I actually thought were working. I just couldn't entirely. One of the first mistakes (in my book), was to cast Samuel L. Jackson and Dwayne (the Rock) Johnson in small parts, to go against Mark Wahlberg and Will Ferrells main players (not literally). If you have guys with that charisma, with that ""swagga"", there is almost no chance for anyone else really being able to fill their shoes.So while I would love to watch the adventures of those two in a separate movie, the comedy felt weird and unstable in this one. Even a scene on a large building with Sam and Dwayne felt forced. They did something just to ""end"" the scene, that neither felt funny nor original or anything else. Apart from stupid that is. But I'm guessing that is something that some people might have had a laugh about. So you see comedy is defined by yourself.While it didn't work for me (and I don't think I'll be checking the extended cut, even if it contains more of the lovely Eva Mendes), that doesn't mean you won't enjoy it. I'm just saying ...",The Other Guys
4,jboothmillard,The Other Guys,4,16 January 2011,"From director Adam McKay (Anchorman: The Legend of Ron Burgundy, Talladega Nights: The Ballad of Ricky Bobby), this looked like a buddy cop comedy that may be reasonably funny, so I gave it a chance. Basically NYPD detectives P.K. Highsmith (Samuel L. Jackson) and Christopher Danson (Dwayne 'The Rock' Johnson) are the bad boys of the law and the best cops of New York City, until they make a hasty decision that turns out to be the wrong one, and they both die. Seemingly taking their place on the streets to clean it up, or rather trying to, are the guys on the desks further away, Allen Gamble (Will Ferrell) and Terry Hoitz (Mark Wahlberg) who stay in the office and don't see any action at all. They are a mismatched duo, and not going for the big guns, i.e. the hardest crimes of the city, they focus on investigating high-profile capitalist David Ershon (Steve Coogan) who is doing something financially shady. There is some big conspiracy concerning the New York Police department retirement funding, the criminals (not Ershon) are trying to scam $32 billion, and the result is some bad guys shooting guns and chasing the pair all over the city. Also starring Eva Mendes as Dr. Sheila Gamble, Michael Keaton as Captain Gene Mauch, Ray Stevenson as Roger Wesley, Lindsay Sloane as Francine, Natalie Zea as Christinith, Damon Wayans Jr. as Fosse, Anne Heche as Pamela Boardman, Brooke Shields, Tracy Morgan and Ice-T as Narrator. It may have an impressive cast list, there may be one or two humorous moments, but I'm afraid to confess I wasn't laughing much because of the silly choice of storyline for the opposite cops, I was hoping for another Lethal Weapon or something, it's only an alright action comedy. Okay!",The Other Guys
5,rmax304823,"Strenuous, Energetic, Weak.",4,12 April 2012,"Well, I wanted to like this film. I thought Mark Wahlberg delivered an entirely believable performance in ""The Departed"" and was quite good in ""Boogie Nights,"" especially for a newbie. And Michael Keaton in a supporting part is usually convincing, whether in comedy or drama. But everybody involved in this production is defeated by a script that reeks of adolescent jokes and contrived incongruity.Wahlberg and Will Ferrell are two mismatched cops who stumble without orders into an important embezzlement case involving a horde of people high up on the food chain. How's that for novelty? You want jokes? Some are reasonably pointed but this one is more typical. The NYPD are mostly testosterone-ridden goons who are into muscle cars and are fond of calling people ""fruits"". Wahlberg and Ferrell are riding in Ferrell's sensible little Prius hybrid coupe. Wahlberg remarks, ""I feel like I'm riding in a vagina."" There's a good deal of action. It goes without saying. What would a post-modern movie be like without a couple of fire balls and speeding car chases to distract the young girls and keep the young boys turgid? Only two people, I think, get killed but it's a comic moment. The two crooked cops wisecrack as they fall ten stories or so onto the pavement.But there is a cornucopia of wisecracks, most of them as flat as the two cops on the sidewalk. The whole affair reminded me somewhat of ""The Squeeze,"" another failed comedy in which Michael Keaton appeared, as did I. The frenzied action scenes always leave a bit of room for some fitful and discordant observation that's supposed to be hilarious. After they barely scrape through a monster car pile up, a passenger remarks, ""Boy, did you see that van tumble? I mean, it just went over and over."" But that's not funny. It's just silly.A few situations clear the bar. One involves Ferrell's being unable to approach his house to talk to his succulent wife. The place is being watched. So Ferrell and his wife trade messages by sending Ferrell's ancient mother-in-law hobbling back and forth across the street with her geriatric walker. The hoary old lady has to convey messages along the lines of, ""She wants you to ride her like a bucking bronco and do something with that electric razor on the end of the golf club."" The jokes might or might not be funny but the elderly actress, Viola Harris, convinces us that her protests -- ""That's too PERSONAL. I can't SAY it!"" -- are sincere. She's hilarious. That's more than can be said for Ferrell, who isn't funny at all as a police accountant drawn into field work. The part was made for the Alan Arkin of thirty years ago.Too bad.",The Other Guys
6,Tweekums,A funny film about a couple of far from high-flying cops,8,16 June 2016,"As this police comedy opens we see a pair of super-cops involved in a spectacular, and destructive, car chase to take down some criminals. When the chase is over they are fêted like rock stars these men don't do paperwork; that is left to the likes of Detectives Allen Gamble and Terry Hoitz the other guys. These two seldom leave the office as Gamble is a risk averse forensic accountant and Hoitz is less than popular following an incident where he shot a star basketball player. After the two star cops die the rest of the squad are keen to take on their mantle and Hoitz insists that they go out for once. While out Mantle arrests businessman Sir David Ershon for breaking scaffolding regulations! They don't realise that he is involved with some shady characters who kidnap him on the way to the police station. It soon becomes apparent that Ershon has powerful friends and dangerous enemies; Mantle and Hoitz will have to up their game if they are to solve the case.When I sat down to watch this I hoped it might be mildly amusing but soon found it much better than that as laugh out loud moments came thick and fast. I like how the film introduced us to the two super-cops, played by Samuel L. Jackson and Dwayne Johnson, before the actual stars of the film. The way these two operated then died was delightfully over the top. Will Ferrell and Mark Wahlberg are impressive in these lead roles; their characters are funny as is their constant bickering. Steve Coogan provides more laughs as Ershon and Ray Stevenson is suitably threatening as bad guy Roger Wesley; a role he plays straight rather than for laughs. The story isn't particularly strong but that doesn't matter as it serves to put the characters in various situations that provide the laughs. There are plenty of funny moments as well as some running gags. The best of these running gags was Hoitz's constant bafflement that Gamble keeps attracting beautiful women, including his 'plain' wife. The action is over the top in a way that suits the film. Overall I'd certainly recommend this to anybody wanting a good laugh and enjoys cop films.",The Other Guys
7,paul_haakonsen,Cocaine-covered action-comedy! And it works...,6,12 September 2010,"A cocaine covered Prius? And here I thought I had seen it all...Well, first of all, with an impressive cast like in this movie, you cannot go wrong. Sure enough, ""The Other Guys"" truly does deliver. This is a really, really nice action-comedy.Lets start off with the action. There is a lot of action in the movie, but funny action and action-action! And it works well when put together. It is not hilarious as most Jackie Chan movies, but it still comes off as a good result.And as for the comedy? Well, it is not the type that will have you sprawled on the floor, hunched over with tears streaking down your cheeks. The humor here is more like gentle slaps in the face, and there is a constant underlying humor throughout the entire movie.The actors in the movie were superbly cast. Just seeing Dwayne Johnson and Samuel L. Jackson in those two roles, that was off the chart. They were right for those whacked roles. And also hats off to Michael Keaton for his performance. But not forgetting the two main actors, the chemistry between Will Ferrel and Mark Wahlberg was so good. They worked so well opposite one another.""The Other Guys"" is good entertainment from start till end. There is a constant flow to the movie, and it never grows stale or boring. There is always something just waiting around the corner, and that really makes it worth watching it for.This is one of the better action-comedies I have seen in quite awhile. Compared to movies like ""Cop Out"" or ""Date Night"", then ""The Other Guys"" is off the charts. It beats other movies by a long shot. Thumbs up for this one.",The Other Guys
8,Quinoa1984,"a good & funny blockbuster comedy, which is all you can ask for in this case",7,18 November 2014,"So pleasant a relief, if not surprise (following this did the disappointing Step Brothers), it was that The Other Guys turned out to be funny. How funny it is, or how funny it will be for you, will depend on how much you can take of Ferrell and Mark Wahlberg as on-screen cops. But for my money it succeeded where Kevin Smith's Cop Out slipped; it takes on the conventions and stereotypes of the buddy-cop action-comedy movie, and does it a service by having funny lines, funny sequences, and (somewhat surprising) good action. I hesitate to discuss the plot because it is the thing that is least effective, perhaps intentionally so. All I can really report, or would want to, is that Steve Coogan plays a sort of shady Wall Street dealer who makes a bad deal, and owes some bad dudes (Ray Stevenson for example), and there's a series of diamond heists that are linked to his office.So who to get on the case? Why scene-stealers Samuel L. Jackson and Dwayne Johnson of course, the hot-shot cops who basically are the guys who one would usually see paired up in these movies. But they meet a rather unfortunate fate (I cannot describe it here, but it is one of the gut-busting moments of the year in terms of sudden, outrageous hilarity). So, who could take over? No one, really, except maybe Terry Hoitz (Wahlberg), a rather angry guy who got pulled off his usual detective work for accidentally shooting Derek Jeter (a fact he is painfully reminded of throughout the film), and, much less-so in terms of ambition, Allen Gamble (Ferrell), who works as an accountant for the cops. How they get put together, or how they go about the cases, is only somewhat relevant. The story takes some twists and turns but if you've seen one of these kinds of action-comedy cop movies you've seen them all.The Devil's in the Details, and it's in this that Ferrell and McKay get it right. True, some of the humor is pretty goddamn stupid, mostly with some of the physical gags like ""Good Cop Bad Cop"" that becomes ""Bad Cop Bad Cop."" Working much better here is Ferrell, who dials it down a little from his usual man-child roles and plays an adult (!) whose running gag is that he is married to and keeps getting hit on by insanely hot women. That is to Terry, Allen just sees his wife (Eva Mendes, very smoking hot) as ""cute"". There's also a side-track to Allen's time before being a cop, when he was a don't-call-me-a-pimp-but-I'm-a-pimp days in college, nicknamed ""Gator"" and with a mouth full of gold teeth.It's inspired feats and some really punchy dialog that keep things afloat, and that the film works this time- more-so than less-so- with the improvisational skills that Ferrell and surprisingly Wahlberg have on display. They make a good team, and other supporting players like Coogan and Michael Keaton do their parts as well (Keaton especially as a lieutenant-cum-Bed/Bath/Beyond manager has a riotous running gag of saying lines from TLC songs without realizing their origins).Lots of stupid fun to be had, and action that can be good on its own- i.e. scored to ""Icky Thump"" is a spectacular parody of a gun battle- or serving the comedy. I laughed, and I know that if I saw The Other Guys again I would laugh again, and maybe just as hard in the parts I look forward to. Sometimes, despite only a passable plot and a few cardboard characters, that's enough.",The Other Guys
9,tavm,Will Ferrell and Mark Wahlberg provide plenty of good laughs in The Other Guys,6,9 August 2010,"If one didn't see the trailers on TV and in theatres or look at the beginning credits, one would think-judging from the beginning sequence-that the stars of this comedy-action movie were Samuel L. Jackson and Dwayne Johnson. They're emphasized a lot early on but when they disappear halfway through, that's when the plot involving mismatched partners Will Ferrell and Mark Wahlberg get into gear. I must say right here that Ferrell and Wahlberg get quite a few good laughs out of their contrasting personalities especially when the latter wonders constantly how the former gets so many hot women. Also, seeing Ferrell explaining the impossibility of certain things whenever Wahlberg threatens him is also pretty hilarious. Also good are Eva Mendes as Will's wife, Steve Coogan as financial wizard David Ershon, and Michael Keaton as the superior officer who also works at Bath and Beyond. Not everything works but director/co-writer Adam McKay keeps things moving nearly smoothly throughout.",The Other Guys
10,edwagreen,The Other Guys is Beyond Stupidity **,4,29 May 2011,"How fortunate Samuel L. Jackson, who plays a super-macho officer in this film, dies off early. That should have been the same for the writing and all of this film as well. Period.The film details 2 bumbling officers in the tradition of Officer Clouseau of the Pink Panther fame. They try to step up when Jackson and his partner die in a ridiculous scene.As the officers, Ferrell and Wahlberg uncover a tycoon's misdeeds but are constantly thwarted along the way by the tycoon's private force and others on the NYC police force.Some of the antics are crazy such as the shooting of Derek Jeter and Ferrell being persuaded by other cops to shoot off his gun in the office. Another scene includes police passing a gun around in a New York City classroom and allowing a young female student to go on a police chase with them. Stupid best describes all of this.In reality, the picture doesn't say very nice things about the police so I shall not say very good things about this film.",The Other Guys
11,BandSAboutMovies,Fun!,6,26 May 2020,"Between Anchorman, Stepbrothers and The Campaign, Adam McKay has made plenty of funny films with Will Ferrell, who stars in this with Mark Wahlberg. Points for Samuel Jackson and Dwayne Johnson playing against type here in a movie where two desk cops learn how to be the kind of supercops you only see on TV.Allen Gamble and Terry ""Yankee Clipper"" Hoitz - called because he shot Derek Jeter and cost the team the World Series - are up against the villainous Sir David Ershon (Steve Coogan) in this one. It's very much a hijinks ensue type of film, but I really enjoyed Michael Keaton as their Captain, Eva Mendes as Allen's wife and Ice-T as the narrator.Wrestling fans will be happy to know that Billy Gunn and Road Dogg show up, too.I had fun with this one, as it's written and edited really well. Your enjoyment of it depends on how much you like the leads, but it got a lot of laughs here.",The Other Guys
12,dbborroughs,Will Ferrell finally has a lead role where he's good. Unfortunately the direction works against him.,6,28 August 2010,"When the super cops of the force meet with tragedy, the other guys, two cops forced into desk jobs, must step up and fill their shoes.One of the best Will Ferrell movies has some real genuine laughs that are undercut by a director who needs to have his head examined. Forgive displeasure but here's a film with a good script, a great cast and its put together in such away that when ever Ferrell is on screen it stops moving as if waiting for him to do something funny. Ferrell, who I don't like normally, has a character here but he's continuously undercut by a director who stops everything with pregnant pauses that don't belong.What the hell was he thinking? While I'm very happy to have seen a Will Ferrell character I like I hate that its in a movie that is just okay and not great.",The Other Guys
13,writers_reign,The Surreal McKay,6,18 September 2010,This opened in London in a ho-hum week and whilst the Press were mostly negative virtually all the reviews stressed that the first half hour was hilarious but one a plot of sorts kicked in it tended to go downhill. On the strength of that I decided to check it out. I didn't find anything all that excruciatingly funny in the first half hour or indeed at any point but it was a fairly painless way to kill a couple of hours. One think the Press did get right: Steve Coogan was pathetic and as unfunny as he continually strives to be. Much - possibly too much - is made of Ferrell's nerd proving to be a babe magnet and apart from that the plot is pretty much formulaic.,The Other Guys
14,zardoz-13,Half-Baked Cop Buddy Picture,4,9 August 2010,"""Saturday Night Live"" comedian Will Ferrell has made a mint out of playing morons. He delivers another hilarious performance as a moronic New York Police Department detective in ""Talladega Nights"" director Adam McKay's ""The Other Guys,"" an ambitious but half-baked parody of slam-bang police thrillers. Oscar nominated actor Mark Wahlberg of ""The Departed"" co-stars as Ferrell's pugnacious NYPD partner. Unfortunately, Wahlberg displays none of Ferrell's comic genius. Nothing Wahlberg does registers as remotely amusing. He is either screaming at Ferrell out of spite or skewering his partner's masculinity. Wahlberg appears to be channeling Joe Pesci from the Martin Scorsese classics ""Goodfellas"" and ""Casino."" Alas, Wahlberg is no Pesci. The funniest thing next to Ferrell is the non-stop ridicule reserved for our hero's red Prius. One cop calls it a 'tampon on wheels.' Surprisingly, the car is far funnier than Wahlberg. McKay and ""Land of the Lost"" scenarist Chris Henchy struggle with little success to combine a formulaic police buddy picture comedy with a complex white-collar crime conspiracy involving a shady investment banker. Think of ""The Other Guys"" as a mediocre ""Police Academy"" wannabe with half of the laughs. Primarily, the humor grows out of the irony that a couple of pencil-pushing desk jockeys replace two loose-cannon celebrity crime busters as the top cops in the Big Apple. The stunt work is terrific. The opening gag where a heroic pair of testosterone-driven cops crash their sports car into a double-decker bus to arrest several shooters for a misdemeanor amount of narcotics is impressive. Alas, McKay and Henchy make some poor narrative choices. First, they kill off the two most charismatic characters, Highsmith and Danson, and then struggle to replace them with two boring morons.NYPD Detectives P.K. Highsmith (Samuel L. Jackson of ""Pulp Fiction"") and Christopher Danson (Dwayne 'The Rock' Johnson of ""The Tooth Fairy"") are a macho pair of ""Lethal Weapon"" cops who refuse to let details complicate their roguish antics. Although they make spectacular arrests, they also create spectacular property damage. Nevertheless, everybody loves them so they can flout the rules. As ""The Other Guys"" opens, Highsmith and Danson are in hot pursuit of a gang armed with assault rifles. Danson has jumped atop their Escalade, but he doesn't stick around long after they perforate the roof. Danson dives back onto Highsmith's car, bounds off the hood onto the roof, and slings himself back into the front passenger seat. The villains blast Highsmith's car so the hood flies back against the windshield and blinds them. Highsmith shoots off the hood hinge. Too late! He plows into a double-decker bus as the villains appear to get away. Danson commandeers the double-decker bus with Highsmith's car still stuck in it. Danson careens after the hoods, whips the double-decker around and the maneuver launches Highsmith's car at the hoods with Highsmith blasting away with two pistols. After Highsmith and Danson receive their medals, Precinct Captain Gene Mauch (Michael Keaton of ""Batman"") solicits somebody to complete their paper work. These two cops have never wasted their time with paperwork. Detective Allen Gamble snaps at the opportunity to polish off the Highsmith and Danson paperwork. Not long afterward, Highsmith and Danson leap to their deaths when trying to thwart a team of acrobats who wield a wrecking ball to smash their way into a jewelry store and heist $79-thousand in stones. Nobody knows why Highsmith and Danson jumped from 20 stories up and hit the cement hard.A milquetoast forensic accountant who prefers to file paperwork, Gamble (Will Ferrell of ""Old School"") likes to hum the S.W.A.T. theme and stay in the precinct office rather than nab bad guys on the streets. His idea of busting loose is to floor the gas pedal of his Prius and play the Little River Band. Allen's partner, Detective Terry Hoitz (Mark Wahlberg of ""Date Night""), is just the opposite. Terry dreams of making the big bust. He suspects drug deals behind every crime. Sadly, Terry has been confined to a desk and stuck with Allen. The skeleton in Terry's closet is he accidentally shot New York Yankees baseball slugger Derek Jeter in the leg during the seventh game of the World Series. Yes, the Yankees lost! Everybody in the precinct now calls Terry 'the Yankee Clipper.' Naturally, Terry hates Allen, but he lives by the venerable ""partner's code"" which requires a partner to back up his partner no matter what the circumstance. Ironically, Allen's obsession with paper work prompts them to arrest British investment banker Sir David Ershon (Steve Coogan of ""Tropic Thunder"") who is up to his chin in a grand scheme to steal $32-billion from the NYPD Pension Fund to cover the loses of another Wall Street titan.The best scene between Ferrell and Wahlberg is the lion-versus-the-tuna tale. Terry tells Allen that if he were a lion he would rip him to shreds as easily as a lion could a tuna. Terry destroys the lack of logic in Terry's threat with own flawed logic. He claims that the tuna would gang up on the lion. Later they would construct an oxygen apparatus to allow them to live out of water so they could stalk and attack lions on dry land. The running joke throughout ""The Other Guys"" is nerdy Allen is a babe magnet. Sexy chicks come on to him and ignore Terry. Terry is floored when he meets Allen's hot chick wife, Dr. Shelia Gamble (Eva Mendez of ""Training Day""), who is crazy about her husband. ""The Other Guys"" swerves erratically between scenes of Allen and Terry bonding to the chaos they create after they arrest Ershon. The ""Grand Theft Auto"" chases, the blazing gunfights, and the audacious wrecking ball jewelry heist look cool but these scenes seem out of place in this lackluster buddy comedy. Ultimately, ""The Other Guys"" runs out of both momentum and laughs long before it runs out of plot.",The Other Guys
15,grantss,"Great, and surprisingly so",8,28 December 2015,"Great, and surprisingly so. I wasn't expecting much from this - thought it would be the sort of low-brow stuff Will Ferrell usually does, but this works perfectly. Screamingly funny.Story is so-so, but that was always going to be merely a platform for the witty, often tongue-in-cheek, dialogue and Ferrell and Mark Wahlberg's comedic abilities.Strangely, Ferrell plays the straight role to Wahlberg's over-the- top intense performance, and it works. Wahlberg is insanely funny and steals the show.Great performances from a star-studded supporting cast: Steve Coogan (especially), Michael Keaton, Eva Mendes, Ray Stevenson, Dwayne Johnson, Samuel L Jackson, Anne Heche, Damon Wayans Jr, Rob Riggle, plus some interesting cameos from Derek Jeter and Brooke Shields as themselves.",The Other Guys

17,neil-476,Wahlberg impresses,8,22 September 2010,"Supercops Samuel L Jackson and Dwayne Johnson start this movie off with an outrageous sequence typical of bombastic action thrillers. Events soon conspire to throw the improbable partnership of deskbound accountant cop Will Ferrell and disgraced would-be action cop Mark Wahlberg into the limelight, however, as they pursue an unlikely investigation in the fact of mishaps and pressure to drop it.This film generated a lot of laughter throughout its length. I'm not a big Ferrell fan, but his character was amiable and often funny. Bigger laughs came from Wahlberg, however, who showed considerable comic chops deadpanning to Ferrell's broader character. And Eva Mendes as Ferrell's wife was both funny and sexy. Jackson and Johnson clearly enjoyed sending themselves up. Michael Keaton did the best he could with a part which was not written helpfully, and poor old Steve Coogan was swimming against the tide a bit.But overall this was an enjoyable movie.",The Other Guys
18,ferguson-6,Gator and the Yankee Clipper,5,8 August 2010,"Greetings again from the darkness. Much of Will Ferrell's box office success has occurred thanks to his collaborations with Adam McKay. This includes Step Brothers, Talladega Nights, and Anchorman. McKay's long history at Saturday Night Live is often on display in his movies, but never more than during The Other Guys. While there is some semblance of story, the film often has the feel of individual skits.The first skit involves two supercops played by Samuel L Jackson and Dwayne ""The Rock"" Johnson. Of course, the kicker is that they really aren't great cops, but masters of Public Relations. Will Ferrell and Mark Wahlberg are partners and the titular 'other guys'. We get minimal background on each but quickly understand that Ferrell's cop comes from accounting and is obsessed with regulations and safety. Wahlberg was a former rising star until an unfortunate accident involving Derek Jeter snuffed out his promotions.Obviously, there needs to be a super case that these two solve and it involves a corporate financing scheme with Steve Coogan. The story itself is really unimportant (luckily) and the humor is derived from individual moments between Ferrell and Wahlberg, that same duo and Eva Mendes, or scenes with Michael Keaton.There are a couple of running gags that work (hot girls are always hitting on Ferrell, Wahlberg's dancing, Keaton and TLC), and the best visual gag is an extended freeze frame montage set in a pub. It is pure comic genius. On the downside, I was really baffled as to the over-the-top approach taken by Mark Wahlberg. His anger and bitterness were so big that it has to be considered a spoof. However, if you try to view the film as a spoof, it just doesn't work (outside of Samuel L Jackson).Overall, this one has the laughs you would expect but is certainly not at the class of Anchorman. Comedy remains one of the most difficult film genres, and McKay remains one of our best hopes.",The Other Guys
19,anaconda-40658,A Tribute to the Regular Guy.,10,25 August 2015,"The Other Guys (2010): Dir: Adam McKay / Cast: Will Ferrell, Mark Wahlberg, Samuel L. Jackson, Dwayne Johnson, Eva Mendes: Hilarious comedy about those unappreciated of us all. Will Ferrell and Mark Wahlberg play frustrated desk cops who yearn for bigger cases. They embark upon a case involving police corruption and fraud that lands them in position to prove themselves. Director Adam McKay's fourth collaboration with Ferrell who plays the desk cop with the hot wife and completely oblivious to it all. They both collaborated on Anchorman and Talladega Nights, both of which are quite funny. Wahlberg plays a hot head cop who cannot communicate socially. Both are often the brunt of jokes at the station but even worse is their inability to communicate with each other. We know that they will eventually prove themselves but the big surprise is the dealing with hot shot cops played by Samuel L. Jackson and Dwayne Johnson. They are celebrated cops who are involve in a massive action scene that opens the film. A chase scene is followed by recognition then another action scene that will take viewers totally by surprise in what ends up being a big laugh at a bad joke. Eva Mendes is adorably funny as Ferrell's ""plain"" wife who is supportive and sexy, oblivious to him but not to Wahlberg. While the film is one of the funniest of the year, it also stands up for those of us who have often been overlooked in life in favour of those who take their success for granted. End credits point out insight into what the underlining message regards and how those other guys often make bigger differences. Score: 10 / 10",The Other Guys
20,FlashCallahan,Desk pop!!,7,19 September 2010,"Terry Hoitz's past mistakes in the line of duty and Allen Gamble's reluctance to take risks have landed them the roles of the ""Other Guys"", disgraced New York City police detectives relegated to filling out paperwork for cocky hero cops Danson and Highsmith. The mismatched duo must look past their differences when they take on a high-profile investigation of shady capitalist David Ershon and attempt to fill the shoes of the notoriously reckless officers they idolise.Being a big fan of Ferrall and Wahlberg, I was expecting a hell of a lot from this film, and i got what I asked for In the first two acts, which were laugh out loud funny. But not from your typical Ferrall screaming and shouting shtick he seems to do in every other one of his films. it was the tension between the two characters in the first half that had me laughing.The lion and the tuna piece has to be some of the most silliest and pointless dialogue written in a film in a while, but it worked, and a simple line such as 'we would find out where you live' is turned into priceless comedy.Saying that that, the story is about as good as Lethal weapon 3, namely is about some money being owed to someone else, and if it isn't paid, there's trouble. its that simple. simple enough to call it a sub-plot.The real thing here is the role reversal between the two leads through out the film. One seems insecure, the other doesn't and then you realise that these are not the people you expected them to be.The writing and narration are fluid and hilarious, but with most buddy cop comedies, it runs out of steam long before the end. Jackson and Johnson are great in self deprecating roles, and Keaton should do a lot more comedy.It's the sort of film that has spurts of genuine hilarity, and then it just tails off onto annoying characters who offer nothing for the film and slow it down too much.but it's a lot better than Talladega nights, so it can't be that bad.one of the better comedies of the year.",The Other Guys

22,zetes,Definitely funny,7,8 August 2010,"Will Ferrell and Mark Wahlberg star as two loser cops in New York City who stumble upon a big case involving Steve Coogan as a corrupt investment banker. It's very silly and very typical of a Will Ferrell comedy, so you have to be a fan to have a reason to watch this. I am, and I enjoyed it. I wouldn't put it up there with his best films (Anchorman, Blades of Glory and Step Brothers, in my opinion), but it's definitely worth checking out. Wahlberg makes a nice partner. He's very funny when he gets intense. Ferrell plays a more laid-back, nerdy character in this one. There are a lot of really funny gags. I loved, for instance, the whole running gag about Ferrell being able to attract women who should be far out of his league. Eva Mendes plays his wife, and near the beginning of the film Wahlberg meets her for the first time, attending a dinner at Ferrell's place, and he can't even believe it. The film misses a lot of opportunities, too, partly because they needed to put out a PG-13 rated movie (I hope we get an unrated director's cut; it might be a better film). But even stuff like the partners' rival cops (Rob Riggle and Damon Wayans Jr.(!?!?)), who feel like they should have been a bigger part of the film, doesn't get much in the way of laughs. Michael Keaton has a decent role as the Captain who also has a second job as manager of a Bed, Bath and Beyond so his son can ""explore his bisexuality at NYU"" (a hilarious joke that really needed to be explored just a tad more). The film ends with a downright odd and out-of-place Power Point presentation of how investment bankers are defrauding America, set to a Rage Against the Machine song. Who knew we were secretly watching a Michael Moore film?",The Other Guys

24,DICK STEEL,A Nutshell Review: The Other Guys,10,30 September 2010,"There are probably three key reasons why I predict this action comedy will be a hit and live up to its potential – the pairing of what's probably deserving of a movie of its own with Samuel L. Jackson and Dwayne Johnson as the toughest, meanest, no nonsense cops in New York City whose careers are nothing but laden with action, the main focus on the quirky pairing of Mark Wahlberg and Will Ferrell as complete opposites to their peer's partnership and crime-busting success rate, and Eva Mendes herself for her firm and perky you-know- whats, spouting lines seen in the trailer that so far has never failed to elicit laughter.While the film may be hidden under the guise of the classic cops and robbers tale, it is Adam McKay and Chris Henchy's story that made it stand out, because of its relevance and commentary of today's real world woes. Like how the action sequences involving the old school cops become ultra exaggerated and complete with what I'd like to think as deliberate B-grade film special effects, if not to keep costs down in filming along the busy streets of a major metropolitan city, it accentuates how the old ways of doing things will not work, where heroes and villains are no longer clearly and cleanly defined. Aiming squarely at the financial crisis where problems or opportunity for problems stem from financial accounts and affects a lot more people across the board, the skill sets required to solve a crime go beyond just normal policing work.So with the development of more savvy crooks comes the need for an appropriate response. Out goes the traditional techniques now seen as dinosaurs, and in comes a new breed of problem solvers where the everyday common man, each steeped in their own skillsets, competencies and diligence for menial work sometimes, play that very important role. This is the story of the unsung heroes, and the other guys who are left with filling the void of new opportunity. And the film's pairing of Will Ferrell and Mark Wahlberg as detective partners couldn't add more fun into this definition of embracing change and the differences in others, never to judge anyone, as the adage goes, by the book.Ferrell plays Allen Gamble, a mild-mannered cop whose background in forensics accounting means he's one suited for a desk role in the force, never ever volunteering for the more glamorous aspects of police work, preferring instead to work behind the scenes hammering out reports. This of course to the irritation of whiny partner Terry Hoitz (played by Wahlberg who hammed up his usual macho alpha-maleness here), who yearns to see action and doing his contribution to clean up the streets, if not for that hilarious career limiting move that had stalled his prospect for promotion. Reporting to Michael Keaton's Captain Gene Mauch who has this penchant for unknowingly quoting TLC, this duo will go through a rather satisfying cliché of getting to know each other, warts and all, before finally accepting their differences en route to cracking a big case.No sooner than the get go are we treated to the very first action sequence of the film that's so much fun and laughter even that your appetite is whet and leaving you clamouring for more. I for one will put up my hand should there be a feature film based on Sam L. Jackson's and Dwayne Johnson's characters since they're totally over the top, and I suppose as a comedy they nailed their roles and were right on the money with personifying self-importance and arrogance, having little patience for their support team, never hesitating to shoot or belittle them, and it's quite the pity we don't get to see more, as they had to make way for the titular guys to take over, so with that goes some of the fun that came right from the start.The writers McKay and Henchy have developed extremely likable caricatures, which every cast member especially Ferrell and Wahlberg delivering with a complete repertoire of slapstick and with with aplomb. Between the two leads there are occasional moments where you'll find that they irritate, especially when Wahlberg turns all angry and whiny at the same time, with Ferrell too having to seem that he's been reigned in to play such a restrained character, with moments where the glint in the eye to explode just shows, then dissipates. Still, probably the best scene here were the three way dynamics which included Eva Mendes, some of which you'll already have seen in the trailers.Adam McKay had directed a fair bit of Will Ferrell comedies such as Step Brothers and Talladega Nights amongst others with varying degrees of success where the comedy's more hit than miss, but The Other Guys really went for that rip-roaring laugh a minute offering which lived up to its potential. A definite contender in my shortlist for favourite films of this year as it's been some time since I laughed so hard during a comedy, one that had its message not lost in laughter. Don't leave the cinema just yet when the end credits roll as you'll be taken through a fantastically done animated piece on the financial crisis we face today as well as the absurdity of pay structures, and between the haves and the have nots / other guys, before one final joke cum outtake between Ferrell and Wahlberg.",The Other Guys
25,SimonJack,"Weak plot, script and direction in this humorless trifle",3,13 August 2017,"The Columbia folks must have thought the pairing of Will Farrell and Mark Wahlberg would be a good match for a comedy. But it certainly doesn't work in this film. The comedy in ""The Other Guys"" is thin at best. That weakness probably has to be chalked up mostly to the writers, for the script seems strained at times. The actors are hesitant in their dialog in places. It all smacks of a combination of a poor script, weak directing, and a plot that just doesn't register. The early scenes with Dwayne Johnson and Samuel Jackson as Danson and Highsmith are even less funny. It's obviously supposed to be a spoof of fast action cop movies. While that's quite clear, it's also clearly a weak and seemingly cheap effort to launch this movie. The only character of some interest is Captain Gene Mauch, played very well by Michael Keaton. Ferrell is just fair but Wahlberg and the rest strike me as the type that filled the B movies of the past. This film shows what Hollywood seems to have evolved into in much of its output so far in the 21st century. It seems obsessed with sex, and this film itself seems a fetish. Especially the scenes in which Ferrell's Allen Gamble and Eva Mendes as Dr. Sheila Gamble, pass descriptive sexual encounter desires to one another through her mother. That seemed to me to be just plain stupid. This is a film any thinking person will want to skip. Those who enjoy good comedies would soon be bored and then rightly miffed at spending any money for this flat piece.",The Other Guys
26,Mr-Fusion,With guys like these on the streets . . .,6,5 November 2021,"A pretty good buddy-cop movie; decent, likable. I think the only reason The Other Guys doesn't rate higher for me is because most of the fun was with the supporting cast (The Other Other Guys?). Specifically, The Rock and Samuel L. Jackson. They open the movie as the hilarious A-Team that soaks in all the glory; the sweet ride, the nice duds. Plus, it's all gone to their heads and they're hopelessly self-satisfied. But they're not around for the whole movie, and once they go, Michael Keaton steps in to pick up the slack. And I love me some Michael Keaton, but these are all side players. The movie's focus is Will Ferrell and Mark Wahlberg, and they pale in comparison. This is an Adam McKay joint and I didn't see that coming, but there it is.",The Other Guys
27,namashi_1,Time-Pass...,6,23 October 2010,"Adam McKay's 'The Other Guys' is a Time-Pass, harmless film, with some really moments and super performances working for it. A decent success at the box office and some positive reviews made up for it's makers.'The Other Guys' is about 2-under-rated cops, who take charge after their legendary seniors die. The film works because of the chemistry between it's lead cast. Will Ferrell and Mark Wahlberg's on-screen chemistry is indeed brilliant. Ferrell rips it up as a comical, dumb but efficient cop, while Wahlberg shines as the no-non-sense cop.Among other performances, Michael Keaton delivers a superb performance as the Captain. Eva Mendes as Ferrell's sultry wife does very well. Dwayne Johnson and Samuel L.

28,Smells_Like_Cheese,A little disappointed but it was still funny,6,17 August 2010,"If there is one thing that I love, it's action movies, even buddy cop films. So when I saw the trailer for The Other Guys, I knew I wanted to see it. Even though I'm not a Will Ferrell fan, I love Mark Wahlberg and the whole idea about this film seemed just great. The Other Guys delivers in with the laughs and action, but there's unfortunately something missing from it that could have made it into a great film. When I saw the trailer, I thought I had the film figured out, Sam Jackson and The Rock are these two awesome action cops who are just unstoppable but then we compare to the average Joe's who aren't Arnold Schwartzenegger and Bruce Willis. Unfortunately, Sam Jackson and The Rock are taken away in the first 10 minutes of the film and we're stuck with Mark and Will for the rest of the time. The first half of the film was really funny, there were a lot of good jokes and I just had a great time laughing. I wish that they kept Sam and The Rcok around because the guys that Will and Mark were competing with were dorks and didn't work. The ending of the film fell flat and didn't know when to quit.Detectives Danson and Highsmith are pursuing a group of robbers in a van. After a brief firefight that results in the hood of Highsmith's car getting blown into the windshield, the two inadvertently crash into the side of a double decker bus. Danson drives it after the robbers and meticulously slingshots the trapped car out the other side of the bus and crashing into a building, inexplicably surviving. But they are not our hero's of the film as they are quickly killed off. Detective Allen Gamble, a forensic accountant who's more interested in paperwork than hitting the streets, and Detective Terry Hoitz, who has been stuck with Allen as his partner ever since shooting Derek Jeter. Allen and Terry idolize Danson and Highsmith and receive absolutely no respect from the other officers. When an opportunity arises for Terry and Allen to step up, things don't quite go as planned. As things get worse, Allen and Terry are forced to split up. However, Allen still tries to solve the crime on his own even though Terry thinks it is a dead end. He finally gets credible evidence and earns his gun back. Allen finally convinces Terry to rejoin him and as things begin to go well, the other guys of course realize they are not Danson and Highsmith.Now The Other Guys is good enough for a rental, there are some really great laughs. I did love the joke between Mark, Will and Eva Mendes. Will's character is this straight laced accountant, but is married to a bombshell like Eva and Mark just can't figure out why she married him. Also Will's ex's are these beautiful women, Mark is just dumbfounded but it was a great joke. Even though I hated that The Rock and Sam were taken so quickly, their exit scene was beyond hilarious. Like I said, it's not a bad movie by any means, it just didn't know how to end and had several pointless scenes/stories. Mark has an ex love who wasn't much purpose for the film, the villain had too much plot for a simple story and some of the jokes dragged on a little too long. I really wanted to love this film, even though Will Ferrell was in it, I even accepted him and went along with the story. I was just a little disappointed because the movie had so much more potential. It just needed a little more work, because frankly The Rock and Sam Jackson could have carried the film alone with their story and would have been a great comedy. In fact, I think I have an idea don't you get any ideas! I'm off to Hollywood.6/10",The Other Guys
29,DKosty123,Belt High Fastball Down The Middle,6,9 August 2010,"A big name cast takes a script which is OK & makes an OK movie. There are points in the film where there are laughs. There are points where the throw away lines are faster than the audience. Will Farrell has done better material than this & there are worse films like Bewitched which would get my vote as worst Will Farrell film ever. Still while this one gets off too a fast start, the pitch is there too hit out of the park, but the ball stays in the park due to the strength not being there to complete the hit.There is plenty of bat here as the cast has loads of talent. There is an umpire, catcher, pitcher, & a bat & ball. What is missing is the juice. The laughter comes like someone taking steroids, & then trying to keep up with the rest of the world without crashing.Still, this one is OK. There are lots of decent things going on & Farrell is pretty good here. The plot is a police precinct where there are hero cops & then there are the office paperwork hounds. Then, for an insane moment, the hero cops make a mistake & jump out of a building too their deaths. After the funeral, the paperwork hounds have to step into the hero role.

I liked some of Adam McKay previous film's such as Anchorman: The Legend of Ron Burgundy and Talladega Nights: The Ballad of Ricky Bobby, but hated this movie. The only good parts of this film is the first 10 or 15 minutes of the movie with Samuel L. Jackson and The Rock. The rest of the movie, I don't even remember or want to remember. The jokes aren't even funny in this and it drags on and on about that one unfunny joke for like 5 minutes or even more, felt like it was longer though. Like some reviewers said, this movie is a insult to audiences intelligence and I walked out with a head ache from the pure stupidity and not even it being funny at all.

31,sddavis63,A Lot Of Silliness With Very Little Humour,2,16 August 2010,"I have no argument with stupid movies in some cases. Sometimes they're actually quite funny. Take Will Ferrell's turn in ""Anchorman"" for example. That was a stupid and very funny movie that required no significant thought to enjoy. I was hoping ""The Other Guys"" would accomplish the same. It didn't. Ferrell and Mark Wahlberg played a couple of loser cops who are always in the background, being overshadowed by the other more glamorous and exciting cops. They're the quintessential ""other guys"" who are never in on the action and never get the glory. They stumble upon a big fraud case and set themselves to making a splash by solving it.OK. Maybe there was some potential there. But it was inconsistent, jumping around from ridiculous and unnecessary plot point to ridiculous and unnecessary plot point, introducing way too much, from Hoitz' (Wahlberg) dancing abilities (learned to make fun of queers and fairies) to Gamble's (Ferrell) past as a college pimp and his inexplicable attractiveness to beautiful women. It was just silly - and unfortunately it wasn't a funny silly; it was just plain silly. Dumb. Stupid. Come up with any other similar word and it will fit perfectly well. The highlights were some equally silly (but at least fun) car chase scenes at the beginning and end of the movie that at least drew you into the story (at least until it really got going) and left you with a bit of a smile.

32,Hellmant,One of the most genius cop buddy pairings ever!,8,14 October 2010,"'THE OTHER GUYS': Four Stars (Out of Five) Another teaming of writer / director Adam McKay with funny-man superstar Will Ferrell (Others being 'SATURDAY NIGHT LIVE', 'ANCHORMAN', 'TALLADEGA NIGHTS' and 'STEP BROTHERS'). In one of the most genius cop buddy pairings ever Ferrell is also teamed with Mark Wahlberg. After watching the movie I can't think of a more hilarious odd couple pairing in recent memory. To top it off you have Samuel L. Jackson and Dwayne 'The Rock' Johnson in one of the most brilliant cop action movie spoofs ever, all though brief. Not to mention Michael Keaton as a very humorous police Captain. There's also the stunning Eva Mendes and at least a dozen other great supporting characters. The movie has all the ingredients of a comedy classic.Ferrell and Wahlberg play Allen Gamble and Terry Hoitz, two New York City police officers who spend all of their time doing paperwork in the office due to Gamble's fear of action and Hoitz's past blunder shooting a star baseball player, Derek Jeter (playing himself). They idolize the two star detectives P.K. Highsmith (Jackson) and Christopher Danson (Johnson) but when they're killed Hoitz can't wait for the opportunity to get back in the action and be a hero again. So when they stumble upon a breakout case Hoitz drags Gamble with him on an obsessed mission to save the day. The movie is just one wild action scene and outrageous joke after another from here on out.The movie is about as funny as they get, from start to finish, but as this is it's greatest strength it's also it's biggest weakness. There's no real drama or true emotion (other than briefly, due to the performances). A truly great comedy requires real developed characters with honest problems. There needs to be some break from the laughter to establish real situations which makes the comedy that much stronger. When it's just one hilarious joke after another the laughter somewhat loses it's power and gets exhausting, especially at an hour and forty seven minutes (which is way too long for a slapstick comedy). The only time the movie has any real drama and heartfelt emotion is when it comes to it's conclusion and the credits roll. It's here that the movie delivers it's moral message by rolling statistics on how much big wig executives make compared to true heroes like cops, nurses, teachers and others. It's the 'other guys' that the spotlight is not on that make our world worth living but society puts the value on self centered assholes. That's the message the movie is trying to drive home and it only truly resonates with the viewer at the end when most people have left the theater.Watch our review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j95Zjdlcbe0",The Other Guys
33,Buddy-51,High-spirited and amusing buddy-cop romp,7,21 December 2011,"""The Other Guys"" starts off as just another cop-buddy movie but, about a third of the way in, it suddenly finds its mojo and turns into a clever, frequently hilarious send-up of not only police procedurals but the whole corporate and bank bailout outrages of the past several years.The mismatched big-city detectives are played by Will Ferrall and Mark Wahlberg, the former a forensic accountant named Allen Gamble who prefers crushing numbers at his desk to crushing criminals on the streets, and the latter, a stereotypically gung-ho, trigger-happy hothead named Terry Hoitz, who's been busted down to an office clerk for accidentally shooting Derek Jeter at the ballpark, and who's chomping at the bit to get back to doing what he does best. Together, Allen and Terry mount an investigation into a billionaire (Steve Coogan) who's become the target of a corporate client (Anne Heche) to whom he owes a great deal of money.""The Other Guys"" could easily have been just another big-budget throwaway filled with lame comic set-ups and even lamer jokes. Instead, screenwriters Chris Henchy and Adam McCay (who also directed the film) have come up with a manic mixture of goofiness and near-surrealism that they have refined into a tasty comic brew. Most of the dialogue is sharp and witty, and the situations stop just short of all-out theater-of-the-absurd.Much of the success of the film can be attributed to the wonderful performances by the two leads, whose decidedly different acting styles complement one another so completely. Wahlberg's deadpan, ""straight-man"" restraint provides a perfect foil for Ferrall's more over-the-top comic outrageousness, and part of the joy lies in watching these two old pros find their rhythm and go with it. There's also a goodly number of ""name"" players in the supporting cast, including Eva Mendes as Allen's ultra-supportive ""plain"" wife, Sheila; Michael Keaton as the police captain who moonlights as a manager at Bed Bath & Beyond; Rob Riggle and Damon Wayans, Jr. as a pair of hyperkinetic, shoot-first-and-ask-questions-later cops (their brief scene at an elementary school career day is itself worth the price of admission); and Dwayne Johnson and Samuel L. Jackson in cameo roles as a pair of super-charged, risk-taking detectives who take the phrase ""let's hit the pavement"" to a whole new, fatally literal level. And all are excellent.There's not much point in trying to look too deeply into ""The Other Guys.""

Okay, 3 out of 4 movies, but still. That's better than The Other Guys going 0 for 1.Pardon me, but this movie was just plain painful to watch. It was as if they had a bunch of one-liners and ""ideas"" for jokes, then started shooting the movie until about 75% of the film was completed and then thought: Oh, sh|t, we forgot to throw a plot in.Well, they looked like they were having a party – they certainly invited fifty of their closest Hollywood friends for cameos – too bad we weren't.I'll admit, some of the jokes worked and I smirked a few times, but for the most part, the jokes were forced and the so-called ""gags"" went on for far too long.

Damn, after fifteen minutes of that, move on!You'll know you're watching just slapstick and you'll know to leave your brain at the door when the movie opens with the most expensive gag in the disguise of a police chase in downtown NYC. Supercops Highsmith (Jackson) and Danson (Johnson) destroy everything in their path with little regard to property, rights or humans. Again, this is slapstick, so they're considered heroes.UNTILthey (not really a spoiler) perish and it's up to ""the other guys"" Gamble and Hoitz (Wahlberg), those wacky and goofy and excruciatingly unfunny odd-couple of cops, to take the lead. But, their chief (Keaton) doesn't have much faith in them. And they don't do much to prove their worth.Nowtake that concept of them acting all wacky and goofy and excruciatingly unfunny for about another hour (feels like three) and then get to what the movie's about: Redemption, I guess.

The same thing that's going on for, well, quite a while now.And if you're not up to date, make sure you stick around for the credits for a liberal message on the wrong-doings of the CEOs, Government, etc.Blah, blah. This movie made me miss Riggs and Murtaugh (Lethal Weapon) and Lee and Carter (Rush Hour) SOOOO badly. It wasn't the worst movie I've seen in this terrible year of 2010, but it certainly proved One Liners and Will Ferrell both need to stick to Saturday Night Live. At least those skits are over and done within about five minutes and not making us suffer about a hundred more on the same one note.",The Other Guys
35,cherold,breathlessly funny,8,16 May 2011,"I tend to have mixed feelings about Will Ferrell films. Ferrell is a likable guy and plays likable characters, but often his films feel a little too much like extended Saturday Night Live sketches; even if they're funny, they just don't have that much to them.But I love The Other Guys. The premise is unexceptional, a mismatched buddy movie about two undistinguished cops who stumble into a big case, but the movie is wildly funny.One of the things I love about this movie is how everyone plays it straight. Ferrell is almost as low key here as a cop-accountant as he was in Stranger Than Fiction, and while the movie is often extremely silly, no one in it ever gives a hint that they know it (although Ferrell has a few over-the-top moments that have that SNL cartoonish feel to them that I could have done without). Wahlberg doesn't act like he's making a cop movie parody, he acts like he's making a cop movie. There is a certain odd realism in moments where the heroes pull off something clever or dazzling and take a moment to be impressed with themselves.Mainly though, this movie is just really, really funny. I could not stop laughing.",The Other Guys

37,wellthatswhatithinkanyway,Misfiring comedy that never manages to rise above average,4,26 April 2011,"STAR RATING: ***** Saturday Night **** Friday Night *** Friday Morning ** Sunday Night * Monday Morning New York cops Gamble (Will Ferrell) and Hoitz (Mark Whalberg) have been pushed to the sidelines doing office bound duties, while other cops seemingly hog all the glory. While Gamble manages to keep a lid on his pent up frustration and settles into the mundanity of his life, Hoitz can barely wait to get out and get kicking some ass. But things look like they might be about to change for them, when an explosive new assignment comes up involving corporate espionage and multi national gangs.Just what we all needed, another light hearted satire of big budget Hollywood action flicks that thinks it can out shine the previous one before it. It's fitting that the lead character's name is Gamble, because that's exactly what the studios take when they churn out another one of these cookie cutter type flicks. And while The Other Guys isn't a completely dud bet, you can certainly think of better such films of recent times.With Ferrell in the lead role, it's safe to say he's the one mainly carrying the film and, always being a comedian who verges on the edge of annoying with me, here he comes dangerously close to the danger zone at times. Former rap star Whalberg has more presence in support as the tougher, more aggressive cop, but the main focus should be on laughs, and while there are one or two scenes that give the ribs a good tickle, it's generally a pretty bland, laugh free outing. It's not helped with the lack of a really coherent plot, which comes more noticeable more to the end of the film when there really seems to be a loss of any kind of narrative and it really seems to just drag on. There's some notable support from the likes of Michael Keaton and Steve Coogan, as well as cameos from people like Samuel L Jackson and Jamie Foxx, but, of course, it feels no less empty.For a film about men pushed to the sidelines, it's sadly fitting that in the long run that's probably the fate that will befit it just the same. **",The Other Guys
38,ElMaruecan82,"A Great Combination of Silliness and Intelligence, from the Team to the Plot",8,24 March 2016,"Since the buddy cop movie is a subgenre which, among many requirements, is not supposed to take itself seriously and offer a fair share of crazy action sequences, a spoof doesn't sound like the most original premise. How can you possibly make fun of something fun in the first place? Yet ""The Other Guys"" works, much to my surprise. While I was expecting a Laurel-and-Hardy-like pairing, you know with the straight man and the lovable buffoon, I was pleasantly surprised by the portrayals of the two cops, and the way their personality completed each other. Mark Wahlberg is Terry, a nervous trigger-happy cop whose career was compromised by the accidental shooting of baseball star Derek Jeter (looking like a suspicious guy with the bat under the shadow), and Will Ferrell is Allen, a passive and sweet office-bound accountant, who doesn't want to get in trouble. These guys form such a perfect pair of losers and loners they're inevitably labeled as the other guys.Now, who's the other's guys' ""other guys"", so to speak? Well, they make their entrance in one of the most over-the-top and brilliantly unbelievable chase scenes in recent history. It's noisy, nonsensical, each stunt asking more suspension of disbelief than a ""Matrix"" movie (actually, law of gravity is as disregarded as the penal law), and it features two bankable and believable legitimate movie tough guys through Samuel L. Jackson and Dwayne ""The Rock"" Johnson. They're the princes of the city, it's like Shaft and McClane under steroids with Starsky and Hutch's street smarts and brotherly love. What a loss when they met with the maker! But what an extraordinarily laugh-out-loud moment! I wish I didn't spoil anything but wasn't it obvious that they would have to leave room to the losers? And there's something so appealing in these guys, starting with their high self-esteem, they know they're only victim of unfortunate circumstances. Terry is actually a good cop and Allen displays a nice amount of wit and verbal come-backs, he also has an irresistible charm with hot women, which wouldn't make sense in a real world, but how about macho Terry who knows about music, dance and modern Art just because he wanted to make fun of some 'gay kid' of the neighborhood? In its own wicked way, the film manages to provide three-dimensional characters, that actually make us care for them. There's something so touching and vulnerable when Terry cries about being a ""peacock who dreams of flying"" and Allen's retelling of his past provides an interesting twist on his character.""The Other Guys"" have the characters, and the set-up ending with the previous cops' demise makes us expect a quality comedy movie. I think the good vibrations between Adam McKay and Will Ferrell not only worked, but Mark Wahlberg fits perfectly in this team as he never mocks his own character and plays him with the same respect and seriousness than his usual tough and no-nonsense characters. Ferrell is also remarkable as a guy whose comedic appeal doesn't rely on goofy attitudes or brash reactions, and when it happens a few times, the context makes it totally acceptable. Ferrell shows again his capability to play restrained and intelligent characters as he did in ""Stranger Than Fiction"" so the performance isn't much a revelation. Actually, the real revelation is in the story.Indeed ""The Other Guys"" has higher ambitions than the film it actually plays on, it doesn't just try to mock the usual cop archetypes, with the car chases, explosions, Mexican stand-offs, and evil masterminds, it actually has a statement to say about the way the economy works, and how liberal inequality is maintained by corrupt businessmen. A lot has been said about the film's ending credits, and without revealing everything, I must say it kind of killed all the fun, and made me realize that we were ruled by bad guys, basically. With all the Ponzi schemes (think of Madoff) the golden parachutes, and the wages difference between workers and CEO, you just applaud the guts of ""The Other Guys"" to tackle another kind of villain, than usual terrorists, kidnappers or serial killers.Still, for all the seriousness of the ending credits, McKay never tackles the story in a straight-forwardly serious way, you just have hints of what would become his Oscar-winning screenplay ""The Big Short"". The core of the movie still relies on the partnership between Allen and Terry, which creates some great interactions, involving metaphorical references (the Tuna vs. Lion speech is a quotable delight), an obligatory bad cop/good cop interrogation and many cute and sweet moments. They never express their mutual fondness but you can tell from their exchange that they respect and like each other, which is good, given the way they're belittled by their colleagues, except for their patient and magnanimous chief Captain Gene, played by Michael Keaton. And to complete the gallery, Eva Mendes is the too-sexy-to-be-true loving housewife and Steve Coogan as the corrupt businessman is a nice completion to the trio, during the third act.""The Other Guys"" varies from buddy-comedy to social commentary but the ensemble feels solid and well-structured, so that there's no moment whatsoever when we feel lost or that the story is going nowhere. Not all the gags are hilarious, but Adam McKay knows how to put his laugh-out-loud moments in the right places, and the performances of the two actors honor the plot. It's just a pity the film didn't get the success it deserves, but that's the risk with playing with archetypes that are already funny in the first place. I say a pity because this is a duo I would have loved to see again Such well-written and acted and directed characters as Terry and Allen deserved a sequel.In fact, even Jackson and Johnson's characters deserved a prequel.",The Other Guys
39,bowmanblue,A surprisingly funny film which isn't really a comedy,7,28 July 2014,"Sometimes a 'comedy' film boasts a whole host of A-list comedic actors and ends up not being particularly funny at all. Now, 'The Other Guys' may have veteran comedian Will Ferrell as top billing, but Mark Wahlberg is an unlikely partner for an out-and-out comedy film.But then The Other Guys isn't really a comedy. The humour is strange and not that obvious, let alone appreciated by all. I've seen plenty of reviews where people claim not to have laughed once. I, on the other hand, couldn't seem to stop laughing all the way through. However, like I say, this isn't really a comedy. It's only slightly less serious than the Lethal Weapon films. It's really a buddy-cop movie with shoot-outs, car chases and double-crossing that just so happens to be quite amusing as an off-shoot.Ferrell and Wahlberg play off each other well and the supporting stars all have their moments, too. It's hard to say what the target audience is, as the film encompasses so many genres. I guess it's a bit of a shot in the dark as to whether you'll enjoy it or not. But, if you're generally into Will Ferrell movies, or you're in the mood for an action/thriller/cop movie/comedy then give it a go.http://thewrongtreemoviereviews.blogspot.co.uk/",The Other Guys

Will Ferrell, is Allen, a police accountant happy with paper work and Mark Wahlburg, is Terry, known as the guy whom shot Jeter. The movie has got laughs but they sort of get more silly and less funny as the movie plods along.

I cracked up at the jokes many times especially the ones made by Johnson and Jackson. This movie is no Lethal Weapon but it's a good buddy cop movie nonetheless.This is about two cops who are in the office all day doing nothing but paperwork. Wahlberg's character decides that he wants action but his partner doesn't. Once the cops played by Jackson and Johnson dies, they may get their chances.The acting is awesome. Ferrell is funny in some parts. Wahlberg plays the tough boy he always is. Jackson still is the wisecracking dude even though he's up there in age. Michael Keaton is hilarious as the Captain.Some of the jokes were bland but the rest were funny. My favorite joke, even though I'm a big Yankees fan, was when Wahlberg shot Derek Jeter.

It's certainly a very fun movie, with plenty of laugh out loud moments throughout and it's a superb spoof on buddy cop movies, I think it will remind people of films such as Lethal Weapon or television series like Miami Vice, it is certainly inspired by these, but it has its own fun and original take on them. The only issue I really have is that I felt there wasn't enough action, normally crime comedies have a big action packed finale that's puts the characters in more danger than we've seen them in previously, this does happen here but it isn't as exciting as the build up for it was making it seem, and it certainly ended too quickly. The cast is outstanding, all well able to adapt to a comedy that was clearly high on improvisation, Will Ferrell and Mark Wahlberg play off each other very well and are certainly the highlight of the film, they clearly really enjoyed working together, and they also have a strong supporting cast from actors such as Steve Coogan, Eva Mendes and Michael Keaton. Very funny, memorable and well acted, I would recommend the Other Guys to anyone looking for a good comedy.

44,inkblot11,"Gugs and gals, this film deserves an A for its courage and imagination, even when half of the jokes fall flat",7,30 August 2010,"Allen (Will Ferrell) is an uptight accountant/police officer. He is not out on a beat but tracks criminals in the ""white collar"" arena. But, he does have a partner, Terry (Mark Wahlberg), a dimmer bulb who got a desk job when he ""accidentally"" shot Derek Jeter in the leg. Terry is not happy with his job or his personal life, for he can't get over his romance with a beautiful ballet dancer. The ""go-to"" guys on the force are two brawny daredevils (Samuel L. Jackson and Dwayne Johnson) who take big risks and usually get their perps. One fatal day, however, these two jump to their deaths and the Chief (Michael Keaton) decides to send out Allen and Terry. A mistake? We'll see. In the meantime, two corporate giants (Anne Heche and Steve Coogan) are trying to pull off a major swindle, raiding someone else's funds. Naturally, this is Allen's forte so he races to figure out how to stop it. But, Terry's problems and the two corporations' henchmen might throw the new dynamic duo off course. Will these two bumblers snag the big lawbreakers without losing their lives? This is a film with plenty of laughs, imagination and courage. Sometimes the results are hysterical, as when Allen plays the Little River Band on his car stereo, to Terry's chagrin, and the time a fellow officer relates the events at a local bar mitzvah. Now, that's entertainment. Other times, jokes fall flat, especially with situations involving Allen's wife, a totally wasted Eva Mendes. However, the cast of Ferrell, Wahlberg, Keaton, Coogan, Johnson, Jackson and all of the rest, comedy's best, definitely enhance the success of the script's elements. The setting in Manhattan is nice, although nothing spectacular, and the costumes, camera work, and direction have many fine qualities. Also quite wonderful are the stunts, with some truly topnotch car chases and explosions, if you are a fan of that sort of thing. All in all, its true that the movie is not an indisputable winner. But, it certainly will get most folks to laughing and its risk-taking attempts at comedy are absolutely admirable. So, guys and gals, go arrange a viewing in the near future.",The Other Guys

It's one of the those good popcorn fun, films. The Other Guys is one of the funniest buddy cop movies, I ever saw. Directed by Adam McKay, this action comedy really did work, because it lampoons and satire the Buddy Cop clichés to pieces. The Other Guys focus on two New York City police detectives Allen Gamble (Will Ferrell) and Terry Hoitz (Mark Wahlberg) whom been office pencil pushers for years. When the station's two tops cops P.K Highsmith (Samuel L. Jackson) & Chris Danson (Dwayne 'The Rock' Johnson), catastrophic met their end. The two are forced to step up and go after a giant corporate embezzlement case. I have to say, this is one of Will Ferrell's best roles. He wasn't annoying, or over the top. I think, when he's playing the character, with the deadpan straight-laced delivery. It's the best. Yes, he was bit abusive to his wife, (Eva Mendes), but it was play off as laughs. It was too disturbing, not to chuckle. I love how cool and collected, he was for the most part. I love the running gag about him, holding a wooden gun, and his misadventures with 'Dirty Mike and the boys'. Mark Walberg's character is bit bitter & whinny, but the character development, however, does help make him, likable by the end of the movie. Plus, most of his whinny complains were pretty funny. I love his lion eating tuna and peacock needing to fly, speech. Dwayne the Rock Johnson and Samuel L. Jackson's roles, while short was pretty damn entertaining. Steve Coogan is just as funny as the main cast as the supporting character, corrupt multi-billionaire David Ershon. He's so disarming and charming that he's hard not to like. I even like Bed, Baths and Beyond, Captain Mauch (Michael Keaton) who plays a mellow out Police Chief. I love Eva Mendes as Gamble's wife. She is stunning and beautiful. Wish, they had more of her in the film. I can do without Rob Riggie as Martin and Damon Wayans Jr as Fosse. They really don't bring anything to the table. The movie was less funny, when they were around. The movie has a lot of dumb jokes that was mostly a hit for me. Still, the movie was able to be smart enough to be taken serious. The whole Ponzi scheme plot was pretty interested. I like how the end credits are accompanied by with a series of visual displays of the magnitudes, methods, and principal actors of various licit and illicit financial doings of the financial crisis, such as the Bernie Madoff Ponzi scheme, Goldman Sachs, AIG or the Troubled Asset Relief Program. A lot of good information, that people need to know. There is an outtake between Will Ferrell and Mark Wahlberg at the restaurant plays after the end credits. Without spoiling it, the ending of the unrated version is just over the top though. The unrated version is just not as funny as the normal movie. Some of the movie was brilliant shot. I love the jump to the bushes scenes, and all the bullet time. Most of all, I love the drinking montage. What an unusual version. Instead, of than a time-compression montage, there's a fake continuous shot in which the camera weaves through the slow-mo antics going on over the course of the evening at the bar. It was pretty damn impressed. The action scenes were pretty cool to watch. I love all the shootouts and car chases. It was funny, when the store explore, and how the characters react to it. I didn't mind all the product placements in the film. After all, this movie did introduced me to the musical, 'Jersey Boys' which was awesome. Great use of establish songs, ranging from Foo Fighters 'My Hero"" to Black Eyes Peas 'Imma Be'. I also love the TLC references as a running gag. My favorite is Rage against the Machine in the end credits. I like all the celebs cameos in the film, ranging from Derek Jeter to Brooke Shields. Overall: This peacock sure can fly. It really was a good time film.You've seen the good guys and the bad guys, now go see 'The Other Guys'",The Other Guys
47,Floated2,pleasantly funny and it delivers!,8,2 September 2010,"The Other Guys is a great and funny action comedy starring Will Ferrell and Mark Wahlberg. In the film, the punch lines come fast and thick in the film's first half, detouring into some inspired out-of-left- field bits — a monologue about lions fighting tunas, hobo sex in a Prius — but as the film's convoluted white-collar crime plot takes over, the mirth wanes and what remains are mostly retreads of the movie's earlier jokes and lots of frantic action. Perpetually angry New York police officer Terry Hoitz (Mark Wahlberg) has been demoted to desk duty, partnered with Allen (Ferrell), a milquetoast forensic accountant. Their entire police division lives in the shadow of two supercops (Samuel L. Jackson and Dwayne ""The Rock"" Johnson), who are known for their over-the-top, property-destroying arrests. When the ultra-macho cops die in a hilariously surreal act of buddy-cop bravado, Terry and Allen get their chance to shine as detectives. Some funny comical notes and lightens are ones that include Allen's past life as a pimp named Gator, and Eva Mendes upending her typical throwaway hot girlfriend role into Ferrell's hilarious wife. Listening to her briefly croon ""Pimps Don't Cry"" makes clear that this is comedy by a thousand nicks. That was pretty funny the first time, after it went down. Another nice scene was the frozen still frame scene, showing a showing of Allen and Terry drinking in a club.Though the movie started off great with many funny jokes, the 2nd part of the film kinda went down from there. They added in too many subplots (Allen's conflict with his wife, Terry reuniting with his girlfriend, the crime bankrupt plot, etc.) ==================================================================== ======== As a rewatch (07/22/17') the Other Guys remains quite a funny film. The film was a success in the domestic box office (making $119 million) but it fell short in the foreign market (only $51 million). These numbers would be good for many comedies of today but this film, they over did with the stunts, shootouts, explosions, car crashes which lead to it having a $100 million budget. Rewatching it, we can see why the budget was so high but perhaps it was a mistake and they could have toned down a little on those stunts. The film is funny and the chemistry between Will Ferrell and Mark Wahlberg is great. The Other Guys, about 7 years later feels more so under-appreciated, and underrated as this is one of Will Ferrell's better roles and comedies.",The Other Guys
48,Movie_Muse_Reviews,Ferrell/McKay duo and buddy cop genre finds some chemistry,7,9 August 2010,"The buddy cop comedy sub-genre has been limping about Hollywood as if shot in the leg from an awry 9mm bullet. Now it's been found by the duo of Will Ferrell and Adam McKay, the pair behind ""Anchorman,"" ""Talladega Nights"" and ""Step Brothers,"" whose brand of contemporary idiot humor has been steadily met with compounding criticism the last few years. But the combination of these two seemingly stale styles works somehow in ""The Other Guys,"" even if it's not a total revitalization for either party.Ferrell's humor has led to the comedic veteran being liked or loathed in most peoples' opinions. Detective Allen Gamble borrows a bit more from the Ron Burgundy character profile that made Ferrell a household name in 2004 only much more modest. Both rely on the childlike innocence or unawareness that Ferrell handles best. Consider his most recent exploits, ""The Other Guys"" is refreshing. Pairing him with someone unpredictable in Mark Wahlberg was also a wise move. Wahlberg is the Type A of the twosome: angry, impulsive and bordering on wackjob. He operates on one level while Ferrell bounces up and down, occasionally going to his level and sometimes understating it nicely. It's a much more effective co-star than John C. Reilly, who offers too much of the same style as Ferrell, which in ""Talladega Nights"" and ""Step Brothers"" caused Ferrell to be the Type A guy.The two play detectives Gamble and Terry Hoitz, two NYPD desk jockeys who are, of course, totally mismatched. Gamble was promoted from accounting and Hoitz demoted from security. When Hoitz smells a big case surrounding a Bernie Madoff-like investor (Steve Coogan) that might put him back in the action where he feels he belongs, he forces the oblivious Gamble to step in with him.Fitted with even so much as jazz saxophone transition music, ""The Other Guys"" is a spoof at heart. Instead of the cheesy explosion that the pair survives in the nick of time, these guys get knocked off their feet and writhe on the ground in pain, with Ferrell shouting about blisters on his hands and the misleading nature of movie explosions. This additional ""objective"" of needing the film to serve as a spoof forces a bit more creativity out of McKay and Ferrell's writing. The usual improvised shenanigans wouldn't cut it here.The supporting cast in ""Other Guys"" is much more cameo-like than in past McKay/Ferrell movies. Rather than get wrapped up in giving other characters adequate screen time, the focus stays on Allen and Terry and their chemistry. Although it undercuts characters such as Eva Mendes as Allen's hot wife and Michael Keaton in a surprising but welcome comedic role as the police captain, it focuses the humor better and doesn't let it get to eye-rolling levels too often, at least as far as dumb characters are concerned.""The Other Guys"" definitely starts out stronger than it finishes. The biggest laughs are at the beginning and fade at the end as happens all too often in comedies that worry too much about resolving an uninteresting plot at the end of the film while also burning out recurring jokes (such as the Toyota Prius that Allen drives having a prominent place in the film).It's far from a Ferrell/McKay renaissance and it certainly won't leave you clamoring for more twists on the buddy cop comedy, but the two sides find a chemistry together that however brief, refreshes in a year light on good laughs.~Steven CVisit my site http://moviemusereviews.com",The Other Guys

This is, to all intents and purposes, a leg-puller for a movie much different from the one that we've just seen. For a film that means to show righteous indignation at present-day capitalism, it is made unmistakably clear in every scene how bloated and over-the-top the film's budget is. Sometimes these scenes are done very well, like when Coogan keeps distracting Ferrell and Wahlberg by giving them tickets to shows, we see them briefly at this huge star-studded events that must've cost a million or so to get in the movie, then back to them determinedly returning to Coogan's office frustrated that he keeps distracting them. The point of the movie is almost to include as many stars, mammoth stunt and special effects sequences and locations as possible in an hour and fifty minutes. This also causes the movie to languish through tons of scenes that do nothing to move anything along. You could shake this movie for a long time before every fatty minute has fallen out.Its plot does include a deceitful equity-fund manager, played by the dependable British comic actor Steve Coogan, and a Wall Street heartbreaker, but the plot is neither the movie's purpose nor its most remarkable element. Rather, McKay plays to his comic strong suits and those of his recurrent on-screen collaborator, Will Ferrell. Simply put, The Other Guys is most genuinely itself when it coddles in a spontaneous but still closely controlled absurdity that has the upshot of dispersing, instead of stimulating, whatever real-world resentment or aggravation you may have. Once again, and for the first time in a while, Ferrell uses his narrow body, his spry impulses and his markedly transposable voice to sponge incongruent and ludicrous qualities into an untouched but somehow immediately representative comic character.Allen Gamble, Ferrell's easygoing, desk-bound police detective, lacks the self-important onslaught of Ron Burgundy or the down-home belligerence of Ricky Bobby. Rather, he's assertively, brazenly, uncompromisingly submissive, an explosive namby-pamby. Gamble is shy, naive, inexplicably irresistible to Eva Mendes and yet unmindful of their attention. He makes no sense whatsoever, save for in the ridiculous framework of the movie's zaniest scenes. Gamble's antithesis is Terry Hoitz, an inauspicious detective played by Mark Wahlberg, who seems like an irate leghorn beside Ferrell's timid emu. Indeed, the two of them provide a more colorful, if less lucid, animal allegory in one of the film's funniest scenes, a semantic quarrel in which lions dispute tunas for animal kingdom domination.When it functions in this senseless sector of dialogue riffing and unsubtle clowning, the most virtuoso instance of which is a fight at a funeral carried out in polite whispers, The Other Guys offers some pretty big laughs. The Rock and Sam Jackson send up their stock personas and then skip out to let Ferrell and Wahlberg take care of business. Then Ferrell and Wahlberg are generous enough to surrender some opportunity to Michael Keaton, as the gristly precinct captain, and to Rob Riggle and Damon Wayans Jr., as Gamble and Hoitz's loathsome precinct competitors.It all pulsates along satisfactorily for about 45 minutes, with Mendes coming around for a teasing, good-humored turn as Gamble's wife, Wahlberg incredulous and Ferrell dismissing her charms. But The Other Guys tackles a genre merger that's basically a detracting commercial barricade. The Other Guys, despite the unfulfilled promise of the closing titles, beefs up potential that it has no actual penchant to meet.

He plays comedy really well, by playing serious, in the seriously, entertaining and different comedy romp, which has a beautiful, approved blend of humor and seriousness. They're are some absolutely hysteric moments here, as our wanna be serious, pen pushing cops, see an opportunity when two of their top collegues, bizarrely suicide. Facing constant taunts and humiliation, from two cops, our lovable buddy pair (Wahlberg and Ferrell, who work so comically well together) get out there, and make it happen, by solving the latest crime, involving your not so ordinary criminal. I felt Michael Keaton as their captain, was wasted here, but his presence was felt. You typically see the inter related stars, of comedy and hard action, cross paths here, and what The Other Guys has going for it, is that's a refreshing new comedy action movie, that should be high on people's radar. Eva Mendez as Ferrel's wife, has never looked hotter where poor soul Wahlberg, (a natural ballerina too) is querulous, to how he keeps getting the hotties.",The Other Guys
52,DarkVulcan29,"The Other Guys succeeds, where Cop Out failed.",9,9 August 2010,"Unlike Cop Out, The Other Guys never loses it's tone on what it's trying to be, an action buddy cop film parody, it avoids from being an annoying spoof like Disaster Movie(2008).Now I won't lie, after the insultingly bad Land of the Lost(2009), I had very low expectations for this film, or any film with Will Ferrell. I thought the film was gonna be just a one joke, and the characters where gonna be annoying, not annoyingly funny, just annoying.Thankfully I was wrong, this was the funniest film next to Dinner for Schmucks. I never thought an unlikely pairing of Will Ferrell and Mark Wahlberg could be so entertaining. Will Ferell is funny when he is not going over the top. Mark Wahlberg is for the most part spoofing his character from The Departed, and for the other part He and Ferrell just play off each other perfectly. Action scenes are pretty good. And Michael Keaton is funny as there Captain, and Eva Mendes bring some laughs as Ferrells wife.If your in the mood for a good comedy, and if you already seen Dinner for Schmucks, then give The Other Guys a look.",The Other Guys
53,freemantle_uk,Needed to be more edgy and risqué,6,20 September 2010,"There are many great actor-director combos, Scorsese and De Niro, Scorsese and Di Caprio, Greengrass and Damon, Wright and Penn, etc Adam McKay and Will Ferrell careers have been interlinked since Saturday Night Live. Under McKay's direction Ferrell has lived out a number of childhood fantasy, such as journalist, NASCAR driver and now a police officer.Detectives Danson (Dwayne Johnson) and High smith (Samuel L. Jackson) are hero cops in New York who cause a massive amount of property damage along the way. Allen Gamble (Ferrell) and Terry Hoitz (Mark Wahlberg) are officers who are forced to do there paperwork. Gamble enjoys the paperwork, but Hoitz longs to be in the heart of the action and in disgrace after shooting Derek Jeter in the knee. But when the hero cops die, the NYPD needs a replacement partnership and Gamble may have found the case involving investment banker Sir David Ershon (Steve Coogan).McKay and Ferrell both know that there films are not going to be awarding films but they know how to deliver a laugh. With The Other Guys they set out to parody (with love) buddy comedies, like Lethal Weapon, looking into the supporting cops of the officers who cause all the damage. There are some really funny moments and jokes, but this was when the film was more risqué and edgy involving sex (particularly involving homeless people), race and playing against police conventions, like when Ferrell talks a bloke into killing himself. But these moments are not frequent enough. McKay plays the humour too safely, what he should have done was been more edgy jokes, more willing to use language, violence, sex and race. The film should have gone for a 15/R rating, instead of playing it safe with the 12A/PG-13 rating.The action was decent, better then in some films, but of course McKay is a comedy director. The opening chase was deliciously over the top and a homage to the Lethal Weapon series. It was both funny and exciting. Other action sequence were well handled.If you are not a fan of Will Ferrell's over-the-top stupidity and physical performance then it is best that you avoid the film: but if you like it you will be happy. There are good moments of more understated humour like when he mentions how the Securities Exchange Commissions has failed with previous financial investigations. Walhberg's performance was strong as the straight, reacting to Ferrell's playing it by the book personality who avoids risks: he does humour with his anger and a moment I enjoy was when he threw Allen's gift out a car window. Being British is it enforced by death that you have to like Steve Coogan, and he was enjoyable, as well as supporting cast members like Eva Mendas. But Ferrell does play on what must be his personal fantasy, that hot women just fall in love with him.Also at times the film does divert into sub-plots and leads that go nowhere, none has enough of a comic payoff. The film was too long and should have been around 1 hour 40 minutes, a good length for a comedy.Jackson and Johnson were both very fun as the over-the-top, action packed cops and they deserve a spin-off.A decent effort, but try harder for next time. Hopefully the DVD will be more adult.",The Other Guys
54,dfranzen70,Wrenchingly unfunny,2,9 April 2011,"It must have sounded like a good premise at some point. There are the hero cops, and there are the other guys, the cops who do all the dirty, nonglamorous work. And this is their story. Wait, that's not a terribly good premise at all. Who cares about the other guys? What kind of an action movie would focus on the other guys? This one, which pairs accountant-like Will Ferrell with hotheaded Mark Wahlberg, each with an implausible past necessary to keep their characters out of the limelight and on light or otherwise boring duty. Each is envious of their precinct's hotshots, played by Dwayne Johnson and Samuel L. Jackson. But then the heroes are taken out of the equation, and it's up to the other guys to step up and solve some high-handed financial scheme.Ferrell and Wahlberg have no chemistry. They're just another set of mismatched cops with differing views on everything. Wahlberg pines for his ex, a ballerina; Ferrell is married to drop-dead-gorgeous Eva Mendes (whom he pretends is a Plain Jane, har har), and that's about the most plausible thing about the movie. One cop is straightlaced, the other is not. One cop drives a Prius, the otherwait, Wahlberg doesn't even own a car. So the only reason Ferrell drives a Prius is that it's easy to make fun of someone who drives one. Both cops are constantly berated and insulted by their coworkers for no discernible reason. They're not wacky, they're wacked.Is The Other Guys a comedy? Couldn't prove it by me. There's not a joke to be found, really; the paper-thin characterizations wear very, very quickly. It's as is the writers decided that Ferrell and Wahlberg would each be a particular type – but then found nothing funny to write about them. And let's face it, having one guy scream all the time and the other guy nerding up the joint doesn't automatically make things humorous. There are no gags, although you will gag at the ineptitude with which this movie was written (partly by Ferrell stalwart Adam McKay). There are no hilarious set pieces, no random bits of absurdity. It's a faceless, directionless pile of pablum that can't even muster up the energy to lampoon cop movies.The supporting cast is wasted. Johnson and Jackson are out of it early, conveniently enough, but even their scenes are one dimensional; they exist merely to show what Ferrell and Wahlberg aspire to be. (It should also be noted that the stunts in this movie strain credulity past the breaking point, with the lone exception of an early Johnson/Jackson scene.) It's as if the film were a movie about the making of cop movies, with all of the cops played by bottom-of-the-barrel stuntmen.Mendes is terrific and beautiful, and she actually gets some of the best lines in the film, as does Michael Keaton as the guys' boss, Gene Mauch – so named because Ferrell, in real life, is an Angels baseball fan, and Mauch was the name of their longtime manager. On the other hand, Rob Riggle and Damon Wayans, Jr. (oh, no, not another one) are as hilarious as constipation; they serve no purpose other than to be annoying, cruel, vapid, and stupid.It's saying something that the only real punch a movie provides is during its end credits. In this case, a series of increasingly alarming stats rolls across the scene, focusing on bailout money and bonuses paid to already-rich people who helped caused financial destruction in the United States. What that has to do with this movie is a connection that can be made only tenuously.",The Other Guys
55,meeza,My Others from another mother worked out except for the corporate undertones,8,8 August 2010,"There are many humanoids that think that Will Ferrell is the best funny thing since those other past funny guys that have caused many carcajadas (go to your Spanish dictionary) attacks to others guys & gals. And then there are the Anti-Ferrells, a ""stop the Will to power"" discriminatory group who crave for Mr. Ferrell to go to hell. There is hardly an existing middle ground with Ferrell, most people either love or despise him. And that is a matter of comedic digestive taste, but there is no denying that the man is multi-talented. He proves it yet once again on the funny, but a bit overrated, ""The Other Guys"". Ferrell joins up again with that other guy that he has collaborated in other side-splitting gems in the past such as ""Step Brothers"" and ""Talladega Nights""; that would be Writer-Director Adam McKay. ""The Other Guys"" teams Ferrell with Mark Wahlberg as two cops in a New York district police station who work in the shadow of a pair of heavy-testosterone super cops who pull in all the punches & bullets to catch the bad guys. Ferrell plays the bumbling former-accountant now police pencil-pusher Allen Gamble and Wahlberg makes his mark as the frustrated & enraged Terry Hoitz who is restricted from street crime police work due to the fact that he mistakenly shot NY Sports God Derek Jeter before a World Series game. So therefore that gives Gamble & Hoitz Associates their ""other guy"" police brand. When super cops P.K. Highsmith and Christopher Danson (played by Samuel L. Jackson & Dwayne Johnson) hit the red asphalt of cop super stardom in a high flying accident, Gamble & Hoitz and the rest of the other cops in the station want to hit the Po-Po Big Time by being the next Super Duo Cop Team. And that is where most of the fun lies in ""The Other Guys"". However, the plot line of Gamble & Hoitz taking on an investigation of a shady corporate David Ershon was too much of a not-so-funny scheme for my taste. And that is an aspect that I wish that McKay and fellow scriber Chris Henchy could have restrained from exploiting in a comedic movie; we are there as viewers in a comedy to unwind & disconnect from the disconcerting realities such as sleazy scumbags causing much of the country's economic woes. But to their credit, Henchy & McKay's screenplay did not need any scribe policing when it focused on the eccentricities & oddness of its main guys Hoitz and especially Gamble. And not to mention the whole subplots of Hoitz' coming-to-terms with Gamble having a voluptuous wife and Gamble's past alter ego in college were quite hysterical. As far as the Thespian Unit of ""The Other Guys"": Ferrell was yet again a comedic Will to honor with his work, and Michael Keaton went beyond his acting duties with his pitch-perfect supporting performance as the TLC-quoting Police Captain who also moonlights as a Bed Bath & Beyond manager. Wahlberg was adequate as Hoitz, but the over-the-top antics do not suit him well in a comedic performance. Eva Mendez was more of a physical figure as Gamble's hottie wife Sheila but she la la was more pleasing to the eye than the other gals in ""The Other Guys"". Damon Wayans Jr. and Rob Riggle did bring some laughs as bullying cops, but their performances were just about what was asked of them to do, and they did not bring enough to the charismatic table. You take away the corporate ""way to complex than it had to be"" storyline of the movie, you are talking about ""The Other Guys"" being another classic comedy. I much prefer the other comedic duo in ""Step Brothers"" which Ferrell was a part of, but there is nothing wrong in investigating if ""The Other Guys"" warrants a Mirarla Right. **** Good",The Other Guys
56,drqshadow-reviews,"Half Buddy Cop, Half Odd Couple",6,27 August 2020,"Will Ferrell and Mark Wahlberg serve as a pair of mismatched police detectives: half buddy cop, half odd couple. When the precinct's resident superstars (The Rock and Samuel L. Jackson, in a brief-but-hilarious partnership) meet a tragic fate, the resulting vacuum drives half the building to audition as their replacements. Everybody wants to be that guy on the front page, dressed to the nines with a noisy muscle car, suavely boasting of this week's big arrest. Despite his perennial desk-jockey status, Ferrell lets Wahlberg talk him into that sexy pursuit. And, as one might expect, soon they're in over their heads, up against some sort of loosely-defined international financial scheme.The plot doesn't hold up to scrutiny, but The Other Guys isn't really about the narrative, anyway. The whole idea is to let Ferrell bounce off walls and run with silly side gags, just like he did in his previous collaborations with director Adam McKay. As always, that loose approach allows for some funny unscripted material, but it also produces several stale bits that hang on for too long. It's probably safe to say the formula has slipped past the sell-by date after similarly rowdy, one-note concepts like Anchorman and Talladega Nights. Wahlberg isn't the world's best straight man, either, though he holds his own in the hyper-indulgent action scenes, and Michael Keaton picks up some of that comedic slack in a slim supporting role.As light entertainment goes, this is perfectly suitable (if extremely scattered) but it's neither as inventive nor as uproarious as McKay and Ferrell's best.",The Other Guys
57,st-shot,"Bad cop, mild cop.",6,7 September 2010,The Other Guys is a decent summer entry that falls somewhere between teen juvenile slapstick and wry sophisticated parody. Mind you it's neither but it does have an abundant amount of chuckles and director McKay keeps a lid on Will Ferrell's over the top antics most of the way with Donny Wahlberg offering a solid straight man.Gamble and Hoitz are a misfit team of cops with comically dark pasts. Far from the superstars of the precinct like the Rastas (played with full tilt bravado by The Rock and Sam Jackson) Gamble is a numbers cruncher and Wahlberg the perpetrator of a NYC sacrilege. When they stumble over a conspiracy to defraud millions from their own union they set out to redeem themselves.The Other Guys is a rapid fire presentation of humor and action that hits the target better than half the time. Director McKay is constantly going for laughs from the outset and he sacrifices subtlety at it's altar over the course of the film and the parody begins to dilute from this hard sell. He does keep Ferrell in check most of the way though and gets some excellent deadpan from Wahlberg and Michael Keaton as the chief to provide for what passes as decent comedy these days.,The Other Guys
58,alindsay-al,A poor Will Ferrell film,3,7 July 2014,"There are two types of Will Ferrell comedies the excellent ones like Step Brothers and the rubbish ones like The Other Guys. This film sees this team of Will Ferrell and Mark Wahlberg as a team of Cops wanting to make a difference and uncover a big plot. Now both Will Ferrell and Mark Wahlberg are both stupid characters in this film and they both just play there usual roles and they don't bring anything to the table that really makes the laughs. Also their chemistry is just off as Ferrell acts stupid and Wahlberg just shouts a lot and none of it is funny. Eva Mendes is annoying and stupid as Ferrell's wife and it just totally distracts from the whole film. Michael Keaton is pretty good as the Police Commander and he is the funniest character in the film. The best moments in the film is the first 15 mins involving Samuel L Jackson and The Rock. They're characters are awesome and it's great but for some stupid reason are only in the opening moments of the film which is insulting. Now the story is sometimes ignored in comedies but I still think it needs to be slightly interesting and this story is non coherent and stupid like this whole film. The script is okay especially for Keaton, Jackson and The Rock but falls flat for the major characters and really takes away from the comedy. The style is okay for what they were going for a totally unrealistic film that I must emphasise takes away from the film. Overall this is just a poor comedy that barely made me laugh.",The Other Guys
59,estebangonzalez10,"The Other Guys reminds us a lot of the other, younger Will Ferrell",7,8 September 2010,"¨ You have the right to remain silent... but I want to hear you scream! ¨ It was about time 2010 gave us a comedy that was actually funny. The Other Guys isn't a perfect comedy, but it does have several laugh out loud moments. This is one of Will Ferrell's best movies since Talladega Nights. It was good to see him team up with Mark Wahlberg in this buddy comedy and their chemistry was great. Most of the movie focused on them, leaving the supporting cast kind of flat, but it did pay off at the end. Eva Mendes, Samuel L. Jackson, Dwayne Johnson, Michael Keaton, and Steve Coogan had good supporting roles, but the main attractions are actually Ferrell and Wahlberg and the movie keeps us focused on them. Director Adam McKay knows Will Ferrell really well since they have worked together before in Anchorman, Talladega Nights, and Step Brothers. This is probably not as good as their two first movies together, but it is definitely an improvement over Step Brothers. McKay wrote the screenplay along with Chris Henchy who had also written a screenplay for Ferrell's other movie Land of the Lost. Ferrell is back to his old self mixing his calm behavior and nature from Ron Burgundy in Anchorman with some outbursts here and there. Wahlberg's comedic timing isn't the best, but he is funny nonetheless when he is screaming and insulting everyone. The movie could have been a lot better since the first half of the film is actually much funnier than the second, but it is still worth a watch considering there haven't been great comedies released this year so far.Allen Gamble (Will Ferrell) works as an accountant for the New York police department. He is very happy with his safe job and is always in the mood to do all the paperwork for the true heroes of the city: street officers P.K. Highsmith (Samuel L. Jackson) and Christopher Danson (Dwayne Johnson, better known as The Rock). Danson and Highsmith have just tore up half of New York City chasing a pair of criminals in a car pursuit. They catch the criminals who only happen to possess a quarter pound of cocaine, but are still received as heroes by city citizens because they are willing to do what it takes and even defy the laws of physics in order to catch criminals. Allen's office partner is Terry Hoitz (Mark Wahlberg), who is really unhappy with staying indoors all day and wants to be in the streets fighting real crime. The problem is that Terry has had a funny incident in the past (which I won't give away) and therefore he isn't allowed to work in the streets anymore. The police captain is Gene Mauch (Michael Keaton) who needs more men in the streets after he loses Danson and Highsmith. Hoitz forces his partner Gamble to accept a case in order to stop from being simply the other guys. Gamble isn't too happy about leaving his job because he doesn't like taking risks and he enjoys his happy life with his beautiful wife Dr. Sheila (Eva Mendes). Forced to take a call Gamble and Hoitz head to the streets where they accidentally run into David Ershon (Steve Coogan). Gamble has been building a case on Ershon because he believes him to be a shady capitalist, and now he and Hoitz have an opportunity of a lifetime to become heroes if they can uncover his fraud.The Other Guys may not end up being a very memorable comedy, but in a year with lack of good comedies, this was a fun and entertaining experience. Will Ferrell may have other funnier comedies as well, but it had been awhile since he had had one, and teaming up with Mark Wahlberg was a great idea. The chemistry between them worked really well and they made for a good couple in this buddy comedy. The beginning of the movie was pretty funny, Samuel L. Jackson and The Rock were hilarious during the opening scene and they also have a very memorable one when they are at the rooftop of a building chasing some criminals. I laughed really hard during these opening scenes. Will Ferrell was his usual self, without overacting this time and playing the nice guy. He does have a secret past which really works in this movie and makes up for the funniest scenes. He also happens to be a chic magnet which also brings several laughs throughout the film. Mark Wahlberg may not have the perfect comedic timing that Paul Rudd has for example, but he is still funny and makes for a good comedic partner. Eva Mendes also had some funny lines and we have seen her do comedy really well in the past as well (Stuck on You and Hitch). The action scenes in this movie are actually pretty well done and a lot of fun. The scene where Wahlberg fights off a bunch of guys on motorcycles is really well choreographed. I ended up enjoying this movie quite a bit, but I am still waiting for this year's The Hangover.http://estebueno10.blogspot.com/",The Other Guys

The back up cast is great here too; Michael Keaton and Eva Mendes as Ferrell's wife. The fact that Ferrell isn't aware that his wife is beautiful is cleverly done.

62,EUyeshima,Frenetic Buddy Cop Comedy Starts Strong But Peters Out in a Convoluted Storyline,7,6 February 2011,"Parts of this rambunctious 2010 buddy-cop action comedy are hilariously funny, but director Adam McKay (""Anchorman"") can't seem to keep up the momentum he sets up in the movie's first fifteen frenetic minutes. Perhaps due to Will Ferrell's presence, it starts to feel like a feature-length manifestation of one of his Funny or Die videos or at its worst, a padded skit from ""Saturday Night Live"". On the upside, pairing Ferrell with Mark Wahlberg as mismatched and thoroughly inept NYPD desk jockeys is inspired casting and provides several giddy moments, but the screenplay co-written by McKay and Chris Henchy fails to sustain its satirical edge throughout the course of the story.Ferrell plays mild-mannered Allen Gamble, who is perfectly content as a precinct pencil-pusher. He's partnered with Wahlberg's Terry Hoitz, a hot-headed screw-up desperate to get his old beat back. Terry lost his self-confidence as well as his gun when he inadvertently shot Derek Jeter before a Yankees game, a tactical error that has made him the subject of constant ridicule at the station. Both Allen and Terry idolize the superstar macho detectives (played with comic relish by Samuel L. Jackson and Dwayne ""The Rock"" Johnson) who have caused millions of dollars of damage in their relentless pursuit of the city's biggest crime rings. When their fate gets sealed in a most surreal stunt jump, Terry and Allen begin to piece together a convoluted white-collar conspiracy involving a billionaire's plan to cover the losses he has incurred for a multinational conglomerate.In the meantime, the reluctant partners get to know each other personally and discover some intriguing surprises, including Allen's hot, attentive physician wife Sheila. Whether spouting Zen-like psycho-babble or driving his tomato-red Toyota Prius, Ferrell is in typical deadpan form here except when reenacting his outrageous college years as a pimp. Wahlberg works best when he acts incredulous at his circumstances such as seeing a surprisingly funny Eva Mendes as Sheila helplessly smitten with Allen. It's also good to see Michael Keaton back in fine comic form as the precinct captain who moonlights at Bed, Bath & Beyond and cannot help but share his wisdom by quoting TLC lyrics.Steve Coogan manages a few funny moments as the targeted billionaire, as do Ron RIggle and Damon Wayans, Jr. as a competitive pair of bumbling partners. The 2011 DVD offers only three extras - a ten-minute making-of featurette (""Crash and Burn!: On the Set of The Other Guys"") which focuses mostly on the opening sequence; a four-minute short focused on unused scenes of Keaton at his retail job; and five deleted scenes. The Blu-Ray disc adds several more featurettes; a gag reel; an audio ""mom-mentary"" recorded by the mothers of Ferrell, McKay, and Henchy; the music video for the closing credits version of ""Pimps Don't Cry""; a Judd Apatow-like ""Line-o-rama""; and even more deleted and extended scenes.",The Other Guys
63,Enchorde,A comedy or a action that can't make up its mind...,6,21 March 2011,"The Other Guys is a little unusual movie. Starts out with a bang when detectives Danson and Highsmith go in a action filled high speed pursuit of some small time crooks. Danson and Highsmith are the heroes of the town, and when they get killed in their next case, they leave a big hole in the department. Detectives Hoitz and Gamble intend to fill that hole. Problem is that they don't know how. Gamble is a desk jockey and Hoitz always makes some critical error, still the laughing stock of the force since he shot Derek Jeter at the stadium.But since the adrenalin filled start the movie doesn't seem to know where to go. It got a good start, a good idea, and a good story to tell. But it doesn't seem to be able to make up its mind as to how. For a few minutes it's a comedy, then it turns into an action, then back to comedy, and so forth. It is never able to combine the two, it never get to be an action comedy. It got some good action, a few very good jokes, but most of the time it just feels a little off. It is nearly there, but misses its mark.It got a great cast as well, but Ferell and Wahlberg doesn't really work out as a pair. Part of that is intentional, but it makes the story stutter, it never gets into an flow.

Still, not being perfect doesn't make it not a fun ride.I will say, if this is something you're going to consider watching this, don't watch it on basic cable or anywhere that is going to censor it.

Writer/director Adam McKay milks the formula for as much comedic value as possible, and it is enough to sustain the viewer for a hundred minutes. It starts to fly off the handle (a bit) around the end, by going into action mode, but even here, the presence of comedy is evident. It kind of makes you wonder how Michael Bay would fare if he tried comedy. Scene one has a little too much Michael Bay in it. It's a sequence designed to make sure the audience is listening, It is a bit overdone, and is certainly the wrong type of sequence to put opening credits over. We are not sure which to watch, the film or the names of the people who made it. From there on, The Others Guys, runs nicely. Will Ferrell and Mark Wahlberg are a great mixed matched couple. Not only are their personalities different (mostly), but they could not be more physically dissimilar. It never occurred to me just how big Will Ferrell is (then again the last time I saw him was a few years ago, in Stranger than fiction)I got a kick out of this one.

68,SnakesOnAnAfricanPlain,The Other Guys (2010),9,26 December 2011,"I don't know if I can say enough good things about this film. It was exactly what I expected and much more. It hit the comedy nail on the head repeatedly, from witty oneliners, extended quotable dialogue, over the top slapstick, and some quirky character humor. Johnson and Jackson are two hotshot action hero cops that cause more damage than the crooks they apprehend. But this film isn't about them. It's about desk-cops Wahlberg and Ferrell. These two make a surprising comic duo. Wahlberg is the angry/disgraced cop looking to get back in the field, and Ferrell is more of a number cruncher. After investigating a scaffolding violation, they are dragged into an action scenario. The film kept me in stitches by variating on its humor throughout. There are a number of memorable scenes from the whisper fight to the accidental bribes. It knows when to finish a joke and most impressive of all, Ferrell moves away from the lovable idiot character. He sometimes misjudges a situation, but his character's competence is refreshing. Wahlberg is a perfect comedy performer. Best of all, we get to see Keaton back in a fairly large, comedic role. Well cast, well played, and I have a feeling it will have a high rewatchability factor.",The Other Guys

Also it's with the obvious combination, one hot headed foul mouthed tough guy, and one previously cooped up almost nerdy geeky pacifist. Unfortunately the story develops all too much like all those previous works. The action is not that good, even for an action comedy. This movie doesn't offer any new thing besides random shooting and car chases. The good part of this movie is actually all those nifty little jokes, especially the ones in the dialog. The action by Wahlberg and Ferrell is just about average, nothing special. For me Ferrell here is not quite the Ferrell we used to see, there is less of his signature hyperbolic manner of going into his character.

That makes for a decent character in one good movie. Some people - those with no taste - think that movie is Anchorman. I would forgive him for that abomination if that were the only movie Ferrell had ever made.Sadly, he keeps getting work in movies.And thus we get The Other Guys. So lame. So weak. So boring.SO. NOT. FUNNY.Oh, and as usual Michael Keaton is the best part of the movie, as he always was and always will be.I partly blame myself for even bothering to watch this mess. After all, the Bad Movie Indicator is right there in the cast list. No, not Will Patton. Nor Oliver Platt. But none other than Rob Riggle, a more recent contestant among actors vying to be the Ultimate Bad Movie Indicator. As in, if this guy's in the movie, this movie is terrible.

73,Matt_Layden,Meet the other guys.,7,15 September 2010,"This comedy film puts Will Ferrell back in the right direction. He still has some ways to go before becoming actually funny again, but with the help of his long time collaborator and new comer Marky Mark Wahlberg, we have a slightly funnier comedy than one would expect. The Other Guys is in the vein of Hot Fuzz, only with less jazz and more stupid Ferrell humour. It takes the buddy cop action film genre and parodies it. Sam 'The Man' Jackson & Dwayne ""The Rock"" Johnson are two egocentric big time cops who will do more than millions of dollars in damages to the city just to bust some people running dope. Tango & Cash on steroids. Their untimely exit (you knew it happened, come on) gives the others guys a chance to shine. The other guys are of course Ferrell and Wahlberg. Two polar opposites that when together make for some laughs. Wahlberg plays up on his bad boy rep as he berates Ferrell every chance he gets. This is a fish out of water style of film for Wahlberg who finally just seems to have found his footing in comedy. Specifically this style of comedy. Ferrell tones it down a notch, but does his typical long winded comedic bits at others. His backstory involving hoes and pimps was a huge misfire in my opinion. Eva Mendes is the sexy wife who gets nothing to do but be the good looking woman of the film. Her role is minute and her talents are kind of wasted, she does the best she can with the material. I really dug Michael Keaton as the Captain. With this film and Toy Story 3, I hope he has the comeback his so deserves. The comedy is really hit and miss. I expected it to be a lot worse. As far as McKay and Ferrell comedies go, it's pretty light. It's more grounded than their previous efforts and actually has a bit of plot to give the viewer. The Other Guys is a rental.",The Other Guys
74,lewiskendell,Mark Wahlberg and Will Ferrell team up for a pretty good cop comedy.,7,21 December 2010,"""We are going to have sex in your car! It will happen again!""Highsmith and Danson (Samuel L. Jackson and Dwayne Johnson) are the super-cops. The ones that always get the bad guy, can do no wrong, and basically turn any situation into an action movie (I'd love to see an actual cop flick starring those two). But when they're out of the picture and  (due to some pretty hilarious circumstances), it's time for the other guys to step up and investigate some massive financial crimes in the heart of NYC. Hoitz (Mark Wahlberg) is a disgraced and despised former hotshot cop (you shoot Derek Jeter and that tends to happen) who's paired with Gamble (Will Ferrell), a desk jockey who prefers pushing paperwork to busting perps. The chemistry between the two works pretty well, which is important, given that half the humor of this movie comes from those two yelling funny comments at each other. That leads to some funny dialogue, but it also makes this have a sort of haphazard feel, at time. Like some of the scenes have nothing to do with the overall story, they're just stuck in to show Ferrell and Wahlberg being wacky. That's not a huge complaint, but it did pop up fairly often. This is an action comedy, so it's important that both parts of that equation are at least decent. I have no complaints about the action half, as there are plenty of car chases and shoot-outs sprinkled liberally from beginning to end. And the comedy aspect is pretty good too, as long as you're a fan of the usual Ferrell/McKay brand of humor. Some of the jokes fall flat, but I thought the movie got funnier as it went along. There were some scenes that were flat-out hysterical, and some recurring jokes just kept getting better. Especially the flashbacks to Gamble's college alter-ego ""Gator"" and the way Eva Mendes' character is constantly referred to as plain and not very attractive.I wouldn't put The Other Guys ahead of Ferrell's best movies, like Anchorman and Talladega Nights, but I did enjoy it. The cast is really impressive, and it throws so many jokes at you, that at least some are bound to stick. You probably don't even need my review to decide if you'll like this.  If you think Will Ferrell is funny, check it out. If you can't stand him, The Other Guys won't change your mind.",The Other Guys
75,brando647,A Great Buddy-Cop Spoof; I Hope Kevin Smith Was Taking Notes,8,31 December 2010,"You know you're in for a good time from the very start, when director Adam McKay introduces us to the ""hero"" cops (Samuel L. Jackson and Dwayne ""the Rock"" Johnson) in the middle of an explosive car chase ending in $12 million in property damage. From the moment Jackson's car is launched from a bus into the lobby of Trump Tower and causes a massive explosion, we see McKay will be spoofing everything we've come to know about the buddy-cop crime movie. He will be doing so, not with Jackson and Johnson, but with ""the other guys"": Allen Gamble (Will Ferrell) and Terry Hoitz (Mark Wahlberg). The two are desk jockeys and objects of ridicule around the office, Gamble for his nerdy sensibilities and Hoitz for mistakenly shooting Derek Jeter and costing the city the World Series. These two will finally be given their chance to be ""real cops"" when they stumble upon a ponzi scheme where billionaire investor David Ershon (Steve Coogan) plans to embezzle funds from his investors to repay a significant debt to a major corporation.I have never been a big fan of Will Ferrell's movies. I enjoyed his run on ""Saturday Night Live"" but his movies have been hit-or-miss. With a few exceptions, I find most of Ferrell's movies miss. He does his best when teamed with writer/director Adam McKay (see ANCHORMAN or TALLADEGA NIGHTS) so I wanted to give this movie a chance, and I'm glad I did. Ferrell isn't his usual out-of-control annoyance, instead keeping himself subdued and only going wild when his dark college personality ""Gator"" starts to emerge. Most of the crazy behavior is left up to Walhberg as the short-tempered Hoitz, desperate to prove himself as an awesome cop. His outbursts towards Gamble are some of the funniest bits in the movie (especially the tuna/lion rant) and I was surprised to see that Wahlberg could do comedy as well as he does here. The two have an awesome chemistry and I hope Wahlberg continues to pop in to the occasional comedy with McKay now that we see he has the chops to do it.The supporting cast were just as fun. In addition to the aforementioned Jackson and Johnson cameos (seriously one of the best action spoofs I've seen), we've got Michael Keaton as the captain of the police force. Keaton is one of my favorite actors and he's a scene-stealer here. Steve Coogan's never failed to make me laugh, and the cops rivaling Hoitz and Gamble for the new tops positions, Martin (Rob Riggle) and Fosse (Damon Wayans Jr.), are funny enough that I wouldn't be surprised if they're given a spin-off (whether it be theatrical or DVD).While the majority of the film will keep the average person laughing, it's pacing feels way off. Despite it's reasonable run-time, it feels like it goes on a bit long and could've ended earlier. The gags begin to feel a bit stale as Hoitz and Gamble will apprehend Ershon and losing him. It gives plenty of opportunity for some great car chase sequences, but I think less would've been more in this instance. The subplots of Gamble and Hoitz's love interests probably could've been cut a bit shorter in interest of time, though they make for some hilarious moments. McKay's film continues his winning streak, and aside from a case of ""too much of a good thing"" making the end of the film run a little stale, this is one of the better comedies to arrive in 2010. I hope Kevin Smith was paying attention because this film is everything I'd hoped COP OUT was meant to be.",The Other Guys
76,sme_no_densetsu,"You've seen the good guys and the bad guys, now see 'The Other Guys'",8,5 January 2011,"""The Other Guys"" is an action-comedy starring Will Ferrell & Mark Wahlberg as a pair of mismatched New York City detectives. The strait-laced Ferrell & the disgraced Wahlberg initially don't get along but they manage to put aside their differences when they finally get the chance to tackle a high-profile investigation.The two leads, Ferrell & Wahlberg, turned out to be a much better team than I expected. Here, Ferrell is mostly subdued while creating humour through quirkiness rather than manic energy. Wahlberg mostly plays the straight man to Ferrell's antics but he occasionally shows a flair for comedy all his own. In support, Michael Keaton makes a welcome appearance and Eva Mendes ably holds her own with Ferrell & Wahlberg. Meanwhile, Samuel L. Jackson & Dwayne 'The Rock' Johnson are featured early on as a pair of stereotypical hero cops.In the director's chair, Adam McKay competently steers the film from comedy to action set-pieces. The script, co-written by McKay & Chris Henchy, sends up buddy cop movies with more verve than most films of this type. The plot, meanwhile, is decent enough but not especially compelling. The soundtrack deserves praise, though. Rage Against the Machine, the White Stripes and Foo Fighters rub elbows with unlikely suspects like Donovan, Phil Collins and the Mamas & the Papas.All in all, ""The Other Guys"" delivers comedically from beginning to end. I can see people not necessarily sharing the film's sense of humour but I was pleasantly surprised to find a comedy that didn't resort to recycling all of the same jokes all over again.",The Other Guys
77,Screen_Blitz,Will Ferrell and Mark Walhberg are insanely hilarious,8,18 August 2015,"Adam McKay, director of Anchorman (2004) and Step Brothers (2008), collaborates with Will Ferrell for the third time in this uproariously hilarious action comedy flick. Will Ferell and Mark Wahlberg play Allen and Terry, a pair of undervalued New York City cops who did almost nothing more than work at their office all day. After the highly cops Danson (played by Dwayne Johnson) and Highsmith (Samuel L. Jackson) are killed on the line of duty, Allen and Terry decide to take the opportunity to step in the game and crack their first case. Alongside this hilarious duo stars a like able cats of Steve Coogan, Rob Riggle, and Damon Wayans Jr.Will Ferrell and Mark Wahlberg starring opposite of each other may sound like an odd collaboration to many comedy fans. Surprisingly however, these two manage to pull it off and steal the show with near endless laughs and hilarity. These two made me laugh me countless times. Even after his previous works in Anchorman and Step Brothers, Adam McKay still manages to outdo himself with this guy-busting action comedy that never fails to bring on the laughter. The humor is often a mix of lowbrow one-liners and jokes dealing with police satire, with occasionally non-vulgar sex jokes here and there; and it always works. The characters know how to be funny without being overly vulgar and crude, which is good especially for those who do not bode well with raunchy R-rated sex humor. The action scenes here are pretty decent as well. They are never over-the-top or cheesy in any way, just good. Rob Riggle and Damon Wayans, who play fellow cops of the main characters, and Steve Coogan who plays the criminal are quite funny too.The Other Guys is very entertaining, very funny, and a blast to watch. This is probably one of the best action comedies I've seen in a long time, and one of the Will Ferrell's best movies. Please watch this!",The Other Guys
78,Troy_Campbell,A light hearted action-comedy.,6,11 September 2010,"Whalberg and Ferrell are a terrific team. Whalberg hasn't really ever done comedy before, with the exception of his wonderfully amusing turn in The Departed (which earned him a nod from Oscar). But like his performance in Scorsese's Best Picture winning crime saga, he rarely plays it for laughs as the highly-strung Hoitz – a couple of ""peacock"" moments aside – instead choosing to generate his humour as the straight, albeit tempestuous, character. After a string of less than impressive movies in the previous few years – The Happening, Max Payne, We Own the Night, The Lovely Bones – hopefully this return to form marks a comeback.In the other corner, Ferrell provides his usual big child routine, yet again producing hilarious results. His random verbal rants – the tuna fish monologue is outstanding – are delivered with an almost monosyllabic tone and very few facial expressions, making the matter-of-fact diatribes even more entertaining. The talented supporting players don't contribute as much as they should have. Keaton didn't resonate as the TLC-quoting Captain, Coogan is plain unfunny as the weaselling capitalist and the intentionally over-the-top portrayals by Jackson and Johnson as vainglorious cop partners didn't hit the funny bone as much as I was expecting.Director McKay keeps it simple. He allows his odd-couple stars to do the bulk of the work and minimises the rest. Of the very few directional flairs on show, a scene midway through presenting a big night out with a roaming camera and motionless images is amazingly effective and eye-boggling flashy. Elsewhere you have a satirical soundtrack that accentuates that parody-esquire tone of the film and a handful of cunningly written scenes that takes the Mickey out of Hollywood with a blithe glee.But this is the Whalberg-Ferrell show and their chemistry guarantees a light-hearted 107 minutes of action-comedy.3 out of 5 (1 - Rubbish, 2 - Ordinary, 3 - Good, 4 - Excellent, 5 - Classic)",The Other Guys
79,oneguyrambling,A good start runs out of gas early - an opportunity missed.,5,5 January 2011,"The Other Guys showed enough promise early that I thought it could have been so much better than it turned out to be. I blame Ferrell, The Other Guys could have been a minor classic if only they went for An Other Guy.Sam Jax and The Rock are Supercops, the kind that shoot first and get someone else to ask questions later. The kind that revel in the thrill of the chase: even if it causes millions of dollars in property damage in order for them to issue a parking ticket. The kind of guys that get all the hot sex and are invited to celebrity parties...You know - Movie cops. In short they are better than you...And everyone you know...In every way.Allen (Will Ferrell) and Terry (Marky-Mark Wahlberg) are not Supercops. They aren't even very good regular cops. They are the guys who fill in the paperwork and file the reports for the Supercops so they can get to the premiere on time. They are the guys who... no that's it. That's basically all they do, fill in forms. Allen is actually happy to do what he does and has no aspirations greater than staying behind his desk, Terry basically detests Allen for his contentment and yearns for a return to the field and ""real"" police work. I say ""return"" as he was once a beat cop until an unfortunate incident with a celebrity (it's a movie, it has to be a celebrity so the audience can go ""Oh my god it's really that guy"" and so the celeb can get an IMDb credit) saw him busted to a desk job.Michael Keaton is the boss of the unit, his job is largely to coddle the egos of the Supercops and make sure everyone else doesn't get delusions of grandeur and sticks to the form filling and coffee making.The early scenes are quite funny, Sam Jax and The Rock obviously have a blast overplaying their roles and hamming it up bad 80s buddy-cop movie style, the action sequences are fast and frenetic and occasionally inspired. I especially liked the wrecking ball scene. Mark Wahlberg is funny as the almost-straight man and Will Ferrell is mostly tolerable. I've read that Wahlberg's ""surprising comedic turn"" is refreshing and welcome. Hasn't anyone seen: I Heart Huckabees? An underwhelming film but he was the best thing in it. Three Kings? A great film that was funnier than given credit, and Wahlberg was himself very funny at times. Date Night? Again a lousy film but he was good in his brief scenes. The Happening? That was a comedy right? Right? RIGHT? Surely!Wahlberg might play the so-called straight guy but in doing so and actually acting a little bit he provides most of the best laughs in the film.Ferrell is allegedly the ""funny guy"", but he only has two personas, calm Ferrell and zany Ferrell. Calm-Ferrell is underplayed and always says ridiculous things - only in a deadpan and totally serious manner. Zany-Ferrell is the one who always gets his pants off regardless of the situation and yells every line especially when it would seem inappropriate to do so. Zany-Ferrell is also well known for his bizarre descriptions and wacky sayings and phrases; ""A whale's labia"" and such.I loathe Zany-Ferrell. So the fact that in this film he is Calm-Ferrell is a bonus, but Calm-Ferrell is equally annoying after a while. For example the biggest running joke in the film is that Allen's wife - played by Eva Mendes in full on ""Hot"" mode - is continually referred to as his ""ball and chain"", and put down as being ugly and plain. On the first meeting this is funny, as Terry gets to express his astonishment that dull old Allen has scored such a smokin' hot and friendly wife.The ""Old Ball & Chain"" - Seriously. That's what they call her in the film... often. The 37th time... not so much.Ferrell is allowed to indulge in his uber-serious and oblivious to all common sense sincerity way too many times, he has multiple patented speeches that ramble on into pointlessness and the less I think about his ""Gator"" pimp persona the less pills I have to take to stop the voices in my head from screaming.All that and I haven't spoken of the plot!The Supercops messed up. The Other Guys are unwittingly drawn into the investigation when they arrest a billionaire banker (Steve Coogan - Usually hilarious but wasted here) on a technicality.Despite all involved ordering them to stay out of the situation Allen and Terry follow up and uncover something much bigger and more sinister and must see there way to solving the case. Along the way of course they end up stepping into the Supercop's shoes and performing tasks and feats that would make 80s Arnie proud.Eva Mendes plays Ferrell's ""ugly"" wife... Wow now that I write that maybe it is hilarious? No, wait. It really isn't.The cold hard fact is that the first half of this film was very good, the second half proves a total let down. The jokes in the second half just seem lazy or recycled and revisited from the first 40 minutes. The frustrating thing is that overall there are some really good jokes and ideas in between the crap and Ferrell's self-indulgence.I think it's fair to place the blame for ""what might have been"" squarely at the feet of one Will Ferrell.Final Rating - 5.5 - 10. The fact that there have been precious few decent buddy cop comedies in recent years means that the promising elements here are all the more disappointing. An opportunity missed.",The Other Guys
80,bobsgrock,"Two cops, corporate fraud and the best Toyota Prius ever.",10,7 June 2011,"The Other Guys is Will Ferrell's best film since Anchorman and by far one of the best comedies in recent years. Many had thought Ferrell was going back to the same well too many times with recent efforts like Blades of Glory and Semi-Pro, which were lazy rip-offs of better Ferrell sports comedies like Talladega Nights. However, this is great material for him to work in and his long-time partner, writer/director Adam McKay, brilliantly exploits all the laughs as much as possible. Added to the mix is Mark Wahlberg, an actor better known for his serious, dramatic turns but is in fact one of the best comedic actors working today. His performance as the gun-toting, crazily ambitious Detective Terry Hoitz is genius in the way it combines fearless recklessness and sympathetic empathy. Wahlberg shows he has true talent in many genres; hopefully he will continue to make comedies in addition to dramas.As for the film itself, it works on every level imaginable. First, and most importantly, it is flat-out hilarious. For 107 minutes, there are dozens of laughs, mostly one-liners zinged by Ferrell, Wahlberg and the very underrated Michael Keaton as the TlC-influenced captain. However, there are also some wonderful sight gags, a few breathless car chases and a coherent subplot involving corporate fraud and conspiracy cover- up. Of course, the real plot is about these two opposite partners coming together. Ferrell and Wahlberg have such remarkable chemistry it's a wonder they haven't worked together before. Yet, now we know. Hopefully, this isn't the last we've seen of this duo nor this type of cop-spoof film. Laughs at every turn and a wise script that covers all its bases combined with a first-rate cast that includes Eva Mendes, The Rock and Samuel L. Jackson as supporting characters, there is very little to not like about The Other Guys.",The Other Guys
81,napierslogs,Not as funny as it should have been,4,29 October 2010,"""The Other Guys"" is one of those action comedies which have been so popular this year, except this one isn't very funny. I was looking forward to Will Ferrell and Mark Wahlberg in a comedy together. But Ferrell is better when there's intelligence to the writing and subtle comedy. Wahlberg is great as the straight man, as is Michael Keaton, but when both become ridiculous caricatures of themselves, the little bit of humour is lost completely.The action is over-the-top, the plot makes very little sense, and the jokes just aren't that funny. I would have almost nothing to recommend this movie, except there are some smart lines included. A handful of jokes that accurately depict society are smart and funny. But they are just too few and far between.Perhaps if you liked ""Knight and Day"" (2010) or like cop films, then you might like ""The Other Guys"". But mostly I was disappointed by it and found it not as funny as it should have been given its cast.",The Other Guys
82,TheUnknown837-1,"I freely admit I am not of the target audience that ""The Other Guys"" is aiming for. But I can only think of a handful of people I know (even Will Ferrell fans) who would be.",3,10 September 2010,"I think it is fair to all my readers to inform you, before you read on, that I am not of the target audience that ""The Other Guys"" starring Will Ferrell and Mark Wahlberg is going for. I like Mark Wahlberg as an actor and I like Will Ferrell as an actor and a comedian, but nevertheless, I am not the type of person who usually gets into slapstick cop-buddy comedies like this. There are exceptions, of course, but ""The Other Guys"" did not ring my bell.It didn't even begin to pull the cord.However, I must admit, that even though I know plenty of people who are Will Ferrell fans and who like movies such as this, I can only think of a handful who I sincerely believe would enjoy this picture. To my mind, it is a jumbled, unfunny, confused mess that fails to live up to the obligatory standards of its own category. As always, I entered the theater giving it the benefit of the doubt, but I left feeling thoroughly dissatisfied.I probably laughed only four or five times at this unfunny debacle, in which Wahlberg and Ferrell play mismatched but good-hearted New York cops who admire two legendary policemen (Dwayne Johnson and Samuel L. Jackson) but fail to live up to them. Then, one day in a highly inexplicable scene, Johnson and Jackson fall to their death off a high building, and they need to be replaced. Guess who fills their shoes? Guess who goes after the Ponzi scheme-esquire case that follows up next? You guessed it.With a better script, this could have been an efficient comedy. But with an underwritten, seemingly incomplete screenplay as it has, it is nothing more than a promise for a gag and then a fail over and over and over again. There are so many opportunities throughout its running time for it to deliver on a hilarious joke, but I can only recall even smiling a handful of times. The first character who made me laugh was not Ferrell or Wahlberg, who bored me, but Michael Keaton as their skittish and unhappy captain. And again, maybe this is because I am not a target audience member, but all those stupid gags about homosexual orgies, phallic jokes, lions eating tuna and vice versa, well...that just does not amuse me. And that Prius joke. You know, it was pretty funny when ventriloquist Jeff Dunham riffed on himself during his stand-ups with Walter, Achmed, or by himself. But here, it is so banal and tasteless and underwritten that it has absolutely no point.However, I think even to fans of this type of movie will be bitterly disappointed like me. This is why. Because the only real way a movie with standards as low as this could be funny was to follow through on obligatory moments, twists, and such and make the best of it all. But it does not. I usually applaud a movie for avoiding conventions, but this is one of the few times that I booed it because the choices that it makes instead are even more tiresome than the clichés. There is absolutely *no* bond between Ferrell and Wahlberg. All that happens is Walhberg screams at him a lot at first and less at the end. Moments where they might have a friendship moment are cut short in favor of more dopey jokes such as Wahlberg deciding out of the blue that he wants to be a traffic cop. That moment comes up suddenly and is dismissed just as quickly. There is no time to register any effect whatsoever on the audience, except boredom. Then there is that incredibly bad subplot about Ferrell's college backgrounds and just when we think that might actually start to serve some purpose in the plot, it is dismissed and wiped clean from the slate.It seems as if the screenwriter just wrote an outline, realized a full script was due the next day, and just added some dialogue under his notes. It feels that rushed.And another thing, if you're going to make a slapstick about a Ponzi scheme, why not treat that on a humorous note instead of trying to lecture the audience about it? That kind of story and monologue belongs in a movie like ""The International,"" not this.I laughed a couple of times, but not very often. Most of the time, I just sat in the theater with a sullen expression on my face. When I went and saw ""The Other Guys,"" there was only one other person in the theater. About five minutes after the movie started, he stood up, and quietly left the theater. He did not return.I envy him.And if it weren't for my ""critic code"" in which I feel I must see an entire movie before I can pass judgment (and the fact that I've seen comedies before that started dumb but got better) I would have surely left as well. Once again, I must remind you that I am not a particular fan of this genre, so I cannot promise who and who it will not appeal to. All I can do is describe what my reaction was and let you be your own judge. But for me, ""The Other Guys"" was sheer tedium.

Most of the better scenes were absent of Mr Ferrell. For me, the best parts of the movie was the ingenious opening sequence that created a fantastic satirical parody of every action movie filmed.The other laugh-out-loud scene was when Will Ferrell's character, Allen Gamble, introduces his partner, Terry Hoitz (played well by Mark Wahlberg) to his wife Dr Sheila Gamble (nicely acted by Eva Mendes). This is a well thought out and well written bit of comedy, shame Will Ferrell was in it, his over-acting very nearly spoiled the piece.If it wasn't for Dwayne ""The Rock"" Johnson, Samual L Jackson, and Mark Wahlberg this would not be as good a Will Ferrell vehicle as it isn't.If Mr Ferrell makes you laugh and puts a smile on your face then this movie is for you.

Sam Jackson and The Rock play cartoon characters, fun cartoon characters, but nevertheless they still very much belong on the pages of the funny pages. While every other character could easily be replaced by a Muppet, or a Looney tune without any change to the script at all. The movie is at times at least funny, but the laughs do really start to dip as the 30 min mark comes around as too much stuff is repeated or just isn't very good, and there's quite a bit of crazy action, but then again much of it is really badly shot with almost extreme shaky-cam that ruins the fun and doesn't fit in with the rest of the movie.

Jackson (Pulp Fiction, Unbreakable), and Dwayne Johnson (Scorpion King, Doom). What could go wrong? The answer. Everything.The Other Guys is about detectives Allen Gamble (Ferrell) and Terry Hoitz (Wahlberg) who are reluctant partners who can't seem to do anything write, leaving a wake of destruction behind them wherever they go. They are given the chance for redemption, however, when Allen stumbles upon a case that might be bigger than it seems. This is about as far as I can explain the story because from here it simply makes no sense. The Other Guys exemplifies my main issue with comedies these days. The jokes carry the story instead of the story carrying the jokes. There are so many moments in this movie that, albeit humorous, are utterly pointless and do nothing for the plot. Imagine this movie as a sheet of paper. Covering this sheet of paper are the jokes. And then there are little holes placed sporadically around this paper that represent the actual plot. The plot is suffocated by the so called humor of this movie that it makes it impossible to follow and just annoying to watch.Now normally I can respect a movie for at least delivering in its main selling point, the jokes. Even if the story lacks, if it makes my laugh out loud I still consider it a film worth watching. However, The Other Guys is just another stupid comedy that relies on silliness and sight gags. Most of the time I found myself shaking my head in disbelief at how stupid this movie was than actually laughing. No doubt it had its funny moments, but thinking back now I can really only remember the painfully idiotic parts of this worthless ""comedy."" Ferrell and Marky Mark do a decent job in their roles, but they simply have nothing good to work with. They deliver nothing new, and definitely nothing worth remembering.I am a fan of Adam McKay's. His directorial debut, Anchorman, is one of Will Ferrell's funniest roles, if not his funniest. Talledega Nights had some extremely memorable moments that I still quote to this day. And I just recently watched Step Brothers and had tears in my eyes from laughing so hard. But now I've learned that McKay needs to stick with what he does best, straight comedies. The Other Guys is a buddy cop movie, so obviously it has its fair share of action sequences. Each one of these is so poorly directed that I sometimes found myself cringing. Adam McKay cannot do action, but I'll stick with him as long as he goes back to what he's good at.The Other Guys has reminded me what it truly feels like to be disappointed by a comedy. At least most comedies of the same nature as this one can be enjoyed and are good for a few laughs. This one was American comedy at its low. Skip this movie. There's nothing worth remember here.",The Other Guys
87,carbuff,"Often laugh-out loud funny, but uneven and about 15 minutes too long",6,9 March 2020,"First off, generally speaking, I can't stand either Ferrell or Wahlberg, but then, every now and then, I like one of their movies. This is one of those.Second, another reviewer mentioned that there's a ""family friendly"" version of this movie out there somewhere. If you were to take out the crudity, bad language, and sexual and toilet humor, you would also take out every laugh. Make sure you're watching the right version.Third, if you don't get the pop-culture references that litter this parody/spoof, then you probably won't enjoy this movie at all. Many older people will only find it an offensive and pointless waste of their time. Guaranteed.Finally, on the other hand, if you get this movie and what it's referencing, it's frequently laugh-out loud funny. It's glaring problem is that it badly needed skilled editing. It was too long and the plot often stopped flowing well. This is really a shame, because the basic concept of mocking buddy-cop flicks is so solid; however, it feels like everyone involved was a bit too lazy to really make this production shine. It was obviously a paycheck movie. Still, I got enough of a kick out of it to recommend it to a certain limited audience. If it sounds like that might include you, you might want to give it a try.",The Other Guys

90,deatman9,Quite humorous.,6,22 November 2012,I never really wanted to see this movie all that bad but it was on T.V the other night so I decided hey what the hell and gave it a watch. It did have its funny moments no surprise starring Will Ferrell and Mark Wahlberg who actually make a pretty good duo together. Ferrell obviously being the more experienced comedian really stole the show and made it good. The story line was kind of unoriginal and it had a huge budget I cant possibly see how they spent it.This movie is about two cops who are desperate to become the new hero cops after the last two hero cops jumped off a building thinking a little patch of bushes would save them. They take on a new case and try to figure it out and make a name for themselves.This movie was pretty good but it was nothing special. It definitely had its moments and is worth a watch or two just nothing you will be talking about for days to come after watching.,The Other Guys
91,ofpsmith,A funny cop movie.,9,30 January 2016,"The comedy in The Other Guys, comes from the relationship between partners, Detective Allen Gamble (Will Ferrell) and Detective Terry Hoitz (Mark Wahlberg), two desk cops that idolize NYPD heroes Christopher Danson (Dwayne Johnson) and PK Highsmith (Samuel L Jackson). The only problem is that Terry can't stand Allen and his insistence to do menial work. However they learn to get along in order to investigate wealthy businessman David Ershon (Steve Coogan). The movie is a scenario with a bunch of jokes, like a lot of great comedies. Ferrell and Wahlberg are great together, and a lot of the comedy is derived from them. Eventually Ershon gets a lot of laughs when Allen and Terry kidnap him. The bottom line is the movie is really funny. I highly recommend, The Other Guys.",The Other Guys
92,Christian_Dimartino,Farrell's funniest since Anchorman?,9,9 August 2010,"Will Ferrell and Mark Whalberg are The Other guys. The Other guys is Will Ferrell's funniest and most fun film since Anchorman,which was his masterpiece. THere is a lot to admire here. The film is similar to Cop out, only funny.In the police force, there are cops who get into car chases and shoot down bad guys. The real deal. Then,there are The other guys(Ferrell and Whalberg). Allen(Ferrell) is a goofy cop who doesn't really care about his job.But Terry(Whalberg) is quite the opposite. He really cares about his job. This is part of the reason why they don't get along.So, after the real deal cops die, they decide to try and take their place. The cast also includes Samuel L. Jackson and The Rock as the better cops, Eva Mendes as Allen's wife,who he seems to not care about, Michael Keaton as the chief, Steve Coogan as the guy they're after, and more.I had a blast with The Other guys. It's the first Will Ferrell comedy in years that could become a classic. Anchorman was an instant classic. This is his best comedy since Anchorman. That's my opinion.The film goes in the tradition of films like Rush hour and Lethal weapon. But it goes a little further than the level of Rush hour. Cause here both actors are very likable. Unlike Rush hour,which I only payed attention to do to Chris Tucker.I appreciated Mark Whalberg's role in this film. After seeing him in a film like The Departed where he plays such a serious cop, here he plays such a serious cop but in comedy form. I enjoyed The Other guys. It's hilarious,fun and exciting.Originality?I don't know. But you forget about that. Enjoy yourself.3.5/4",The Other Guys
93,qormi,"If you show up for the game, you have to play all four quarters.",7,4 October 2012,"This movie had some hilarious moments. Farrell and Wahlberg have great chemistry and I would like to see a sequel to this film. Very original comedy - Johnson and Jackson as super cops was like a movie-within-a movie. The action sequences involving them were the best I've ever seen. I'd like to see them in a buddy movie with their '71 Chevelle. Some moments were too funny - like the offhanded comment when Jackson tells Farrell to shut up or he'll... (do something with his hand). The thing about Farrell's pimping past and his hot wife was hilarious. The part where Farrell's ex-girlfriend and her loony husband..Wahlberg's neurotic machismo....throwing Farrell's gift out the window...That said, the movie had some drawbacks - the villain, a Bernie Madoff type, was too vague and uninteresting - he seemed like a nice guy, which didn't work well; not well-developed.The entire movie petered out toward the end. As in a football analogy, the fist three quarters were terrific; the fourth quarter was filled with confusing action sequences and fell flat.",The Other Guys
94,Maniac-9,Hilarious buddy cop movie,8,10 February 2012,"Kevin Smith should take notes here this is how a good buddy cop comedy movie should go, not his terrible Cop Out which lets be honest sucked.Mark Wahlberg and Will Ferrell play off of each other so well and Eva Mendes did a great job as Ferrell's wife. The punchlines are delivered perfectly and if you don't laugh out loud then I seriously don't think you'll laugh at anything. A lot of times every good funny line they have is stuffed into the commercial, in this movie that's just the tip of the iceberg.Also Michael Keaton is hilarious as their captain.Samuel L. Jackson and Dwayne Johnson play the roles of the two bad ass cops that everyone looks up to, but due to unforeseen actions they bite the bullet. So Wahlberg and Ferrell's cop characters who aren't as well received decide to pick up the slack.",The Other Guys

I just wanted the final credits to roll - which I found to be far more entertaining then the movie itself.Glad I didn't pay for this, because I found this to be a horrible mess - especially the end.Out of the two comedies I saw that day, ""Easy A"" and ""The Other Guys"", Easy A - is by far a superior film with a solid story and humour and this is just a bunch of rehashed stores pieced together with an over abundance of gunfire where there should have been none.I was disappointed after seeing a movie which I absolutely wanted to view.Another letdown from Will Ferrel and cast.",The Other Guys
96,nicholls_les,Just not funny,1,31 May 2016,"Sorry all those who loved this but I didn't laugh or even smile once. A comedy is only a comedy if it is funny and Will Ferrel doing a poor impression of Chevy Chase just doesn't do it for me. The Mark Walberg character was weird and I never got what his angle actually was, in fact that was true of most of the characters, they were a mish-mash of characters from other comedy films and it just didn't work. But I guess the fault lies in the script and direction because as I said it just wasn't funny. Now I am sure many who did like it may have rolled about laughing but maybe that just shows we all have different tastes when it comes to humour. On a side note I was quite shocked at how short both Mark Wahlberg and Michael Keaton were. I kept thinking 'how on earth did that guy play Batman?",The Other Guys

Strange...Well i was enjoying the movie great until it spend a solid 20-30 minutes talking about all these super hot women just all over Ferrel.

98,christophe92300,Average,5,4 December 2012,"The Other Guys scores an average grade like most of the Adam McKay-Will Ferrell collaborations. This one starts a bit slower than usual, the time to establish our quirky pair of cops. The plot is rather enjoyable to follow even though, of course, it is very classic and consensual. It unfolds a bit roughly, due to a rhythm issue, which is often the case in McKay's filmography.As for the humour, the gags are, like always, quite uneven: some are very good, some fall flat, but the absurdity characterizing McKay & Ferrell is still noticeable. The latter is in a great shape, whereas Wahlberg struggled throughout the movie with this unusual comic role.",The Other Guys

101,willcundallreview,A funny comedy that has Ferrell on form,7,26 May 2014,"Rating-7/10The Other Guys is a comedy that boats not just funny stunts and dialogue, but also a very good action performance for a comedy role. Mixing slightly crude jokes well enough so it isn't too bad, and then adding into the mix smartly thought out jokes, this movie turns out very fun. Adam McKay yet again is back to his best making comedies, whether or not this is his very best work, well that is not my decision to make although I felt this was strongly a pretty good film.The story about cops in a comedy seems a bit Cliché but it honestly works out in the end to be funny, takes just a little time getting started and not ""all"" jokes work but still gives good laughs. The story is actually quite fun, go along with the plot and enjoy the jokes and you will hugely enjoy this, it doesn't contain all the action I expected from the posters but still has some, when it used it usually very funny, I will add though, the jokes are never quite crying but there a lot of chuckles nevertheless, good fun.Will Ferrell and Mark Wahlberg put in a funny performance here, acted funny yes, Ferrell at his best, well maybe not but even so when it comes to where it matters he really knows how to do comedy. Wahlberg goes along well to say he isn't the comedy specialist and if you didn't know he usually does serious films, you would possibly think he is a comedy actor, good work. No one else makes a serious attempt to out do the main two guys but a bit more of Samuel L Jackson could have made this just a little better, maybe just a little little.It is written well with McKay doing directing and writing duties here, he seems to control Ferrell with a different way from say Anchorman, he lets Ferrell go a bit more control freak but stupid yet not turn into Ron Burgundy, good job from him. I appreciated the dialogue a bit but a lot of the comedy comes from it's physical aspect, so occasionally the talking gets a little shaky(immature to be fair), but it works out all well.Of any criticisms come to this, it is the missed jokes, not always funny and that is why it really isn't a great film, close to good but as I say not great. You could say the film also as previously said lacks the action that might seem a given with this film, it isn't completely without action but we should get to see just a little more. I felt Whalberg doesn't always deliver his comedic performance always well although of course he isn't used to it and this is new territory.Ferrell fans won't be disappointed at all, they should hugely enjoy this and it may just rank among your favourites, again if anyone particularly likes McKay films then you will also like this, his marks are all over this one. For those less inclined to these two guys above, it is fun anyway and you should get some laughs out of it, if you consider yourself very highbrow when it comes to comedy, you may not enjoy it so much but just take a little chill pill with this and you should enjoy.Overall I give this a 7/10, it is in my opinion Strongly Kind of Good, goes far away from just being OK as well, a good job and possibly unexpected. Watch it and enjoy, it has plenty of funny lines and parts, a story like I said, is good to go along on with and really tries hard to get fans, unlike so others that seem lazy and overused. One more thing to say is that if you watch this and you enjoy Ferrell's type of comedy, it will make you cry, different maybe to how he is in some of his other comedies although still has that funny serious look even when he is stupid.",The Other Guys

I watched this movie in the cinema in 2010 when it came out, it was a good movie to catch.The story is very intriguing to the point it keeps you interested in whats going on, I like movies like this, the ones where they can keep you entertained the whole way through. If you are feeling like you need a new cop out movie then this is a good place to start. Not your typical cop movie as these aren't just any cops, you've got the front line cops who get all the attention, all the fame and all the paparazzi and... you got the other guys.Will Ferrell & Mark Wahlberg are a duo i didnt think I needed until it happened, they are two of my favourite comedic actors, never failing to keep me amused.I highly recommend this movie to fans of both and all the actors involved, there are some great names in the mix, stick it on and you'll see.",The Other Guys

105,diac228,"Everything you expect from Ferrell, except with much more",8,6 August 2010,"Just when you think you've seen one Will Ferrell movie, you've seen them all, think again. Try this on for size: Usual Ferrell comedy plus crazy action plus subtle political and economical commentary plus excellent soundtrack. The Other Guys is a surprisingly hilarious and surprisingly action-packed movie that will keep you entertained throughout without actually dumbing you down. Unlike most Will Ferrell movies, you don't have to shut off your brain in this one; you actually have to pay attention because aside from the comedy, there is a complex crime to solve. Adam McKay delivers his best writing and directing performance, while the excellent cast ranging from Ferrell to Wahlberg to Keaton provides plenty of laughs, plenty of one-liners, and plenty of entertaining moments that propel this movie past the slowest of scenes.The Other Guys is about two mismatched behind-the-scenes paper-pushers (Will Ferrell and Mark Wahlberg) quietly investigating a series of suspicious events stemming from a unique bank robbery. Along the way they try to defeat their personal demons and try to figure out how to get along with each other. Unlike most Ferrell movies, in which it's a simple concept and improv provides the filler material, this movie actually has a mildly complex and heavy script, but still gives the cast a chance for a little improvisation. Written by the director and also Chris Henchy, I'll even go as far as to say that this among the best comedic scripts since last year's The Hangover. To add to that, McKay and Henchy pull a neat trick by slowly feeding you some commentary about big business and its mannerisms. The last mainstream comedy to attempt this was the mildly underrated Fun with Dick and Jane remake with Jim Carrey.While this movie does not have the extensive magical gathering of comedians like Anchorman (then again, what movie does?), the cast still does an excellent job bringing the comedy from the script to the screen. Will Ferrell is a little more toned-down this time, but still has his usual moments (screaming like a girl, random quotes, random singing, quirky one-liners). Mark Wahlberg however, steals the show with his angry lines, his bitter delivery, and his outbursts. The only thing hindering Wahlberg is the PG-13 rating; who knows what more classic lines he could have pulled off if he was allowed to go uncut (Remember him in The Departed?). Smaller roles fill the bill in the laughs department, including Eva Mendez (beautiful as always), Michael Keaton, Steve Coogan, Samuel L. Jackson, Dwayne Johnson, and the cameos.Even though Farrell has been hit-and-miss with the public and the critics, his best work always has been with Adam McKay. Anchorman, Talladega Nights, and Step Brothers were their previous collaborations and those three clearly top anything else Farrell has pulled off. The Other Guys in terms of directing and pacing dethrones them all. McKay does more than just handle the camera and let the actors mouth off; he stages some great action sequences and does a fantastic job directing a slow-motion bar sequence that displays the coolest slo-mo effects since Zombieland. The first half was so overloaded with funny scenarios, the audience very often was laughing so hard they missed the next couple of jokes while trying to recover from the last two. One scene in particular had the audience nearly drown out the sound of the audio coming from the movie.The first half was absolutely spectacular and downright comical; the second half never had a chance to duplicate the magic of the first hour. This is where Adam Mckay's biggest issues have been: in the final third of the flicks. All of McKay's movies lose steam and slow down towards the end, preventing them from becoming eternal comedic classics. In the case of The Other Guys, he improved a bit by still providing some of the laughs, even though you will still feel the momentum slowly die down. The cop clichés, while not taken seriously, still mildly hindered the moments leading up to the climax. There were some unnecessary scenes; a little bit of editing could have really helped this movie. But, unlike the other movies, the third act stays afloat thanks to the Wahlberg/Ferrell mix, as well as the continuing mystery that was slowly unfolding. Then stay tuned for the credits, when the commentary rushes at you full-force.Bottom Line: Honestly, I never thought that Will Ferrell would be involved with Mark Wahlberg, a creative script, hidden commentary (that unveils itself when you least expect it), and a soundtrack consisting of Rage against the Machine. Nonetheless, the combination worked like a great mixed drink that has you asking for seconds and thirds. The one-liners are flying all over the place, and so are the bullets. The Other Guys is the funniest movie of the year so far, and clearly the best surprise we've had this summer. Adam McKay continues to claim the throne as the best comedic director in the business, and this movie is more evidence. All McKay needs to do is cut back on the overall running time. This is the first Will Ferrell movie that you must pay close attention to (in terms of visual humor and crime-solving), and is overall one of his best movies.",The Other Guys

Now, this Mckay-Ferrell group has brought us, ""The Other Guys"". The movie is a satire buddy cop feature that talks about being the hotshots, and being the next to take the dream of a lifetime. And the comedy duo of Will Ferrell and Mark Wahlberg, they both create a unique and hilarious chemistry together, and they are a perfect duo. The rest of the cast including Eva Mendes, Michael Keaton, Samuel L. Jackson, and Dwayne Johnson was also hilarious, and took on newer and challenging roles. And also, it's another well-written comedy that only Adam McKay and Will Ferrell can bring. Also, the laughs are deserving, and I laughed really hard until my heart stopped beating, and it's been like that every single moment of the film. And let's not forget that the action was sweet and electrifying, and when you're watching action in a comedy like this, you're not going to regret watching this movie. The script is hilarious, the action is top-notch, the cast is crazy funny, and every single moment made you feel like you are in the experience as a real cop.

110,dvc5159,An action spoof that hits most of its targets (if not all). Ferrell and Wahlberg are hilarious,7,15 October 2010,"Will Ferrell is back since the disappointing ""Land of the Lost""! Who knew Mark Wahlberg could be genuinely hilarious? ""The Other Guys"" is the latest comedy to poke fun at the buddy cop genre, but this one is one of the best because the actors and director knew what they were doing.Ferrell and Wahlberg have terrific chemistry and both of them have perfect comedic timing. But let's not forget the other supporting actors (too many to list here), as all of them have some memorable and quotable lines.The jokes weave through slapstick and crude territory, while not being overly vulgar and overdone. The story is actually pretty engaging, as it is a genuine cop mystery at its core, but it is used as a vehicle for all the jokes to come in. And the jokes kept coming and had the entire audience laughing as well, this one the loudest compared to the previous Steve Carell entries ""Date Night"" and ""Dinner For Schmucks"". Sorry Steve, this year Will and Mark stole the audience.Having said that, the production design, cinematography, editing, stunts/special effects are good, and the direction by Adam McKay is lighthearted and brisk. McKay is seriously becoming a big name in comedy film directors, and here is another memorable feather in his cap.Overall, if you are in need of a laugh, see this movie A.S.A.P.

Jackson and Dwayne Johnson had screen time, after the point where they are no longer in it the film goes downhill fast.The acting is a different kind of screw up altogether, I don't know who told Will Ferrel he was funny perhaps it was his parents or his girlfriend or is boyfriend but this guy is about as far from a comedian as it gets, the only thing that's funny about him is that he has a face that screams ""punch me!!"" the other thing about Ferrel that would be a guaranteed riot would be if he announced that he was going to take up serious acting.Each and every character in this film is a total idiot and if you listen to the way they talk you'd swear you were watching your day care center days unfold before your very eyes and the sleazy sex talk between Will Ferrel and Eva Mendes, I never imagined that couples really talked like that to each other, for example Ferrel says to Mendes ""I'm gonna do you grandpa style.""

It is then Allen & Terry must jump into action when they have to take down a rich businessman (Steve Coogan) who is illegally paying a number of people back money. Ferrell & Wahlberg play well off each other, and although Ferrell has done better works in films like Anchorman & Talladega Nights, he certainly hasn't had the chemistry with anyone such as in this film. A constant joke is that Ferrell is a nerdy, vastly unappreciative guy who seems to still get a lot of hot women, and that joke was funny every time. There are a lot of constant jokes that are actually funny every time. Although is does drag a bit toward the end and it becomes a typical action film for the last 15 minutes, it delivers because up until the hour and a half point, it had me rolling in the aisles with laughter, and for that I am highly recommending The Other Guys.",The Other Guys
114,jb_campo,About what you expected,5,12 March 2016,"I wanted to laugh, so I tried the Other Guys. It's a typical Will Ferrel-type comedy. Two cops who are desk jockeys get thrust into a real case that puts them out on the street in a real case.Mark Wahlberg is OK as the partner, playing the straight man. Ferrell is a dork, married to a beautiful Eva Mendes who is a doctor. And all the beautiful women keep hitting on Ferrell. A typical ploy in these movies, reversing what you'd expect.Stupid story, lot of physical humor. If you like Ferrell, you will like this. Wahlberg is OK. The Rock and Samuel L Jackson also play some funny roles for a bit. But overall, you get what pretty much what you expect in this b-grade type comedy.The Other Guys - nothing great, but I have seen worse. Enjoy.",The Other Guys
115,eshwarmail,It works great if you watch with least expectations and putting your brain on hibernate,7,13 November 2012,"I was skeptical about this and the first 10 minutes of the movie didn't help either. It may not be the best buddy cop parody but the level of slapstick humor can be on par with the Simpsons or Family Guy. Though it has a lot of references, it is original in its own way.Allen Gamble (Will Ferrell) and Terry Hoitz (Mark Wahlberg) are the most under looked cops in their department and both have their histories for it. When a spot opens up after the death of the department's super cops, Terry wants to step in with his reluctant partner. What starts off as a minor scaffolding charge escalates to a multi-million dollar fraud and these two are in the middle of it.Wahlberg reprises his role similar to that of the one he played in The Departed, void his superiority and confidence. Ferrell steals the show occasionally as most of the slapstick humor is handled by him especially the pimp back story part. The late realization of them being bribed part was funny so is Ferrell's constant bickering on his hot girl friends. It is intentionally mindless and was willing to do anything to get a laugh out of you. I don't see any innovation on other departments like music or cinematography but editing is slick.It works great if you watch with least expectations and putting your brain on hibernate.",The Other Guys
116,Ryan_MYeah,"The second act moves too slow, but the movie is just hilarious. Excellent stunt driving, too.",7,2 February 2011,"In the film, Will Ferrell and Mark Wahlberg play Adam Gamble and Terry Hoitz, two desk jockey police officers who seek to get higher notoriety within their division. After the abrupt death of the two most respected cops within the station, they see this as their chance to finally get out of their slump, but they find their plan to bust a huge embezzlement case with a corporate CEO (Played by Steve Coogan) at its center, foiled at every turn by dastardly criminals, and their own faulty antics.The film is written and directed by Adam McKay, whose body of work includes offbeat but exceptionally funny movies such as Anchorman and Talladega Nights. The Other Guys is not always perfect, but it benefits from the perfectly mismatched chemistry of Ferrell and Wahlberg, and gets in some great laughs, which range from witty one-liners to side achingly tickling WTF sight and sound gags. They're joined by a cast that includes Eva Mendes, Michael Keaton and Rob Riggle, who all get in their own unique laughs. Even Dwayne Johnson and Samuel L. Jackson in their small roles are hilarious.While The Other Guys has some serious good points, such as the film's action, which includes some of the year's very best stunt driving and fight choreography, it still has a tendency to feel flawed. Most are simply minuscule and can be forgiven, but the most evident of them all is the film's quest to find consistent rhythm. The first act is a tad too rushed, and the second act is too slow, but the third act finally manages a solid tone.I give The Other Guys **1/2 out of ****",The Other Guys
117,srdjan_veljkovic,It just tries too hard,4,28 January 2016,"What can one say about a movie whose best parts are the 2008 bailout comic during the credits and the joke told post-credits?It's obviously a big-budget movie. If you like those in themselves just because they are not bad, you'll probably like this one too.But, disregarding that, it just tries too hard to be funny. Sometimes it succeeds, but, most often, it doesn't. Though most of the attempts are somewhat interesting, they just don't work. Like Will Ferrell being a babe-magnet without even trying - well, actually actively trying to be babe anti-magnet with his wife, Eva Mendes. The Brooke Shields gag to that effect is interesting, but not very funny.The main problems seems to be that pretty much none of the characters are likable. The police captain, Michael Keaton is the only one that's somewhat likable (well, of course, Eva Mendes is likable, but she has very little screen time). Characters don't have to be smart or nice to be likable, but they still need to express something that one can like.It's not bad, but, not good either.",The Other Guys
118,D_Burke,"""The Other Guys"" Soars, & Will Ferrell Is Finally Funny Again",9,4 August 2010,"Adam McKay is not a household name yet, but movie buffs like me know that when he teams up with Will Ferrell, magic happens. The former ""Saturday Night Live"" writer directed Ferrell in ""Anchorman: The Legend of Ron Burgundy"" (2004), ""Talladega Nights"" (2006), and even the popular viral video ""The Landlord"" (2007). Movies with Ferrell that have not involved McKay have tried to duplicate the success of ""Anchorman"", but have failed ( i.e. ""Semi-Pro"" (2008), ""Land of the Lost"" (2009)).As director and co-writer of ""The Other Guys"", McKay brings the best out of Ferrell, Mark Wahlberg, and the rest of the cast. It combines action and comedy better than any similar comedy I have seen in a long time.""The Other Guys"" refers to, of course, the detectives who rarely get a piece of the archetypal cops-and-robbers shenanigans that are frequently seen in action movies or on ""Law & Order"". They remain mainly at their desks doing paperwork, something almost never seen in movies. Ferrell is Allen Gamble, who is somewhat content with managing case work on his computer, and Wahlberg is the far more forceful and ambitious Terry Hoitz.Their characters are in sharp contrast to the cops that Samuel L. Jackson and Dwayne Johnson portray in this film (and definitely in other films). Although Jackson and Johnson were also funny here, I hate that the previews gave away their cameos in this movie. It would have been more exciting if the audience didn't expect them when they stepped into the theaters. Then again, that is the fault of whomever marketed this film, not the filmmakers themselves.When Allen and Terry start working on a case they have a lead in, one they get to before other senior detectives do, a really interesting detective story progresses that would not feel out of place in dramas like ""The French Connection"" (1971) or similar action/detective movies to that nature.''When you do a comedy, it does no good to reference comedies,'' writer and director Adam McKay told Entertainment Weekly, ''You want to treat it like a drama 80% of the way. Then, at the last 20%, you f**k it up"".The last 20% made this movie work, naturally. More than that, though, Ferrell didn't get all the funny lines, which is the mistake that many buddy cop movies such as the recent ""Cop Out"" (2010) make. Wahlberg is as intense as he usually is in most movies, but he has laugh- out-loud hilarious lines that he plays effectively with a straight face. His line about being a peacock may make AFI's Most Memorable Movie Quote list in the next few years, and the hot water his character got into in an incident involving Derek Jeter (making a cameo as himself) made the audience at my screening cheer. Of course, I saw the movie in Boston, but I'm just saying.However, the 20% of the movie that was funny was further enhanced by the story. Again, many buddy cop movies of recent years that have tried to be ""48 Hours"" make the mistake of introducing the villain early on, similar to a superhero comic book. This movie has you try to solve the mystery along with Ferrell and Wahlberg, and there are some decent twists and turns that really make you wonder who the culprit is.I will say that the mystery was a bit confusing, especially since it involves a Rupert- Murdoch-meets-Donald-Trump tycoon (Steve Coogan) and some financial plot. As a critic, I could pretend to accurately interpret everything that I see on screen. However, I'm not a Wall Street expert, and numbers involved in trading, stocks & bonds, and all the rest confuse me. Nonetheless, even if you watch this movie not knowing who's wrong or right and why, you will still love the ride.The closing credits featured cleverly-animated financial facts pertaining to the recent financial meltdown, which appeared to be meticulously researched but still out of place. Their presence reminded me of Charlie Chaplin's anti-Nazi plea for humanity at the end of ""The Great Dictator"" (1941). His speech didn't fit the slapstick comedy of the first 90% of the movie, but looking back, it was still necessary to hear. I feel as though this montage of facts may have the same effect.Overall, though, ""The Other Guys"" is not just another movie. Some gags seemed a bit out of place, and the tired plot point of the police chief pulling the main cops off the case still seeped its way into the story. However, it helped that that chief was Michael Keaton in what could be a comeback performance, and that he had some hysterical lines as well. The movie tells a great story, everyone in the movie is funny without appearing to try too hard (especially in Ferrell's case), and the ensemble cast works together perfectly. In a year of mediocre (non-animated) comedies, ""The Other Guys"" lives up to its hype.",The Other Guys
119,illbebackreviews,An okay film to be completely fair,3,1 December 2012,"I'll be completely honest with this film. A friend of mine told me to watch 'The Other Guys' and so I gave it a go. I was particularly excited to see the great Samuel L Jackson, to see Dwayne Johnson and also so excited to see Will Ferrel and star from Ted, Mark Walberg. The film started off extremely well, but soon things began to fall downhill. The start of the film, that is until Jackson and Johnson's characters were killed, was extremely funny with great action making the premise of the story exciting. After their deaths, things went all quiet and the film lost its tone. Don't get me wrong. I thought that pretty much all the actors did a good job in this film, in particularly Will Ferrel who had some of the funnier moments, but I just don't understand what many people love this film so much. I mean, sure it had some laughs, but the plot has been so overused in many films, its actually quite boring after a little whileIn my honest opinion, I myself wouldn't recommend this to those action/comedy fans as I myself am one. Being a huge fan of the Rush Hour series, Lethal Weapon and Die Hard, I found the action in this film extremely boring and the cinematography very ordinary. The script itself isn't very inspirational, the character development doesn't really occur and things don't go that well.",The Other Guys
120,Hallelujah289,Outstanding!,9,21 June 2020,"Have watched this film before, but failed to appreciate its comedic gold. Outlandish, incredible, everyone has a hilarious secret talent. Also, Will Ferrell has a ""plain wife"" in Eva Mendes, the police captain works in Bed Bath and Beyond to support his bisexual son going to NYU, and Dwayne Johnson and Samuel L Jackson miss the bushes. That last part alone makes this film. Don't miss it. You'll know what I'm talking about.Really hard to fault this film. It's underrated. I guess the crime plot gets a little lost and I couldn't keep up with the suspects or their goals exactly.

Some are laugh-out-loud hilarious while others while make you sit expressionless. I didn't have the highest hopes of this film, and I didn't receive the best of it either... The first thing that intrigued me was the actors. Okay, seems like a typical role for Will Ferrell, but Mark Wahlberg? Things are about to get interesting.. They both played the role well, but this leads me to the next thing; the humor. Typical comedies have this thing about jokes about penis. I consider this a type of humor, as it doesn't think of clever responses, but inserting the word 'penis' and it ends up hilarious. The Other Guys.. not so much. The humor was very dry and sarcastic and you've got to pay attention to the story to get the humor. Me, I'm not a fan of this type of humor as it seems too stupid. This is coming from a person who likes Step Brothers, 21 Jump Street, and the Hangover, but the director seemed to lose his toll. The jokes were fast and clean, and I have to admit, some parts made me laugh, but overall the humor just wasn't my thing. Everything else was okay in my opinion, but the movie's humor just fell short, as it wasn't my thing...SHOULD YOU WATCH IT?

122,canuckteach,See 'Another Movie' instead..,5,8 February 2015,"Notwithstanding the pleas for higher ratings from our beloved colleagues here at IMDb, I am recommending you pass. I really wanted Will Ferrell, and Mark Wahlberg to be funny, but, the truth is, after less than an hour, I turned it off, not really caring how the story ends, or how the main characters fare (just so readers don't accuse me of 'not giving it a chance').Hollywood has trouble turning out non-clichéd comedies these days - and this is an iteration of the 'cop-buddy' movie, with silly robberies, hijacks, and idiot violence (sometimes self-inflicted, as in the case of the 2 heroic cops envied by Wahlberg and Ferrell. Ferrell (who plays an accountant type) is a nerdy pencil-pusher married to a drop-dead gorgeous woman (Eve Mendes) -- a hot-tempered Wahlberg has been busted to a desk job after accidentally shooting a celebrity mistaken for a mugger (maybe the only original funny bit in the whole movie). These two yearn for the action of genuine police work in the street, but are ill-matched to work as a team, Wahlberg frequently criticizing everything about Ferrel (including his feminine farts). The two try to resolve their differences, but this regresses back to hostility several times in the film, when the writers realized there wasn't going to be anything else to laugh at.Lazy writing, a lack of genuinely-original material, and uneven development of character & plot leave you with a sense that the whole thing was conceived over several drinks at a frat party (where proper masculine farting was, no doubt, exhibited en masse).",The Other Guys
123,paudie,Has some funny moments but nothing special,7,16 October 2010,"The idea for this movie is pretty good. A spoof of the cop/buddy movie that everyone is so familiar with. So after the most successful detective partnership in the NY police (Samuel L Jackson and Dwayne Johnson) come to a sticky end disgraced detective Mark Wahlberg decides to get back in the good books with his bosses by taking up where they left off. Unfortunately his partner (played by Will Ferrell) is an accountant at heart rather than a cop. They get assigned to a fraud case that turns out to be bigger than they thought. There are obvious opportunities for chalk and cheese comedy situations and these are taken. However most of these don't quite come off. Ferrell and Wahlberg do pretty well but some scenes (many seem to be improvised) go on too long and aren't funny enough. Some of them even reminded me of the awful ""Step Brothers"", where Ferrell was also Executive Producer.Steve Coogan, Michael Keaton and Eva Mendes do well in supporting roles and there are a few good laughs. However IMO the film doesn't quite come together as well as it might.Get it out on DVD on a night the selection isn't that great.",The Other Guys
124,kevinxirau,This peacock sure can fly.,8,1 December 2011,"Wow, this was unexpected. Compared to most cop films, this is a fresh, hilarious, and highly original movie. It took what was essentially an ordinary-guy-rising-up story and brought it to a whole new level. There are heroes and then there are the Other Guys.When the city is in need of protection, somebody has to step in as it's next generation of heroes. However, those heroes are a rather odd and mismatched duo: the docile and nerdy Allen Gamble (Will Ferrell) and the tough and aggressive Terry Hoitz (Mark Wahlberg).

With excellent comedy, cool action, and an all-star cast, this movie will bring joy and laughs to you from beginning to end.

Will is funny in a sense, his SNL days were hilarious but his acting is atrocious. Having an opening where we see the top cops Samuel L. Jackson and The Rock is a fun beginning, however they both exit early which is unfair. Utilizing a good ensemble of a cast with Eva Mendes, Ray Stevenson, Rob Riggle and Damon Wayans Jr. was unique in it's own way.

126,monkeysgalore,The Other Guys: An Excellent Action Comedy and Satire,10,29 October 2018,"I have to say, I did not expect this film to be as good as it was. Another great addition to the buddy cop genre, as well as a satire of it, this film has huge laughs, and good action sequences. I really can not for the life of me understand why this movie catches so much hate as I've seen in other reviews here. Yes, there are some weak points, as with any movie, but the good HEAVILY overshadows the bad.Will Ferrel and Mark Wahlberg star as Allen Gamble and Terry Hoitz, two under-achieving New York cops who, along with everyone else on the force, live in the shadow of the two super-cops, Christopher Danson (Dwayne Johnson) and P.K. Highsmith (Samuel L. Jackson). When an unexpected turn of events puts Danson and Highsmith out of commission, Allen and Terry decide to step up and take on an investigation of their own, leading to a tangle with foreign operatives, and an arrogant billionaire.The Other Guys knows what it wants to be, and it achieves its goal in spades. People should know what they're getting into with this, as it delivers exactly what it advertises; a spoof of the 'buddy cop' genre, and a fast-paced action comedy for anyone to enjoy.I don't understand how a lot of people cannot find anything in this movie funny. From start to finish, I found it hilarious, and laughed out loud several times. There's just as much smart humor and witty interplay between characters as there is random, often weird humor that is present in many of Ferrel's films, and the writing manages to balance the smart humor and the random, sometimes dumb humor very well. There are definitely some loud, sometimes obnoxious moments, such as Ferrel's occasional outbursts, and his 'Gator' emotional episodes, especially the ""Pimps Don't Cry"" music number, but aside from those small instances, I really had a ball watching this.The movie starts, and ends, with action, and in between are a bunch of great moments. There's an intense opening car chase, a parking lot fight scene, an office building shootout, and an intense-action-packed final car chase and standoff that I really enjoyed, especially considering the tone of the film. I think it's important to note that even though this film is, at heart, a comedy, the action remains serious, and it's never really slapstick or funny. The first and last car chases were especially entertaining, and they felt very ""Bad Boys""-ish.Ferrel and Wahlberg have great chemistry, and their constant bickering and clashing of personalities really is consistently funny. They both throw themselves into their roles, and their dedication made this movie that much more fun. Ferrell is hilarious, time and again proving himself as one of the best comedy actors out there (you can't help but laugh just by looking at him), and Wahlberg is one of my favorite actors, so it was a joy to watch them together. Michael Keaton also delivered a hilarious, underrated performance, so props to him.Overall, I highly, highly recommend it, to both fans of the genre, and fans of the actors. 10/10.",The Other Guys
127,BigGuy,Started Strong and Faded,5,8 August 2010,"I thought this movie started out pretty well. In particular an early scene between Wahlberg and Ferrel had me rolling. But after that the movie went flat. There were still some good moments throughout the movie, but for me a lot of the jokes were flat. Actually, from the response of most of the audience that opening bit was the comedic high point.Also, the movie did get preachy about the current economic crisis, corporate bailouts, etc. This was especially the case at the end of the movie and current the closing credits. It was all to make a single joke that no one in the audience laughed at.Action Comedies are tricky and require the proper cast to pull it off. Will Ferrel did a pretty good job, but wasn't perfect. Mark Walhberg however didn't uphold his part as the straight man. Rather than play it straight, he was just flat, he played Mark Walhberg.",The Other Guys
128,colinrgeorge,The Only Guys,7,17 August 2010,"Maybe I'm rebounding off of the mediocre ""Dinner for Schmucks,"" or maybe I'm rebounding off of an entire season of lackluster comedy; either way, ""The Other Guys"" is like a breath of fresh air. It feels like eons since anyone's batted a consistent laugh average—But Adam McKay and Will Ferrell do reliably that. It might seem like a passive aggressive compliment, but in this chortle-starved summer beggars can't be choosers.At its most embryonic state, the movie works because it's built on the solid, if elementary, foundation of pairing Ferrell with Mark Wahlberg. Wahlberg has a deft, underexploited comedic potential that he, his agent, or whoever, has critically ignored. Roles like his in ""Boogie Nights"" and ""I Heart Huckabees"" make a case for an actor that should lay off the heavy drama every so often and recoil with something silly. I honestly believe Wahlberg is the best part of the epically awful ""Happening,"" and that there isn't an ounce of his performance that isn't calculated—How anyone could read Shyamalan's script and not burst out laughing is beyond me.His pairing with Ferrell is a match made in comedy heaven, and the two play off each other well. Of course, this is a more restrained Ferrell than many may have expected, but it's a role that suits him following his over-the-top performance in ""Step Brothers."" Besides, when released from the shackles of his character—Paper-pushing ""fake cop"" Allen Gamble— Ferrell's performance is hit and miss. Exploding into a shrieking rage during a 'Good Cop, Bad Cop' routine gone awry is one of the film's funniest moments. Revealing his ex-life as a flamboyant pimp? Not so much.But even with its pecking detractors, ""The Other Guys"" is never unfunny for long. Once we've established our two protagonists—Via a bizarre and amusing lion and tuna metaphor—It is generally fun just to watch them blunder their way through the rest of the movie. Wahlberg's character is Terry Hoitz, Allen's partner, and the short-fused catalyst for his first big trip out of the office. Their dynamic warmly satirizes the eighties buddy cop cliché, but more often is a simply a vehicle for short-form character sketches.If there is a problem with the movie, it's that the plot is astronomically overcomplicated, neither clever nor compelling. Laughter is usually the only bridge connecting one idea to the next, and the constituent scenes sometimes fail to function as a unit. Worse yet, terrific performers like Steve Coogan are stuffed into straight-man roles, and ought to be espousing humor, not plot.Regardless, this movie has it where it counts. Its lack of focus may detract slightly from the overall experience, but it only serves to highlight what ""The Other Guys"" ultimately is— Mindless summer entertainment. My approach to comedy has always been that character is paramount, but when you're knocking off something like this, the only thing that really matters is its ability to make me laugh. And for the first time in months, I feel like I got my funny bone's worth.Ferrell and McKay never pretend to be auteurs of deep or provocative comedy—Jay Roach of ""Dinner for Schmucks"" didn't either—But I laughed more. Much more. There's a reason comedy is called the most subjective genre; a movie like this is dangerous because when you put all your chips on the gags, you're going all or nothing—Either you'll find ""The Other Guys"" funny or you won't. For me, the film is a return to form for a duo that has disappointed me with their previous two efforts; its no ""Anchorman,"" but it's far and away superior to ""Talladega Nights"" and more consistent than ""Step Brothers.""More importantly, it's far and away superior to ""Dinner for Schmucks"" and whatever other marginally amusing film is concurrently playing. In a summer of lackluster comedy, every chortle should be cherished, and ""The Other Guys"" has them to spare.",The Other Guys
129,thekyles99,Delivers all the laughs promised in the trailer and then some!,8,29 August 2010,"Now this is the movie i like, one that promises plenty of laughs in the trailer and delivers and then some. I am very surprised with Mark Wahlberg even though he is in my top 5 fave actors of all time list, i was still leery on him doing comedy. He was brilliant in his own tough guy sarcastic way and it worked. His ""want to keep low key "" partner Allen Gamble, played very excellently by Will Farrell is assigned to Detective Terry Holtz (Wahlberg) Allan just likes his cushy desk job where he gets in no trouble and goes home safely every night to his ""bad-a-lax"" as he puts it wife. I need to mention the so called bad-a-lax is played by the beautiful Eva Mendez. Terry is a cop who in an accidental shooting of Yankees superstar Derek Jeter gets stuck with Allan. Terry is very angry and Allan is very timid together they are one of the most miss matched cop pairing since Danny Glover and Mel Gibson in the Lethal Weapon series. Enter the super cop pairing of Christopher Danson (Dwayne Johnson) and P.K Highsmith (Samuel Jackson) These cops are the creme of the nypd and the envy of the whole police dept. When something happens to them Allan and Terry try their best amidst loads of hilarious back and forth banter to take their places. Nice to see Michael Keaton back on the big screen as their captain.

131,blacklist-1,"A brilliant start, substituted for an average middle and terrible end.",5,10 May 2017,"For the first thirty minutes The Other Guys promises to be one of the best comedies of the year and a rating of a nine or ten. With witty dialogue, extremely funny jokes and great acting from Will Farrell, Mark Wahlberg, Samuel L Jackson and Dwayne Johnson, (the Rock). Farrell is at his funniest at first as a mild-mannered ""forensic accountant"" with no ambition to get out from behind his desk. He got into policing because he liked all the paperwork. Wahlberg is just as amusing as his reluctant partner, a frustrated man of action with anger management issues, especially when it comes to his partner. Trigger management is another problem. He's been confined to desk duties ever since he accidentally shot a famous baseball-player for trespassing in his own stadium.Several funny sequences early on are funny with the dialogue witty. One in particular is a classical exchange of conversation between Farrell and Wahlberg about which would win in a fight between lions and a tuna. There's a clever moment when they experience just how loud one of those explosions is when you're close to it – not at all like it is in the movies. Also Johnson and Jackson appearing twice in a small cameo get some great jokes, with how they are allowed to get away with millions of dollars in collateral damage in order to make a minor drugs bust. Also the part when they jump off a twenty storey building to go after some criminals who raided a jewelry store, where they say they will land in the ""bush,"" but splatter themselves to death on the pavement is a classic. I also enjoyed the absurdity of the fight between cops at a funeral, with all of them whispering insults as they roll around on the floor, so as not to be disrespectful of the dead. The first half hour is directed with skill by Adam McKay as the laughs keep constantly coming keeping me highly entertained. So why do I give this only a five star out of a ten? That's because after thirty minutes have past. The film becomes desperately dull as Jackson and Johnson disappear with a lot of the fun. A plot of white coaler crime involving a dodgy financier Steve Coogan is boring and uninvolving with Coogan being deeply unfunny. The jokes with respect to the script become repetitive like when Walhberg kept saying how hot Farrel's wife is played by Eva Mendes at least five times, dreary catchphrases and some disgusting jokes about homeless people having orgies in a car and jokes about urination and penises put me right off. It's as though the scriptwriters have been replaced by someone who hasn't got a clue how to write one. The second half hour isn't too bad as I did chuckle a few times but the last forty five minutes is at it's worst with me only laughing twice as the comedy all but disappeared. Another problem for me after thirty minutes was that Farrell and Walhberg started to get on my nerves, particularly Walhberg who kept shouting all the time. It was hard to award this in the end as it started off as a nine or a ten and then dwindled down to a one, so I compromised with a five star. I'm glad I saw the first half hour, but in the end I was extremely disappointed as in terms of wasted comic potential it's the most disappointing picture of the year.",The Other Guys

134,Jakealope,Very Lame & Unbearable,3,26 February 2011,"Not that I was a big fan of Step Brothers, but that was a way better movie than this schlock fest. In SB, Ferrell had John C Riley to work with as well as a ""family"" of good actors to play straight people against those two overgrown boys. It was an inherently absurd comedic premise to begin that this one lacked.This one used the detective ""buddy"" movie plot, which was over worked about 20 years ago. Then add Marky Mark as Ferrel's partner, one of the most wooden and over-rated actors today, and it just plain sucked. It had the same sort of junior high wimp and fag bashing humor that was barely tolerable in Step but less so here. For instance, Marky Mark's character learned ballet when younger just so he could torment a ballet dancer fellow youth. Funny?, maybe! It also shared the same writers and some supporting actors as that one too. Even the opening scene, a total bs chase scene and shootout between the soon to be dead super cops and some stock rapper bad guys was just the same sort of over the top crappola that is the norm for about half the action movies these days.Also, the plot was well nigh non existent. Basically it was Ferrell playing this really nerdy cop, but with some sort of sex appeal with Eva Mendez as his wife and a past that included being a collegiate pimp. Marky plays some really angry low life kick ass sort of cop, who openly abuses and despises his unwanted nerdy partner. A bunch of jokes revolve around Ferrell's Prius and street people using it for orgies, really crude. Why this movie did better than Step Brothers is beyond me since Step Brothers had a simple 3 Stooges type of setup while this was just bad parody. The same super reviewers who panned that one seemed to praise this one, why?",The Other Guys
135,Bravesfan17,Will Ferrell has redeemed himself with a hilarious movie.,8,14 August 2010,"The Other Guys marks the fourth collaboration between actor Will Ferrell and director Adam McKay. Will Ferrell has redeemed himself as a comedy actor after the ever awful Land of the Lost. Ferrell stars with Mark Wahlberg as two detectives who only work in the office and rarely go out to take on cases. Ferrell's character, Allen Gamble is always in the office by choice, while Wahlberg's character, Terry Hoitz, is not.For a while it is because of two of New York's best cops, played by Smauel L. Jackson and Dwayne Johnson. However, they die by jumping off a building. Now Gamble and Hoitz are wanting to step in and be the best cops.Ferrell and Wahlberg are hilarious as Allen is a bit uptight while Terry is acting tough all the time. Michael Keaton does some fine work as the police chief, who also works at Bed Bath and Beyond. Eva Mendes does some good, funny work as Allen's wife.McKay knows how to get the performances he wants out of his actors, especially Ferrell and Mendes. Anyone who likes Ferrell comedies such as Talladega Nights, Blades of Glory, Step Brothers, and Old School should check out the other guys.",The Other Guys
136,Jonathon_Natsis,Just Another Movie,6,1 February 2011,"Will Ferrell, Hollywood's staple man in comedy for some years now, re-teams with director Adam McKay for The Other Guys, a buddy-cop comedy that definitely has its moments, but is ultimately nothing you haven't already seen before. Ferrell typically delivers his best work alongside McKay (their co-op resume includes such laugh riots as Anchorman, Talladega Nights and Step Brothers) and this time they bring along hardman Mark Wahlberg, relishing the opportunity to somewhat break the mould and showcase his comedic talents.The mismatched pair plays Allen Gamble (Ferrell) and Terry Hoitz (Wahlberg). The former is content to sit at his desk filing paperwork all day for the local police station, while the latter would rather be out on the streets, making a real difference in the city. Due to a, let's say, lack of staff, they are put on the case of shifty tycoon David Ershon, who's felonies turn out to be more serious than just his failure to apply for a scaffolding permit.From the outset, it's clear Ferrell and Wahlberg enjoyed their time on the set. While the plot, set pieces and screenplay display little to no innovation, it is the chemistry between the two leads that regularly delivers laughs out of situations that could have fallen very flat with the wrong combination. With such a stale, oft-worked film genre, it is difficult for those involved to keep the audience's attention solely on the comedy. They don't exactly reinvent the wheel, but Will and Mark work wonders with what they have.Running jokes grow tiresome after a while, though. Subliminal TLC references from Michael Keaton's (remember, he used to be Batman?) police captain and Allen's subconscious ability to attract beautiful women are, frankly, used too often at times where other, more refreshing ideas could have been exploited. But going back to the subject of actor combinations, an honourable mention must go to Samuel L. Jackson and Dwayne John- who am I kidding, he's still The Rock, who play the heroic cop stereotypes to great effect. Their final scene is arguably the funniest in the entire film, combining music, slow-motion and a throwaway line so appropriate it's already earnt itself a spot in the Urban Dictionary. And well done to McKay for adhering to Article 39 of the Movie Code: Any film post-1994 starring Jackson must contain at least one Pulp Fiction reference.On the whole, I had feelings of indifference towards The Other Guys. Because this is one of those disheartening final products in which the funniest parts were packed into a two-and- a-half-minute trailer, I left inarguably underwhelmed. I wouldn't discourage anyone who hasn't seen it to go and watch, but certainly feel under no compulsion to watch it again myself, or anticipate its home release. A lack of depth in most technical filmmaking categories, but points for Ferrell, Wahlberg and most of the cast for efforts that produce satisfactory results, just about the definition of 'average.'*There's nothing I love more than a bit of feedback, good or bad.

137,OneAnjel,A lot of laugh out loud moments,9,2 February 2021,"Very clever comedy. Two misfit cops -- one with a runt complex who needs to prove he's tough, complete with anger issues; and one who is unexpectedly arrogant and a naïve perfectionist but a dumbass with an unlikely hot wife... I think Will and Mark must have had a blast making this film. The Rock and Jackson are well-cast but are not the main part of the film after what can only be called a hysterical decision based on an immortality complex. I found the characters to be well-formed and over the top, making them all a relevant part of the movie. There are plenty of dysfunctional thought processes and laugh out loud moments with a lot of attention to detail. I think people who didn't find this film hysterical were sleep walking.",The Other Guys
138,schroeder-gustavo,"Funny, but mostly inconsistent",6,9 September 2015,"To be completely honest I absolutely love about the first 15 to 20 minutes of The Other Guys. It sets the bar pretty high for a movie that unfortunately can't really keep up with those standards.Every scene Dwayne Johnson and Samuel L. Jackson are in are absolutely hilarious. The problem is there aren't many scenes in which they are in. Ferrell and Wahlberg do a great job with the script they are given and I just have to say this movie did make me laugh out loud in quite a few scenes. But the laughs aren't consistent and I thought most of the humor was pretty low brow, the kind of things that may look great on paper, but when executed may not work as well as expected.The parts of the movie that I liked I really liked and I didn't really dislike the other parts of the movie, I just thought they were OK. The good parts of it are actually pretty quotable, so I have to say I enjoyed the Other Guys even though it is an inconsistent movie that could have been funnier.",The Other Guys
139,chelano,Wahlberg - The angry cop,7,13 August 2010,"OK first off I will say that the story was just OK. But that usually happens in comedies. So you have to rely more on the film trying to make the viewer laugh. If you are a fan of Will Ferrell's comedy and Mark Wahlberg, then you will pretty much laugh throughout the film. Ferrell really gets to act like himself in this film. I mean he is playing a character, but he gets to use his typical humor. Wahlberg plays a really angry cop and some of the things that come out of his mouth will really get you laughing. I actually laughed more at Wahlberg than Ferrell. Samuel L. Jackson and Dwayne Johnson are in the film a bit as the head cops; like a newer Starsky and Hutch. They were entertaining. Eva Mendes plays Ferrell's wife and she is actually entertaining. Then the chief of the police station is played by Michael Keaton. Throughout the movie he kept quoting from the group TLC. He was actually also pretty funny. You will find yourself laughing a lot throughout the film. But there are some parts where they do try to be serious and most of the time it can be a turn off in a good comedy. There are some great one liners and scenes that will stick in your mind. So a pretty good comedy and I will end by saying, I want to see Mark Mahlberg do more comedic roles, because he is pretty good in them.",The Other Guys
140,sakram,Seriously ? Is that it ?,3,3 April 2018,"Yep, I shut this movie down only halfway, 'cause oh boy is the cringe real.
I've never cringed so much during a movie, the ""vulgar"" jokes can sometimes work but the way they are used in this movie just puts me to puke. I don't get it. The budget wasted on this movie, including the stars which the main actors are, you might at least hire a guy that knows what he's doing, but the Director (Adam McKay) decided to do it almost on his own, co-operating with Chris Henchy. Eventually it turned out to be the worst script you could ever get, even worse than many B-level movies.
Script : Absolutely an F, out of god-knows how many lines there are in this movie, maybe a thousand ? only 3 or 4 lines are funny, the rest is pure $hît.
Acting : It looked like the actors knew something was up with the script and was doing it only for money, I won't say they were bad, but this surely is due to the script.
Editing : What' wrong with the Audio, and the trim-editing ? It even had me yawning more.
The first chapter of this movie (15min or so) were okay, but after that, it was a huge mess, a disgrace to comedy.Save your time and money, this is not the kind of movie you'd go if you are looking for the good-laugh-comedy.",The Other Guys

Instead of spending huge amounts of money on massive chase scenes that really didn't add anything to the show they should have spent money on writers who know comedy.

But to my eyes, this movie truly deserves it's 10 star rating. In The Other Guys, there wasn't a minute in which I felt bored, or started looking at my watch. There wasn't a minute in which I wasn't either laughing my a** off or being captivated by the action sequences. The chemistry between Wahlberg and Ferrell works very well, but the real highlight of the film comes from the first 10 or 15 minutes with Highsmith and Davidson (Samuel L. Jackson and Dwayne ''The Rock'' Johnson), who come out as two crazy cops who deliver both a load of action and laughs. too bad we didn't see them more.I don't want to say much about this film's plot but I can assure you that you will definitely laugh, and thus, more than once. Of course it's a Will Ferrell movie, and his style seems to be a love it/hate it type of humour, and it is shown a bit in this film so if you are bothered with his style maybe you shouldn't see it, but if you enjoy his style then there is no reason you shouldn't see this film. Ferrell had me laughing a lot and so did Mark Wahlberg, shown here in a style of movie we aren't used to see him. Surprisingly, his funny lines come out better than expected (I'll never look at that actor the same way since his performance in the Departed, one of the greatest performances ever), and even more laughs came from other small roles, such as Eva Mendes and Brooke Shields. In all it's the funniest movie of the year so far, and it definitely has a chance at scoring high during the Golden Globes next Februray. Go see it now!",The Other Guys

149,JimD73,"Unfunny and incoherent, but thats from a non-fan of Ferrell",3,6 October 2010,"I should admit something immediately: I'm not a big Will Ferrell fan. Sure, he was really funny on SNL and for some reason I loved Talladega Nights, but Anchorman and Step Brothers were both very mediocre in my eyes. As such, fans can simply ignore everything I say from here on in, because while they will certainly enjoy it, The Other Guys was a huge disappointment in my eyes.The film would have worked great if it had ended twenty minutes in, for the first act was indeed hilarious. Featuring Samuel L Jackson and Dwayne Johnson (who really needs to do a real action movie soon) as hotshot cops with Mark Wahlberg and Will Ferrell stuck at their desks, laughs come quite fast at the start. Conversations about land tuna do well to contrast the ludicrous action sequences.However, once Wahlberg and Ferrell hit the streets, the movie loses all momentum. Various one-note jokes are stretched far too thin, such as Ferrell being irresistible to women or Wahlberg being blamed for shooting Derek Jeter, and most of the other laughs are in the trailer. A revelation about Ferrell's past is random enough to get some laughs, but is quickly overused.The actors do little to lift the material. Jackson and Johnson are great, but limited in screen time. Rob Riggle and Damon Wayans Jr also manage to get the lions share of the second half's laughs despite their small roles. Ferrell's role is too inconsistent, playing up the Ferrell-esquire idiot role to be believable as the functioning member of society the rest of the film expects him to be. Wahlberg starts out as a great straight man, but as he joins the lunacy any barometer of sanity is lost. Michael Keaton never sinks low, but the TLC-oriented jokes around his character grow weak.I really can't say much more than that I didn't find The Other Guys that funny. It was a mostly laughless experience with a good opening, loose plot and ludicrous ending, but fans of Ferrell-McKay movies will likely enjoy it. I just can't claim to be part of that group.",The Other Guys

And only a man named Will Ferrell will do all these acts just because he can. The Other Guys succeeds in further extending McKay's and Ferrell's track record for being the most haphazardly ambitious comedians in Hollywood.A quarter pound of illegal drugs needs to be recovered, and twelve million dollars worth of property damage later, they are recovered. No thanks are due to New York City's cockiest detectives Danson and Highsmith, who are uproariously played by Dwayne Johnson and Samuel L. Jackson. But they are not what this movie is about. Living beneath, far beneath their shadows are Allen Gamble and Terry Hoitz.Danson's and Highsmith's spotlight are later emptied for reasons I shall not discuss, and Terry notices that vacant spotlight and desires to fill it at the first opportunity that he can. But he can't do it alone, and must first convince Allen to go with him in the field and prove themselves worthy of more than mere paperwork at a desk. Oh, but Allen has different, less dangerous goals than Terry, which inspires some exchange of words, a few dozen fights, and a couple of felonies if I'm not mistaken.Read more here: http://localmoviereview.com/the-other-guys/",The Other Guys
152,SPaS,Perfect rebound for Ferrell; optimum comedic performance by Wahlberg,7,8 September 2010,"Yep, I enjoyed almost every minute of this movie. To sum it up short, it's like the best of Ferrell, cut short on where the jokes go too long and awkward. Combined with jokes written just right for Wahlberg (he did worse in ""Big hit""). Combined with action a cut above the rest (for the genre), the chemistry between the duo, and the unbelievable home-run ratio of the ""awkward jokes"" (TLC quotes by Keaton for example). Topped with some VERY funny cameos. Direction is all good, along with the editing. The movie showed signs of running out of steam in the middle, but towards the end it picked up the momentum again and ended on a high-enough-note.

All these characters are nearly indistinguishable. Cookie cut.That said, this loud, abrasive, and sporadically funny offering is a mild guilty pleasure. What it lacks is restraint and a pinch of smarts. The over-the-top approach becomes wearying and dilutes the proceedings. Some of it is damn funny though. As an attempt at satirizing buddy-cop movies, it's moderately successful.It's also another entry in the male driven, homophobic oeuvre prevalent in American cinema. Here it's subtext rather than main device. Thank God for small favors.Marky-Mark is lost in the constant screaming he's been directed toward. Ferrell is trademark Ferrell. Eve Mendes has a nice turn as Ferrell's wife. It was also a treat to see Michael Keaton back in the saddle spoofing characters who supervised his out-of-control cop behavior.A passable time filler.

Mark just proves how versatile an actor he can and and he is truly naturally funny in this and he and Will bounce off each other comedically in a beautiful way. It's also a very well built serious crime based plot but also a pretty solid detective parody. Not to mention the cast in this comedy is pretty ridiculous.

158,garyvanhorn,A winning buddy movie.,8,10 January 2011,"The Other Guys deceptively opens with a police chase that features P.K. Highsmith ( Samuel L. Jackson) and Christopher Danson (Dwayne Johnson) as the two most kick ass cops in New York. The scene establishes the tone of the movie as completely ridiculous as well as entertaining, The Other Guys does a wonderful job of not taking itself seriously and the humor just gushes forth.Allen Gamble (Will Ferrell) and Terry Hoitz (Mark Whalberg) are a hopelessly mismatched pair of NYC Detectives that are stuck behind desks doing the paperwork for the big shot hero cops, Highsmith and Danson. Gamble is a complete nerd and is very happy to sit behind a desk, but his partner is more action oriented and when Highsmith and Danson are killed in the line of duty (it's a silly death) Hoitz drags Gamble away from the desk at gunpoint to the scene of the latest high-profile crime. Thus the buddy movie formula begins as the unlikely duo seek to track down the criminal mastermind of a $32 billion financial fraud that nobody believes is happening.Whalberg has a gift for comedy and his delivery really helps ground the insanity of the film and make it just that much funnier. Will Farrell is very much at the top of his game. His humor is more mature and less in-your-face for most of the film, which makes it even funnier in those moments where he really lets loose and steals the spotlight. The movie makes great use of recurring comedic themes and callbacks without overdoing it and the supporting cast, especially Captain Gene Mauch (Michael Keaton), is very good.

The simplistic story has some relating points, though the scenarios and setups in between is what makes this an amusing ride that has capability of repeating and reliving.Two NYPD detectives are begrudgingly assigned together and have to maintain the partner's code which entails getting each other's backs, except they have nothing in common to the point of being the absolute antithesis of one another. Terry Hoitz (Mark Wahlberg) is a man's man who's more street wise than book smart and also doesn't express himself through anything but anger and disapproval: a yell, a smirk, a cold stare at the slightest slip in his chauvinist view. Allen Gamble (Will Ferrell) is a learned but gullible man who's the everybody-make-fun-of guy due to everything he does going strictly by the book, not to mention looking like a straight-edge accountant that he is who plays it safe behind his desk, outdated specs and the wheels of a Prius.The super cops--more like ""superstars""--of the department get first dibs on calls and are practically treated like royalty. Highsmith (Samuel L. Jackson) and Danson (Dwayne Johnson) wear their shades, flashy clothing and drive their muscle cars, except until they unexpectedly check out early and someone else takes their place in front of the cameras and press stands. Hoitz wants him and his tight-end partner to step up after being stuck behind a desk--or as he puts it ""I am a peacock, you gotta let me fly!""--by doing everyone else's paper work. Except first they have some competition with the wise crackin' partners Martin (Rob Riggle) and Fosse (Damon Wayans Jr.) who can't help to mess with Gamble, such as making him do a ""desk pop"" and fire his gun in the office as if it's just some supposed initiation. Gamble stumbles onto some evidence after making what seems to be a pointless arrest for a financial investor named David Ershon (Steve Coogan). After the Captain (Michael Keaton) tells them to repeatedly back off, they still urge ahead as they have a gut hunch and suspect something fishy's going with other people's money. That is only after they get bribed to sports games and concerts but are too stupid to realize, not to mention are being chased by a ruthless security team headed by an Australian named Wesley (Ray Stevenson) who keeps rolling a bolder in their path.As dorky as Gamble is you realize there's another side to him, such as for some reason attracting all the fine ladies without even having to try. Hoitz is a straight shooter that you find out has something in him but is afraid to let it out, such as secretly knowing ballet, but only because he wanted to imitate how ""queer"" it was when younger. They have to prove themselves and reverse the decisions that landed them to desk jockey duty instead of being out there with the big boys. But first they have to dodge a couple of reprimands from the Captain who needs to keep his guys in line so he can put his bi-sexual son who wants to be a DJ through college. Now it's all about two cops going out on a limb by sifting through the politics and doing what's right. Yep, it's about as cliché as that but the story--still with some relating points about bailouts and Ponzi schemes--isn't the entire emphasis but also the inventive puns, jokes and comedic observations to go along with it about things in general, pop culture and cop movie fare.Similar to ""Cop Out,"" this has everything a bad movie usually has, except the difference is ""The Other Guys"" used its purposeful set-backs to its advantage with consistent timing and the chemistry of a team to pull that off with. Otherwise, it's such an overused convention that rides a fine line that can fall on its face when not pulling off the trick without a hitch. Where would this be without some shoot outs and car chases like a good ol' cop and bad guys story even if they are even more exaggerated than what they're emulating. This is often direct, unashamed, raunchy and mean-spirited, but at the same time hilarious in that it takes it all the way to the hilt without feeling guilty about it. They say some of the most ridiculous lines but while maintaining a completely stern-faced serious look. This has an abundance of I-can't-believe-they-just-went-there snappy jokes with a well-timed comedic side on all fronts that makes this such a thoroughly and highly entertaining and fun experience that should be fresh for some time.",The Other Guys
162,billcarr31,Very enjoyable,8,31 January 2020,"I do not usually watch this kind of film having been put off somewhat by Will Smith and Martin Lawrence. I found it very amusing and laughed a lot, although the plot was bizarre and I lost track sometimes. Keaton was very good and Eva Mendes lovely as ever, a pity she was not given more to do. The car chases were really over the top. One thing though I cannot believe car could be so full of bullet holes and keep moving and none of the occupants even got a scratch. Dwayne Johnson and Jackson had guest appearances, no doubt to get the fans in the cinema, but the film did not really need them!",The Other Guys
163,Legendary_Badass,Classic Will Ferrell,7,4 August 2010,"When New York City's most destructive, er I mean honored, cops Danson and Highsmith (Dwayne ""The Rock"" Johnson and Samuel L Jackson respectively) are out of action, the city must turn to the other guys (hence the film's title). Meet officers Allen Gamble (Will Ferrell) and Terry Hoitz (Mark Wahlberg). Gamble is a buy the book career desk cop while Hoitz is his annoyed partner, essentially banished to this fate for shooting a local hero. The two try to step their game up to impress Captain Gene played by Michael Keaton and become the city's new heroes.I'm reminded of 2004's Starky & Hutch and how the plot forcing the two cops together is a lame excuse to forge gags. I can't make a logical sentence to explain what the bad guy was up to, and the audience isn't expected to give two cents. They paid for classic Will Ferrell high jinks and that's what they are going to get. Allan Gamble is a lot like Frank the Tank from Old School, minus the beer. Once he gets wound up, he's like Frank after a keg stand.Directed by Adam McKay (Anchorman: The Legend of Ron Burgundy), The Other Guys has a familiar composition, though to some degree less outlandish than its forbearer. Some characters are more realistic than others, but their situations and the rest of the world have distinct realism. People die. People also put up with verbal abuse from a spouse in the name of comedy. The most effective way these mildly surreal comedies can cope is to produce laughs, and in the case of The Other Guys there isn't a steady supply but there are enough to make the journey worthwhile. Eva Mendes has a rare comedic turn as Ferrell's plain Jane wife. On the other side of things, Mark Walhberg has little to do other than yell. An effort is made to give Hoitz a conflicted personality; he took up dancing as a kid so that he could better make fun of ""girlie men"". The point of his character should be that he's the normal one.Austin Powers certainly paved the way for what can be included in a PG-13 comedy and The Other Guys doesn't disappoint in serving up off-camera references that would make Horatio Caine flinch. It's an acquired taste, but not every joke goes this low. My personal choice is a long-winded comeback from Gamble about animal eating habits. There's also a competing cop team, Fosse (Damon Wayans Jr.) & Martin (Rob Riggle), who make for unique grade school visitors.The unfortunate truth is that, and as I had suspected, the duo we want the movie to be about is Danson and Highsmith. These guys were splitting my sides. Maybe they couldn't maintain the laughs for a whole movie, but their absence makes it obvious how much funnier the first half of the film is compared to the rest. Regardless, comedy isn't easy and The Other Guys do an admirable job stepping up.",The Other Guys
164,Jackblyth8,Comforting Comedy,8,14 December 2020,"Adam McKay provides us with another comedy/action movie featuring many big names such as Dwayne ""the Rock"" Johnson and Samuel L Jackson. Despite their appearances in the film being cut short, we still see the cool and likeable personalities that they possess. The film, lasting for 116 minutes, sees the pair in action early on, in a dramatised police chase, breaking all boundaries to catch the criminal. Yet, their death is imminent with an ambitious jump towards the trees of Central Park from the top of a skyscraper, landing splat out on the road. This fast paced start sets the stage for two new partners to take their place, hence, the Other Guys. Will Ferrell plays Detective Allen Gamble, a shy, reserved cop who enjoys his job away from danger, his colleague Detective Terry Hoitz, played by Mark Wahlberg, is purposely Allen's diametric opposite, making the partnering strange, and manages to convince Allen to take the case of fraudulent: David Ershon played by Steve Coogan. It is the reality that the two detectives are partners yet are opposites that make them so likeable to the viewers adding comedy to the action. We are left perplexed when seeing Will Ferrell's dominance over his wife, Sheila, a woman clearly more attractive and way out of the protagonist's league, also adding laughs to the film, and Mark Wahlberg's character is just as freaked out and surprised as we are. The two become the perfect pairing and open up to each other, specifically when Allen speaks out about his college days when he was previously a pimp. When the two get split up for taking the case not appointed to them, Terry takes on life in traffic management and Allen to beat patrol, however Allen works the case alone, the two are clearly affected by the split as they each experience family problems, we see Allen's dark personality type come out when Sheila reveals she is pregnant, Allen ends up kicked out of the house. Meanwhile, Terry unsuccessfully attempts to reconnect with his ex-fiancé Francine, who walked out on him due to his furious attitude. Allen convinces Terry to rejoin him on the case and gains the Captains approval to work ""off the books"", the pair go to an investment meeting Ershon is having and realise the $32 billion Ershon seeks is really coming from the NYPD pension fund. The two detectives escape with Ershon to his luxury apartment, not the first time the trio have encountered one another with Ershon bribing them with a comedic loop of prestigious events, the pair attending all from a front row Madison Square Garden Knicks basketball game to a viewing of the Jersey boys, supposing that Ershon can't seem to shrug the duo away. A meeting the next morning taking place at the bank gathers all that Ershon owes money to, including Nigerian investors, yet the meeting is interrupted and the room bursts into action with the introduction of Allen and Terry who aim to halt the transfer and acquire the pension fund, the two detectives transform into full enthusiasts, sliding across the glass table and firing bullets in mid-air. Obtaining the pension fund the two leave the room; Roger Wesley then arrives, a man hired to keep an eye on Ershon by Lendl Global's Pamela Boardman (another investor owed money to from Ershon) and as a delaying tactic, shoots both officers and Ershon in their arms. Eventually, Captain Mauch arrives with police backup, rescuing the two and arresting Ershon for his embezzlement, and Wesley for multiple counts of murders. Terry marries Francine and Allen reunites with Sheila. It is great to see Allen, a conservative man who is content in the safety of his role, step out of his comfort zone, and, Terry who hadn't fired a bullet since he shot Derek Jeter mistakingly at the World Series, becoming the officer he aspired to be. The narrator states at the end of the film that the true heroes are the everyday people who work to make a difference, not the ones who appear in the newspaper or on TV",The Other Guys

(Being soft and gentle and relaxed and as if a switch was flipped, angry, loud and obnoxious to the extreme.) Oh, and little hint, no matter how loud you get or how foolish the subject, yelling is never funny.I understand the whole replace the really two good, crazy cops that were funny because they have acted in police dramas with two cops that should NEVER be given a badge, but you didn't have to kill them off, you could have just had them badly injured somehow and capable of cutting back to them in the hospital for when you needed some more over the top lines to be delivered.

167,nathanschubach,Meh...same ol' Ferrell and Wahlberg routines,4,26 January 2012,"I rented this and lost all interest halfway through. Will Ferrell is sticking to his typical ""serious screaming of absurd ideas"" brand of comedy, which holds hands with his idea of ""play old memorable tunes out of typical-movie context"" to produce humor. Mark Wahlberg is such a great actor that I've seen this character in every one of his movies, except this one is slightly looser than the others. There's also a number of other actors you've seen before and explosions and TLC references that are slightly humorous still today.Call me jaded, but this was an excuse to get Will Ferrell in a somewhat-action oriented movie. I did like the over-the-top beginning and the overall teamup of Samuel L. Jackson and The Rock, but that was short-lived. And Steve Coogan annoys me, ever since seeing 24 Hour Party People. Maybe the movie just wasn't for me, but it was definitely better than Bewitched. D-",The Other Guys

I thought, maybe, that Ferrel was going in a slightly new direction and that there'd be action and chemistry with Mark Whalberg co-starring. What a disappointment! This is a lame attempt at a buddy comedy, almost as bad as COP OUT. The plot is nonsensical and the final confrontation with ""the bad guys"" is so anti-climatic that I didn't even realize that that it was the end. There are zero genuinely funny moments in this film. The humor is forced throughout. A few half-hearted chuckles here and there but that was it. The best part of this movie is the first 10 minutes, with Dwayne ""The Rock"" Johnson and Samuel L. Jackson taking the spotlight as two out of control super-cops. They were so over the top, but they had great chemistry and they were genuinely fun to watch. I can't believe the script wrote these two out to make way for Whalberg and Ferrel to take center stage. The Rock and Jackson should have been kept on to be a foil to the Whalbert-Ferrel pair. But I guess this film would be a Samuel L. Jackson and The Rock movie and not a Will Ferrel comedy. THis was not an offensively bad movie, just boring and lame.",The Other Guys

I don't know what everyone here is smoking, but has to be good, because this movie was as lame as a day at the doctors office. First, the plot. We've seen it so many times, it's gotten to the point of insanity. Two cops, one the straight edge, the other the wild man are teamed up and miraculously solve a crime that has confounded top investigative for years. Not only is the plot terrible (something about a ponzi scheme looting the NYPD pension fund, *yawn*) boring but this movie commits the cardinal sin of movie comedies: IT'S JUST NOT FUNNY! The jokes get old 5 minutes in. The running gag about how beautiful Will Ferrel's wife is and him not appreciating it wasn't funny the first time, and was even less so the fifth time! The two main characters have zero chemistry, and Mark Wahlberg is really annoying in this movie. The supporting cast tries, but they can't do much with this terrible script. I was hoping Michael Keaton would steal the show as the duo's boss, but it wasn't meant to be. The best part is, is that the scriptwriters of this dud and the executive who greenlit this project will be hailed as heroes in Hollywood. That says it all!",The Other Guys

172,ranblackman,A well rounded spoof on buddy cop films.,8,24 July 2019,"Halrious movie. The comedic buddy cop banter between Ferrel and Whalberg is what makes it. This is not a traditional buddy cop film, but more of a sort of parody. It work from that direction both with cop films and life as a cop all together. The premise, of two star dectives, who are so over the top in their personas as to be basic super heroes, due by their own ego, a sort of criticism on such character, who would ordinarily be the lead stars in such films.Alas, they are not. Are two leads are the often forgotten accontants whom handle a more boring, tedious part of the job that is unwanted by everyone else their pretty much. This film follows a case the pick up to make their big break. That is the just of the story, which is the weakest aspect of this film here, yet not enough to kill it. Whalberg and Feral are just way to much fun for that. Feerel is dorky and awkward, almost chillike in his naviety, and Whalberg is straight up pissed. The way they work this into the situations they come into is never dull. Apart from that, they have great chemistry and it seems they deserve other.We also get what we usually get from director Adam Mckay, a certain full knowledge of how crazy things get. This movie is dumb, and knows it's dumb, and knows when to comment and how dumb it is and just goes with itself. It comments on flaws, like the unreality of the effects of explosions, yet still has them.It may be lacking in story, yet it is still funny when it needs to be and action-packed and insane when it needs to be.

If you like comedy you will love this. But if you compare it to their other works (hello Anchorman!) then you will at least bare minimum like this.Ferrell teams up with Mark Wahlberg to form The Other Guys. It's all very Ying and Yang, Ferrell makes the effort, likes the office work and (to his partners dismay) is surprisingly adept with women whereas Wahlberg hates the work, has relationship problems and wants the success 'The Non-Other Guys' have. He's almost as annoying as he was in The Departed.Still, they work, they clash, you laugh, laugh to tears sometimes – particularly (unless you're a descendant of Iron Man) the conversation about the Tuna and the Lion. A scene of comedy perfection, which would make Ron Burgundy proud.The rest of the film has these high notes which you'll have no trouble unearthing yourself, but occasionally takes the vast amount of police action a little to far when some of the humour dries up.

I didn't like that.But of course, the action wasn't the sole aim of the director. It is meant for the comedy genre, and I think it succeeded. It was funny. I especially liked Will Ferrel's character. He was really cute. I kinda related him to Steve Carell's Barry of Dinner for Schmucks. Both nerdy, socially awkward little fellows that are adorable. He worked pretty well with Mark Wahlberg's tough guy character.It didn't amaze me. It's not the best comedy I've seen ever, or of recent times, but I'll be honest, when it comes to comedies, I like really stupid stuff. Like Anchorman and Talladega Nights kind of humor.

And that is precisely because it succeeds by reversing the formula, by flipping the figurative script. Will Ferrell is ""Gamble"" and Mark Wahlberg is ""Hoitz."" They aren't the best detectives in their precinct. They have disastrous chemistry as partners. Gamble is a lumbering, brainy, soft, sensitive oaf. Hoitz is what we imagine a mixed martial artist who secretly dreams about show tunes would be like. Repressed, lashing, confused. Their Captain, played by Michael Keaton, is so over the whole cop's life thing that he moonlights after hours selling scented candles.A lot like most of us, when bad guys roll into town and start blowing things up, Gamble and Hoitz are nobody's first choice to get the collar. But they draw the assignment, and all they have to work with to get the job done is each other (quite literally in Gamble's case, when he is denied permission to use an essential and basic tool of policework, for the common good). Hilarity ensues, and Steve Coogan, Ray Stevenson, Derek Jeter, Samuel L. Jackson, and Dwayne Johnson are along for the film's gut-busting, powder-kegged ride. Eva Mendes plays a role of special merit and thus merits special mention as the object of Gamble's (lawful) affections and of Hoitz's (unholy but almost unstoppable) cravings.

I personally did not watch more as the first 5 minutes of this movie, I was prepared to like it, I was bitterly disappointed. Why can't they make car chases like in the best car chase movie, Ronin? Why does it all need to be unrealistic? What is wrong with some good old proper chases, proper shooting, proper science, not all this nonsense?

182,jaysilentbob37,Funniest movie of the year! What a surprise!,7,29 August 2010,"And I thought Will Ferrell's ship had sailed years ago. None of his movies since Anchorman have been much better than average, and his personality has since gotten quite old. I was blown away by this film on that level. Will Ferrell actually was funny. Though his usual style of humor was there, he never goes overboard with it, always staying true to his hysterical character. Even funnier is Mark Wahlberg, who actually manages to upstage Will Ferrell in the comedy department. His chemistry with Ferrell, his constant angry outbursts and thoroughly agitated personality result in some of the biggest laughs of the summer. Wahlberg might just have a career in comedy as a result of this.The plot is rather weak in many ways. Ferrell and Wahlberg play a couple of police desk drones who live in the shadow of two badass hero cops who the city worships (two of the funniest cameos ever... I won't spoil them). When an unfortunate accident occurs, frustrated tough guy Wahlberg convinces Ferrell to join him in trying to take their place. What follows is an endless stream of gags and one-liners, as well as a convoluted and somewhat unnecessary financial thriller subplot that tends to drag the film down when it's emphasized too much. But it's hard to find fault when a film makes me laugh like this one did.The Other Guys knows that its success relies on the quality of its jokes, and fully delivers. A running joke involves Ferrell, an effeminate dweeb, getting all the attractive women much to Wahlberg's dismay and confusion. Their take on how Hollywood portrays explosions is great, and we get a true sense of the god complex that seems to affect most movie cops (see the movie and you'll know what I mean). The jokes range fro brilliant, to not-so-brilliant but well-timed and executed, sometimes silly, sometimes downright bizarre, and sometimes lost among the laughter. It would take a second viewing to catch everything, because this is truly one film where you WILL miss lines from laughing. The storyline is flimsy and the action sequences are poor, but that's just the film snob in me talking. I see comedies to laugh, and when it works, it works. The Other Guys is the funniest film to come out this year. 7/10.",The Other Guys

186,jack_pearson,tied for best comedy ever made,10,12 February 2021,"This and tropic thunder are the best two comedies ever made in my opinion. the other guys is so clever and self aware, it's hilarious at every point. most of the comedy is fleshed out through dialogue which is why i think it has a low rating",The Other Guys
187,sdebeaubien,"Funny, but...",5,2 November 2010,"I don't know. Maybe I just don't get it. I don't get spoofs I guess. Airplane was funny too, but, seriously, can you rate a movie higher than a 5/10 just for being more than funny? This one I can't. Maybe it's just Will Ferrell. Honestly, Mark Wahlberg in a comedy? Maybe I don't get that either. Samuel L. Jackson and The Rock looked like they were just having fun, who wouldn't doing that kind of a bit? There's some kinds of comedy that deserve more than a 5/10 rating, but I guess they just aren't spoofs in my book. Cop shows are what I live for. I've been addicted to L&O SVU for the past 10 years I think, and I used to like the regular L&O stuff sometimes. CSI shows are OK too. Heck, I've watched cop spoofs before, and I've seen spy spoofs, going back all the way to Get Smart (does that date me?), some of it's good, some is OK. I didn't find much redeeming about this movie, just funny is all.",The Other Guys
188,Apemangalore,"Starts off strong, but loses its steam in the latter half",5,6 August 2010,"From Anchorman to Talladega Nights, the duo of Will Ferrell and director Adam McKay has become one of my favorites – comically – in the industry as of late. And based on the trailer for The Other Guys, the quirky spirit of those two films in particular seemed to be relatively intact, but does it hold up over the course of the entire film? Unfortunately, no.To start off with aspects of this film that I enjoyed, virtually every cast member involved does a solid job in their respective roles. Both Will Ferrell and Mark Wahlberg play off of each other much better than you might expect as the titular characters, and Michael Keaton – once again, this summer – steals just about every scene that he's in as the Guys' more-calm-than-he-probably-should-be captain. Also, for what little screen time that they have, both Sam Jackson and Dwayne ""The Rock"" Johnson shine as the two celebrity-status-garnered cops, being responsible for what could be the funniest movie moment of this year so far. Even Eva Mendes (who I'm typically not the biggest fan of) shares a couple of enjoyable moments with Ferrell as his purposely-out-of-his-league wife.It's unfortunate, then, that the plot of The Other Guys is an absolute mess. After about the first forty-five minutes, the movie begins to shovel in unnecessary parts of the story, and by the time that the climax hit, there was simply too much going on for me to even care (despite some surprisingly well-shot action sequences). Also, don't confuse this with last month's Inception, whose complicated narrative was used to challenge the viewer.Still, though, I'm a firm believer in that, no matter how much I may not like the plot of a comedy, if it makes me laugh, it's done its job. A similar rule goes for horror films in my book, where the primary goal should just be to frighten me. Even in this area, The Other Guys only succeeds during its initial half. Similarly to Knight and Day from earlier this summer, once the second half rolls around, most of the appeal is lost, and the movie becomes more of a financial thriller than a buddy-cop comedy.The Other Guys, while still enjoyable to a degree, with the laughs being nearly consistent throughout the first forty-five minutes, is yet another film from this summer in which a significant chunk of its steam is lost within the latter half. Overall, my suggestion would be to pay half of the ticket price to see half of the film. Doesn't sound too unreasonable, does it?",The Other Guys
189,jbloch-72953,Could be the worst ever,1,18 February 2020,"When Samuel L Jackson and Dwayne Johnson jumped off a seven story roof to their deaths I now know why. They wanted to disassociate themselves from this movie as soon as possible. This flick makes the Forty Year Old Virgin look like a masterpiece.
Nothing more than a string of unfunny lines with nothing to tie them together. A true waste of talent.
Should have known with Will Farrell in it the only performance he ever did that was truly funny was in the Wedding Crashers. This movie has a promising cast and delivers less than nothing. Totally insufferable!",The Other Guys

I did not expect anything to come from this film because of the fact that Will Ferell had lost his touch in film for a while. With his streak of terrible movies I thought the streak would continue. This movie was more funny than Dinner for Schmucks, Step Brothers, but not as funny as the Hangover or Hot Tub Time Machine.I was particularly happy for two reasons one, my favorite wrestler of all time is Dwayne Johnson, and that they used the song ""My Hero"" by the Foo Fighters, those were just two little kicks for me.Not going to spoil the movie but basically Terry Hoitz (Mark Wahlberg) and Alan Gamble (Will Ferell) are detectives who hate each other, but through out the film they learn to co-exist.

I can think of only one movie he has made I didn't care much for. When I compare Farrel to Carey there is none. Farrel is simply light years ahead of him and it must be because he writes his own material. An exceptionally talented bloke indeed.I noticed that some reviewers even though they rate the film say its to long...Eh? Please give me another hour. Do these people have such short attention spans? Wahlberg really surprised me in this as his comedic timing was spot on. His looks of incredulous amazement at Farrels antics were often priceless. I simply didn't see the guys as a comedy actor but he absolutely shone in this paired up with Farrel.Wahlberg and Farrel must have got on very well as the chemistry between the two is obvious and adds greatly to the enjoyment of the movie for the viewer.I rarely ask for a sequel, but please do make another one with the same cast and while your at it add on another hour.Pure comedy magic!",The Other Guys

197,jusco15,jusco's review: The Other Guys,7,24 December 2010,"I don't watch a lot of comedies. This isn't because I dislike the genre; no, it's quite the contrary, but the problem is that the number of bad comedies easily outnumber the number of good ones. A good comedy must be well-written, well-timed, well-acted and well-delivered (refer to: Little Miss Sunshine and Hot Fuzz). So I was extremely and pleasantly surprised at how funny The Other Guys was. I deliberately skipped it in cinemas but since it was the one film on the airplane I still hadn't seen, I gave it a try and found myself laughing from start to finish.The plot: two police officers, Detective Allen and Detective Terry, are the losers and laughing stock of their colleagues. Receiving no respect from the other officers, they are left dealing with paperwork. But when they stumble upon an opportunity to prove their worth, 'the other guys' step up to the challenge to show that they can actually accomplish something.Two things stood out.First, Will Ferrell's performance. I have to admit I hadn't seen very many of Will Ferrell's films, but I got a glimpse of his brilliant acting in Stranger Than Fiction, one of his few serious roles which he executed superbly. He does it again in this film. I now see why he's labeled as one of the leading comic actors around (though I'd have to watch his other films to be able to confidently state that fact). Mark Wahlberg's performance was refreshing as well, though he wasn't up to Will Ferrell's standard.But what was undeniably holding the film together was the script – a round of applause for Chris Henchy and Adam McKay, the scriptwriters. The dialogue was pure comedy and solidly written. It's not rare to happen upon a comedy that runs entirely on one-liners and bursts of short comical scenes, but it's rare for it to work. Since when does an argument involving tunas devouring lions on land by constructing breathing apparatuses with kelp become so hilarious? If you get a chance, watch it. I guarantee you'll be laughing your head off.",The Other Guys
198,shroyertour,Good - would watch it again sometime.,6,2 November 2010,"Is there a recent movie that does not feature Samuel L. Jackson?Probably, but this movie stars the unlikely combination of Will Ferrell and Mark Wahlberg as two poorly matched big city police detectives who do the paperwork and leave the heroism to others (Jackson and Dwayne ""The Rock"" Johnson). Wahlberg may be an action star but this movie is dominated by Ferrell's usual comedy/spoof genre. Just as there is only a little action for Wahlberg, there is only some of Ferrell's usual style of humor.Ferrell and Wahlberg play two cops who have little in common. Nevertheless, the Ferrell/Wahlberg partnership works well to produce a better than average action/comedy/police film. As if to emphasize the nature of this flick, Michael Keaton stars as the police captain who moonlights at Bed Bath and Beyond.If you want to see Wahlberg in an action movie, check out Shooter or Max Payne. If you want to see Ferrell doing his stuff then watch Anchorman: The Legend of Ron Burgundy. Those movies are examples of each of these two stars at their best. This movie shows them both running in 2nd gear, still pretty good I think.This movie is good enough to watch now and again sometime.",The Other Guys

The comedy is minimal and some of it is even not funny. The problem is just that we expect more when it comes to such a star cast and an amazing guest appearance by Samuel Jackson and Dwayne Johnson.If you're looking to find a simple flick to pass your time. This might be the right choice, however if you want some serious comedy.. skip it.Only watch this when you know you don't have anything better to watch, or you just might end up regretting..",The Other Guys
200,Cs_The_Moment,Surprisingly Humorous Stereotypical Cop Parody,6,16 March 2014,"The Other Guys is a stereotype of its parody-cop-film genre, but before you write it off completely, it bites back with some genuine humour. As is to be expected, it is full of silly moments and unbelievable clichés, but there were also a surprising number of laugh out loud moments. Will Ferrell and Mark Wahlberg play two unconventional detectives who are paired up after both facing disgrace and ending up with a police desk job. They jump in on a case and end up with a lot more than they bargained for, predictably causing mayhem along the way.The characters portrayed by Ferrell and Wahlberg are not a far cry from their usual typecasts: Ferrell is the geeky oddball and Wahlberg is the ""tough-guy-jerk"", and there are similarly stereotypical roles played by supporting actors such as Eva Mendes and Steve Coogan. Initially this is off-putting, but once you get into the film this becomes less cringey, however I would definitely suggest giving this film a miss if you aren't a fan of both Ferrell and Wahlberg. In typical parody-cop- film style, the film is full of predictable situations topped off with outrageous stunts and cheesy one-liners, however the stunts are fairly impressive and some of these lines provide unexpected laughs. Several of Ferrell's lines felt like a nod to his character of Ron Burgundy in Anchorman (2004), although his nerdy cop role in this is a far cry from the hilarious news anchor. The relationship between Ferrell and Wahlberg may start off ridiculous, but ends up being quite an enjoyable pairing. It doesn't present anything new or ground-breaking to the genre, but I didn't really expect anything different.Strangely enjoyable despite being one huge stereotype, this film is unexpectedly entertaining if you're in the mood for some lowbrow humour and cliché. Expect cheap laughs and crazy car chases aplenty.",The Other Guys
201,heisenberg83,Weakest Ferrell yet I'm afraid.,3,5 October 2010,"I am a big Will Ferrell fan - I loved Anchorman, Blades of Glory, and to some extent Step Brothers. But this was REALLY poor. Will seemed to only be on 25% thrusters here, and even seemed to play the straight man to Wahlberg most of the film which was odd. Even Steve Coogan (Alan Partridge) is completely wasted. There are 3-4 funny moments (classic Ferrell outbursts) but it is a truly lame duck. By the end I was so bored and couldn't wait for it to finish. It is wrapped in some sort of semi- serious plot about financial crime which is overly-complex and pointless - who cares?! I never understand comedies that try to put in serious plot lines as if the audience will care.AVOID!",The Other Guys
202,craigdoolan,"Really good script, could have been handled better",7,10 January 2021,"Generally a well-scripted and funny film. It starts especially well with some terrific scenes with Samuel L Jackson and Dwayne Johnson, but doesn't quite sustain it through the film, although the action scenes remain strong.A good script really helps and this one is quite clever and, by themselves, Mark Wahlberg and Will Ferrell both do it well. For some reason though, they just don't seem to work that well together, I couldn't quite put my finger on why it didn't seem to work, but if often didn't. Michael Keaton's character also doesn't quite seem to work, although there are funny elements to it.While the action scenes were really well done, some of the other scenes are poorly shot and edited and once I noticed it, it really started to bother me. I suspect that in better hands, this could have been a much better film. Overall a good film and worth a watch at least once.",The Other Guys
203,Fangor,How not to write comedy,3,18 December 2010,"First off Ferrel is a hit or miss actor, he can be excellent or just stupid, so I guess I mostly blame Adam McKay for this poor execution. And Wahlberg should just stay away from comedy.When writing comedy for film there are two things you do not do. You do not explain the joke and you do not telegraph the joke. Doing this will spoil the joke. If you are a professional writer you should know this. These basic concepts are constantly broken with each and every joke in this movie. It's over the top, but in a bad way. All I could hear was ""This is a joke. We are being funny. Please laugh when the sign that says 'Laugh Now' lights up.""When you are pointing out the fact that you are trying to be funny. You are insulting the intelligence of the audience. Let the watcher decide if your joke is funny or not.""This was a smart idea..."" Yes, we got the pun already. ha. ha. If I think the joke was bad or did not get it, let it pass. I might find the next joke funny. Don't hit me over the head with it. The movie also has the bad taste to beat dead horses. Jokes that where mildly amusing at best the first time around where repeated, often several times. The second time you know it's going to be a running joke and the third and so on,then it's just painful. Comedy is supposed to be spontaneous, take you off guard and if it's also witty, then it really hits home. This movie does neither.What really boggles me though is after sitting through this movie, getting increasingly bored by it at a steady pace. It ends with a political statement. After the movie goes out of it's way to make sure I can't take it seriously, even as a comedy. It then has the audacity to try and make a point. By then I couldn't care less about anything coming from this movie. It had already lost my attention.I have only two possible explanations for this movie. Either it was written by an amateur, or the entire movie is a scriptwriters inside joke. Realizing this is the writer/director behind stepbrothers, which was stupid, but at the same time undeniably hilarious. I know he can do better, so I have to conclude it's a stumbling attempt at the later.**Minor spoiler** It was clear already from the two super-cops that the movie tries to poke fun at the genre, but it really got to me with the explosion scene. It's so overplayed and the point is so painfully obvious that it simply does not work. Everyone knows (ok a few people might not, IE. children) that Hollywood physics are laughable. It's one thing to spoof that, but it's another to drag on about it. You are undoing the punchline of your own joke. And don't get me started on the final shootout scene, it's not even worth bothering with. **End spoiler**",The Other Guys
204,nukfan,Disappointing,4,30 December 2010,"I'll start off by saying that I am a fan of Will Ferrel's movies. I liked Elf, Stepbrothers, Anchorman, Talledega Nights and his SNL skits. But The Other Guys, in my opinion, was, simply put, a bad, unfunny film.I really tried to like this movie. I tried to find the laugh-out-loud humour that I saw in Stepbros and Anchorman, but it simply wasn't there. Maybe I should watch it again (IN CASE I DO, CONSIDER THIS MY FIRST OPINION). The movie got off to a promising start, with Samuel L. Jackson and Dwayne Johnson making me laugh in every scene that they were in. And Ferrel's naive character along with Wahlberg's insecure character gave me high hopes. But, as the film progressed, it was painfully clear that they were always mere inches away from a great punchline, but you soon realized that they had already said the punchline, and the ""funny"" joke was finished. However, the acting was good; there were no poor performances. It's just that their dialogue was unfunny.I'll sum it up like this: if you've seen the trailers, you've seen the funny parts. End of story.",The Other Guys

Don't get me wrong I laughed out loud at times, but it wasn't a memorable experience.I think I would have liked this movie a lot more when I was 12, but for any adult, it was kinda boring.

Some where you literally laugh out loud even when you watch it at home on blu ray.Michael Keatons return to the big screen was also a delight. His role as Police Chief really fit him well. It was also really funny the way Ferrell treated Mendes were extremely funny. He played it as she was an ugly housewife with nothing to contribute. Director McKay held it together perfectly.

210,stewartmatt99,Finally a good comedy!,8,10 September 2010,"Police Detectives P.K. Highsmith (Samuel L. Jackson) and Christopher Danson (Dwayne Johnson) are the heroes of the NYPD, and are loved by the entire city. Detective Allen Gamble (Will Ferrell) and Terry Hoitz (Mark Wahlberg) are the ""Other Guys"" of the the Police Department. However, when these two men happen to come across a case that no one else wants, their lives may be changed forever, and they may become the new heroes of New York City.Let us take a quick look at some of the comedies that have tortured us this past summer. Grown Ups, Shrek Forever After, Knight and Day (brought a few laughs, but nothing special), and Date Night, which was actually a pretty good film, but not enough to save a summer as bad as this past one. There are a lot more comedies that really just were not very good, but I don't think there is any reason to go into detail about what everyone already knows. Needless to say, The Other Guys saved the summer as far as comedies go! It may not have been the best comedy ever, but what it did that other comedies this summer failed to do, is consistently make me laugh throughout the entire film, which for the most part is all anyone could ask for.The key to the comedy in this film was both Will Ferrell and Mark Wahlberg. Their acting was nearly perfect, and along with a fantastic screenplay they really made The Other Guys a movie that is worth seeing, and actually buying as well as that. I don't usually picture Mark Wahlberg as a person for comedy, so if you are thinking that, do not let it stop you from seeing this movie, he was excellent. Also, I think Michael Keaton deserves a little bit of recognition for his role. He was absolutely hilarious at certain times of the film. There really is not too much to say about Ferrell. He is a good actor and he is funny, I think we all know that by now. I liked the appearance by Samuel L. Jackson and Dwayne Johnson as well. All in all, the acting was very well done by all actors.Here I will have to disagree with Rotten Tomatoes, this was in my opinion the best collaboration between Will Ferrell and Adam Mckay. This was Adam Mckay's best film for me. He did a good job with the direction, and his screenplay was brilliant. So you take an actor like Will Ferrell and a screenplay like this and you come out with an excellent comedy, especially for a summer such as this past one.Overall, The Other Guys was a very good film, and was funny all through the movie, which nowadays just doesn't seem to happen too often. Adam Mckay did a good job with the screenplay and direction, I really enjoyed this film.",The Other Guys
211,RokurotaMakabe,"Overall, an enjoyable movie",6,10 July 2011,"""The Other Guys"" is a film that perhaps works better as a whole than as a comedy or action flick. It stars Mark Wahlberg and Will Ferrell as two cops with totally different styles who try to climb their way up the police rankings. When an opportunity to make themselves noticed arrives, the two will have to set their differences aside and collaborate in order to solve the new case.This film brings nothing new in terms of comedy, but there are surely moments that will make you laugh. The problem is that these moments alternate with some where the story simply stagnates, moments that are not particularly funny. I had the impression that the director envisioned the film in two totally different ways and not knowing which one was better, he decided to mix them together. ""The Other Guys"" is also an action movie and the action scenes are pretty well made for this kind of film. It is silly, but that's the way it was meant to be and from this perspective the film reaches its objective. Also, when you put the comedy and the action in the balance you will find that the result is actually satisfying. Wahlberg and Ferrell make an OK couple here, their chemistry is not great, but you can't blame them for not trying. As for the other actors, I liked Michael Keaton's role (he is such an underrated actor) and thought that Steve Coogan was good in his part as well.Despite not being that funny, ""The Other Guys"" compensates with its good action scenes and above average acting. While it feels that the result could have been better, this is a quite entertaining flick and it is still worth a look.My rating: 6/10",The Other Guys
212,cesarbau,More fun moments than five comedies combined,10,29 October 2010,"The Other Guys"" is a fireball of hilarity detonated by two writers who seem to be having as much fun as its weird heroes. It begs the question: why can't the funniest movie of the year be its best as well? Just about the only big gripe about it is the slacking off of the laughs in the second half, but by then the audience have had more fun moments than five comedies combined. Besides, the story fulfills a higher purpose: to send a poison letter to Wall Street and its regulators. Both halves are good honest entertainment. If there's one movie that could have shed light on recent U.S. financial scandals, it's ""Wall Street: Money Never Sleeps."" But Oliver Stone barely scratches their surface, while ""The Other Guys"" exposes them with startling clarity, from the collusions to cover up the losses of investment banks and a buddy system that binds the regulators and the regulated. This movie pits powerful cliques of buddies against the underdog buddies, two losers in the police force.The bond between Detectives Allen Gamble and Terry Hoitz (Will Ferrell and Mark Wahlberg) is a tongue-in-cheek teaming up of meatheads. Gamble, the more finely done character, ""audited"" his parents when he was 11. He became a pimp in school, sporting rapper chic, and later switched to the job of a detective accountant, taunted by colleagues as their ""paper bitch."" As a buddy, he's fiercely loyal and thoughtful. As a husband, he can be verbally abusive. But as a sex object, he is a runaway hit, driving hot women into a state and into fantasies of three-day sex marathons.Hoitz has had less success in his love life despite being the movie-star/model type. As a young man, he learned to dance the ballet and play the harp as an act of ""sarcasm"" toward sissies whom he wanted to beat up. Currently, he's banned from street beats because he had brought shame to the police when he shot the top star of the World Series. As a buddy, he can be dense, hurting Gamble's delicate feelings and using him cynically in the name of police duty. Teaming up Ferrell and Wahlberg was an inspired move. They're both born comic actors, capable of wild physical gags as well as a more subtle type of mimicry. Ferrell has the more demanding role, where he swings from being a reluctant partner to a gung-ho crime-buster and as a gruff husband to Dr. Sheila Gamble (Eva Mendez). But Wahlberg is as expressive (""I'm a peacock, you've gotta let me fly!"") and as multi-layered, such as his look of disbelief and lust when he first meets Sheila. Like the comic greats, the duo gives Gamble and Hoitz a kind face, a gentle disposition and an honest heart. Directed by Adam McKay like an indulgent father giving free rein to his gifted children, and scripted by himself and Chris Henchy, ""The Other Guys"" has supplied this year's most quoted lines. Early on, the duo has a battle of conceits to express how they dislike each other. ""If I were a lion and you were a tuna,"" says Hoitz, ""I'd swim to the middle of the ocean and eat you and I'd bang your tuna girlfriend,"" whereupon Gamble frees a cascade of metaphors.More word plays keep the fun going (""the sound of your pee hitting the urinal sounds feminine""), as well as non sequiturs (""I'm Catholic, he's Episcopalian, so somehow it works"") and mock hyperbole (""I think we all witnessed today a ballet of emotions and feelings,"" says Gamble of Hoitz's Baryshnikov-like pirouettes). This movie puts the audience in such a lighthearted state that when it's time to wrap up the story, some feeling of letdown sets in. But sit tight, as there's intrigue and more wham-bang action yet to come. When Gamble and Hoitz set off to investigate scaffolding violations in the buildings owned by billionaire David Ershon (Steve Coogan), little did they know that they will be sitting on top of a rotten scheme where Ershon and his creditors conspire to make huge dirty profits from huge dirty losses. Some may find the Wall Street jargon off-putting, but really, it all boils down to state lottery earnings and police officers' pensions at risk of melting down. American public apathy had played a role in the Bernie Madoff, Bear Stearns and Lehman Brothers scandals, and still does and this movie indicts everyone.Two scenes keep ""The Other Guys"" crackling with comic madness. The comedy gems are the dinner scene at the Gambles with Mendez and a sketch toward the end -- where Gamble's mother-in-law (Viola Harris), disguised as a bag lady with a walker, shuttles back and forth to deliver increasingly salacious messages between him and his angry wife.In a Manhattan pub, Jewish humor meets Irish humor as Gamble (or Irish-blooded Ferrell) joins an a cappella group in a lovely rendition of a parody of a tragic Irish rebel song that ends with the English scoundrels burning Harry Potter books. Huh? Coogan plays Ershon as a quick-witted manipulator with the charm of a fading rock-star. Mendez as Gamble's trophy wife reveals a comedic side to her celebrated silhouette and is very much in on the joke. But Madame Harris steals the show at the last moment as her pleading eyes and quivering voice, tinged with gleeful malice, turn the audience's giggles into bursts of laughter.In one defining moment, Gamble and Hoitz duck under the bed to make sure that their chat is not being recorded. ""Did you miss me?"" Gamble flusters. Hoitz continues his prattle about the latest findings of their criminal investigation. ""Hey did you miss me?"" Gamble insists. ""Well ahhh, umm yes,"" Hoitz replies, then carries on. It's a splendid irony that after all the huffing and the arguing and the screaming, the best lines of ""The Other Guys"" come in whispers.",The Other Guys

This is a Will Ferrell Masterclass,9,10 March 2019,"Undenialbely some of it is silly humour, but Will Ferrell out-does himself playing a nerdy but professional, unwitting police officer.The irony of his role is well place and not overdone. Supposedly a serious cop but with an unreletting sense of aparent ignorance. His wife is played by an incredible actress in Eva Mendes, but Will is impecable in his role of playing her down even though she is not only incredibely gorgeous but playing the epitome of the perfect wife.Mark wahlberg excels as Ferrel's police partner who is dumfounded by his partners lack of awarness, whilst trying to stear him in the direction of the goals they seek to achieve, whilst amusingly flirting with Ferrel's characters wife.",The Other Guys
214,airguitar57,The summer comedy is back and with explosions,8,10 August 2010,"Few films this summer have made me want to rush to the theaters. Is it a sign of a struggling cinematic climate, a recession plagued studio system or just a weak summer? Without taking the time to figure out the specific reason let's just agree that there isn't much to get excited about this summer, especially in the comedy genre. Luckily, we live in a world where Will Ferrell and Adam McKay get to make films. The Other Guys stands as a sign that when it comes to ridiculous comedy, this duo continues to set the standard.Highsmith (Samuel L. Jackson) and Danson (Dwayne Johnson) are the definition of action hero cops. Allen Gamble (Will Ferrell) and Terry Hoitz (Mark Wahlberg) are not. Gamble is a forensic accountant with no aspirations to leave his desk. His partner, Hoitz, having been shackled to his desk after an incident that involved a discharged weapon and a New York Yankee cannot wait to get back in the field. So, when there is an opening for the new hotshot cops, Hoitz jumps at the opportunity. As the two attempt to prove that they are more than just desk jockeys, they stumble upon quite the case that goes deeper than they could have imagined.First, let's get the film's missteps out of the way. The acting isn't always the best, and I'm looking at you Mark Wahlberg. Some people may say that I'm expecting too much and that this is just Marky Mark and we should be happy that he is able to survive without the Funky Bunch, but I say nay. I have witnessed Mr. Wahlberg put his best foot forward in the acting realm. I only have to go back to The Departed where he knocked it out of the park and got a well-deserved Academy Award nomination to see just how good he can be. While his acting is much better than it was in The Happening (although I don't think anything could be worse than that) it often seemed like he wasn't trying. The story is a bit unoriginal and formulaic. The credits, which some may not consider part of the film, takes an odd political turn. While the animation is all right and the information is interesting, the material seems out of place and left me confused when I would have rather left smiling. The only other caveat I would have for this film is that it is very much a Ferrell/McKay film. This is the team that brought us Anchorman and Step Brothers and this film is in that same vein. If you don't like their style of comedy, you probably won't be a huge fan of The Other Guys.Moving on to the good stuff. The cast is strong. Ferrell hits it out of the park. He manages to balance moments of insanity with the ability to also act as a straight man. I don't know that there is another actor that can create a character that is able to bounce across this line as well as Ferrell. Dwayne Johnson (it's tough not to say ""The Rock"") and Samuel L. Jackson play characters that we've seen before, but don't fail to delight. Then there is Eva Mendes. Obviously, she is all types of beautiful, but the girl has got some comedy chops. I loved the pairing of her and Ferrell and I never doubted that her character had all sorts of love for Ferrell's creating a relationship that is simultaneously sweet and crazy. While the cast is able to elicit huge laughs, without a great script they would have nothing. The script seems to be written to make sure that nearly every line will get some kind of laugh, be it a chuckle or a chortle. The film demands at least a second viewing since I was laughing so hard that I'm sure I missed some jokes.As I've said before, The Other Guys is first and foremost a comedy, but it holds its own when it comes to action. At first I was surprised how well put together all of the action set pieces were. After all, this is Adam McKay not Michael Bay. It was only after I sat and thought about it that I realized that McKay has been building to an all out action film. There was the multiple news station brawl in Anchorman, then the NASCAR crash in Talladega Nights, and most recently the end credit schoolyard smack down in Step Brothers. After this mini retrospective, I realized that I shouldn't be surprised that the guy handles explosions impressively since he's been eyeing it for so long. In this comedy, the well-choreographed and entertaining action is a sweet bonus treat.The summer comedy is back. With The Other Guys Ferrell and McKay show how to make a funny film. The story is far from original and occasionally formulaic, but this doesn't stop the film from being all kinds of entertaining. The script is so well written that any cast would be able to get some laughs from it and it is the audience's good fortune that such funny lines get to be delivered by this cast. Although Wahlberg's acting is a bit wooden, he works well with Ferrell. Eva Mendes, as Ferrell's wife, is surprising in just how well she works in this comedy. Even the narration is great, delivered with the steely coolness that is Ice-T. On top of being a laugh riot, McKay is able to put together some great action scenes, allowing the film to stay true to its buddy cop roots. Despite a confusing and oddly political end sequence, the film will make you laugh. It may be too early to call it, but I'm going to anyway, The Other Guys is the funniest film of this summer.",The Other Guys
215,MovieChamp,Well... It has its moments. Will Ferrell is in it to. That's it!,6,12 August 2010,"What can I say? It is a comedy and is humerus a bit. Pretty standard for a comedy flick now a days. I do have to say it starts off well enough but never really escalates to anything. Actually the movie sort of just drags out, then ends.Well... It has its moments. Will Ferrell is in it to. That's it! They have a cash grab and will indeed make some money on this film. Not an awful comedy by any means but man, this is a big budget comedy. With big stars and one of the best and well known comedians in the lead role. You think you should be rolling out of your set or have some touch of comedic wit.In the end after thinking about the film for a while. I can not condone watching it. I certainly don't recommend in theaters. Maybe a rental or even better a TV viewing would be best. If you miss it all together no problem. All you missed was something like a 1 hour and 40 min Saturday Night Live skit, that's only OK. Not even good. Final score for me. 6.3/10",The Other Guys

This movie starts with a bang. Samuel L. Jackson and The Rock are two cocky cool guy cops that are driving a muscle car and caught up in a ridiculous over the top chase that's hilarious! There's lots of great one-liners and tension between Ferrell and Wahlberg in the first half.But in the second half the movie takes a nose dive into the earth's core. I honestly felt like a 10 year old was editing and directing then! There are occasional hints in the first half that it will fail like excessive goofiness and dragged sequences.

I like some of Will Ferrell's stuff and most of Mark Wahlberg's. I went into this film with the excitement of seeing a very funny movie. This has got to be one of the dumbest comedies that I have seen in quite awhile. I laughed MAYBE 4 times throughout this whole dog of a movie. The acting sucked and was forced. The chemistry was non-existent between Will and Mark. The whole movie was so unbelievable and juvenile that you would either have to be drunk, stoned or under 16 years old to think that this film was funny in any way shape or form. I bet that the Rock and Samuel Jackson were grateful that they only had small parts in this movie and were out of it after the first 15 minutes or so. I would have been happy if I were them too, when the script read for them to jump off of a building together and basically commit suicide. They got off lucky by being killed off as soon as they were. I'm just kind of surprised that they didn't survive the jump, seeing as how unbelievably stupid that the rest of this movie was. Do yourselves a favor and pass this dog up.",The Other Guys
219,swarthylad,AWESOME Comedy & a Definite Will Ferrell BEST!,8,6 August 2010,"This movie delivered just as promised... an amazing performance by Will Ferrell. The whole plot of have pants dropping Mark Wahlberg and Will Farrell as a police investigator team screams funny. There is not only great chemistry between the two, but you could tell they were just having a blast doing this movie. In addition, the starting police stars played by Samuel Jackson and Dwayne Johnson really started out the movie in an amazing chase scene which was not only dramatic but amazingly funny. The whole thing with them jumping to their deaths ""in the line of duty"" rather than let the bad guys get away was just one example of the dark comedy which this movie delivers a number of times throughout. I also would mention that Michael Keaton delivered a great performance of a quirky police chief...very quirky... using TLC music quotes as inspiration to the officers was just amazingly funny. Even the ending credits delivering a ""political/non-political"" message about financial bailouts was a bit different from what your normally see out of Hollywood... not really a blame of any political party but really just a demonstration of corporate greed. All in all this movie was I think Ferrell's best to date and am happy to see a comedy that actually kept not only myself... but the entire audience laughing throughout.

224,lisa-629,Great Movie for Everyone!,9,7 August 2010,"Everyone that is in this movie is fantastic. Writer/Director Adam McKay brings in a hot topic story line that carries this film right through to the end. The film starts out with Ferrell and Wahlberg being an odd ball duo, with Ferrell happy behind a desk and Wahlberg aching for some action. Wahlberg is able to finally convince Ferrell to jump on a case with him, which leads them to an investigation that is ill advised all along the way. Mendes lights up the film as Ferrells mismatched wife, with Wahlberg immediately noting this and stating it constantly throughout the film. The movie is full of action, as well as great chemistry between Ferrell and Wahlberg, which leads to hilarious interactions between them. I recommend this film for everyone!!!",The Other Guys

I won't spoil it here but you have to see it. The Ferrell/Wahlberg matching is not among the screen's most inspired pairings. The two lack chemistry, and Wahlberg's capabilities as the ""straight man"" are dubious (although his reaction to the choice of the Little River Band as ""psych music"" is priceless). Aside from his recent supporting role in Date Night, Wahlberg hasn't done much comedy, concentrating his performances in the thriller and/or drama arena, and the lack of experience occasionally shows in The Other Guys. Nevertheless, the responsibility for being funny rests on the shoulders of Ferrell and, for the first time in several years, he is up to the task (with more than a little help from Jackson and Johnson). This is a fun film- one of the funnier ones Will Ferrell has done in years.",The Other Guys

227,Skriptman,When Improv Goes Bad,1,7 August 2010,"I think I'm being kind calling this overblown, half-conceived offering the biggest piece of celluloid turd I've seen in a while. It probably started off as a half-decent idea, but instead of hiring a writer, the director decided he'd credit himself as writer and ""create"" the movie on the fly. And that's exactly what he got. A collage of half-worked scenes - admittedly with one or two laughs along the way, but that's about it - and two hours of laborious ""comedy"". There's one (long) riff between Will Ferrell and Mark Walhberg - an ultra-lame bit about lions and tunas (yeah, I know. And it's about that funny, too) that goes on so long it's actually painful to watch. I like Will Ferrell. He's good at sketch comedy... short pieces that don't have to have a clear beginning, middle and end. But linking a thousand sketches together to make a film just doesn't cut it.I will offer kudos to Mark Walhberg. Despite the temptation to play it for laughs,(a temptation irresistible to most of the other actors), Walhberg plays his role straight and honest and provides the only few genuine comedic moments in the film. The cameos by the half dozen or so name actors can't rescue the tired storyline... rather, you get the feeling they're all saying, hey, look at us! We're being really funny, right? ...Sorry. No.",The Other Guys

And not to be to black and white about how a movie is. As always you can find things you dislike about a movie. Then you weight that out to the good things and then come to a nice average point to give to the movie.Humor is a very hard emotion to please everybody with. Some ppl love the hard cussing in movies (Samuel L Jackson trademark) And some love the high intellect humor of say a John Cleese or a Rowan Atkison that are able to give you a smile from ear to ear without even speech.The thing is when i started up the movie, you see Dwayne Johnson,who i really love as a actor! Really a great asset to the cinema. And Samuel L Jackson (the man is a old granddad and still going strong) i was like THIS WIL BE GREAT! Samuel the great Go beep yourself personality, and The rock as a duo perfect fit. Now i was not expecting a Danny glover and Mel Gibson chemistry (Lethal weapon 1 to infinity) But it felt good.Sadly but true, the die pretty early and there replaced by a Will Ferrell, and a Mark wahlberg my mood degraded with the minute it is really bad.Mark was not able to play the ""angry"" cop, he came over to me as a annoying person with no real convincing skills to make me laugh. Samuel l Jackson that made in his 15min (CAMEO i call it) with the rock 2 sentences that made me laugh like hell.1st beginning when he lands his car in the city bus ""Uhh did someone call 91 holy sh*t!"" 2nd When he tells Will Ferrell to shut up ""Ai aij! you shut your mouth, if i want to hear you talk, i put my hand up your *ss and work you like a puppet"" I can assure you, the rest of the movie is utterly boring. There is no chemistry between Ferrell and Mark at all. The don't fit as a team up the have a lousy sense of humor. Will is as usual LOUD very loud..I wanted to turn it off after the TUNA story (trust you even for fans its a idiotic scene that made no sense and its supposed to be funny).

They remain mainly at their desks doing paperwork, something almost never seen in movies. Ferrell is Allen Gamble, who is somewhat content with managing case work on his computer, and Wahlberg is the far more forceful and ambitious Terry Hoitz.Their characters are in sharp contrast to the cops that Samuel L. Jackson and Dwayne Johnson portray in this film (and definitely in other films). Although Jackson and Johnson were also funny here, I hate that the previews gave away their cameos in this movie. It would have been more exciting if the audience didn't expect them when they stepped into the theaters. Then again, that is the fault of whomever marketed this film, not the filmmakers themselves.When Allen and Terry start working on a case they have a lead in, one they get to before other senior detectives do, a really interesting detective story progresses that would not feel out of place in dramas like ""The French Connection"" (1971) or similar action/detective movies to that nature.",The Other Guys

Wahlberg is the perfect straight-man, but also offers his own humor, in a tough-guy kind of way. (""They took my shoes again! What is it with taking peoples' shoes?"") Michael Keaton as the police chief is a perfect choice. He is funny enough that this isn't really a 'Will Ferrel' comedy, it really is a total group effort.

It is not the kind of movie where you'll be laughing the whole way through (which is not a bad thing), but it tends to catch you off guard.There are only a couple classic Will Ferrell parts in this movie, which is refreshing. He is a comic genius to have lasted this long as a comedic actor where people tend tire of them very quickly. This is probably one of Will Ferrell's best roles because his natural talent for the hilarious really fits well with the character whom is paradoxically funny (there's a new term to think about... when you see the movie anyways). He was great, and that's all fine and well but he was no match for the, ""Batman,"" in this movie.By, ""Batman,"" I mean Michael Keaton. I was laughing hard enough watching the movie, and continued to laugh about his character long after I had gotten home from the theatre. I had actually heard him say to David Letterman that he got his start in show business as a stand-up comedian, and that really shows in this movie. Fantastic work, Mr. Keaton! Mark Wahlberg played his character perfectly. That man has so much acting talent. He showed that he is able and willing to do comedic roles as well as dramatic ones. This movie was ideal for him to get his feet wet, as his character was very similar to a lot of his previous characters; only incidentally funny and purposefully exaggerated.Kudos to Adam Mckay and Chris Henchy. Their writing really made the movie, for me. The characters were so funny on their own, that it's hard to imagine any of these actors not be funny while playing them. I suspect the characters were actually tailored to the stars as Adam Mckay is apparently a very close friend of Will Ferrell's, and possibly the other actors in the movie as well. The cop-fight scene was incredible (being vague to avoid spoilers). I'm still laughing about it two days after seeing it.I recommend you see this movie with friends, as with any comedy. There are a lot of good movies in theatres right now and this one is definitely in the top 3, in my opinion. I'm glad I saw it.",The Other Guys
243,davggsco,The Other Guys - A Wavy Davy Review,6,25 September 2010,"The Other Guys is a straightforward comedy with little freshness or flair, and only looks good in comparison with this years other buddy-cop movie, Cop Out.Samuel L. Jackson and Dwayne 'The Rock' Johnson play New York's top cops but the movie focuses on 'The Other Guys' - two desk-cops with differing ambitions - played by Will Ferrell (Anchorman) and Mark Wahlberg (Max Payne). The movie follows this mis-matched pair as they try to claim the glorious title of top-spot within the New York police department. The main problem with 'The Other Guys' is that the laughs do not come consistently enough. There are some very funny moments - for instance when Will Ferrell apologises for his lovely, stunning wife (Eva Mendes). It is only Ferrell who generates laughs, though, and Mark Wahlberg comes across as an annoying and angry man. Steve Coogan (Tropic Thunder) and Michael Keaton make appearances, but especially Coogan has some terribly unfunny lines which is a shame because he has a lot of comedic talent. The story is also too complicated for a cop-comedy film. It follows Steve Coogan's character who is somehow involved in a series of financial crimes, as well as a jewel heist. It is also worth mentioning that some of the scenes make you wonder, how did he know he would be there? Wahlberg just seems to turn up in similar places in New York to Ferrell for little or no reason, other than the fact that they both hang out in these places (unbeknownst to each other).Overall, there are a few scenes which are genuinely funny, but ultimately there are not enough to sustain the audience's interest. If you are looking for a very stupid comedy then you will get a few laughs, but more serious film-goers will not particularly enjoy this one.",The Other Guys
244,marplesj,Fantastic lead characters,8,20 September 2010,"Whoever teamed up Ferrell and Wahlberg deserves a large pat on the back first off, a great leading two who play off each other really well. To be honest all of the characters were pretty damn good, I found Keaton hilarious as the captain/bed & bath store manager. The only actor I felt didn't deliver any laughs whatsoever was Coogan, if it isn't Partridge, don't bother as you're just annoying Steve! As with any Ferrell film, the dialogue is brilliant, although weirdly there was a running theme of animals in this film..from a hypothetical Tuna vs Lion fight through to flying 'like a peacock'?! The back and forth between Ferrell and Wahlberg is priceless and worth the admission fee alone in my book.Mendes plays a fantastically quirky role as Ferrell's wife and Samuel J and The Rock play an all-action cameo which have one of the weirdest deaths you're likely to see in a film.It almost felt as though Ferrell was nearly back to his best in this film, not playing an over-the-top character for once, which makes a refreshing change. Have to admit I was laughing out loud for 90% of the film but the ending did disappoint somewhat, a tad too cheezy for me.",The Other Guys
245,dgefuller,"Shift in tone for McKay, bring on The Boys!",7,13 October 2010,"Adam McKay could make terrible films for the rest of his career if he so chose, because the man is responsible for 'Anchorman'- the defining comedy of a generation and one of the funniest films ever made (FACT). He made Will Ferrell an international superstar, and hasn't made a movie without him since.Ferrell has a lot of stick, actually, and some of it's quite unfair. He gets a lot of criticism for ""playing the same role"" time and again. Well, that's simply not true. Ron Burgandy is almost a separate entity, and here he plays a dull, introverted detective who differs from all three previous McKay collaborations as much as they do from one another. It's an understated comic performance for the most part, allowing (oscar winning) Mark Whalberg an opportunity for some laughs- and the two surprisingly gel quite well on screen.The action-comedy genre is populated with cop/buddy movies: Rush Hour, 48 Hours, The Man (urgh) and the recent Cop Out- but what's striking about McKay's effort is that it's tonally more similar to 48 Hours; both films having a streak of darkness running through them. The comedy is sometimes black (Ferrell attempting to stop a potential 'jumper' from plummeting to his death with words of encouragement- and failing), sometimes heroically juvenile (the departure of Jackson and Johnson's super-cops is so funny to look at I laugh simply when I remember it in my head) but pretty much always funny.It has its pitfalls though- Ray Stevenson (so likable in 'Rome', so repugnant here) is criminally underused in this movie as one of a pantheon of potential threats, and Michael Keaton too (although a police captain who also works at Bed Bath and Beyond is a twist on his usual dual-personality roles) is always welcome to more screen time. Perhaps the romantic entanglements could have been sacrificed in exchange for more time with these characters and the wonderful Steve Coogan (Whalberg's love interest serves no purpose but to facilitate a mildly amusing recurring joke wherein Whalberg has learned ballet and the harp during his childhood in order to mock the 'fairies', and Eva Mendez is trying a bit too hard to be funny).McKay has played down the ""whacky"" aspect of his comedy in order to produce a functional and entertaining action/comedy; a (slightly) more mature tone and some impressive skill with action and effects sequences. Some may have previously suggested his landing of ""The Boys"" adaptation was a mistake- after watching 'The Other Guys', you can see how it is a bridge between his previous films and what is to come. I think he'll handle it magnificently, and given that subject matter it will hopefully inspire him to a whole new world of possibilities within his own original material.I was quietly impressed by this film; a well engineered action-comedy flick which surpasses most others in the genre (namely Cop Out). Except for 'Pineapple Express', but that's a personal choice.",The Other Guys
246,electrablind,Great social commentary with equal hilarity,7,18 January 2011,"thefilmsmith.com It seems as quickly as Will Ferrell hit it big, he was already on his way down. From Land of the Lost to Blades of Glory, Ferrell has worn out his welcome with many people due mainly to meeting a saturation point. Which is why it would be a shame if people missed The Other Guys, one of the best comedies of 2010.The first act of the film features an over the top car chase with Samuel L. Jackson and Dwayne Johnson in pursuit of some petty criminals. The scene is a thing to behold, but the comedic punch arrives when reporters ask the two supercops if the 15 million dollars in damages was worth the misdemeanor offenses by the criminals. This lets you know immediately that this is going to be a cop satire equal to Hot Fuzz.The film could stand to lose 30 minutes worth of fluff, but it subverts the traditional cop film (drugs, prostitutes, blue collar crime) to focus on white collar crime as the U.S. reels from the economic collapse wrought by such characters. It's a scathing critique of cop films, highlighting the lack of independent power in the SEC (which is supposed to prevent the types of crimes that plunged the U.S. into its worst recession since The Great Depression), and the way our judicial system allows white collar crime to fade into unimportance. Hilarious (directed by Anchorman director Adam McKay) and scathing in its critique. You have to see this film.",The Other Guys

So many things about this movie give the audience reason to laugh constantly throughout this film, as that was the case with mine. The chemistry provided by Wahlburg and Ferrell is great; the improv scenes are hilarious. Will Ferrell is finally funny again, as well- If you like ""Anchorman"" or ""Step Brothers,"" you will love this. Overall, this movie is so outrageous that it works. Is is going to win best picture? Absolutely not. Is it the most fun you'll have at the movies all summer? Absolutely. Thumbs up for ""The Other Guys.""",The Other Guys
248,Kefka_8203,Probably the worst movie I've ever seen(Mainstream),1,30 January 2011,"If there's one thing I grow tired of it's people posting a ""Worst Movie Ever!!!!"" thread in pretty much every forum on IMDb. No matte whether it's Avatar, The Godfather or Transformers, it's apparently the worst thing put on celluloid. With statements like that you need to consider some things; Amongst others; What are your guidelines? For example, I absolutely consider the Twilight movies amongst the worst pieces of crap ever made, but they are masterpieces compared to the Asylum/Syfy movies that are constantly spewn out...Does that make them good movies? No, horrible movies but ones that needs to be measured a bit differently.With that said. I hate The Other Guys, and it's one, if not THE worst mainstream movie I've ever seen. It's misogynistic, crude, stupid, pointless, annoying, badly written and with acting that would embarrass a Porn Actor. When you have seven good actors in this movie(Keaton, Wahlberg, Jackson, Johnson, Mendes, Coogan and Stevenson) and you kill of the two who could have brought some fun into this movie within ten minutes(Jackson and Johnson) you better damn well make sure your replacements are up to it. Guess what? They aren't. Wahlberg can be excellent, but here he's whiny and with the emotional range of Seagal. ""I'm a peacock! Let me fly!"" Yeah, dude...If you're as homophobic as you pretend to be...Lay off that comparison. It's stupid. Ferrell...If there is another comedian as unfunny as him this side of Vince Vaughn and Owen Wilson then humanity is in deep sh*t. Nothing he says, does or tries to get across is funny. His acting is ""ISpeakWithAMonotonousVoiceLikeThisHaHa"" or ""BLARGHABLBLAAAA!/#""""!!!!"" . Stevenson is surprisingly adept as the violent bad guy in the movie, I just wish he'd shot the Other Guys when spotting them. Mendes is...Urgh, a supermodel hottie who takes verbal abuse from her husband and smiles...And shows him her tits to motivate him at work. Keaton, oh poor Keaton...Why? Why are you in this?The ""Comedy"": The only thing I giggled at is the vulgar crudeness of the hobos having an orgy in the car, and the dedication they show to do it again. It's stupid and pre-teen stuff, but it is just too idiotic not to chuckle at. Pretty much every other joke doesn't fall flat...It smashes through the ground, yodeling while doing so.Action: ...It's a stupid, silly action comedy. Macguyver had better stuff than this.Story: Inept, silly, stupid. Words that sound familiar by now? They should. The plot isn't really there, it's mostly trying to find somewhere to sneak in in between a mix of stupid scenes.Overall: I hate the guys who made this movie, I hate the actors for being in it and I HATE the pretentious sods who gave this move such high a score.

Will Farrell gives his best as always. The humour of the movie is just not funny at all, there was one or two very short moments where i actually chuckled.

253,benbaecher,No Go,3,5 June 2011,"Talk about a movie that had potential and fell short. So you're throwing in your ingredients and you open with the Duane Johnson and Sam Jackson doing a great macho opening and they end up jumping off a roof for, like, no reason, and then Ka-put, silence. Beat. Beat. The audience explodes with laughter. Great. Perfect. Check the Gate, let's go home. Because that's what most of the audience wished they had done 80 minutes or so later. And you have Michael Keaton. He's a God! Like having Bill Murray or some other comical genius on board. Will Farrell, well, you know what you're getting with Will Farrell, and you get it, he delivers. Eva MendesWOWand that ALL works. So where's the problem? Oh yeah, the movie isn't funny. The jokes aren't funny. Mark ""E"" Mark isn't funnyhe's acting with that stupid soft delivery thing he does, which did work in Fear because he's pretending to be a soft spoken guy and is hiding that he is a psycho. I thought he was great in that, but in this movie, he's actually playing it like that's who he really is, and at times it does work, sometimes really well, but overall it doesn't. And if you're not buying one of the two leads for part of the movie, then the movie doesn't work. A very large percentage of the jokes fell really short.

254,eneyeseekaywhy,The Annoying Guys,3,19 September 2010,"Its difficult to pinpoint exactly when Will Ferrell's career took a Steve Martin-esquire nosedive. It seems to be somewhere between the needless remake of The Producers and the gag free Blades of Glory. In the early naughties he broke free of the 'Saturday Night Live' crew, starred in some feature films and became a genre unto himself (You seen that new Will Ferrell film?). During that time he gave us some quotable, laugh-at-loud performances, such as Ron Burgundy in Anchorman and Frank in Old School. However overkill is easily achieved by funny-men and Ferrell obviously didn't follow Jim Carey's career too closely. Fast forward a couple of years and we are being given diluted versions of the same characters, but this time he has a film out every second month, how could that possibly get annoying? After a string of not appalling, but also not amusing films (Semi-Pro, Land of the Lost) it seemed he had lost it completely. Luckily he's slowed down in recent years and in The Other Guys he has downplayed the wackiness somewhat. But, one more false move and he's Adam Sandler.Highsmith and Danson (played by Samuel L. Jackson and Dwayne 'The Rock' Johnson) are the two most bad-ass cops in their precinct. They get the criminals, they get the girls, they may not always follow the rules but goddammit they get the job done. Idolising them from a distance are Allen Gamble and Terry Hoitz (played by Ferrel and Mark Wahlberg). Gamble is an accountant at heart and has no interest in police-work which poses any danger. Hoitz is hungry for action but has lost his bottle having shot an unarmed sports personality. When New York Citys finest duo get killed in the line of duty, Hoitz sees this as their opportunity to step up, do some real policing and fill Highsmith and Dansons place. Luckily the first case they take leads them to a multi-billion dollar fraud ring. It looks as though The Other Guys will finally be recognised.Mark Wahlberg seems slightly confused throughout the whole film as to whether he's the straight man or grabbing for laughs too. He also seems to be genuinely frustrated with Ferrell (you can tell because Marky Mark is not the greatest actor). Whilst they both give us some giggles and the supporting cast know how to deliver a joke, its hard to do a lot with poor scripting. Michael Keaton delivers some of the funniest material in the film but sadly has very little on-screen time. The entire film had roughly ten to twelve jokes rehashed again and again. As we all know, jokes get funnier the second time round, so by the tenth time round it felt as if I was being hit with an hilarity stick and it was almost too much to take.The Other guys is not a great comedy by any means, it delivers some giggles and for those in need of a Ferrell fix it will sate your appetite somewhat. For others, there's a scene about halfway through with Will Ferrell explaining why an FBI mug with 'Female Body Inspector' on it is funny. Wahlberg interrupts him and screams 'Shut up!'. I think it's an outtake.",The Other Guys
255,TheGame111073,A Tragic Misuse of Talent,5,15 January 2011,"The Other Guys is a depressing flirtation with comedy that abuses the fans base of the actors who star in the movie. The film is a faintly amusing disappointment that does not live up to the star power that it contains. The Other Guys an extremely disappointing attempt at comedy. The film delivers a few fleeting moments of humor that evaporate quickly. It is a brief tease with being humorous but not enough to entertain even the most devote fan of Will Ferrell. The movie is no where near as funny as it should have have been. The Other Guy has a number of really good comedic scenes but they are quickly drowned out by the next unfunny one. The film has a great collection of stars and it simply misuses the entire cast. Samuel L. Jackson and Dwayne Johnson were the best cop duo in the film. Their brief appearance of the film stole every scene that they were in. The film's value quickly dropped once their characters left the movie. The other buddy cop duos in the film didn't measure up to Jackson and Johnson in the story or with their performance. Wayans, Jr and Ripple as or the focus of the story Ferrell and Walhberg.The movie has a few brief moments of comedic genius. Some of the comedic scenes are extremely funny such as Alan's (Ferrell) irritating humming of SWAT's theme song while doing paperwork to irritate Terry (Walhberg), Terry's accidental shooting of Derek Jeter, the wooden gun that Alan is forced to carry, the scene where the explosion knocks both of them to the ground, Terry's openly disrespectful obsession with Alan's wife, Alan's college persona of the pimp, ""Gator."" The Other Guys does have its great moments but they are more overshadowed by the multitude of bad ones. I think my expectations for this movie were too high which led to my level of disappointment in this movie. I really love Will Ferrell's movies, I am one of his biggest supporters. However, The Other Guys is a disastrous catastrophe that has literally shaken my faith in Will Ferrell's comedic ability.

257,pjvanes69,The other cop out,4,9 October 2012,"The problem I find with a lot of comedies today is that directors often have too much faith in their leading comedians to be naturally funny and almost no faith in the comedic value of the script. It's almost as if the screenwriter hasn't bothered to write any dialog figuring that the actors will just make up funny stuff anyway so there's no point. How often have you heard a director say ""I just rolled the camera and witnessed improvisational comedic genius take after take"" in a making of which is usually followed by "" I just didn't want to cut any of it out"" and unfortunately they usually don't. Comedy works best when its found within the circumstances of the plot not forced out of every moment. Comedy also usually works best when it's balanced with drama. The filmmakers have to realize that not every moment can be funny, you have to have a release before the next build up. Same goes for any form of audience mood manipulation, one cat jumping out of a closet will probably scare your audience, the fifth in a row almost definitely wont but these days when it comes to comedy everything is over played for laughs. It's almost as if the actors are ramping it up more and more in each scene, shouting out hey look at me I'm soooo funny right now. Ferrell is a funny guy, there's no doubt about it, but of late he's been let off his leash far too often and ends up rambling, falling back on his ever faithful man-child persona. Wahlberg on the other hand is not a naturally funny guy and he's left to compensate by exploding into an over the top performance in every second scene, so much so that Ferrell's character even points this out and verbalizes what the audience is thinking - ""we're so sick of it already"", yes Mark, it's not working. The other downer is that like Cop Out there's not that much chemistry between the two cops, though at least both actors appear to want to be there rather than just going through the motions as Bruce Willis did with Tracy Morgan.To top it off, for what is meant to be a comedy, we're presented with a rather convoluted and surprisingly involved plot about financial embezzlement and corporate greed committed by the most boring, unfunny bunch of non-villains I've seen in a long time. There's a few laughs here and there and the production value is great but ultimately there's very little to like about The Other Guys.",The Other Guys
258,Jaguara333,Starts well but drops off halfway,5,8 September 2017,"I would agree with many other reviewers that the best part of this film is early on. I was not quite sure when it started to lose it and was not fully conscious of it at the time. Sort of like how a frog will jump out of a hot pot immediately but if you boil it slowly it will stay there until it dies. With this film by the time I realized that it was gone it was too late. It was a slow gradual decline, but with moments here and there that would give you hope for it pulling it back together.Overall the film was a reasonably entertaining spoof on The NeverEnding stream of police/crime action films. It plays on many of the tropes of that genre and it's ridiculousness is a reflection of those tropes and the genre itself. I was surprised though that the plot was relatively coherent and maintained its own internal consistency. I'm used to most films like this not even trying to avoid plot holes, but rather lazily Revel in them. In this film almost everything ties back into the plot in some way. So while it often had a very juvenile humor, it also had a rather clever plot line that could be appreciated by someone more intellectual. This might make the film a good choice for a father and son to watch together.I would have rated closer to 7 for the first part and more like three for the final segments. I'll put it at 5 overall.

260,dazworthy,Promised more than it delivered,5,2 November 2010,"Director Adam McKay again teams up with Will Ferrell in this action comedy about two New York detectives Allen Gamble (Ferrell) and his partner Terry Hoitz (played by Mark Wahlberg). The pair are the joke of the precinct given Gamble is a forensic accountant with an aversion for action, and Hoitz is the butt of jokes having been involved in an infamous shooting incident. They live in the shadow of the precinct's two hero hot-shot cops, hilariously over-played by Samuel L Jackson and Dwayne Johnson, but Hoitz wants he and his annoying partner to step-up instead of just being the ""other guys"". Fans of Will Ferrell will probably like his performance. His awkward, irrational brand of humor is here. He has some great dialog where he goes off onto his trademark long-winded tangents in the middle of conversations. But I think Mark Wahlberg steals the show. He is a surprisingly good comic actor and his irrationally angry and resentful character actually provides some of the movies funnier moments. The supporting cast includes Eva Mendez as Gamble's under-appreciated wife, and Michael Keaton as the Captain. I have to say I was really looking forward to this movie but I was a little disappointed. The jokes in The Other Guys are a little hit and miss. Some of the humor is almost weird at times, so it will definitely not suit all tastes, and unfortunately most of the best bits are in the trailer.

Some how they have managed to gel it into the right mix with this one where you don't feel like an idiot watching it and it's good. It really feels like wil (and some other SNL latelys) has always wanted to do what John and Dan did with movies but none of them ever got it right mostly using outrageousness to make up for talent. this movie has the feel and the quality/talent of the good SNL movies. Like baby bear's porridge it's not much and not too little, it's just right. I would assume that the director had a lot to do with it.

I haven't laughed this hard since Hot tub time machine seriously. Will Ferrell acts kind of like he did in Stranger than Fiction. Thou he does figure out how 2 crack away @ his weirdly calm shell better & wiggles around his bad guy side with ease. The back stories of both cops were great and not to long. The whole cast did great & Eva mendes was a bit underused maybe but she was great fun and crazier @ the end so that made up 4 it. Overall, music was fun, don't know if TLC will sue the lead captain for his completely random use of their song lyrics. That was a perfect topping on the seriousness of yet another clueless acting cop in this movie. They all seem 2 be blindsided except the weasel Will Ferrell. Go geeks! Lastly, Samuel Jackson just gets crazier every movie he gets in it seems. Did not expect what happened at all.

This is hardly realistic, generously exaggerated, and certainly not for everyone to be able to laugh at. But if my descriptions are making sense to you on an emotional or gut-feeling level, if you feel how a movie like that would be like, and you think you can laugh at it, then definitely watch it. A niche kind of comedy that should make the compatible audience laugh with abandon, and probably keep remembering certain lines and scenes for a long time to come.",The Other Guys

It seemed like it was going to be funny with great lines from Samuel L Jackson and Dwayne Johnson vs Mark Wahlberg and Will Ferrell. Then it started being lame repeated gags over and over. With actors like Michael Keaton, Damon Wayans Jr and other cast members, they seem to barely give them funny lines and left Mark and Will holding the burden of keeping the jokes. They simply dont have enough comedic power between for a 2 hr movie. I couldn't finish it the movie and believe me I tried.",The Other Guys
270,jackhammer111,It's a good movie! And it's very very funny!,7,26 January 2021,"I enjoyed this a whole lot more than I thought I would. I'm not as high on Mark Wahlberg as most people are and I don't really like Will Ferrell generally. In fact I hate some of his work. But this movie works and they work together. I'm going to give the writing most of the credit here. The comedy writing is so good here but it's almost hard not to pull it off. I'm glad they got that jumping off the building thing out of the way early in the movie and honestly I think the movie could have done without it but I liked all of the individual performances in it but honestly, I think you could have plugged many different actors into these roles in the movie would have worked cuz the script is hilarious and the movie is well put together. I know Michael Keaton didn't play a big part but I've been a huge fan of his like forever. I'm 70 years old so when I say forever I mean it LOL I'm not sure this movie could even have got made in a post me-too movement world I'm sad to say but somehow the storytelling managed to take this absurd comedy and create the perfect ending. Endings are the hardest part of movies. I've seen so many movies with endings that failed the rest of the movie. I was touched by the ending and didn't find it corny at all. It was a great ending to a really good movie.The only thing the keeps me from rating this movie one or even two stars higher than I did is that I am sick to death of the notion that you've got to put long ridiculous Chase scenes in every movie. Fortunately, I streamed it so I could just speed through the chase scene. Any Movie Makers out there reading this please get the point. That chase scene is no better or no worse or no different than dozens of other movies. Are there really that many people who want to watch a movie like this just to see crap get blown up? I'm hoping there are more people out here like me that appreciate this movie because of the performances and the great comedy writing. I'm not going to remember this movie because of the stunts. In fact, I could say I'm going to remember it despite the stunts. Problem is that movie studios are in fact just like most any other huge corporations in that they are increasingly driven by their marketing departments. the marketing departments are the tail wagging the dog. The marketing department probably thanks it has data from surveys on charts and graphs that show that if you do this and this in a movie it will make more money. Funny thing though, nobody's ever surveyed me. If they'd surveyed me I'd be telling them that I don't watch movies very much anymore because there are certain things that I'm sick to death of. I wonder when they count the moviegoers that they attract if they're aware of the moviegoers they lose. Not meaning that they watch some other kind of movie, but meaning they stopped watching movies altogether. Movies and TVs are far from the only source of entertainment these days. Nobody seems to be interested in getting people like me back into the theaters. But I do realize this is an odd time to be making this argument when we can't go to movies at all until we're sure we're not going to catch a deadly disease.",The Other Guys
271,johnl1957,Just Awful,1,19 August 2010,"Having seen this movie I feel like the people writing these positive reviews didn't. I liked the previews and thought this was a great concept. I kept waiting for something funny. I was patient, even when several people walked out of the theater. I was tempted to join them, but I hung in there thinking, ""this has to get better."" Sadly it never did. There were no big laughs from the audience and only a few slight chuckles. It's a good cast, but there is no chemistry. It's not even silly, as many of Will Ferrell's best movies are. It's predictable and boring.If you have to see it wait until the DVD comes out.

272,zettaichan,"Some good improv, but it can't save this movie",3,6 February 2011,"There are funny moments in The Other Guys, but they mostly seem to be due to offbeat line readings and on the spot improvisation. Will Ferrell, Michael Keaton, Eva Mendes and Steve Coogan are all responsible for some good bits, but overall this thing doesn't work.The script can't stop patting itself on the back for making scathing jokes about TARP and financial scandals. But don't get too excited, left-leaning viewers, because as much as you might like the satire of capitalist excesses, you'll be put off by the relentless sexism and homophobia.There are ways to make jokes about the macho culture of police officers without wallowing in a million woman-hating, gay-bashing one-liners. The cops are all portrayed as violent, sexist, homophobic fools. I thought the movie might show these childish characters growing up a little. That never happened.The best Will Ferrell movies, like Anchorman and Talledega Nights, follow his man-child characters as they mature just a tiny bit. In The Other Guys, Ferrell starts as a naive but level-headed character who doesn't need to grow up; he just needs to take off his blinders. None of the other characters change. Mark Wahlberg starts with grating, inexplicable anger cranked up to 11 and doesn't seem to know where to go from there. There's no buddy chemistry between Ferrell and Wahlberg. The action scenes are fine, but unexciting; who cares about slow-mo gunfights anymore? And since most action movies do such over-the-top stunts these days, there's not much The Other Guys can do to comically exaggerate the action.Skip this limp attempt and watch Hot Fuzz instead: it's a much more observant and clever parody of buddy cop movies, and there are so many jokes packed in, you can watch it again and again and find new things that will actually make you laugh all the way through.",The Other Guys

There was a lot of dead time after most of the 'joke' moments, and the jokes missed—sometimes by a lot. Too bad Michael Keaton wasn't 10 years younger and he could have played both of the 'other guys' by himself. What the heck, he did it in multiplicity. Now that was funny! Keaton is brilliant with this sort of comedy. Any sort of comedy, for that matter. I wanted more Keaton! (my dad's a big Keaton fan, so I've seen all of them). I will give it to Ferrell, he did his job very well. But the jokes or the timing wasn't there for some reason with his partner, and we all like Walhberg (meow!), but they didn't team up right or something. Then again, maybe it was the writing or editing. But it wouldn't be the editing because comedy should be on all the players. It's timing, reaction, playing off each other, good material, give and take (like the Marx brothers, Laurel and Hardy, Abbott and Costello, Gene Wilder and Richard Pryor, Wilder and Feldman, Eugene Levy and John Candy or Keaton—I'm a chip off the old block, dad loved the classics). It's about chemistry. I don't think the studios are going to rush out anytime soon to make another Ferrell/Walhberg comedy. But the Rock and Sam Jackson, now there's a thought.",The Other Guys
274,parisa6,Will Ferrell is BACK! Mark Wahlberg is perfect.,8,7 August 2010,"Just when you think, ""If you've seen one Will Ferrell movie, you've seen them all,"" think again. Ferrell is back and totally redeems himself from the flop that was Land of the Lost by giving one of his most genius performances to date. It does help that Ferrell is partnered with hottie Mark Wahlberg who delivers a superbly-angst-ridden-yet-hilariously-gut-ripping performance. The movie is filled with fresh, sarcastic, and humorous one-liners, non-stop laughter, plenty of action, car chases, and explosions, and a complex plot with a thought-provoking political message. Just make sure you stay through the credits.I cant't remember the last time I laughed out this loud and this often in a movie theater. One early particular scene in the movie in which Ferrell and Wahlberg argue over whether a lion or a tuna would win in a fight is so well acted and delivered that I was left gasping for air after laughing so hard. And don't be too sure you know who would win such fight, because their logic doesn't go the way any of us could have imagined.I watched this movie right after I saw the painfully boring Dinner for Schmucks. But that can't be the only reason I loved this movie because the whole theater was laughing and clapping along with me, so much so, that I missed half the jokes due to the sheer volume of both.

I know its bad when I'm watching an alleged comedy and find myself concentrating in the vain hope of that I'll catch something truly funny going on, I know something's wrong. That something is the perennially unfunny Will Ferrel. He just flat out tries too hard to be funny and quirky without any spark of genuine comedic ease. I know he didn't write this but it so smacks of his style. OK, I do hate this guy so this flick had one foot in the grave from the get go. But nothing seemed to redeem this film.

I also very much enjoy Will Ferrells Character who is not a genius but also is not nearly as dumbed down as his typical characters.

He doesn't need to be literally funny just to fit into the movie but all those dark and sadistic humors make his characters solid!!

As for the supporting casts, it is nice to see Michael Keaton(the Batman fame) being adorably bossy around with Eva Mendas's sexy essence seducing Mark Wahlberg and Steve Coogan committing lousy crimes. Not to mention Mr. Punisher(Ray Stevenson) messing with the cops with cocky Australian charisma as well!! The plot is.....hmmmmm...rather typical and cheesy when it comes to last 20 minutes of the movie. It is kinda Eye-sick to see those slow mo actions with Lame cops dodge off all bullets and get bad guys busted.

Every time when I get annoyed by one of Allen's lame jokes, I can see Terry is also annoyed by it. So, I hold on my thoughts. That is a pretty interesting combination of lame and seriousness which holds the movie to its obvious ending.There is a bit of audience cheating going on as well. Jackson and Johnson opened the movie with heavy action, and just vanished in thin air, after 10 minutes, without even a proper excuse!

The story itself is not what makes this movie fun to watch, but instead to see the chemistry that goes on between Ferrell and Wahlberg. Their characters, who minds are complete opposite of each other works great for some good laughs throughout the movie. I love that the movie is set in a police environment, and that we get to see the odd police partnership play out between these two main characters. The flaw I have for this movie is the opportunities the movie misses to make it even funnier. The jokes in the movie mostly consist of what looks like improvised talk, and it's hard to find some real jokes in the movie without witnessing Wahlberg yelling all the time and Ferrell's mumbling. I feel the script could have been much better, but that isn't to say that the movie isn't funny at all, because it certainly has some scenes that will make you laugh. The crime- solving story isn't really that exiting to watch, which makes you more focused on how well Will and Wahlberg can deliver a funny performance.

The jokes should have been funny, they all fell flat. It felt like I was watching a movie these guys made as a goof. I left the theater actually angry at the awfulness of this movie. Mark Wahlberg ACTUALLY sounded like the joke character from SNL (say hi to your motha for me). Ferrell is a great comedic actor, but in this mess, he came off like an overindulgent jerk. I don't know if these lines were ad-libbed or written--either way it was an embarrassment. I felt embarrassed for Mckay and co. , cause I know they are better than this garbage.",The Other Guys
307,jhayeshs,jokes are random but HILARIOUS,7,16 August 2010,"The Other Guys was an absolutely hilarious movie, and I think many would agree it can be compared to The Hangover. The only problem was, I really wasn't following the story. If you're someone who just wants to good laughs, this movie will give them to you, but if you want a full, great movie experience, this isn't it. The jokes alone earn this movie 7 out of 10 in my opinion. This movie is said to have completed what Cop Out missed, and I agree with that statement, solely for the fact that this movie was FUNNY. No story, not very good lines, but a funny movie, and it is a comedy so a job well done! Go ahead and enjoy this movie for you will not see jokes like this.",The Other Guys
308,KindredSouls,"Fun, fun, fun !",8,8 August 2010,"I think most people have given a pretty accurate summary of the movie, so I won't get into that. I will just say that I loved the chemistry with Will and Mark-they work together very well. It was a blast seeing Michael Keaton on the big screen again, and he's another one Will has great chemistry with. But then, I think Will has it with almost everyone, so I'm biased. The movie was hilarious. There were several moments my friend almost choked on her popcorn during some of the funnier scenes. I highly recommend it as a fun summer movie, and hey-I absolutely would not mind a sequel, if they have a great story. As far as other people's comments that it is not as good as Anchorman, I disagree. I just didn't like Anchorman, though. I've watched it several times, and I just don't like it.

309,anexocopia,what is the point of this movie?,2,27 November 2010,"I have to start by clarifying what is the intention of a comedy movie. The main trait must be to make people laugh. The rest might be a refreshing break for all day to day things that happen in the world.This failed comedy begins rashly with two good action-comedian actors: the rock Johnson and Samuel L Jackson. They both carried the first minutes of the flick straight, which makes people think that the movie is going to be good. But it's only a placebo that unveils itself once the ""The other guys"" are introduced.I'm not saying that Ferrel is not a good comedian. He is (although not great). But he's got the bad taste to select awful roles recently. As for Wahlberg, he is totally unfit in the role of a comedian. So, it's not necessary to say that he was miscast.Thus, people should blame the producers and writers for this mess since there is not point in this attempted comedy. So, the only thing that I can infer is that this movie is meant to get money from naive people's pockets.",The Other Guys

Unfortunately there were only a couple of times it happened. As you can see from the ratings on this movie you either loved it or hated it. And as you can see from my vote I wasn't one who loved it. Most of the bits were lame. Instead of moving on to a new joke they returned to the same joke time and time again until you were ready to commit violence. Ferrell and Wahlberg have no chemistry. In fact it seemed that Wahlberg was ready to commit some violence on Ferrell because of his annoying babbling. Too bad his character didn't just blow Ferrell's character's head off early in the movie and save us from his repetitive yammering. Will Ferrell is a one joke comedian. Once you've heard the joke it gets less funny every time you hear it. Seeing this garbage makes me wish he was really on fire in Talladega Nights. He deserves it.Spoiler Alert!!!! When I saw who was in the cast of this movie I was sure it was going to be a good film. It just goes to show how wrong you can be about things even when you carefully read the label. Michael Keaton should have run screaming in the other direction when he was presented this script. His performance was bad, bad, bad. Samuel L. Jackson and Dwayne Johnson were the high points of this film. Their over the top portrayal of the super-cops was a scream. The entertainment value of this movie ended with their arrival on the sidewalk.This disjointed, poorly written, poorly acted ""adventure"" cost me a couple of hours of my life I'll never get back. Thankfully it only cost me $1.50 from RedBox.

And I still have a huge ""What the heck just happened?!"" stamped on my forehead after what happened to them.No one really ""stole"" this movie; meaning, there wasn't really a standout performance from anyone. Everyone was just... funny. There was a couple of interesting humor like the silent fight during the funeral and one of the cops ""tweeting"" and Michael Keaton quoting TLC songs, as well as some other memorable scenes.This movie has enough action to satisfy the plot and very few (if any) twists. It was simple and to the point, which I haven't decided yet if that's a good thing or a bad thing.

A few groups of people left in the middle, and I wish I had done the same. I cannot find one redeeming aspect of this movie and I was the one who really wanted to see it! A huge disappointment. Some others in the theater had a laugh every now and then, but mostly were quiet. The acting was poor and the actors were wasted on the script. The shootouts were asinine, the dialogue was idiotic, and the NYPD are all made out to be two-dimensional morons. Michael Keaton is wasted here, and you know the movie is in trouble when he is the only 'sane' one on the screen. My suggestion: ""aim for the bushes"". I, too, wanted to jump.",The Other Guys

Um, not sure of the story line really, just the loser cop teams up with the other cop and want to be the new BEST cops.The previous BEST cops, The Rock and Smual start out great, maybe a laugh or two, but then their parts are done with for the movie, i won't spoil it, loose term there, if at any time you feel spoiled in this movie you need your head read.I gave this film 1 star, there is no way i can support the making of such bad films, these just need to go right to free TV, late night, as repeats, i sure as hell hope no one has seen this in the cinema?, surely not.You have been advised.",The Other Guys

The story and script are so poorly written/edited that it even makes the stellar cast seem like bad actors. Through the entire movie, you just sit there waiting for it to get better, but it never does. There is never a connection between Ferrell and Wahlberg, neither comedically or as partners on the police force, nor is there a connection with the supporting cast. The entire movie seems disjointed and boring with a few funny parts thrown in to keep you from walking out on the movie.

I'm a Will Ferrell fan but haven't been impressed with a lot of his movies lately where he's the main character but love him in Old School, etc. I like Mark Walberg but not as a lead actor in most cases. He seems to be better behind the scenes now. I figured I'd take a chance and try it out to pass some time but ended up turning it off near the end, uninterested in seeing anymore crap acting, horrible story lines, non- humor, etc. Very disappointing movie and not ever worth a rental on a rainy Sunday afternoon unless you want to use it to ignore and fall asleep with sound on in the background. I still don't know what the hell they were thinking making a crap movie like this. Another example of how Hollywood can put some A list actors in a movie and not worry about the script.

I'm not so sure anymore. A lot of respectable actors signed up for this dud. Why? Did it seem funnier on the page? In the spirit of 80's action flicks, ""the Other Guys"" asks the question ""How many one-liners can we pack into a two hour movie?"" When you loosely weave a story around that objective, as ""the Other Guys"" demonstrates, the answer is: A LOT. Particularly when they don't need to be witty, clever, or ironic one-liners... in fact, when they don't need to meet any criteria at all.I gave it three stars...one star for seldomly making me snort (by which I mean a partially-formed laugh that exited from my nose), one star for a chance to look at Eva Mendes, and one star as a thanks for expanding my list of people that indicate red flags for any comedy they happen to be associated with in the near future.",The Other Guys

I genuinely thought that Wahlberg and Ferrell as the leading duo would have me rolling in laughter, but instead, I was rolled up in a ball in my seat snoozing away. Ferrell's character was a strange hybrid of slapstick and dry humor that left you sitting in utter boredom.

We were looking for something funny and uplifting, and had very low expectations of The Other Guys. The Other Guys failed to deliver on any positive level. Let's go through the reasons why. 1. When 2 of your 6 best actors are ""killed off"" in the first 5 minutes, you minimize the number of actors left to carry a movie. 2. When your only funny interaction between actors is between the male lead and the female lead, and it lasts for only 5 minutes of the movie, you minimize the number of laughs your comedy can have. And finally, 3. when you put every single laugh into the trailer, and leave absolutely zero remaining laughs for the other 102 of the 107 minutes of the movie, the audience will not laugh and will look for a way to leave the theater. I personally saw at least 2 separate groups of people leave and never return. My wife asked me numerous times, ""Is this ever going to get funny"". This movie failed on so many levels, with what should have been a great cast. Wahlberg was terrible, Mendes only was on screen for 5 minutes, Michael Keaton was given very little to work with and Ferrell was lost in a pool of ""Huh?"" This movie left me with questions though... why didn't they keep Samuel L. Jackson and The Rock alive, and have them compete against the other guys? Why didn't they have Mendes on screen more? Why didn't they remember to include any laughs in the movie? Questions, all left with no easily found answers.

But listen carefully. It's pure genius. And with such a poor rating, I feel sorry for Adam McKay, because this is in my opinion his greatest achievement. He is on par with David zuckers older work with naked gun. Pure comedy genius. Will Ferrell gives one of his best performances here. Likewise with mark wahlberg. But please pay attention to the casting. Steve coogan plays such a genius role in a sense that fits his comedy perfectly into this epic film. It's dry, it's hidden message is just pure genius and you just have to pay full attention and that's it.

With the star power available, I did not see any way I would be disappointed with the outcome, boy was I wrong.I can tell you now, the funniest parts of the movie are seen in the trailers for the film and even one of those did not make the final cut. How could the acting skill in Samuel L Jackson, Mark Wahlberg, Will Ferrell, Michael Keaton and even ""The Rock"" butcher such a movie? To their credit, each one of the actors did what they could to save the movie, but the plot was so bad, the scenes looked like they were filmed without a storyline and pieced together to try and make a plot, which never materialized. The ""bad guys"" didn't seem bad, which gave no reason to even care about the characters.In the end, each one of the actors will look back at this film and undoubtedly feel this was the worst movie that they took part in.

However, when you see it, at parts, wonder ""is this movie ever going to be over"". It's not that it's painfully boring throughout, but it has it's painfully boring and very not funny parts. With that said, it also has it's extremely funny parts. When Mark is driving around in Will's red Prius and say's it seems like they are driving around in a giant va*ina, I almost died laughing. But I will say, most of the super funny parts were shown in the commercials and trailers, which is why this movie proved to be somewhat disappointing to me. I went into the movies expecting to see another Will Ferrell gem, seeing as he was teamed up with Wahlberg who seemed, from the trailers, to be extremely funny in this movie considering he kept his well known ""bad boy"" facade on while still being funny. Don't get me wrong, this wasn't a very un funny movie. But at the same time, it didn't come close to living up to expectations and what the trailers made it out to seem like.

If you have only seen a few movies and TV shows in your life, you obviously are not going to get the references they make in the movie. That doesn't give you the right to say it's not funny.

The parts that tried to be funny seemed flat, the parts that tried to be dramatic were tedious and many of the action scenes seemed intentionally overdone, to the point of being corny. The places where this film scored were the stupid parts, many of which were SO stupid they were hilarious.Dwayne Johnson and Samuel Jackson were excellent; Michael Keaton is solid, as usual, and I think my hardest laughs were at scenes with Eva Mendez, especially the ones featuring her character's mother.Judged against those sorts of all-in-one movies, I'd probably give this a 7 out of 10; judged against all kinds of movies, though, it's probably worth only about a 3 or a 4. In fairness, that could just be because in the last few days I watched Red and Red 2 for the first time, both of which did better at pulling off the action/drama/comedy trifecta, in my opinion.",The Other Guys

A real disappointment.Yes, there is some clever dialog. Yes, some of the scenes make you laugh. It simply never achieves its potential. Watching it was like finding a pile of pieces of a broken vase. You sense that, if you can put them together correctly, you will have something of real beauty and great value. But, no matter how hard you try, you just can't get the pieces to fit together in an coherent manner.Samuel L. Jackson and Dwayne Johnson are great. Their scenes work, in part because they're characters are so over the top. But, after that, much of the dialog seems wooden, and the action contrived. It put me to sleep mid-way through. When I woke up, it was still bad. I have to think it was (poor) direction that created the problem. Possibly, the sequence of shooting undermined the cast's ability to 'get into' any semblance of character.

Once again he plays an immature, loud buffoon that feigns towards humor and then shies away as if the writers intentionally cut the punchline out of every joke. I admit there were a few times when I cracked a smile out of guilty obligation, but if one is looking for a funny movie, look elsewhere. Mark Wahlberg has demonstrated time and time again that he is a disappointment on screen, and its getting pretty obvious that if Nicolas Cage won't do a role, then there's always Markie Mark. This cast was extremely weak including the likes of Dwayne ""The Rock and horrible Actor"" Johnson, and the never popular Michael Keaton who butchers every scene as if he was put there by complete error.

Unfortunately, I was disappointed once again by ""The Other Guys"", a motion picture so repugnant that I was unable to watch it to a conclusion.At the outset, the combination of Dwayne Johnson (The Rock) and Samuel L. Jackson offered much promise. But the moment these two super-cops met their demise (about five minutes into the film) -- and especially the way their deaths occurred -- told me the writers' sense of humor was badly askew.The next 15 minutes confirmed that impression. I won't say the humor was flat or not funny; there WAS no humor. I was embarrassed for Farrell and the other actors and finally had to turn off the DVD at the 20 minute mark. What offered great promise ended up as another Ferrell Flop.""The Other Guys"" surpasses water boarding for truly excruciating torture.

I don't think that he should be cast in comedic roles however. Ferrell has his own way of comedy and sometimes it fits, other times it gets to repetitive and annoying.The first 15 minutes of this movie made me want to stop watching it. However, I was somehow drawn to it just to see how bad the movie actually was. The duo of Ferrell and Wahlberg doesn't click. The movie tried way to much to be funny and most scenes have bad comedic timing and are drawn out in ways that obviously were supposed to be funny. Not even the action was entertaining until near the end where there is a chase seen that I kind of found interesting. I my opinion, this movie wasn't even worth a rental.I must admit that I found Anchorman a bit better then this. Stepbrothers made me laugh at some points but I still wasn't a great movie. How this movie got about 5 stars in the rating is beyond my understanding.

I would call him too ambitious for stepping out of his genre if it weren't for the apparent lack of effort in the writing and editing. The script was uneven, with a plot unsure of how to progress and seemingly secondary to the banter between Ferrell and Wahlberg, who failed to capture any real chemistry as partners. Wahlberg, in the movie, actually played a large caricature of himself and the character development for both leads was too far from believable to have anything but a negative impact on the film as a whole. I found myself wondering when this movie was going to get better only to see it take multiple turns for the worse, leaving me shaking my head in disappointment. I was disappointed scene after scene throughout. Even the surprise political message during the credits was out of place and I found myself wondering if this movie had actually been viewed all the way through before its release to catch any disjointed flow. The only redeeming factors are the funny one liners that McKay movies have always triumphed on, but even some of those were misplaced, too ridiculous, or just forced.",The Other Guys
362,hal8000-1,Will Farrell teams up with Mark Wahlberg to make a steaming loaf. Scratch that...there was nothing steaming about this loaf.,2,11 January 2011,"I gave this movie a 2 because I actually watched the whole thing, although I'm not sure why. First of all let me say that I love campy comedies, but I did not laugh at this movie once. I did smile during the scene where the helicopter lands on the driving range and everyone hits it with golf balls, because that is exactly what would happen on a driving range, but that was it: I smiled at the one scene that had any relevance to life, what-so-ever.The rest of this movie was a miserable, soulless, vapid attempt at comedy. Oh it was shiny, and there were cameos and TONS of ""talented actors"", but it really was just a polished turd. It reminded me of those ""third in a series"" movies...like ""Austin Powers III"" or ""Oceans 13"", where they fill the movie to the rim with people to help camouflage the fact that the script and the subject are just worn out. I think someone needs to educate the creators of this movie that the audience needs only the slightest bit of real character development to appreciate a film. When you create a movie filled entirely with the same, one-dimensional characters, it's like watching a 2 hour commercial...except that even commercials have better character development than this movie.Thank god for Eva Mendez - she was the only one that added a little grounding to this farce. Everything else will insult your intelligence with the notion that all Hollywood needs to do is get a bunch of known actors together to simultaneously phone-in a glib movie, and you've been given your money's worth. (according to IMDb, this movie cost $100 million to make? MY GOD what a waste)Want a funny, awesome cop-buddy movie? Rent ""Hot Fuzz"".

So when I saw a 7.1, I was expecting a fairly decent comedy out of two seasoned actors. However, the movie fails on a number of counts:1. Parts of the script play out like a broken tape recorder i.e. mind- numbing repetition of the same lines and similar jokes. It's as if the script writer got permission to put only 10 funny lines in a comedy movie and tried to squeeze every last drop of humor out of them. Constant references to TLC, Wahlberg's ""I'm a peacock"" line, the constant portrayal of Will Ferrell as a paper-pushing dork etc. made me feel like my mind was turning to mush as the movie progressed. 2. They weren't kidding when they rated it PG-13 for ""crude ...language"". The movie is overwrought with misogynistic comments and jokes. It literally reminded me of being in school watching a bunch of prepubescent guys belt out one liners like:""I didn't know they sold tampons on wheels"" (referring to the Red Prius that Will Ferrell drives), or, ""I feel like i'm sitting inside a v****a"" (referring to the Prius again).Orgy loving hobos, a grandma passing sexually explicit messages between her daughter and son-in-law etc etc etc. The list is long and I could go on all day. They really overdid it on that count. 3. The plot is weak and devoid of details. It looks like the filmmakers were hoping that no one would care about the story or central theme with the ""in-your-face"" ""comedy"". Ferrell and Wahlberg are paper pushing cops (for feeble reasons that are revealed in the movie, and really not worth my time to list) who accidentally stumble into a case far larger than either of them imagined. Contrary to what the plot summary says, nobody wants a part of this case, and the only reason they get into it is because Ershon forgets to file for scaffolding permits for a few buildings he owns. Their investigation ruffles a few feathers and everything goes downhill from there. All of this while these two mismatched cops try to ""find themselves"", resolve their differences, and fill the shoes of the two knuckle headed ""red-bull high"" macho cops who randomly jump off a building at the beginning of the movie. Throw in a few car chases, bullets flying willy-nilly, and a stupid wooden gun that Will Ferrell totes around (which is supposed to be soooooo funny for some reason), and that's the summary of this movie for you.

If you expect this film to be 48 Hours or any other ""tough guy gets stuck with funny dude"" movie you are about to be disappointed. It has more character, less drama and non-stop absurdity.

I never was a fan of Mark Wahlberg but this was the first time I saw some sort of genuine humanity in him since ""Three Kings"".The leads were not shadowed by supporting roles but Eva Mendes, Samuel L.

However the entire experience was like watching a stand up comic bomb..at a very slow pace. It seemed the writers thought of a few good one liners, comebacks, and scenarios and threw it on the screen hoping that something would stick. It was awkward to say the least. Additionally it seemed as if Ferrel was acting in another movie..as though he was trying to ""seriously"" portray his character as a genuine individualistic oddball/geek relative to the other cops...not going for laughs at all..like a straight man. Except for a few teenagers , who probably laugh at anything, the theater was quiet much of the time(the audience that is). If it wasn't for the sound of the movie ..you could have heard a pin drop much of the time. Wahlberg ..well it was hard to believe he was a major league movie star in recent past....his acting ability seemed on par with a college age boy in a community theater production. Like I stated earlier it fell flat for me , my companions and most of the audience present. The only real actors who seemed to show ""talent"" and were believable in their roles were the England accented crook and the Australian accented bodyguard.

However, if you've seen any movie where Will Ferrell is the star, there are some awkward jokes, and rather than just let them die so that the one guy in the back can laugh his ass off, they decided to drag each one out much longer than it had to be. Most notable are the ones where Ferrell plays his usual nerdy-yet-extremely-obnoxious character, who yells profanities (or randomness, which is much more the case this time) to get no where near a realistic feel, which I certainly need for a comedy to work.To make a long story short, this movie was the only one I've ever walked out on.

First off how many movies are they going to pay Mark Walberg to make before they realize he cannot act. I get hes cool and in good shape, but he just doesn't have any acting ability. Besides not being able to act he also is not funny at all so most of the movie is left to Ferrell. I like Will Ferrell but every movie I see him in is like a SNL episode, half of it is funny the other half is horribly boring. There were quite a few funny bits that will be used on radio shows but the plot was non existent the character development was very weak and there were lots of bits stolen from other movies. There are several unbelievable car chases and property damage (into the millions) that no cop would get away with. I mean I understand that its a movie and movie goers must suspend belief, but give me a little bit of reality mixed in. Michael Keaton who plays the captain of their squad is woefully misused in this movie and frankly is starting to look like Mickey Rooney. Another problem I have with this and lot of other movies is advertising within the movie. Don't these aholes make enough off of the movie? Why do they have to constantly put store ads like Bed Bath and Beyond in their movies? Also they need to stop showing commercials at the beginning of the movies.

Going to see this movie, there was hope for entertainment, humor so one could laugh, and yes there was that. The movie had great physical humor when it was acted out right and a pretty well laid out attention grabbing plot.But, this movies plot was all out of ""whack"". The flow, the acting, it was just in pieces. Though people find ""Mark Wahlberg"" to be an awesome actor, which I have enjoyed his pieces before this, he fell short. His mission to accomplish the personality of an uptight driven cop became this spastic waste of screen time. I am a fan of him but this was a waste of his talent. One could tell in the action scenes that is what he is meant to do, that is where he excels. But when he would try and be funny, it made me get aggravated because I felt it to be to forced. When I complained this to my company I was with, they believe that is was made the movie so funny, but the humor has no substance if it is idiotic and choppy. The flow was totally interrupted every time Wahlberg little bits would come in and it would make all the scenes diminish from what they could have been. Now I am not blaming Wahlberg's acting on this, I am blaming the directors and all those who saw this going down, and actually thought it was a good thing. Most people want to try new things and step out of their safety zones but this was too far out and it just did not fit.One movie that this one could have taken notes from is ""Superbad"". I feel like their characters made the movie because they were awkward, and played into their roles as awkward people. McLovin was on of the most awkward characters especially when at party and around girls, but he pulls it off. His nerdy-ness was used for the better in that movie. That makes me believe that Wahlberg's hard ass personality should have been worked in better. Though it was present it was tainted by making him look a little psychotic. Will Ferrell has never had a problem making people laugh and its because he embraces how he is funny, with awkward situational, sometimes physical humor. That is something that Wahlberg did not have or did not do, or was not intended to do.

In this film Ferrell plays Allen Gamble, a cop who avoids police missions because he wants a secure job after being a pimp in college. He shares a desk with Mark Wahlberg who plays Terry,a cop who was once the future of the NYPD until he shot Derek Jeter (great cameo by Jeter) by mistake when on duty outside Yankee Stadium. When two famous cops (Samuel Jackson and Dwayne Johnson) die on a mission 2 jobs as hands on officers are open. Terry convinces Allen to go on a mission and while they are on the scene of a crime Allen recognizes David Ershon (Steve Coogan),a man who Allen knows has committed a violation. Allen arrests Ershon but Ershon pays his fine and leaves the police station. While at first Terry rejects Allens desire to hunt down Ershon again for some violations that Ershon committed, after being after being convinced by Allen to come with him Terry realizes how deep Ershon is into crime. What Terry first thought was a stupid mission turns out to be much more then it seems. Ferrel is hilarious giving a great quirky performance. He is funny without being annoying. Watching this movie will make you want to watch more movies in Ferrel's riotously funny catalog of movies. Wahlberg is kind of annoying because he is so bitter throughout the film but you still find yourself rooting for him. Coogan does a decent job but also verges on irritating at times.

Maybe these people have a point. It's a classic good-cop, bad-cop scenario. The duo's boss pulls them off the case but they strive to uncover the truth. Nothing special. But if you're like me, then you'll take the storyline for what it is: it merely exists in the movie to give Adam McKay somewhere and something upon which to scatter some truly hilarious moments; ridiculously laughable scenarios and a few one-liners that you'll be quoting with your friends for some time.Mark Wahlberg, who stars as Ferrell's partner is funny at times but there were a few cringe worthy lines from him. The scene that sticks out for me is when he meets Allen Gamble's (Will Ferrell) wife.

Whizzy graphics illustrate the extent to which corporate greed has raped the American economy. It's powerful stuff.

Yes, this is another cop movie pairing ill-matching detectives who learn to buddy up and bust bad guys together. Of course the odd-couple dynamic throws up laughs galore. But the real treat of The Other Guys is in its subtle variations, in its pursuit of the unexpected.The titular guys are Detectives Gamble and Hoitz, black sheep of the precinct who somehow never get to go out on a case. Not like Detectives Danson and Highsmith (Dwayne Johnson and Samuel L Jackson), whom we meet in medias res on a high-speed multi-vehicular chase sequence which pleasingly sends up all the daftest tropes of the cinematic action cop. These guys are heroes, but they are also very dumb heroes. It's still a shock when they test their indestructibility once too often by throwing themselves off the top of a building in pursuit of thieves who have taken the smarter route down via a zipwire.Into the freshly made vacancy Gamble (Ferrell) is perfectly happy not to step: a desk-bound scourge of white-collar felons, he'll take the paper chase over the car chase every time. ""Go get 'em, guys!"" he hollers from his swivel chair as cops with bigger balls head out into the mean streets. ""Lot of energy, lot of focus!"" Hoitz has been paired with Gamble as a punishment for mistakenly using his firearm on a sporting hero. Result: he's packing a lot of pent-up aggression inside the compact form of Mark Wahlberg. It doesn't help that he's romantically luckless, while Hoitz in his prissy white shirt and prim specs, not to mention his penchant for flaccid MoR, unwittingly exerts a wild pheromonal pull on beautiful women, above all his preposterously gorgeous and servile wife (Eve Mendes, being a very good sport in a lowcut top).The only way Hoitz can drag his partner, who has had his weapon confiscated, out on a job is to pull a gun on him. The job turns out to float Gamble's boat when they accidentally bump into a British financier (Steve Coogan) wanted for a series of unpermitted scaffolding violations. Forcibly required to hand him over to a private security detail, and told to drop the whole thing by their superior office (Michael Keaton), they smell a rat.And we can pretty much leave the plot there. It's much the least interesting thing about The Other Guys, the pleasures of which lurk in unlooked-for corners... for more check out theartsdesk.com",The Other Guys

It seems like a long string of comics are perfecting the ""wounded"" look (I blame Hugh Grant ), however they are subtitling it without any humor!! just standing there looking dumb , bewildered and misunderstood when they do something stupid ..do your job write a script instead",The Other Guys

Maybe it got better, but it seemed to be heading in the opposite direction (from a high point of dire). What gets me is that it's got a higher review rating than (say) Made in Dagenham. Does that mean that the average IMDb reviewer is completely lacking in any critical facility, and is happy to watch any pap as long as there are a few explosions and car crashes? That would explain why we get this kind of American drivel week after week, when good indie / world cinema films can't get a release. OK, you can stop reading now, it doesn't take long to slag off a film, but apparently I have to submit a review of at least ten lines...What a waste of money and (alleged) talent.",The Other Guys

381,ivss_xx,Aim for the bushes!,10,20 January 2014,"Of course, it's silly to rate a movie like this with 10 stars. Nothing is perfect, and it would not be appropriate to say that by giving it a ten stars I'm putting this in the ""Greatest movies of all time"" basket or insisting that everyone should put this in their watch-list ASAP.I'm not a movie critic, my rating merely represents how much did I enjoy watching this film. I am not in a position to judge acting, any plot flaws, script faults of quality of cinematography. Actually, if there were any bad things, they didn't disturb my experience. I thoroughly enjoyed watching it.There were a lot of weird scenes, which came at you from nowhere. For example, the bar scene where Gamble and Hoitz were talking and Gamble randomly sung a random song. A tons of scenes like these. And, i guess, that is what made this movie so great in my eyes. Without all the randomness and oddities, this would be just another cop-comedy. Not that they give the film any deeper meaning or help make the story more interesting, they just made the movie to stand out from the ordinary, maybe break some stereotypes.I like Wahlberg but can't say the same for Ferrell, but, in ""The Other Guys"" Ferrells' character really fits in.So, everyone should put this in their watch-list ASAP :D",The Other Guys
382,middletonduff,The Other Guys,7,9 March 2012,"With a cast like this,there will be something for everyone. If you're looking for a serious gripping plot with an end game, forget this. Indeed the producers did a great job with the trailer, as, it perhaps has the best bits of the film in it. That said, there are some genuinely laugh out lines here to keep you amused. Will Ferrell has a knack of creating these over the top characters, sometimes to the point of making you cringe. But I would let this film wash over you, there are some great ideas here, but do leave you thinking ""I wish they could of expanded that idea.""The Other Guys won't win any awards, but it wont offend either.",The Other Guys

You could spot the supposedly funny lines coming from about a mile away.I should have listened to my inner voice which said that Farrell is so overrated.Take an uptight guy, throw in a loose canon partner with the obligatory out of his league wife, mix it up and presto instant comedy.Been done TOO many times now.He is a one trick pony who appears to make up his dialogue as he goes along and don't get me started on Wallberg, he is so wooden I thought someone threw a chair into his scenes.If you enjoy childish humour, then this is movie for you.As for me and wife, we spared ourselves anymore of this drivel and walked out 30 minutes in.",The Other Guys
384,doobydoobydood,For Meatheads,1,25 November 2010,"This is by far the worst movie I have ever sat through. Now I generally like Will Ferrell. Oldschool, Elf, Zoolander, Starsky and Hutch, Stepbrothers... these are all funny movies. The Other Guys, on the other hand, is just NOT FUNNY. AT ALL. Is it funny to complain about driving in a Prius?.. wait, and the complaint is that it makes Marky Mark feel like he's riding in a vagina? This is a joke people. A joke I don't get. Personally, as a straight male I find a woman's vagina a pleasant place to spend time, and I also enjoy getting excellent gas mileage. And then there's the running joke about how hot Will Ferrell's wife is. Mark Wahlberg's ""macho"" character can't understand how Will Ferrell's ""sensitive"" character could attract such a beautiful woman. Have the writers of this script actually ever had a relationship with a woman? I guess all those people who are afraid of fuel efficient cars and men in touch with their emotions need something to laugh at -even if it's not funny. I actually left the theatre feeling dumber than when I walked in. At least I didn't pay to see this. Ugh.",The Other Guys
385,sonnymckinney,Rated 6.7? No way!,1,16 December 2010,"I didn't find any humor at all in this movie. Much like most of the recent Will Ferrell movies. The first part of the movie was OK...but less than halfway through...I started to lose interest. Maybe my expectation for the movie was too high. My favorite movies are comedies...and I really like some of the old Will Ferrel movies. Personally, I would have enjoyed watching ""Old School"" again instead of watching ""The Other Guys"". I could watch ""Old School"" every day-ha ha. This one is not funny and I highly recommend that you skip it.Mark Wahlberg did a great job in the movie. I'm a fan of many of his movies also. He can play many different roles. This movie has a rating of 6.7...not sure how it got such a high rating but I think that a 3 is a little bit more of an accurate rating!",The Other Guys
386,drtweak-928-886482,Entertaining Action Comedy... but the End Credits???,6,19 December 2010,"The Other Guys opens with its narrator Ice T introducing the hook-you characters, super-cops Samuel L Jackson and Dwayne Johnson as NYPD officers Highsmith and Danson. With their witty banter and a hot '70's Chevelle SS they manage to fly said vehicle into a tour bus in pursuit of criminals. With the Chevelle skewering the middle of the bus, Danson somehow takes over as bus driver and with a flip sideways launches the bus and the once-again airborne Chevy into the path of the criminals and their SUV. Of course Highsmith is still in the Chevelle and he is firing two guns through the disintegrated windshield at the gunmen as his vehicle crashes over the SUV and into a building. It's quite the elaborate stunt, but a waste of a nice vintage Chevy and ultimately costs the City of NY $12 million dollars in damages. Despite the negatives everyone at the press conference cheers because Danson mentions ""New York City"" and a hot-dog street vendor offers free hot dogs for life.Shortly thereafter, the super-cop duo finds themselves on the roof of a tall building looking down in pursuit of other criminals who had just robbed a jewelry store. Unfortunately the crooks had just severed the zip line they used to descend to street level for a quick getaway. Undaunted, our heroes run to the building's edge and leap off hoping to land on some shrubbery that is apparently not there.Following some shenanigans at the funeral, the deaths of Highsmith and Danson lead to an opening for the other guys, a new super-cop team, and misfit Detectives Terry Hoitz (Mark Wahlberg) and Allen Gamble (Will Ferrell) eventually fill that role. At first, Gamble, a somewhat naive forensic accountant, is quite content to do the paperwork but very reluctantly gets roped into doing actual police work by his spirited and angry partner Hoitz who rants that he's a peacock who must be allowed to fly! Wahlberg's character Terry Hoitz was assigned to desk duty for having shot Derek Jeter in the leg during the 7th game of the World Series where he worked the security tunnel, hence his co-workers gave him copious grief and dubbed him ""The Yankee Clipper."" It is obvious from the get-go that Hoitz hates his partner Gamble and tells him so in no uncertain words. The pair also gets into a metaphorical lion vs. tuna debate, which Hoitz loses and then proceeds to dump hot coffee on Gamble's chest.The Police Captain, Gene Mauch (Michael Keaton) acts like a referee keeping order amongst his joke cracking staff. Mauch works a second job as a manager at Bed Bath and Beyond to put his bisexual son through college. His character lends a bit of sense and stability to this somewhat chaotic action comedy.The plot revolves around Lendl Global Consortium, whose head consorter and CEO is David Ershon played by the semi-likable Steve Coogan. Ershon and Lendl Global are having no trouble losing big money provided by all sorts of domestic and foreign investors. But Ershon has big plans about where to get the money to pay his investors back with interest. Of course all this is highly illegal and that's where our new super-cops come in.The Other Guys contains some very comedic car chases with Allen Gamble's red Prius serving up the laughs. Furthermore, Gamble's Prius is violated more than once by Dirty Mike and his pals who debauch the Prius using it as their own portable love shack.Eva Mendes plays Dr. Sheila Gamble, Allen's wife. There is a humorous scene when Allen brings his partner home for dinner and introduces the sexy Sheila as his ""old ball & chain."" Hoitz's reaction is something like ""No—who is it really!"" Allen proceeds to belittle his wife with other degrading cliché comments to Hoitz's befuddlement as Sheila just grins and laughs it off.Overall I found The Other Guys quite funny and entertaining. It contains some slapstick but is not as sophomoric as some of Ferrell's previous films like Blades of Glory, or Talladega Nights: The Ballad of Ricky Bobby. The dialog and comedic set-ups are a notch up from Ferrell's previous efforts in my view. That said be warned that crude sexual references and language abound.The bottom line is The Other Guys is an entertaining film and worth watching. I give it 3.2 out of 5 stars but I do have one bone to pick. In the closing credits, facts about recent financial troubles in the USA are graphically illustrated in color. We are shown what a Ponzi scheme is and told that the Madoff/AIG bailouts cost taxpayers (you and me) 883 billion dollars. According to the graphs this amounts to $2,258 for every man, woman, and child in the US. Further, after AIG and the banks were bailed out, the 73 top executives received a total of 1.2 billion dollars in bonuses from the bailout funds. If that were not enough, the average yearly income for top financial executives rose to 11.8 million dollars over the past decade. And the ratio of the CEO's salary to that of average employees was shown as 319 to 1.I'm not sure what the film-maker's motives were for this blatant display of financial abuses as it was not directly related to the movie. But it did wipe the smile off my face.",The Other Guys
387,malcolm-46,Yawn!,2,14 February 2011,"This film was recommended to me by a film buff who likes Art-house and Foreign films. So I thought if he loves this Hollywood comedy....it must be really good. It also looked promising because it had a great cast who should at least make me chuckle now & again. But I will now sceptical about his recommendations after watching The Other Guys. I must admit the first 10-15 minutes of the film are quite funny with Samuel L. Jackson and The Rock hamming it up as action macho cops who take all the praise and adoration from the New York public. Then they die and it all goes downhill from there. No plot, no dialogue, no chemistry and not funny at all....Yawn!",The Other Guys
388,kenbarrow,Boring and seriously UN funny - Don't watch,1,16 January 2011,"After reading some of the reviews on this film - I'm beginning to wonder how anyone can say that this film was hilarious. All I can think of is that they said that just because, maybe, like me, that sat through this pile of rubbish and wanted to get their own back on people.I've watched 1000's of films, and believe me, I couldn't wait till this thing was over. Not funny at all, and worse still, the constant dialogue was just non-sensical verbal diarrhoea and extremely boring. Even my 12 year old grandson, who normally laughs at silly stuff, said the film was rubbish.ALso, with a star cast like this, they all must have been hard up for cash. Now I know why Samuel L Jackson and Dwayne Johnson made such an early exit out this film, like after 10 minutes or so they are gone. No Wonder !!!! I'm just hoping that I can give this zero star rating because 1 star is too much.BE WARNED - THIS IS BORING UNFUNNY CRAP !!!!",The Other Guys

But you need to like the dry humor to love the movie...Actually, you need to see the film twice if you want to get all the jokes. For example: Every woman like Will Ferrel. And all of his girlfriends are hot. But you only find this out when you see his wife. By that time other jokes with hot woman are made already. It's so dry that jokes you will see in Talladega nights and the wedding crasher repeat themselves in a new kind of way. And if you love that kind of humor: definitely watch this one!! It's maybe the best in it's kind. If you don't like this humor. please don't watch it, and please don't tell this movie IS not good, but you don't like the humor...

Unfortunately there were no laughs in the movie.You'd think with Will Ferrell, Michael Keaton, Steve Coogan and Samuel Jackson the performances would be good but they're not. Wahlberg is as bland as ever. Even Ray Stevenson, an actor I normally like, is poor in this.Its supposed to be funny that Ferrell's character is surrounded by super sexy women who can't resist him.

391,Pbunyi,Hilarious!,9,20 April 2011,I watched it without knowing any plot or storyline and I thought it was hilarious! The dialogue was random and will Ferrell killed it. The whole cast provided a well rounded movie. Yes the storyline was sort of on the weak side but the humor was enough to support it. Mark wahlberg performed well for someone I'm used to having somewhat serious movies. The two complimented each other in some weird way. Maybe because they weren't in the same type of movies before. The other characters had their own humor to add: Michael Keaton as the captain quoting tlc songs? Martin and fosse blurbs? The British billionaire guy (forgot his name)?

Will Ferrell always does rubbish films and this is another one to add to the list. Mark Wahlberg shouts for pretty much all of the film..this led me to turning the TV down but I could still hear him shouting which was stupid. Hated it. Plus none of the film even goes anywhere! One part was very rude at one point and I felt very uncomfortable watching it and no mother or father would want their small child hearing that sort of language for a film rated PG-13. Im 3 years older than that and even I didn't want to hear it.. Very unimpressed with it and glad it was only on a DVD rental and I didn't waste my money buying the rubishness and wasting money on it in the cinema.

Mark and Will we're the perfect actors for their roles. In my opinion there was nothing bad about this movie. Just one thing, I don't understand why the two detectives decided to jump down from that building saying ""aim for the bushes"". That part of the movie had me confused. Other than that, the movie was excellent. The plot can get confusing but if you've watched it a million times like I have then you'd get it like nothing.

Jackson and Dwayne Johnson are in the film a bit as the head cops; like a newer Starsky and Hutch. They were entertaining. Eva Mendes plays Ferrell's wife and she is actually entertaining. Then the chief of the police station is played by Michael Keaton. Throughout the movie he kept quoting from the group TLC. He was actually also pretty funny. You will find yourself laughing a lot throughout the film. But there are some parts where they do try to be serious and most of the time it can be a turn off in a good comedy. There are some great one liners and scenes that will stick in your mind. So a pretty good comedy and I will end by saying, I want to see Mark Mahlberg do more comedic roles, because he is pretty good in them.",The Other Guys
398,gandalfwhire,"Formulaic, immature, boring.",3,18 July 2012,"I re-watched this movie yesterday and while it did make me laugh a couple of times, I still think it was an awful mess of a movie. Even for a mindless fun kind of movie. The plot was generic Hollywood buddy-buddy formula, but with some (not funny at all) twists to make it less been- there-done-that. Most of those twists are about Will Ferrell's character, even though there's one made with Wahlberg's character too. Those twists, contrary to the intention were the thing that made this movie really awful and a hot mess if there ever was one. It seemed like genre-wise it tried to be many things, a comedy, a moral story (the financial fraud part of it), and a good action movie. For me it failed on all three fronts. Comedy - tried too hard, the end result was more OMG what are they trying to do, this is not how you reinvent the genre! Also, the sexist ""jokes"" by mostly Wahlberg's character (also the weird treatment of Eva Mendes' character by Will Ferrell's character ) made it even worse for me. Moral story - seemed like an unnecessary part of the movie, but they went there. For the f... of it I guess? Action movie - The over the top Samuel L. Jackson & The Rock scenes were pretty rad, but then the movie started going in many different directions genre-wise so it was hard to watch it as an action flick, it seemed more like a mish-mash of different genre sketches. The main characters were not that bad per se, they were amusing enough, but nothing new, especially Will Ferrell's. He could've been from any other of his movies. Mark Wahlberg's character was typical rage filled cop with additional helping of sexist jokes, Wahlberg himself seemed kinda wooden. Maybe he's just not meant for comedy roles. Anyway, I gave this movie a 3 because I feel like it did nothing for the genre, it was immature and I mean in ""Poop jokes are the best! Let's make more poop jokes!"" kind of way. I guess that was the demographic this movie tried to pander to: people who think poop jokes are awesome.",The Other Guys

As for Michael Keaton, very charming and engaging, practically irresistible to me. Love the references to the song lyrics and the pretended innocence of such.

406,sarahheitzman,The Other Guys,8,24 September 2013,"After Highsmith and Danson--New York City's hottest and best detectives--fall to their deaths during a rooftop chase, two positions open up to be the top cop. From surviving car chases to escaping exploding buildings and shootings, Allen Gamble and Terry Hoitz stick together as partners and attempt to become the city's new heroes. ""The Other Guys"" is a hilarious movie thanks to the acting skills of Will Ferrell and Mark Wahlberg, the cinematography of Oliver Wood, and the wonderful direction by Adam McKay. Will Ferrell is one of the best comic actors of all time. In this movie, Will Ferrell's character, Allen, is known as the desk jockey; he enjoys doing each case's paperwork. The 2011 AFI Movie of the Year winner, Mark Wahlberg, plays Terry, Allen's partner. He knows what it's like to be the hot shot and wishes to move up the ladder of detectives to that point again. Wahlberg does a fantastic job with expressing Terry's deliberate, yet hysterical efforts to become a great cop. After getting a dispatch that there's a robbery at a jewelry store, Terry wants to go to the scene, but his partner doesn't want to leave. Before stomping out of the room, Terry exclaims, ""You've gotta be shitting me, you can't keep me cooped up in here. I am a peacock, you gotta let me fly!"" Will Ferrell's experience with awkwardness makes Allen's situations on the field absolutely hilarious. While racing to a crime scene to get there before two other detectives, Terry yells, ""Allen punch that accelerator or I will shoot you in the foot!"" Allen does so and screams, ""AMERICA!"" Later, he explains that before he's never actually put his foot all the way down to the ground with the accelerator, but he feels slightly aroused. Not only that, but he runs over the crime scene. The contrast between one partner wanting to say in the office and the other wanting experience on the field creates the funniest bickers and arguments between two grown men. The cinematographer, Oliver Wood, does a phenomenal job at catching each scene at the right angle. A few of the films he has worked for are a few of the Bourne movies, Step Brothers, Freaky Friday, and the upcoming Anchorman 2. Within the first scene of the movie, you are pulled into the action of a car chase in downtown New York City. You get a view from on top of the cars, within, in the sky, and out on the sidewalks. The variety of focus in each scene keeps your eyes interested in what's happening on the screen.Adam McKay is the director of this film. He has had experience within the comedy genre, for he also directed Anchorman, Step Brothers, and Talladega Nights: The Ballad of Ricky Bobby. Typically in comedies, people want humor that is created by exaggerating real life experiences, as well as a happy ending. With ""The Other Guys"", that is exactly what McKay gives the audience. He takes the life of an average New York City cop and makes fun with it by adding exaggerated competition between detectives, cases that intertwine and connect to others, and separate histories of Allen and Terry's lives, which helps us understand why they act out of the ordinary.""The Other Guys"" is an action-comedy film that was created to excite and entertain. There is no doubt that this movie will get you to laugh and leave wanting to look up quotes With the combination of humor and conflict, this movie is the exciting story of Terry Hoitz and Allen Gamble taking on New York City's scams, drugs, sex crimes, and violence.",The Other Guys

408,magspatty,The Funniest Movie Ever,9,16 October 2014,"Wahlberg and Ferrell are two desk jockeys about to make it big time- kind of. While they dream of becoming the sharp shooting, car chasing cops they idolize, they end up busting a financial scam. Both of the main characters are funny as hell, but in more of a straight-man way. Allen Gamble isn't Ron Burgundy- because Allen Gamble actually has some sense to him. They're smart characters. This isn't anything like Anchorman. Allen is actually a genius, with minimal street sense (see his ""Lion vs Tuna monologue). Terry isn't the brightest bulb on the box, but he is like a Sour Patch Kid- sour then sweet. Both actors give memorable performances. The supporting cast is great as well- Steve Coogan, Michael Keaton, Eva Mendes, Dwayne Johnson, Sam Jackson, and in my opinion, Rob Riggle and Damon Wayans. Riggle and Wayans play two 'rival' cops who also idolize the rough n tough Danson (Johnson) and Highsmith (Jackson). Their ""desk pop"" prank is one of the funniest scenes I've ever seen. People say it's a spoof- but it's more of a ""Christmas Vacation"" than it is a ""Scary Movie""- a lampoon, if you will, of action films. It is actually a very good piece of film. It's well written (what else do you expect from McKay though?) and it looks really, really good. The action is well done. The way the film plays out is great as well- props to the editors. Very well directed, and combined with one hell of a script, The Other Guys is not to be missed.",The Other Guys
409,sr-bouwknegt,One of the best comedy films I've ever watched,9,2 May 2021,"After more than ten years, this still gives me a big smile on my face. Even just thinking of it makes me laugh. I highly recommend for you to watch this movie!",The Other Guys
410,himanshu-watchlist,Don't remember when i watched something as funny as this movie,9,11 September 2021,"Honest review, this is one of the best funniest movie I have seen, from taking care of emotions and laughter all along, a great movie to watch.",The Other Guys
411,jaspervanstrien,"Not funny, at all",1,12 September 2018,"No clue why this one gets a 7/10 rating from so many people.. It just isn't funny. A bad storyline coupled with over the top sexist 'jokes' and so-so acting doesn't make a good movie.
Best part of the movie: the credits with 'fun' facts on capitalism. 
But best to not sit this one out to wait for the credits at all.",The Other Guys

413,hanksperry,Not Bad But Not Great,5,18 March 2020,"I admit, Will Ferrell's brand of comedy isn't my favorite, so if you're a fan you will probably like this movie.",The Other Guys
414,edwardosmith,Disappointingly Unfunny,2,29 September 2010,"I went to see this movie based on some of glowing the reviews on this website. I was expecting something funny, and had high hopes. Unfortunately the ""unparallelled chemistry"" between Marky Mark and Will Ferrell turned out to be bad chemistry - unparallelled, to be sure, and I knew ten minutes in that it would be a weak show, at best. I sat through the rest of it, and it was definitely weak. All of Wahlberg's lines seemed strained. Ferrell played himself, as usual, being the annoying partner that takes every joke so far so that it's no longer funny. Wahlberg played his easily set-off counterpart that freaks out at Farrell every time Ferrell speaks. Bad acting, boring plot, impossible to get into, and therefore a complete waste of time. The Rock and Samuel Jackson were pretty funny, so there's your two stars out of ten. I recommend to avoid this one folks.",The Other Guys
415,comedianhir,Cop Movie,10,7 February 2020,I don't think anything is perfect. Yet this movie might be the perfect cop movie. It doesn't take itself seriously and that's what makes it great. Please watch. This film is criminally underrated,The Other Guys
416,Sammillner89,Hilarious from the start,9,26 December 2018,It is quite honestly one of my favourite films - its just plain funny - a bit like Anchor Man humour if that's your thing!,The Other Guys
417,MissLee13,Laughs at all ages!!,9,9 August 2010,"I saw the film with my 60-year-old mom and my teenage son and we all cracked up throughout the film--sometimes at different things and to different degrees. That's touching a true cross-section!! Although the latter 1/3 of the movie isn't quite as funny as the first 2/3, it still brought the laughs. I can't imagine why anyone who enjoyed Will Ferrell in Anchorman, Talladega Nights, and Step Brothers would give this movie anything below 7 stars. Maybe the reviewer who said that everyone didn't get the comic references was on to something...although I can't imagine why people wouldn't. There are humorous references about modern technology, sports, pimpin', geriatrics, !! Who can't find something in one of those to laugh at?!? lol I say DEFINITELY check it out for yourself! I needed a good laugh and I got one...even some true tears of laughter.",The Other Guys
418,wilson1-2,One of the Worst,4,26 October 2010,"Actually the first 20 minutes is great. But they must have used all of their best stuff at the beginning because the rest is like a bad Saturday Night Live, they keep tossing out the skits but only one of ten is funny. They actually totally leave the plot for half of the movie. They are trying to solve a crime but that notion leaves the set as they run around trying to work in every possible set-up that two buddy cops could have in their personal and professional lives. I've got a feeling that if you are the kind of person who loves to watch Die Hard movies over and over again, then you'll probably think the insanity in this movie is funny. But as for myself and my partner we should have left early like we almost did.",The Other Guys
