0,TheLittleSongbird,Doesn't work,1,19 February 2011,"Just for the record, I love Jurassic Park. It has a great score, great dinosaurs and is just great fun from start to finish. I like Steven Spielberg, but I did not like this movie one bit, and I feel this is his worst film. Spielberg has made some masterpieces, and he has also made some disappointing or mediocre movies, but for me The Lost World is the only time where he has hit rock bottom. It isn't just disappointing or mediocre, it is pretty darn bad.The only redeeming qualities were the score, well it is John Williams what do you expect, and the dinosaurs, they look wonderful despite the fact we have seen most of them before. The scenery and cinematography were very good too, but not as good as that in the original, lacking its polish.What really brought the film down was the script and story. The script is just terrible, when it tries to be funny it is actually unfunny and predictable while there is too much mugging on Jeff Goldblum's part. The story is pretty redundant, not the idea but in the way it was executed. There is too much filler that could have been trimmed or excised, as some of is superfluous to the story and just bogs it down significantly. The rest of the story is predictable, is filled with plot holes and lacks any thrills, focusing less on suspense and more on action. The film is also overlong, drags due to those aforementioned fillers primarily and feels rather anti-climatic. Spielberg's direction is disappointingly lethargic, almost as if he wasn't interested, while the film is devoid of a single likable or sympathetic character, apart from one and he was killed off early. Kelly and Vince Vaughn's character especially are irritating. The acting is poor, Goldblum is a great actor with good material, but seeing as his material is actually awful he tries his best but it is all wasted effort by the end. The rest of the cast including Julianne Moore and the late Pete Postlethwaite try too but the script and how badly written their characters are undermine them to the point they struggle too.All in all, a huge disappointment and just didn't work. I can understand the disappointment of fans of the original, and I have heard valid criticisms of this film which I agree with. I also agree if you compare this in any way to the original, this movie is doomed, but any comparison is inevitable. As a sequel, it is not the worst, it isn't quite as awful as Home Alone 4, NeverEnding Story 3, Secret of NIMH 2, Son of the Mask and Jaws:The Revenge(Superbabies:Baby Geniuses 2 is also terrible but unlike the above its predecessor is bad as well), but to me The Lost World is one of the more disappointing ones. 1/10 for the score and the dinosaurs.

1,bkoganbing,Dinosaur breeding ground,6,27 July 2016,"In The Lord World: Jurassic Park we learn that after the disaster of the Jurassic Park dinosaur theme park developed by Richard Attenborough, there's been a palace coup in his conglomerate. Pete Postelthwaite his greedy nephew has taken over and they want to exploit another island which was used as a breeding ground. So Attenborough assembles a team to stop them including Jeff Goldblum from the original film and Dian Fossey like naturalist Julianne Moore.It's a well equipped military expedition that Postelthwaite mounts to go to that second island. But if you think that makes a difference to the dinosaurs, it's another think coming you have. For both heroes and villains there is enough heart stopping action for 3 Indiana Jones films.Jeff Goldblum has polished up his wry, ironic character to such a degree one can see the beginnings of Detective Zack Nichols from Criminal Intent in this film. Vince Vaughn has a nice turn as a Greenpeace activist on the Attenborough team.Directed once again by Steven Spielberg The Lost World: Jurassic Park is not as good as the original, but miles better than the third dinosaur incarnation in this series. The last part of the film takes place in San Diego where a live specimen of T-Rex has been brought back for exhibit. All I can say is that someone watched both King Kong and Gorgo for the result is a combination of both those films.Two pretty good ones I'd say.",The Lost World - Jurassic Park
2,Leofwine_draca,Spielberg's sequel failure,4,19 August 2016,"I'm a big fan of dinosaur movies, whether they be stop motion creatures, man-in-a-rubber-suit fun fests or computer generated terrors. Sadly, THE LOST WORLD is not one of the best dinosaur films around. It's not even very entertaining. It only took Spielberg four years to churn out a sequel to his huge 1993 hit JURASSIC PARK, which really took special effects technology one step further in the world and along with TERMINATOR 2, contains effects which are truly wondrous when first seen.Unfortunately, by 1997, these kind of special effects were old hat and therefore the wonder was gone. Gone too was the charm and magic we used to associate with Spielberg's films, leaving me with a cold feeling of cynical marketing. THE LOST WORLD is simply a rehash of the first film, but without the plot and clever bits. It's a bit like a roller coaster ride in a thunderstorm, it's exciting at the time but it leaves you feeling ill afterwards due to the insubstantial nature of the movie. For it fell into the trap of letting the special effects flourish at the expense of any wit, characterisation, or plot, much like MEN IN BLACK, VOLCANO, and countless other recent 'blockbusters' have.I'm not criticising the special effects, as they are as brilliant as ever, but as we've already seen them all before there's not much to get excited about. The actors and actresses in the film are all accomplished but are not given much to do. Jeff Goldblum looks tired and old and as if he wants to be somewhere else, while Julianne Moore is one of the most annoying heroines I have ever seen (almost as bad as Penelope Anne Miller in THE RELIC). Vince Vaughan is bland and expressionless in his worthless part while Richard Attenborough puts in a cameo appearance and looks like he was glad to leave. The only acting of note in the film is that from Pete Postlethwaite as a big game hunter who wants to bag the biggest game of all, i.e. the Tyrannosaurus rex. With his big hat and powerful gun he's clichéd and a lot of fun in his sadly small role.There are a lot of things to laugh at in the film. Sadly, they're not intentional laughs, instead you will find yourself ridiculing the events taking place. Ian Malcolm, a white character, has a black daughter. Excuse me? I'm not one to take the mickey but I find this a rather unlikely example of tokenism done perhaps in response to the lack of black leading characters in the original. One set piece of the film is a moment where a caravan falls over the edge of the cliff (a rehash of the car over the cliff scene in JURASSIC PARK). It lasts for so long that it soon gets very boring - and stupid - indeed.The only thing of interest in the film is the increased violence level, which somewhat controversially gave the film a 12 certificate in the UK. One man is ripped apart by tiny dinosaurs, a girl dies in the opening credits, and in the best bit of the film, a man is torn in half by two Tyrannosaurus rex. These sadistic streaks are totally out of the blue and obviously in my case the best bits of the film. Otherwise, get out the original for some really fun dinosaur escapades.",The Lost World - Jurassic Park
3,SnoopyStyle,The ride is still fun,7,2 January 2014,"It's 4 years after the first movie. News of the Jurassic Park have been scrub and misinformation planted. Ian Malcolm (Jeff Goldblum) has been discredited. There is a 2nd island 'Site B' where dinosaurs are free to roam. John Hammond lost control of his company after a family got attacked on the island. His nephew Peter Ludlow (Arliss Howard) took over intent on exploiting the island. Hammond sends experts of his own to get good PR for his secret island before it becomes public. Malcolm's girlfriend Sarah Harding (Julianne Moore) is already there, and Malcolm decide to go to convince her to return.Spielberg has the touch to create a good thrill ride. But this is just a sequel that contributes nothing new to the franchise. He gets the dinosaurs on screen right away, and it doesn't really stop. The action is a little bit more intense. Goldblum returns to give a bit of continuity. But this is nothing more than a fun amusement park ride.",The Lost World - Jurassic Park
4,Hitchcoc,"Good Sequel, but Lacking the Wonder of the First",8,30 December 2016,"The first thing I think of when I hear ""Lost World"" is the Wallace Beery silent film where a dinosaur is brought to New York City. It is a Sauropod of some kind (which looks like it's made out of clay) which was not a carnivore, but no one really knew about these creatures, so they bought into it. This has the same basic premise in that it seems that it would be marketable (like in King Kong) to bring a dinosaur to the States. Unfortunately, these creatures are not lap dogs, let loose in the back yard. As is always the case in these kinds of movies, the security arrangements are totally inadequate. Eventually, San Diego becomes a breakfast buffet. Yes, there are lots of action sequences and the dinosaurs are magnificent, but it doesn't lack the storytelling that the original had. The science is not an issue; chaos theory is not an issue. This is a monster movie, much like the wonderful ""Beast from 20,000 Fathoms."" It's about destruction and death and devastation. So it out-Godzillas Godzilla with better buildings, but the plot's the same. Still, it's non-stop adventure.",The Lost World - Jurassic Park
5,mark.waltz,It's obvious who's going to end up as a T-Rex toothpick from the very start.,7,4 February 2020,"And you can put money on it and have a sure thing. This first follow-up to the 1993 smash hit is quite enjoyable, and you can see why Spielberg gave it the go ahead. Richard Attenborough returns briefly to tell Jeff Goldblum, the only lead returnee, that there's a secret island where dinosaurs are free to roam without people as snacks or as pebbles under their big feet. As the film opens, the audience witnesses a little girl ends up as a buffet for some dozen carnivorous puppy sized dino's, a creepy opening that really goes nowhere, showing some idle rich cruising the wrong island. Attenborough sends Goldblum there to gather photographic evidence where he runs into his estranged wife (Julianne Moore) who abandoned him and their adopted daughter (Vanessa Chester). The military breaks in with the intention of unleashing the dangerous dinosaurs on their enemies and this ends up with a T-Rex terrorizing San Diego!There's at least several evil humans whom the audience can't wait to see the T-Rex teeth up close, people so vile that the audience would often applaud as they felt their last moments alive vibrating the ground right in front of them. Moore and Goldblum are obviously the decent humans, fixing the broken leg of a baby T-Rex, and it's obvious that this won't be like the grateful lion who allowed the monkey to remove a thorn from its foot and didn't eat it.
When mommy arrives, it's obvious that she's not going to stop to ask questions even though Moore can tell that she isn't hungry, just lonely for baby. But what happens afterwards indicates that this mommy is as furious as the alien who terrorized Sigourney Weaver and every bit as determined to get revenge.Yes, this is just as filled with tension as the first film with several scenes putting Goldblum, Moore and the gymnastics trained Chester in peril. At times, the dialogue is silly and inappropriate, showing that sardonic humor doesn't always work. This does continue the graphic deaths of some characters, one literally torn in two before swallowed. Much deserving of a delicious death, Peter Stormare , gets pleasure from torturing the weakest of the dinosaurs and shows no compassion for those who become innocent victims. Then there's cameraman Richard Schiff whose arrogance at first makes him seem a perfect snack, but his heroism turns the table as fear takes over in his final moments. But the best crunch and munch is saved for the end as Pete Postlethwaite's leader of the exposition finds him trapped with both mother and baby and gives the audience a lot to cheer about.Moore finds out by accident that even the herbivore parents don't like their babies being messed with and nearly becomes the target for a swinging spiked tail. Don't underestimate the power of the small carnivorous dinosaurs because in large groups, their damage takes a longer time to lead to death than the big ones, and they are quite determined critters. Then there's the raptors, as bullying as ever, once again putting Moore in jeopardy, in a way that is quite funny. But their escape from the island isn't the end of the movie, and the sight of the T-Rex roaming the streets of San Diego is very funny as well. The fact that this entire neighborhood seems to sleep through the dino march is absurd. It's a great nail chewing ending however, and that makes this still a ton of fun.",The Lost World - Jurassic Park
6,classicsoncall,"""Yeah. Ooh-ah, that's how it always starts.""",7,25 January 2015,"I guess I'll have to put this one under my guilty pleasures department. I've always been a sucker for dinosaurs, and with the filming technology available today, a film like this one and it's predecessor have just the right ingredients for a fun time. Granted, there are many elements in the story here that don't make a whole lot of sense, but there's that old saying about suspending disbelief, so that's what I'm applying here.Besides all the puzzling plot elements, and you know what most of them are, here's one I picked up in an early scene. When Kelly (Vanessa Lee Chester) looks at the wall map showing 'Las Cinco Muertes', The Five Deaths, the island of Isla Sorna is at the center of that cluster. In the opening screen narrative it's stated that this island is eighty seven miles southwest of Isla Nublar, but none of the other islands on the map go by that name. So a bit of a continuity slip-up there.You know what I got a kick out of? At one point, one of the principal characters upon arriving on the island, states that the Eisenberg Uncertainty Principle is in effect, that is, it's not possible to study something without changing it. That was oddly reminiscent of the original Star Trek Prime Directive; an interesting concept but virtually impossible to maintain, because once you're there, your actions have consequences.Say, and how about that Roland (Pete Postlethwaite), is he a Nascar contender or what? Recall when the InGen team first arrive on Isla Sorna and he's driving on the jungle trails with Ludlow (Arliss Howard). I had to rewind the scene because he had his head turned completely around to Ludlow in the back seat for a full forty seconds at one point - how did he do that? Well anyway, not a lot of credibility to the picture, but how can you not marvel at the imaginative CGI work creating those magnificent dinosaurs? Stego's, T-Rex's and all those mini-predators make for a couple hours of dino fun. You don't even have to pay attention to the scientists.",The Lost World - Jurassic Park
7,gavin6942,An Adequate Follow-Up,6,14 July 2015,"A research team is sent to the Jurassic Park Site B island to study the dinosaurs there while another team approaches with another agenda.What makes this film so interesting is watching it now (2015) and recognizing all the names who were not so big when it came out. Julianne Moore was just starting out (and obviously not on top of her game), Vince Vaughn had just broken out with ""Swingers"". Peter Stormare has made a hundred movies or more, but never got big until ""Prison Break"". And yet, here they are.This is a decent movie and a decent sequel. Not great, not as clever as the first. The plot seems a little forced, but for those who want dinosaur action, it definitely provides that. I am not at all clear why Site B has species of dinosaurs that Site A apparently never did. (In the first film, it is said there are 15 species... I did not count them, but were more added here?)",The Lost World - Jurassic Park
8,lee_eisenberg,How could Spielberg do this to us?!,2,3 January 2006,"Did Steven Spielberg think that just because he won an Oscar for ""Schindler's List"" he had a blank check to do anything?! After the original ""Jurassic Park"" was so neat, ""The Lost World"" sucked. To tell you the truth, the novel wasn't very good either; it was totally predictable. The movie is just a rehash of the original.I guess that the reason that I gave this movie 2/10 stars instead of 1/10 is because this movie did make Vince Vaughn a star. He certainly does his best, as do Jeff Goldblum, Julianne Moore, and Pete Postlethwaite. But no matter what they do, they can't escape the fact that the movie is ridiculous. Dreadful.",The Lost World - Jurassic Park
9,jboothmillard,The Lost World: Jurassic Park,5,12 September 2005,"The first Jurassic Park was a big smash hit and made waves in the world of CGI special effects, it was inevitable there would be sequel, especially being based on the follow-up book, The Lost World by Michael Crichton, so director Steven Spielberg (Jaws, Raiders of the Lost Ark, E.T. the Extra- Terrestrial, Schindler's List, Saving Private Ryan) returned. Basically set four years after the events at Jurassic Park on Isla Sorna, a wealthy family are on the island of Isla Nubla, the daughter wanders off and is attacked by a pack of Compsognathus, she survives, but following this John Hammond's nephew, Peter Ludlow (Full Metal Jacket's Arliss Howard), gains control of his uncle's company, InGen. Dr. Ian Malcolm (Jeff Goldblum) is invited to meet John Hammond (Lord Sir Richard Attenborough) at his mansion, he explains that Isla Sorna is where the dinosaurs were engineered and nurtured before moving to Isla Nubla, he also explains that after the park was shut down, a hurricane allowed the dinosaurs to break free, they have been living wild ever since. Hammond requests Ian to join a team travelling to Isla Sorna to document the dinosaurs living naturally in their environment, this will also work as a way to rally public support to stop Ludlow exploiting the site, Ian initially declines, but then he learns his palaeontologist girlfriend, Sarah Harding (Julianne Moore), is one of the team, and already on the island, he sees it now as a rescue operation. Ian meets his teammates, equipment specialist and engineer Eddie Carr (Deep Impact's Richard Schiff) and video documentarian Nick Van Owen (Vince Vaughn), they arrive on the island and find Sarah, they also discover Ian's daughter Kelly Curtis (A Little Princess's Vanessa Lee Chester) has stowed away in the trailer. Soon after they see helicopters carrying vehicles, it is a second InGen team of mercenaries, hunters and palaeontologists led by Ludlow, sent to capture several dinosaurs, these are to be taken to a newly-proposed theme park in San Diego, meanwhile tracker and team leader Roland Tembo (Pete Postlethwaite) wants to capture a male Tyrannosaurus Rex, he uses its crying and injured offspring as bate. Hearing this Nick and Sarah release the caged dinosaurs to wreak havoc on InGen camp, Nick also frees the infant T. Rex, he and Sarah mend its broken leg in the trailer, Kelly is taken to shelter in the ""high hide"", Ian rushes to the trailer knowing that its parents will be searching for it, moments later the two T. Rex arrive, so they release the infant. However the adult T. Rex return to attack the trailer, pushing it over the nearby cliff, while Kelly is safe Eddie arrives and saves the others with a rope tied to a tree, however whilst in the SUV he is devoured by the T. Rex, sending the trailer, the SUV and all their equipment to fall and be destroyed, Ian, Sarah and Nick are found by the InGen team. Both groups now have no communication or vehicles, so they team up to reach the radio station on foot, on the journey, Roland's second-in- command Dieter Stark (Fargo's Peter Stormare) goes missing and is killed by a pack of Compsognathus, and during the next night the camp is panicked and flee when the female adult T. Rex arrives, Roland meanwhile manages to tranquillise the male adult. The hunters disband into the thick trees and go through a field of long grass, there the troop are attacked by Velociraptors; Ian, Sarah, Nick and Kelly continue toward the compound alone, Nick is able to find the radio, communicate and calls for help, the other three encounter a trio of Velociraptors, but manage to escape to the rescue helicopter to take them off the island, in mid-air they spot the male adult T. Rex is unconscious in a cage and ready for transport. In San Diego the freighter carrying the male adult Tyrannosaurus Rex heads for the mainland, but crashes into the dock, the entire crew are dead, the conscious T. Rex escapes and rampages the city, but Ian and Sarah get the T. Rex infant from an InGen facility and eventually lure the adult back to the ship, Ludlow trying to intervene is killed the cargo, before it can escape again the adult is tranquillised by Sarah, and Ian closes the hold. The film ends with Ian, Sarah and Kelly watching the ship carrying the adult and infant T. Rex on the news as it is escorted back to Isla Sorna, Hammond appears in a recorded interview explaining that the American and Costa Rican governments have agreed to declare the island a nature preserve, he ends by saying ""life will find a way"". Also starring Harvey Jason as Ajay Sidhu, Thomas F. Duffy as Dr. Robert Burke, Joseph Mazzello as Tim, Ariana Richards as Lex, Thomas Rosales Jr. as Carter, Mousehunt's Ian Abercrombie as Butler, Hostages' Billy Brown as InGen Worker, David Koepp as Unlucky Bastard and Eli Roth as Subway Man. Goldblum is still likeably awkward, Attenborough has his good short stint, and supporting stars Moore, Vaughn and Postlethwaite do fine as well, but once again the real stars are the dinosaurs, brought to life by great special effects and models, the story is not compelling, it feels predictable, and the T. Rex crashing through San Diego is an obvious small send up of Godzilla, but there are some engaging action moments, especially the trailer over the cliff, and T. Rex and raptor encounters, it's not a bad science-fiction adventure. It was nominated the Oscar for Best Visual Effects. Worth watching!",The Lost World - Jurassic Park
10,ccthemovieman-1,"Least Of The Three, But That's Not All Bad",7,29 March 2006,"Of the three Jurassic Park films, this was the only one I thought didn't match up to the others, but that's just my opinion. It was still entertaining and offered the normal amounts of thrills and amazing special effects.The dinosaurs are so life-like that they are always fascinating to watch. The baby T-Rex is particularly realistic in this adventure story, as are the little bird-like creatures. The story was so-so. I think a better ending would have been a shot of the big reptile in front of the San Diego skyline, which could set up the sequel of the beast loose in a big city, but the ending was still okay....just could have been better.Also, there was too much action in here. Some - not a lot - should have been cut out. At a little over two hours, the film can wear you out. Despite the above remarks, it's still a fun-scary-tense thriller and the DTS sound is superb. In fact, this is one of the best-sounding DVDs I own, and that helps make the film enjoyable.",The Lost World - Jurassic Park
11,ma-cortes,Nice sequel as thrilling and moving as the original,8,16 December 2005,"The picture starts when the billionaire John Hammond (Richard Attenborough) as Jurassic Park's curator brings again to paleontologist (Jeff Goldblum) to his home hoping to convince him for new adventure in other island of the coast of Costa Rica and where dinos were allowed mix freely and to breed . There are living dinosaurs and various prehistoric creatures genetically engineered by means of DNA cloned extracted from Jurassic animals found in mosquitoes preserved into amber from cretaceous period . At first he refuses but learning his sweetheart (Julianna Moore) is on island he heads for there , along with a specialist (Richard Schiff) and a researcher (Vince Vaughn) and his daughter who has stowed away into the van . Besides , a group of hunters (Pete Postlethwaite , Peter Stormare) and an ambitious person (Arliss Howard) arrive
in the island . In the film appears numerous predatory animals and colossal carnivores as Tyrannosaurus Rex , Velociraptors , Behemoths , Stegosauruses although most of creatures are large herbivores harmless and feed on vegetables . Humans try desperately escape of dinosaurs and they are chased through leafy jungle by fanged giant animals , specially by the Tyrannosaurus and , of course , by attack of the Velociraptors similar to the first part , Jurassic Park . In fact , the prehistoric animals are truly the stars film , they are terrifyingly awful and create abundant and quite potent screams and scares . There's a stirring and exciting scene dealing a van dangling over a cliff and Tyrannosaurius pushing while the starring are seized in a cord where the actors give vigorous physical performances . The biggest interpretation is by Pete Postlethwaite as a tough and two-fisted slayer and Arliss Howard as greedy man with mean purports . Magnificent especial effects totally convincing are for combination of models in charge of Stan Winston Studio and computer animation by Industrial , Light and Magic of George Lucas . As always spectacular music by John Williams and excellent cinematography by Janusz Kaminski , both of them are Spielberg's habitual . The motion picture was stunningly directed , plus with the typical Steven Spielberg's touches . In the final movie is seen a flying pterosaurusus or Spinosaurius that announces the following movie , the third part .",The Lost World - Jurassic Park
12,BA_Harrison,Makes JP3 look like Oscar winning stuff.,5,28 March 2010,"After the massive success of Jurassic Park, it was pretty clear that a sequel wouldn't be 65 million years in the making; but just because it had less time to evolve doesn't excuse the fact that The Lost World is an inexcusably sloppy piece of movie-making.Jeff Goldblum returns as eccentric mathematician Ian Malcolm, who travels to dinosaur infested island 'site B' to rescue his researcher girlfriend Sarah Harding (no, not the one from Girls Aloud, but rather the lovely Julianne Moore) who has gone to study the scientifically engineered prehistoric creatures not quite appreciating the dangers she will face.What follows is often spectacular, and sometimes downright brilliant (best bit: Moore falling on to the slowly cracking windshield of a truck suspended hundreds of feet above jagged rocks), but any flashes of genius from director Steven Spielberg are easily negated by some of the dumbest plot developments and unintentionally funny bits it has been my displeasure to witness in a big-budget blockbuster.For starters, there is Malcolm's (African-American?!?!) daughter Kelly (Vanessa Lee Chester), who stows on board her father's high tech truck in order to lend the film some kiddy appeal. She provides the film with its most ridiculous moment when she puts her gymnastic skills (conveniently mentioned early on in the film to set up this particular scene) into practise by swinging on some makeshift uneven bars and dismounting with enough force to kick a velociraptor to its death.And she's almost as dreadful in the part where good old T-Rex sticks its huge head into her tent, and she wakes up to ask 'What is that?'. Take a wild guess, sweetie!Then there's the gob-smackingly silly scene where one character is so scared of the snake that slithers into his shirt that he'd rather leave the safety of a cave and be eaten by the dinosaur that has been waiting outside. And let's not forget the fact that a captured T-Rex manages to escape from its cage on a boat, eat everyone on board, and then get trapped back in the hold. Or the daft ending, which has Malcolm and Harding lure the king of the tyrant lizards, fresh from a Godzilla style rampage, back into captivity by using its baby as bait.With all this unintentional hilarity, The Lost World can only be seen as a major disappointment, but I suppose we should at least be grateful that there wasn't a nuclear-blast proof fridge in the film, 'cos that would be really stupid!",The Lost World - Jurassic Park
13,dbdumonteil,it's the same thing as the first movie: worth seeing for its special effects,4,25 April 2003,"The idea of a sequel to the most successful movie made in 1993 stayed rooted in people's minds. Moreover, in the first movie, Sam Neil was astonished by found out that ""dinosaurs are breeding!"". However, scientifics who used to work for the ""jurassic park"" had developed a process that had to make the dinosaurs sterile. Apparently, there must have been a mistake or something they didn't think about. But for Spielberg, this carelessness was a kind of excuse to make a follow-up.As far as this sequel is concerned, well it's far from being superior to the first movie. If special effects are always dramatic and successful (you can notice that Spielberg made the effort to diversify the species of dinosaurs), the screenplay is always few inspired. It appears frankly poor in the way it plays the role of fill-in. Must you add that it contains dialogs that sound hollow and labored? And of, course, unlikelinesses are always on meeting. Nevertheless, one positive side: children nearly never appear during the movie.Steven Spielberg chose Jeff Goldblum in the main role (perhaps, he wanted to grant him more liberty and calibre than in the first movie) but he could have chosen as well Sam Neil.On another hand, when the tyrannosaurus invades San Diego (it gives a little ounce of surrealism to the movie), the movie falls into the ridicule. Instead of feeling anxiety or fear, you laugh a lot when you watch the disasters that the tyrannosaurus causes.At last, the end probably ranks among the worst ends of movie ever made. Indeed, it's too easy and conventional to say that we must let dinosaurs live on their island and it gives birth to a childish moral. Besides, the movie globally gives off a feeling of great childishness due to the characters' every moves and thoughts. Especially the clan of wicked people who mean to capture dinosaurs in order to create another ""Jurassic park"" in San Diego. A flat and poor sequel. I didn't watch ""Jurassic Park 3"" and I don't know what it's worth. When will ""jurassic park 4"" be ?",The Lost World - Jurassic Park
14,Quinoa1984,Contrived but sometimes fun,6,13 November 2000,"To say this film is almost the clone of Jurassic Park (no pun intended) is to give Spielberg credit.  This film is a large drop off from the original and while sequels don't get up to the original, this one does try, but flails.  Story has ex mathematician/celebrity Ian Malcolm (played with some clueless finesse by Jeff Goldblum) going to another island by Attenborough with dinosaurs running loose with chaos and other plot things ensuing. Sometimes entertaining compared some other c**p, but to view along side the original is a no-brainer.  One other thing, why put the first smashing scene from the first book into the second movie?  Best scene for me though isn't T-Rex in San Diego (despite that being fun), but rather Vince Vaughn being chased by little reptile dinosaur things.  B-",The Lost World - Jurassic Park
15,BandSAboutMovies,Rough going,4,22 June 2018,"There's another island. Isla Sorna is where the dinosaurs were raised and also where a rich little girl wanders into a compsognathus attack. From this opening, you know that you're in for a much darker ride. It's one of those movies where kindly Spielberg decides that he should have made Night Skies instead of E.T. and indulges all the meanness he has festering inside upon his characters.John Hammond's nephew, Peter Ludlow is trying to use the island to fix the losses that Jurassic Park incurred. The old man has taken a dramatic change of heart, realizing that he should have never tried to open a theme park all those years ago and that these dinosaurs need to be protected. If you're kind of taken aback by all of the character flip-flops here, buckle up. You know - because guys in their seventies suddenly stop being capitalists and suddenly start caring for the common man, like Peter on the road to Damascus. It can happen.Ian Malcolm is the only one that comes back, save for cameos from his grandchildren. Turns out that Julianne Moore is in this, playing Ian's girlfriend Dr. Sarah Harding, and that she's already on the island. For the last four years, Ian has been discredited and disbarred for speaking out on Jurassic Park. The last thing he wants to do is go back, but to save the girl he loves, he has to.Ian joins the team of equipment guy Eddie Carr and documentarian Nick Van Owen (Vince Vaughn), as well as his daughter Kelly who has stowed away. Just as they catch up with Dr. Sarah, a whole new InGen squad shows up, made up of mercs and hunters. Chief amongst them are Pete Postlethwaite as Roland Tembo, a big game hunter who dreams of bagging a T. Rex, Fargo's Peter Stormare as Dieter Stark and Dr. Robert Burke, a dinosaur expert played by Thomas F. Duffy (the demeted Charles Wilson from Death Wish 2!).Tembo's plan is to tie up a baby T. Rex and use it to lure in the mother or father. And InGen wants to get as many dinosaurs as possible so they can open a new Jurassic Park in San Diego. None of these ideas are good and they blow up in everyone's face.There's a great moment in here where all of Malcolm's team's vehicles plunge off a cliff and some nifty action pieces, but it all feels rather disjointed. By the time everyone teams up and gets off the island, I was kind of hoping the film was over, only to learn there was so much more movie left. It's a very late 90's style of blockbuster - give it more running time and more story versus more thinking.At the end, the dinosaurs are placed in an animal preserve free from human interference. Hammond steals Malcolm's line, saying that ""Life will find a way.""Spielberg eventually said that he didn't enjoy making this film. It kind of shows.

17,sunwarrior13,Far From Compelling Compared To Jurassic Park,8,6 November 2016,"After the success of the film Jurassic Park,the late Michael Crichton was asked to write a sequel novel by both fans and director Steven Spielberg.This resulted in the book entitled The Lost World and a film adaptation by Spielberg entitled The Lost World: Jurassic Park,which was loosely based on the said novel.It stars Jeff Goldblum,Julianne Moore,Pete Postlethwaite,Arliss Howard,Vince Vaughn and Vanessa Lee Chester.The story of the film was set four years later after the events of Jurassic Park at a fictional deserted island called Isla Sorna that hovers around Central America particularly Costa Rica.In it are cloned dinosaurs that were produced by InGen.The company's owner John Hammond's nephew took control of the said ecosystem and he is planning to take the dinosaurs to the mainland. Learning about it,Hammond sends Dr. Ian Malcolm and his group to not allow it to happen before his nephew arrives.The story focuses on how both groups - Malcolm's group and Hammond's nephew's group - try to confront each other to pursue their objectives but ultimately team up to survive against the cloned dinosaurs amidst the extreme danger facing them.With regards to the visuals and special effects,this definitely is better as compared to the first film due to the use of Computer- generated Imagery or CGI.Too bad that it focused more on the action scenes and violence that the cloned dinosaurs caused rather than the characters involved.It also hurt that only Jeff Goldblum is the only one returning from the previous cast.Added to that,it suffered from being a sequel wherein viewers were expecting at least the same compelling entertainment it got from the first film.Too bad that The Lost Park did not deliver in that area.But it was good enough to please many viewers if expectations aren't higher compared to the first film.",The Lost World - Jurassic Park
18,hitchcockthelegend,Actually where you're going is the only place in the world where the geese chase you!,7,9 March 2013,"The Lost World: Jurassic Park is directed by Steven Spielberg and adapted to screenplay by David Koepp from the novel written by Michael Crichton. It stars Jeff Goldblum, Julianne Moore, Pete Postlethwaite, Vince Vaughn, Richard Schiff, Peter Stormare, Vanessa Lee Chester, Arliss Howard and Harvey Jason. Music is scored by John Williams and cinematography by Janusz Kamiński.Four years on from the horrors of Jurassic Park on Isla Nublar, it transpires that there is a second dinosaur site on Isla Sornar. Dr. Ian Malcolm (Goldblum) is forced to head off to face the horrors once again when he learns that his paleontologist girlfriend, Sara Harding (Moore), is already on the island as a forerunner to a team John Hammond (Richard Attenborough) is assembling to document the dinosaurs in their habitat. Once their, though, the problems soon arise, especially when a team from InGen arrive with other ideas about the dinosaurs on their minds.Given the massive success of Jurassic Park in 1993, a sequel was inevitable. What transpires is pretty much more of the same, it's very safe film making by Spielberg. Coming off of the emotional exertions of his last film, Schindler's List, few can deny that the director was entitled to wind down with The Lost World project, there was after all nothing safe about Schindler's, but although Jurassic 2 is a hugely enjoyable family blockbuster, a jazzy bit of hi-tech fun, it lacks the requisite brains to make it an inspiring sequel.Formula follows the same path, humans in peril on the island, with some added and new dinosaurs (double T-Rex a bonus), and then the ""twist"" in the narrative sees some monster peril come to San Diego, King Kong style, for the finale. There's inter fighting between the good dudes led by Malcolm and the bad guys led by the weasel Peter Ludlow (Howard) who is Hammond's conniving nephew and current head of InGen. Family issues also feature, of course since this is Spielberg after all, while the dangers of tampering with science message remains as strong as ever.Cast are ably led by a witty Goldblum, who is a reassuring presence carried over from the first film, and the tech-credits are as expected, very high. Some scenes soar, such as a sequence shot from under a pane of glass that starts to crack under the weight of a character, others not so, such as having Malcolm's teenage daughter turn into Nadia Comăneci for one credulity stretching scene. But all told it's an honest blockbuster purely aimed at the target audience who helped to see it make over $600 million in profit. Safe often pays you see, and as sequels go it's one of the better ones in the 90s. It's exciting if intellectually stunted. 7/10",The Lost World - Jurassic Park
19,Theo Robertson,A Needless Sequel,6,5 June 2004,"THE LOST WORLD has the same strengths and weaknesses as the original movie . The strengths are the same breath taking special effects and the dark , moody atmosphere seen in the original . It also features the character of John Hammond who is supposed to Scottish but has an indescriable accent that is nothing like the one myself and five million Scots possess . Unfortunately since it`s a sequel it brings weaknesses of its own to the story . Did you see the trailers where the dinosuar is brought back to America ? Did this give the impression that this was going to be KING KONG with reptiles ? That`s I thought but it`s difficult to believe that this sub plot happens almost three quarters of the way into the movie . In fact it just seems to have featured almost as an after thought when in fact it should have been the central plot to movie , until we get to that part we have an adventure that basically covers the same ground as JURASSIC PARK , we even get to see an English big game hunter . Come on Michael Crichton you`ll give deja vu a bad name if you`re not careful .
Strangely enough my favourite scene is where one of the characters discusses Greenpeace :"" What drew you to Greenpeace ? "" "" Women "" Hey someone has been doing their homework",The Lost World - Jurassic Park
20,poolandrews,"""Let's get this movable feast underway."" Decent enough sequel.",7,28 December 2006,"The Lost World: Jurassic Park starts as Dr. Ian Malcolm (Jeff Goldblum) visits eccentric billionaire John Hammond (Richard Attenborough) for the first time in four years since the events of the original Jurassic Park (1993) which were covered up, John tells Ian that besides the island in the original there was a 'site B' where the Dinosaurs were born. He is organising an expedition to the island to document the Dinosaurs there & to try to save them from his money grabbing nephew who now controls the company InGen. At first Ian refuses but once he learns his girlfriend Dr. Sarah Harding (Julianne Moore) is involved he's in, along with photographer Nick Van Owen (Vince Vaughn) & filmmaker Eddie Carr (Richard Schiff) they all travel to the island. However they are soon joined by Hammond's nephew, a big game hunter named Roland Tembo (Pete Postlethwaite) & a load of heavily armed men who are there to collect some Dinosaurs in an attempt to resurrect the idea of a Dinosaur zoo this time in San Diego...Directed by Steven Spielberg The Lost World: Jurassic Park is the follow up to Spielberg's phenomenal monster box-office hit Jurassic Park & isn't as good as the original but is still a decent & perfectly entertaining effort. The script by David Koepp & was based on the novel 'The Lost World' by Michael Crichton which I haven't read but the two apparently share little in the way of similarity. The thing that hurts The Lost World: Jurassic Park in my opinion is that the script is so loose, it has little focus & relies on nothing more than another group of scientists & people who want to exploit the Dinosaurs having lots of coincidence's conspire against them which leaves them all trapped on an island with loads of killer Dinosaurs for company. It feels very similar to the original but somehow even less, there's nothing of any substance, there's nothing that drives the story forward & Spielberg gives us yet another highly annoying kid, the scene where she kills the Raptor was easily the worst part of the film for me. I hate annoying kids! The character's are OK but Postlethwaite's hunter character is all tough to start with but by the time the film finishes he's repented! He should have been the main villain, instead they turned him into a bleeding heart liberal who gets dumped from the film totally about 20 minutes before the end never to be seen again. I sill thought it was decent, it moves along at a nice pace & the climax where the T-Rex stomps it's way through San Diego is cool even though it feels like it's been edited in from a completely different film.Director Spielberg does a good job, the special effects are top-drawer as one would expect & there's some great moments. Whenever the T-Rex's are on screen the films pretty cool, the climax in San Diego is a great sequence as is the part where the truck gets pushed over the cliff & everyone is left dangling inside. There's a few effective scare moments & the set-pieces are very good. There's a touch of gore with people being eaten, there's a severed hand, someone is bitten in two & a couple more scenes which may not be suitable for the youngest of viewers.With a supposed budget of about $73,000,000 & it made nearly $93,000,000 on it's opening weekend, technically it's top-notch & is as well made as anything out there with plenty of big budget Hollywood polish. The acting was OK with Goldblum standing out, I won't mention the annoying kid. Oh sorry, I just did.The Lost World: Jurassic Park is a decent sequel, I liked it & think it makes for good entertainment. It's well worth a watch but maybe it's not the film it could have been.",The Lost World - Jurassic Park

22,Boba_Fett1138,"Spielberg uses ""Aliens"" formula but fails.",7,25 October 2003,"Compared to the first ""Jurassic Park"" movie this movie is action packed and much more spectacular (""Aliens"" formula) but does that mean it is better?It is always hard to come up with a story for a sequel. And in this case the movie also lacks lot's of things and has quite a few plot holes and ridiculous moments like with many sequels is always the case. Still I enjoy this movie. If you can look through all this bad elements you will get a entertaining threat with some spectacular moments.But yes, at some points it beats ""Jurassic Park"". for instance the characters are better and the dinosaurs are used in a more thrilling and interesting way, I love how the dinosaurs are giving a character, especially the T-Rex's. Also visually the movie looks better thanks to Janusz Kaminski's cinematography, actually it's eye candy!The cast is also a huge plus. Giving Jeff Goldblum the main part this time was a great move. Pete Postlethwaite, Julianne Moore, Arliss Howard (great villain!) and Peter Stormare are great additions to the cast.One thing I strongly disliked about this movie is that it tries to be political correct at many points which results in ridiculous moments.The action movie lover however will not be disappointed. There are lot's of spectacular moments such as the glass breaking scene that truly is nerve wrecking. The Raptors once again provide the most spectacular moments, I especially like the tall grass sequence. And the few seconds boat crash is more spectacular then the entire boat crash from ""Speed 2: Cruise Control""!***SPOILER*** The movie however makes at the ending an huge mistake to set the T-Rex loose in San Diego with as a result a Japanese monster movie ending. Sure, I like the whole T-Rex in San Diego sequence but it just doesn't fit the movie. It doesn't flow. You can even say that it makes the movie ridiculous especially when Spielberg tries to spoof way to many movies no matter how funny it is.***END OF SPOILER***Yet I enjoy watching this movie and I far from hate it but it's also far from perfect.7/10http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/",The Lost World - Jurassic Park
23,view_and_review,Two Rexes for Part Two,7,16 October 2020,"It's the sequel, so how can we manufacture a way for people to be eaten by T-Rexes and Velociraptors again? Well, there happened to be a back up island full of dinosaurs, we'll call it the break-in island where they could work out the kinks for the main park. This was called Isla Sorna.Isla Sorna, like Isla Nublar, was in total disrepair due to storms. The dinosaurs were roaming about the entire island and had created their own ecosystem and even solved the problem of their ""lysine deficiency."" Old man Hammond (Richard Attenborough) wants to send a team of people into Isla Sorna to study the dinosaurs which included Ian Malcolm (Jeff Goldblum). Ian is understandably avidly opposed to the idea, but his girlfriend and paleontologist, Sarah Harding (Julianne Moore), is already there, so now Ian wants to save her. Also, on the team was Nick Van Owen (Vince Vaughn) the eco-warrior, Eddie Carr (Richard Schiff) the tech guy, and Ian's daughter, Kelly (Vanessa Chester), who was either adopted or the mailman's daughter because their wasn't a trace of Ian's DNA visible on her.Something has to put them in danger though. After all, we're watching this for the toothy large predators, not for big lumbering herbivores. To further the plot and provide excitement there was an aggressive team of hunters there to capture some dinosaurs and bring them back to San Diego where a more affordable theme park has been built. These hunters manage to rile up two T-Rexes and the smaller sleeker velociraptors.""The Lost World"" lacked the essential qualities of ""Jurassic Park:"" the originality and suspense that came with the originality. Now we know what the T-Rex looks like on screen and what it can do. We also know what the raptors look like on screen and what they can do. How can they up their game? They couldn't. Even the T-Rex roar wasn't as terrifying as it was in ""Jurassic Park.""

In particular, the CGI dinosaurs - used fairly sparingly in the original movie - are everywhere and, almost without exception, are perfectly realised. The raptor hunt in the derelict command centre, and the T Rex in Santa Monica, are both flawlessly executed sequences.There are some areas I have to pick fault with: 1. I can have enough of Jeff Goldblum's mannered delivery quite quickly, and I had enough of it in the first one; 2. I also don't care for Julianne Moore very much;3. The caravans over the cliff sequence, obviously a major set piece, went on too long and strained credulity a bit too much for me.Otherwise, this is a terrific movie.",The Lost World - Jurassic Park

The T-Rex has them cornered behind a waterfall and somebody panics over a snake and throws himself into its jaws. Predictable idiotic geek show with great special effects. Steven Spielberg is at his worst here. In fact, he makes his bomb 1941 look like art in comparison. Goldblum returns and Julianne Moore plays his moron girlfriend who has more guts than brains.

He reluctantly agrees, and after locating her, finds to their disgust that the company INGEN has allowed hunting parties to take place, where big-game hunters(led by Pete Postlethwaite) stalk and kill dinosaurs, though the tables would of course be turned...Good sequel has equally effective F/X and terrifying story, though a few too many characters; the twist toward the end is surprising and entertaining, though some poor editing leaves a big plot hole aboard the discovered freighter...still, a worthy sequel that holds up today.",The Lost World - Jurassic Park

This new group however are not there for biological data but instead have something more sinister in mind.After a series of events, both groups become stranded when all their communication equipment is lost.It is then that the terror really begins as both groups scramble for their lives....If ever there was going to be a sequel to a movie, this had to be the one, but the title should have been 'The cool one from Jurassic Park, has his own movie!!'.And while it's nowhere near as good as the first movie, and even though it has some silly moments, and is a tad overlong, it's still a gripping movie.The Spielberg magic is still there, it's evident when Moore is laying on the pane of glass and it's cracking, and the grass paths being formed by the Velociraptors in their opening scene.But obviously the film has many flaws, Vince Vaughn, he's annoying, and then just vanishes before the final act. Goldblum is the star, but it looks like his job here is to say something funny every now and again, moan, and do that thing he did in the original and Independence Day where something happens and he spouts a line (think 'Checkmate').Postlethwaite is the best thing here, but his subplot is way overlong and completely out of context with the rest of the film.The final act is good, but doesn't carry the oomph factor we were all expecting.So all in all it's a fine movie, not the best sequel in the world, but not as bad as the critics make it out to be.",The Lost World - Jurassic Park
30,Aaron1375,This movie just sucked...*warning contains spoilers!!!,2,3 April 2001,"This movie was really bad.  Seeing the previews I was expecting so much, but got so little.  It is hard to find a point to start with my complaints but here goes.  First, were the previews themselves, they led me to believe the army was going to raid the island.  That would have been great some dinosaurs getting blasted, some army men getting killed. Instead the army was not involved very much and it was just the same ol look at the dinosaurs aren't they neat!  Jeff Goldblum's character is the only member remaining from the first one that remembers dinosaurs were on the island.  Who knew the old man made them sign a I will keep my mouth shut contract because know one will believe me anyway.  And what is the point of his daughter the super gymnst who can kick a raptor down, but couldn't make the team?  That is just one example of the flaws in this movie.  Another major problem was when the T-Rex was shipped to the US.  It arrives locked in the bunker and the crew is all gone except an arm here and there.  What the heck happened to the darn crew?  The T-rex was locked below, did he just decide to go back down, did the crew eat each other, or maybe they simply exploded (because let's face it there was no damage to the ship and a T-rex running amok on deck will cause some).  And who thought of the last part of the movie.  Apparently you were supposed to root for Goldblum and Moore locking the T-rex in the cargo hold and not the person about to blast the thing and end its artificial life.  This after the t-rex killed many innocent people and a doggy.  I am sorry I was close to yelling waste him in the theater.  To sum up this movie sucks, big time!  I saw this movie once and I never want to see it again. My final gripe is another stupid problem with this film.  Does every single person killed have to flop behind a tree or car before there eaten.  I understand that they wanted to keep this PG-13, but really everyone looked like rodeo clowns.",The Lost World - Jurassic Park
31,The_Void,Well worked and entertaining blockbuster sequel...couldn't have asked for much more,7,30 July 2006,"This sequel to the 1993 blockbuster tends to get a bad write-up from all corners, but I don't really know why. People complain about it trying to market the brand too much and featuring too many illogical and inconsistent events; but the thing you've got to remember is that this is a sequel to a fantasy blockbuster...so how can you go in expecting anything else. Personally, I've always found this film to be a far more worthwhile dinosaur themed adventure film than the first film; I held that opinion when I first saw it (in my early teens), and upon rewatching it - I'm retaining the same opinion. It has to be said that the sense of wonder is somewhat depleted, but Spielberg seems all the more keen to capitalise on the danger of the situation this time around, and that more than makes up for the fact that we've seen his array of monsters before. The plot simply follows an another excursion into dinosaur territory, only this time the monsters are on an island named 'Isla Sorna' somewhere near Costa Rica, and the lead is Ian Malcolm; by far the most interesting character in the original film.The fact that the lead role has been taken away from Sam Neill is an overall plus point for the film, as Jeff Goldblum makes for a far edgy lead, which suits the theme of this sequel. Goldblum receives good support from an array of talented stars, including Julianne Moore, Vince Vaughn, Peter Stormare, Richard Schiff and; best of all, Pete Postlethwaite, who brings a touch of class to the film in the role of a hunter. Given that it's a sequel, writer David Koepp doesn't need to spend as much time building up the central plot and therefore we get straight into it...which can only be a good thing. The action scenes are really well done, and a variety of different species of dinosaur help to ensure that the film always has enough up its sleeve to remain entertaining. Scenes involving the Tyrannosaurus Rex early on, as well as an awesome sequence involving Velociraptors and long grass are the pick of the action right up until the end; when Spielberg lets rip with the highlight of the entire series, which sees the main dinosaur rampaging down a busy San Francisco high street! Overall, this is not brilliant or a masterpiece; but it's a very good film for what it is and I wouldn't hesitate to rate it as the best of the series.",The Lost World - Jurassic Park
32,zetes,I laughed more than anything else. SPOILERS,6,28 July 2001,"Most people thought this was the biggest cinematic disappointment that they had ever seen, that is, until Star Wars: Episode 1 - The Phantom Menace was released two summers afterwards. I write this right after having come home from the third installment, Jurassic Park III, and I can safely say that JPII is the worst of the first 3 (apparently they're going to make one more, at least). Still, I didn't despise it as much as the majority of people.
The Lost World: Jurassic Park is the king of unintentional comedy. I've seen honest-to-God Godzilla movies that were less corny than this film. I had sat through the first half-hour, 45 minutes getting more and more irritated, but then came the scene where the trailer was dangling from a cliff. The characters are all hanging onto a rope on the inside of it, and, when it falls, everyone miraculously is able to hang onto the rope and keep it steady so that, say, a door didn't knock them off. My friend sitting next to me shouted ""Bull Sh*t!"" I laughed. After that, it all became a laugh-fest. Whether it was Peter Stormare being devoured by tiny dinos or a little black girl (from the where-the-heck-did-you-come-from files) spinning around a randomly placed bar and kicking a raptor in the head (Jeff Goldblum's immortal unintentionally funny line: ""So you failed the gymnastics test, huh?""), I was almost on the floor at times. The best scenes result when, King Kong-style, the characters idiotically haul the T-Rex back to San Francisco, where she can munch on dogs and Japanese people (I've heard a rumor that the Japanese fellow it devours says: ""Why does this always happen to me?"" in Japanese, although that sounds like a tall tale to me).
Yes, this is a terrible movie, but it is one that contains as many laughs as 90% of the comedy being released nowadays. 6/10. Heck, if it weren't for the fun-killing acting of Jeff Goldblum and Julianne Moore (easily the lowest point in her otherwise shining career), I would recommend this movie.",The Lost World - Jurassic Park

Throw in another rabble of weak characters with the hunting party and there's not a lot of excitement here. It's all monster movie, no sense of wonder, and some genuine silliness thrown in. Gymnastics on a raptor? That didn't seem wrong even on paper? Then there's the San Diego post script to get through (terrified Japanese fleeing a T. Rex?

35,StevePulaski,A moodier take on an instant classic,8,10 June 2015,"Despite having perhaps one of the worst sequel titles in film history, The Lost World: Jurassic Park winds up being a favorable dinosaur outing. One of the pleasant things about the Jurassic Park franchise is that dinosaur films are few and far between, which allows for the ideas and sequences in these films to remain mostly fresh. There's little interference with ""been there, done that"" responses to action setpieces, nor is there a general cynicism to the tones of these films or the imagery (which gets especially moodier in this film). The wonder and elements of peril are still firmly instilled in Spielberg's direction and David Koepp's screenplay, making for a film that continues to really emphasize the thrill of its predecessor through nearly every scene.We focus on Ian Malcolm (Jeff Goldblum), who is hired by InGen CEO John Hammond (Richard Attenborough) to document the activities of the dinosaurs on Hammond's second Jurassic Park site after the terrible breakdown of his first site before financiers close the second park. Initially apprehensive, Malcolm turns compliant when he sees his paleontologist girlfriend Sarah (Julianne Moore) packed up and ready to go, in addition to his daughter Kelly (Vanessa Lee Chester) from his first marriage. On the trip, Malcolm winds up meeting an ecological film crew run by Vince Vaughn's Nick as well as a famous hunter known as Roland Tembo (Pete Postlethwaite). As expected, however, the same catastrophe that occurred in the first park repeats itself with the second, making for a frightening and dangerous experience for the long-suffering individuals who recall Jurassic Park's initial failure all too well.The sole thing The Lost World does better than its predecessor is give us a group of more interesting characters and character actors. Seeing Goldblum, Moore, and Vaughn work off one another in a way that channels misfit tendencies very nicely is something to relish, for seeing all these actors in such a goofy, fun-loving project makes the price of admission already worth it. This band of characters, while still not entirely fleshed out, is still a lot better than the marginally amusing cast of characters from the first movie, which benefited largely from the effortless charisma of the everyman Wayne Knight.Still instilled in The Lost World from the original Jurassic Park film is the film's desire to keep us feeling constant danger and uncertainty. Jurassic Park's main attraction, besides state-of-the-art special effects, was the fact that it always made us feel at the mercy of enormous, hulking dinosaurs, regardless of where we tried to hide (or where the camera place us). Spielberg clearly capitalizes on this principle with this particular film, giving us the feeling of minimal safety he did with not only this film's predecessor, but his other projects like Duel and Poltergeist.Then there's the element of darkness in this film that's significantly more present here than it was in the first film. Rather than encapsulating the common attributes of flashy, summer blockbusters, The Lost World finds itself assuming a moodier state of mind, actively showing innocent bystanders consumed by dinosaurs, young people mauled by baby dinosaurs, and more. There's a flood of action and suspenseful sequences that really amount to some fully realized events in this film. Consider the scene when Kelly performs a complex gymnastics routine to save Malcolm and Sarah, or when the dinosaurs are attacking the film crew and Malcolm works to rescue them.In some ways, The Lost World finds ways to be more engaging than Jurassic Park. Its moodier style further exploits the dangers of dinosaurs, and the repeated peril that humans face when trying to assimilate to their world. The Lost World: Jurassic Park continues to affirm this frightening realization while remaining a thrilling piece of blockbuster entertainment, never squandering the opportunity to be dark and violent but also peppering in the occasional one-liner (some funny, some cringe-worthy) for good measure. Much like its predecessor, this is ultimately a variation on the summer blockbuster done well and in a consistently enjoyable manner.Starring: Jeff Goldblum, Julianne Moore, Vanessa Lee Chester, Vince Vaughn, Pete Postlethwaite, and Richard Attenborough.

37,MovieAddict2016,Read the book...,6,22 August 2002,"The first Jurassic Park was very good, as was the book, and while THE LOST WORLD novel isn't as good as the first, the film's even farther off. Jeff Goldblum's character has done a complete 180 degree turn into some ""Know it all preacher."" I hate the scene where he says something like "" Ooh, yeah, that's how it all starts-then there's screaming and yelling and running."" He sounds incredibly stupid when he's saying it, and his character in this film is just plain annoying. I love the first and third film, and despite the sickening rumors of Ian Malcolm coming back for film 4, I hop that Grant (Sam Neill) comes back for more. I'm hoping unless the script is excellent, they don't make another stupid film to end the series like The Lost World. Let's hop for something like film 1 or 3( hearing rumors of film 5 too. I guess people love the dinos-I know I do).  I give the Lost World 2/5 stars for having some good dinosaur sequences-other than that it's a pass. JOHN ULMER",The Lost World - Jurassic Park
38,DKosty123,Difficult To Sequel A Classic,5,29 April 2007,"This movie proves how difficult it is to sequel a classic. The plot is really simple to understand. The is yet another island with more dinosaurs which has gone totally into out of control chaos. The movies final message of ""Let's Leave Them Alone,"" is interesting as the way modern man always thinks they control everything, an admission that this situation is beyond man's control is rare in cinema now days.Trouble with this film is that while it completes the themes from the original King Kong that were not touched on in the original film, it gets too long & the story is lackluster. Spielburg also becomes predictable as even the action sequences look alike when compared with the first time around.The only thing original is the shots of a dinosaur going past a swimming pool which is a neat visual effect. That's not enough, as this one sold a lot of tickets because of the first film, not because of it's own merits.",The Lost World - Jurassic Park
39,KineticSeoul,A solid sequel to a classic,8,8 June 2015,"This is a solid follow up to a classic dinosaur crisis movie. I remember watching this movie at the theater as a kid and enjoying the heck out of it. As a kid I just really found this film to be mesmerizing, exciting and entertaining. Watching it now I still found it to be a enthralling and fun movie to watch. The plot is coherent and the sense of action and excitement with the story is put together very well. There is a lot of good ideas and settings when it comes to the dinosaurs and human interactions and action sequences. It all melds together in the good old fashion Spielberg style. To the point it was thrilling from beginning to end. Most of the characters was coherent with the story and it was nice to see Dr. Ian Malcolm (Jeff Goldblum) as the main lead this time around, since he was a likable character in the first ""Jurassic Park"" movie. Although the actress that played Ian's daughter was pretty bad when it comes to the acting department, at least in this film. Overall this movie is most definitely a worthwhile watch and it's one of those films I don't get why some reviewers bash on it.8.4/10",The Lost World - Jurassic Park
40,OllieSuave-007,A Heartpounding Sequel!,8,4 May 2001,"Like its prequel, I first watched this movie in the theaters and it was edge-of-the-seat excitement. Here, we have Dr. Hammond, the billionaire who founded Jurassic Park, trying to make up for his past mistakes by sending Dr. Malcolm the mathematician to a second ""Jurassic Park"" island, where Dr. Hammond's nephew is trying to kidnap the dinosaurs and exploit them in his San Diego theme park. Dr. Hammond's goal is to let the dinosaurs roam free on the island, away from mankind. There are more dinosaurs in this film, including my favorite one, Stegosaurus. Like the previous film, the sound and special effects for the dinosaurs made the creatures well-executed and realistic, making the movie believable. The cast of characters is larger in number in this movie, with each playing a significant role to help accentuate the plot of the movie and keep it going at a fast pace. Steven Spielberg gave another solid direction for this film, providing non-stop scenes of thrills, drama and character development. My favorite part in the movie is when Sarah (Julianne Moore) attempts to escape from being trapped inside her collapsed trailer hanging over a cliff, trying not to fall through the glass while it slowly breaks open. Also, my favorite line in the movie is when Ian (Jeff Goldblum) tells Sarah she would return home in not a couple of weeks but a couple of pieces. I thought, though, that the excessive dinosaur attacks are a little overkill and the movie lacks the charm and spirit of the first one. It's still a thrilling and chilling film, but doesn't quite surpass its prequel.Grade B",The Lost World - Jurassic Park
41,thesar-2,Lost in the Park(ing lot),5,23 January 2011,"Originally, when I watched Jurassic Park upon opening weekend, I wasn't too fond of it. Despite its shortcomings: an unoriginal script that relied heavy on what they could do with special effects – damn, those dinos still look real! – it has grown on me over the years, especially due to those realistic dinos and the excellent character of Ian Malcolm (Goldblum.)Unfortunately, as the tagline goes, something has survived, but it wasn't Ian who's been reduced to ""Action Figure"" in the follow-up: The Lost World: Jurassic Park.And as uneven as the movie is, boy it wants to be several different flicks, the movie is a very nice, updated and darker tale than the original. That's not saying it's better, but it's a good sequel, nonetheless.One of the flicks it wanted to be, and heavily advertised, was a truer version of the 60-year-old Godzilla tale of a dinosaur running amok in the city. This: I could not wait to see and alas, was thoroughly disappointed that it was only the final act with roughly 15 minutes (of 129) of city terror. Too bad. In addition, one of my complaints of the first, were the wooden and boring children Spielberg so loves to shine on (E.T.) Here, I'm only guessing he was trying to make a statement of acceptance with the new ""kid star"" of the feature: Vanessa Lee Chester, who plays Ian's daughter, Kelly. She's black, he's white, I get it – this is more of a shove-down-the-throat statement more relevant in the Lethal Weapon franchise – but I could care less about that. What I cared most about, was not only how dull she was, but she actually made the kids in the first one more lovable. I really need to tone down my criticisms as it could always be worse (SEE: Jurassic Park III.)The series did take a good turn with the direction the series took with an ""Aliens"" approach and a great new character of the hunter, Roland Tembo (Postlethwaite.) Yeah, I know, it's again (mostly) on the island, and yeah, I know, it's another rescue mission, but it's fun to watch. Even with the other (again, Lethal Weapon) subliminal message of animal cruelty – thanks mostly to Vince Vaughn in his break-through role of PETA-type photographer, Nick.I'm not an activist, but I definitely don't condone the cruelty to animals. That said, whenever a movie ""sides"" with the PETA soldiers, I laugh my ass off when they get bit, themselves, from the very beings they're trying to save. SEE: 28 Days Later.What we have here isThe return of John Hammond (Attenborough) who, by the way died at the end of Jurassic Park (the book) soI guess somethings have survived, indeed. Anyways, in a flimsy way of getting Dr. Ian Malcolm back onto an island full of giant (and small) monsters, Hammond uses Ian's girlfriend, Dr. Sarah Harding (Moore) as bait. She's been on the island for some time, studying the animals. Ian accepts, making this more of a rescue mission (hence, the action star who checks his chaos at the door.)Undeniably, it quickly turns into ""how do we get off the island in one piece"" again, when daughter Kelly stows away and Nick's constantly trying to sabotage the other human inhabitants of the island from bringing the dinos to the mainland – San Diego. Nick's feisty efforts of saving the genetically, shouldn't-be-here-anyways, engineered dinosaurs does lead to chaos (full circle) and to people's deaths. Oh, well, at least he saved a few animal lives.The two groups merge with the common goal of escape since Nick's animal-lovin' ways caused enough disturbance, they're all vulnerable and at the same time, lunch for the dinos.Obviously, they're gonna get off the island, just so they can get to what the advertisements promised: a T-Rex in San Diego.It's a satisfying conclusion to part one and contains a lot of action and great cinematography. Also, they step up what they've already accomplished in part one: two T-rexes fighting for their young, this time in my favorite scene in the movie – when the trailer goes over the edge.It's worth a watch and like I said, it's a good conclusion: stop watching the Jurassic Park series here. Trust meyou don't want to waste your precious life on the irrelevant, franchise-killer: Jurassic Park III.",The Lost World - Jurassic Park
42,FeastMode,my notes,6,25 June 2019,"Lots of awesome parts and creative ways to use the dinosaurs. great directing. but not nearly as good as the first, and some really stupid stuff. and the musical score is significantly worse. it's not bad, it just doesn't enhance the movie, whereas the first musical score is one the best ever and gives you goosebumps and makes you feel awe (about 5 viewings)

43,Robert_duder,Potentially better than the original? A new perspective.,8,4 September 2008,"Years ago when I saw the first Jurassic Park in the theater as a kid, I was blown away, glued to my seat. I mean every kid is in love with Dinosaurs and Spielberg's brilliant Dino epic brought them to life unlike anything before or since. When I watched it again to review it just a few short weeks ago I was disappointed that somehow some of the magic had been lost. Whether it be seeing it too many times, or seeing in on a smaller screen, or just not having that wide eyed dino fascination anymore...something lacked although still a powerfully made and fun movie!! So then I watch The Lost World, which I had seen before as well but I seem to remember thinking all those years ago that it paled in comparison to the original but upon seeing it again I was taken aback that I might have actually enjoyed it more than the original and I think I understand why. In the first film Spielberg aimed to bring to life every child's imagination and create dinosaurs like we've never seen but I don't think he even expected the enormous response to the film. Everyone loved it, it brought the child out in all of us and adults, as opposed to kids made Jurassic Park a top grossing film world wide. So Spielberg knew that if he were to do a sequel he would try to appeal more to that surprise crowd hence we have a darker, more mysterious, slightly more violent Jurassic Park 2: The Lost World.Jeff Goldblum returns again as everyones favorite Mathematician Dr. Ian Malcolm who has been summoned to the side of Jurassic Park creator John Hammond. Goldblum gets all of his sarcasm and wit from the original film but gets even more personality being the star now. He is a little more serious this time around but he leads the film with class and expertise and makes a great hero. Joining the cast is Julianne Moore who I have never been a big fan of but as it turns out she does a really terrific job as Paleontologist Sarah Harding and Goldblum's girlfriend. She fills the role left by Ellie Sattler (Laura Dern) very well. She is fun and strong and a great female lead and as odd as they seem together her and Goldblum have good chemistry. Richard Schiff as one of their team members is great if not short lived. He has good chemistry with the rest of the team and has a great character. Vince Vaughn even comes on board and doesn't take anything away from the story with his usual antics and instead plays a really great role as anxious photographer with morals Nick Van Owen. He turns in one of my favorite Jurassic Park characters. Great character actor Pete Postlethwaite is perfect as the angry, determined world hunter and although he doesn't get a big role it's great!! I was also very happy that they wrap up the story a little and had cameo appearances by original cast members Richard Attenborough, Joseph Mazzello, and Ariana Richards however brief they were.I read a lot of reviews for this film and it actually kind of surprised me how many people did not like this entry in the series at all. They especially seemed to hate the ending with the T-Rex in America and I think I might have not been a big fan originally either and yet watching it again it seemed to be amazing to me. It was the perfect idea...Hammond's disastrous creation coming home to roost so to speak. The action in the original Jurassic Park was non-stop thrill ride and this installment was no exception from the absolutely nail biting trailer scene with the baby T-Rex up to the chase through the city with the dinosaur. I think perhaps it boils down to having not seen this sequel as many times as the original but still I was very impressed and I loved it!! I have read the books years ago and I remember little to nothing about them so that doesn't effect my review either. I just felt that Spielberg made the story a little darker, more mature, and more gritty and violent without spilling into gratuitous by any means. Regardless the special effects are still spot on and it's a great follow up to a classic movie that must be seen so you can judge yourself. 8.5/10",The Lost World - Jurassic Park
44,Pjtaylor-96-138044,"Perhaps if it didn't follow such a masterpiece, it wouldn't have been such a let-down.",6,10 June 2018,"There are moments, as brief as they may be, of genuine entertainment in 'The Lost World: Jurassic Park (1997)'. Flashes of the creative brilliance behind the lens occasionally seep onto the screen, and it is in these sequences that the picture finds its footing as an incredibly inconsistent, at times confusingly so, follow-up to one of cinema's greatest achievements. It does manage to make its own mark on the genre and even deconstruct the formula that would go on to form the basis of every entry in the franchise - including itself, despite its best efforts - while also never even remotely reaching the heights of its predecessor. In-between its select moments of true suspense, frustratingly frenzied action and generally enjoyable moments centred around dinosaur danger is an uneven and, at times, dull film full of bizarre plot-points and an unnecessary third-act that straight-up shatters all credibility (or perhaps even good-will) built up before it. It's all done with the right intentions, though. This, along with its continued technical prowess, actually makes the final result all the more disappointing. Perhaps if it didn't follow such a masterpiece, it wouldn't have been such a let-down. 6/10",The Lost World - Jurassic Park
45,ThomasDrufke,"Redundant, and Inconsistent",5,10 April 2014,"I really don't feel like Steven Spielberg wanted to make this film. And for everybody involved it was just a straight money grab. I really enjoyed the first Jurassic Park film and for a 1993 flick, its about as visually entertaining as a film can be. But this one felt too similar and so much didn't make any sense.First off, why do they not say at all in the first film that there is a second Island? And if that family in the very beginning of the movie is on vacation there, you would think people taking them there would know the Island history? I also felt as though the idea that people still want to visit this Island knowing there are deadly animals there is preposterous. There were a few times in the movie where I felt like it was going to end and didn't, particularly with the last 20 minutes of the movie. Who approved that man taking the T-Rex back to society? WHY DOES HE STILL WANT TO OPEN A JURASSIC PARK!? I think the inclusion of Vince Vaughn into the mix was a waste. I would have thought they would use him more as comic relief, but essentially he is the same character as Jeff Goldblum's. In fact I would say the chemistry is better between Vaughn and Julianne Moore than with her on screen boyfriend, Goldblum. The whole other story thread with the hunters was also a bore and really wasn't needed. Make this film 90 minutes and I would have rated it higher.With all this being said, I am really looking forward to Jurassic World. With Chris Pratt and Jake Johnson, two of the funniest young actors in the business today, I know it has the potential to be as entertaining as the first movie. I may pass on the third Jurassic Park if its too similar to the first two. There were some parts of Lost World that were great, including the T-Rex scenes. One of the things that was missing from the first movie was more screen time of the big dinosaurs. I found my heart pounding on more than one occasion in those scenes.In a film that has mostly the same scenarios as its predecessor and disappointing climax, you can still find some entertainment with the T-Rex character, which is why I'm not giving it a 2 or 3.5.6/10",The Lost World - Jurassic Park
46,g-bodyl,Good Sequel!,9,24 October 2008,"The Lost World is a nice sequel to watch. In retrospect, it should be based on the book but it's not. Who cares? I sure don't. The story begins with a girl getting attacked by small dinosaurs. Because of the incident, John Hammond sends Ian Malcolm back to the islands to document the island and find his girlfriend. Even if the storyline wasn't developed well, everything makes up for it. The acting is great(Goldblum, Vaughn, Moore). There are new dinosaurs and more T-Rexs. The special effects are great, even by today's standards. John Williams returns with another momentous score. The music is more darker in the film. I think that this movie is even scarier than the first Jurassic Park. I have no idea why people are bashing this movie. I rate this movie 9/10.",The Lost World - Jurassic Park
47,lesleyharris30,"Not Fun or Different Enough to be an Impressive Sequel,",5,20 January 2015,"The Lost World: Jurassic Park is a very mediocre movie with a decent storyline that dosen't try too hard to be different from its predecessor,and a promising cast that sadly didn't seem very inspired.It saddened me that Steven Spielberg actually made this movie because it just didn't feel like he enjoyed making this as much as he did the original Jurassic Park and it seemed like it was only for the sake of money this time around,it also felt like he was mimicking his own work in many parts.While it does look beautiful,it simply isn't as enjoyable story wise and I don't care for these characters as much,Roger Ebert made a great statement when he said that the cast were acting like they were in a movie about dinosaurs,but not like they were experiencing the danger of real dinosaurs,and this is definitely true,save Julianne Moore and Pete Postlethwaite,as these actors really felt like they were doing this movie for the cheque and didn't get too interested in their characters.It has its moments but The Lost World: Jurassic Park is a huge disappointment and I would only recommend it if you really want to finish the series. When a second island of dinosaurs is revealed it arouses the interest of several scientists and mercenaries. Best Performance; Julianne Moore Worst Performance: Richard Schiff",The Lost World - Jurassic Park
48,CuriosityKilledShawn,Found it!,7,2 March 2012,"I enjoyed The Lost World more than Jurassic Park, it's a darker, bloodier film with a higher body count, and, visually, it's a lot more complex. It's a shame that Dean Cundey didn't return (Spielberg never worked with him again, and hired Janusz Kamiński this time around) though. The story is almost the same thing done again, but it doesn't have those awful kids in it...much.Set four years after the Isla Nublar incident, Ian Malcolm is forced by John Hammond to confront the dinos once more on Isla Sorna (or Site B), the place where InGen bred the animals before moving them to Jurassic Park. The InGen board have taken control of the company and prepare to move the dinos to the mainland. But not before 80 minutes of gobbling up the lesser characters. Yes, it's derivative, but it gives us less of what made JP bad, and more of what made it good.There seems to be a lot of trims and cuts to The Lost World. It doesn't make for any distinct continuity errors but there are some noticeable jumps in the pacing. There have been many complaints that the film is overlong, however I think that it's more exciting than the original. There are some nail-biting scenes (the trailers hanging over the cliff) and the dinos are scarier this time. I love the ending with the T-Rex storming around San Diego.Again, there have loads of complaints that this ending is over-the-top, which I think is a ridiculous grievance. Action movies build to a big finish and, since JP1 and JP3 had no climax at all, the Lost World has the best ending of the trilogy. There's no theme of mankind playing God this time, just straight-up action, which also seems like a bit of a waste considering Ian Malcolm's cerebral analysis of the situation on Site A. There are some attempts at character arcs, but they fall flat. I really don't care about Pete Postlethwaite suddenly becoming disillusioned after capturing the T-Rex, and they missed the opportunity for Malcolm to tell them 'I told you so' when chaos erupts. And am I the only one who got confused at the fact that the characters of Ludlow and Ajay look virtually identical? Bad casting choices there, man.Despite all of this, I still think The Lost World is better than the first, even if all the cons negate the pros, it doesn't have those horrible children (apart from 3 minutes at the start).",The Lost World - Jurassic Park

50,The-Sarkologist,It's All About the T-Rex,5,27 April 2020,"One of the interesting things that I find when it comes to sequels is that they tend to start dropping some of the big name characters from the original film, and continue with the lesser know actors. This was certainly the case with this one, with Sam Neill disappearing, and Jeff Goldblum taking the centre stage. Mind you, it doesn't always happen this way, but it does make me think what will happen when I get around to watching the third movie (if I ever do).Anyway, the one thing that always found odd was how long it would take for a dinosaur to reach its maximum size, though ironically, after a quick search on the internet the current theory is actually not that long. In fact, there are suggestions that the T-Rex took only twenty years to reach its size. Mind you, I still sort of wander about the time spans with regards to this film, especially since it is actually mentioned that the founder of Jurassic park came up with the idea 15 years beforehand, which still wouldn't have given the T-rexes (and the other huge dinosaurs) all that much time to grow to the size that they did.Actually, there are quite a few inconsistencies in this film that I picked up. For instance, there is the suggestion that the movie takes place on another island, one where the dinosaurs weren't locked up in a park as they were in the first film. Yet, as the movie progresses, they suddenly end up at this place that looks a lot like the control centre from the first film, which made me wonder how they managed to get there. Okay, they walked, but it still really didn't make all that much sense.Mind you, I guess the main thing about this film is the fact that at the end we have a T-Rex running around downtown San Diago. Yeah, this is what I suspect the film was building up to, and while it might have been a little rushed, we probably should remember that maybe they were sort of trying to steer away from it being too much like Godzilla. Yeah, that's sort of what I was thinking when we had the scenes of the escaped T-rex.I guess this is just one of those films that I would consider dinosaur porn, namely a film that is designed to get people who like dinosaurs really excited. Then again, I also suspect that it is still a kids movie, namely because there isn't really much in the way of blood and gore, though of course they do have people get eaten on camera, but not to the extent that you see in some movies. Then again, it is rated PG-13, so that probably tells you a lot about it.Yeah, I can't say that I was all the impressed with it, though a part of me still wants to watch the next one, namely so that I can then move onto the Jurassic World series. However, as I mentioned, it really isn't that great, and a part of me is dreading the next in the series.",The Lost World - Jurassic Park

A Box Office sequel. The whole site B idea is awful. We seen eggs hatch and all the Dino DNA on the island in the first one. Lazy. Lazy. Lazy. And, because it doesn't offer anything new or innovative, it seems rather familiar and almost boring.It does have some cool bits. The image of the trail of the raptors approaching the survivors in the field looks great. The trailer over the cliff sequence looked good and was intense when Moore was on the glass, but over all it made little sense and was just one of the movies many action sequences. The human character are as cardboard as they come, and are scripted to do stupid things (than nobody would ever do in this situation) so the dinosaurs can chase and eat them.An awful lot of it is set at night!! The night scenes allow Spielberg to use his most familiar visual trademark, the visible beams from powerful flashlights. Another Spielberg trademark is the absent Dad (this time played by Goldblum) Even a press conference announcing a dinosaur park is held at night.

55,tomgillespie2002,Has little of the original's heart,4,22 October 2015,"My main memory of seeing Steven Spielberg's sequel to his 1993 mega- hit Jurassic Park is leaving the cinema with one of the worst migraines I've ever suffered. My head pounded so hard that I couldn't even eat my caramel sundae purchased from the drive-thru McDonalds on the route home. Seeing it again all these years later I approached the film with a clear head and a box of painkillers on hand as a precaution. But as the credits rolled after an exhausting 129 minutes, I found myself in pain yet again. Not pain of the physical kind, but the dull emotional pain of sitting through a pretty bad movie. The Lost World's aim is to make everything bigger and better, and while the dinosaurs are certainly more technically impressive this time, there is little of the original's magic here.A few years after the incident on Isla Nublar, the InGen corporation are being hit with lawsuit after lawsuit, and former CEO John Hammond (Richard Attenborough) is now a naturalist who has seen the error of his ways. When Hammond's slimy nephew (Arliss Howard) takes over the business, he plans to bring the dinosaurs back to the mainland and make them a sideshow attraction. Dr. Ian Malcolm (Jeff Goldblum) is asked by Hammond to visit Isla Sorna, or ""site B"" - a breeding island where the dinosaurs roamed free - to document the dinosaurs in order to gather support for the island to be left to its own devices by humans. He initially declines, but then has a change of heart when he learns that his palaeontologist girlfriend Sarah Harding (Julianne Moore) is already there.Everything is certainly on a larger scale here than its predecessor. Instead of one tyrannosaurus rex we get two and a baby, and there's a whole pack of velociraptors for the group to contend with. Shortly after Malcolm arrives, he and his crew are joined by the Hammond nephew, who brings along a small army and bad-ass hunter Roland Tembo (Pete Postlethwaite), the latter of whom simply wants a shot at taking down a T-Rex as payment for his services. Unfortunately, Malcolm's estranged daughter Kelly (Vanessa Lee Chester) - a character taken straight out of Cinema's Guide to Annoying Children - also sneaks along for the ride, so we get to suffer through sentimental moments of learning the importance of family. The stand- out scene, which sees the characters attacked by the angry T-Rex's near the edge of a cliff, happens because Sarah takes their baby to bandage a wound. It turns out the dinosaurs value family too.The fact that Sarah, an expert in her field, would even try to take care of a baby T-Rex demonstrates how stupid these characters are required to be in order for the film to deliver a set-piece. When you know there are huge, angry monsters out there, why would you park your trailer next to a cliff-edge anyway? So concerned is the film with entertaining its audience, Spielberg and writer David Koepp seem to have forgotten that a scene also requires a degree of logic to truly work. Most of the action falls flat, which is surprising given the talent for the genre previously demonstrated by its director, and it culminates in an unnecessary T-Rex rampage around San Diego. It isn't all bad - the dinosaurs are as wonderful and terrifying as ever and the late Postlethwaite is a fantastically conflicted antagonist - but there's a noticeable lack of heart and effort here.",The Lost World - Jurassic Park

58,zkonedog,Jurassic Park II: The Lost Plot,4,11 March 2017,"The first Jurassic Park film worked because it focused on the morality of the entire situation, with the dinosaurs playing a supporting role (though quite a large one, considering the incredible visual effects). Unfortunately, the sequel does not hold true to this formula, and instead has idiotic characters doing inane tasks, all the while showcasing the roaring dinos and, in the end, turning into little more than Godzilla.For a basic plot summary, ""The Lost World"" reveals the existence of another island, not disclosed in the original, where the dinosaurs were originally ""bred"" and now live in their own contained environment. Of course, bloodthirsty, money-hungry poaches are out to destroy the ecological paradise, so Dr. Ian Malcolm (Jeff Goldblum), the only significant character to reprise his role from the original, and girlfriend Dr. Sarah Harding (Julianne Moore) are sent in to investigate. As expected, things go awry and a certain key species of the dinosauric terrors ends up a bit close to home for comfort.The trouble with this film is that it has absolutely no semblance of a plot. None whatsoever. Whereas the original really inspired viewers to think about the morality at stake in Dr. Hammond's experiments, this sequel only focuses on the ""oohs"" and ""aahs"" at the incredibly life-life dinosaurs to be had by potential viewers. In fact, by the end of the film, the script has devolved into nothing better than King Kong or Godzilla fare.That being said, I will give this film two stars instead of one because, gosh darn it, those dinos ARE pretty impressive! Though a bit of the ""wow"" factor has worn off since the first installment, when the T-Rex roars or the Velociraptors begin preying, the hair on the back of your neck will stand up once again. I honestly don't know if the effects could be any better, even in today's Hollywood.Overall, though, this is a terribly constructed sequel that focuses on all the wrong things. It opened to tremendous hype and made a lot of money initially, but the passage of time has shown it to be quite subpar. I'm amazed that a film directed by a legend such as Steven Spielberg could turn out so vapid.",The Lost World - Jurassic Park
59,johnnyboyz,"Much more cluttered, far less enjoyable dinosaur island romp loosely trying expand on the first but also head in fresh directions - it just ends up blunt and uninteresting.",5,12 September 2011,"Author Edwin Page has American director Quentin Tarantino quoted as saying, upon the 1997 release of Jackie Brown - his third film, that after being asked how he would go about ""topping"" his preceding release Pulp Fiction, Tarantino replied that he didn't think he would, and thus tried ""deliberatley"" to go ""underneath"" his 1994 crime film masterwork; to try and undercut what was a large-and-in-charge genre piece with something a little subtler and a little more underplayed but both equally as substantial and enthralling. It's too bad Spielberg's Jurassic Park sequel came out as early on in the calender year of 1997 as it did, since a similar train of thought needs to be applied to it; the film, a mouthful in itself entitled The Lost World: Jurassic Park, wanting to go bigger and better than that of its 1993 blockbuster counterpart with larger clumps of characters; more monsters and a heavy later reliance on off-the-wall content which isn't even set on dystopian islands as much as it comes across as the director patting himself on the back for being able to pay homage to Godzilla.Returning from the first film is Jeff Goldblum's doctor of mathematics Ian Malcolm, a man now riding subways to meet with the entrepreneur of the last film's titular Jurassic Park, John Hammond (Attenborough), at his stately home home rather than travelling with said gentleman on helicopters to touch down on tropical paradises rich with the latest scientific breakthroughs. Times are tough for Malcolm, his whistle blowing on what happened in the first film has people ignominiously confront or stare at him, whilst his funding from certain institutes has been cut due to these ill received tales. The company predominantly behind Hammond's enterprise, InGen, appear to be taking over; their grey suits and blunt tones replacing that of the kindly elderly man act Hammond fronts for the organisation, as we observe him worn and somewhat frail.The reason for Malcolm's summoning lies with the fact a second site of dinosaurs and such is becoming a nuisance, a second site verbally established as this locale less secure than that of the first film's and much more dangerous; a place Hammond desires Malcolm to venture toward so as to lay claim to it prior to InGen's newfound fondness to exploit. He is only convinced upon discovering girlfriend Sarah Harding, played by Julianne Moore, has already gone there by herself. A scene in a large warehouse full of technology and equipment is meant to help quell fears of these characters not being able to deal with the dinosaur threat, a threat put across during the film's very first scene in which a child wonders from her rich, holidaying family and is mauled by some of the smaller beasties the result of this second site – that sense of the yet unseen larger ones probably capable of a lost worse prominent.Malcolm is stuck with an infant of his own, that of Kelly (Lee Chester), whom came about as the result of his Lothario nature he established himself to possess in the first film. He has a rift with Kelly - like the Alan Grant character and his problem with children in the first film, there is a brief alluding to how they cannot quite connect with one another, and we are lead into wondering if what later transpires within their collative quest will help quell that. We are correct to, but it isn't evident enough throughout the film to actually amount to anything special, and certainly isn't enough in the way of character substance to carry the picture. Goldblum's character is the audience's beacon of recognition once everyone is on the island. Around him are nobodies in the form of his underexposed daughter and two nothing supporting acts in photographer Nick (Vaughn) and weapons expert Eddie (Schiff). Goldblum, a veteran of the first film in the mould of what we are, provides warnings and reiterations toward the supporting acts-plus their sense of being awestruck upon first seeing the prehistorical creatures. These are humorous and self reflective of how easily we were once caught up in the first film and its respective bringing to life of these creatures prior to being caught out by the terror of it all.The film is a mostly underwhelming experience, an exercise in second unit direction that does not carry the wonder of the first nor the sense of craft at work which was wholly evident during the first film. Not long after InGen's own team have arrived with pomp and circumstance does the film wane; Eddie's justification that he doesn't want to shoot a dinosaur threatening one of his own team out of the fact it's protecting its young in stark contrast to InGen's ravaging of certain dinosaur hordes for their own prerogatives. One set piece sees Spielberg manage to riff on the first film too much in one go to keep the film feeling distanced enough from its 1993 cousin, a set piece in which the mud and the rain and the dark act as backdrops to a hapless character trying to tie a tow chord around a tree as a truck hovers agonisingly over the side of a cliff – all this whilst hostile variants of the dinosaurs located therein loom in the area. Where it wants to go broader and better, it just comes off as slack and goofy; a film lacking the rawness and wonder of the first and just ending up confused and sporadic in ways that are, frankly, quite dull.",The Lost World - Jurassic Park
60,filipemanuelneto,Uninteresting.,5,5 September 2015,"It is a sequel to the movie ""Jurassic Park"" and narrates a journey of a team of scientists and paleontologists to an island near the park, where they have build part of its scientific facilities, now abandoned and left to the dinosaurs. However, they will find another team of explorers with less scientific intentions. Directed by Steven Spielberg, this film has a screenplay by David Koepp, contrary to what happened in the first film, which Spielberg took on the role of screenwriter. The cast, however, remains more or less the same as the first film (except those who died in the first film, of course) and keeps a very interesting level and performance.Many film experts say that sequels are rarely able to have the impact and the mystique of the first film. And if we analyze this case we see that they are right to say that. The change of writer caused a catastrophe in the film and doesn't allow it reaches a level similar to the first, ended up being a movie much less interesting and enjoyable, although it also have some positive notes in between. He even has perfectly boring scenes, virtually copied from the first film. The end, with an angry dinosaur in the middle of a city, is so far-fetched and predictable that turns out to be more appropriate for a ""Godzilla"" movie. Personally, I didn't feel surprised.

65,Anonymous_Maxine,"What did you expect, BETTER than Jurassic Park?",10,30 January 2001,"Okay fine, it's not as great as Jurassic Park, but The Lost World still came out as a quality dinosaur film. Keep in mind that the special effects and computer graphics are still virtually unparalleled in this kind of film, and I think that they did a good job presenting the story. Luckily, Stephen Spielberg agreed to direct a sequel to the tremendously successful original, because even though I think that potential disaster did not necessarily lie with the choice of directors, if he did not want to do it the whole movie could have been screwed up. I'm not saying that Spielberg is the only guy who could have directed this film successfully - I'm sure plenty of other directors could have done it - but Spielberg has such an undying fascination and love for dinosaurs, and I think that it shows in these films. If you listen to him talk about how he got into the whole Jurassic Park scenario and why he chose to do the films and why he likes dinosaurs so much, the guy sounds like a little kid because he gets so excited, and on top of that, he's a spectacular director. Those, not to mention a huge budget, good actors, and a quality special effects team, are the ingredients of a good dinosaur movie.On the screen, however, it's Jeff Goldblum who steals the whole show, just like he did in Jurassic Park. He is back as the ingenious and highly entertaining Ian Malcolm, the ""chaotician"" who is around to point out the dangers in harnessing live dinosaurs in a park, no matter how isolated. Probably one of the only things that The Lost World doesn't do as well as Jurassic Park is surprise the audience. (spoilers?) When you watch The Lost World for the first time, you KNOW that there are going to be dinosaur attacks and people getting killed, etc. In short, you basically know within the first 20 minutes of the movie that Malcolm will be exactly right about his predictions of what will happen on the ""new"" island. So in this case, the fun part of the movie is seeing what they came up with to put into the sequel to the great Jurassic Park.I think that most of the credit should probably go to Michael Crichton for the quality novel that he wrote as a sequel to Jurassic Park, because this was by far the most important part of this movie. We already know that they can make the dinosaurs real, now the challenge is to make a second movie that is as engaging as the first, while using mostly the same technology. And obviously, this requires a seriously impressive story. Luckily, they left enough of a loophole in Jurassic Park so that a whole second island could be snuck in  the island on which all of the dinosaurs were hatched and raised for the early part of their lives BEFORE being transported to Jurassic Park. The conflicting interests about what to do with the dinosaurs provides for the majority of the story here. You have foolish bounty hunters who want a freakin' Tyrannosaur ALIVE, you have ignorant scientists trying to study the dinosaurs like everyday predators, you have the great Vince Vaughn (shut up, he rocks) there as a `plan B' in case anything gets out of hand, and of course, you have Ian Malcolm there telling everyone that they are wrong and should leave as soon as possible, which everyone in the audience knows, but it's okay that we all already know that. What you get with all of this is a film that does not live up to the stunning success of its predecessor, but that is still able to stand easily on its own. Stephen Spielberg provided just as much skill in his direction as in the original, and the acting all around, even from the unknown actors, was very good. All of this combines with Michael Crichton's excellent story, just the right amount of comic relief, and plenty of gory action to make another superior dinosaur film.",The Lost World - Jurassic Park
66,jzappa,"Ah, the Good Old Days",10,18 August 2008,"There is something about a Hollywood blockbuster entertainment with Spielberg at the helm. The script is never quite as ridiculous, the effects are never quite as deflecting, the acting never quite as phoned in as, say, a Roland Emmerich or Michael Bay picture. This intense sequel, an inimitable essence of the 1990s, is the sort of movie that pure entertainments once were, and that is the sort of escape, release, leisure every so often. The film's star is one of the most lovable actors in the world, the wry and able full-time comic charmer Jeff Goldblum, who is a clear indication of the movie's era, which, believe it or not, has passed us by already.Perhaps it's more satisfying for me to watch a blockbuster from my childhood rather than those that are being released today. Yet, I don't suspect it's entirely the nostalgia, because the movie seemed no more or less pleasing now than when I saw it at age nine, a larger- than-life gorefest of magnificent, painful suspense in a packed theater with my cringing mother. It could also be that the tiresome blockbusters in more recent years are perhaps recycled goods that, while they grow with the developing technology, refuse to grow with audience's experience with such similar stories and dying ingenuity. Spielberg's stop- motion, ridiculous corny dialogue back when it wasn't yet so corny and wasn't yet quite so riddled with cheap gratuity, and bygone use of a memorable orchestral score are the true welcome escapes.Moreover, the Jurassic Park films, The Lost World being by far the most fulfilling one, demonstrate a significant implication that may hopefully be heeded by the youngsters who routinely go through phases with the giant Hollywood franchises such as this, one of letting nature run its course gracefully, to leave nature be, to recognize the harm, vanity, infection, and especially the danger in exploiting it and forcing it out of its biological process. This is something Michael Bay has not, will not, and does not want to do. Yet it's something that Steven Spielberg has always done, planting good-natured seeds in the young generations throughout which he's made an impact.",The Lost World - Jurassic Park

68,FiendishDramaturgy,Almost as good as the original!,9,30 September 2003,"While this movie was not quite the same brilliant combination of effects, cast, characters and magic Spielberg delivered in the first production, I still found this sequel just as enjoyable as the first.The cast members are just as professional, and while they did not have the same original cast (a mistake most sequels make), Dr. Ian Malcolm (Jeff Goldblum) does return. That was fine by me. He as my favorite character from the first movie, anyway. Joined byJulianne Moore as Dr. Sarah Harding and Vanessa Lee Chester who brilliantly portrayed Malcolm's daughter, Kelly, they attempt to recreate the magic of ""Jurassic Park.""While they did not quite succeed in accomplishing the totality of the first, they did present the world with an excellent finished product which I found extremely fun to watch and highly entertaining.Plot: John Hammond is at it again, but this time, he is on the side of the environmentalist. InGen has been taken out of his control and he must stop his nephew from exploiting the dinosaurs kept as breeding stock for a possible second attempt at Jurassic Park's opening.Hammond already has a team on the island to observe and ensure that his nephew does not interfere with the island's inhabitants; ie: the dinosaurs created by Hammond and the InGen team of genetic scientists. During the course of his conversation with Dr. Malcolm, whose reputation is now ruined because of the controversy behind his tales of the disastrous trek to Isla Nebular, Hammond discloses that the new team is not on Isla Nebular, but on a secret island developed as ""Site B,"" called Isla Sorna which is 87 miles south of the original site.Naturally, Malcolm refuses to go (who wouldn't!) and is on his way out when Hammond reveals that Malcolm's girlfriend, Dr. Sarah Harding, is already on the island as part of the research team.""This is no longer a research mission. It's a rescue mission, and it's leaving right NOW!"" Dr. Ian Malcolm.The dinosaurs were done just as wonderfully in this fine sequel, as in the original; the dialogue was just as witty and clever; the characters were just as believable and well developed; and you honestly did not have to be witness to the first movie to fully enjoy this one. The only things that were lacking, for me, were (1) the wonderful cinematography; those excellent landscapes which were prevalent in the first. This one felt more deliberate; less spontaneous, than its predecessor. That was due to (2) one badly-developed, poorly portrayed character, and unfortunately, he was one of the leading characters in the script. Arliss Howard as Peter Ludlow, John Hammond's egocentric nephew. I am unsure as to whether his acting quality was trite and stiff, or his character was written that way, but whatever it was, it did disrupt the quality of the movie, in my opinion. These two things combined, lowers my opinion of the movie, but only in comparison to the original, and only a little bit.This is still a very good sequel which stands alone without depending on the first plot to carry it.It earns an 8.6/10 from...the Fiend :.",The Lost World - Jurassic Park
69,alindsay-al,An Average Sequel that fails to capture the magic of the first film.,6,22 May 2018,"After the amazing Jurassic Park a sequel was inevitable and in 1997 this film Jurassic Park: The Lost World was released and it is a pretty disappointing film to watch to be honest. The premise of the film sees a small team travel to a twin island of the island from the first film to see what dinosaurs are alive. Going from supporting character to the lead is Jeff Goldblum as Dr Ian Malcolm and of course he is great in this film. It helps that I love him as an actor but Malcolm is the only character actually talking sense in this film and that you end up caring about. The supporting cast is completely different in this film, I actually liked Vince Vaughan in his role in the film, he had that snarky demeanour about him that we have grown to know but he gave a bit of depth to the role as well. I also really liked Pete Postlethwaite in this film, he plays a ruthless hunter in the film and I totally bought him in this role and thought he did a really goof job. However, Julianne Moore plays Goldblum's girlfriend in this film and I found her really annoying. Her character comes across as being overly arrogant and I didn't buy her and Goldblum's chemistry at all. Also I didn't care about the whole daughter character and felt it was shoehorned in to try and add some heart to the film that just isn't there. The story for me was the weakest part of the film, I felt like the whole plot just feels like an excuse to get these characters back on an island without much real interesting motivations. Also the last act of the film feels like a different film and doesn't fit very well with the overall plot of the film. The script has some decent humour in it especially from Goldblum, even though I don't feel like it worked as much as the first film. The drama doesn't hit anywhere near as much as the previous film and I think that is why I didn't really care about this film. The style of the film still has some decent CGI Dinosaurs in it even though again it doesn't feel as marvellous as the first film. Also I feel like the pacing is a bit of an issue as this film feels about 20 minutes too long for sure. Overall this is a step down from the original film and its not that bad but is just a bit uninspiring and not memorable.",The Lost World - Jurassic Park

The best part of the movie is that you don't have to wait for long to see the dinosaurs as they are introduced quite early in comparison to it's first part.Acting is great and all the characters had done a decent job. Screenplay of the movie is good but it starts getting bore and slow in between but tightens the grip as the movie approaches to it's climax.VFX and cinematography is good and climax is also good although could've been little shorter and crispier.

71,barnabyrudge,Contrived sequel with good effects and effective passages of excitement.,6,7 January 2007,"This inevitable sequel to Jurassic Park is a pretty enjoyable movie with excellent special effects and frequent moments of tension. If you study the structure of the film closely, you'll notice that it not only presents itself as a sequel to the earlier film but also resembles a loose remake of King Kong. There are a few misjudgements in the movie, just little things that undermine the overall impact, but generally-speaking it hits its targets with the kind of slick, consummate efficiency that characterises most Steven Spielberg films.Dr Ian Malcolm (Jeff Goldblum), a survivor from the original adventure  see ""Jurassic Park"",  is summoned by entrepreneur John Hammond (Richard Attenborough). Hammond confesses that a second genetically-engineered dinosaur island exists out in the Pacific. It seems that some of the breeding experiments for the original Jurassic Park were carried out on this other island, but scientists are baffled by the way the dinosaurs have flourished and somehow adapted to their habitat without any interference from mankind. A team of scientists is out on the island observing the dinosaurs for research purposes and Hammond wishes Malcolm to join them. Initially against the idea, Malcolm soon finds himself forced into it when he learns that his girlfriend Dr Sarah Harding (Julianne Moore) is already out there leading the field study, blissfully unaware of the potential danger she faces. Malcolm heads out to join her and is relieved to find that so far everything on the island seems to be under control. Soon all that changes as a team of hunters turn up led by Peter Ludlow (Arliss Howard) and ace hunter Roland Tembo (Pete Postlethwaite). The hunters are on a mission to capture various breeds of dinosaur and take them back to San Diego where a new Jurassic tourist attraction has been built. Malcolm's group face a perilous journey to escape from the island, but worse is to follow as the hunters foul-up their attempt to transport a living T-Rex into San Diego.Perhaps the main misjudgement with this film is the excessively contrived plot. It was virtually certain from the moment the first film was a smash hit at the box office that a sequel would turn up. But in order to provide this sequel with a basic storyline, too many unconvincing story elements have had to be constructed and too many improbable events and coincidences punctuate the film. The climactic sequence in which a T-Rex rampages through San Diego is also a step too far. The film ought to end when Malcolm's group escape from the island, but instead a 25-minute final sequence is tacked on. It's clear that this final sequence is intended to pay homage to King Kong, the ultimate prehistoric-monster-on-the-loose-in-modern-times story, but it jars with all that has gone before. Still, The Lost World: Jurassic Park has plenty to keep viewers entertained. The performances are very enjoyable, especially Goldblum and Postlethwaite, and the dinosaur effects are outstanding. Certain scenes are genuinely thrilling, especially during the section of the film set on the island. Moore's hair-raising escape from a trailer as it is attacked by a T-Rex on the brink of a cliff is real edge-of-the-seat stuff, while the heroes' final desperate effort to reach a rescue helicopter whilst pursued by velociraptors is similarly pulsating. The Lost World: Jurassic Park is a slick, packaged, effortlessly watchable thrill-ride.",The Lost World - Jurassic Park

73,slokes,Rooting For The Dinosaurs,2,1 November 2017,"The first ""Jurassic Park"" was all about the science of bringing dinosaurs back to life. ""The Lost World"" is about the ethics of same. Ethics have always been tricky territory where Hollywood is concerned. That's true here, too.Four years after InGen populated an entire island with dinosaurs, the company finds itself on the ropes. Wrongful death suits are expensive; so is bad publicity. Ian Malcolm (Jeff Goldblum) goes from horrified onlooker to potential hors d'oeuvre when he travels to Isla Sorna to persuade his paleontologist girlfriend Sarah Harding (Julianne Moore) to come back home with him.Director Steven Spielberg called this film ""my first pure sequel,"" noting his Indiana Jones films are more like installments in an adventure series. But ""The Lost World"" fails miserably as a sequel, offering none of the joy of discovery while doubling up on carnage. It is a weird, grim spectacle film where logic in thrown out and characterization reduced to the broadest strokes.The question I am left with: Are we supposed to be rooting for the dinosaurs? The pro-forma good guys are a motley crew of SJWs whose constant virtue-signaling is about the only thing audible over the raptor roars. In between snuggling up to a baby stegosaurus and bringing an injured T. Rex into her trailer, Dr. Harding lectures a photographer not to smoke a cigarette on the island. ""We're here to observe and document, not interact,"" she tells him.Spielberg could have made a good movie out of this if he dispensed with the idea of making Harding his hero, rather than a big part of the problem. The photographer turns out to be a Greenpeace operative, and we watch him and Harding release some captured dinosaurs which then trample through a camp of fellow humans. They are hunters, so this is apparently positive behavior, even if this ""ethical"" sabotage winds up killing most of the people we see.The CGI is more active here than it was in the first film, and much more artificial-looking. Spielberg's A-Team, composer John Williams and cinematographer Janusz Kamiński, plod through the motions in delivering a lot of mood and odd triumphant tones which feel hollow even as they are delivered. The whole film fails as a transportive enterprise, reminding you of past glories while adding nothing new.There's one performance I really liked in the film. It's not Pete Postlethwaite as Roland the hunter, which everyone else including Spielberg loved; he's a cipher too hemmed in by the silly script. Rather, it's Arliss Howard as Peter Ludlow, nephew of John Hammond (Richard Attenborough), who as acting head of InGen is trying to use the dinosaurs to repair his shattered business, and doesn't care who gets hurt in the process.Howard is so smoothly smug and mean, I found myself seeking him out in group scenes. He's really not much of a villain, since his motives are less evil than capitalist (the same thing in Spielberg's world, maybe, but not mine), but he adds the right notes of conflict whenever given the chance, like when Malcolm grabs his arm in an early scene to make a point: ""This suit costs more than your education.""Howard doesn't do much villain work, so I was happily impressed enough to give him my 1997 Doe Avedon Award for great performance in a bad movie.What passes for a plot involves watching the various name characters try to avoid the same brutal fate they bestow on those who meet them, and then try and save an angry T. Rex storming through San Diego. This latter piece is so tacked on it betrays ""Lost World's"" focus on being an effects film. The original ""Jurassic Park"" was that, too, but the storycraft was good enough to keep you watching.No luck here. ""The Lost World"" is as much a slaughterhouse of ideas as it is of people. We can argue about whether Spielberg ever made a worse film (""1941,"" perhaps), but this stands supreme as his most disappointing.",The Lost World - Jurassic Park
74,gcd70,Entertaining and unbelievable,7,28 June 2008,"As entertaining, and as unbelievable, as the first is Spielberg's return to rampant, DNA induced Dino's, ""The Lost World"".I guess a sequel was inevitable, as is the final twenty minutes of this film. Surprises are supplied in the script, yet most of the action sequences lack imagination. Only the very early scenes impress, the initial encounters being at times thrilling, especially the scene in which the T-Rex's shove twin trailers over a cliff.Special effects again take the limelight, but we've seen it all before, so the affect is diminished. John Williams score makes a welcome return, and his aural composition is supported by great cinematography.Dr. Malcolm (Jeff Goldblum) returns from ""Jurassic Park"", and is now the hero of the moment. Goldblum plays well the mathematician who is decidedly unenthusiastic about being among the deadly dinosaurs. Much more keen is his new g.f., played by the likable Julianne Moore. She is the palaeontologist who volunteers to observe the dinosaurs in their natural habitat and make recordings for entrepreneur Sir Richard Attenborough. Vince Vaughn forms part of this passive group. Heading up an opposing, aggressive band who plan to capture and export the beasts is Pete Postlethwaite, portraying most enjoyably the great white hunter who longs to stalk a male T-Rex.Leave it to Spielberg to recreate the excitement, drama and thrills of the first film. A shame about the closing thirty minutes though.Sunday, July 13, 1997 - Knox District Centre",The Lost World - Jurassic Park
75,TOMNEL,"Pales in comparison to the first, and even to the third.",5,31 May 2008,"If looked at alone, this Jurassic Park, is a technical marvel. The computer generated dinosaurs are fantastic looking, and even better are the animatronics that seem as real as any human character here. The direction is about as good as it can be, and obviously Steven Spielberg knows how to direct a good flick. However, in the future maybe he should spruce up the script a bit before filming just anything. ""The Lost World"" Jurassic Park"" tries to have a heart as big as the first movie's, but when your whole story is based around an uncaring sarcastic comedian, it's kind of hard.Dr. Ian Malcom (Jeff Goldblum), the character who worked so well in the first movie but falls flat here, is back for more crazy adventures. John Hammond (Richard Attenbrough), creator of Jurassic Park reveals to him a second island full of dinosaurs, and Malcom goes to the island to retrieve his annoying girlfriend Sarah (Julianne Moore), and ends up meeting some dinosaur poachers. The climax of the film involves a tranquilized Tyrannasaurus Rex being brought to San Diego, and of course escaping and causing chaos.Ian Malcom was great in the first Jurassic Park but not so great here...why is this? In the first movie, we had a wide range of characters with different personalities to root for or against. Here, we have him, his girlfriend, his stowaway adopted daughter, and the one dimensional poachers who everyone could care less about. Not much to choose from in the character department. The heart that we got to see from the first movie, particularly in the extremely sweet ending, is missing completely. This movie is all talking and action. And the action scenes are fantastic. The T-Rex going around San Diego is a great scene. The raptors trying to dig into a building is somewhat pulse pounding, as is the scene where men try going through tall grass inhabited by raptors. One scene involving an RV looks great, and in this way I can say this entire movie was built to be a roller-coaster ride film. And it would have the same thrills from the first film, if only it had some likable characters. Even the third film succeeds in that department.If this is looked at as anything but nonstop scenes of dino action, it's bad, and in the end, this was a very mediocre film.My rating: ** out of ****. 123 mins.

No one wants to hear about the mother-father, lovey-dovey, flower child-hippie dialogue! So what! They're big, nasty animals that can kill and eat you! I will say this, Pete Postlethwaite was great as the hunter, bent on capturing himself a T-Rex. However, one of my questions is: What happened to Vince Vaughn after they escaped? He pretty much disappeared from the movie. Nonetheless, this movie proved to be a brutal mistake, one that should not have been punctuated on.",The Lost World - Jurassic Park

Jeff Goldblum gives a great performance and Vince Vaughn, Julianne Moore and Pete Postlethwaite are all really good. The CG and use of practical effects are incredible and still hold up really well. Steven Spielberg's direction is excellent with some extremely impressive long takes and suspenseful scenes. The music by John Williams is amazing.",The Lost World - Jurassic Park
78,Spleen,These days people don't even bother to disguise the fact that they're just making the sequel for the money,3,4 November 2000,"I can understand if they wanted to make another movie about dinosaurs, but why all those tedious links to Jurassic Park?  Why BOTHER resurrecting four of the old characters - the two kids, I note, make a three-minute appearance, cash their cheques, then vanish without a trace - just to let us know that this film takes place in the same universe as the previous one? It's not we were the slightest bit curious at the end of ""Jurassic Park"" what would happen next to any of the old characters.  It's not even as if they're worth meeting a second time.  -Well, perhaps I could have lived through another outing with Sam Neill's palaeontologist, but nooo, instead I have to put up with Jeff Goldblum's unconvincing, insufferable, sunglass-wearing mathematician.  (Why him, Lord?  Why him?)  And the title - ""The Lost World"" - adds insult to injury, for it suggests a far better dinosaur movie that might have been, based on Arthur Conan Doyle's book. Trust me: if they had made a dinosaur movie out of THAT ""Lost World"" rather than Crichton's, it may still have been bad, but it couldn't possibly have been THIS bad.  (P.S.: Crichton had no right to pinch Conan Doyle's title.)Even allowing for Crichton and Spielberg their initial mistake the first half hour was poorly conceived.  Talk about leaden exposition.  Every character is given several paragraphs' worth of pointless, computer-generated back story.  Kelly - Dr. Ian Malcolm's daughter - feels as if Ian is neglecting his duties as a father, while Ian fools himself into believing that the important thing is to grant Kelly as much freedom as possible; similarly, in his relationship with Sarah, blah, blah, blah.  I DON'T CARE.  This is a story about the struggle between man and dinosaur. As soon as the razor-toothed beasties begin to stomp around all of these soap opera hand-me-downs will be forgotten anyway; during that ENDLESS first act they simply clog the film's arteries.  -When will people learn?  In a Human vs. Dinosaur story you reveal the humans' feelings towards one AFTER the dinosaurs strike; you let the external struggle illuminate the characters' inner lives AS THE PLOT PROGRESSES.  -I mean, there's nothing aesthetically shameful about external, physical struggles.  You don't need to import any of this human relationship stuff to make your film respectable.  But if you MUST do so, INTEGRATE IT! ... I can't say I was very impressed with the dinosaur bits, either.  Too many people on the island, too much random stupidity and movement ... and, as you will have heard, the action somehow shifts to San Francisco for the finale.  (San Francisco!  ...and it really does just SHIFT: it's not as if anything new happens.  In mid-dramatic-sentence, they pack up everything, including a tyrannosaurus, cart it all several thousand kilometres, then pick up where they left off.)  I must admit that the greater use of computer-generated creature footage, regrettable per se, was in keeping with the film's aesthetic: computer footage is cold and sterile, but I guess Spielberg wanted his dinosaurs to be no more than soulless killing machines.",The Lost World - Jurassic Park

You can't really turn this sort of entertainment down and it's a fine example of a solid family film.

80,Matt_Layden,Something has survived.,6,14 August 2010,"Think we saw the last of those pesky dinosaurs from the original Jurassic Park? Think again. This time around we are going to another island, called Site B. It's here where the dinosaurs actually run free, no cages. Which means that the filmmakers have up the ante a bit. Our humans are stuck on this island while another group of humans decide to go hunting. For some strange reason the film finishes with the T-REX running around San Diego. How can a film live up to the original? The first was such a huge moment in blockbuster history. Well we are giving no Sam Neil and more Jeff Goldblum. The sequel, is a little too ambitious that it loses itself in all of its grandeur. How could they raise the stakes in this film? Well, for one they thrown the characters into a world that they have absolutely no control over. No cages, no wires or buildings. This is a natural and free environment, this is the dino-environment. Second, we have a freaking T-REX run around San Diego. Yup, to raise the stakes they needed to bring one of those guys back. In a way it feels like a failed King Kong experiment. The Lost World gives fans what they wanted, more raptors. Yet these raptors are different, more deadly apparently. Velociraptors, yippie, yet they can be taken out by a little girl because she is also a gymnast. Yes, people still moan about that scene and there is a good reason for it. It is utterly ridiculous. I can forgive a character being scared of a snake and getting killed by the Rex, but not that damn gymnastic scene.Vince Vaughn is in this flick and I think after this and Psycho, he decided that comedy was his one and only place to be. Sure he tried again with The Cell and Domestic Disturbance, but both films failed. He's not bad here, but he also seems out of his element. I wouldn't mind seeing him in another film like this though, give him another chance, but his strong elements are clearly comedy.Lost World is not as great as the original, but it's also not the travesty people make it out to be. There are many parts in the film that don't live up to the expectations it sets out for itself. The San Diego sequence is insane and you either love it or hate it. I remember seeing this film in the theatres when I was a kid, my opinion of it has lessened since then. I was 10 then, I'm 22 now. It almost feels like the Temple of Doom of the series. It's something kids love but adults seem to roll their eyes at. But that would have to make Jurassic Park III good, when it's just like this one, mediocre.",The Lost World - Jurassic Park
81,brando647,A Worthy Sequel to One of My Favorite Movies,8,7 May 2008,"Steven Spielberg returns with a sequel to his 1993 blockbuster that I believe was under-rated by many people. I loved the film when I first saw it in theaters in 1997 and, while it didn't seem as impressive on second viewing, I still find it to be one of the best sequels I've seen. John Hammond (Richard Attenborough returns for this short cameo) has discovered that some of the dinosaurs originally intended for his park have been surviving on the secondary island, Isla Sorna. Isla Sorna housed the location of Site B, where most of the dinosaurs would be hatched before bringing them over to Isla Nublar and Jurassic Park. Hammond is determined to send a team, led by a more than reluctant Ian Malcolm, to the island to retrieve photographic documentation of the thriving dinosaurs in an effort to gain public support in preserving the location.Just as the first film, this one retains some primary similarities to Michael Crichton's novel but it also takes a lot of liberties. Unlike 'Jurassic Park', I read the book before seeing the film for 'The Lost World' and so I was more aware of what the film COULD have been. Of course, those doesn't mean I didn't love the movie. There were just a lot of great scenes that were cut from the original story to fit into Spielberg's view.Of the cast from the original, the only returning key player is Jeff Goldblum as Ian Malcolm. Malcolm was my favorite character from the first film so it was awesome having him return as the lead. I loved the additions of Vince Vaughn, Pete Postlethwaite, and Peter Stormare to the cast (though Stormare's role was small). Goldblum's one of my favorite actors and teaming him with Vince Vaughn was great. In addition to another great cast, this film gives us more dinosaurs than the previous. The audience gets their first glimpses of stegosaurs and compsognathus. We also get not one but two tyrannosaurs in this film AND they get more screen time this time around.Personally, I don't understand why some people complain about this movie. It's just as fun as the first; I don't quite understand what people feel is missing. I doesn't contain the some sense of wonder as the first film because this time we're already seen the dinosaurs in action. I've heard some complaints about the climactic sequence in San Diego. Aside from the fact that it deviated so much from the book with this sequence, I thought it was awesome. It gave the audience a chance to look at the dinosaurs in a new light, a new environment. I stand by my 8/10 rating because I found this movie to be a worthwhile sequel to one of my favorite movies.",The Lost World - Jurassic Park
82,valadas,Just passable,5,17 May 2009,"This story of a mother dinosaur going mad at humans because of the abduction of its young... Well but let's begin at the beginning. Two teams of men are sent to an island not far from Costa Rica inhabited by several species of dinosaurs that Man re-created there (how, when and with what purpose?) to (study them? make some kind of research? hunt them? All the three?). There began at once a fierce fight between predator dinosaurs and men (the worst predators in Earth after all) in a series of thrilling episodes and scenes full of suspense most of them very implausible (even taking for granted the presence of dinosaurs as natural and real). That is to say we have here another action thriller of a fight between men and more or less fantastic predators not worse and not better than lots of other movies of the same kind. A word of praise however, for the dinosaur special effects which are technically very well made and quite convincing in visual terms.",The Lost World - Jurassic Park
83,Terryfan,Jurassic Park returns,8,10 June 2015,"After the success of Jurassic Park it was only a matter of time before we would get a sequel. From what I understand Michael Crichton had no plans for a sequel but Steven Spielberg convince him to write a sequel.What we got was The Lost World. I remember in 1997 how fired up I was to learn we were going to get a sequel to Jurassic Park and I saw it twice in theaters with my family ended up getting a good percent of the toys from the film.Looking back on it I'm surprised the film wasn't given the R Rating considering how this is the most graphic film in the Trilogy and some of the scenes were too much for a PG-13 film. Despite the mix reviews I find it to be a good film sure it's not perfect it does have thrills and action like in the first film and some that are just wow and the only way to give it justice is to watch the film.The film plot this time centers around Ian Malcolm (Jeff Goldblum) who is asked by John Hammond (Richard Attenborough) to lead a research team onto Isla Sorna Site B the team being his girlfriend Sarah Harding (Julianne Moore), Nick Van Owen (Vince Vaughn) and Eddie Carr (Richard Schiff) and Ian's daughter Kelly (Vanessa Lee Chester) who got to study how the Dinosaurs are surviving on the island all the while try and stop Peter Ludlow (Arliss Howard) as he leads a team of hunters lead by Roland Tembo (Pete Postlethwaite),Dieter Stark (Peter Stormare),Ajay Sidhu (Ajay Sidhu), Dr. Robert Burke (Thomas F. Duffy) Carter (Thomas Rosales Jr)Cameo Joseph Mazzello returns as Tim and Ariana Richards returns as Lex for the start of the film. Being that this film takes place four years after Jurassic Park this film had a lot to live up to. The reaction in the theaters back in 1997 was huge so it did something right to get movie fans to be in awe by the film. The film feature some of the most tense scenes ever in a movie with my personal favorite scene is when Ian, Nick and Sarah are hanging over the cliff in their trailers that scene will have your skin crawling and your nerves up high. And the effects for the dinosaurs are once again impressive as they used a mix of Puppet work and C.G.I. In this film you can feel that the Dinosaurs are meant for business each time they are screen you know something is about to happen. That what give the movie a edge when it comes to seeing how the characters react to the Dinosaurs in the film The music once again is amazing, John Williams music always tells a story and this film is no different each score he wrote for this film matches the story and plot each time you hear his music you can tell some love went into these score.The film also features good quotes like ""Predators don't hunt when they're not hungry"" and ""Taking dinosaurs off this island is the worst idea in the long sad history of bad ideas"".The film is pretty dark as this often times feels like a horror film as the scenes can feel that way when you see the predators coming out of hiding you'll be able to understand where I'm coming fromFor the Dinosaurs we get Two Tyrannosaurus Rex one male one female as well as a young one, Compsognathus, Gallimimus,Mamenchisaurus Pachycephalosaurus,Edmontosaurus,Parasaurolophus,Pteranodon Stegosaurus,Triceratops and Velociraptor. Each Dinosaur is amazing to watch on the screen which is why I love the Jurassic Park films.You can tell the film makers love to make these movies While this film did get some mix reviews I found it to be a worthy sequel to Jurassic Park is it perfect? No but it does well with the plot the tense action scenes and stunts the acting is pretty good and the music is amazing to listen to. My advice is to watch the movie for yourself you'll be impress if you just sit back and enjoyI give The Lost World: Jurassic Park an 8 out of 10",The Lost World - Jurassic Park
84,mjw2305,"More of a showpiece than the first, but it's left lacking depth",7,17 January 2007,"It does exactly what it says on the back of the DVD and i quote - 'The blockbuster sequel with even more dinosaurs, more action and more breathtaking visual effects than its record breaking predecessor'However it does this at the expense of the character development and the plot; both of these are compromised to give more screen time to the dinosaurs and the action sequences, so it really comes down to what you are after in a film. If it's fairly good action and stunning CGI dinosaurs and chases that you want, this film delivers; if your after something with a bit more depth then you may be left wanting.Personally i found this was great fun to watch, but i found myself routing for the dinosaurs, they had more character than the cast, don't get me wrong, the cast is sufficient, their just not as compelling to watch as the dinosaurs.7/10 for the fun of the experience",The Lost World - Jurassic Park
85,MartianOctocretr5,"Good dino action, but flawed by some lame scenes",6,7 October 2006,"Lost World delivers audiences what they obviously wanted from a Jurassic Park sequel: more dinosaur action and violence. It offers some new spins on the dinosaurs running amok motif, approaching the idea now from a hunter's point of view.It is very generous with the blood and gore, that's for sure. T-Rex and its mate are on the prowl again, as are a roving band of sadistic Velociraptors. Both are heard in the forest first stalking their prey, before they are seen in their night time attacks. The raptor attacks are suitably terrifying, as they ruthlessly and systematically wipe out their victims. Other new dinos come along, and one nerd falls victim to a herd of itty-bitty creatures. There's a great scene with a car hanging on the edge of disaster, and these things are all done well.But there are many flaws. First, most of the original cast have throw-away roles, or they're not here at all. Only Jeff Goldblum is featured, and he does do a good job as the lead. But now we also have his insufferably irritating daughter (who somehow stows away on a scientific expedition-an idiotic premise), and a woman he once had a relationship with (not the brat's mother), who is even stupider than the kid. She's a vet or something, and moronically operates on the broken leg of a baby T-Rex, inviting the wrath of you know who. As usual, in a Spielberg flick, the brat is an obnoxious snot, and the ex has an attitude. These two just get on your nerves.There's one scene where a T-Rex pokes his head into a tent. This utterly stupid and embarrassingly contrived encounter reminded me of a 3 Stooges episode. But other scenes are sufficiently logical enough to be scary; the cave sequence comes to mind.Then there's that lamentable scene in San Diego. The only good thing about this portion of the movie, (which is a lame rip off of King Kong to begin with), is the mysterious ship that seems to be sailing in an erratic manner at the very beginning of it. After that, you would swear the film makers are either trying to be funny or they completely lost their minds. It is just a heap of mindlessly campy slapstick nonsense, that makes the cheapest of the B-movie drive-in movies look intelligent by comparison.Apparently, they were trying to give the viewers their money's worth with plenty of screen time for the dinosaurs. In some scenes like the ending, they needed better scripting. Overall, the movie has enough good scenes to be watchable, but it's a far cry from the original.",The Lost World - Jurassic Park
86,dunmore_ego,Boring Roaring.,5,28 July 2010,"Unnecessary.That's the word that comes to mind during Steven Spielberg's THE LOST WORLD JURASSIC PARK, the insipid followup to his mighty JURASSIC PARK (1993).In a fit of George Lucas storytelling (i.e. Making It Up As He Goes Along), we are reintroduced to Hammond (Richard Attenborough), the industrialist behind Jurassic Park (whose character actually dies in the Michael Crichton book, Jurassic Park, therefore is not featured in Crichton's literary sequel, The Lost World). And Hammond lets fly with exposition piled on rationalization piled on piles of dino dropping...Been a few years since the incidents at Jurassic Park and Hammond is now a sniveling naturalist trying to preserve his OTHER island of dinosaurs from industrialists who want to cash in on it (like, uh, himself from the previous movie). Cos this other island called Site B is where the dinosaurs were really bred, see, before being transported to Jurassic Park, see; and for the sake of getting people on the island for some Running and Screaming, Hammond has sent a research team comprised of mismatched actors (Julianne Moore, Vince Vaughn and Richard Schiff). Jeff Goldblum as chaos theorist Ian Malcolm, raises the pertinent question to Hammond, as to how there are still dinosaurs running around if he bred them ""lysine deficient,"" to which Hammond looks up his Hollywood One-Liner Plot Fix Manual and replies, ""Yes, but they're flourishing - that's one of a thousand questions I want answered by the team."" Let it be known: JURASSIC PARK II was not made for its story (which departs from the book in the worst ways), nor for art, nor for fans, nor for enjoyment, purely for dirty profit. At the risk of sounding like Eric Cartman, dare we rename Spielberg's sequel JEW-RASSIC PARK? So what are you waiting for, Steven - let's see some dinosaurs!Still committed to some bare vestige of storytelling (maybe because David Koepp wrote the screenplay - sorry, 'butchered' is more appropriate), Spielberg gives us even more crammed exposition. There's Schiff's ""high hide"" (a useless piece of elevated cage that serves ABSOLUTELY NO PURPOSE); there's Vaughn's back-story about being in Greenpeace for the chicks; there's Malcolm's black daughter, Kelly (Vanessa Lee Chester), in whom we presume Malcolm's white genes decided to skip a generation (even in trying to do the right thing - by showing us an interracial child - the filmmakers cast a kid as dark as the offspring of a Namibian princess and Barack Obama Sr.).Even throwing down his best Jeff Goldblum impressions, Jeff Goldblum still can't stop this dino mound getting higher by the minute. By the time we actually reach the island, we're trying to tunnel our way out.This time, the wonder of the dinosaurs lasts even less time than in JURASSIC PARK, before they are objectified and then turned into villains. During the first fantastic stegosaur encounter (with a very fake baby stego), through everyone's gasps Malcolm actually remarks, ""Oh yeah. Oooh, ah, that's how it always starts. Then later there's running and screaming."" He actually uses my clinical definition of this fall-back position for when ideas run dry: Running and Screaming. I oughta trademark that. A million trashy ""horror"" movies will owe me a big dime.The Corporate bad guys arrive on the heels of Malcolm's research team, led by Great White Hunter Roland Tembo (Pete Postlethwaite - eternally 50) and slimy lawyer Arliss Howard. Lots of running dinosaurs. Capturing, mistreating, head-butting, ropes and jeeps and struggling corythosaurs. Oh my.Pete Postlethwaite's energetic missing scene is indicative of this film's problem: the theatrical release does not show Roland coming to the aid of a waitress at a tourist bar, knocking out a guy half his age with one hand tied behind his back. He does this not for honor, but because he's bored. It is a great insight into his character. And the scene is cut. In favor of Running and Screaming. Doesn't that tell anyone with a whit of knowledge on story construction where this film derailed? After he bags the tyrannosaur, Roland disappears from the script.Storyline so contrived, most of it is from JURASSIC PARK. Especially that ""trailer-dangling-over-the-precipice"" gag. Yawn. This overwrought sequence gives us yet another reason to dislike Mr. Spielberg, as innocuous Mr. Schiff tries valiantly to pull the dangling trailers up onto solid ground and is rewarded for his troubles by being eaten. Pulled apart by two tyrannosaurs! After all its cringe-worthy humor and ratcheting tension, the movie pays off this supposedly thrilling sequence by killing the only likable minor character. Now that was unnecessary.(The opening scene in this movie is actually the opening scene of the book, Jurassic Park, where a rich family dines on a deserted beach and the little girl stumbles on a compsognathus herd.) There is much science in Crichton's didactic book; in the movie, the most science that occurs is watching Julianne Moore try to act.THE LOST WORLD JURASSIC PARK is centered around plopping a tyrannosaur in the middle of San Diego. Spielberg's own confession. Which explains the half-baked, hurried and insubstantial dinosaur scenes on the island. More plagiarism, as the tyrannosaur arrives in Los Angeles like Dracula - aboard a ship with all the crew dead. The beast is still locked in the hold, which begs begs begs the question on how it ate everyone and managed to lock itself back in the hold.After Spielberg sates his jones on stupid t-rex gags around Diego, it is captured by Goldblum and Moore and put back on the ship. Final scene is a stinker of the highest proportions, as a conga line of herbivores walks beside a conga line of carnivores as if neither can see the other. It is unbelievably incognizant.The only reason this movie scores at all is the ""realism"" of its dinosaurs. They're the best CGI animal whores that money can buy.",The Lost World - Jurassic Park
87,pyrocitor,A classy and entertaining sequel worthy to follow the first,8,2 August 2006,"As is always the case, the fear of making a sequel to a very successful and well made movie would be that the sequel might turn out to be a pile of metaphorical... well let us say dinosaur feces, kill the franchise and ruin everyone's perception of the first film. Thankfully enough, when a director as high caliber as Steven Spielberg, who directed the first Jurassic Park film to colossal effect returns for the sequel, this is seldom the outcome. Such is the case here, as ""The Lost World"" turns out to be a wonderfully made sequel, almost as entertaining a suspense ride as the first was, four years prior. In fact, in terms of quality of work, storyline and such, The Lost World is easily on par with the original Jurassic Park (if admittably somewhat of a structural re-hash of the first). The most noticeable complaint is that the novelty of such excellent special effects and the like has worn off somewhat, since after the original Jurassic Park, audiences had grown accustomed to having their minds blown due to technological feats and creature effects. But that's not to in any way downplay the quality of the special effects on display here, which still easily equals any modern technological achievements, and in fact is even more enjoyable than most of today's dime-a-dozen CGI bloated Blockbusters. The robotic and animatronic dinosaurs actually interact with actors like real dinosaurs would, and there is never that sense of the effects looking almost real, but never QUITE real that most modern computer effects seem to provide. It's great to see Jeff Goldblum reprise his role as Ian Malcolm, the harried mathematician, and once again he manages to seem incredibly believable as the absent minded theorist trying awkwardly to interact with his daughter (newcomer Vanessa Lee Chester, who gives a terrific and very endearing performance, much better than the average child star) while remaining a strong lead all the while. Spielberg also managed to snap up a number of emerging stars in supporting performances, including Julianne Moore (spectacular and very lovable yet classy as always as Malcolm's field researcher girlfriend Sarah Harding), an early impressive performance from Vince Vaughn as wildlife photographer Nick Van Owen, character actors like the always enjoyable Pete Postlethwaite as hard edged safari hunter Roland Tembo, Peter Stormare as a sadistic enforcer who meets a righteous dirty end, and Arliss Howard as the snobby and greedy capitalist who also learns that messing with nature seldom turns out as well as predicted. Of course, it's wonderful to see Sir Richard Attenbourough also make an appearance once again as founder of the park, John Hammond, who manages to show how classy a performance one can make in only two scenes. All in all, The Lost World is quite the solid sequel, and definitely worth watching, especially for those who enjoyed the first film. From the beginning with a young British girl making acquaintance with a few unexpected prehistoric visitors on a beach to the obvious King Kong reference finish in San Francisco, Spielberg once again manages to draw us into the story, and find ourselves caring about the characters and being enthralled by the wonderful special effects and tense, exciting storyline once again. This Lost World definitely deserves to be found by those who have yet to do so. -8/10",The Lost World - Jurassic Park
88,Maciste_Brother,Could this be one of the worst movies ever?,1,4 February 2003,"I saw LOST WORLD on TV and couldn't believe what a mess this movie was. The film is like a chicken with its head cut-off, running in every direction. LOST WORLD simply doesn't know what it wants to be. I didn't care much for JURASSIC PARK (the whole concept of dinosaurs at a PARK is silly!) but at least it had a semblance of a storyline. No such thing in LOST WORLD. It's scatter-shot and at times weirdly incomprehensible.There are two things that stood out after watching this ""film.""The first thing is that Spielberg was obviously obsessed with the idea of having the CGI fx to appear as seamless as possible. It's very difficult to create special effects were the CGI dinos can be seen sharing screen time with other objects. If you watch JP, most of the CGI created dinosaurs are unobstructed by any object in the foreground. Well, not in LW. Practically every scene where there's a dinosaur, there are people or a jeep or trees or building or gas station moving in front of the CGI creatures. It's to a point where it becomes ridiculous. It creates a very monotonous and repetitious look and feel to the special effect. The effects (and dinosaurs) suddenly become bland. They fade TOO much in the background.The other technique Spielberg was obsessed with in LW was having several people talking at the same time. Almost every scene when/where there's acting, there are two or three conversations going on at the same time. It's REALLY irritating! And by doing this, by muddling the dialogue in such a way, it's obvious Spielberg was BORED with the characters, the screenplay, the ENTIRE project.Except for those two obsessive points, the direction is amazingly lackadaisical. The terrible screenplay is all over the map. There are no interesting characters. Julianne Moore is totally miscast. And her acting abilities are terrible in LW. The sets look fake. The idea of the mother dinosaur looking for her baby in San Diego is like GORGO. The in-joke of showing Asians screaming and running away from the rampaging Tyrannosaurus is unfunny.But the worst part of this terrible movie is the action. The scene when the Winnebago/laboratory hangs over the cliff is probably the MOST over-directed scene in movie history. It is stretched to point of ridiculousness. And when the little girl jumps on the pipes and does these gymnastic moves and kicks the raptor through a window, my jaw was on the floor. What were they thinking?!?! This scene is the dumbest scene since, well, GYMKATA, which is one of the best ""it's so bad it's good"" films ever made. It's funny to think that a Spielberg movie has something in common with GYMKATA. And the action scenes with Julianne Moore, watching her tumbling out of windows and falling on the ground are so unconvincing and badly directed that it's unintentionally hilarious. When they run to the helicopter, there's NO suspense or relief. We're just watching them run to the helicopter in a cheap looking movie set.But the piece de resistance is the whole rampaging through San Diego moment, which works like a Road Runner cartoon: the T-Rex is looking for her baby, which is held by Jeff and Julianne and who were on the ship when the T-Rex made its appearance after the boat crashed at the docks (another excessively directed scene). Well the angry dinosaur causes a lot of death & destruction as it follows the two all over San Diego, who, eventually, end up going back to the ship anyway. What was the point of this whole moment? Just the novelty of having a dinosaur running around a big city?THE LOST WORLD is REALLY bad.",The Lost World - Jurassic Park
89,RNMorton,Unbelievably bad,2,12 October 1999,"It is astounding that, in this day and age, the sequel to one of the biggest blockbusters of film history could be this bad.  What were they thinking?  Who looked at this script before they began filming?  Absurd rehash of Jurassic Park, more implausible in every possible way.",The Lost World - Jurassic Park
90,TheUnknown837-1,"a worthy sequel with excellent visuals, but a somewhat underdeveloped storyline",7,3 November 2007,"The first film, ""Jurassic Park"" was an enormous commercial, and fairly good critical success worldwide. And it is of no surprise to cinema-goers such as myself that a sequel would be released sooner or later, whether or not original novel author Michael Crichton wrote it in paper form first. I myself have read Crichton's novel, upon which this film was based. And I have, of course, seen the film numerous times. When I was young, this was my favorite out all three films because it had the most dinosaurs and elaborate sequences in it. Now I consider it second-best. And I do have to criticize it for a few flaws, which unfortunately, for it, are very important in a good film. However, ""The Lost World: Jurassic Park"" does pull itself off as a fairly good film for what it was meant to be: an elaborate and heart-pounding action thriller. And it does just that.The dinosaurs in the film are just as good, if not better, than the animals from the first film. They couldn't look any more realistic. They move fluid-like, behave like real animals, react like them, and although we have no idea what a real dinosaur behaved, the creatures on the film react just the way we want them to. They're dangerous, unpredictable creatures with a taste for human flesh. The combination of computer graphics and animatronics were perfect. Nobody can complain about the visuals. What they can, and what I can complain about, is the characterization.That is the major weakness of the film. While the dinosaurs are colorful and creative, our cast of characters and development of the plot is not so high and wonderful. It is in fact a good thing that we cut quickly through the first part of the movie to get right to the island so that the dinosaurs could start to appear and cause panic, as they were intended to do so. Because the way they story starts out, and introduces our characters, it's in need of major improvement. Many characters exist just to exist. They have no real traits or characteristics to make them instantly recognizable or even worthy of remembrance by the audience. Characters come and go, some survive the encounters with dinosaurs on the island, but are never seen again after they return to civilization. Even when they are of some great importance, or intended importance, during the first two-thirds of the film.However, ""The Lost World: Jurassic Park"" succeeds entirely with its action sequences, which couldn't be better. And that's what really works out in a film like this. We want to be thrilled. And the film does exactly that. Once the action started to get going, I didn't even think about critiquing the film until it was over. Steven Spielberg has a natural talent for visualizing complex and heart-pounding thrills that we see in this film, and the first ""Jurassic Park"". The Velociraptor sequence in ""The Lost World: Jurassic Park"" is a particular favorite of mine. The only thing it was lacking was the realization of the intelligence of the raptors, as was demonstrated in the first film, and third one. The Tyrannosaurs, however, are the main dinosaurs and get the most screen time and have the most impact, especially when we come to a climax which almost seemed natural and is most definitely traditional. Really, the dinosaurs are the cast of the film. And that's okay.The summarize it all up, ""The Lost World: Jurassic Park"" is not a perfect film. It could have very much dealt with a few revisions to the screenplay to make our characters and storyline more in-depth and colorful. It would have made our amazing action sequences even more powerful and thrilling and thus, an even better film. But the way it is, it's a worthy sequel. Another fine film by Steven Spielberg.",The Lost World - Jurassic Park
91,gizmomogwai,I liked it,7,10 February 2008,"I saw the Jurassic Park movie before reading the novel and read The Lost World novel before seeing the movie. I preferred the Jurassic Park novel to the movie because it was more complex- more characters, more dinosaurs (particularly, diverse dinosaurs), more challenges, more story. I know few people would agree, but I actually prefer The Lost World movie to the novel for the same reasons I prefer the Jurassic Park novel to the movie. The film version of The Lost World is more elaborate. There are more characters, there are more dinosaurs- not just raptors and rexes which were emphasized in the novel, but the compys played a big role, and we got to see the triceratops attacking rather than being sick as in the first one, and we got to see stegosaurs for the first time, and a pterosaur for the first time. The movie adds the twist of setting the rex loose in San Diego. This is the first time, and so far the only time in the Jurassic Park movies where we got to see the battle between man and dinosaur in an urban setting. I liked it. Just like I like how King Kong moves to the city. One guy even got stepped on, which was definitely something different!The Lost World movie has its flaws, though. One of them is Vanessa Lee Chester. Who asks their parents to be stricter? And are we really supposed to believe she can kick a raptor out the window- even after yelling at it and losing the element of surprise? And there's not much characterization. But the special effects are improved in this one and I believe they're the best in the trilogy. There's plenty of action and humour. It's altogether a good effort for its genre.",The Lost World - Jurassic Park

93,vip_ebriega,This is where the American GODZILLA is put to shame.,8,24 May 2007,"My Take: A riveting, thrill-a-minute adventure sequel from the one and only Steven Spielberg. This has been a childhood favorite of mine, second only to the original, and this will be a great film to me. It comes to a little surprise to me, many hated it. Sure it's not pressed firmly or so to the sequel novel by Michael Chrichton, who also wrote the first, or maybe because of the last half hour of the film (Steven Spielberg's tribute to either ""Godzilla"" or ""King Kong"" perhaps). But surely, is it really that bad? Not really, once you come to think of it as pure adventure movie. Avoid all pretenses of reality, and get aught up in its thrills and non-stop adventure. THE LOST WORLD may not be high on realism, put in pure thrills, it's pure Dino-mite. It's still pretty obvious why many people hated this movie. Obviously, it's a sequel for sequel's sake. You know this movie should be made, and eventually it will, and it's bound to be bigger and better. And bigger it was indeed, with such a feeling of deja vu to some. Indeed, the movie has its similarities to the first movie. But still, despite its clichés, it's nice to have the same feeling of thrills and adventure the second time around. This movie does produce some thrills, excitement and suspense, so why can't it be enjoyed simply for that? The film not only reminded me about the first JURASSIC PARK, but such other similar movies like ALIENS and maybe a dash of KING KONG as well. THE LOST WORLD won't find a place next to SCHINDLER'S LIST or SAVING PRIVATE RYAN, but maybe it will manage to slip a seat right next to RAIDERS OF THE LOST ARK and the other INDIANA JONES movies, as well as the first JURASSIC PARK, clearly demonstrating this still exhibits one of the director's impressive talents in building thrills: Keeping our palms sweaty as we slowly keep ourselves falling from the edge of our seats. THE LOST WORLD, with undeniably killer suspense, is Spielberg at his cat-and-mouse thriller best since... well the first JURASSIC PARK. Rating: **** out of 5.",The Lost World - Jurassic Park
94,SanteeFats,Very good,8,7 July 2013,"Not quite as good as the first one only because several of the first movie cast was not in it. Sam Neill, Laura Dern are two that come to mind. This is still an excellent movie. Jeff Golblum is back as Doctor Ian Malcolm and does his usual good job. His character is still insightful and more importantly he still gets some humorous lines as well. Julianne Moore plays a very tunnel vision doctor that is more interested in the animals than in her own survival, at least at times. One of the not so good guys that are also on this island if the hunter played by Pete Postlethwaite. He is there for the protection but his personal objective is to bag a big one. Well it turns out he gets bagged.",The Lost World - Jurassic Park
95,Stampsfightclub,Overblown action orientated sequel,2,31 January 2010,"Ian Malcolm (Goldblum) ventures to a dinosaur inhabited island to rescue his girlfriend only for him and his crew to be caught by money minded gang of opportunists.When Jurassic Park was released in 1993 it showcased a whole new meaning to the Blockbuster term, encoding extinct animals and generating a spellbinding adventure that no one could predict and everyone would enjoy and directed by the man who brought us Jaws and Indiana Jones, what more could we ask for? As money is everything these days, asking more inevitably left a heartbreaking backlash.Selling out and endorsing the Jurassic Park into a franchise ultimately left us with a trilogy that the two sequels never replicated the original and we are left with conventional action and little personal to say. This, a film I thoroughly enjoyed when viewing it in the cinema when first released has lost its way over the years to me as what was once a scary adventure has now appeared as formulaic action with no cutting edge.This is evident in the first sequence where the story opens on a beautiful beach and a young girl is attacked by an apparently harmless dinosaur, and there ensues our adventure where a fleetingly Richard Attenborough emotionally blackmails Jeff Goldblum into going to the island to inspect the dinosaur's current living habits, only to discover his girlfriend is there. And the moment when we hear the dramatic music after Jeff's storm out signals the demise of the film. The use of the strings here is terrible. How can you use such a strong song as a voyage to the island in the first film and use it as a impersonal defiant stance in the second? Things go from bad to worse when we learn Jeff's character has a big backdrop of personal baggage. A kid, a bad relationship agenda, the inability to make tough decisions etc. The reason we loved Malcolm in the first film because he was a mystery, a suave back character to insert spurts of comedy. Here the character is just a joke, too impersonal with nothing unique, a bog standard unlikely hero determined to resolve a personal problem whilst looking to save the day.Perhaps the most notable defect of this picture is the dinosaurs. The reason they worked so well in the 1993 release is because they were kept quiet, out of the way and inserted as a surprise, the build up was certainly powerful. Here we see them a few minutes in attacking the young girl, an anonymous young girl with no personal attachment to the island unlike Sam Neill's protagonist. Then before Jeff and mates can get off the boat there they are and we see nothing but dinosaurs from there till finish. Even the T-rex action sequences feel old and unsurprising, especially one of the most unrealistic cliff hangers you will ever see. The inclusion of dinosaurs in the real world adds a little excitement, but ultimately a ridiculous last gasp saviour that never justifies its purpose.Here we have a failed fantasy adventure that is a true shame considering the power and surprise of the previous hit.",The Lost World - Jurassic Park
96,stamper,Worst Spielbergian Cinema offering of the 90's,5,17 September 2001,"I've seen a lot of films in my time, but never have I seen a master of cinema (like Lucas, Cameron, Zemeckis) make such a bad film after he was established as a director. I mean this is (looking at it from a Spielbergian perspective) a piece of CRAP!!! I mean, if you're a 2rd rate director this would have been a pretty good effort, but as far as a genius like Spielberg goes, this is no work of art at all. It lacks everything that was the greatness of Jurassic Park:1. A great soundtrack (where are those epic, emotional tunes Mr.Williams)2. A good story (Mr.Crichton, don't let anybody ever tell you again to write a sequel if you don't have a good story in mind)3. Good actors (no offense to Mrs.Lewis, but she can do better, as well as (pretty much) the rest of the cast members)4. Great direction (sorry Mr.Spielberg, you failed here)5. The feeling of an adventure movie (I don't know what this was supposed to be, but it doesn't occur to me as an adventure movie. Sometimes I had the feeling Spielberg was making a parody of his own masterpiece Jurassic Park. B-grade Godzilla-esque acting, disaster'  scenes and stupid jokes that fell flat.6. A good length (this one is way too long)Wrapping it up, I must say that it is a shame this one even got to tag along the name Jurassic Park after it's Title (The Lost World) and I'd rather had Jurassic Park 3 made directly after the original. But luckily The Lost World and Jurassic Park 3 are not stringed together. (Technically you could have even named JP3, Jurassic Park 2, for this one is called The Lost World: Jurassic Park. WHY OH WHY did nobody think of THAT???)

97,ivo-cobra8,Defending an Underrated Sequel The Lost World: Jurassic Park,9,8 August 2015,"I still don't get the hate for The Lost World: Jurassic Park and the love for Jurassic Park III? Can Someone explain to me why is III in your opinion so much better than The Lost World: Jurassic Park is? In my opinion III lacks on the story and is not terrible because Steven Spielberg did not Direct the movie but it is terrible because the whole movie makes no damn sense it is too short, it lacks on the story and is really awful to me. It has no character development in III at all and lying to Dr. Grant and trick him on that island is just inhuman and awful. And Why is Jurassic World so much better than The Lost World: Jurassic Park? I am sorry is not better than the second movie. In my opinion is not, but is at least better than Jurassic Lark III is but is not any better over The Lost World: Jurassic Park (1997).An Underrated classic sequel in the series and the last movie directed by Steven Spielberg. I have enjoyed this movie much better than Jurassic Park III and Jurassic World. The movie is very bashed and criticized by their fans of the first film. Just like Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom this is the sequel that is very bashed from critics and fans again. This is the first and unfortunately last great sequel to the original Jurassic Park. I think Jeff Goldblum and Julianne Moore did a good job on there performances. The Lost World: Jurassic Park is like Godzilla T-Rex in San Diego. I still love This movie a very underrated science fiction/action sequel film in The Jurassic Park entry franchise. I think for it's sequel it had a good start running. The Lost World: Jurassic Park is loosely based on Michael Crichton's 1995 novel The Lost World.The film won 1 award for Best Effects and Visual Effects. Things I don't like: The film has a few problems that are really unnecessary and I really hate it:The daughter of Ian is black in here,which makes to me no sense since Ian is white. Vince Vaughn was unnecessary to cast him and unneeded. I seriously hate Vince Vaughn,this is a science fiction/Action film not a comedy Vince get this in your head! Vince stole Roland Tembo bullets for his shot gun and with that action Vince jeopardized and put whole people in the camp in the mortal danger and T-Rex come after them and eat bunch of people cause of him. Roland could shot the T-Rex and save people and because of Vince's action he couldn't. I seriously hate Vince Vaughn for this. I am glad he was cut by the end of the film.Peter Stormare/Compys sequences from swarm of Compsognathus knock him and killing him were really unnecessary and unneeded etc.), plus it has a sluggish pace and such.Baby T-Rex in this movie was extremely annoying and his yelling in the trailer and in the car it annoyed me so much and on end of the movie.Thing's I love in this movie: T-Rex dinosaur in a city San Diego, the chase and eating people in the city are awesome. Ian and Sarah drive to the amphitheater harbor and pick up the infant. They make sure they bait the creature with its infant and drive back to the docks and place the infant in the cargo hold of the ship.Sarah prepares a sedative dart and shoots the T. Rex as Malcolm closes the cargo hold door, trapping the animals inside. Awesome! Surviving hunters travel through an open field of tall grass. Ajay tries to warn them, shouting ""DON'T GO INTO THE LONG GRASS!"" but none of them listens and are killed one by one by Velociraptors.Pete Postlethwaite as Roland Tembo as famous animal hunter was awesome, I seriously I love the actor and his character, He came to Isla Sorna along with his hunting partner, Ajay Sidhu, in hopes of gaining the ultimate trophy and not for the money a male T. Rex.He survived in this movie. A shame a good actor Pete Postlethwaite died 4.years ago and he is not with us anymore. Jeff Goldblum as Dr. Ian Malcolm from Jurassic Park (1993) and Julianne Moore as Dr. Sarah Harding did a good job on there performances.Returning of John Hammond his nephews Tim and Lex the same actors from Jurassic park (1993). Tim and Lex had a brief cameo but John did had a cameo on the end of the movie. Daughter Kelly to do some a gymnastics and kick a little raptor trough the window was really a bad ass awesome.Cgi and the film effects wasn't that bad either they were really good. John Williams did return as music composer and he did return with his theme music score. Like its predecessor, The Lost World: Jurassic Park was scored by famed composer John Williams (a longtime collaborator with director Steven Spielberg).John Williams didn't write a stereotypical sequel score, but instead developed a wildly different style for the different location, cast, and darker tone of the second Jurassic Park film.The Lost World: Jurassic Park is a 1997 American science fiction adventure film. It is the second installment in the Jurassic Park film series. A sequel to 1993's Jurassic Park.I love Jurassic Park (1993) as everyone do but I also love The Lost World: Jurassic Park.

98,petra_ste,Deserves extinction,4,30 July 2007,"Spielberg's worst movie until Kingdom of the Crystal Skull, this sequel of the 1993 classic bears little resemblance to Crichton's novel - although, to be frank, The Lost World wasn't a very good book either.Scientists Malcolm (Goldblum) and Sarah (Julianne Moore) explore Isla Sorna, populated by dinosaurs created by Ingen, meeting the mercenaries led by greedy Ludlow (Arliss Howard). Good guys and bad guys team up to escape when T-Rex and Raptors start eating everybody. The less said about the ignoble Godzilla-like epilogue in San Diego, the better.Goldblum reprises the character of Malcolm but without the dry wit of the first film. It's typical of sequels: a funny character gets promoted to protagonist and suddenly he isn't funny anymore, because now he has to drive the plot and endure the obligatory arc (think Jack Sparrow in last Pirates movies).I've always been a fan of beautiful, talented redhead Julianne Moore, but here she is wooden and miscast, her worst performance that I recall. Postlethwaite's hunter is the best character but disappears before the last act, which is dramatically unsatisfying. Now, if the last act had disappeared altogether, *that* would have been a satisfaction.Character development is a failure. In Jurassic Park even secondary figures like Muldoon , Arnold and Gennaro had some effective bits of characterization. Here, a bunch of nobodies run around screaming like in some abysmal straight-to-video horror flick. Were we supposed to care about the bearded paleontologist? About Tembo's hunting pal? Sorry, who were they? I must have missed the scenes which actually gave them a personality.Another issue are the dinosaurs themselves. In the first film they were awe-inspiring; here they have become just more CGI beasties, and occasionally even look fake (see the Compys attacking Stormare).The score is also a disappointment. Williams' work for Jurassic Park was magic. Here, every time you expect the beautiful familiar theme to rise, it falters and stutters - a good metaphor for the movie as a whole.Spielberg being who he is, there are a few neat visuals and set-pieces (the trailer hanging from the cliff, the Raptors in the high grass), but not enough to redeem this misbegotten sequel.4,5/10",The Lost World - Jurassic Park
99,The_Movie_Cat,"""Thank God for site B.""",6,15 May 2001,"WARNING: REVIEW CONTAINS SPOILERS
Thank God indeed, for Lost World is vastly superior to the original and I'm amazed it hasn't been appraised as such. Maybe it's due to the lack of spectacle and novelty, which was, conversely, the only notable thing about the first. Though if it's Dinos you want there are more here (though admittedly shot with less cinematic scope, and, considering this film was made four years later, the CGI looks considerably less impressive). Yet while not giving the dinosaurs their full majesty, the direction is superior in every other respect. That's another problem, or plus, with the film. It deals far less with the blockbuster impact of T-Rexes, but with the actual motivation of the characters.Another success is that only the interesting characters are retained, with Gold, um, Goldblum as nervously engaging as ever, and Attenborough as a cameo, this time completely forgetting whether he's supposed to be English or Scots. Plans for the third film - bringing back blandies Sam Neill and Laura Dern - do not bode well, however. One of my favourite moments in a more thoughtfully shot film is Goldblum's introduction. After watching a cod English family playing on a desert island, the family screams - to cut to Goldblum's mouth wide open on a desert plain. The camera pulls back to show him yawning, and the desert a billboard poster in a subway. It's a clever touch, and there are more. Jeff's ability to prick the whole absurdity of the whole premise is met with his self-referential: ""Ya boo!, that's how it all starts. But later there's running, and, um, screaming.""Okay, there's still the occasional awkward exposition, though this is Goldblum handling things, so it gets by. There's also the in-built character/plot device, as with Jeff telling his daughter Kelly: ""You've got a gymnastics competition, you've been training for that for months."" - cue Kelly backflipping and somersaulting dinos. However, this is forgivable, as 1. The entire film doesn't hinge on this contrivance; and 2. It's more natural, and Kelly has a much better developed character than annoying brat Lex from the first movie. Lex only existed to hack computers; Kelly has far more functions to a wider plot.In fact, everything is done better here: the (far less cheesy) explorers are joined by a group of game hunters, which adds a vital conflict, absent in the first. It's also an isolated island with no immediate help or defence capabilities. Finally, as this is an established sequel there's no need for clumsy set-up. Some perverse humour, such as a man stuck to the T-Rex's foot, is also a nice touch. This is overall a much darker film, both in brightness and tone, appealing to more adult audience. Some of the violent content could be unsuitable for younger viewers, and there's at least one genuinely scary moment, too.Perhaps the acting also has a lot towards making this the better movie. Because Pete Postlethwaite gets as much to do here as Goldblum did in the original (i.e. nothing) and has to utter absurd lines like ""I believe I've spent enough time in the company of death."" Yet, like so many others, he's a much better actor than the denizens of the 94 version, so it goes largely unnoticed. Okay, there are plot holes, most famously the ""how did the T-Rex escape on the boat?"" Yet others abound, such as how did Kelly and Sarah get out of the tent when it was wrapped around a Dino's head? It matters little; the film is packaged with surprising courtesy, particularly in regard to the original's popcorn-fodder status.Lots of the setpieces are more inventive this time, too, with a truly spectacular ""falling on breaking glass"" sequence. Its loose adherence to the three-act structure can tire slightly, as the film meanders on without any clear purpose at times. The ending, perhaps the weakest element, could have done what the original didn't: take the danger into a human environment. This does, in fact, happen, and, by the film's own rules (central characters never die) could have seen a few exciting moments of dino carnage. But the reason why it doesn't really count is that Spielberg-itis takes over and this element is pared down into comic setpieces, before the 'Rex is conveniently reshipped to the island. What should have been a wholly satisfying conclusion is neutered somewhat, leaving us with a Jurassic Park film which is well honed, yet ultimately feels hollow. 6/10.",The Lost World - Jurassic Park
100,fernandoschiavi,"Even managing to create punctual and memorable moments of action that are undeniably fun, this is not a film with the same magic or heart as its predecessor",7,13 June 2020,"This second part of the franchise has ups and downs. The first big mistake in the sequence is its totally confused synopsis. It is very clear how much the script tries to justify the sequence. How do you continue a story about a tourist amusement park located on an island where humans revived dinosaurs and ended up loosening and killing a lot of people? Now, you create another island ""completely"" different where dinosaurs lived by humans also live and where many people will die. Simple. While Crichton's book even took the story of Hammond's dinosaurs and Ian Malcolm's unusual return (read the books to see how unusual) through a deeper, darker and more intriguing path, Spielberg's film seems to follow little of that only in tone, not in essence.All the initial explanation by tycoon John Hammond and the justifications presented sound a little forced, but it is still possible to buy the idea of a second island, Sorna Island, also known as ""Site B"", where dinosaurs were created before being sent to Ilha Nublar - island of the original film - to be exposed to the public. It is here that the plot develops with the conflict between members of the expedition sent by Hammond's nephew with the intention of capturing dinosaur specimens to be exhibited at the new Jurassic Park headquarters in the city of San Diego and the team sent by the magnate himself , who, knowing the nephew's intentions, intends to register the animals in their natural habitat, with the intention of presenting their creation to the world and making the place a sanctuary forbidden for all, thus preserving the species that live there.Spielberg ends up deconstructing the wonderful adventure made in the previous film to build a film with a much darker theme, focused on a flawed script and characters without charisma. The choice to make a darker film is one of the worst ideas implemented. If what made the first one unique was his good humor, here he is totally lost trying to convey an idea of greater danger. And, unfortunately for the script, it is very difficult to buy that, partly because throughout the film no character - with the exception of Malcolm - seems to really convey the danger he is facing. As the mathematician had witnessed the terror caused by the dinosaurs before, he knew well what he would find on the island, justifying his initial reluctance to return to the place. This only gets worse when several other characters join the film. If the script had focused only on Malcolm's small group, until the narrative would have a chance to work, but when both groups of archaeologists and hunters come together at some point in the film, every little bit of character development is discarded and everyone gets together. they make only dead weight to be killed and eaten by the dinosaurs.
This sequel seeks to completely differentiate itself from its predecessor and tries to expand its universe and the themes of the original film in new ways. If the first film dealt with men playing gods, its continuation explores a more direct and conventional route with men arrogantly interfering in the nature that does not belong to them and which promises to fight back brutally. The choice of darker tones and poorly lit places reveals an evolution in the narrative proposed by the director. There was no more room for the idyllic fantasy of Parque dos Dinossauros, on the contrary, what survived was the spirit of hunting and hunter, with man being the main target of hunger. The problem is that none of this is properly explored in the film, not even between the lines. Leaving aside possible interesting questions to make room for new uninteresting characters and sequences of action and suspense that try to match that of the previous film.The film tries to assemble a team following the model of the first, with reduced teams in different locations, only now with Malcolm as ""leader"". Such an approach does not work, even with the efforts of Jeff Goldblum. His skepticism and sarcasm remain here, but the actor still tries to balance the attitude of a responsible hero, a concerned boyfriend, the verbalized exhibitor of all the dangers that the Dinosaurs are about to do, and a careful father. Dad? As a father, the script still comes to invent a daughter for Malcolm out of the blue (but didn't he say he had three children in the first film?). After all, the girl played by Vanessa Lee Chester, is totally disposable for the plot. Here we have Malcolm's girlfriend, played by Julianne Moore, initially well presented, but soon lost completely; and a very poorly developed photographer played by Vince Vaughn. All this weakness is consolidated in the middle of the film, where many other figures appear without being deepened, as well as a concern to show an excess of dinosaurs, causing the protagonist team to lose its strength. To satisfy fans of the original, in addition to the slightly more important participation of Richard Attenborough, we have Joseph Mazzello and the almost adult and beautiful Ariana Richards, returning as Tim and Lex, speaking just over a sentence.If today there is a fear that sequels of highly successful films fall into certain ""trends"" that make it an inferior film and fall short of its original, ""Jurassic Park: The Lost World"" has become one of the great examples of these sad ones Tendencies. Of course, it is not fair to classify it as a complete disaster. There are several Spielberg brands that make the film excellent entertainment. The darker climate is the main feature here. Besides suspense, fear have never been more present. Janusz Kaminski's great photograph is darker and more frightening with scenes predominantly nocturnal and rainy as in the original film, combined with art direction, soundtrack by master John Williams and impeccable sound complement the creation of the suspense.Interestingly, we can easily see here the influence of the classic King Kong in several references. One of the ships docked at the San Diego docks was called ""The Venture"", the same one that brought the giant gorilla to America. Another point is that after a great adventure in the creature's habitat, it is captured and taken to America to be exploited commercially by man, and just like King Kong, arrives by ship. During the film we noticed a scene in which Ian Malcolm's daughter stays with Eddie Carr in a structure suspended at the top, with the scene becoming very similar to the scene of the island tribe's sacrifice for King Kong. And of course, the scene in which the ""beast"" breaks free and goes out into the city streets causing panic could not be missing. Still in the port, we noticed the dinosaur making a great noise with the view of the buildings in front of it, looking like the scene of Kong on top of the building at the end of the film, giving the perfect contrast of today with a being who lived 65 million years ago. While on the run, the T-Rex leaves causing destruction and panic in the streets, just as when Kong manages to get rid of the chains that bound him. The difference is that the animal was not killed, only recaptured and sent back to the Island. The similarities in several scenes with the classic of the 1930s are evident and used with competence in the formula of this script, again well adapted by David Koepp, one of the most active collaborators currently with Spielberg.
The story condenses in a little more than two hours a good story and that we did not even notice to pass of so well that it flowed. It is also important to mention here the great scenes of this production such as the scenes of chase in the middle of the island's forest, as well as the scene of the fall of the trailer on the cliff, the attack of velociraptors in the communication center, the invasion of the uncontrolled boat in the Ingens, and the entire final sequence of the T-Rex arriving in the uncontrolled boat already without crew at the port of San Diego and all the uproar caused by the city streets, highlighting the scene of the boy and his parents noticing the Jurassic giant in their garden or when the T-Rex attacks a bus.At the climax of the film, which seems to end at a point with the group finally managing to escape the island, we see a kind of Godzilla short film that mixes with King Kong, where we see T-Rex imposing chaos and death in Los Angeles. One third of the film that seems completely added at the last minute to create a giant monster movie ending. A really necessary sequence? No, but it's undeniably fun to watch it unfold. Not only does the T-Rex interact with the modern world in a very believable and palpable way, drinking water from the pool, eating a traffic light and civilians, fighting a bus, all being very well conducted in action and the impressive effects of realists. With Spielberg still taking the opportunity to pay homage to the classic monster film, coincidentally or not, of the same name, The Lost World / The Lost World of 1925 where dinosaurs roamed the human metropolis, installing chaos.""Jurassic Park: The Lost World"" is a continuation that nobody asked to exist, but that came to life thanks to the love of its director for this universe of creatures and monsters born of human biology, and for the mountains of money that he raised. Even managing to create punctual and memorable moments of action that are undeniably fun, and the feeling of enchantment of being able to glimpse so many dinosaurs on the scene is still present, albeit little, this is not a film with the same magic or heart as its predecessor.",The Lost World - Jurassic Park

In fact, there at yet ANOTHER island, fighting the same dinosaurs (some not-so-memorable new ones). And John Williams music, unlike the classic score to the first one, just doesn't have that sense of wonder here. Not only that, the story is quite tame and the acting suffers from flat characters (it's sad because great actors like Jeff Goldblum are subjected to so-so dialogue and events).

104,Atreyu_II,"Quite bad, frankly",4,12 March 2011,"First off, why isn't movie called 'Jurassic Park 2' or 'Jurassic Park: The Lost World' instead of 'The Lost World: Jurassic Park'? Why invert the positions? The result is a strange title...Well, this is quite a crummy follow-up to the great original film. I cannot give it much praise. I didn't like it, it was simply not in the same league of the original. I thought its action was often over the top and the story left much to be desired. The cinematography was crude most of the time, even though it still had some nice cinematography but not on the same level as the original. Also, I felt that Alan Grant was greatly missed on this one. The idea of Ian Malcolm having a much bigger role in this one was very bad. Also, Ian Malcolm was more bitter in this film (he is funnier in this original). Malcolm's girlfriend wasn't very appealing to me either. I prefer Dr. Ellie Sattler from the original. And how come Malcolm has a fully black daughter? Being Malcolm a white man, that doesn't make sense, unless she was adopted. That is one of the many unanswered questions in this motion-picture. I disliked many of the characters. There were too many characters and too many annoying ones. Another thing that disappointed me is that Tim and Lex only have a very minor role and then they just disappear like that. They only appear about 20 seconds. I would have liked them to have a bigger role, even if not as big as they have in the original.Speaking of Tim and Lex, they run to Malcolm and give him a big hug. He doesn't really spend time with them in the original, so it would make more sense if Alan Grant was in this movie and he was the one the kids ran to and hugged. After all, he was the one who spent time with them in the original and rescued them.The people who went to the new dinosaur island seemed more stupid. They seemed to just want to challenge the dinosaurs. At least in the original it was something that went awfully wrong. But here they already knew about the events 4 years before. The little dinosaurs bugged me: they were too many and too dull and served no purpose at all.The lines were nothing special, but I did like Malcolm's line «Mommy is very angry». That was the best line.This is far more violent and gory than the original. The scene when a T-Rex throws a hinged trailer over a cliff is extremely tense. It's an attempt to repeat the formula of the original's famous scene of the jeep being attacked.At least in one thing this sequel is comparable to the original: the amazingness of the dinosaurs (how great and real they look and their awesome roars and impeccable animation).",The Lost World - Jurassic Park

I think that if you liked the original 'Jurassic Park' film, this film is basically the same with subtle differences. This type of story isn't for everyone, though.

But most got very dissapointed, because the mystique, brilliance, dialogs and excitemeny is all gone sadly! Although it's still brilliant entertaining and nice made it doesn't stand on own feet.Sam Neill and Laura Dern is gone, so we've got some totally new characters into the picture although Malcolm and Hammond is still there. The story is a bit dumb, getting to know that Hammond had made two islands with dinosaurs on both. One ready to be Jurassic Park and the other were the creatures could live in freedom without fences etc. So Hammond decides to send a small unit down to the island to do some research on the dinosaurs...something that off course they never should have done! The first was stunning; really stunning! This is just entertaining, not more, something I think is very sad! LOST WORLD has got it's sequences that's truly fabulous but threw the pity dialogs, the all-threw mood and the terrible thing that T-Rex reaches the city! The respect is gone and the thrills are now based on the creatures actually attacking, not the mystique how they look like, cause after all; we've seen them!

At the time it was surrounded by negative and mixed reviews. In hindsight, Spielberg was obviously attempting something much different and on this repeat viewing, I found myself enjoying the film. The Lost World is a much darker film, like Temple of Doom. It's not a direct sequel and it attempts to evolve the series from the usual park overrun by animals. The action is dialled up to 11 and it's a vast change in direction, a good one. I feel this film deserves more recognition, as it's not the usual studio sequel. Spielberg attempted something different and it works in my opinion. It's not a tired retread, Jurassic World did that to a very meh reaction.

113,virek213,More terror and suspense with the dinosaurs,9,30 July 2001,"I couldn't disagree more with those who say THE LOST WORLD is an awful movie.  I have seen it many times in the cinema and on video; and for my money, this is a fine continuation of the JURASSIC PARK story.  This time, it is revealed by ambitious billionaire John Hammond (Richard Attenborough) that the genetically engineered dinosaurs on Isla Nublar were actually bred on Isla Sorna, situated 87 miles from Nublar.  Thus far, the Isla Sorna dinosaurs have remained in isolation.  But the Isla Nublar disaster has resulted in Attenborough losing control of his InGen corporation to his unscrupulous nephew (Arliss Howard), who wants to bring the dinosaurs back to the as-yet-unfinished Jurassic Park complex in San Diego.The only people standing in his way are chaos theorist Ian Malcolm (Jeff Goldblum), Goldblum's daughter (Vanessa Lee Chester), his girlfriend (Julianne Moore), and two other men (Richard Schiff, Vince Vaughan).  More terror and suspense ensue as both Goldblum's and Howard's teams come face-to-face with the island's dinosaur populace.  And while Goldblum only loses Schiff from his team and manages to get the rest off the island, Howard still manages to get one T-rex and her infant back to San Diego.  The mayhem continues there.I give this film a 9 rather than the 10 I gave to the original, because not all of the special effects work is exactly as great as before.  But I think those who condemn Spielberg's sequel out of hand are sadly mistaken.  This has enough Hitchcock-style black humor to satisfy; and the sequence of Goldblum and his team trapped in a trailer being overturned and pushed over the cliff by the T-rex is one of the most hair-raising sequences I have ever seen on screen.",The Lost World - Jurassic Park
114,gigan-92,Here Come the Money Shots!!,8,30 September 2010,"Here comes the sequel to an epic. Steven Spielberg is back and what we get is a mixed bag. I saw it as a kid and naturally loved it. But as we grow older, so do our knowledge and need for probing. Some cast members did not return and weren't even referenced to at all in the story but other aspects in this film make up for it. Jeff Goldblum does reprise his role and I'm quite happy about that. Julian Moore and Vince Vaughn star here, but to me the actor who really caught my eye was Pete Postlethwaite, as Roland. In terms of story this film was definitely built as a thriller. A lot of the story is non-sensible, as I'm sure you've read. The boat somehow guiding itself back to the exact spot where it was destined via no pilot (or maybe auto-pilot), an experienced mercenary on an island full of flesh-eating dinosaurs wandering off just to take a leak, with Juan listening to his MP3 trying to catch a baby dinosaur when I'm sure you heard its enraged father is right behind himeh, the list goes on give or take. Basically this purely a money-shot type of film. We do see a bit of a deeper side to Goldblum's character and that does add a bit of zest to it all. A lot of the other characters are mildly gone into, just barely enough to get a sense of who they are. But suckers like me to this day end up caring for them. Ha-ha Decent characterization at best.Once again a riveting score by John Willams, but in all fairness we get no real time to appreciate it. The SFX of course good as can possibly be, but we established that in the first movie. In America what movie doesn't have good SFX? That's why I don't care when people say Godzilla films SFX are terrible. Because I LOVE dinosaurs I give it a 7.9, around a near B-, but no doubt still a keeper by far.

115,moviesleuth2,Excellent sequel,8,6 March 2010,"Like with all sequels, it is impossible to compare ""The Lost World"" to its predecessor. Yes, it goes without saying that ""Jurassic Park"" is the better of the two films. The first is a classic in its truest form, and this sequel has fallen from the tree, but not as far as many die-hard fans of the first might say.After the events of the first film, InGen is being subjected to billions of dollars in lawsuits and damages, and the survivors are left looking like idiots when the company won't back up their claims of what happened at the park. John Hammond is ousted by his nephew, Peter Ludlow (Arliss Howard), who is about to make a bigger mistake than his uncle did: bring the dinos to a zoo he built in San Diego. Hammond sent an expedition to study the dinos in their ""natural"" habitat, including Nick (Vince Vaughn), Eddie (Richard Schiff), and Sara (Julianne Moore). He also gets Dr. Malcom (Jeff Goldblum), but he only goes to drag Sara, who is his girlfriend, and the others out of there before they become hors d'oeuvres for some very nasty dinosaurs.The best thing about ""The Lost World"" is that it's not a clone of the first film. ""National Treasure: Book of Secrets"" showed us how badly a sequel can tank when it follows its predecessor too closely. Although there are many definite similarities (and not just the obvious ones, like characters and dinosaurs), ""The Lost World"" is an altogether different film.The film generates plenty of tension and scares, but there are a few things that don't work. For one thing, Spielberg humanizes the dinosaurs too much. Monsters are more frightening when we see them as just that, not human beings who look like monsters. ""Jurassic Park"" did that, but ""The Lost World"" explains too much about the dinosaurs' (specifically the T-Rex) nature. Although this sets up the climax of the film, that one doesn't really work either.The acting is solid. Jeff Goldblum is his same sarcastic, cynical self. He's the voice of reason, but as filtered through Dr. Malcolm, it becomes original instead of a cliché. Julianne Moore wasn't widely recognized at the time of filming as the versatile actress that we now know she is, but once again, she demonstrates her versatility. Moore is just as home in an action movie as she is in a character drama. Arliss Howard is perfectly vile as the arrogant, hubristic Ludlow. Whereas Hammond was simply misguided, Ludlow is cold and sociopathic; he makes Scrooge McDuck look like Mother Theresa. Pete Poslethwaite is delicious as the Big Game hunter, bringing every cliché about the character type to the role and still seeming fresh and original. Vince Vaughn, Richard Schiff, and Vanessa Lee Chester also turn in solid performances.Steven Spielberg is a master filmmaker, and before he was into film just for the money, he took pleasure in making films. This isn't his best film by any stretch of the imagination, but it's also a lot better than most sequels.",The Lost World - Jurassic Park

117,mfellipecampos,Good,7,22 November 2019,"The Lost World: Jurassic Park is a 1997 American adventure and sci-fi movie directed by Steven Spielberg, the second of the Jurassic Park franchise. The film was produced by Gerald R. Molen and Colin Wilson. The script was written by David Koepp, based on Michael Crichton's novel The Lost World. The film stars Jeff Goldblum, Julianne Moore, Vince Vaughn, Pete Postlethwaite, Richard Schiff, Arliss Howard, Thomas F. Duffy, Vanessa Lee Chester and Richard Attenborough. Four years after the events of Jurassic Park, dinosaurs have been secretly living on a desert island without human interference.

Ludlow assembles a team to the island to bring the animals to the continent to generate revenue for the company. Hammond sees the chance to redeem himself for his past mistakes by sending an expedition led by Dr. Ian Malcolm to the island before Ludlow's group gets there. The two groups face a great danger and must come together for their own survival. The movie is good but loses the prestige, here is no worse! It was also a commercial success and what is worth it is the special effects. Even with the well-known actors, their acting is no big deal left a bit to be desired.

118,meydiana-65242,Excellent Sequel,9,4 April 2021,"Creating a worthy follow-up to a major blockbuster is no easy task. But if all the pieces are in the right place, it is not impossible. Four years after the enormous success of Jurassic Park, Steven Spielberg took control of the director's chair once more in an effort to enhance the franchise and add on to his already spectacular legacy. Did he succeed? In the eyes of most critics, no. However, I applaud Mr. Spielberg for an admirable effort and creating another crowd-pleaser, even if it didn't match up to the high expectations.On another personal note, I was very happy to see Jeff Goldblum reprise his role as Dr. Ian Malcolm as he has always been my favorite character in the series. Since Malcolm is now more aware of the dangers of John Hammond's activities, his personality is less goofy and more serious this time around compared to his previous adventure.It took several viewings for me to appreciate this film to its fullest. At first, it seemed weak because it sacrificed the philosophical messages that helped make the first film great to fit in more action. The philosophy is found in one of the key quotes by John Hammond. ""Life will find a way."" There *is* a point to all the chaos because it is all caused by the humans and their relentless desire to interfere with nature. Every tragic event seen in the film could have been avoided with sensibility and that is the message that is echoed throughout the entire series. Don't attempt to control the uncontrollable.If there's one thing that makes the film worth watching, it has to be the special effects and the dinosaur animatronics. The infant T-Rex featured in this film is so lifelike that I often had to remind myself that it wasn't a real dinosaur. It was *that* convincing.Also be on the lookout for Vince Vaughn (before he became the mega-star that he is today) as one of Hammond's researchers and a humorous scene involving a T-Rex in the modern world.",The Lost World - Jurassic Park

I thought this was a spectacular sequel. It's pretty hard to beat the original, but I thought this one came pretty close to being just as good. I agree that the scene where the little girl did gymnastics and kicked the raptor out the window was one of the stupidest things Spielberg has ever done (in fact, if you ask me, they should have completely eliminated her character from the film). Also when Eddie Carr (Richard Schiff) yells to the people hanging on the rope and they respond with a fast-food order was another low point in the film. But these sort of scenes didn't ruin the film for me. Also, while I'm thinking about it, why do so many people have a problem with the T-Rex running around San Diego? That was AWESOME! I loved it! I really don't know why people have such a problem with that.As far as story goes, I thought it was a pretty well thought out story, nothing terribly complicated, but it got the job done. I don't really know what people are expecting, I went into the theater to see some dino's and I got what I wanted (and more). I did read the book before seeing the movie, even though I knew it would be drastically different, there were a few scenes that I had wished they'd put in the film, but you can't win 'em all.I thought the characters, acting and the cast were very good. I've always liked Jeff Goldblum, and he didn't let me down here. Other people that I believe deserve mention are Julianne Moore, Pete Postlethwaite, Richard Attenborough, Vince Vaughn, Peter Stormare, Richard Schiff, Joseph Mazello and Ariana Richards (even though those last two are barely in the film, but I was happy to see their cameos).As far as computer effects go...simply AMAZING!!! I would recommend seeing this film for the effects alone. They look even better than the original film, and there are a few scenes in particular that totally made the film for me. For instance, the scene when the two T-Rex's are attacking the car with Eddie Carr (Richard Schiff) is just phenomenal!!!All-in-all, I was VERY pleased with the movie and it wasn't a let down. If you liked the first one I think you should see this one and make your own conclusion instead of reading all these reviews and letting someone else make your decision for you. I hope you like the film as much as I did. ...Oh and be sure to watch Jurassic Park 3 after seeing this film.

121,Laakbaar,Not as good as the first one,6,4 June 2014,"This version of the Jurassic Park franchise had good CGI special effects. The dinosaurs were spectacular, and that is what we all flocked to these movies to see. As expected, there were several elaborate nail-biting scenes with characters in extremis because of the various carnivorous and vicious dinos. At times, the jungle scenes were even beautiful and evocative (I'm thinking now of the tiny dinosaurs scampering through the sun-lit riverbed).I enjoyed the first movie much more. This sequel lacked the magical quality of the first blockbuster. This sequel emphasised more how dangerous the dinosaurs are. ""Don't f*ck with mother nature because mother nature will f*ck with you."" In a way, the JP series evokes 19th c. notions of humanity's dominion over the earth, especially once the T-Rex starts roaring. In a movie like this, we revert to hunter-gatherers huddled around our safe fires while the megafauna roam dangerously about. ""Kill the evil dinosaurs!"" However, the exposition at the start was too long and most of the dialogue was not well written. There were various plot developments that seemed contrived or didn't seem right for other reasons. (For example, the ship ending exactly at the appointed spot despite having no crew.) Annoyingly, characters did obviously stupid things in various scenes (eg walk off from the group for some distance just to take a wee). The writers tried to make environmentalism a theme here, but this crashed and burned once the T-Rexes and velociraptors started doing their thing. The end game in San Diego should have gone into a separate movie.The acting by Goldblum and Moore was fine. They each have their own distinctive styles, which they brought to their parts. But to be honest of these actors are too good for a movie like this. Goldblum was stuck in his ""nature will find a way"" mode; Moore was his ""let me pet the baby dino"" foil. Moore was 37 when this was shot, but looks younger. Goldblum was significantly older. I didn't really see the two of them together, so their arguing scenes felt off to me. Kelly's character (the black daughter) didn't work for me at all.These two Jurassic Park movies were released in the mid-1990s, when America was the sole-standing superpower reaping the benefit of winning the Cold War, 9/11 hadn't happened yet, and the financial troubles to come were barely even on the horizon. American was on a high, and everyone was raking it in. Those were the days! Our troubles were confined, although if this movie is to be believed they had already been loose and were ready to destroy San Diego. I suppose we have this movie and its predecessor to thank for the endless parade of giant lizard monsters that we have to endure in the cinema nowadays (Pacific Rim, Godzilla, the new Transformers, and so on).I would give this movie an 8.5 on the basis of the CGI effects; however, the rest of it drags it down to a 6.5 or so.

124,dilipbts,The lost World Jurassic park,8,19 June 2020,"The Lost World: Jurassic Park continues the story of John Hammond as he summons chaos theorist Ian Malcolm to his home with some startling information, while nearly everything at his Jurassic Park had been destroyed, his engineers happened to have a second site, where other dinosaurs were kept in hiding. It seems the dinosaurs on the second island are alive and well and even breeding; and Hammond wants Malcolm to observe and document the reptiles before Hammond's financiers can get to them. Still directed by Steven Spielberg, we are brought a sequel to one of the most iconic films on the 90's, this sequel still brings the fun, humor and as much as you expect, more Dinosaurs. We are still brought the glimmering sight of the animatronics dinosaurs and some CGI ones as well, but Spielberg really took the time to make these reptilians so fundamental and pure. Besides the dinosaurs, Jeff Goldblum is another extravagant aspect of this film, he makes the film so jocular with his corny charisma, he really was the standing point for me in this. The film I will say does suffer from some pretty cringeworthy moments from some nonsensical dialogue and scenes that will make you sigh from incredulity. One reason I'm really grateful with this film is that we get to know more about the characters we come to know and love from the first film, I just love knowing more about characters that come to grow on you and just have a pleasure participating with there time. The action in this really dominates, it makes the storyline shift more to a side of the film that makes it more compelling than you think it'll be, it gives more fun to a story that you wouldn't expect to variate. Even though there isn't much strong tense moments, there are occasions where it can get pretty nerve racking, from malicious destruction from rapid creatures to violent beings, there is still a lot of excitement to take from and have fun with but at least it isn't dispiriting. Overall, The Lost World may not be as perfect as its predecessor but it's still one of the most fun sequels that we have been given in such a long time. We are still brought corny aspects, Jeff Goldblum, Dinosaurs, humor & even amusing action. TLW certainly delivers another roaring experience!",The Lost World - Jurassic Park

This time Hammond wants Malcolm to send in a team of specialists to go in and document the island where he wants to show the world that the dinosaurs are safe and not dangerous animals. Malcolm finds out that his girlfriend Sarah Harding (Julianne Moore) is already on the island and doesn't realize what she's getting into.With the team on the island, they track down Sarah and realize that Malcolm has another surprise that his daughter Kelly has sneaked in one of the trailers and disobeyed her father's orders of staying on the mainland.Another team is on the island not to document but to capture and retrieve the animals to make a zoo. The team is lead by Hammond's nephew Peter Ludlow (Arliss Howard in a bad English accent) who wants to make a profit after the company InGen suffers a lost in profit and damage from the original Jurassic Park. He gets a big game hunter name Roland Tembo (Pete Postelwaite) who wants to bag a Tyrannosaurus Rex as his trophy.The Lost World: Jurassic Park is great entertainment; the special effects are twice worthy than the original.

The story is interesting and has many twists and turns. The actors give amazing performances from everyone on the cast. The special effects like the original film, are amazing.

129,jhaggardjr,Exciting sequel,9,7 June 2000,"A lot of people may not have liked ""The Lost World: Jurassic Park"", but I'm not one of them. This is Steven Spielberg's very exciting sequel to his 1993 box office smash. It doesn't quite top the original, but it comes close. ""The Lost World: Jurassic Park"" is a much darker adventure. This time the action takes place on a different island 80 miles from where the first movie took place. Dinosaurs are roaming around and about on this island with no electric fences to block their way like on Jurassic Park. Jeff Goldblum returns as Dr. Ian Malcolm, who goes to this place when he finds out from Dr. John Hammon (Sir Richard Attenborough) that his girlfriend Dr. Sarah Harding (Julianne Moore) is already there. Once Dr. Malcolm gets there, along with a photographer (Vince Vaughn), a field equipment expert (Richard Schiff), and his daughter (Vanessa Lee Chester), he reunites with his woman and tries to warn her of the dangers that lurk around. Then more trouble comes. A second expedition steps foot on the island and what they plan to do is take the dinosaurs off the island to a theme park on the U.S. mainland. Things don't go as planned for either expedition when the dinosaurs begin to wreck havoc. The special effects are just as impressive as they were in the first film, with some new dinosaurs that weren't featured in ""Jurassic Park"". The sound effects are loud and scary as you would expect. But then again you would expect ""The Lost World: Jurassic Park"" to be a triumph in the technical departments. If there is one weakness here its with the human characters. The characters are a bit weaker than the characters from the first movie. The cast here is a good one though not as good as the cast in the original. One might expect Sam Neill or Laura Dern to drop in. Nevertheless, ""The Lost World: Jurassic Park"" is a lot of fun, and I enjoyed my time with it. ***1/2 (out of four)",The Lost World - Jurassic Park
130,SKG-2,Same strengths and weaknesses as the first one,7,24 February 1999,"In retrospect, Spielberg's adaptation of JURASSIC PARK not only made sense in financial terms, but also artistic.  I didn't read THE LOST WORLD, but most of Crichton's novels, while they're well-plotted, are straitjackets, told in a clinical fashion, as if he's trying to tell you how much better he is than you.  And the characters are usually one-dimensional at best, with the exception of a few here and there.  Where the film versions of RISING SUN, DISCLOSURE, and CONGO kept most of the book, and therefore were held back by it, the film version of JURASSIC PARK threw out the book and just kept the dinosaurs, which made it more entertaining, so we could forget about the fact that the characters were one-dimensional and the plot is right out of a (bad) 1950's sci-fi movie.This sequel is, in most senses, a carbon copy of the original.  It has the same strengths (the dinosaurs, Jeff Goldblum) and weaknesses (lack of character development, watered-down story).  The primary difference is this is more of a straight-ahead action movie than the original, and Spielberg is in control there.  Also, Julianne Moore and Pete Postlethwaite do a lot with a little.",The Lost World - Jurassic Park
131,Al_The_Strange,"""What you study, you change.""",7,14 June 2015,"In the events of Jurassic Park, an entrepreneur's dream of a living biological attraction ended with bloodshed and terror. Despite the threat of dinosaurs rampaging out of control, businessmen would still vie to reap the benefits of genetically-engineered beasts from ""Site B."" This follow-up to the hit 1993 film aims to provide more of the same - wit, color, and action - but on a bigger scale. There are more dinosaurs to behold. People deploy more cool vehicles and weapons to hunt and capture them. More people get eaten, more are chased across the jungle, and it all leads up to a crazy finale where a T-Rex runs amok in San Diego. There are a lot of fun setpieces to behold.There are a few things that mar the experience a little. Characters aren't quite as likable as in the first film; everyone's favorite chaotician returns and delivers plenty of sarcasm, but the family dynamic that's built around him doesn't congeal quite as well as it did with Dr. Grant and the kids in the first film. A lot of the characters in this film seem to make even dumber mistakes than in the first film, and many are unlikable. Some scenes are rather daft. Despite these issues, the plot takes off in interesting directions, showing how far a corporation will go to exploit nature. These events bring the threat of the dinosaur breakout to the civilized world in the end; the T-Rex's downtown carnage tends to be rather silly, but it does expand on the original theme that life cannot be controlled or tamed.This film sports pretty good-looking photography and editing. It is a much more drab and darker film, with a lot of nighttime photography. Acting is okay for what it is: Jeff Goldblum returns with his signature wit, but his character isn't always likable as he's always yelling at others trying to get them to listen to reason. Julianne Moore is playful in her role, but her character makes a few dumb decisions. Peter Postlethwaite is cool, Arliss Howard plays a dork we love to hate, Peter Stormare is the same, and everybody else I could take or leave. Writing is okay; there are amusing lines, but the dialogue is not as effortlessly colorful and fun as the first film. This production uses top-notch sets, props, costumes, and special effects. John Williams' music score takes the original theme and transforms it into a wonderfully adventurous tune.The Lost World has plenty of thrills and fun, some of which is bigger and bolder than in Jurassic Park. It's only hampered a bit by a few characters making a few dumb decisions, and a few silly scenes here and there. I always felt it was a fun follow-up, and if you enjoyed the first film, this should be worth seeing once.3.5/5 (Experience: Pretty Good | Story: Okay | Film: Good)",The Lost World - Jurassic Park
132,chrisbrown6453,"Oh no, not again!",8,14 August 2000,"Jurassic Park, of course, is a great movie.  No one in his or her right mind can say otherwise.  And in today's cinema market, any great movie is going to be followed by a sequel that may, or may not, live up to the first. Well, in the case of The Lost World: Jurassic Park, I can't help but feel that it fell just short of Jurassic Park's greatness, however being a great movie itself. The Lost World picks up 4 years after Jurassic Park left off.  The premise is that all the dinosaurs on the island that Jurassic Park took place on were transplanted there from another where they lived before being put into the `zoo' that Jurassic Park was to be.  There is a slight flaw in this though.  There is a scene in JP where a dinosaur egg is hatching, and we are led to believe that all are hatched in that lab on the island. In The Lost World, Dr. Ian Malcolm (Jeff Goldblum), is contacted by Jurassic Park creator John Hammond (Richard Attenborough) to help stop a group of hunters that want to catch these dinosaurs, and bring them to the mainland to be put on display. This is where most people that didn't like this movie began to get turned off.  The faction that wants to bring the dino's to the U.S. manage to get a T-Rex, among others, onto a ship, and set sail for San Diego.  Well by accident some veloceraptors hitched a ride too.            ***Warning***    ***Spoiler Ahead***
Ok, here is a major flaw in the movie.  When the raptors have killed everyone on the ship, who is left to navigate it to San Diego?  While I liked the scenes of a Tyrannosaurus Rex running free in downtown San Diego, many felt it was too `unrealistic'.  Yea, like having an island full of dinosaurs is more realistic. J Anyhow, The Lost World: Jurassic Park is a great film to compliment an even better film, and has also been a great film to hold us over until summer of '01 when a much anticipated JP:3 is released.I can't wait!",The Lost World - Jurassic Park
133,DavidSim240183,Magic's in short supply for JP2,4,29 December 2006,"I enjoyed Jurassic Park immensely back in 1993. In fact I enjoyed it so much I went back to see it a second time. A film must be something special if it prompts you to revisit it more than once at a cinema. JP may have been thinly plotted, but it was an exhilarating, thrilling adventure. First class entertainment. One of Spielberg's best.So when a sequel was announced in 1997, I was first in line to see it on opening night. I had my bucket of popcorn. My nerves were all a jangle. I was all set for a truly fun evening. And a funny thing happened. How thoroughly underwhelmed I was by the whole thing.The Lost World was perfectly watchable but not once did it stir feelings in me the way the original did. All the wonder, awe and joyous surges I was expecting to feel just didn't surface this time around.I started to get a sinking feeling about the film the moment Richard Attenborough mentions the existence of Site B, another island where the dinosaurs were bred before moved into the park.I mean how contrived can you get?! Building a complex on an adjoining island for the express purpose of breeding dinosaurs and then shipping them over to another island. After watching the original, I was under the assumption the dinosaurs were bred in the park. We even saw scenes with dinosaurs hatching from eggs.It's all been set up to construct a new scenario on a whole new island without fences or barriers. That's what passes for plot. In this case, the hero of the piece is Jeff Goldblum's character, chaotician Dr Ian Malcolm.Last time, after he was injured by Hammond's creations, he was pretty much sidelined for the remainder of the film. And here he's been allowed to take centre stage.Hammond lost control of InGen, the company that created Jurassic Park, after a family stumbled upon Site B and their daughter was injured by a bunch of ""Compys"", tiny scavengers that look cute but aren't anything of the sort. Hammond wants to learn the situation on Site B, and dispatches a team to do it, comprising Ian, his girlfriend, paleontologist Dr Sarah Harding (Julianne Moore), Hammond's incentive to get Ian there, as well as an animal rights activist and a photographer.InGen send their own team, made up of Hammond's nephew and a game hunter (Pete Postlethwaite) to bring back a few specimens to San Diego, and pick up where Hammond left off. Of course, the dinosaurs prove to be more than they can handle, and both teams must band together to survive.Plot-wise that's about it. The special effects are just as good as you'd expect. Better in some ways. All the dinosaurs are clearly defined. The T-Rexes. The Velociraptors. I can't complain there. And there are some fantastic action set-pieces. The wonderfully gripping scene when Ian and Sarah are trapped in a trailer slowly being pushed over a cliff by two T-Rexes. And the great moment with Raptors hiding in the long grass, pulling their victims under.But there isn't anything here that JP didn't do ten times better. TLW feels like a disjointed assemblage of action scenes with no rhyme or reason. They're there just for the sake of it. The actors do what they can, but even with stellar talent present like Goldblum, Moore and Postlethwaite, its not enough to save the film. There are just too many glaring plot-holes for the film to overcome.Being a Spielberg film, there has to be a kid present. And in this case, it's Ian's daughter, who's bizarrely Black, for some strangely never explained reason. She doesn't really add anything, and the way her character is introduced halfway through makes no sense at all.You can sit through TLW easily enough but it never engages the way the original did. There is nothing here that burns into your memory, like the T-Rex making its first appearance in JP, or the Raptors hunting the kids in the kitchen. Those were real nerve-shredding moments.And TLW has a frankly bizarre ending. A T-Rex is brought back to the mainland. It somehow slaughters the crew of the ship its aboard, even though its still contained. And then it gets loose in the city. Give me a break! This is not Godzilla or King Kong. But Spielberg seems to think it is.The Lost World is a sadly lacklustre follow-up to a very enthralling beginning. The wonder and awe the original elicited is sadly lacking here. By all means, if you're a fan of the JP series give this one a try, but like Spielberg's Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom, it's a mere shadow of previous greatness.",The Lost World - Jurassic Park

The first one had a truck hanging off the cliff, so why not a bus hanging off the cliff?The acting was horrible everyone deserves a double Razzie. The writing even worse. And this is after you have to believe these people would go back there without any problem after all that happened in the first one. The reasons were lame and rushed. If you wanna believe these people would just walk around on an island with dinosaurs without any problem you need a reality check.They made one bad mistake after another with no logic behind it whatsoever. Yeah, let's just go on an island filled with man-eating dinosaurs. No rational person would ever do this. I have never seen this many dumb characters ever fit into a film, but they managed to do it.It is so cringeworthy and an embarrassment to the first one, which is a classic.I'm shocked to find out Speilberg actually made this.

135,lagudafuad,not as good as the first,6,27 October 2012,"The Lost World: Jurassic Park II is a sequel to Jurassic Park which is based on a Michael Crichton book of the same name (The Lost World: Jurassic Park II). This sequel is not as good as the first and also not as exciting, the whole dinosaur in the city (Godzilla kind), saving your love from an expedition that could be her last was kind of a bore but like the first the sequel doesn't fail to fill you up with new knowledge about speculated behaviors dinosaur.This science fiction adventure film was directed by Steven Spielberg and prompted the first time Crichton will write a sequel to a book. The movie was made darker than that of the first and it was also a box office success, grossing $618 million worldwide, although the movie itself was not of critical acclaim on the bases mostly because fans had to wait 4 years to see this, and though it did have an excellent CGI, the story was not as thrilling as the first, and the cast was not as engaging.The movie plot didn't have Dr. Alan Grant (Sam Neill) and Dr. Ellie Sattler (Laura Dern) in it at all, even the park genius John Hammond and his grandchildren Lex and Tim, just appeared briefly in the beginning of the movie.The movie focuses on Jeff Goldblum who played Dr. Ian Malcolm the Chaos theorist.The film picks up four years after the events of Jurassic Park, and Dr. Ian has gone everywhere telling everybody who cares to know about what he faced in Jurassic Park. John Hammond (Richard Attenborough) who had lost control of InGen to his nephew, Peter Ludlow (Arliss Howard), invited Malcolm to his home to ask him to escort a team to a place called Site B.John explained to Malcolm that the island of Isla Sorna, also known as ""Site B"", is the island where the dinosaurs were initially engineered and nurtured for a few months, before being moved to the location of the park.He further explained that after the Jurassic Park incident, a hurricane destroyed the containment facilities on Isla Sorna, and the dinosaurs have been living free in the wild ever since, and they have found a way to survive.Malcolm initially refuses thinking back on the events and his near survival from the park four years ago, but agrees after learning that his girlfriend, paleontologist Sarah Harding (Julianne Moore), is part of the team and is already there at the island.So we are back with the dinosaurs again with only Malcolm having an idea of what they are capable of.There were scenes in the movie where the camera angles were well positioned, but the movie screenplay lapsed in thrills.Other than the movie not being so a good sequel, many elements from the original Jurassic Park novel that was not in the first film were used here. www.lagsreviews.com",The Lost World - Jurassic Park

138,stevenrotherforth,A film where a girl kicks a dinosaur by doing gymnastics! (Say no more),6,12 November 2017,"The Lost World.Steven Spielberg's second visit to the land of claws and teeth isn't nearly as good as the original but it does have some scenes that will go down in cinema history. But unfortunately for every great scene there's an equally dumb one.Set on the second island of Isla Sorna, an island that was suspiciously never mentioned in the original film. Apparently this is where the dinos are bred before being taken over to Isla Nubla where the park is situated. Anyway Dr Ian Malcolm's girlfriend, Sarah played by Julianne Moore is on this island taking snaps of the dinos and obviously she needs to be rescued. Why a woman is alone on an Island with man eating dinosaurs is beyond me? Perhaps that's it right there. They're man eating dinosaurs! (A subtle nod to the original movie). So off Malcolm (Jeff Goldblum) goes to rescue her. He tags along with a research team and they soon encounter a second team who are there with a totally different agenda. Before you know it, there's the running and the screaming and secondary cast members being munched in all sorts of gruesome ways.The Lost World isn't completely devoid of the magic that made the first film great, however it does seem that the people involved in making this film have tried to suck out as much magic as possible. Only Spielberg's fantastic direction and the superb cast try to deliver. This time around there's no Dr Grant or Ellie. Lex and Tim get only a brief appearance and John Hammond is bed ridden. Never the less, there is a good cast here. Goldblum seems to be the go to man to help save a franchise. Anyone who has seen the abysmal Independence Day sequel will know what I'm talking about. Vince Vaughn and Julianne Moore are strong support. Pete Postlethwaite is the show stealer and why he wasn't utilised more is quite the mystery. Regardless of this it was the original cast that helped conjure up the magic in the first film and sadly they're absent here.TLW is a much darker affair. Admittedly I agree getting chased by carnivorous dinosaurs is never going to be light hearted but there's just something missing. I think it maybe the large number of bad choices made by the script writers. Like I mentioned before, for every great moment there's a really stupid one! A great scene of the splintering glass window is masterfully directed by Spielberg, it is then quashed by a stupid scene when the young girl kicks a Velociraptor by performing a gymnastics routine!Another example is when the Velociraptors enter the long grass and we see their trails closing in on the victims. This is classic Spielberg. Only to be quashed by the T Rex arriving in San Diego. What did Rexy do? Did he kill everyone on board of the ship and then steer the vessel to port by himself? I think he'd struggle with those tiny little arms of his. Also he must have escaped containment, killed everyone then got back into containment and closed the lid! Eh?!!The First half of TLW is a decent movie then it seems that all creative control was taken away from the director and given to a bunch of morons that have never watched Jurassic Park. Rather than concentrating on making a plausible sequel, what we have is a very long commercial for a certain German car company. Taking the movie out of its correct environment and putting it into the city was perhaps one of the worst ideas in movie history. This is a 6/10 movie mainly due to the first half of the film. Still it's better than Jurassic Park III.",The Lost World - Jurassic Park

140,theshadow908,A very good follow up.,7,9 June 2006,"4 years after the events of Jurassic Park, John Hammond calls on Ian Malcolm and asks if he'd like to visit Jurassic Park Site B, an island without fences or boundaries where the dinosaurs were bred. Hammond wants to send Malcolm and three others to see how the dinosaurs are surviving. Ian initially refuses, but when he finds out that his scientist girlfriend is already on the island, he decides to go on a rescue mission. Upon arrival, the team discovers that Hammond's nephew has sent in another team to capture the dinosaurs for another attraction...This time in San Diego. The Lost World: Jurassic Park features more dinosaurs, more action, and the lack of boundaries gives it a more natural feel, making for a really exciting action film.One of my pet peeves is when a director doesn't want to do a sequel for his own movie. Luckily, Steven Spielberg knew this movie would be good and stayed on. His perfect style of direction is ever present making the style of the movie just as fitting as the first time around. I personally think the plot of this movie is better than the first. I like Sir Arthur Conan Doyle's The Lost World for the same reason. I like a plot that involves dinosaurs running free on an island. It allows for better and more open action scenes. The Velociraptors are far more terrifying than in the first film, and the addition of another T-Rex is genius. All of the new dinosaurs in this film are perfectly done. Quite honestly, The Lost World: Jurassic Park is just as good as the first in all ways but one...The acting.Jeff Goldblum was never a favourite actor of mine, but I thought he was okay in Jurassic Park. In this movie, he's back to the way I know him. He talks in that stupid voice all the time that he's been stereotyped with, and he is so wooden that it makes the giant trees surrounding him look like better actors. Vince Vaughn plays the same character he always does, the wise cracker with a funny voice. I'd have to say the best acting job in the film is done by Pete Postlethwaite, who plays a hunter intent on bagging a T-Rex.Overall, The Lost World: Jurassic Park is just as good as it's predecessor, but the acting is a little off.7.5/10",The Lost World - Jurassic Park
141,kdnor2011,A guilty pleasure,7,11 May 2010,"Is The Lost World: Jurassic Park technically a good movie? Well not really. As a film on it's own, it's OK, it has plenty of forgettable characters, plot holes in a few places and some comedy that really falls flat. As a sequel, it's mediocre, with a few inconsistencies here and there. And as an adaptation, it is absolutely terrible. I won't get into a long rant about how much they changed, but if you have read the book, then you will have almost no idea that the movie was supposed to be an adaptation.So why do I enjoy this movie. Well the action scenes are thrilling. The trailer scene alone makes this movie worth watching, but the T-Rex in San Diego is also pretty cool. Ian Malcolm is pretty hilarious and I like Tempo. And while the special effects aren't as mind blowing as they were in the first film they are still very good and a nice mix of practical and CGI.While not a very good movie, The Lost World is a pretty fun movie. It's a guilty pleasure, it sure isn't as good as the original, but I don't think it's nearly as bad as some people say.",The Lost World - Jurassic Park
142,Rammstein-2,"Surprise, surprise",3,6 July 2000,"(spoiler alert)This has to be one of the lousiest sequels ever made. It's running uphill against Under Siege 2, Speed 2 and Alien 4, but it's almost at pace with those awful movies.There is one thing I do like in this film - it's the part where the T-rexes push the camping-lab-van-whatever over the cliff. Despite the fact that the back part of the trailer, the one hanging down from the ledge, is upside-down, and despite the horrifyingly stupid attempt to drag the entire 20-ton trailer back up again with a 1,5 ton mercedes jeep (good luck), it's the one enjoyable moment of the film. Oh, and I like the dino that punches the car door straight through the car with its head.Actually, there is a scene that really sums up all the lousiness of this cheap we-want-more-money-sequel: it's a hyperbole, something I am convinced movies can do without. In the beginning, Malcolm's daughter sulks over her not managing to qualify for some gymnastic competition (or something like that) - and near the end this little kid performs a ""stunning"" move as she swings around and kicks a Raptor trough the wall. Yeah, right. Much like the merc pulling that trailer up.Well... I certainly have no hopes at all for the third Jurassic Park, which, I hope, will come too late to inspire yet another buying frenzy, which is really why they make the movies number two and three at all.",The Lost World - Jurassic Park

Atmosphere Is more tech savy and whimsical this time around with the hightec winnebagos as Only shelters. I really like that 80s styled fun. The beginning premise is as good as the original. It's well told In that spielberg blockbuster way. I love the Trex scene when they are high up in the treetops and its exhalarating and because the danger is kept hidden. Its an extremely good buildup for the cliffhanger scenes that follows. Julian moore is also a fav actress and a perfect choice for the heroine. Everythings exciting so far in the movie.. Then something happens.. what we see happens In every modern cgi movie ever made. They simply go overboard showing all cgi dinos. Bombasting us with ridiculous effects. The action sequenses that follows are redundant and yawning at best.. still I'm invested when they come to the raptor scene. Its not that great because they allready focused on making us a little bit tired with the stampeding cgi dinos. The movie never really gain momentum after this, and its kept medium. Then the last part off the movie turn itself into kingkong or godzilla wich i truly hate. Still.. The movie is well-made and semi-entertaining throughout and has somehow hold up to this day. So its not all bad for a sequel that really could have made jurassic park 2 alot more scarier and a real thrill ride with better action scenes and drama situations.

This movie didn't have charm, originality and grasping power like the original.The concept was same as original with some bad changes. The problem was that the execution of the idea was not good. Also, the acting wasn't that good. It was normal. I also missed the original cast.

148,mnpollio,Total dreck,3,7 March 2008,"After the success of both the book and film of the original Jurassic Park, it was a no-brainer that there would be a sequel. There were many directions that such a sequel could go, but Michael Crichton's intent to ""cash in"" was made evident when he not only stole the title of an Arthur Conan Doyle dinosaur story to christen his sequel, but pretty much recycled the story from the original with minimal revisions. He even stooped low enough to revive the character of Ian Malcolm from the dead and hope no one who read the original novel noticed. Spielberg apparently knows he is dealing with crap, so while he keeps the bare bones of the Crichton sequel, he throws in everything but the kitchen sink in an effort to inspire some form of excitement. Apparently there is a second island on which millionaire Richard Attenborough was breeding dinosaurs, which is now in danger of being plundered by his greedy nephew (Arliss Howard channeling Snidely Whiplash) and a group of hunters (led by an overacting Pete Postlethwaite). Sensibly, Attenborough turns for help to Jeff Goldblum's chaos theorist Ian Malcolm, the one character he despised from the original film and the one least qualified to lead such a venture. Yet because Goldblum was an entertaining and popular supporting character, there needed to be some thin reason to bump him to lead (Sam Neill and Laura Dern are sorely missed). Naturally, there is no reason for him to accept, but the plot conveniently gives him a paleontologist girlfriend (Julianne Moore), who is already on the island. This motley gang is completed by an oafish Vince Vaughn, dead meat character Richard Schiff and Goldblum's stowaway teenage daughter (the sublimely talentless Vanessa Lee Chester, who is excess baggage until her ""big"" moment when a velocirapter kindly stands still long enough for her to execute ludicrously complicated gymnastic moves to knock it through a window). It is hard to understand what this group hopes to accomplish against the far better organized hunting party, and indeed they accomplish nothing other than to place themselves in one degree of danger after another through chronic stupidity. Are we really to believe that Moore's character who has successfully lived on this island for weeks without incident is now capable of making the number of disastrous lapses in judgment that even a third-grade Boy Scout would avoid? The special effects are spectacular, but the characters are so thinly conceived and obnoxious that they fail to even register as the ""types"" presented in the original film. Goldblum's elevation to leading status here is also a misconception - for 2+ hours he kvetches, he moans, he wrings his hands, he rattles off criminally unfunny gag lines, and basically demonstrates why this character was better used in support. Departing completely from the novel, the concluding moments attempt to drum up suspense by bringing a T-Rex to San Diego (not exactly an exciting landmark city!) to run amok. Amazingly, the T-Rex devours the entire crew of the boat carrying it to San Diego, and then locks itself back in the hold. The carnage in San Diego is almost lackluster and relegated to the T-Rex chasing some Japanese tourists and devouring a family dog in front of a caricaturish yuppie couple and their rather underwhelmed tot, before conscientiously returning to the hold of the boat to do away with the asinine cardboard villain. The visual effects are terrific, but the same cannot be said of the acting, writing, editing or direction, which is incredibly uneven and unfocused for Spielberg. A total mess.",The Lost World - Jurassic Park
149,rollernerd,Mamma is angry,7,13 January 2021,"Welcome to another edition of Adam's Reviews!! **queue in intro music**Tonight's movie review is action packed sci-fi flick, The Lost World: Jurassic Park (1997), the sequel to the blockbuster hit Jurassic Park. So, when you'd think that scientists would realize dinosaurs and humans don't mix, we still have rich people trying to be gods. Four years after the disaster in the theme park billionaire John Hammond asks chaos theorist and all-time cool dude Dr. Ian Malcolm, played by Jeff Goldblum, to observe and document the dinosaurs on a second island, Isla Sorna, or Site B where other dinosaurs have been created through DNA cloning, in order to prevent the company he once owned, InGen to take over the island for commercial reasons. First hesitant, Malcolm decides to make the trip when he finds out that his girlfriend, palaeontologist Dr. Sarah Harding played by Julianne Moore is already there. So, we have a rescue mission, which as you might have guessed turns into a survival mode where man-eating creatures prowl around.The sequel is good with Steven Spielberg once again taking control of the director's chair but it doesn't match up to the high expectations delivered by the first. We have a few cool characters but not compelling enough to wow you. The character Roland Tembo played by the late legend Pete Postlethwaite is a world-class hunter who is trying to go man-o-man against T-Rex in order to get a trophy. Great character and such a shame we didn't see much of him as it would've been cool to see more of his hunting skills.The flick has impressive special effects especially with T-Rex hitting up mainland San Diego and coming across civilians and even a pet dog. The acting in this is not at the same level as the first however the character development of the T-Rex parents' are cool as, they due to showing maternal and territorial instincts when their baby is taken from them.There are a few plot elements which does not make sense and my guess is it was put in there just for the sake of it. This includes a massive plot hole aboard the discovered freighter - like how and why? Wasn't T-Rex sealed and contained??Awesome to see Jeff Goldblum back as chaos dude Dr. Ian Malcolm and this time he is less goofy and more serious due to what happened in the previous movie. Spielberg directs an awesome set piece of the trailer dangling off a cliff due to angry T-Rex parents' and where Malcom vs hungry raptors. This film has real suspense and thrills for a Friday night popcorn flick. Similar to its predecessor, don't attempt to control things that are uncontrollable which makes sense, overall, 7.4/10",The Lost World - Jurassic Park
150,projectsgamer,8/10,8,22 March 2021,The Lost World Jurassic Park first time watching was great but when I rewatched it today it felt boring the supporting characters are weak Jeff Goldblum Sarah as a character is actually annoying she goes on and on and on for too long I do enjoy this movie the dinosaurs look great the ending in this movie in San Diego is amazing but I do understand a little bit of the of the movie where Jeff Goldblum has to go back to the island to save his girlfriend while that happens it goes south than there is a military going there to set up Jurassic park which fails because Jeff Goldblum saves the dinosaur than the mom dinosaur wants the baby back goes so south So All round The Lost World on second rewatched it felt little bit boring at times So I give The Lost World Jurassic Park a B-,The Lost World - Jurassic Park
151,ExpendableMan,The weakest of the three but still a decent ride,5,23 November 2006,"The Lost World: Jurassic Park has come in for a fair bit of flak over the years from critics, most of whom see it as little more than a shallow re-tread of the original but with more plot holes and less of the charisma. This is true to an extent, but that isn't to say it's a bad film. Approached in the right frame of mind it can make for a great night in, especially if you have a massive television accompanied by surround sound speakers to help you get lost in the thundering carnage, you just have to make sure you switch off those departments in your brain labelled ""cohesion"" and ""reason"" beforehand.Set several years after the original, it sees park creator John Hammond (Richard Attenborough) coercing the now ruined Ian Malcolm (Jeff Goldblum) to take another trip to an island filled with monstrous prehistoric reptiles that all want to eat him. This isn't the same island as the first though, this is 'Site B,' sort of a nature reserve to the original's theme park where the dinosaurs roam free with no fences to hold them in and are allowed to thrive in their own right. Malcolm and a small team comprised of zoologists, photographers and Vince Vaughn soon find things going awry when a large group of evil capitalists with no respect for the natural order of the island arrive tooled up to the shoulders with all kinds of expensive weaponry with the intention of capturing enough dinosaurs to start a new park. And faster than you can say ""this takes a few liberties with Velociraptor design"" all involved find themselves turning into a delightful buffet for the local dinos.If Jurassic Park was an adventure story and Jurassic Park 3 was a rather fun B-movie, The Lost World is the action hero of the series. Hardly any time is wasted before we see the dinosaurs and shortly after, all sorts of chaos is being unleashed. The highlight of this is an attack by two T Rexes on a trailer which is easily the equal to the first film's Rex assault, it's just a shame that the rest of the film doesn't quite match up.Sure, the dinosaur's pursuit of the human teams through the jungle is all very exciting, but there's little of the careful increase in tension that the first film did so well bar the aforementioned trailer scene. It's simply a case of ""show dinosaur, people die"" repeated several times over and on closer inspection, is nearly a complete re-tread of 'Aliens,' with the raptors standing in for the aliens and the Rex standing in for the Queen. The ending is even very similar, with the Rex being brought back to an urban metropolis for a final showdown, just as the alien queen was brought back to the Solaco.That said, it's still an enjoyable romp. The plot holes are too numerous to count but nonetheless, it's still easy to get caught up in the quick pace. It also has a top notch cast to back it up; Jeff Goldblum is just as watchable as he ever was, Vince Vaughn dispels with the funny guy routine and instead goes on a testosterone overload as a macho environmentalist and Pete Postlethwaite even puts in an appearance as a great white hunter (his line upon first encountering Vaughn incidentally is worth the price of entry alone). It may tread an uneasy line between the ridiculous and the entertaining, but it isn't half as bad as it's sometimes made out to be.",The Lost World - Jurassic Park
152,NightmareOnElmStreetFan,"Pure entertainment decent action, adventure thrill ride, my third personal favorite film in the franchise",8,8 February 2019,"I had fun entertainment I enjoy Dinosaur T-Rex in a city San Diego the chase and eating people, I had fun with that sequence. We have pure entertainment decent action - adventure thrill ride San Diego is a satisfying finale for me. Sarah shoots a tranquilizer dart at T-Rex, and Malcolm closes the hold's doors at the ship cargo that scene was a bad-ass awesome. Julianne Moore as Dr. Sarah Harding was good in this movie, I like her she was one of the reason I like watching this movie and I still will watch it. Jeff Goldblum as Ian Malcolm was decent and likable I like him. Pretty good special effects, the CGI work for 1997 are pretty decent they are some nice practical effects as well.I had fun entertainment with the sequence where Jeff Goldblum, Julianne Moore and Vince Vaughn are in this vehicle and it is been pushed off the cliff. No sequence was there after they get out of there, I like that sequence. Ian, Sarah and Kelly are fighting a group of raptors that have chased them into the facility I like that sequence. You see on a rooftop Sarah holding and raptor try's to eat her and she tricks him so that raptor falls down on another raptor and they start fighting each other I like that sequence.The Lost World: Jurassic Park (1997) is a decent action adventure film at best decent sequel to a classic Jurassic Park, I enjoy it. This is a good decent movie but it is my third favorite film of the three. It is miles way better than Jurassic World I enjoy this movie more than that movie and Jurassic Park III, I like the third Jurassic Park but I enjoy this one more.I love Pete Postlethwaite as Roland Tembo as famous animal hunter he was awesome, I seriously I love the actor and his character. R.I.P. I really miss the actor I love his lines. He was the only one who capture the T-Rex and survived in this movie I enjoy the character so much I miss the actor.Steven Spielberg return to direct this movie and he was good I love his direction and his vision about the movie. Michael Crichton write another book to original classic novel and movie Jurassic Park. So this movie was based on his book and I have enjoy the film I watch it now the second time around. It is not better movie than the first one but a solid sequel.John Williams did return as music composer and he did return with his theme music score, not a bad music score.Returning Richard Attenborough as John Hammond was a good idea I like his character but I wish his character would have more to do, but he was only in a cameo scene. R.I.P. I also miss the actor it is a shame the actor also passed away.Steven Spielberg did not a bad job directing the film, I like his direction in this movie. Not a bad direction I love the jungle on a B site island.The Lost World: Jurassic Park it is my third personal favorite film of the trilogy, still I will watch it. I wish there would be more dinosaurs in this more, action sequences like the first movie had. More fast pacing not slow, more interesting story and so on.

154,luke-a-mcgowan,"The Lost World boasts simply incredible visuals, a lovable cast, a novel idea and a lingering sense of ominous dread. I could never have asked for more in a sequel.",8,6 June 2015,"Where do you go when you've created one of the best popcorn thriller films of all time? Many of the haters of The Lost World wouldn't be able to answer that question. Meanwhile, I believe that Spielberg and Koepp found the right way to go about it, and created an delightfully ominous sequel with enough substance that it can proudly stand beside the original.The Lost World is noticeably different to the first, which Spielberg, Crichton and Koepp deserve credit for. They haven't just remade the first one all over again. They've brought back the stuff we loved - water vibrations, the wonderful score, Jeff Goldblum - and added plenty of new stuff so that this film can stand on its own.I love the feel of The Lost World. There is some terrific tension, some outstanding drama and I never once felt that I was watching a set - its a real place. Two of the greatest scenes in the film are Sarah on the glass, and the slow ruts carved in the grass as the raptors close in. Its so tense and yet beautiful in its simplicity. My absolute favourite scene are Eddie's attempts to rescue Nick, Sarah and Ian from the trailer. Everything that can go wrong does go wrong. And when the T-Rexes show up to attack Eddie, I groaned in sympathy, for what else could possibly go wrong? Even the jump scares in this movie were effective.What always set Jurassic Park aside from its popcorn thriller counterparts is its wonderful cast. The original had a beloved trio of characters and even beloved minor characters like Robert Muldoon. This film takes that formula and even manages to improve on it. Kelly isn't as good as Lex and Tim, but the writers made a wise choice in focusing on Ian Malcolm as the film's protagonist, wheras the previous film sidelined him for most of the movie. Of the new additions, I loved Julianne Moore as Sarah, Vince Vaughn was surprisingly believable as Nick, the ever-underrated Richard Schiff is terrific as sardonic Eddie Carr, and Arliss Howard strikes the perfect note as the villainous Peter Ludlow. He isn't diabolical, but rather snobbishly set in his ways, and he fits the film perfectly. But by far the best character in the film was Pete Postlethwaite's Roland Tembo. His opening monologue sold me on him before he even got halfway through it. He's fast-talking, knows what he wants and doesn't suffer fools. I would have loved to see more of him. The VISUALS of this movie! I never fully appreciated the animatronics of Jurassic Park until I saw this film as well. The highest compliment I can possibly offer is that the dinosaurs look real. I could touch them and I can tell what they'd feel like. A small dinosaur headbutting a car door, and a T-Rex chomping on a traffic light are the two highlights of just how seamlessly the visuals blend with the reality. These days, the dinosaurs would be 100% computer animated, and that is a dreadful shame, because present day films can't capture even a fraction of the wonder of this film.Yes there are a few flaws. The opening scene raised the stakes so high, until John Hammond reveals that the young girl survived. Not only is this completely unbelievable (when looking at Dieter's fate later in the film) but it makes the opening scene obsolete. They should've just told the story without showing us, because the appeal of Jurassic Park is its ominous tone.At times, the camera cuts away from crucial moments, but considering that they were limited to what they could create at the time I can forgive it. Dieter's death is the most obvious example - he runs behind a log and gives up the fight instantly so he can die off camera. Yes the gymnastics scene was a bit silly, but I didn't mind in the scheme of things. The T-Rex stomping through San Diego felt both tacked on and required a huge suspension of disbelief (no one hears it stomping around) and there are a few major plot holes (namely, if the T-Rex devoured the crew of the ship, why was it still trapped? A deleted scene was meant to show that raptors did it, but then where did they go?)But I won't end on a low. The Lost World boasts simply incredible visuals, a lovable cast, a novel idea and a lingering sense of ominous dread. I could never have asked for more in a sequel.",The Lost World - Jurassic Park

156,ApolloBoy109,I wanted more.,7,16 July 2001,"I have kept my thoughts silent on the matter of this sequel for 4 years. I saw it again last night for the 20th time and felt the need to comment.Agreeing that books and films are total different animals, I'll move to ask: What was wrong with the plot in Critchon's popular sequel: The Lost World. It could have been adapted for the screen. Period. Instead, we are given a weak first reel which includes, the return of Tim, Lex and John H; poor exposition involving Ian's attempt to expose InGen; and the girlfriend setup.The second reel tried & failed to capture the intimate quality of its predecessor, which balanced the CGI effects in JP1. I liked Dr. Grant, and Ellie and the kids -- they were real. I cared about them. I did not care for Sarah Harding or Nick. Liked Eddie though. The kid I could have done without. Vince Vaugan supplied testesterone and nothing else. Eddie was an interesting character in the book. It was odd that they switched Eddie and Nick around. The biggest travesty was sending an army of men to the island, because we all knew they were nothing but Raptor Snacks. The scene where most of the cast gets killed in a flurry of tails, and tall grass was a very cheap way to dispatch the army guys. They served their purpose - so let's find the most economic way of getting rid of them. The center- piece of the 2nd reel was the Camper Over a Cliff (hanger) which featured more camp than camper. The glass cracking was just too much. Great suspense.For a movie about dinosaurs, JP2 felt dino empty. Did anyone expect people to believe the scene in which Raptors suddenly change from jumping and killing humans to stalking and attacking each other just so we can have a ten second thrill ride with Wonder Woman crashing, diving and finally falling to safety. It was dumb.To the third reel. Spielberg does Godzilla in San Diego with Ian and Harding going above the law for their convictions. Where was Nick? Why didn't the guards shoot them when they stole the junior dino? And folks, I can't buy into the fact -- that everyone on board the ship was killed without ever warning the coast that they were in trouble. How did T-Rex get his head through the small door of the ship's bridge to bite a crew member (leaving only a hand clutching the helm). Okay! OKAY! It's a movie. I understand. But I resent the smell of by-the-number formula. Koepp is brilliant, hands down.So I went with it. And yes, I love it too.Anyway I am going to JP3 Wednesday and I'm hoping for adventure and excitement, a little blood and some scares.",The Lost World - Jurassic Park
157,Varlaam,S-O-O-O-O-O much better than the first one,6,11 December 1998,"Even if the plot is just a rehash of King Kong.There is an obvious parallel with Alien(s): Vol. 1 is a thriller, Vol. 2 is an action picture. For Vol. 3, Jeff Goldblum will need a reason to shave his head and/or give birth. There is also a parallel with Wayne's World 1 and 2: the first one was stupid, the second less stupid.Jurassic Park was for kids. The Lost World is a light snack for adults with lots of funny dialogue. This film might be Dumb, but the first one was definitely Dumber. I don't recall a Hemingway joke in Jurassic Park. And The Lost World doesn't have dinosaurs who know how to open doors, or roll cigarettes with one hand (sorry, that last one's a bit of an embellishment).The Lost World does not have a repeat of that horrible, obnoxious, rude, unladylike Laura Dern character from the first one, thank goodness. The Julianne Moore character is the substitute here, although she is not without her problems. She is responsible for the sickeningly cute injured baby dino plot element which is the chief give-me-a-break issue this time around. If you try to carry a frightened animal, it will instinctively try to bite or scratch you. Unless it's a T. rex ""infant"" apparently. Sort of the Barney of the Jurassic Era. Cuddly.

159,geminiredblue,We Have A T-Rex 2!!,8,16 June 2015,"JURASSIC PARK is a sci-fi/action classic directed by the maestro Steven Spielberg himself. After it became such a hit, sequels were pretty much a given. THE LOST WORLD (AKA: THE LOST WORLD: JURASSIC PARK) takes place some time after the events of the first film. Ian Malcolm (Jeff Goldblum) is perplexed to discover from John Hammond (Richard Attenborough, looking old and frail) that they had worked on a second Jurassic Park. What's even more perplexing is that his old girlfriend Sarah Harding (the always delightful Julianne Moore) has gone to the island to study the new breeds of dinosaurs. Going along as part of a research/ rescue team, Ian hates to have his chaos theory proved right... again! Second time around, there's less of the sense of wonder that the first film inspired when we see the dinosaurs. Now, they've been turned more into just movie monsters that stomp around and eat the disposable actors. Ignoring the annoying sub-plot involving the capture of a baby T-Rex and his angry parents, the film is still worthwhile.

The first Jurassic Park movie took its time to build tension and explain a lot about dinosaurs. This time, the explanation is minimal and the movie jumps almost right into the action. After that, it's just a series of action scenes in which a lot of people get eaten.The point is, you can tell from beforehand which people will survive, and you don't care about the characters that do get killed because they have no depth at all, you usually don't even know their name. On top of that, a lot scenes seem to have been omitted from the movie, as their is often no cohesion between the scenes, and the 'story' jumps in all directions, including a totally unnecessary trip to L.A.To sum it up: this movie is incredibly shallow and lacks any kind of involvement. It's a disgrace to Steven Spielberg.",The Lost World - Jurassic Park
162,jerekra,Tyrannosaurus Was The Key.,9,8 February 2009,"The Lost World is a sequel that is often said to be vastly inferior to Jurassic Park. While I agree that Jurassic Park is the better film, The Lost World is a very good film as well.Ian Malcolm and three others travel to Isla Sorna. While they are there to just observe the dinosaurs and how they have adapted. A group of hunters/entrepeaneurs travel to the island as well intent on capturing various dinosaurs and putting them into a zoo back in the United States.The story is pretty easy to follow. I like how they expanded the story from the first film and make references to ""Jurassic Park"" as well.Acting was very good for the most part. Jeff Goldblum is awesome as always and though many people miss Grant in this film, I think that Malciolm is cool to see as the lead character. I did not really like Julianne Moore as the female lead in this film. NOt anywhere near as good as Laura Dern in ""Jurassic Park"".THe dinosaurs made this film. The velociraptors return and are as scary and terrifying as always. Computer graphics are used a lot for the dinosaurs in this film and for the most part it all looks pretty good and realistic.The Tyrannosaurus returns. For me the Tyrannosaurus made the film and is the main reason it is such a good film. Tyrannosaurus gets in a lot of action going after the hunting party, pushing trailers off cliffs, and going on a rampage through the city. I love how they pay respect to the original Lost World film by bringing the Tyrannosaurus back to the city the same way in the original Lost World they bring back a Brontosaurus. Tyrannosaurus going on a rampage through the city works so well and is the best part of the film. In fact the rampage Tyrannosaurus goes on is better than what the 1997 Godzilla did.The Tyrannosaurus is not just a rampaging monster in this film. Also it is portrayed as being a very loving and caring parent in how it takes care of its baby. Tyrannosaurus takes very good care of its baby in this film and I like how they added these parenting scenes.There also are a few new dinosaurs that appear in this film including Pachysaphalasaurus, Parasaurolophus, and Compsognathus. New dinosaurs are always good to see.I love this film. Jeff Goldblum is great, there is lots of action, but the Tyrannosaurus for me made the film. Highly recommended.",The Lost World - Jurassic Park
163,carlos37andre,A lot of fun,6,17 May 2020,"I'm revisiting the Jurassic Park movies. I'vent seen them since I was 5 or 6 (about 15 years ago) so I'm basically seen them for the first time, and knowing what I know, I went to this movie didn't expecting much, knowing people don't like this one nearly as much as the first. But overall, I had fun with it, and my family did as well.At first, I thought it would suffer from the element of ""man, we didn't have as much Dinos in the first one, we have to fill this one with Dinos"". And sure, this movie has way more Dinos all throughout when you compare to the first one, and mostly for the first 30/40 minutes of it, I thought the CGI was somehow worst than the first one. However, after the T-Rex appears, I thought the movie had some great moments. I love the animatronics they used here, the T-Rex almost never seen like they are CGI, like the first one, but still, here we have way more scenes with the T-Rex than in the first one. The T-Rex baby is also great!We get some great Ian moments, some great scenes, like the Velociraptors in the fields, the T-Rex splitting a guy in half, Juliane Moore's character falling in a glass almost breaking in one of the most suspenseful scenes I've seen in a while, etc etc. I think it could definitely have had 15ish minutes less than it ended up having, and overall, the characters are way dumber here when compared to the first. But still, when you compare with a movie like Jurassic World 2 (again, ""we have to come back to the Island, for... some reason"" story), I had way more fun watching The Lost World (and it's 20 years older).One thing I will say tho, for some reason, I didn't like the score here as much as I liked the first one's. I actually went and looked afterwards, if it was really John Williams that did it, and... it was. Idk tho, I found it oddly different from the first one, and not nearly as impactful when we most needed it to be.I truly didn't care for any characters that weren't Ian tho, and that's probably a downside. The finale is a bit... unnecessary I would say (and definitely foreshadowing what came next), even thought I loved the Dino in the city scenes. The chase, and almost every aspect of the scene is well made, and entertaning, is just... rushed, idk. I hope they can get this right in JW3 (I haven't seen JP3 yet, but since everyone hates it, I'm not with high expectations).The gymnastic scene? Sure, it's sooo dumb lol. I laugh when I saw it. It's probably the dumbest thing in the whole film.Overall tho, I think the movie is a lot of fun, I have some minor issues with the first minutes and the setup of it all, some parts are really predictable, the villains are... of course, just bad cause... reasons. But it's fine. More than 20 years later, the movie holds up, and aged well, has some fun stuff and iconic scenes, and of course, I love Jeff Goldblum in it.Obs: That final shot is insanely good, it's probably the first day light scene, in both movies, that the CGI is great, and even today, seems as real as you could get from most movies (but 20 years older).6,5/10",The Lost World - Jurassic Park
164,gitrich,The Lost World is a LOST CAUSE!,5,2 November 1998,I was not expecting The Lost World to be as good as the original. Most follow up films are not. But this was not even close! Jeff Goldblum's performance leaves a lot to be desired compared to the original thriller. The only acting triumph was Vanessa Lee Chester as Dr. Malcolm's daughter. Do yourself a favor and pass this one up folks!,The Lost World - Jurassic Park
165,Indy-52,it's great!,9,1 September 1999,"i really enjoyed this movie in the theatre, it's certainly the most entertaining film of 1997! This movie is definitely worthy of being a sequel of Jurassic Park: i'm not saying it's better than JP, but it comes very close. I know that the plot isn't as good as the one the original had, but i had a great time seeing it, and that's the only reason we go to see a movie, isn't it?   I came out of the theatre shaking almost as much as when i came out of JP back in 1993. The most suspenseful moment of the film was when Sarah is above the breaking glass: man, my heart was really beating fast! Also the ending (with the T-rex running around San Diego) was great and it was totally unexpected.       I recommend this movie to anyone who liked the first and anyone who knows how to have fun!",The Lost World - Jurassic Park

There's much better special effects, there's more action, there's much more dinosaurs (though I missed the one who's spitting poison), there's more catastrophes and there's much higher body account (the best thing about it is that most of the victims deserved to die). Jeff Goldblum get more of the show this time, but his character was kinda dull this time (probobly to make this film more realistic, because he has suffered a lot). I liked the first part, but compared to this one it seems so poor to me.",The Lost World - Jurassic Park

The team wants to capture images and videos of the historic animals to prove to the world that they exist, except for Prof Ian who understand the danger of it and tries his best to stop them, especially adventurous Prof Sarah, and leave the island ASAP before it's too late, but unfortunately no one listens to Ian, and then comes in trouble from the dinosaurs, who cannot be tamed.Faster paced than JP 1, the lost world is definitely an edge of the seat thriller, though this is also draggy at places. The special effects are quite remarkable, and this time the action is extended even beyond the dinosaur lairs.

It's got slightly less overt product placement.9. It dispenses with the pseudo-science babble and gets straight to monsters eating people. LOST WORLD's primary virtue is the enlarged cast of dinosaur bait, in the persons of Blonde from Fargo, Private Cowboy et al.8. One imperiled child is better than two, even though this one delivers one of the genre's most embarrassing moments when she does a ludicrous gymnastic routine to avoid being eaten. Which would have been better.7. The straight-up adventure format allows for maximum face-time between beast and human, in much more inventive confrontations.6. This one starts fast and never stops - within a half hour dinosaurs have screaming men in their mouths, a motif repeated with happy consistency for another 90 minutes.5. The trailer-over-the-cliff set piece alone is worth three JURASSIC PARKs. Julianne Moore falling on that spiderwebbed glass window, and Arliss Howard trying to get ropes and winches and Mercedes to help, is one of the best-executed sequences I've seen in a long life of watching not very well-executed summer pictures.4. I always wanted to see a Tyrannosaur knock a bus into a Blockbuster.3. Jeff Goldblum has more screen time.2. Sam Neill doesn't have any.1. Neither does Wayne Knight.Okay, it's also very stupid. Yes it is. Anybody who can't forgive it for that gymnastic thing is justified in my book. There's also a handful of idiocies, like Julianne Moore ""working with predators since I was 20"", then hanging up a blood-soaked jacket like a windsock above a sleeping child; like a 40 foot lizard getting through customs and into downtown San Diego without INS paperwork or at least a police escort.Whatever.

169,robsta23,I Remember it Being Better... Then I Again I Didn't Remember it That Well,6,17 May 2015,"Although I think Spielberg is an overrated director, I have to admit I really like a lot of his movies. This one is a film by Spielberg that I'm not THAT fond of.A lot of magic of the original Jurassic Park is missing in this sequel. Spielberg filled the first one with aspects of spectatorship such as the fact that the characters were on a ride in a theme park - an attraction of sorts. Screaming from the children was also a commentary on how we should react to Jurassic Park and its effects. Lost World is also lacking great subtlety which the first provided, such as the Jaws style suspense of not showing the T-Rex at first, but showing the goat disappearing without showing how.While Hammond was making a mistake in the first film according to the archaeologists and the Goldblum character, in this film he just seems plain stupid, putting people into danger again after the ""accident"" at the park, as they refer to it in this film. It was also a poor choice to make the Goldblum character the main character for this sequel. Since he was made the protagonist, he had to be more serious, and the quirkiness of his character was transferred to his girlfriend played by Julianne Moore.I've been ripping on this movie for a while now, so I'll say that I enjoyed the effects that created the dinosaurs of this film just as I did with the first film. The dinosaurs still made the movie exciting, especially the addition of the small green ones which eat up people together in herds. The wonder is also missing in the sense that the dinosaurs in this film are portrayed more as dangerous than something to gaze in awe at - that's what the first film was for.A decent sequel which I wouldn't re-visit too often; I'd prefer to just watch the original Jurassic Park on its own when I get in the mood for dinosaurs.",The Lost World - Jurassic Park

If anything the movie is too long, the last 30 minutes should never have been shot.Considering this is a sequel to JP1 and directed by Speilberg it is a major disappointment. Most of the characters are card board and many of the situations are boringly predictable and contrived. The entire T-Rex in the city sequence makes a mockery of the island portion of the story. There is no explanation for who or what killed the ships crew but it had to be small enough to fit through the bridge door.6/10 worth watching if your a gore/sci-fi fan and if you forget about Speilberg and JP1.",The Lost World - Jurassic Park
171,ryan_kuhn,"""Just follow the screams.""",6,29 April 2005,"The Lost World: Jurassic Park, or Jurassic Park II as most people have called it, is one of those sequels that existed primarily because Jurassic Park made lots and lots of money. That's not to say that The Lost World is a terrible movie, but it reeked of ""we only made this to make more money."" Even when i read the Michael Crichton book, I had the same feeling. The book did irk me more than the movie did. In the book, Crichton killed off a character who all of a sudden was magically alive in the sequel. At least in the movie, the people who were dead in Jurassic Park stayed dead in The Lost World. This movie follows Ian Malcom (Jeff Goldblum) who becomes the only member of the party who toured Jurassic Park to go public with his story. Now a scientific outcast, Malcom is offered the chance to check out a second dinosaur island for former owner John Hammond (Richard Attenborough). Malcom goes to the island with a new party of Dr. Harding (Julianne Moore), Nick (Vince Vaughn), and Eddie (Richard Schiff), with a special appearance by Ian's daughter from a previous marriage (Vanessa Lee Chester). Spielberg takes the stories in directions that are not as interesting as Jurassic Park went. The one terrifying scene comes via a cliché moment, with a van's windshield slowly cracking under the weight of one of our heroes. The true story of The Lost World involves another party of explorers, this time funded by Hammond's old company who wants to revive Jurassic Park, this time in San Diego. This subplot ushers in one of the silliest, non-needed series of events to happen in the long career of Steven Spielberg.

173,MF210,Underrated,8,19 October 2003,"My Rating: *** out of ****. I dont understand all the horrible reviews for this film. Sure not a great film, but definitely a good, entertaining movie. I enjoyed it just as much as the first Jurassic Park. The Lost World still contains impressive, eye popping effects. These are just as flawless as the CGI as the first Jurassic Parks. There are more dinosaurs and they all look great. The film contains more action than the first and its all exciting. One scene that stands out is the scene with the Raptors in the fields. I love the way Spielberg shot it.
This is not a big acting movie, but its not that bad. Jeff Goldblum is good as Ian Malcolm, but had a little more energy in the first one. Julianne Moore is adequate but looks a bit uncomfortable at times. Vanessa Lee Chester is better than the other kids in the last film. The rest of the acting is adequate. Many people thought this film was redundant of the first. I wouldnt call it redundant but it is a little bit too familiar in areas.  The Lost World takes place in a different area but it is not much different from the first one. However, it is an entertaining movie. The action overshadows the story.
The big problem I have with The Lost World is the ending. It doesnt make sense how The T-Rex got loose. Its also a King Kong Rip-Off. Its visually stunning looking, the TREX doesnt look out of place at all. But it was showing CGI instead of doing something with the story. Nevertheless, even with its flaws The Lost World is entertaining and not worthy of its horrible reviews.",The Lost World - Jurassic Park
174,vailsy,a silly sequel devoid of suspense,4,20 November 2005,"even though the subject matter of the first movie was fantastical, what made it so intriguing was the possibility that with genetic advances.. maybe this might be feasible in the future the first movie also treated the dinosaurs with some respect even acknowledging that some breeds of dinosaur may have been able to think and work as teamson the island in this movie, the raptors must have bred themselves dumb. at one point, one of them even gets a kick in the face from an 8 year old gymnast. utterly ridiculous in the first movie dinosaurs are dangerous, once you go beyond the fences you're likely to get munched at any moment. in this film people wander around, shouting at each other seemingly in safe surroundings that they can control the movie tries to continue in the same style as the first, but with the new environment the whole story just comes crashing down like a sack of mouldy old spuds coming to a fantastic crappy crescendo",The Lost World - Jurassic Park

176,NerdBat,Slightly Disappointing,4,4 September 2018,"As many have said, this film will never give the original any justice. The bringing of the Tyrannosaurus to the city is a clear renewal of the 1920's silent film, ""The Lost World"". It was based on the original Sir Arthur Conan Doyle book of the same name, which involves a live brontosaurus being brought to London, and inevitably escapes to wreak havoc. This film is a good example of the STUPIDITY of mankind. Oh, sure, lets bring a loud, injured young Tyrannosaurus right into our camp, that won't lead to trouble at all, no way! We're scientists. Not to mention the whole bus hanging from the cliff scene went on for waaaaay too long. It was as if a good quarter of the movie was the team hanging on a rope over the side of a cliff and trying not to fall to their deaths. Climb the stupid rope or don't.

180,caseynicholson,A Huge Disappointment,4,5 June 2015,"Item #2 on my watch list before ""Jurassic World"" hits theaters was ""The Lost World"". I explained in my review for the original ""Jurassic Park"" that this is my first time seeing the trilogy, having missed them when I was in high school and then college. Having finally sat down to watch them, I enjoyed the first film just fine and gave it eight stars, so I was hopeful that ""The Lost World"" would keep up the trend.Unfortunately, it was a huge disappointment. The story is a bit weak, and it leaves one wondering if this film was thrown together purely for the money that a sequel would make after the success of the original film. The acting is on par with the first movie, but the style becomes a fair bit more gory with blood and violent death scenes being fairly gratuitous throughout the film. It's not on par with an 80's slasher movie, but there's certainly a more grotesque use of imagery in this film.The main thing that I disliked about the film is its ending. Without spoiling the movie, the last half an hour or so sees a shift in scenes that is very strange when compared to the first movie, and it's a weird plot twist that just doesn't work with the film. Throw in the fact that I was ready for the movie to be finished before that last thirty minutes was ever tacked on, and the whole thing just winds up being a tedious affair. Between the blood, the weak story, and the awkward ending, I just don't feel good about rating this movie higher than a four. I suppose I might be talked into giving it five stars, but no sooner than I say that I realize that a five would be a neutral rating, and this frankly deserves to be labeled as a bad movie, so four it is.

182,C22Man,Oh What Could Have Been,4,6 June 2016,"You will struggle to find a film that is more synonymous with what could have been than The Lost World. The original Jurassic Park was a massive success which prompted Michael Crichton to write a sequel (even if little of the novel is used here). Spielberg was back on board, much of the same technical team was back and a host of talented actors filled the cast. Even with all of that the film is nowhere near as good as it should have been, yet it's not the disaster many make it out to be. The film looks too good, the music too immersive and the supporting cast too solid for it to be a failure. It is simply too well made for that. Instead we're left with a film that happens to be a bizarre mixture, brilliant on a technical level but infuriating on a writing one.The biggest issue lies with the main characters. Jeff Goldblum as edgy mathematician Ian Malcolm was a fan favourite from the first film, so making him the lead makes sense from a logical point but it simply doesn't work. Malcolm was at his best commenting on the situation and interjecting pieces of humour, but once you have him as the main character you lose all of that. His edginess is awkward, his humour wears thin quick and he becomes irritating. Goldblum looks bored throughout and his habit of whispering important lines is maddening. Julianne Moore (who is usually solid) looks lost here, though it's hard to fault her as Sarah Harding is just a typically plucky scientist. I don't think Vince Vaughn is funny, but going by this film he needs to steer clear of anything resembling drama. The film actually managed to make me miss Sam Neill.I like the way in which the story builds and I also like the way all of the characters are involved. Even the idea for there to be a Site B fits the plot fine. Yet the more things move along, the more inflexible and confused the film seems to get. Characters do things that are downright foolish (Harding not getting rid of her shirt soaked with T-Rex blood) or events happen just so a dinosaur can go on a rampage. All taking place while Goldblum delivers some painful lines. I don't even want to begin to discuss Malcolm's daughter defeating a Velociraptor with a gymnast move, it really is that absurd. And yes Malcolm's daughter Kelly sneaks on to the island, playing a mildly important role. Luckily she isn't needlessly taking over scenes and as a result doesn't become as annoying as her father.The dinosaurs look just as good as before, impressive considering we see much more of them than we did in the original film. The blend of the humans and dinosaurs is seamless, with the hunting scene presenting this the best. Seeing the hunters tussling with the dinosaurs just looks wonderful, holding up perfectly. The lead hunter Roland Tembo is played by Pete Postlethwaite in what is superb casting. Postlethwaite is the type of actor who could make the phonebook sound interesting and he's gripping every time he's on screen. Similarly is Arliss Howard as the slimy businessman Ludlow who is the closest thing to a villain. In a very different role than we're used to seeing him in, Howard manages to make a person you enjoy hating. John Williams' score carries the same feel as the original film and fits the scenery well. His sound fits Spielberg's work so well that by this point it would just feel wrong to not have his music here.There were countless images that impressed me from a visual viewpoint. There are plenty of uses of blue filter and silhouette throughout that really add atmosphere to the film, whilst Spielberg's use of spotlights continues in the same vein. The action sequences are very elaborate both in scope and scale. Yet you do have to question the 'point' of this action however. Both the trailer hanging off the side of the cliff and the T-Rex's climatic rampage through San Diego are visually impressive as well as entertaining, but they don't lead to anything or add to the characters. It is like they're there simply because an action sequence was needed and that doesn't fit this type of film. The editing is troublesome too. Certain scenes will end too quickly or before anything was properly developed. The slow zoom doesn't create tension if it's not used right. I agree that the film is darker than the original, but I certainly would have enjoyed it to go further and cut out some of the sillier moments.Once we get our coda in San Diego the film ends on something of a jovial note. I cannot deny that it is a frequently entertaining film, but it is also one that is unsatisfying because you know that something really good could have come out of this. It almost feels like for every step forward the film made, it took one back. I'm not sure what the answer would have been. Certainly having Ian Malcolm (with an irritating Goldblum) lead was a terrible decision, but the potential was still here in for something special and the pieces were in place even if the right script wasn't. You can kind of tell Spielberg's heart wasn't fully in this one and that he probably did it because of the demand, the majority of his technical expertise is on display but the film lacks the heart and energy that we are used to seeing him deliver.",The Lost World - Jurassic Park

184,paul_3-960-896774,When started to go awry,7,24 June 2015,"The Lost World: Jurassic Park is probably still my favorite out of the Jurassic Park film series. It's far from perfect but it's still nerve-racking. Back in the day it stressed me out to watch the poor choices these people were making. It would have been completely unbearable to watch if it wasn't for Ian Malcolm (Jeff Goldblum). He was and still is the only one that kind of make sense, his cynicism, common sense, and sarcasm contributed to stop this movie becoming a total train-wreck. He was the character the audience could relate to and also the comic relief of the film. I will admit that sometimes he was borderline annoying but he was saying what we were all thinking watching the film.Unlike the first one it doesn't rely so much on our fear of the unseen. We see a lot of the dinosaurs, they are no longer lurking in bushes off-camera, they are front and center. The special effects looks good but we might have seen too much of them. They could have left a few things to the imagination, it would have been much scarier that way.This sequel, like many, is riddled with flaws, and I'm only going to name a few. The tiny dinosaurs - the compsognathuses -, they started out strong in the amazing opening scene but then *spoilers* their victim survived so how the F*** can they later on kill a full grown man that fast? To this day it pisses me off, she should have died. It wouldn't have been pretty but it would have made me take them seriously.The Lost World: Jurassic Park flaws are big but easy to overlook because the film is entertaining.

185,enochsneed,Spielberg shows contempt for his audience,1,20 October 2009,"That's the only assumption I can make from this terrible sequel to an exciting original (albeit one that was dumbed down from its source novel).I wish I could have listened in to the story conferences for this piece of schlock: ""I've got it! There's another island nobody knows about because all the architects and engineers and scientists and the accountants who kept InGen's books have been sworn to secrecy"" ""Yeah! But this time they want to keep it safe"" ""Yeah! But then there are these bad guys who still want to exploit the dinosaurs"" ""Yeah! But then it all goes wrong and they get eaten"" ""Yeah! But then they get one and bring it home"" etc...Spielberg badly overplays his tried-and-true nerve janglers here. In ""Jaws"" we had the dismembered head in the boat, in ""Jurassic Park"" it was the detached arm, here we have a hand clutching a ship's wheel (what ate the crew by the way, and what happened to it? Surely the T-Rex didn't just have a quick snack and head back to the hold?). We see water discoloured by blood more than once. I felt Spielberg was saying ""You know what? I made 'Schindler's List', but you guys just want more of this stuff. OK, to hell with you, here it is and good luck!"" By the time the T-Rex was charging through San Diego I felt I was back in the days of ""Beast from 20,000 Fathoms"". Away from the primeval atmosphere of the tropics the film lost any suspense it might have had.To give credit where I feel it is due, Arliss Howard's accent had me laughing out loud whenever he spoke: is it just me or did he sound very like a certain heir to the throne of England?",The Lost World - Jurassic Park
186,TheMovieDoctorful,The Empire Strikes Back of the Jurassic Park Franchise,10,30 January 2019,"Here's a bold claim; The Lost World: Jurassic Park is to the original Jurassic Park what The Empire Strikes Back was to A New Hope. While the original Jurassic Park is undeniably a masterpiece, the film's comparatively light hearted and wondrous tone compared to its darker, more adult source material never quite sat right with me. Spielberg puts childish things away with The Lost World, which can be seen as a commentary on emotions overpowering reason, on the dangers of romanticizing nature, even on the cynicism of the act of creation itself (A theme that could almost be argued to be autobiographical on Spielberg's part.)Nobody is safe from egregious harm or even death in The Lost World. While the victims of Jurassic Park were either mercifully killed off screen or irredeemable and one note caricatures (Not that there was anything wrong with that, given the whimsical tone of the film) who existed to die, The Lost World removes the plot armor that protected the more benevolent characters of the original. An innocent, wide eyed child finds her naive curiosity rewarded with vicious mutilation, the charitable and proactively heroic Eddie Carr gets torn to pieces as reward for saving his friends in a backbreaking ordeal. Spielberg critiques our enchantment of his world, the fantastical notion of a tame and obedient nature that exists solely for our entertainment. We see this in our villains, but also in our heroes as well, who come to a dangerous and hostile environment clearly unprepared on the absurd assumption that this environment will welcome them with open arms based solely on their good intentions. Malcolm's monologue about nature's inability to be contained and discovery being a violent, destructive act holds more poignancy and meaning here than it ever did in the original Jurassic Park.Going off of that, it's quite interesting how nearly every character in the film seems to have their own murky and misguided excuse for their actions being respectful of the natural world. Roland Trembo, a prolific game hunter, justifies his actions with an imagined sense of honor (""A real hunter doesn't mind if the animal wins."") Nick Van Owen pretends to care for the rights of the animals on the island, but even admits earlier in the film that Hammond paid him considerably to sabotage InGen's plans and he only took jobs with Green Peace for the affections of their female members. Even Peter Ludlow justifies his actions under the pretense of Isla Sorna's dinosaurs being creatures of artificiality rather than nature (""An extinct animal brought back to life has no rights. It exists because we made it. We patented it. We own it."") In an age where environmentalism was becoming increasingly trendy, Spielberg has crafted a brilliant critique of those quick to label themselves ""ecofeminists"" or ""environmentalists"" out of desire to join a fad rather than any strong set of values.That's not to say that the misguided characters here aren't likable as they absolutely are. Ian Malcolm is much more remorseful, human and humble in The Lost World than he was in the original Jurassic Park, jaded and cynical, but far more self aware, compassionate, proactive and concerned than he was in the first film. Malcolm can almost be seen as an allegory for the film itself (Right down to his decreased popularity) in his newfound sense of moral responsibility. His journey of redemption in the eyes of his loved ones, both his ex-girlfriend Sarah and his daughter Kelly, was truly captivating and really gave the character a soul and relatability he never quite had before. Jeff Goldblum's performance in the role is outstanding, going to a much more serious and dark place than he usually does, while still retaining his golden sense of wit and humor (The memorable and endlessly quotable dialogue is another wonderful aspect of the film.)Vanessa Lee Chester's performance as Kelly Curtis is easily my favorite performance by a child actor in the entire franchise. Her Kelly Curtis is sweet, strong, intelligent and refreshingly stubborn and unlike the other child actors of the franchise, there isn't a single scene-breaking moment where she comes off as overly kiddish or not taking the role seriously, despite how adorable she is. Her arc of acceptance for her negligent father certainly has more heart than those of any other child character in the franchise, past or future. It's also worth mentioning that she has some excellent chemistry with Jeff Goldblum and it's truly impressive how effortlessly she's able to match her comedic timing. It's a crime she didn't have a bigger career after this.The visuals are spellbinding in every way. The animatronics and CGI blend perfectly to create dinosaurs with a tremendous sense of power, beauty and awe. There isn't a single moment in the film where they don't feel totally and completely real and glorious. The sets are also deserving of serious praise; the forests of Prairie Creek Redwoods State Park feel jaw-droppingly primordial, like a natural time capsule 65 million years old. If the almost otherworldly dinosaurs of Jurassic Park would fit in anywhere, it would be here. Spielberg's direction here is also among the best of his career, taking an almost Horror-esque vibe to it as he plays up the terror and menace of these creatures on their home field. Scenes such as the Velociraptor attack in the cornfield or the T-Rex intrusion of Sarah and Kelly's tent hold an incredible amount of suspense and dread, even moreso than the car scene from the original Jurassic Park.The Lost World: Jurassic Park is a masterpiece, the best Jurassic Park film to date and it boggles my mind as ti how it's been so misunderstood and dismissed, if not outright hated, over the years. I'm glad to call myself among its loyal fanbase as the film has so much to offer. This is Platinum Tier Spielberg.",The Lost World - Jurassic Park

189,jaredpahl,"Supremely Thrilling, Suspenseful, and Visually Breathtaking, The Lost World is a Summer Blockbuster Sequel Done Right",9,29 August 2015,"The Lost World: Jurassic Park, the sequel to Steven Spielberg's iconic blockbuster, was released to massive commercial success, but critical disappointment. While audiences flocked to see the follow-up to the highest grossing movie of all-time, critics lambasted the movie for failing to live up to the high mark set by its groundbreaking predecessor. I'm here to set the record straight. The critics were demonstrably wrong. The Lost World is one of the most underrated, and over-hated movies of recent memory. Four years after Jurassic Park captivated audiences around the world, Steven Spielberg returned to the director's chair to craft a sequel that matched the original in every area that mattered. The Lost World is as technically accomplished, as thrilling, and as exquisitely crafted as the highly praised, Jurassic Park. Critics be damned!Michael Crichton's sequel novel serves as inspiration for The Lost World's story, which introduces Isla Sorna, or Site B, as its main setting. This island is the site where Jurassic Park's dinosaurs were bred and raised. After the events of Jurassic Park, the site was abandoned and dinosaurs roam free once again, in a proverbial ""lost world"". Ian Malcolm, the neurotic chaotician from the first film, is the centerpiece figure of The Lost World, substituting for Sam Neil's Alan Grant, who was left out of Crichton's book. Malcolm's girlfriend, Sarah Harding (Julianne Moore) and her team of biologists are sent to Isla Sorna to study the unique animals on the island. Meanwhile, InGen's team, led by great white hunter Roland Tembo, played with scene-stealing gusto by the late, great Pete Postlethwaite, come to capture some of the island's larger inhabitants. Ian Malcolm learns of this news and takes it upon himself to retrieve his girlfriend from the dinosaur-infested island. The Lost World doesn't bother much with exposition (After the pieces are put in place, it's non-stop dino-action), but David Koepp's script is not simple-minded. Here is a story that, in its own way, still develops its characters and encourages engagement. There are ideas present in The Lost World (on greed, nature, human hubris), which is more than you can say about its successors.One of the criticisms The Lost World often receives is that it lacks the compelling characters of the first film. It's a complaint that holds no water. Moore's wide-eyed, overly enthusiastic Dr. Harding, Vince Vaughn's militant eco-activist, Nick Van Owen, the aforementioned big game hunter, Tembo, and the rest of the new characters are, in the most basic sense, well drawn. What they lack in situational awareness (haters will have you know that there are dumb decisions made by some), they make up for in personality. Love them or hate them, these are real characters. People, with passions and flaws. Not the fleshy placeholders of JP3 and Jurassic World. And that's not to mention Jeff Goldblum, who carries the protagonist load admirably. When you think about it, his role here is not only different from the first film, but different from most anything Goldblum has done. We know he can do quirky, but his understated cynicism here comes off totally natural all the way through. Malcolm is the ultimate grounding force among all the dinosaur chaos; a huge asset to the movie.The cogent story and memorable characters, as welcome as they are, are only the icing on this cake. The essence of The Lost World is its fantastic dinosaur action. Here is where this movie outclasses nearly all its competitors. The Lost World is Steven Spielberg flexing his cinematic muscles. He takes the set pieces, a trailer dangling off a cliff, a basecamp ambush by territorial T-Rexes, or a raptor hunt in long grass, and weaves from them some real tension, suspense, and above all, thrills. Spielberg knows how to tease an action scene and have it explode to life at just the right time. Even when things move to San Diego in the final act, the richness of Spielberg's action remains. His sense for visual iconography, like glass slowly cracking, shadows streaking across tents, and trails being made in grass, is unparalleled. We've grown used to modern action that numbs the senses, but the satisfaction of Spielberg's action is that it enriches them. At this point, he's just showing off.But what is dinosaur action without the dinos themselves? If Jurassic Park redefined creature effects for the modern age, The Lost World perfected them. Combining the very best of both animatronics and digital effects, Stan Winston and ILM create dinosaurs even more dazzling than those in Jurassic Park. The intricately detailed large scale animatronics move smoothly with a wide range of motion, and the CGI is as photo real as anything in 1997, or today for that matter, but what separates these dinosaurs from other movie monsters is the way they are treated as characters. The dinosaurs of the Lost World: Jurassic Park are written and directed with a constant eye for realism. The T-Rex parents, the biggest stars of the film, don't chase and eat people just because they are T-Rexes. When they attack, we know why. They exhibit maternal instincts when their baby is taken from them and territorial instincts when the scientists venture too far into their domain (As do the stegosauruses, in a fabulous early scene). It is a credit to writer David Koepp that a film that could have easily devolved into mindless action maintains a certain level of intelligence, even in its most fantastic moments. And we aren't just told that the dinosaurs are ""animals, not monsters"". They actually behave that way. The T-Rexes sniff the air for signs of their baby, the raptors snap at each other during a hunt, the compys swarm a piece of food dropped on the beach; These moments feel like they were taken from a documentary. Of course this is how dinosaurs would behave. They are given reasons to roar and chase, when the lazy thing to do would be to create dinosaurs that exist only to look cool.Okay, so the story may not be as fresh as the original Jurassic Park, I can buy that, but The Lost World matches the first movie in nearly every other way. The special effects, action, score, set design, cinematography, you name it, they all carry the same mark of quality as the original Jurassic Park. There is passion behind the creation of The Lost World: Jurassic Park. A novel from Michael Crichton, Steven Spielberg at the helm, ILM and Stan Winston at the top of their respective games, and John Williams providing the music; This is the only Jurassic Park sequel that can stand with the original. It does exactly what a big budget sequel should do. It skips through the requisite set-up and launches full force into the thrills. The Lost World is jam-packed with jaw-dropping special effects and pulse-pounding action, yet it stays smart enough and scary enough to feel fulfilling. It's the very best kind of summer popcorn entertainment, and without question the best sequel to Jurassic Park.89/100",The Lost World - Jurassic Park
190,cbnewham,They may have got the dinosaurs to,4,9 July 2020,"Look and act correctly.A shame they didn't get the humans to act correctly. I know one has to have a certain level of suspension of disbelief, but this movie requires you to empty your brain.There is no way in the world many of the decisions and actions that take place in this movie would happen in real life. People in danger do not stop to have conversations. They don't stop to look at posters. Knowing they are being hunted, they don't go through doors and leave them wide open, or stand in the middle of a cabin and have a conversation having dispatched only one of several animals they know are chasing them. They don't hold automatic weapons and run away without even attempting to use them. They don't listen to music when they know there's a dangerous situation and they need to be alert. And they don't sabotage weapons, knowing full well they are in mortal danger and those weapons may be needed, regardless of their political beliefs.Jeff Goldblum carries most of the movie. The rest were a bit meh. As for the girl - why bother to have her in at all. She added nothing to the story other than raising the question (actually asked by a character in the movie and not explained) about who exactly her parents were. I suppose they at least didn't have Sam Neill in it - a man who can't act his way out of a paper bag.I've recently watched all of the JP movies (some for the first time, like this one) and this is clearly the weakest by a country mile.Four stars for the dinosaurs and Jeff Goldblum.",The Lost World - Jurassic Park
191,domtaylor,Much worse than the first.,5,10 July 2018,"Making a follow-up to a masterpiece is no small feat, but who better to make a sequel to Spielberg's best film than Spielberg himself? Well, probably nobody but that just shows what a hard task this must have been. 'The Lost World: Jurassic Park' is nowhere near as as good as the original. It's not even close. Spielberg's touches are evident in the film, however, and thankfully that means we get a few good sequences (such as the RV scene) that are genuinely tense, exciting and well-crafted. Unfortunately though, these sequences are few and far between, undermined by a seriously silly storyline and screenplay that make this film feel like a parody of the first. Having characters that use gymnastics to fight dinosaurs and ones that would rather accompany the same space as a T-Rex than a snake really highlight the shortcomings of the screenplay. Even Jeff Goldblum can't save this, mainly because the 'Ian Malcolm' in this film is completely different from that in the last. At least the visual effects are up to scratch again (except from the obvious control blatantly seen on one of the animatronic dinosaurs' legs) and the soundtrack by John Williams is good, without being a copy of the first films'. Overall, 'The Lost World: Jurassic Park' is a massive let-down that, apart from everything else, is actually quite boring. 'Jurassic Park' is Spielberg's best film. 'The Lost World: Jurassic Park' is one of his worst. 5/10.",The Lost World - Jurassic Park

It follows most of the rules for a successful sequel, i.e. more action, more dinos, etc.  The sequel could not possibly capture the awe of the original so they correctly flooded us with dazzling effects.  Sure the storyline is weak, but there was not much more they could have done as far as the overall plot line.  The worst part of this movie is clearly the presence of Malcolm's annoying daughter.  Forget that a movie about genetically engineered dinosaurs fails to account for the racial discrepancy between father and daughter, whenever the Kelly character is on screen bad things happen, culminating with her gymnastic routine where her 80 lb body drives a 600 lb velociraptor out the window like a cannon.

198,moviemattb,"It's not as good as the first, but it doesn't deserve the hate",8,14 June 2015,"After the first one being a huge success, a sequel was made and everyone hates it. Does it deserve the hate? No. Here is why: the story is about Ian Malcolm one of the survivors of the first one goes out to find his girlfriend Sarah Harding on a different island that is filled with none other than dinosaurs. However, more expeditions come in as they are about to take dinosaurs off this island for another theme park attractions. Malcolm and the others need to stop them and each group of their own gets stuck on an island as they try to work together on how to get home. The main reason why no one likes this movie is because of two things: First, it doesn't have the same charm as the first which is true, and second they really hated on what the characters are doing like opening cages as dinosaurs destroy their camp or bringing in a baby T-Rex into an RV. I know everyone is entitled to their opinion, but I think everyone is misjudging it. I know its not as good as the first one, but I really enjoyed how it stands out on its own where it doesn't need to be like the first one. The characters to me are just like any other movie you see as once they are into risky situations, they just argue things over and are just having a hard time trusting each other and working together. I can defend their actions if I have to write this as a long review, but don't want to go too far on that. I thought Jeff Goldblum, in my opinion, plays a very good lead as in the first one he was once a funny side character, now he is more mature and he has once had his experience on Isla Nublar as he had to risks his life again on Isla Sorna to go out and find Sarah, and then come home. The other cast all did fine. Even though, there is not much to their character, but I would love if the movie has some more characterization. The story I thought was told fine as once again not being like the first one again. The special effects, well, at times there are parts that are slightly dated, but for the most part they looked really good. John Williams' music is just as good as he did with the music in the first one. I do love the final scene, where the T- Rex attacks San Diego which I thought was a well done action scene. Like the first one, the movie doesn't bored me as it still keeps my interest. ""The Lost World: Jurassic Park"" may not be a perfect movie, but I don't think its really Steven Spielberg's fault, I thought he did well enough on what he can bring to this movie that does give enough much excitements, and plenty of good dinosaur action. To me, I say give this movie another chance. If not, then no worries because everyone has an opinion and we respect it to each of our own.

As defined by critic Roger Ebert, an ""Idiot Plot"" movie is one that has ""..a plot that requires all the characters to be idiots. If they weren't, they'd immediately figure out everything and the movie would be over."" Oh, where to start with the inanities this movie's characters commits? From the beginning, I suppose:1. Industrialist Hammond (Richard Attenborough) recruits the decidedly cynical intellectual Ian Malcolm (Jeff Goldblum) to keep tabs on occasional scientist/girlfriend (Juliette Moore) as she investigates the breeding dinosaur colony on Site B island. Wouldn't more physically adventurous and pragmatic Alan Grant (Sam O'Neill) be a more logical choice?2. Moore's scientist is supposed to study the dinosaurs unobtrusively. So why does she bring a laboratory trailer the size of a boxcar with which to crash through the jungle?3. Moore's scientist startles an infant stegosaurus with a noisy flash camera and nearly gets decapitated by an infuriated adult's spiked tail.4. Ian's high-maintenance brat daughter Vanessa stows away on the trip to Site B and jeopardizes Ian's safety by wanting to go into the ""high hide"" (a suspended cage) when two tyrannosaurs decide to visit the lab trailer.5. The two tyrannosaurs decide to visit the lab trailer because solicitous photographer (Vince Vaughn) brings their injured infant for Moore's scientist to set its fractured leg. As a reward for their benevolent humanitarianism, the lab trailer is hurled off a cliff, with Ian, Moore's character, and Vaughn's character nearly following suit.6. Ian and company free the dinosaurs that were captured in the round-up conducted by InGen's mercenaries for transport to a San Diego zoo. As a reward for their benevolent humanitarianism, the animals stampede and destroy all communication with the outside world, forcing the two enemies to join forces to travel to the interior towards an abandoned radar post.7. An InGen mercenary strays from the group into unknown wilderness to urinate. A herd of tiny Compsognathus fatally mutilate him. Another mercenary would have heard him, if not for his MP3 headphones.8. For some inexplicable reason, Moore's scientist takes a blood-soaked denim jacket and hangs it within her tent, allowing one of the tyrannosaurs to track and nearly slaughter all the group.9. Supposedly wilderness-experienced mercenaries allow themselves to be picked off by the original villains in Jurassic Park in tall grass.10. Why wasn't the captured tyrannosaurus properly tranquilized on the abortive trip to San Diego? Moore's scientist mumbles something about not being able to calibrate the dosage properly. However, when the tyrannosaur is corralled back into the ship, Moore's scientist fires a tranquilizer dart. Why didn't she do that earlier and prevent the rampage?11. The tyrannosaur visits a house with a swimming pool to satisfy its thirst. The family inside takes a picture of him with another noisy flash camera right in the eyes. The tyrannosaur roars (and presumably kills the family).12. Hammond's villainous nephew steals the infant brought to lure the tyrannosaur back and brings it to the ship. The tyrannosaur traps him there, cripples him, and lets the infant practice his killing skills.13. Towards the end of the movie, Hammond mentions that the Site B dinosaurs ""require our absence"" in order to flourish. Now he tells us!Despite this cavalcade of stupidity, I have a grudging affection for TLW and even own it on VHS.

201,mitchell5954,One of the Most Underappreciated Sequels Ever,8,11 January 2019,"The Lost World is a movie I feel is largely underrated by many people including myself initially. When I first saw this movie as a kid I disliked it. I found it quite boring until the 3rd act in San Diego. I've watched the film a few times in my later years and still held to that mindset. I'm 22 now. Upon watching this film several times recently I strangely found myself really enjoying it and changing my opinion on it. This movie got much better with age and now I think it is a great film while still inferior to Jurassic Park. However, there are still some issues with the film that can't go unmentioned.The story is quite different from the first film. Four years after Jurassic Park Hammond reveals to Malcom (Jeff Goldblum) of a second island called Site B where more dinosaurs roam free in the wild. Hammond's cousin named Peter has taken control of his company, Ingen, from him and is planning to take the dinosaurs off the island and put them in a zoo. Malcolm and a team of others including his girlfriend Sarah (Julianne Moore) and daughter Kelly must go to the island to observe the dinosaurs in secret and stop Peter. However, things go awry very quickly and it becomes a battle for survival like the first film.The effects and overall look of the film is still breathtaking like the first film. It looks every bit as good as Jurassic Park despite some people saying otherwise. John Williams also delivers another amazing score that is extremely catchy especially the main theme. It's not as iconic as the first film but good in its own right.The cast is pretty good. Granted the cast isn't as memorable as the first film but I still like them fine. Some are a little bland but enjoyable and there wasn't anybody I inherently disliked. The best character is definitely Malcom who returns from the first film but is a fairy different person which is no surprise considering what happened to him in the park. When I first saw this film one of my complaints was how vastly different Malcom was and how brooding he was throughout the entire thing. However, when looking back it was a logical progression and he does still make some jokes here and there. I did find myself missing Dr. Grant who is my favorite character in the first and third movies but that's a nitpick.Many people complain that this is too different from the first film and that it didn't capture the magic of it. First of all, a sequel is supposed to be different from its predecessor and go in a slightly different direction which this movie did. Secondly, the magic of the first film can never be completely duplicated. Jurassic Park was the first of its kind to feature such lifelike depictions of dinosaurs on screen. However, now that it has been done the bar has been raised to such a high degree that nothing can hope to reach it. The Avengers has a very similar problem today. I think The Lost World comes as close as it can to recapturing the magic while not retreading the same waters.However, there are things wrong with this film as well. There are a couple cheesy action bits like when Kelly kicks a raptor out a window with her gymnastics background. There are also scenes that don't make any sense like a scene in San Diego in the 3rd act where the ship carrying the T-Rex crashes into the doc and the entire crew had been eaten by something. We never find out what ate the crew. It's never addressed.Also, there's this really boring and drawn-out scene in which one characters is stocked in the woods and eventually killed by these smaller dinosaurs that I can't remember the names to. It was supposed to be a nod to a death scene in the Jurassic Park novel I guess. This scene drags out for almost ten minutes or, at least, it felt like it. It'd be one thing if it was a major character but it's this stock bully character we don't care about. He only had like three scenes before that point.There is also this hunter named Roland who is probably my second favorite character in the film. I wish we got to learn more about him but we really don't. There's a deleted scene where he's approached to head the expedition by Ingen which they should've left in.Overall, Lost World is an underrated gem that deserves a second chance. It's not as magical as the first film but it really is impossible to be. Jurassic Park was lightning in a bottle in that it was the first of its kind. Even if the effects in future films are as good if not better and has the same feel it would still not fully recapture the first film. For those who don't like it please give it another look. For those who haven't seen it in a good while you might be surprised if you keep a more open mind.",The Lost World - Jurassic Park

There are some films I feel like that where it is done well like ""Aliens"" or ""Platoon"", but ""The Lost World"" does not do this.

While John Hammond (Richard Attenborough) was like this in the first film, he was not a stereotype, let alone an antagonist. The only thing done right is that he is the opposite of Hammond, being in it for the money while Hammond was in it just to bring something new to people.With the main antagonist comes the problem with the main character, Ian Malcolm. I have no problem with Jeff Goldblum and I loved the character in both the novelizations of ""Jurassic Park"" and ""The Lost World"" and the first film. This is still the case with this movie but I do not think that Malcolm is a good main character. In the first movie, he was more of a foil character to oppose Hammond instead of someone who was main character material. Also, he still seems to be the designated guy who brings the comic relief. While I was okay with that in the first film, he should not of been like that this much when he was a main character. There were a lot of things I liked, though, as well. The characters are still somewhat interesting as opposed to the blank slates they are in ""Jurassic Park III"". Plus, the dinosaurs are fleshed out a little as shown being caring parents and not just giant monsters. Along with the fleshing out of the dinosaurs, there is another aspect of the film that I like involving the dinosaurs. The herbivores are dangerous, like they would be in real life which is glossed over in the first and second film. Stegosaurus attack Sarah, a Pachycephalosaurus attacks the mercenaries cars, and the herbivores trash the mercenaries camp. Yes, it is more of a dinosaur attack film but it does show us more of how the animals really would be and not the simple herbivores are nice and safe while the carnivores are mean and dangerous like the other two films do.Taking the pros with the cons, I liked this film and found that it was a good addition to the ""Jurassic Park"" trilogy. The effects were good, the story was interesting, and the action was superb and tense. While there are some pretty big flaws with the characters, they do not hurt the film a lot.",The Lost World - Jurassic Park
204,joseesrocha,spectacular film,10,25 June 2020,"JURASSIC PARK LOST WORLD is a spectacular film, the visual effects are stunning, the film in my opinion has the best soundtrack in the franchise, has new dinosaurs and has spectacular action scenes with suspense like the first film. I advise everyone to watch it.",The Lost World - Jurassic Park
205,cutter-12,Horrendously lame,3,6 February 2000,"Steven Spielberg directed this pointless and half-hearted screenplay? Astonishing. Derivative from the get go this film is a structureless, plot less and meaningless regurgitation of tired old Hollywood dinosaur and monsters on the loose movies and the pacing and suspense here is just dreadful. How much more can you do to showcase Dinosaurs in the wake of the first film, which at the time had a thin story but after this seems like it should have won best screenplay of the year. There was a scientific and ethical point the first film was making but here there is nothing more than mindless action sequences strung together with little cohesion and no attention paid to characterization. In ""Jurassic Park"" we at least came to know the characters enough to care for them for the duration of the piece. Ironic that the most annoying and noxious character in that film played by Jeff Golblum is the only holdover and goes on to provein ""The Lost World"" that he was completely unnecessary in ""Jurassic Park"". The screen writing here is at fault and the writers fail at every turn to deliver a logical continuation of the Jurassic Park story. The onus on a second island is completely ill-thought and absolutely unneeded following the scene in Jurassic Park where Wayne Knight loses the shaving cream can containing the dino DNA he was trying to smuggle out before being eaten alive in his jeep. Couldn't and shouldn't that have been the basis for the sequel? I could have written a half decent screenplay around that premise. The biggest and most surprising disappointment in this mess is Spielberg's involvement as director. Obviously after the titanic success of Jurassic park a sequel was always in the cards, but didn't Spielberg make demands on the screenplay? I can't believe he would accept this project without massive rewrites unless he was only fulfilling contractual agreements. With ""Amistad"" and ""Saving Private Ryan"" already on his plate at the time it's no small wonder that this picture is as flat and ridiculous as it is.A quasi-remake of the original ""The Lost World"" which is an unintelligible mess with poor acting and poor execution. After seeing how badly ""Congo"" was adapted for the screen, it's hard to comprehend Spielberg didn't think he was making a bad picture. He was due an outright lemon in his career and this one is it.",The Lost World - Jurassic Park
206,smashattack,Complete madness! What a disaster! (Major Spoilers),6,8 December 2001,"What happened here? Let's take a little review, people. The Lost World (novel) began with a man named Levine who took a trip with Diego to Isla Sorna. Diego is killed, Levine is trapped on the island, and Malcom and a group of people go to rescue him (and maybe do a little studying while they're at it). BioSyn sends out their best (Dodgson, King, and Baselton) to get eggs from the nests of various animals. Malcolm explains in depth more on Chaos Theory and other known phenomena, people get eaten. Not too different from the first one, yet it sustained its own storyline and turned out to be an excellent book (like all of Crichton's sci-fi thrillers). Now let's look at the movie. The Lost World (movie) began with a little girl on a beach who is attacked by a herd of Procomsognathuses. We never see her again, but I guess taking this scene from Jurassic Park the book and putting it into The Lost World the movie makes it all right. Then, we find Ian Malcolm who has ""been summoned"" by Hammond (who, by the way, should be dead). He finds out about Site B, Isla Sorna, and also discovers his girlfriend is there. He takes the team for InGen and goes on a ""rescue mission"" (thus Hammond accomplishes his original goal). There, another team from InGen (Who is BioSyn? In fact, who is Dodgson, King, and Baselton?) arrives to take the animals back to San Diego, where the first Jurassic Park compound built by Hammond is (What??? When did Hammond make this???). Running, screaming, gory bloody death scenes. Then all of a sudden the T-Rex is in San Diego (he gets the chance to devour David Koepp, the screenwriter who plays as ""Unlucky B*****d"". Oh, well. He screwed up the book... maybe Crichton liked seeing him chomped) running around pointlessly. They get the T-Rex back to the island, happy joy joy. Hold on a moment, John Rooksby, you obviously have never read the book. If they made this movie ANYTHING like the book, then it would have been EXCELLENT. Spielberg and Koepp had no apparent reason to destroy such a remarkable tale as this. Maybe there was too much intelligent dialogue in the book, or there wasn't enough blood, or there wasn't enough death and murder. Give me a break. There is no need to see the most brave man be worthlessly ripped in half by two T-Rexes like a piece of ragged meat. There is no reason that fifteen to twenty people should have been eaten by raptors in the field when nothing like that happened in the book (actually, yes, King was killed in the field by raptors, but who's King?). There is no reason for the T-Rex to have been brought to the mainland (the results would have been much more disastrous, don't you think?). The ""comical"" witticisms don't make you laugh. They make you wonder just how stupid these people are. For instance, Malcolm, Harding, and some photography guy that Spielberg and Koepp threw in as a new character for no obvious reason are dangling from a rope over a cliffside under a huge trailer. Eddie Carr asks what they need. ""Rope,"" they say. ""And three double cheeseburgers with everything on them."" ""No onions on mine."" What the heck is up with that? And who is this Kelly girl? Where is Arby? Last I knew, Kelly was a student of Doc Thorne (but who is he?) and didn't even know Malcolm, much less is she his African-American daughter. Let's face it people. This movie got really screwed up somewhere, and it doesn't deserve to be called Crichton's work. If you want something with action and blood and death--fine, watch this. If you want something intellectually stimulating and action-packed at the same time (who could forget the moment Doc went out to that garage with the camouflage dinosaurs (wait, what are those?) hunting him?), then read the superior book. It's a good thing Jurassic Park 3 was made more like the first one. At least people were serious about the situation in those two movies, and not making corny jokes about the dead or dying people.",The Lost World - Jurassic Park
207,VinceGambini,Unwatchable,2,22 February 2019,"This sequel is simply boring and none of the characters are likable enough to care about. Not worth watching, not then, even less now, 22 years on.",The Lost World - Jurassic Park
208,thewillt08,A Worthy Sequel,6,28 April 2013,"Michael Crichton wrote a sequel to his bestselling book Jurassic Park with The Lost World Jurassic Park. Once again Crichton worked with Spielberg to put The Lost World on the big screen. Jeff Goldblum returns with a cast of interesting characters as he goes to a second island where the dinosaurs live free. There are no fences and you can only imagine what happens before you actually see it. I hate to compare the first to the second move but everybody knows I loved the first but not so much the second. Like Anaconda I lived it as a kid because the site of dinosaurs eating people was awesome, but now that I'm older I appreciate characters and relationships etc. What Jurassic Park had in story and characters lacked in The Lost World but The Lost World had the action and excitement that lacked in Jurassic Park. You may ask why Ian Malcolm would revisit the world of dinosaurs and the answer is quite simple. Hammond's company, InGen wants to go to the island and take an animal back to San Diego and put it in a zoo. Hammond sent Malcolm's girlfriend, who happens to be a paleontologist, to the island alone so Malcolm goes to rescue her. The characters and story could have been terrific. Eddie Carr was a great character, Vince Vaughn is in the movie and he gives a really good performance early in his career, and I especially loved the character of Roland. Roland is a hunter who is looking for the ultimate bounty. He is an important character that is underrated. His character could have been so much more and every time he was starting to be built up they cut to a dinosaur eating a smaller character. He was a character I wanted to know about. The movie should have focused on characters like him and the guy with the beard and long hair. He is a dinosaur genius and he has such little screen time. That is the huge flaw in the movie, it is focused too much on the dinosaurs eating people and not enough in the story and its characters. Ian Malcolm was one of the best characters in the 90s and in The Lost World he lost his edge. The snarky comments and brilliance he once had was nowhere to be seen. He had moments of brilliance but he was rewritten as a different character in a way. That was really the only thing that hurt the movie and made it worse than the original.Sequels aren't supposed to be better than the original but the actual dinosaurs and the action scenes were amazing. I could watch the trailer on the cliff scene with the T-Rex over and over again. The CGI and special effects put into the dinosaurs, along with the life size robots were astounding. What lacked in real character development was made up for in the work in the animals themselves. Each dinosaur had its scene to shine and there were a lot more different species. I love the stegosaurus and the Compys. They each had their scenes and some were better than the others but all great. The Compys were a big part of the first book and were not in the movie but I'm glad they found their way into the second one. They are real scavengers and make an impact in the movie.Spielberg and Crichton nail the raptors once again, possibly even better this time. It focused less on the intelligence and more on the ferocity of the animals this time. That could be better because if they focused on intelligence again it could be a little redundant. They appear a little late in the film but they really change it. They look a little different and I'm glad they weren't used simply for killing off all the extras. Then there is the final few scenes, and boy did they not disappoint. It was awesome but at the same time it kind of ruined the lore of Jurassic Park. A major part of the second island is that it is kept secret and nobody knows about it. Without spoiling the ending I'll just say the secret is out, and that's a shame.The book was a great read but after the first movie and how it played out, it only made sense that the book and movie were nothing alike. The really only similarity was the characters themselves and the animals in them. In my other reviews I mentioned the character Dogson and how hia character was ruined in the movies. In the second book he goes to the island and it wouldn't of made sense in this movie. There was only lost potential and another thing that hurt this movie. Overall, The Lost World Jurassic Park was one of my favorite movies when I was little. It still holds up today but still lacks in characters. The action and dinosaurs were fun to look at and were top notch for its time but it wasn't enough to be memorable. I went into this movie wanting more then what I got. I wish they sacrificed some of the action scenes for more character interactions, especially with Roland. There were few glimpses of brilliance but the lack of time spent on characters is the reason I give The Lost World Jurassic Park the WillyT Recommendation. It is a great movie that should be seen at least once. I can watch it every now and then but it isn't as memorable as I'd hoped. It is still a solid film and is a worthy sequel to the classic that was released a few years earlier.",The Lost World - Jurassic Park
209,drawlife,"More action, more scares, and more dinosaurs.",6,4 December 2014,"This was the first Jurassic Park film I saw in theaters, I was barely an infant when the first one was released, but I was old enough, and accompanied by my teenage aunt to see this film in theaters in the summer of 1997. As a child watching it, I remember being scared a terrified, clenching my butt-hole the whole time, and holding on to my aunts arm tightly. Because of that experience The Lost World: Jurassic Park holds a special place in my heart, as cheesy as that sounds. I know many might see this film as an inferior sequel, but for me personally, I get a kick out of it and still do, despite it being slightly mediocre. This time around there are more dinosaurs, more action, and even more scares. I thought that in this film, Spielberg does a more effective job at creating tension and suspense. Once again Spielberg effectively uses the dinosaurs in every scene they're in, not to mention they look even better. The scenes involving the Compsognathus left me scarred in my youth and it still sends shivers down my spine every time I re-watch this film. The Stegosaurus scene involving Julianne Moore's character Dr. Sarah Harding, doesn't quite capture the magic of the Brachiosaurus scene, but still tender. The Velociraptors are again effectively used for scares and are even more vicious. There are three T-Rexes this time in the film, two being parents of an infant and they are the stars in this film. There's an awesome sequence involving a T-Rex rampaging across San Diego. The film's weak point, as it was in the first film are the characters. This time around Dr. Ian Malcolm is a different man. Jeff Goldblum, although his performance is dry, but it works for his character. He isn't the same man he used to be since the first film so it was neat to see Malcolm become a different person. Aside from Malcolm getting most of the spotlight, the rest of the characters are flat, aside from showing off hints of their personalities. I enjoyed Vince Vaughn's Nick Van Owen, he was full of wisecracks. I also very much enjoyed Pete Postlethwaite as Roland Temdo the hunter and tracker, who was in a way similar to Bob Peck's role in the first film. Aside from them I didn't really care much for the other characters. I was annoyed with Julianne Moore's character, as with the main villain of the film Peter Ludlow, portrayed by Arliss Howard, who now took over Ingen from his uncle John Hammond. He now wants to capture some of the dinosaurs and bring them to a park built in San Diego, something John Hammond does not want. Vanessa Lee Chester also fills in the void for Lex and Tim. It felt like a rehash of the first film, despite her pretty cool moment with a Velociraptor in the film. It feels as though, while watching this film, the characters are a lot smarter than they appear to be. I mean why would they do what they're doing when they clearly know that everything they're doing is a bad idea. You can't help but wonder these thoughts while in viewing. Despite all this, every moment with the dinosaurs are golden. Even though we don't really care about some of the characters in the film, the stakes are higher and it's fun seeing them in peril, and it makes for an entertaining film. The action sequences are twice as exhilarating, one involving a trailer over the cliff will surely have you grip on to something. Not to mention John Williams's score this time around is more energetic and just as good as the first one. To sum it up this sequel is everything that you'd expect, more action, more dinosaurs, more thrills, and a higher body count. It's a fun ride throughout and provides more than the first film in terms of scale and stakes, but it's not completely refreshing as it's predecessor. 6/10",The Lost World - Jurassic Park

Those were brilliant. But, if I recall, Jaws 2 was not a brilliant film. But that's okay. Sequels hardly ever are. So you can go with tradition and add this to the good sequel list.Steve hardly ever can go with tradition: Shark films always stink, dinosaur films are always cheap. But, he can go with the tradition of sequels not being as good as the first. This movie continues after the first events of Jurassic Park. This time, the dinosaurs are on another island and a large group of people come to stop the dinosaurs from killing. Not going to happen.Jurassic Park was somehow brilliant and this film is somehow not. This movie is scarier, the body count is higher and the characters are still interesting. So, why is it not that brilliant and just pretty good? I don't know. It's just pretty good, not brilliant.So enjoy The Lost World. It's a good movie. It's very good for a sequel.

211,christophershobris,One of Spielberg's Weakest,4,9 June 2016,"I don't hate this movie, don't get me wrong. It still holds some of the magic that this franchise offers. But, I will admit, this wasn't Spielberg's best effort. He and sequels don't seem to get along very well, why? Wouldn't it seem he could make a good sequel if he does so well on the original? Well, he didn't. The choices he made for the film are strange. In the first film we are in a park for the vast majority of it. In this it's in a city? I like the gutsy choice, and the massive chance to use special effects, and he actually does a good job. It doesn't feel fake, but its just the execution that doesn't work. And is it me or does the casting for these fluctuate so much? Why isn't Sam Neill in this, what happened to his character? Obviously he's alive because he appears in the third film. What, did he take a vacation? This is never explained. And we are left with Jeff um uh uh Goldblum. And instead of Dr. Sattler, we get a very young Julianne Moore. And the black girl, was totally useless. As a whole the characters seem to change out so much, its mindboggling. This film is a mess and didn't need to happen. Now to grade.

While this film doesn't live up to the excellence of the first film, it's still an entertaining and great film. It doesn't have the same care in having the gore out of the camera's view like they did in Jurassic Park; it's darker; scary; and tense, though sadly it doesn't build up in the same nerve-wrecking way as the first one did, though this addition certainly has it's very tense thrills, like the climax (which I absolutely love, by the way) and in the buildings on the island.

219,eamon-hennedy,Great Dino Fun!,10,28 October 2003,"I have to say, I really, REALLY, enjoy this film. Sure it ain't art, and after Schindler's List, that may be considered a bit of a disappointment for critics and followers of Spielberg, but boy is this film great fun and not only that, the film follows its own sense of fun too. Check out T-Rex destroying San Diego and the homages thrown throughout to the Godzilla movies as well as a cameo from the film's scriptwriter being eaten. I'm sorry, but for me this is representative of what going to the movies is sometimes about. Having a fun time. I'd almost go out on a limb and say it was better than the first film.Okay that may be a bit strong, but I find there so much more to enjoy here. As much as I love the first film, there is a wee bit of sentimentality about it. Having the child hater turn into a father figure played a big part in the first film, but as Spielberg has upped the ante here as well as include more dinosaurs and more elaborate action sequences there isn't as much room for the 'family' margin, even though that gets a look in too. Nope, this is not about Spielberg the filmmaker, this is about Spielberg the entertainer. He's not aiming for Oscars here, instead it's all about creating a thrill packed ride which is what we get. There are many a classic action-horror moment here. The moment where all that separates the character of Sarah (Julianne Moore) from imminent death is a sheet of glass is one of the most nerve wracking moments committed to film, while the Raptor attack in the field is undeniably sheer genius and the ending where San Diego gets flattened by the T-Rex itself is so much fun and contains so much going on that it's worthwhile watching the film again.With an increase in the violent content (how this only got a PG in Britain is beyond me, a 12 or even 15 would have been more appropriate) this is indicative at the same time of Spielberg's darker sensibilities coming out of him. Unlike Jurassic Park there are no scenes set in blazing sun shine, instead we get lots of rain and dark clouds covering each moment, while Kaminski's photography enhances the more darker look of the film. The death scenes are more elaborate here. Why have one T-Rex eat a hapless victim when you can have two and when you have a waterfall why not have blood ooze from it when a victim is eaten. Yep, it's almost like Temple Of Doom all over again.I know the film has its haters, but this is one film that I find hugely entertaining. While the novelty factor of the CGI does not flood the film so much here, the more ruthless action sequences more than makes  up for it. It's a Hollywood blockbuster.

Both were little more than mindless entertainment, but at least that was the point of ""Angels"" and it succeeded brilliantly. All TLW proved was they could build on the special effects successes of the original and add a lame plot and lamer characters. I mean, this is little more than ""King Kong"" brought to the 90's with up to date effects. Greedy corporate types go to remote island to bring back monster to put on display. Monster wreaks havoc, both on the island and in the USA. Lots of people die (mainly because of stupid decision by all concerned), the monster is eventually brought under control, roll the credits, the end. The only two characters even remotely interesting are Jeff Goldblum's Ian and the big game hunter Roland. Ian correctly forecasts doom and disaster, but what difference does it make since no one listens to him? And Roland is the only character with any dimension. On the one hand, his primary motivation is to bag a T-Rex as the ultimate trophy, on the other, he's about the only one with an ounce of common sense (besides Ian, that is). You've got Julianne Moore as the naive scientist who seems to think dinosaurs are little more than cuddly teddy bears, and the insanely idiotic Nick Van Owen, whose practically every move served to put people's lives at risk. Let's see, you've got an injured baby T-Rex, let's bring it inside the trailer to heal it while the parents are searching for it. And let's release all the caged dinos, thus turning the well organized camp into a chaotic mess. Finally, when he shows the bullets he removed from Roland's gun, I'm amazed Ian and the rest didn't just heave him off the helicopter for ruining the one chance of survival for pretty much everyone on the island. And if that's not bad enough, who on Earth thinks the authorities are going to just let a full grown Tyrannasaur roam about San Diego without doing anything about it while Ian and Dr. Stupid (AKA Sarah) do a repeat of the infant dino bit to lure Mommy back onto the cargo ship? My bet is in reality they'd have had helicopter gunships on it in a heartbeat.

Strangely, the Directing is not great here (or maybe it's the Editing - but that's a Director's job too...) which is not normal for Speilberg. But, maybe he's forgiven, because this is a complete mutt of a script and the key performers (Mr Ham) Goldblum and (Mrs Ham) Julianne Moore are utterly apalling - if you add in Vince Vaughn ( God Help Us) the chances of tuly bad are going to be high. I expect poor performace from Goldblum as he is a rubbish actor, period. Moore should have dragged in some basic skills, even if she's just doing it for the paycheck - but, oh no. They both put the kiss of death onto a badly scripted and badly paced film. Jurassic was over by the time this second rate meal came out but somebody should have shown some pride in their work. The audience were treated with contempt and therefore the film should be equally treated the same way. Do Not Bother.",The Lost World - Jurassic Park
226,Peter T. Movie,Good movie but a few things...,9,21 December 1998,"I like both movies, but there is something strange going on with the Dinosaurs. This can be both good, and bad. The thing is the behavior. In JP the T-Rex would shake its prey to death, but in ""The Lost World"" the T-Rex crushes its prey to death. In JP raptors can open doors, but in LW they can't. Why are there so many changes in the behavior of the Dinosaurs? It seems that the Dinosaurs behavior and actions in ""The Lost World"" are more scientificly accurate then in JP. It doesn't bother me, but I thought it would be good to point it out.",The Lost World - Jurassic Park

Once you've seen a T-Rex destroy a car, It gets old really fast. This movie wasn't a disaster like ""Godzilla"", but It had it's share of cliches and repeated scenes from the original movie, like the ""T-Rex chasing the car"" seen (towards the end of the movie). And cliches like: humans out running dinosaurs on foot.",The Lost World - Jurassic Park
228,Peter T. Movie,I liked it.,9,20 November 1999,"The Lost World: Jurassic Park is a very enjoyable film and almost lives up to the first one. When I saw it in 1997 for the first time, I was shaking like crazy. The scenes that scared me the most where:1. the first scene with the T-rexes when Sara opens the door of the trailer and the T-rex is staring right at her.2. when to T-rex sticks it's head in the tent.(I was terrified!)3. when Sara is on the cracking class.4. when the Raptor jumps on sara's back.(that was completely unexpected).
I love both JP movies and I own them also. The main reasons why a lot of people disliked this movie is either they were expecting too much, or they just don't look for the right things in a movie. When I look at a JP movie, I look for suspense, action, surprises, good acting, and realism. The Lost World provided all of that. Therefore I liked it. When I saw The Lost World in the theater, I walked away from that movie convinced that I had seen a real Dinosaur. THAT, my friends, is what makes JP movies so wonderful. Jurassic Park and it's sequal are the only movies in the world that can do that (when it comes to dinosaurs). Godzilla('98), lacks all of that except action which is not enough to make a good movie. Godzilla and his babies had no personalities, because of this, it was very hard to believe Godzilla was real. Jurassic Park movies give all of there Dinosaurs personalities. When you watch a JP movie, you know the difference between the way a Raptor acts and the way a T-rex acts. If it wasn't for that, the Dinosaurs would be faker than ever, regardless of the really good CGI. The Dinosaurs do more than just run around eating people, each Dinosaur does it their own way. I encourage everyone to give this over bashed sequel a different look. You might be surprised!My rating: 9 out of 10. One point lost for story.",The Lost World - Jurassic Park
229,jiangliqings,Spielberg's direction and the special effects make up for the flaws in this intensely entertaining ride.,8,25 May 2001,"*** out of ****With Jurassic Park III to be released in a month, it will be interesting to see if new director Joe Johnston can outdo Spielberg's work in the previous two installments.  He's got a lot to live up to, because while the stories haven't always been spectacular, Jurassic Park was excellent escapist entertainment and The Lost World is a worthy, albeit significantly flawed, sequel.  It's been 4 years since the disaster that occurred at Jurassic Park.  The company's new CEO, Peter Ludlow (Arliss Howard) has dissolved his Uncle John Hammond's (Richard Attenborogh) and has plans to create a new park right in San Diego.  Hammond quickly forms a team to rival Ludlow's, which is led by chaotician/mathematician Ian Malcolm (Jeff Goldblum).  Also along for the ride are photographer/Earth man Nick Van Park (Vince Vaughn), communications expert Eddie Carr (Richard Schiff), and Malcolm's girlfriend and palentologist, Sarah Harding (Julianne Moore), with Malcolm's daughter also along as a stowaway.Apparently, the island they're headed for is called Site B, where they actually manufactured and created the dinosaurs, then sent them over to the park.  When Ludlow's team arrives, with the help of a big-game hunter named Roland Tumbo (Pete Postlethwaite), they entrap several dinosaurs, including an injured baby tyrannosaurus rex.  Nick releases the animals and brings the injured rex back to the group's trailers, and chaos ensues when the parents looking for their child, leaving the team's supplies destroyed and short one team member.  They are forced to team up with Ludlow and Tumbo, and they must reach the island village to raise communication and rescue.I'm a little surprised to say that I liked and enjoyed this film quite a bit.  I'll mention the flaws first. The story's often quite weak, most of the characters are rote and sometimes downright stupid, and the film lacks the predecessor's sense of awe.  Let me go into the characters first.  Believe it or not, the ones that annoy us the most are those in the ""good guys"" team.  Julianne Moore's Sarah Harding is a complete moron.  She claims the team is on the island to study and not interact, yet she goes right up and pets a baby stegosaurus on the head, then gets all the other dinosaurs in that nest riled up.  She also carries around this ""lucky"" backpack, often leaves it lying around places where some small dinosaur could come by, then even carries it around when it's covered in blood!  Smart, especially when that giant t-rex comes by looking for food and territory.Vince Vaughn (who, incidentally, appeared with Moore in the Psycho remake) makes a very small impression as Nick Van Park.  His character stupidly brings back an injured and growling baby t-rex, which puts his colleagues in danger and results in another person's death, and he never even seems the least bit sorry for it.  Vaughn's decision to play him as a rather understated man is commendable, but he doesn't make much of an impression. Vanessa Lee Chester is absolutely useless as Ian Malcolm's daughter.  I'm sure she was just used to appeal to the younger crowd but that just puts a jarring difference in the film's tone, which is usually dark and violent. She gets the worst lines, delivers them unconvincingly, and also has a ludicrous scene where she uses gymnastics to kill a raptor.  I was just rooting for these three to get eaten before the film was over.  Alas, that was not to happen.There are other problems I could go into but I'll go with what I do like, and the good outweighs the bad quite a bit.  Spielberg's direction is first-rate (maybe not for him, but certainly in comparison to most other action directors).  I've always considered him cinema's best action/thriller director and he doesn't disappoint here.  The action and suspense sequences are tense and thrilling.I have some particularly favorite moments.  I loved the scene with Moore lying on the end of the trailer with the glass slowly cracking with every small move she makes.  All the scenes that involve the raptors are probably the film's best.  Each raptor attack is intense and engaging.  The main focus this time is on the t-rex, and the big boy (and girl if you include the mother) doesn't disappoint.  The t-rex is an immense and fearsome sight, and it's fun to behold a creature of this stature in a contrast between the jungle and suburbia.John Williams' score is also effective in creating some tension.  The score is a bit different than his composition in Jurassic Park, it's slightly weaker and features a lot of annoyind drum-banging (as with almost every island adventure flick) but he hits more right notes than wrong ones.If there's a flaw in these exciting moments, it's Spielberg's decision to film virtually all of it during the night.  While there is an oppressive atmosphere in that condition, it gets annoying after a while.  As a matter of fact, as I think about it, nearly the last hour of the film takes place in complete darkness.The special effects are every bit as awesome as they were in Jurassic Park, and there are even more and different dinosaurs in this film.  The stegosaurus makes an appearance and the procompsagnathus are an appropriately cute and menacing sight.  Along with the variety of dinos comes an increase in violence.  I'm sure the PG-13 rating must have been a close call.  There are chewed up bodies, gory dinosaur graveyards, ferocious dino attacks, and a severed hand (which actually gets an unintentional laugh from me) (When you see that scene, ask yourself where the body went).  This film is definitely too intense for younger children.  The acting is not bad, though with the exception of Goldblum and Postlethwaite, they're all completely overshadowed by the dinosaurs. Goldblum is funny and amusing as Ian Malcolm, and though his character is sometimes a little irritating he's an absolute genius in comparison to his group members.  Postlethwaite as the hunter is quite an interesting character.  His indifference to anything except for his best friend Ajay and the hunt is fascinating; pity it's not developed very well.  Arliss Howard as Peter Ludlow is okay, as good as possible a person can do playing a one-dimensional villain.There was an extended television version released, though despite one brief humorous scene involving a man hitting his crotch, it's more of hindrance by holding off the dinosaur action by an extra six or so minutes.  It's not particularly compelling to watch a group of business executives talking about...well, business.The film's conclusion is weak in my opinion.  Spielberg's decision to change the setting to somewhere closer to home is obviously a change of pace and while it's something new, it's not necessarily what's best.  But to his credit, I was so enthralled by the action that I was feeling lenient by the time the end reels began.  This is by no means a masterpience or a match to the original, but it makes for 129 minutes (135 if you see the TV version) of raptor-paced entertainment.  I've read some initial plot summaries on Jurassic Park III and the story doesn't sound like any great shakes, so director Joe Johnston's only chance of success is making it as exciting as this film or the original.  And, hey, he'll also have Sam Neill in the lead role, who was sorely missed in The Lost World.",The Lost World - Jurassic Park
230,Eamonn_green,Best film ever!,10,17 August 2002,"Right this is the best of the Jurassic Park films. The special effects for this film were class. The acting by Pete Postlethwaite(In the name of the father), Jeff Goldblum(Jurassic Park), Julianne Moore(Hannibal) and Vince Vaughn(Psycho) is very good. It is loosely based on the book and did not have some of the main characters from the book but that didn't make the film any worse! It had the best and most tense parts from the book. The trailer hanging over the edge of the cliff? Why didn't people like the San Diego part? It was entertaining and had action. Or did you want something different from this film?
A reviewer complained that it didn't have enough gore. Ok take the gory parts from the book and remember that this film wasn't just for an older audience. Oh how would a child react to a man getting his intestine ripped out by a dinosaur or a man's crotch being bit off by a dinosaur? Or would that not be gory enough? Gore is only essential for horror movies and The Lost World or any of the Jurassic Park movies are anything but horror films. They are Sci-fi adventure films.So why do people not like this film? It had more action than the other 2 in the series. The special effects were better. It was more entertaining.What did people expect? A horror film? Then they were expecting too much and were disappointed.A great film if you want to be entertained for 2 hours watch this. 10 out of 10.",The Lost World - Jurassic Park
231,Funky A,Something has survived...and it's a bad thing!,3,2 February 2000,"This has nothing to do with the excellent Michael Crichton sequel to Jurassic Park. This movie is bad to the last drop. It's a boring dinosaur movie with all the problems of a sequel. The story is uninteresting, to say the least, and is nothing more than cheap excuse to put people on an island full of hungry dinosaurs. All those hunters have the words ""EAT-ME"" printed on their forehead. Malcom's daugther could win the prize for most annoying character ever and the others are not much better. You just hope they all get eaten so you can just get out of the stupid island but no... they had to put a T-Rex in the city! This part of the movie is simply TOO boring. Your watching your watch and are asking yourself ""how long can it be before they catch that stupid T-Rex!?"". They only ""quality"" bad sequels have is that they are short, so you don't suffer very long, but this movie is painfully long(134 min)! The only thing this movie does right are the special effects. But how long can you watch dinosaurs run everywhere, no matter how beautiful they are? I can't repeat it too often: this movie is terrible!3 out of 10. A bad sequel.",The Lost World - Jurassic Park
232,TimBoHannon,Solid Entertainment Despite not Matching the Original,7,2 November 2008,"With the serious inflation of movie ticket prices this decade, it can be easy to lose historical perspective on the popularity of older movies. ""Jurassic Park"" shattered the box-office money record by over 150 million dollars. It has since been passed nine times, but truly was one of the great cinematic events in history. Director Steven Spielberg's movie employed more realistic and intricate animatronics than any previously seen. Its Computer Generated Images (CGI) revolutionized special effects. The T-1000 from the second Terminator film had been the crowing achievement in visual effects to that point; ""Jurassic Park"" showed humans and technological illusions interacting in ways far exceeding anything that came before. If it were released as is, those images might earn Oscar Nominations today. A sequel to such a groundbreaking and competently made film comes with titanic expectations. When ""The Lost World"" is judged by its own merits, a lot of good comes to the surface. It does not match its predecessor, nor does it need to for satisfying entertainment.Sam Neill and Laura Dern do not return for the sequel. Thankfully, Jeff Goldblum does. Golblum's Dr. Malcolm lightened ""Jurassic Park"" with his pithy summaries of the various situations. Some were sarcastic; others told the truth in an amusing way. Goldblum knows the correct approach for a man completely unaware the humor inherent in his words. The sequel misses the characters who do not return, but Malcolm is indispensable. ""Jurassic Park 3"" proves how mundane Neill's Dr. Grant is without Goldblum around.Richard Attenborough is the only other actor to return. Again he plays John Hammond, the mastermind behind the dinosaur amusement park. Attenborough has the same exuberance and ready smile as before. He is more reserved since Hammond is older and not as healthy. He was 73 when the movie was filmed, but his performance makes Hammond seem ten years younger.Hammond grew Jurassic Park's dinosaurs on another island. One day, a wealthy couple stops on the island and some small dinosaurs injure their daughter (Camilla Belle, who has had some lead roles since). Hammond's nephew Peter (Arliss Howard) uses the incident to dissolve his uncle's power. Hammond knows that Peter will ""pillage"" the park, so he summons Malcolm to request his presence on an observation team. Ian bluntly refuses, but a new development changes his mind. Meanwhile, Peter prepares his own team for a trip with less noble aims.Since all but three characters know what creatures are on the island, the wonder and amazement factor is mostly absent. Instead, the movie generates pathos for the dinosaurs. A cruel hunter (Pete Postlethwaite) breaks an infant T-Rex' leg and ties him to the ground. The animal's wails of pain and cries for his parents tug on the heartstrings of anybody who has a four-legged pet. The movie includes an extended scene of people mistreating frightened animals who wish them no harm. Even Dr. Malcolm, who plans to kill any dinosaur at the first sign of trouble, has moral issues with that behavior. When two other members of the observation team (Julianne Moore and Vince Vaughn) make a critical error, the situation becomes far more dangerous.I will not comment on the ending except to say that it is a puzzling decision by the writers. It left many people scratching their heads. ""The Lost World"" did not approach the box office total of its predecessor as sequels to popular movies typically do. The final half hour may have generated some poor word of mouth or discouraged repeat business. In any case, it is unnecessary.It would have been better to prolong the main portion, which contains more carnage than the first movie. The two best scenes are the ""cliffhanger"" problem and the final confrontation with the raptors. The quality of the raptor scene meets Steven Spielberg standards. It is the cliffhanger, however, that equals anything the first movie offers. Young directors should observe how Spielberg films them. He uses many extended shots to best demonstrate the relative locations and actions of the characters. He prefers long, moving shots to quick editing. Goldblum provides the lightness with his comments. He has the most fun during Malcolm's radio conversation with an unpleasant lady. Spielberg and Goldblum elevate a movie that could have been a major disappointment. With them, ""The Lost World"" earns seven marks from a possible ten. Without them, it would be a disaster.",The Lost World - Jurassic Park
233,KillerLord,Well Done But Diminished Glory,7,8 October 2008,"When the Jurassic Park came out it opened a whole new world for us and captured our attention. There is no doubt about the fact independent who creates the sequel, the sequel will not be able to produce the same awe the first movie gave us. But does this movie do anything new that sets it apart? Well, it does not. It simply extrapolates the idea of its predecessor, changes the locations and gives us better idea as to how insignificant we really be in front of the giant lizards made alive in the first movie. The central plot of this movie is that a team of hunters have brought back a dinosaur to the city and needless to say, as most people can guess, it is somehow free and is endangering the city. This movie sort of reminded me of the Godzilla concept wherein a monster of similar size is roaming free in the city terrorizing the people of the city. So, as such, there is nothing fresh in the plot or the story. The graphics have come of age. There is no awe left. We have already seen them in action. Since this movie comes at a later time and has better technology available to exploit, it creates dinosaurs much more realistic and even more scary and believable and that is the crowning achievement of the movie. But there is nothing more this movie has to offer. No interesting story line, no interesting twists! Just plain old plot of a monster free in the city and in the end, there is always a way of saving the city only this time it is not by killing the creature but by deporting it to its home island. There are no interesting characters or twists to watch out for but there is still plenty of action. And the action is really well done. The movie loses points for repetitive plot and lack of fresh material as far as the story is concerned but gains full points again for really well done graphics and solid action.",The Lost World - Jurassic Park
234,Tyson14,mommy's very angry,7,7 June 2015,"The Lost World: Jurassic Park is directed by Steven Spielberg and adapted to screenplay by David Koepp from the novel written by Michael Crichton. It stars Jeff Goldblum, Julianne Moore, Pete Postlethwaite, Vince Vaughn, Richard Schiff, Peter Stormare, Vanessa Lee Chester, Arliss Howard and Harvey Jason. Music is scored by John Williams and cinematography by Janusz Kamiński.Four years on from the horrors of Jurassic Park on Isla Nublar, it transpires that there is a second dinosaur site on Isla Sornar. Dr. Ian Malcolm (Goldblum) is forced to head off to face the horrors once again when he learns that his paleontologist girlfriend, Sara Harding (Moore), is already on the island as a forerunner to a team John Hammond (Richard Attenborough) is assembling to document the dinosaurs in their habitat. Once their, though, the problems soon arise, especially when a team from InGen arrive with other ideas about the dinosaurs on their minds...Given the massive success of Jurassic Park in 1993, a sequel was inevitable. What transpires is pretty much more of the same, it's very safe film making by Spielberg. Coming off of the emotional exertions of his last film, Schindler's List, few can deny that the director was entitled to wind down with The Lost World project, there was after all nothing safe about Schindler's, but although Jurassic 2 is a hugely enjoyable family blockbuster, a jazzy bit of hi-tech fun, it lacks the requisite brains to make it an inspiring sequel.Formula follows the same path, humans in peril on the island, with some added and new dinosaurs (double T-Rex a bonus), and then the ""twist"" in the narrative sees some monster peril come to San Diego, King Kong style, for the finale. There's inter fighting between the good dudes led by Malcolm and the bad guys led by the weasely Peter Ludlow (Howard) who is Hammond's conniving nephew and current head of InGen. Family issues also feature, of course since this is Spielberg after all, while the dangers of tampering with science message remains as strong as ever.Cast are ably led by a witty Goldblum, who is a reassuring presence carried over from the first film, and the tech-credits are as expected, very high. Some scenes soar, such as a sequence shot from under a pane of glass that starts to crack under the weight of a character, others not so, such as having Malcolm's teenage daughter turn into Nadia Comăneci for one credulity stretching scene. But all told it's an honest blockbuster purely aimed at the target audience who helped to see it make over $600 million in profit. Safe often pays you see, and as sequels go it's one of the better ones in the 90s. It's exciting if intellectually stunted.",The Lost World - Jurassic Park
235,amiranda-39274,Life Breaks Free: A Worthy Sequel,8,15 March 2021,"After a long hiatus from directing, Steven Spielberg returned to direct a sequel to the glorious Jurrassic park, and based this movie off Michael Crichton's sequel novel, but made massive changes to the source material. This has angered many fans of the novel, and this film lives in infamy as not being as good as the first movie for other reasons as well, is this true, I don't believe so, and i hope to convince you with this review.Story: This time we are introduced to the dinosaurs much faster than in the previous film, because this time we learn there is a second island where the dinosaurs were created for the park, and because of other unforeseen disasters, the dinosaurs are loose all over this island. Desiring to compensate for their losses, the company that created the dinos, INGEN sends a team of hunters to capture as many dinosaurs as possible and bring them to San Diego to create a new park. As Malcolm says later, that is the worst idea in the history of worst ideas. Wanting to keep as much distance as possible from the nightmare he experienced in the first film, Malcolm refuses to try and stop the dinos despite the pleading of John Hammond, but once hes told that his girlfriend Sarah is already on the island doing ecological conservation work, he is now forced to go to the island with a ragtag group, Malcolm experiences the same nightmares all over again. After the "" OOOhs, AAhhhhs, the running and the screaming"", the film has its last act set in San Diego, when a T rex is transported there, escaping and causing havoc in the big city. Despite not being as clean cut as the first film, thsi movie still gives me the same feels as the first one, and it has more dino action, and takes us to new environments we couldn't have even dreamed about.Characters:
Jeff Goldblum returns as Malcom, this time being the main character, despite still having his sarcasm and chaos theories, he is far more cynical and paranoid in this film. But he is given the chance to be the hero and seems to be the only sane man in an insane world.
Joining him on his journey is Malcolm's daughter, Kelly. Despite being just the tag along kid for this movie, she proves to be capable despite being terrified most of the time. Her gymnastics play a role in the film that is questionable but makes her useful.
Juliana moore plays Sarah, Malcolm's girlfriend and a dino expert. Despite having her cool moments, most of the time she acts like shes competent but she ends up making egregious mistakes. This behavior makes her irritating at times, but at least she redeems herself.
Vince vaughn is a extreme ecological conservationist, despite being apart of the designated heroes group, he ends up being one of the most irritating characters in the film. Mostly because, everybody who dies in the film is directly his fault. Despite these consequences he survives the island and disappears from the movie. Roland Tembo is the last of the philosopher hunters, he oozes charisma and has so much badassery, that you kind of wish he was the main character. There are many other extra characters that all serve their roles and are each interesting with the little screen time they are given like John Hammond.The Dinosaurs: Despite having many of the same dinosaurs from the first film, I'm not complaining, since i love seeing the t rexs and the raptors again. But I am overjoyed that so many new dinosaurs are added to the roster, we get to see a lot of them during the hunting scenes, but I feel they cpold have been used more. The most terrifying new addition to the film are the Compy's, which still freak me out as adult. The lore of INGENs experiments and the dinosaurs is added to this film by showing Isla Sorna, its inhabitants and the village. There were still so many dinosaurs that we could have seen, such as the deleted pterodactyls scenes, but im grateful for what we got, it still makes me more interested in what other kinds of species INGEN created in their labs. The special effects used for the dinos still look incredible all these years later, thanks to the healthy blend of CGI and practical effects.The Action:
There are so many action sequences in this movie that they outnumber the amount in the first film, while these action scenes do take up the majority of the movie, I'm not complaining. My favorite scenes include the hunters capturing the wild dinosaurs, the t rex's wrecking the RV and the glass scene, the "" Don't Go into the Long Grass"" scene, the ghost ship arriving in san Diego, and lastly the San Diego incident entirely. Yes it is a ripoff of Godzilla, but that was intentional, and being a kid from San Diego, I absolutely love that my home town was used in a jurrassic park movie! There are just so many action set pieces that I love to watch over and over.Music: John Williams returns to give us even more spectacular scores, the most noticeable being the use of congas and flutes, but also just the reprisals of the original jurrassic park score is always emotional to hear. My favorite musical score in the film being the part where the designated heroes are hanging on a cliff and are rescued by Roland and his hunters, I get so overjoyed in that moment.In Conclusion: I believe this movie is a worthy sequel, yes there are silly moments, irritating characters, and some unintentional hilarious scenes, but it delivers everything you could ever want from a Jurassic park film. We've got new and old dinosaurs, we've got impressive action sequences, more death, and new lore added to the first Jurrassic park. Yes, the first Jurrassic Park is untouchable, its just a masterpiece that couldn't hope to be topped, but this movie does a good job in continuing that story, and after watching the first film, I'm always excited to watch this movie next.

I thought that was fascinating. Nevertheless, the movie was pretty good all the way around, particularly for a sequel. The Compsognathus scenes were a little hard to believe (even for a dinosaur movie). I just don't see a 2-foot-tall dinosaur having the ability to kill a man, even if it hunts in packs. But hey, Compsognathus needs love too. (OK, since I wrote this review ""Crocodile Hunter"" Steve Irwin has been killed by a stingray, so I concede that anything's possible. But I don't see Compsognathus actively seeking out humans to kill when we're three times its size.) Every dinosaur movie should have a Stegosaurus cameo; I think that should be law. Most of the characters are a little bland; the Jeff Goldblum mathematician dude was probably the best of the bunch. But that's the only flaw in a pretty good sequel.",The Lost World - Jurassic Park
238,arnieiam,Underrated,8,14 May 2008,"I saw this movie when I was a kid about 10 years back. I felt nostalgic, so I went to my cupboard, took out the VHS and placed in on my VCR. This movie is pretty much underrated. Since it didn't follow the novel that much and it had a bit of flat dialogue and characterization, it received 50 % positive reviews. I believe this film was better than the first in some ways. It had really good action sequences and its visual effects were ahead of its time. Even after the release of so many movies that have advanced in effects such as Transformers, Lord of the Rings, The Matrix, Spider-Man, King Kong (2005), Pirates of the Caribbean, etc. I still found the effects very believable. So believable that when I saw the scene with the Rex chasing the hunters and the other scene where the Rexes push the trailer off the cliff, I had a heart attack. This movie also one upped from its predecessor by placing the T-Rex in an actual city, and this was a year before Godzilla came out. In terms of characterization, I liked it that they made the genius mathematician Ian Malcolm the top character of the story. In the novel he was a key character who actually predicted that the park would fail, yet in the first movie it was more about Dr. Grant and the kids. The only thing that this movie may have failed in is just the dialogue which sounded a bit rehearsed, rushed, too quiet and used a bit too many big words and when I saw this movie I was 7 so I had a bit of trouble on trying to capture the plot. In the end this movie deserved better ratings and I will always be a fan of this epic franchise.",The Lost World - Jurassic Park

Sadly the same can not be said for the second film. This is one example of where the movie is actually better then the novel. The Lost World by Michael Crichton was a good novel but nowhere near as exciting or as adventurous as the original.The movie sequel improves it, but not by much. Actors such as Jeff Goldblum (who is always great), Julianne Moore, Vince Vaughn and Pete Postlewaite all put on amazing performances. But the rest of the movie drags on in so many places. The movie could have been cut in sequences and made shorter as it would have allowed the pace to continue on more.The special effects were amazing as were some of the stunt sequences involved. As cool as it was to see the T-Rex play havoc in San Diego at the end, it was not really needed. They could have ended it a different way back in the island.Steven Spielberg had even gone on record saying this was an inferior film to the original. And he is right.

241,jmmustchin,Light entertainment,8,27 October 2018,"I watched this the day after the first Jurassic Park (which I consider one of the greatest films ever made). I found the film rather disappointing. It simply doesn't live up to the original.Dr Ian Malcolm (Jeff Goldblum) and other characters travel to an island nearby to Nublar, where the cloned dinosaurs were raised. They are on a mission for John Hammond, whose nephew wants to recreate Jurassic Park - in San Diego! The nephew has also sent a team to the island - to hunt a T-Rex for the park.Despite what that may have sounded like, the plot is actually rather thin. Much of the movie is the people being chased on the island - and eaten. More than halfway through the movie, I was still waiting for it to entertain me.This film is very violent - much more so than the original. It's also scarier. The movie isn't nearly as good as the original.That said, it isn't a total loss. I liked the twin climaxes - which were terrifyingly good (literally), and redeemed the film a little. But the biggest point in the film's favour is the special effects - which are AT LEAST as good as the original! The dinos - particularly the T-Rexes - are frighteningly real.If you're looking for a good scare, this is it.",The Lost World - Jurassic Park
242,roystephen-81252,Needs a couple of rewatching to be really entertaining,7,13 February 2016,"I had read Michael Chrichton's The Lost World before I went to see Spielberg's sequel to his wonderful Jurassic Park, and I prayed the director would deviate significantly from that shallow, uninspired mess that simply regurgitates elements from the first, magnificently written novel. He did, but after seeing the film I wish he hadn't, because Spielberg's and David Koepp's story feels even more forced and illogical than the novel. The script is poor and incoherent, and the characters are clichéd and uninteresting (save for Ian Malcolm and Roland Tembo, played by the great Pete Postlethwaite). I saw The Lost World and Men in Black back to back in the theatre, and I found the latter immensely more entertaining.Not everything's bad, though. Stan Winston's team surpassed themselves again, and created the most realistic dinosaurs in any of the four Jurassic movies produced so far. John Williams composed an excellent score for the film (again, probably the best in the series), and Janusz Kaminsky's cinematography is of top quality, as always (that shot of the slowly cracking window pane - just brilliant). There are memorable moments (e.g. the attacking raptors in the tall grass) and memorable quips (mainly from Jeff Goldblum, the real saving grace for the movie), but Spielberg probably took on the task of directing the sequel only because he wanted to capture his childhood dream on film (a T. Rex looking in the window of a child's room), and it shows. No wonder he had become disenchanted with the movie by the time he finished it.Surprisingly, The Lost World has grown on me somewhat over the years, because it proved to be highly rewatchable. I still find it the least satisfying Jurassic flick, but Goldblum's charisma, that window pane, the shot of approaching raptors in the grass, or the tribal drums during the double T. Rex attack on Eddie stop me dead in my tracks every time.",The Lost World - Jurassic Park
243,Jsimpson5,"A decent, but flawed sequel",6,5 May 2008,"A decent follow up to the first Jurassic Park film, but it could have been better. Basically the film takes place a few years after the accident at the island. Ian is now considered crazy by his peers for comments about the island. While visiting the creator of the island he learns that there was another island and a friend of Ian's is on the island.There are some things that I did like about the film. The CGI effects are still great, and there is some character development this time around, which is a nice change so it shows that characters are not always the same through the whole film.The script I felt was weak at times. Mainly the times with the Ingen corp group I felt there was some stock scripting and nothing felt like it could really happen. There are fewer kids in this film which is a plus since the kids int he first film and the kids in this film don't seem realistic. The kids act like movie kids, which doesn't make them as realistic as they could be.Overall it's not a bad sequel and it does follow the previous film well, but some flaws bog down the potential of a film that could have been a lot more.",The Lost World - Jurassic Park
244,james_corck3,Very decent sequel,8,27 October 2005,"I am probably one of the few who like this movie. First of all, I read the Best Seller novel before see the movie in theaters, so I had like an idea of how the movie would look like. I felt disappointed because many things were deleted (many attack scenes, gory moments, some more dinosaur deaths) and some annoying stuff was added (Ian's daughter, Nick Van Owen, Arliss Howard character...)But the movie has a scene of T Rexes attacking more vehicles (this dinosaurs have problems with the Car company or something, maybe they hate Mercedes) which is very cool, and has lots of tension, including that cliff-hanger moment when Sarah Harding is on a shattering glass (scary, creepy, bite your finger nails to the bone) Spielberg said that he would never make a sequel of his movies. Well, he didn't plan this, so he did his best on Lost World: Jurassic Park. Is not as good as the first movie, but well, we have some good things not related to the movie. The cinematography of Janusz Kaminski is just outstanding, with those forests and rain-forests full of mist ready to show their danger. The score composed by John Williams is quite different, with more tribal sounds than elegant movements of violins and flutes like in the first movie, is a more pure, rough and finally WILD MUSIC. The special effects are better OK, we see the T Rex attacking some Japanese people like a Godzilla homage. And Jeff Goldblum expands Ian Malcolm to his most acid and ironic characterization, turning him into another Jurassic beast like the T Rex. And for the raptors? Well, let's say that they got stripes and orange skin, instead they grey and brownish colour. Not a good decision.",The Lost World - Jurassic Park

247,KingBrian1,A Deserving Successor to Jurrassic Park,8,31 May 2014,The Jurassic Park Trilogy is one example of a franchise that works. The Lost World is a worthy sequel to the original. Unlike with the Star Wars Prequel series Jurassic Park is a movie that can produce good TV. A combination of good acting and the realism of the Dinosaurs make it a good watch.The movie is not without faults. The scene when the T-Rex arrives in San Diego is an error in editing as is the villain of the story who is lame and non sensible in his behaviours. Going into the cargo hold to see the baby T-Rex was bad story writing. The other issues concern the lack of fleshing out the tertiary characters and not showing how the T-Rex was taken down which is what I would have liked to see.Omitting those faults the story is still great. An adventure on an Island full of terrifying Lizards. Hunters coming to snatch a T-Rex and bring it back to San Diego for amusement. The references to Cadillac & Dinosaurs is really neat. Also the story touches on the themes of Jules Verne's The Mysterious Island. Obviously the idea of a Dinosaur running around San Diego was original.All in all a good prequel to the original.,The Lost World - Jurassic Park
248,Roger_Sterling,Honestly...,8,30 June 2006,"A 5.6 out of 10? This is probably one of the most underrated movies on IMDb, and that's saying quite a lot. This great sequel deserves at least a 7.0. Is it the worst of the trilogy? In my opinion, TLW and JPIII see-saw as to which is my 2nd favorite of the trilogy, although neither match the original. But when it comes to thrills and action, this movie gets a 9.0. Jeff Goldblum is just as good a leading man as Sam Neill, and the dinosaurs are greater in variety. The bad: the raptors have a much smaller role in this one, and some things are downright laughable. For example, Kelly using gymnastics to get rid of the raptor. While it doesn't deserve as much flack as it gets, it was somewhat lame. 8/10. Heinously underrated.",The Lost World - Jurassic Park
249,MinorityReporter,More hungry dinosaurs!,7,19 November 2005,"After the success of the first film it went pretty much without saying that a sequel would come along and while it was not received as well by critics and general viewers it still had numerous charms. The problem with this sequel is that it lacks the element of surprise and from where I'm standing that is the main problem the film has. Otherwise I believe that it is a fair sequel. In short I liked it.One thing I missed in The Lost World was Sam Neill. I thought he did an exceptional job in the first film and therefore I do not fully understand why he wasn't in the second film (of course I know that his character might not be in the novel upon which the film is based but they could have added him anyway). Instead Jeff Goldblum gets a chance to prove what he can do. He didn't really get to portray many nuances in the first film as a result of relatively limited screen time. In The Lost World , however, he proves that he really can act. He brings the character more down to earth than he was in the first film and it suits the character as he becomes more believable. Julianne Moore does a good job with her character as well. She is a good female counterpart to Goldblum's character as she produces a very likable character. Pete Postlethwaite's character is the most interesting in the film. His reasons for coming to the island are perhaps a bit ridiculous but the way he plays the character makes it worth it. Arliss Howard is a good, greedy villain. He plays the character in a way that makes the character seem like an intelligent character who is blinded by his greed. The supporting cast is good as well. Especially Peter Stormare and Vince Vaughn do good jobs. The acting is overall inferior to that of the first film but it is still very worthwhile.The effects have naturally improved from the first film. Spielberg has himself said that the way he saw it was that people saw the first film to see if they could make the dinosaurs seem believable and since the first film proved that people saw the second film to see what they could do with the dinosaurs. Accordingly the film is full of even more details than the first. There is a high level of interaction. Much more than in the first film and to Spielberg's credit it all works and seems 100% believable. The tyrannosaurus still looks absolutely brilliant and even more detailed than in the first film. You see veins and imperfections. Raptors return as well and the scenes they appear in are very tense like in the first film. Among the additions to the dinosaur cast is the stegosaurus and it, like the other dinosaurs, looks nothing short of impressive. Overall the effects are very good but we already knew that Spielberg could do it so it is really what was to be expected.The story is decent. Spielberg does what he often does. He takes his time and builds up the characters so we as the audience will care about them. Even though the story is not as well conceived as it was in the first film it still works. The film retains the message of the first film, making it more than just an effects movie. The message of course being that man should not play God and let nature find its own way. Other than this the story is both tense, interesting and allows the characters to grow. Some people found the ending a bit ridiculous and a bit of a copy of Godzilla but I didn't see that. I thought it was very tense and atmospheric.Overall I agree with the general consent that The Lost World is not as good as the original but in my opinion it is not a bad film either. The Lost World has a lot to offer both in terms of storytelling but of course also in terms of effects. The only advice I can give future viewers is that you should watch the film with an open mind and try not to let yourself be too affected by the negative tone surrounding the film.7/10",The Lost World - Jurassic Park

I could blame Michael Crichton for turning out the worst novel of his career, one so filled with bad plot twists, cardboard characters and hackneyed dialog as well as being confused about whether it's a sequel to the original novel (where both John Hammond and Ian Malcolm were killed) or the movie (where they both lived) that it certainly would be easy.  However, screenwriter David Koepp decided to discard all but a few scenes from the book and concoct something equally inept on his own.  I could blame him.  I could blame Speilburg, perhaps the best director of his generation, for helming such a piece of sludge, designed merely to sell toys and lunchboxes. Casting blame his way goes without saying.Ultimately however, blame for this waste of celluloid goes to every one of us nitwits who paid to see this and have let Universal know that we are cattle who will shower money on any dino drivel thrown at us.",The Lost World - Jurassic Park

254,mrrockey,Weak Script But Fun Action,6,18 June 2014,"The Lost World: Jurassic Park is another unnecessary, cash-grab sequel to a highly successful film. Even though many of the cast and crew return, such as Spielberg, screenwriter David Koepp, Jeff Goldblum, Richard Attenborough, John Williams, and editor Michael Kahn, it really is an inferior film. I think Spielberg and Koepp came into it with the right intentions but somehow, nothing just seems as magical as it was the first time. But does that make The Lost World bad? Let's find out!The film follows Dr. Ian Malcolm after the events of the first film where he has now publicized the incident at Jurassic Park with a strong lack of belief from the public. John Hammond then contacts Ian to travel to Jurassic Park site B, Isla Sorna, where the dinosaurs were first engineered but have now run amok due to a hurricane destroying the containment facilities, to document the dinosaurs with a team in their natural habitat to get public support against the site from being exploited by InGen. Ian initially refuses, but decides to go after hearing his wife, Sarah, is already there. Meanwhile, they come across InGen mercenaries capturing dinosaurs there for another park being built in San Diego.The most noticeable problems with The Lost World are the characterizations and the ""been there, done that"" feel. The film's characters, are either blandly uninteresting, or annoying and stupid. While the first film didn't have exceptionally well-written characters, they were all well-defined and likable. Here, the characters are all just so weak and forgettable. While Goldblum is generally likable in the film, whenever he has a dramatic moment, he seems tired and uninterested. Julianne Moore is OKAY as Sarah, but she doesn't make much of an impression and her character is pretty fwcking stupid in places when she fearlessly gets up close to the dinosaurs to observe them and hangs blood stained shirts in a tent that end up attracting the dinosaurs. Vanessa Lee Chester is simply awful as Kelly, Ian's daughter. She embodies the annoying, irritating kid character everybody hates such as Jake Lloyd's Anakin Skywalker and the way she's written isn't much better. They have this little sub-plot about her and Ian not spending enough time and how he's never much of a dad to her and Ian goes through an arc in the film learning to be a better father. I really don't like this sub-plot because it's so cliché and overdone these days and it feels like such artificial drama. It really comes across as a cheap way to add an emotional core to the film. I cringed every time she's on screen. The rest of the actors, such as Vince Vaughn, Peter Postlewaite, Richard Schiff, and Arliss Howard are OKAY in their roles, but again, don't make any sort of impression whatsoever. The only real character I liked, was John Hammond once again played by Richard Attenborough. Even though it's only a bit part, Attenborough is extremely compelling to watch and is easily the best actor out of the whole film.The film also doesn't feel fresh. While the plot isn't an exact copy of the first film, a lot of the scenes come off as a lame attempt to give you that ""wow"" factor from watching the original but since we've already seen this before, it just doesn't have the same impact. For example, remember the iconic ""Welcome to Jurassic Park scene."" from the first film? Well, here, they try to do a similar thing with Ian and Sarah looking in awe of these Stegosaurus's but it just doesn't wow like it did the first time. Especially since the Stegosaurus's are some of the weaker effects in the film. They also do a similar scene where a T-Rex puts his head through a tent with the people inside it trying not to make a sound to avoid his awareness JUST like the scene with the kids in the car with the T-Rex outside from the original. These scenes just feel like lame attempts to emulate the first film and lacks impact as result.But if I were to say I didn't enjoy this film, I'd be lying. While it's certainly not a great film in terms of characterization and a lot of the scenes DO feel like cheap knock-offs of the original, this is an undeniably entertaining movie. The dinosaurs are just as cool as they were in the first film with slightly improved special effects. The action scenes, while a little implausible in places, are nonetheless, very well staged and often have good suspense to them. My favorite scene's probably the T-Rex's rampage through San Diego, that was awesome.Overall, if you can get past the weak characterizations and the ""been there, done that"" feeling, you'll enjoy this film for its outstanding action sequences. 6/10",The Lost World - Jurassic Park

Such is the case with The Lost World, it had a lot to uphold to.Although this film is not a total disaster, not in the least, it is very entertaining, it does fall into some of the sequel faults.  Such as trying to be more extreme than the first (bringing the monsters to mainland, and more detailed chase and kill scenes).Although I was not expecting near to the brilliance as the first, and you can't expect that, I thought it this movie would support the first one better than it did.Although not as good as the first, this movie does entertain and is likeable and thus rates a 6/10.",The Lost World - Jurassic Park
256,mbworm,It Still Keeps You on the Edge of Your Feet,8,18 March 2008,"""Jurassic Park"" was a groundbreaking endeavor that featured cloned dinosaurs running amok on an island paradise, terrorizing a group of scientists. Steven Spielberg returns to his dinosaur horror with a new group of scientists including Ian Malcolm from ""Jurassic Park"" (Jeff Goldblum) and Julianne Moore as his quirky paleontologist girlfriend Sarah. They find themselves trapped on Isla Sorna, ""Site B"", where it turns out the dinosaurs were being cloned before being shipped off to the park on Isla Nublar.In the few years since the disaster at Jurassic Park, the dinosaur wildlife on Isla Sorna has flourished and there is an abundance of the fascinating creatures everywhere. It's all good until the carnivores begin trying to eat the scientists, again. The movie is inappropriately long and it tends to drag save for the tense action sequences, but Steven Spielberg and the CGI wizards and magicians at Stan Winston studios have really upped the ante on the special effects. The dinosaurs are amazing and scarier than ever. Overall ""The Lost World"" doesn't live up to ""Jurassic Park"" simply because the novelty has been lost and Steven Spielberg really hams up the drama and keeps the movie running far past a point where our attention spans give up.Although the impact is still truly exciting, ""The Lost World"" fails to capture the ingenuity of the first, resulting in a B movie with grade A production values, just barely passing for an edge of your seat Spielberg classic thriller that still manages to dish out the goods enough for a worthy DVD purchase.",The Lost World - Jurassic Park

However, this all begins on an island away from the first- one without restraints on the animals, and one with an astoundingly steady rate of life and death.In an attempt to study the creatures and bring back proof of the animals' content back to society, Dr. Ian Malcom, and several other scientists set out to the island to record the animals' behaviors. Unfortunately, another group of people have already arrived. -A group with intents of only money-making. -A group that sets the stage for another dangerous time around the dinosaurs.I remember anxiously awaiting this when I was about six years old... and seven.

259,picturetaker,Seeing it in 2017... Uh what was this!?!,3,21 January 2017,"This review absolutely contains some spoilers.I remember seeing this movie when it came out in the theatre. It was a long awaited movie that me and my brother had been waiting for since we saw the first one in 1993. Ah the 1990's movies, some were good and some were awful bad and they were still trying to perfect the blockbuster back then. Some wins like Independence Day and others big time failures like The Flintstones. 20 years later? Uh what was this? Jurrasic Park: The Lost World is in between in my opinion those blockbusters from the 90's. In between a decent CGI blockbuster and a awful one. This movie while decent feels so so. It has a lot wrong with it. And I mean a lot! Lets start with Dr. Ian Malcolm's daughter. Now I don't really care that she is black and he is white. I always just thought he was the kind of good person that adopts a child in need. My problem with her is she couldn't act and she was totally unneeded in the entire movie. Never mind how she got to the Island is a completely mystery to those with half a brain. Like what on earth! How did she hide in the camper that had no real hiding place? Like seriously if we are to believe this, at least show it. Nah don't need that. Never mind Ian Malcolm not saying good-bye or noticing she is not around. In fact another question about these campers is how the flip did they get to the boat that took them to the Island in the first place. When the daughter is on the island, she cooks and makes a fire and that is how they found out. No surprise on the boat or whatever. Nah. Lets not make sense says the movie makers, lets just throw a kid in it like the last JP had so kids seeing the movie will get it.I wish I could say the daughter is the only character that is out of place but basically they all are. Here is a few more. InGen's CEO Peter Ludlow who is trying to save InGen from the financial disaster that came from the original Jurassic Park aftermath. OK. I get it. However why on earth would a CEO ever be on a expedition to get a bunch of dinosaurs off the Island for a zoo. It's like Donald Trump overseeing the construction of one of his buildings on the ground with the construction workers. It does not make sense. Neither would do it.And then there is Vince Vaughn. As a Photographer myself, I understand this character a tad. At least his photography part. I can even over look that his Camera gear is wrong. That's fine, it was the days where only a select few actually took photos so people didn't know including Vince Vaughn. However the unforgivable to his character is the fact he is some sort of Eco Navy Seal Wannabe who frees the dinos and whatever. It was just stupid. And then when they team up later with the group he attacks there is no conflict? None. He even gets the group going again at one point.And don't even get me started on that ridiculous T-Rex in San Diego end. How did it even eat the people on the ship. It would have been better if it was Raptors as that would have made sense. Just plain awful! As you can see, this review is long. Assuming you're still reading it I could go on for pages and pages but the fact is this movie seems rushed. It seems like there wasn't a lot of thought put into it. It just feels and rightly so that it was made because people wanted a sequel. Except it really doesn't feel like a Jurassic Park movie and it is just so full of plot holes.Jurrasic Park is one of Steven Spielburgs best. The Lost World I hate to say is not even close to his best and while not his worst. It isn't even in his top 10 movies he's made.Maybe in 20 years I will watch it again. Nah... Probably not.",The Lost World - Jurassic Park

262,Sharkey360,A huge disappointment!,1,15 September 2000,"There is no doubt that Steven Spielberg has slipped upon his return. With Schindler's List, he was simply the best. This film is his comeback movie, and it really disappoints me to the heart...plus this is where I started having doubts about Steven's credibility.I've read the novel a year before this film came out. The translation from book to film is horrible, and this is a loser in the game of entertainment. We have Dr. Malcolm (Jeff Goldblum) and Harding (played by Julianne Moore) on their story return, but they simply don't fit well with the story.Storywise, this film is better off as a spin-off than a sequel. The Lost World is simply ""more of everything"" from Jurassic Park and a little new touch. Anyone who did not read the book would like this film, but then again there would be some who won't like it.Steven Spielberg's directing here feels weak and generic. In fact, there are other directors out there who can direct this film and even improve on it. Spielberg, who's known for his artistic direction (Raiders of the Lost Ark, Schindler's List, Jaws, etc.), really disappointed me here. I expected better from him.I feel cheated by this film, and cheated by Spielberg. It seemed that this film was made only to squeeze out money from viewers, who would simply pay to see dinosaurs. The plot is very bad, the cast is not good, the special FX are better, and there simply is very little enjoyment with this film.Better not pay a high price to watch this movie. You'll be amazed with the dinosaurs but you'll notice just how bad the plot is, how bad the cast is and how little value you can get from The Lost World. You'll be disappointed eventually.",The Lost World - Jurassic Park
263,JAM-31,Steven Spielberg's Worst Film?,3,10 October 2000,"Steven Spielberg is my favorite director.  I have loved almost everything he has done, so I can be quite critical of his ""disappointments.""  I think I disliked ""Hook"" more than this movie, but ""Hook"" wasn't pretending to be anything more than a kid's film.  I didn't have a problem with ""1941,"" which wasn't great, but I didn't think it was the huge bomb that many people did.The reason that ""The Lost World: Jurassic Park"" could be Steven Spielberg's worst film is because it plays more like a Steven Spielberg rip-off than it does as one of his own films.  One of the things that the director is most skilled at is inferring things, giving us haunting foreshadowing that will get us lost in the fantasy of his stories.  Examples of this include: the opening scene of ""Jurassic Park,"" where we cautiously await loading of a raptor to it's holding pen, that turns to horrifying disaster, without ever really ""showing"" it; the opening of ""Saving Private Ryan,"" where we sit with the soldiers in a higgins boat, hearing distant sounds of explosions, knowing that immense slaughter is approaching; many instances in ""JAWS,"" where the IDEA of a shark is described and presented without ever SHOWING it.In ""TLW:JP,"" there are countless times where we move to an extreme close-up of Ian Malcolm (Jeff Goldblum), where he realizes that something is wrong, and says something like, ""Run... as fast as you can,"" while we are supposed to anticipate something.  We don't.  Nothing more than we have already seen, anyway.  When the group of hunters are trying to escape the island, there is a moment when they realize a certain danger they will face.  ""Raptors,"" a character says, followed by an echo of their growls; No chill down my spine. Almost every time the movie tries to instill fear and fantasy inside us it fails, as if it was directed by a novice movie maker who is trying to imitate Spielberg.The movie also has huge plot holes and many unbelievable elements; a character who tries to be good, and ""save"" a T-Rex from death by replacing a hunters' bullets with tranquilizers is the main reason the animal later runs wild on the mainland.  I didn't buy the ""pack hunting"" of the Compy's, and I didn't really like the scene where they kill a victim.This isn't a horrible movie, and it does have it's moments, but none of them are spectacular.  The special effects are very good, but they haven't improved much since the first movie (4 years before), and they aren't ""groundbreaking"" like they were in ""JP.""  Pete Postlethwaite's ""Roland Tembo,"" like ""Muldoon"" in JP is one of the two movies' best and most believable characters.  He has the best story line, where he wants to hunt down a T-Rex.  However, when the moment finally comes, it turns into a disappointing, wimpy climax.  It could have been the greatest scene in the whole movie--how did Spielberg miss this opportunity?  I think he wanted to save the T-Rex's best moments for the finale on the mainland.  But the San Diego sequence, while ""different"" from the rest of the two movies, isn't very good.  I read the sometimes very talented Crichton's novel before this movie came out, and it was pretty bad--just a quick way for him to make a buck.  It seems like Spielberg was unfortunately thinking the same thing this time, and directed the movie on autopilot.  Grade: C-",The Lost World - Jurassic Park
264,captnemo,What a mess,5,8 January 2001,"How much I looked forward to this film I can't say. I read the book and found it to be not as good as Jurassic Park. (Nothing could have been as good as the Jurassic Park novel is.) I still think a terrific film could have been made. Unfortunately, nothing is terrific in this film except the dinosaurs. Everything else is lousy, including the direction. Spielberg has lost his edge as a director. No longer is he interested in making daring, logical films. This comes off as a live action PC game. No one thinks rationally. No one acts rationally. Characters exist solely to use some talent they possess later on (the daughter). ""Experts"" in their field can't do a bloody thing out in the field. Things happen for no reason that it's ""Cool,"" such as the crew of the Venture getting their hands bitten off by something on board (and it wasn't the T-Rex.) I could go on and on, but I'll let an expert get his two cents in. Please copy and go to this link:  http://www.jabootu.com/lostworldnugget.htmThis is an hilarious and accurate review that brought tears to my eyes as I read it.

The dinosaur is then shown safely put asleep in the cargo hold, before waking up and going out to wreak havoc in the city. The sudden drop in the quality of the script goes on as one gets to see several instances of overacting from the actors playing the stunned citizens, as well as stereotypical chaos scenes.Luckily, the sequence is only about fifteen minutes long, so the aforementioned flaws are just a minor distraction in an otherwise perfectly enjoyable movie that never really feels too long in relation to its two-hour running time.",The Lost World - Jurassic Park

The '90s effects are okay for the era. Even the worst aspects of this film don't really bother me too much. Like the story and having Jeff Goldblum play this movie's main character? Yeah. That doesn't bother me that much. I mean the San Diego scene did feel more like a Japanese monster film than a Jurassic Park sequel.

270,Rovin,underrated sequel to overrated blockbuster,7,14 August 1999,"People who hate the Lost World but love Jurassic Park boggle the mind. The success of Jurassic Park was based on the novelty of cgi technology--and the suspense of a plastic cup filled with trembling water. It had a poor plot, weak acting, terrible dialogue. I did not expect the Lost World to be any better(and it certainly had some shameless moments, mainly the gymnastics scene)--but it surprised me on a number of fronts. Spielberg was obviously changed after Schindler's List, for he ejected the sugary formula and cutsy children that we have come to know(and I loathe) from his 90's films. Yes, we are introduced to a bonafide Spielberg urchin at the beginning--who is soon attacked by the objects of her affection. And yes, we have a simple story of good v.s. evil(which was strangely absent in JP), but with some intersting twists. Vince Vaughn's character is introduced as a hedonistic photographer, who did his stint with Greenpeace. later we learn that he is actually a member of Earth First--a much more ""enthusiastic"" environmental group.The dinosaurs are presented as animals in the film(unlike the first movie), capable of defending themselves not only from the bad guys but the good guys as well. Petting a baby stegosaurus almost gets one character spiked, and the consequences for mending another dino-infant's human-derived injuries gets another good guy chomped in half. Best of all, the baby T-rex who is the focus of much danger throughout the movie gets to make the final kill! It was little ironic touches like this that warmed me to this movie on second viewing, as well as the cynical and refreshing message it delivered: If a Lost World of dinosaurs or other animals was discovered, humans would surely destroy it if they could. Pretty heavy for a saturday matinee action adventure flick.",The Lost World - Jurassic Park
271,forrestwrs,The Lost World--Found to be Amazing,8,30 May 2007,"If I had to make a list of the best sequels of all time, this would be near the top of the list. The original Jurassic Park movie was good and this one was nearly as good. This is also one of the few films that I believe had special effects just as good, if not better, than the first. Most film makers get lazy and overestimate their computer effects.Acting was fantastic by Goldblum again, just as in the first. The heroine had good acting as well, and it is easy to see why this movie jump-started Vince Vaughn's career.The originality of the screenplay may be iffy, but the quality of the lines written was more than good enough to make up for it in my opinion. (One of my favorite moments in the film is when Ian says to Hammond's nephew ""You know, whenever you try to sound like John Hammond, it comes out as a bit of a rush. But don't worry, they say talent skips a generation so, hey, I'm sure your kids are going to be sharp as tacks."") All in all, I think this movie just barely falls short of the first in writing, but beats the original in suspense. Just plain a good film!",The Lost World - Jurassic Park
272,eternalsea,Very good sequel,7,11 March 2006,"The Lost World is the sequel to the 1993 classic Jurassic Park. Whilst this film is not as good as the original it does stand up well as a sequel. Jeff Goldblum returns as Ian Malcolm. Malcolm has been asked to return to another Island were Dinosaurs have been allowed to live without cages. Malcolm refuses but when he finds out his paleontolagist girlfriend is already there he goes with a team of documentariens to rescue her. However several accidents ensue and they are left stranded on the Island with a second party. The film does not have the all round strength of the first and is far more dependant on thrills and its visual effects this time round. It does however succeed as good entertainment and its better than the third installment in the franchise by quite a bit. The Dino sequences are handled well with the Raptors in the long grass being the highlight of those and quite possibly the entire film. The T-rex features strongly again ( and this time there's two of them) along with a new and nasty little green dinosaur compsagnathus. The acting is'nt Oscar worthy or anything like it but the characters do have some charm and when they are put in danger you care what happens to them which is always a good sign. It does suffer a little from a bloated and anti climatic ending that is funny for about 2 minutes but I wont spoil it for you none the less. I give the Lost World its high rating because it does exactly what it sets out to do, entertain us. So I think its fair we overlook some of its flaws as with any kind of blockbuster sequel they are always there.",The Lost World - Jurassic Park
273,orourkec-292-269155,"The Lost World: Jurassic Park fails to be flawless and to beat the first Jurassic film, but it still works.",7,1 July 2015,"For me, The Lost World: Jurassic Park is a persuasive argument for the continuation of the franchise, and a worthy and suitable sequel, despite the fact that it doesn't generate the same sense of enjoyment as the first movie. Nevertheless, I think that The Lost World: Jurassic Park still succeeds as a sequel to Jurassic Park on a few things, such as bringing a substantially darker imagery to the screen, a stronger (though somewhat under-developed) plot, more dinosaurs and more breathtaking visual effects, and the result is that the dinosaurs are more believable and life-like than in the first Jurassic film. However, these aren't the only things that the second Jurassic movie managed to improve upon. The movie also offers plenty of brilliant, top scenes, such as I DON'T KNOW WHAT YOU CALL THIS KIND OF LONG TRUCK being half run over a high and dangerous cliff by the T- Rex, the T-Rex struggling to fit its big mouth and tongue inside a small-spaced cave from behind a waterfall, in order to eat the main characters, the T- Rex entering its big head through an opening tent and sniffing on the two main, struggling-to- be- silent characters who are in their beds, the bloody attack of many tiny dinosaurs on the mercenary guy, the T-Rex walking in the American streets and more still. The dialog is another very strong element in the film and flows in an incredibly and smoothly efficient way. Once again, Steven Spielberg delivers us a reasonable amount of screen time with two of the fiercest dinosaurs ever to have ruled the earth: the T-Rex and the Velociraptors (I know, I'm doing the same phrasing as in my Jurassic Park review, sorry for that). One of the scenes that I loved in this film is Jeff Goldblum's character's single- handed fight against one Raptor. I loved that scene, because each action part of that same scene smoothly and efficiently brought on the next action part, and the effects worked well there. Jeff Goldblum's character is well written and he moves the adventure forward and so do the other main characters. I congratulate Steven Spielberg and his filmmaking team for all of the positive things I said about this film. Be proud of yourselves gentlemen, really. The movie wasn't entirely well done however. One of the movie's flaws is that a few supposed-to-be-heart-pounding scenes didn't work out on me and that left me in absolute disappointment. If only this one thing had worked, I would have largely forgiven the other faults the movie has and which I am about to talk right now. The next fault is a plot hole and it is in the scene with the T-Rex on the ship. Well, the crucial problem about this scene is that the ship carrying the big dinosaur is seen going full speed at the dock for no reason whatsoever. After this happens, people come on the ship to investigate, only to discover the entire crew dead, and now it makes you wonder ""What on earth could have possibly happened to the crew and why on earth was the ship going full speed at the dock?"". And next, you start asking yourself something else ""Is it the T-Rex that did this, and if so, where is it now?"". Now, the T-Rex looks like the only possible solution for the ship going full speed at the dock and for the death of the entire crew. However, the moment a guard starts opening the ship's doors, what suddenly comes out of this? The T-Rex himself! And that's when the plot hole comes, and I am sure I don't need to explain to you what it is that makes horribly no sense in that scene moment! Whatever happened to Spielberg there?! The other flaw is that the movie fails to be a truly compelling sequel, and like I said in the beginning of my review, to beat the first Jurassic movie. I'm nevertheless glad to have watched The Lost World: Jurassic Park. I liked it and think it is still a welcome addition to the Jurassic franchise. I don't regret having watched it. My rating: 7.0/10",The Lost World - Jurassic Park
274,SnowLeopardMaster,Underrated to the core,9,9 May 2018,"This film is similar to the original Jurassic Park, but introduces some much darker, scarier themes, and the highest death toll in any Jurassic Park film as of now, though this may change with the upcoming Jurassic World: Fallen Kingdom.This movie had more dinosaurs than the original, introducing the Stegosaurus, Pachycephalosaurus, Mammenchisaurus, and Compsognathus, as well as finally giving the Parasaurolophus and Triceratops properly exciting scenes. It's the only movie in the franchise to properly portray herbivores as dangerous animals, with Sarah Harding being attacked by Stegosaurus, a rampaging triceratops destroying a camp, etc. And the carnivore scenes were a lot of fun, particularly the worker village with the raptors.Some people don't like this film because it focused too much on the horror element, and not the wonder and beauty seen in the first movie. I say this makes it more realistic, a properly accurate portrayal of what would happen should the dinosaurs return. The deaths were gory, memorable, and creative, with my two faves being Dieter Stark's demise by Compsognathus, and Eddie Carr being torn in half by the T-Rex parents.

The raptors sneak up behind and snatch someone one by one. Good idea. I liked it. Jeff Goldblum plays a very serious Ian Malcom in this one. He's much different then he is in the first.

278,pulikd,There turns out to be another such island.,6,25 July 2021,"Unlike the first movie, the second one focuses a little more on herbivore dinosaurs and only has one kid, not two kids. That could be seen as an improvement. And that is what it is. Unfortunately, it does not prevent the movie from having the most important events take place at nighttime. Nor does it stop the movie from going insane and using highly unrealistic plot moves. Death scenes deserve criticism as well. For instance, because of how stupid they can be. Or because of the strange tone the movie chooses for how a huge predator eats a human being. It's like you're supposed to enjoy it or even laugh. This does not go for all the death scenes, of course, but it is impossible to avoid mentioning.The visual effects were great again, if not even better that the last time. There are more creatures and they are more mobile, more realistic. The music was also great. They don't just reuse what the first movie came up with, there is new material, strong and memorable.

But what I can't understand is why a lot of people didn't like The Lost World - Jurassic Park. I mean sure it may not be as good as the first one and it has flaws and plot holes and some cheesy dialogue. But I mean even the first movie had flaws, plot holes and cheesy dialogue as well. But I think The Lost World deserves more credit because it has more characters, more action and more dinosaurs. And I also thought Jeff Goldblum did just as good a job as the main protagonist as Sam Neill did. I also can't believe that this movie was nominated for multiple Razzies including Worst Screenplay and Worst Sequel.

281,cartman_1337,Spielberg's worst movie?,5,13 July 2000,"Warning: possible spoilers!I loved the original Jurassic Park (have seen it about 15 times now), so when I heard they were making a sequel I was exited. When I saw the movie on the cinema I realized quickly that it wasn't as good as the first, but I still enjoyed it quite much. The excitement of the very being of a sequel completely made me overlook the fact that the film was complete and utter crap.When I later saw the film on video I started to realize that this is actually one of Steven Spielberg's worst films ever. The directing has many obvious mistakes, and the actors and actresses are all acting in a way showing all of their bad sides, and none of their good. The sequence where the T-Rex is running around in the streets is one of the most lame sequences I've ever seen, and at times it almost becomes funny because it is so terribly terribly bad.The first hour of the film is extremely boring and hardly anything happens, the second hour has more action but it's way too silly. And the film if full of giant plot holes. Like for instance: if the baby T-Rex was brought to the city by helicopter, and mother T-Rex in a cargo ship; how did the crew of the cargo ship get eaten, when the T-Rex was obviously firmly secured in the ships cargo compartment when the ship arrived?All considered: this film is terrible, and not recommendable. I'll give it a 4 out of 10.And now I hear they're making a third installment to the series. Call me strange, but I'm actually looking forward to it. Why? Because they're replacing several of the crew members. New director, new musician, new producers (except Spielberg, who's still going to executively produce) and so on. And they've signed Sam Neill to star once again as Dr. Grant. It was he who brought the first movie to greatness, hopefully he'll do the same thing for the third. I also hope we'll see more of Joseph Mazzello (Tim), who's a very talented young actor, and maybe also the sister Lex, played by Ariana Richards, even though they've now both grown up... The third film can't possibly be worse than this one, anyway, so I'm exited!",The Lost World - Jurassic Park

Dr. John Hammond decides to send four adventure to monitor the dinosaur's lifestyle before INGEN move forward in controlling the island. Ian Malcolm doesn't like the idea and wants to contact the other three members, but before he can contact them, he finds out that his girlfriend, Sarah Harding is already on the island. Now, what was supposed to be a natural viewing of the incredible creatures in their habitats, has turned into a rescue mission with everyones life at danger.I don't understand all the horrible reviews for this film.Sure not a classic film but a great film none of the less.It contains the same stuff JP did and it was still enjoyable viewing.It contained a new fresh cast which was good to see because i didn't want to see the same surviving cast battle more dinosaurs it would feel like Part 2 but no with this new cast i felt that this was a proper well done sequel.Spielberg directs another good hit once again but i feel he did some of the same that he did last time.The directing didn't ruin it but i feel he just rationed some proposed shots of JP and threw them into Lost World.The story was of course well done.Instead of them going back there is Site B where the dinosaurs roam free and stuff.Got to give credit to Michael Crichton & David Koepp because without these two Lost World would just be another cheap lame sequel along with the rest of the crap we see.Star of the film...Despite going through San Deigo and having that great Trailer scene,I am NOT giving it to the T-Rex this time.This time i am throwing a bone to Jeff Goldblum who was the star of the show as he was suppose to be.However credit must be given to Pete Postlethwaite & Vince Vaughn.Those two shone as much did Goldblum.In Conclusion LW may not be better than JP but it is still a very good film to watch.I also recommend this too.Oh and one more thing i have to credit to the score for The Lost World.I really enjoyed it more than Jurassic Park.Well just as Jurassic Park.Grade 87% - A- - ****",The Lost World - Jurassic Park

(Ok, that was too easy)",1,13 November 2000,"The only thing good about this film being made was that it gave the team of ILM and Stan Winston a chance to improve their skills with dinosaur simulation technology, other than that it was a remarkable waste of talent.
I read Jurassic Park AFTER seeing the movie and loved the book. Subsequently, I read Lost World BEFORE seeing the movie and knew there could be trouble.  The book was extremely contrived so I had hoped the movie under the right direction would prevail.  Well it didn't, in fact it went in just the opposite direction.Not only was the film 100 times more contrived, it suffered from poor casting and direction as well.  At times this film is laugh out loud bad, much so it doesn't really warrant any further discussion unless after seeing it, you disagree with me.With that said, watch this film with your finger poised on the fast forward button so you can quickly get to the great effect scenes. My only hope is that the makers of JP III learned something from the story failure of JP II. I'm not holding my breath.Oh, before I let you go...if anyone who has seen this film can explain to me how a T-Rex (the only dinosaur on the ship) got into the control bridge of the cargo ship and ate the crew (left a hand on the wheel), left the room pretty much intact, then managed to get trapped in the cargo hold before the ship crashed into the dock...I'd like to know.

285,jramza-1,Wow- insanely stupid characters just ruin the movie.,4,15 May 2016,"Saw this again with my 15 year old son, who was also screaming at the characters to stop acting so stupidly. The CGI is still amazing years later, and while the storyline is not terrible, the main characters' free fall decent into utterly stupid behaviors resulting in painfully predictable ramifications, just ruins the movie. Jeff Goldbloom is still great, as is his character. But his daughter, his girlfriend, and the assistant to his girlfriend are written to be unbearably annoying. The one smart character sacrifices himself to save the idiots - the saddest part of the whole film. This movie is not as bad as the recently released Jurassic world - but they share a common weakness - stupid characters that are sooooo stupid, we hope for their demise, angrily aware they will survive only because they share the politically correct views of the screenplay writers. Best scenes: 1. A Tyrannasaurus ""tip toes"" quietly (whenever convenient for the plot - down stairs to sneak up on a human. To return to push a camper over a cliff, etc). 2. A girl does an entire gymnastic routine before saving her father from an approaching velociraptor. 3. A whole ship of crewmen is killed by dinosaurs without damaging cabins - no explanation how. 4. An expert states that the Tyrannasaurus has incredible smelling skills and will hunt them unrelentingly, then continues to wear a shirt soaked in the tyrannasaurus' baby's blood. 5.

286,filmbuff20,"A sequel easily dismissed, but worth reevaluation.",7,2 April 2009,"Nine times out of ten, a bad Spielberg film is usually better than most. This film has a bad reputation and is usually dismissed as a less than perfect sequel, but it deserves another look, if only to show how good it really is. Sure, there are plot holes and some bad choices, but those shouldn't tarnish the overall film.So what's the good? The dialogue for one thing is well written and well delivered. Early exchanges between field equipment expert Eddie and lead Ian Malcolm are snappy and amusing (""violence and technology - not good bedfellows!"" ""I would have squeezed a little tighter...""), while Pete Postlethwaite's character is magnificently arrogant and snide. Even Vince Vaughan, deprived of his usual schtick, is not given short thrift. Part of Spielberg's genius is his eye for situational character beats and his way of dealing with actors. If you notice, almost none of his films short change the characters. Hook, for example, is strongest in it's first half hour, in which we witness Banning's family problems and inability to let go of his work. Notice also Poltergeist. If anyone had any doubts as to the answer to the question of who really directed that film, compare the family scenes with Close Encounters or Jaws. Here too, Spielberg shoe horns in those moments.Aside from the actors, the dinos are still breathtaking four years on. Why are these creatures so awesome and more recent CGI (including Spielberg's own War of the Worlds and Indy 4) are so underwhelming? The action sequences still have the punch of the original: Sarah Harding desperately trying not to move on the cracking glass that is the only thing between her and the abyss below. The velociraptor attack. The T-Rex sniffing out our heroes behind a waterfall. All wonderfully crafted sequences. Now have a look at Jurassic Park 3 and see the difference. An entertaining film, sure, but lacking the sheen and quality of a Spielberg film.While the missing Raptor sequence that explains the deaths on the boat near the end provides the film's biggest plot hole and the King Kong homage is a little too much, the film still doesn't lose it's sense of excitement and fun, driving it to a rousing finale.Like Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom (which is much maligned, but I think it's the second best of the series) The Lost World is frequently dismissed, but to my mind worthy of another go.",The Lost World - Jurassic Park

Now don't misunderstand me, I like Jurassic Park as much as the next person. But The Lost World had more depth than the first film. It expanded Malcolm's character, not to mention his past. It also allowed time for more character development on the part of Sarah Harding and Kelly. The emphasis of the film was on respecting nature. The movie carried a theme, for goodness sake. It had a darker mood, which also added depth. Who could forget Roland's infamous line, ""I believe I've spend enough time in the company of death."" Pete Postlethwaite did a marvelous job as Roland, and Jeff Goldblum performed well also. Although some scenes could have been excised, such as the one where a man is devoured by compys, the rest of the film is good. It has the most depth for an action flick that I have seen, and it asks some interesting questions.....For another film that asks even more thought provokers, see ""Pleasantville.""",The Lost World - Jurassic Park

289,sumankumarganguly-454-264875,Lost Potential,7,13 May 2013,"(Reviewed on the basis of watching on video 16 years after release)Plot: Ian Malcolm learns about the existence of Site B, Isla Sorna which was the breeding place of all the dinosaurs of Jurassic Park and they are still flourishing there! John Hammond sends a team, headed by Malcolm to the island to gather more information where they encounter another team out to capture the animals. What dangers await them in this 'lost world'?Review: Steven Spielberg films, as I have learned, are meant to be lifelong experiences which curve out a permanent niche in the viewer's hearts. They take us on a journey of a life-time in a trivial period of 120 minutes. Although I am in no position to comment on Spielberg's filmography; having watched just two other masterpieces of the maestro: Jurassic Park and Jaws. But those two films were exactly that- lifetime experiences! Sadly, 'The Lost World' hardly falls in that category.Sequels always have the burden of expectations (especially if the original is a near-perfect classic like Jurassic Park); but one expected better than this. Spielberg himself had requested Michael Crichton to write his literary sequel on which this film sequel is based. It seemed inexplicable as to why the mesmerizing Allan Grant, hero of the original, was replaced by Ian Malcolm who hardly featured in the second half. Crichton possibly felt it unjustified as Malcolm had a more heroic role in his novel and decided to give him his due here (by even miraculously reviving him after his supposed death in the book).The film starts off well promising more thrills at the prospect of only a few people in a dinosaur infested island; with no fences this time. But after a rather tiring build-up, when the team reaches the island they witness the arrival of another team out to capture dinosaurs. Riding on armed vehicles (including motor bikes) they trap the animals almost as a matter of joke. Hunting a jackal would probably be more difficult! The ridiculous ease with which the animals are captured dilutes the whole tension of the film. Even when the animals break-free; the sequence appears more funny than terrifying.Even in JP the real tension had begun post-intermission; but the first half was much more engrossing than here. There the debates, the character interactions and the whole arrangement hooked our attention without much sight of the 'main attractions'. Here we are exposed to a wide range of fauna; but yet the charm is missing with only the Hammond- Malcolm interaction standing out as a debate.Things improve in the second half but unlike just a handful of people in JP; the presence of a large human contingent prevents the generation of much fear (especially having seen their daredevilry earlier). But halfway into the second half, just when the excitement is at its peak, the survivors are whisked away in a helicopter; killing all the tension in an instant. Although more fun was yet to come (thank God!), it was in stark contrast to JP where the excitement had continued to rise culminating in a grand crescendo in the end.The plot has a lot of deviations from the novel, and probably in doing so developed a lot of glaring loopholes. The sequel raises questions about some developments from the first film itself besides having disputes of its own:- 1) If the animals were bred in Site B; then why was the embryo storage located in Site A from where Dennis Nedry stole them? 2) Similarly, it was shown that the velociraptors were artificially hatched in the Site A lab. Was any exception made for not breeding raptors in Site B? Then how could the raptors come into existence there? 3) The lysine deficiency expectedly resulted in the death of all Site A animals. Yet why it didn't apply to Site B was one of the main questions for the team. But it remained unanswered throughout the film. Maybe the script-writer just forgot about it; for was it tough to imagine any explanation like maybe the endemic vegetation of the island was the reason behind it. 4) The justification given by Hammond as to raise public support by furnishing pictures is outrageous. Wouldn't the public be more eager to watch these animals in a zoo? 5) All carnivores were supposed to be in the middle of the island. But in the opening sequence, the compsognathus were seen roaming in herds near the beach. 6) There was no such accident in Site B, unlike Site A. Then why was the radio system along with a bunch of cars left to degrade in the island? 7) How did the T-Rex get trapped underneath the deck of the ship which was bringing it to US, after having killed all the crew above?But the film certainly has its moments. None better, than the tremendous rescue sequence resulting in the terribly tragic death of Eddie. It almost brought me to tears! Plus, the T-Rex chase, the raptor encounters and the ship-crash are the other highlights of the film. There is an element of King Kong in the climax which is good. But is it so easy to drive out a dinosaur within an hour or so? Also, a single dinosaur surrounded by infinite people spells much less fear than the reverse.Jeff Goldblum reprises Malcolm without the old mannerisms. He appears dapper (like a hero should); but the two previous T-Rex encounters have turned him sober from the 'rock-star' avatar, as was described by Hammond. There's hardly much character-interactions this time, except the touching father-daughter relationship.While Jurassic Park was an ultimate cinematic experience; The Lost World is just another good entertainer. But the ending, displaying the dinosaurs with Hammond's speech was masterful. All's well that end's well; but it's still not the end. The dinosaurs will be back; this time with my favorite Sam Neill as Allan Grant; in Jurassic Park III!",The Lost World - Jurassic Park

291,zaremskya-23761,More Dinosaurs,7,18 April 2018,"Spielberg always aims high, very high. His fault, I suppose, as a filmmaker, is trying to make the biggest movies possible, so when they aren't perfect, it shows. The Lost World is a terrific sequel to Jurassic Park, and ties in with the classic rather well in terms of plot and characters, but for a movie chalk full of enormous computer dinosaurs, you feel like there is something missing, and honestly, I'm not sure what it is.Maybe the movie moves too quickly from peace and calm to disaster. Jurassic Park builds up to the carnage gradually enough that it seems more believable and therefore, more terrifying. Maybe The Lost World simply asks you to believe that all the monsters are inches away from destroying the island and not question the logic behind it. Oh well. It's still a cool movie and Jeff Goldblum is just terrific in it, but it doesn't quite live up to the original.",The Lost World - Jurassic Park
292,raidatlanta,"How can this film have a good note, I do not understand",1,20 April 2019,"I remembered from my childhood that of the three Jurassic Park movies that existed at the time, this one was the only bad one. In my memory I had three scenes in mind - all of them were action scenes.Having re-watched it now - perhaps 15 years or so after having seen it for the first time - I think this happened because the plot to this one is so incredibly weak. In french there is a word, ""décousu"", which means ""un-sowed"", like it wasn't properly sown together, and it was just a bunch of ideas jumbled up into fast-paced action scenes made to impress the public. But the actors are terrible, the plot is weak, and everything is so predictable, that you wonder how anyone could have been payed to write it. I feel like anyone could have easily drafter the plot line to this film on their kitchen table, thinking ""Hm, what could happen after the first film?"".I think this film has a good ""grade"" on here in part due to the film being made by Spielberg, and most people wouldn't give a bad note to a big celebrity like him. Maybe, also, it's because they tried to like it very hard, only because the fist one was so good. Maybe they are trying to fool themselves only not to wonder ""why did I lose two hours of my life"". Or, finally, maybe it's because people who put in a good note like films with Vince Vaughn. When I saw he was in this movie I thought ""this is going to be a bad movie, because every movie with Vince Vaughn is a bad movie"". So it was, and therefore, maybe the positive feedback on here only come from die hard Vince Vaughn fans, who enjoy his brand of over-acted badly put together cheap action films.I wouldn't watch this film again unless I were well payed to do so. Everything about it is bad from beginning to end. Plot holes, cheap effects, and bad script writing never stops, from beginning to end.",The Lost World - Jurassic Park
293,laci-5,Good (sorry if I put some spoilers here),8,30 May 2000,"I really don't understand these bad reviews. There are two bad things I could say about the movie.1. O.K., it's true, almost all the scenes are known from the first part or from another movie. 2. O.K., the story is quite stupid.BUT1. It was fun that all these scenes were better/faster/bigger (more T-Rexes, more types of dinos, bigger car falling etc...) than in the first one. This is a basic rule of sequels, right? Of course, there is another way of moviemaking - look at Spielberg's Indiana Jones sequels or his production, the Back to the Future Series, or friend George Lucas's SW Ep.5 and 6. They all did what the best sequels do - doing something completely different on a same high level just with not going too far from the original. JP's sequle tried the other way, I think quite well. Because of the same storyline, you could have expected the end of the film when the helicopter took our heroes - and then you had quite much more.2. The story is not so clever - so what? Even the first episode wasn't too clever, either. But we liked it because it was a revolution in special effects. Was it a really clever, well developed, first class movie? I didn't think so altough I liked Spielberg's style. But almost everybody remembers the first film was amazing - just they don't remember why it was a real enjoyment.But please, it's an entertaining spectacular movie, it doesn't want you to think, only to enjoy it. And it has lots of fun in it. Think of the cut between the first scene and Goldblum's face. Think of the back window of the bus. That was an amazing scene, can you remember the lines appearing at the fingers of Julianne Moore? Or think of when the boat appeared. On the same summer we had another boat landing (Speed2), but that was soo long and boring (I think it took some minutes). In Lost World it was very fast and very entertaining. And the special effect were really awesome.One more thing. You didn't like the script? You can see when the T-Rex eats the screenwriter...",The Lost World - Jurassic Park
294,joeydvdmo,Could have been good,4,12 April 2000,"The Lost World is about a group of people, led by Jeff Goldblum, to go to another island where they were supposed to make a park. Then they realize that their is another group out to catch the dinosaurs, so the group has to stop them.OK movie with fantastic special effects. This could have been a good movie, if they didn't copy off another movie (the movie they copied off of was King Kong). Enough cliff-hanging action scenes to be an ok movie. Beware: the Godzilla of 1997. Also starring Julianne Moore.**",The Lost World - Jurassic Park
295,boo_4ever,Very underrated dino packed sequel,8,14 March 2005,"You didn't have to be a member of MENSA to follow the original jurassic park but it still had more substance then this. However in a way the Lost World improves in areas over it. The attacks are a lot more elaborate and chilling. The scene where the two rexs attack the trailer (with the demise of the hapless driver particularly harrowing), the raptors stalking the men through the long grass, the rex chase at the waterfall etc. All adrenaline pumping set pieces. The overrall theme seems a bit darker then the first film.Thats not to say the Lost World is perfect. Far from it. Malcolms daughter dazzling a raptor with her parallel bars routine before kicking it through a window nearly ruins the entire ending as it is. I thought the T Rex in San Diego didn't fit at all and it certainly wasn't in the book. In fact they left out one of the coolest parts of the book. None of the dinosaurs would venture near a certain part of the island as it was inhabited by a pair of dinosaurs that could become semi invisible like chameleons : the Carnotaurus. We only briefly glimpse one in JP3. Their inclusion would have raised TLW above even JP for me and I was gutted they were left out.Overall though the film succeeded in what it promised me : Jurassic Park only everything with the dinosaurs done bigger and better.",The Lost World - Jurassic Park
296,TobyS,One of Spielberg's few disappointments...,7,31 August 2001,"First off, I loved Jurassic Park, as well as most Spielberg films, but felt that The Lost World should never have been made.  Jurassic Park (both the book and the movie) are instant classics, whereas The Lost World (both the book and the movie) look to be quick cash-in rush jobs.  Did Spielberg have to fulfill his commitment to Universal before he could focus his attention to Amistad, his feature directing debut for his own studio, DreamWorks?  I don't know, but the resulting Jurassic Park sequel doesn't have any of the classic ""Spielberg touches"" to it.  The Lost World is a mish-mash of scenes thrown together without much coherent sense.  The boring scenes were to long (most of the beginning), and the scenes that were exciting were cut way to short (the raptor attack in the brush would've been great if it was extended a few minute longer).  And lets not get into the whole mainland sequences because those just made me wince.  (The Godzilla homages, for example, border on camp.)Spielberg has said that he made The Lost World for all the millions who wanted a second E.T., but never got it (he swore he'd never do a sequel).  I for one wish that he'd made that promise with Jurassic Park because the ""what if"" of a sequel that is never produced is a far greater allure than an inferior one that is.  My grade: C",The Lost World - Jurassic Park

I don't know why he would do a sequel in the first place, for one thats not like him, for two...they always are worse than the original.This looks like it was directed by an amateur beginner. i don't get it. It was good cinematography and things as usual with Steve, but i just wasn't engrossed, gripped, intrigued, as i am with his other films, namely Saving Private Ryan.Jeff Goldblum's character had no spark, no flare, and no enthusiasm, which made him so likable in the first one, and which probably got him a part in this film. That was one big downside.Vince Vaughn was surprising. Very good. Julianne Moore wasn't bad, but i didn't really notice her, so she cant have been too good.I just say, what do you gain from watching this but seeing 24 people die, one by one, and then the main characters live again.

301,Budd-5,Spielberg is lost!,2,7 September 1999,"A couple of years ago the words phenomenon, gifted, and the best in the world were used to describe Steven Spielberg. I agreed with all these. But now I'm beginning to lose faith. Jurassic Park was brilliant entertainment, Schindler's List was one of the greatest movies of all time and Spielberg finally picked up an Oscar. Since then he has hit a slump. It started with the Lost World - the most unworthy box office hit ever, followed by Amistad - dullsville and then the most overrated film of last year Saving Private Ryan. I think Dreamworks is taking up too much of his time.The Lost World is a shambles. If Jeff Goldblum wasn't so damn charming it would be unwatchable. The dinosaurs aren't very interesting, the plot is as basic as it comes and the acting bar Goldblum is barely passable. Spielberg uses every cliche he can think of. A truck hanging onto a cliff. A dinosaur attacking a city. This movie has none of the magic of Jurassic Park. When we first glimpsed the leg of the Brontosauras and Richard Attenborough said ""Welcome to Jurassic Park"" cinema history was made. Spielberg only created movie rubbish here. A big disappointment.",The Lost World - Jurassic Park
302,krational,Beautiful Fantasy,5,16 May 2020,"I was surprised how few people had seen it and even fewer had spoken. Do not know the reason for everyone's silence is what, catch no interest?I don't know what everyone saw, but I saw a stupid, fat woman doing one stupid thing after another with a sincere zeal. For a couple of hours, this bubbling fool messed up everything she could within her power: capering and waving her overflowing love at the dinosaur, regardless of how the other side interpreted it, believing that if she meant well, there was no reason for the other side not to reciprocate; Human hunters were mercilessly trampled and slaughtered, their bodies strewn all over the field, and even their communication equipment destroyed. Finally, she stopped screwing up, because she screwed up everything she could, leaving her with nothing but punishment, starting with the tyrannosaurus rex. The toxic young attendant around her, the self-appointed environmentist, is still in trouble, but the plot did not arrange for his behavior to lead to a greater disaster, or he might not be sitting in a helicopter breathing heavily, hate to look at the anaesthetized t-rex below.All the logic of such fools is based on the preternaturally good fancy, and they are not penitent until they are hard and hard; And even if they finally bump into the fact, the core of them will still stick to their beliefs, either ignore the truth, the scar is not yet healed to forget the pain, or refuse to admit the truth, but have to correct the truth as they think, the result? More disasters. And there is often a good quality in them, which is that they have no sense of guilt for disasters, and that all evil and misfortunes are ascribed to their adversaries; Even more infuriating is the fact that they never have to pay for the trouble they caused themselves, and that the hapless children (locals, rescuers, supporting characters and villains in movies and novels) will take the fall for them, go to hell, and end up cleaning up the mess they left behind.What drives them to do all this is the damned passion within them. They feel good about themselves, with a natural sense of superiority, and look at outsiders with a look of pity and affection. They are happy and content, and they cannot bear to see others' lives as ""miserable"" in their eyes. They were filled with indignation and a sense of mission to save these people from disaster. They want to spread what they enjoy to the ends of the earth, so that everyone can live happily under the same kind of happiness.There is nothing bad about it, but things perfectly will always have a dark side, while the westerners in some common human doing on the dark side of prominent (as we do on other prominent), to sum up, so to speak, probably first, contrary to our ""has no way, never impose on others"", their motto is ""own way, in, once he feel good and you is not the same as his, would have one thousand ways to persuade you agree with him, never admit the existence of other better or at least the same good possibility, which use the means of cunning or rogue range; Second, in contrast to our inclusivity, they clearly distinguish and spit on and even attack pagans, all of whom, against a psychological background of constant wariness and constant threat, are the objects of their destruction (communism?). . In their eyes there are three levels: self, neutral and enemy. Perhaps at some point they would have condescended to save the neutral in distress, but the enemy was no longer a man in their eyes, and they could have treated him without regard for the kindness and tolerance which a man ought to have, as they professed, and would have killed him. It is to be admitted that these historical bad habits have converged a lot, but inside they remain the same. Think Iraq, the Balkans, and the latest hot spots...So they can take a little dinosaur with a broken leg and treat it, but they can't think about it. A creature that can't communicate with you at all can take your baby and don't know what to do with it. How do you react? They can never do this, because they believe that ""do to others what you want"", anyway I am doing good, you will understand me! The result? Shiver to send the good little dinosaur back to the matter, but also pay the fat man with a sniper rifle, for them to hell. So they could release the captured dinosaurs and let the hunters trample and bite them. After all, these people are their enemies, so they are no longer human. It's hard to overdo it (how did you suddenly remember an explanation for why Japanese soldiers were so brutal in China during world war ii?) . So that young brain can secretly change the bald head of the bullet, but also think it is the right thing to do, completely do not remember that he ""saved"" down the dinosaur killed many people.If only the characters and the script, I would not hesitate to give the worst; However, considering that the production of the film is still very good, it deserves 4 stars. To balance it out, I will give 3 stars in my personal evaluation. This review is probably a big hit with a lot of people, but anyway, just be mean, 2 stars.

(spoilers)",6,17 January 2000,"Like most people, I was thrilled to find out that Spielberg was working on a sequel to ""Jurassic Park""; however, now that I've seen the movie I wonder if it was even necessary to do another one.Ideally a review like this would be logical if there was something new or interesting to report on. However, most of the character types and situations here are carbon copies from the first film: The first film had a rainy scene with T Rex - this movie had a rainy scene with T Rex, the first film had kids acting crazy and getting into trouble - this film had kids acting crazy and getting into trouble, the first film had a great white hunter - this film had a great white hunter, the first film had humans playing cat & mouse with raptors - this film had humans playing cat & mouse with raptors.... you get the ideal!Plus the final act ruins an otherwise ""ok"" film.

305,NxNWRocks,Dismal sequel,2,19 August 2007,"This film has a cast of established actors, a renowned director at the helm and a continuance of the very believable CGI that was on display in the first film. Why then does it largely fail, and why is it so inferior to its predecessor? The answer lies in the script and its structure. After twenty minutes of set-up, most of the film involves various characters running around an island pursued by dinosaurs. We've seen this already in the first film, and the rehash here is done without spirit or wit, rendering it dull and mundane. What the paying public ought to have been clamoring for, and been shown much more of, is the paltry twenty minutes at the end featuring a T-Rex running amok in San Diego. It is extremely baffling why a movie that talks so much about the perils of man interacting with dinosaurs shows so little of that interaction in the urban setting of a big city, and even then with only one of the dinosaurs. In fact, for a blockbuster action movie  and a second go-round at that  it is bordering on criminal that they waste the viewers' time with so many ho-hum by-the-numbers sequences on the island.A key failure in this long middle passage of the film is that, besides the always-dependable Goldblum as Ian Malcolm, the principals are playing a number of underdeveloped characters that are hard to work up any real sympathy for. Julianne Moore turns in a poor, unbelievable performance as Malcolm's roving-scientist love interest. Vince Vaughn is miscast as a hired-hand photographer, but does not have much to work with. Postlethwaite stays the right side of over-the-top as a hired hunter, but for the most part the film shows that names and money alone do not make for a successful film.If the feeble script deserves any kind of credit, it would be for giving us a sense of empathy with the creatures, but to be truly invested in a movie, we also need to empathize with the characters, and have genuinely interesting things happen to them. For a blockbuster, it also helps to have a whiz-bang ending. This film has a hugely anti-climatic one, but the biggest transgression of all is its failure to entertain.",The Lost World - Jurassic Park

Without being able to achieve the effect of being in front of something new that had the first delivery, in ""The Lost World"" one expects at least to see more and better dinosaurs and special effects, but the direction of the film disappoints, the dinosaurs seem less real than in the first delivery, the performances are lousy (especially those of Goldblum and Moore), the argument or the adaptation of the same one is badly threaded, arriving to the end of making a Tyrannosaurus Rex was about to be captain of ship ""kamikaze"" with the mission to destroy San Diego. To make matters worse, John Williams is infected by this mediocrity and makes a boring and bad soundtrack.

But still a good movie , and a decent production.I'm shocked about find out, that many people think that JP3 is much better.It's impossible that someone could think like that. I was in the movie theater watching it, and it is completely absurd and boring,at least Lost World has a more exciting ending.JP3 ends, and you think: ""That's it?"".Lost World has flaws, but not as many as JP3, so if you want to see a great adventure with a lot of heart pump action see Lost World.",The Lost World - Jurassic Park

313,jann-6,I like it,9,19 August 2001,"I saw this in a theater in 1997 and I thought I liked it.  I just saw it again on DVD last night, and I now I know I do.  What I can't figure out is why so many people think it's so horrible.   After seeing JP III a few weeks ago, I still think The Lost World is better.  Of course the original is the best, but The Lost World is packed with suspense, witty dialogue (especially Goldblum's), and of course, the usual great looking dinosaurs.  There are a few things I don't like, the gymnastics routine towards the end being at the top of the list.  But other than that and a few silly lines, this movie is almost as thrilling as the first.  Personally, I don't care if the plot of this one is weak.  I've never even really given that any thought.  The first 100 minutes or so are loaded with excitement, then the finale with the T-Rex in the city is, if you ask me, played mostly for laughs. Yes it's like Godzilla, and The Beast from 20,000 Fathoms, but that's the point.  It's like those movies but with 21st century (almost) special effects.  And it's just plain fun to see this dinosaur stomping through the suburbs, drinking from a swimming pool and, wreaking havoc at gas station minimart.  I think if you don't take the San Diego scenes too seriously, and look at it as Spielberg's way of paying homage to *and* poking fun at the Godzilla-type movies, you can appreciate this portion of the movie. Then to wrap it all up with Bernard Shaw from CNN, and an obvious open door to a sequel - what more could you ask for?  Well, maybe a better plot as some people seem to be saying, but I think this is a great popcorn movie and it works for me.",The Lost World - Jurassic Park

315,LessThanPaddy,Weakest of the franchise.,5,29 March 2017,"It goes without saying that TLW has absolutely nothing on the original. JP beats the sequel on pretty much everything, no need to go into why. That being said, I honestly don't understand why this one gets more praise than JP3... JP3 is no masterpiece and once again NOTHING on the original. But, I do think it holds up better than TLW. I even think JW for all it was holds up better too because while it wasn't mind- blowing, it was fun for all it was! Indeed, TLW is by no means the worst film ever made but it is the weakest in the franchise in my opinion (probably an unpopular opinion).Unlike the others, I have no attachment to the characters in this film. Goldblum is much more likable in the original as a secondary character not as the main protagonist. He commands no emotions and you don't feel invested in his cause (whatever it is...) As for the others, does anybody really care about them? Especially Vince Vaughn, I don't see what he ever brings to a film (not even dodgeball, it's made by the other actors). The only actor I appreciated in this film was Pete Postlethwaite's character, and he didn't have THAT huge a part.I do like the heavy T-Rex focus of the film, everyone loves a good T-Rex, that can't be argued. The raptors don't get enough justice in TLW though, they aren't utilised enough and don't have the same terrifying appeal that they held in the first. Also, I won't comment too much on that ridiculous scene where Goldblum's daughter gymnastics a raptor through a window onto a spike... enough said really.I don't like being harsh on this film as I am a big fan of the series. I was too young to go to the original release in 1993, but I can still remember going to TLW even though I was only five years old at the time. I liked it as a kid, but it doesn't translate well into adulthood for me... unlike JP which will always be welcome on my DVD shelf. Indeed, TLW was never going to live up to it's predecessor, and I am aware that most of it is based on the book, but I honestly can't help but think of TLW as an unfulfilled prospect that could have been much better than it was.",The Lost World - Jurassic Park

The first Jurassic Park movie was great, and this sequel tried as best as sequels can (which isn't very much) to be better than the original, but failed. There is no better dinosaur movie than Jurassic Park, and the movie makers shouldn't have even tried to top such a wonderful masterpiece. The effects were somewhat better than the original (the T-Rex looks more realistic). I don't know why they had to change the Raptors' colors! I myself think that green suited the Velociraptors better than orange and white. I know that I've gone on and on about how this movie isn't better, it didn't have to be made, and more, but this movie was decent. I hope that Jurassic Park III lives up to the original, unlike this sequel. 7/10",The Lost World - Jurassic Park

Jeff Goldblum is a terrible leading man in this movie, nothing about him is captivating or relatable and he just feels out of place. Also he has a random African American daughter that serves no purpose in the story and it isn't even explained how he ended up with a black daughter that clearly isn't mixed. Btw he is a jerk to her for most of the film and treats her more like a pet than a daughter, which as a black person, I found a little offensive. The only black character is a child with no substance thats always getting yelled at. In 1997 this movie probably was a little more bearable, but since it's release thousands of movies just like this have been made, therefore the plot just felt extremely recycled and nearly put me to sleep.

This is one of the funniest movies I have ever seen and my sides were aching for several hours afterwards. The T-Rex in the city was fantastic, including the special effects. The DVD shows them without the T-Rex....it's strange watching a bus dent itself.Anyway, back to the movie.....the double cheeseburgers line is pure genius comedy wise, as it the cut at the beginning from the scream to the yawn.One bad note is the inclusion of the kids from JP. On screen for about 30 seconds, they look highly uncomfortable and are probably wondering why they ever signed up for the sequel.Apparently Laura Dern and Sam Neill are back for JP3.

SPOILER ALERTThis is basically about hunters and greedy people hunting the dinosaurs like big game.  That part of it was dumb as a rock.  And there's no scene in The Lost World that comes close to the T. rex scene in the original, where he trashes the SUVs and comes face to face with Dr. Alan Grant (Sam Neill). 
Also, the scene where Jeff Goldblum's stowaway daughter does a gymnastic routine (on uneven bars that are CONVENIENTLY present) was about as dumb as you can get.I absolutely LOVED Dr. Ian Malcolm (Jeff Goldblum) in Jurassic Park I, but he doesn't manage to carry this movie.  And that brings me to an extremely important point--this movie needed the character of Dr. Alan Grant.

""When I first heard that Michael was going to write the book and that he was thinking of calling it The Lost World, I was thrilled because I'm a big fan of Sir Arthur Conan Doyle's book The Lost World. I was compelled by the idea of being inside a prehistoric world that exists today - not behind electrified fences, not in a theme park, but in a world without the intervention of man. I thought, 'Wow, what a great story.' If I hadn't found a story I was interested in, Jurassic Park would have remained just a nice memory for me,"" says Steven Spielberg. However, the bestseller novel The Lost World by Michael Crichton, which is really a great story and the perfect sequel to Jurassic Park, was ""ignored"" by the motion picture producers and the cinematographic adaptation of the original story became a running and screaming breathtaking adventure with amazing visual and sound effects, and an extraordinary soundtrack, but with a little convincing story, completely different from the proposal of Michael Crichton for The Lost World, disappointing everybody who had read his novel. A lost story concerning a Lost World!",The Lost World - Jurassic Park
322,PhilipJames1980,The sense of humor saves it.,7,26 June 2003,"My first consideration when judging The Lost World: Jurassic Park (JP2) is that however flawed the movie is, its dinosaur sequences are really fun, and they delivered exactly what I wanted when I saw the movie on the big screen.
When a movie shows me a guy riding a motorcycle underneath a brontosaur, and depicts the dinosaur so realistically that the stunt looks completely believable, I'm willing to tolerate a jokey script and direction.The talking points on this movie seem to be that the script is bad, and Spielberg's direction of it isn't very good.I'm actually not surprised that the script isn't good, because it's based (however loosely and lazily) on Crichton's not-very-good novel The Lost World, a follow-up to Jurassic Park.  Sure, the book is entertaining, with sequences that should have been kept in the movie (such as velociraptors attacking people trapped in the high hide, and an encounter with chameleon dinosaurs which another comment mentioned already); but overall its story is a lame rehash, its characters are dull and/or unappealing and its action sequences become increasingly ridiculous.Therefore, even when I first saw JP2 in May 1997 I wasn't surprised by its lame plot, dull characters or ridiculous action sequences.  What did surprise me was that scriptwriter Koepp managed to somewhat redeem the ludicrously contrived story by absolutely smothering it in wisecracks: there's hardly a scene in JP2 that doesn't have a humorous line or two, with most of the best ones going to the naturally flip Goldblum (my favorite is ""Increase your rate of climb!"", during the trailer-cliffhanger sequence).While the actors in the first JP treated it more or less seriously (led by Sam Neil, who played his role absolutely straight), the cast of JP2 treats it like the lightweight special-effects thriller that it is: even the solid supporting actors like Schiff and Postlethwaite play the movie straight only half the time, then play it for laughs the other half.  It's a classic case of ""if you can't make the sequel better, make it funnier.""Many people seem to resent that JP2 is such a big send-up of itself, and it's arguably so flawed that not even its sense of humor can save it. Well, I actually don't mind the movie's shoddiness or its lack of depth because it was obviously never intended as a ""serious"" movie anyway.
It's easy for me to hate an unintentionally stupid movie, because a stupid movie unaware of its own stupidity is usually boring; but JP2 is so intentionally, CHEERFULLY stupid (and aware of its stupidity) that I can't easily hate it.Consider the memorable sequence in which several characters run through tall grass and dinosaurs begin devouring them one by one: after watching the sequence, I could imagine Koepp smiling as he wrote it and Spielberg smiling as he directed it, because there is such a guilty pleasure to be derived from watching people being careless and thoughtless in a situation that demands care and thought.One character even warns the others to not enter the grass, then joins them anyway and plunges ahead: scenes of dinosaurs stalking, attacking and eating people are more fun when the people seem to be thinking, ""The dinosaurs won't eat me!  They'll eat the others, but not me!""Despite all its joking, the script is actually an efficient continuation of the first movie's theme that the best possible intentions can produce the worst possible result.  One character is determined to prevent the exploitation of the dinosaurs, but his actions (inadvertently?) cause the death of nearly everyone on the island; not enough people have acknowledged the irony that he was sent by Hammond, who created the dinosaurs and is ultimately responsible for all the deaths in both JP movies.  The best line in JP2 is Malcolm's reply to Hammond's assertion that he's not making the same mistakes: ""No, no, you're making all new ones!""The script also manages to explore the spectrum of human attitudes toward nature: Postlethwaite gives the best performance of the movie as (yet another) old-fashioned big-game hunter who respects the power of the dinosaurs yet can only express his appreciation by wanting to kill a tyrannosaur for sport.  Stormare's character is also memorable because his contempt for the little compsognathus dinosaurs has unfortunate consequences; Hammond's nephew coldly regards the dinosaurs as his products and has no respect for the power of nature they represent (he is not evil merely because he is a capitalist, as some people have argued).So I don't think the JP2 script is bad, or that Spielberg's JP2 direction is poor.JP2 is rated last among all the movies that Spielberg has directed, but I would rather watch it a tenth time than watch Hook again, or Empire of the Sun, or any of the other weak links in the Spielberg canon.
A previous comment complained that Spielberg overdirected the tyrannosaur attack on the trailers: I actually agree, but I believe the exaggeration was intentional.  Spielberg has already proven himself a master of cliffhanger action in the first JP and the Indiana Jones movies; he didn't have to overdirect the JP2 sequence, but he probably did so with humorous intentions.Spielberg is that rare kind of director who isn't afraid to poke fun at himself, and the cliffhanger sequence with the trailers is so humorously and deliberately overstated that it can only be a Spielberg self-parody.  He's a director who does what he intends, and I don't believe he overdirected the sequence merely because he was bored or careless.The other complaint, that Spielberg's use of overlapping dialogue (with several characters talking together) indicated that he was bored with the movie, is answered by the fact that overlapping dialogue is a Spielberg trademark which appears in many of his movies, good or bad.
JP2 is an entertaining and worthy sequel, and neither the script nor the direction is as bad as some people have argued.Rating: 7 (It's worth seeing at least once.)",The Lost World - Jurassic Park

324,kobebusia,"Not as Amazing as The First Film, But Nowhere Near as Bad as People Make it Out to Be",8,29 March 2013,"Let me just say that I am a huge fan of the Jurassic Park trilogy. This one was the first that I saw, and even now, I enjoy watching it. Sure, it's not as mind-blowing as Jurassic Park, but The Lost World is a great movie on it's own, even if there are some noticeable flaws. True, every scene is a setup for the next dinosaur attack, sure a velociraptor being knocked out by gymnastics is beyond stupid, and yeah, Sam Neill and Laura Dern are not in this movie, but there are a lot more positives concerning this movie than there are negatives. First of all, I'm glad Jeff Goldblum's character Ian Malcolm was given the lead, because this time around we really got to know him better and he was a lot more serious, mainly because he knows the dangers of facing these dinosaur, and what they're capable of, and Richard Attenborough's cameo as John Hammond was short, but quite a scene-stealing moment, and one of the most endearing moments from the entire film. The new actors(Julianne Moore, Vince Vaughn, Pete Postlethwaite, Arliss Howard, etc) were good, and this is the only movie where I feel like Vince Vaughn showed how good of an actor he is. One complaint that is just stupid is that people complained that Jurassic Park didn't show enough dinosaurs, but when Spielberg showed more in The Lost World, they complained that it was too much. Now about the special effects, the dinosaurs look even better than they did in the first film, because it had been 4 years, and so obviously the effects would be upgraded, and I know people may disagree, but I really love the T-rex running through the streets of San Diego, and it just brings up the level of excitement. Malcolm's daughter is black, and she's kinda bratty, and I liked Lex and Tim (Hammond's grandchildren) better. They were more fun to watch, and their fear was more believable. Overall, The Lost World is a great movie for thrills and the acting is solid enough to keep you invested, but that doesn't change the fact that Jurassic Park was a better movie, told a better story, and had a much better balance in showing the Dinosaurs as creatures and monsters; while Jurassic Park took an hour to show a dinosaur attack, this movie did it almost immediately in the beginning of the film. Another disappointment is that the Velociraptors are less prominent this time around, but they're just as scary as they were in the first movie. But all in all, this movie is fun and thrilling, and the acting is really good, but it lacks the magic and inspiration that made Jurassic Park amazing. 8/10",The Lost World - Jurassic Park

The actors Jeff Goldblum and Julianne Moore were FANTASTIC! I really enjoyed Goldblum's character Dr. Malcom just as much as I loved him in the first film!

First was the characters (Every time I read a page with Ian in it, I couldn't stop but think of Jeff Goldblum. I enjoyed Goldblum in JP and albeit more somber this time for obvious reasons, it showed a better side of him). Another was prediction, I wondered whether this character who appeared in the movie would have the same fate in the book. Third, the lack of the characters from the novel made it look lonely regardless of the appearances of interesting replacements because character development was minimal (not to mention a blur).The novel had a lot of potential for a great movie. But a remake would sound too premature at this point. JP IV is in the works, too, as I've heard.The Lost World should have been an inspiration by the novel rather than the adaptation. Well, they did mention it was ""loosely based""..oh well. The story was engaging. The T-Rex's stroll around San Diego was great fun. Effects: wonderful.

The Lost World improves in certain ways on the original and yes, it devolves in many ways too. For one, the visual effects are even better. The score by John Williams is terrific, and I must say the overall look is more atmospheric and absorbing than the squeaky-clean theme park look of the first Jurassic Park. The problem is that too much of the film is spent with the more frightening dinosaurs, rather than the calm majestic sense that Spielberg allows the dinos to have in the original for the first hour before he went off and gave us the thrill ride. Also the sequel forgets that what made the first one so successful was that it managed to give us a thought-provoking set-up. The Lost World offers none of that. As an adventure it is above average but as a Spielberg film it is admittedly below par. Still, it can be said that the scenes reintegrated by FOX on TV helped establish more plot development. They helped develop characters and it is anyone's guess why Spielberg had them cut. They are making a third film, so despite what people thought of this episode, everyone will again be flocking to see JP 3 when it comes out.

But I have to mention according to the dinosaurs: Exactly the same ones as in the prequel. Just the t rex and the velociraptors. I mean, not really imaginative.",The Lost World - Jurassic Park

The dinosaurs didn't make an unrealistic impression, the vehicles and equipment didn't impress me at all (judging by their looks they were supposed to impress me.) As far as I can tell there are no huge problems in logic, (watch Timecop for a really messed up story full of holes in logic) then again, there wasn't much of a story to mess up. What probably would have made this movie better was people doing more than running and screaming (they did do some other things but not much else), the movie also could have used some more humor (Independence Day had lots of it and probably made the movie a lot better than it would have been without.)

340,Takeshi666,Jurassic Park III was better than this,6,7 May 2017,"A lot of people love to criticize JP3 for a number of reasons, like repeating the last movie or hyping up the Spinosaur so much but in my personal opinion, I think JP3 captures that ""theme park movie"" feel much better than The Lost World does.For one thing, this is a much darker film. I don't just mean how most of the movie takes place at night, but the while the body-count in the original was merely implied, we never really got to see the carnage - in fact, I think there were only three people we saw dying on screen, and not only that, but there were only four confirmed kills in the whole movie. Meanwhile there are dozens of people slaughtered in this film quite explicitly - not necessarily bloody, but it's quite obvious those guys didn't make it. The deaths in the original film, when they did happen on-screen, were relatively quick and didn't linger; meanwhile, some of the deaths in this film are rather drawn-out and even taunt the viewer with the possibility that the character might actually make it, only for them to die horribly. There's also the aspect of the ""cold corporate greed"" which reduces John Hammond to a bit part, and makes InGen far more villainous than Dennis Nedry could ever dream of being. I suppose there is some conservationist argument that could be made that makes so many of the victims supposedly less sympathetic, but outside of like one guy who faces a very ironic fate, most of them just struck me as guys doing a job and most certainly didn't deserve their fates.Then there's a couple of really gaping plot holes without any good explanation for them that really strike as deliberately done just so the plot could proceed in a specific way, such as a character who gets a whole establishing scene to show us he knows his profession, ignoring a pretty massive Chekhov's gun - and you can't even just pretend he missed it, because he's the one who draws attention to it! So after a lot of plot contrivances and characters acting like idiots, the only scene I actually liked in the whole film was the animal control department vehicle speeding away from the scene, which is still funny to this day. A glimmer light in this terribly mediocre sequel, I suppose.",The Lost World - Jurassic Park

342,a-orourke-292-969653,Smashingly good film!,7,9 June 2012,"My vote is 7/10. That means good. Steven Spielberg continues to amaze me and I really enjoyed his ""Lost World"". I learned that Steven Spielberg is the most famous director of all time and that many of his movies are very good. For me it is very true. For me it seemed that the Lost World movie had better actions than in the first part. It had more ""rush"" if you understand what I mean (more running). Steven Spielberg created very good dinosaurs and created such a peaceful, soft music very relaxing. The dinosaurs I preferred the most are the T-Rex. They are better dino and more scarry than the other ones. I saw the film already twice. The actions were so hard and so powerful. Congratulation! The director is a genius! The actors were also amazing in it. They played very well. The two scenes I liked the most were the T-Rex intrudes when they were attacking people on the island and chasing them through the forest. My other favorite one was the big T-Rex attacking a town in America. My brother didn't really like the movie and thought that it was medium like film. He preferred the first part. Everybody has a different opinion.My opinion: 1 Oscar for best action film, 1 Oscar for very good music, 1 Oscar for best dino,and last Oscar for best director. In total I will add 4 Oscars for it. It is an enjoyable film. It deserves to be seen. Not everyone likes this movie but I enjoyed it. Thank you for reading it and I hope you enjoyed it.",The Lost World - Jurassic Park
343,Dutch90,Great sequel!,9,29 June 2005,"It surprises me that so many people hate this movie. For me, the magic of the first is still present in this one (probably due to Spielberg directing again), albeit not as much, mainly due to the fact that the tone of this one is darker. You'll notice that there are less scenes taking place in daylight, too.The movie has lots of likable characters, one of the greatest being big game hunter Roland Tembo (Pete Postlethwaite), and is an enjoyable ride from beginning to end. The plot is not very strong, but made up for with thrilling dinosaur scenes (such as the raptor attack at the worker village) and great cinematography. Also, the jungle setting gives everything a nice exotic and 'prehistoric' look (as in Jurassic Park).Adding to the cast of dinosaurs from the first movie are the classic Stegosaurus, the head-butting Pachycephalosaurus and of course the Compsognathus, vicious little critters not to be taken lightly! These especially are a great addition, showing that even the small dinosaurs can be lethal predators. And the movie ends with an almighty finale where a T-rex wreaks havoc in San Diego. This scene, denounced by some as 'silly' or 'a Godzilla rip-off', is not to be taken just as seriously as the rest of the movie, as indicated by the many small jokes in it. It is meant to be a fun closure for a thrilling movie.The plot does not follow the book very much, but some of the best scenes (such as the trailer-cliff sequence) are lifted straight from there. The overall story is not dissimilar, but mostly with different characters or multiple characters fused into one. I do wonder why they left Levine out and didn't even create someone similar to him. All in all, I think that book purists will hate this movie. But if the changed plot and characters don't bother you (or if you haven't read the book at all, like me when I first saw it), you're in for a treat.",The Lost World - Jurassic Park

Even though this movie lacked a story like the original it was still extremely entertaining. I though that Jeff Goldblum should have been funnier, and the ending was fun to watch but was somewhat cheesy at some parts. I give this a 5 out of 5",The Lost World - Jurassic Park
346,DeepJedi,An educated critique (contains spoilers).,5,13 December 2000,"I have just watched this film for the second time, this time on TV (unfortunately I paid to see it at the cinema originally).  Firstly, many reviewers here have criticized Spielberg for not remaining faithful to Crighton's book.  The reason for this is because Spielberg knows that movies *aren't* books; books adapted to the screen must be done so with an understanding that *movies* are about movement and colour and sound and many things that a book isn't and can never be.  To reproduce a book exactly as a film would usually be impossible simply for reasons of film running time alone.  To remain faithful to a book is always extremely difficult with the *best* of adaptations (*and* the best of books).  Since Crighton's Lost World was not a classic literary work to start with, I think Spielberg was perfectly entitled to have changed it in any way he felt necessary.  I say this merely to enlighten anyone out there who reads a book and then goes to see a film adaptation of it, and not because I want to excuse Spielberg. One must try to understand the differences between the two mediums and not set themselves up for a big fall by expecting the film to remain exactly faithful to the work it is 'based' on.  However inaccurate to the book it was based on, The Lost World is shockingly sub-Spielberg.  It is a good film if we are to compare it to average Hollywood fare but by Spielberg's own high standards this is awful. In the run up to its release, I had given a great deal of thought to how I would make this film (had I the chance) and I had envisioned so much more than was actually delivered.  For example, I felt sure we would get to see a dinosaur fight (which was staple fare in the dinosaur films I grew up watching), but one that would be so much better for the amazing reality of the new effects that were available; the classic triceratops versus T-Rex rumble!  Sadly, there was very little such fun to this film.  It felt like what it was; a trite, contrived, cash-in on the success of the original, right down to including the original's name in the title (in case anyone was in any doubt about what it was they had gone to see).  As has been said in other reviews here, the links to the first film were almost entirely pointless, especially showing Lex and Tim for ten seconds.  Then there is the cover-up exposition to get around the fact that Laura Dern and Co. had had the wisdom to steer clear of any sequel, and the introduction of a totally unnecessary daughter for Ian Malcolm.  His relationship with his daughter was a cliche, as was Julianne Moore's 'strong ', 'independent', modern woman.  The clumsy plants in the early dialogue about the 'lucky backpack' or revealing that Malcolm's daughter is a gymnast, were examples of 'screenwriting by numbers'.  There was so much in this film that went way beyond my ability to suspend disbelief e.g. the scene with Ian, Sarah and Kelly running around evading the raptors.  These are dinosaurs that can run in excess of 60 m.p.h.!  In the first film (and earlier in this one) we saw the raptors leaping great distances, and killing with deadly swiftness and efficiency.  In this scene however they become all 'stalky' and decide to walk around.  We are even treated to one scene where Sarah races to dig under a cabin wall before a raptor can do the same to get to her and Kelly; what a joke!  The raptor has a huge six inch ripping claw, those powerful legs, etc. versus her fingernails!?  A Jack Russel dog would have out-dug her, let alone a veloceraptor! Why didn't Ian berate Sarah after all he had predicted, had come to pass? It might not be something the audience would have wanted to hear (debatable) but realistically he would definitely have given her a piece of his mind! People *died* because she and 'Mr Green' brought the baby T-Rex into the truck.  What mindless stupidity!  I immediately thought that Malcolm should quickly put a bullet in the baby's head (because to try to argue them into taking it back outside and leaving it would take too long).  He would have blown his top (even more so after what ensued)!  Sure, they have a right to endanger themselves if they wish, but him and his daughter? The *transposition* (for this was all it amounted to) of the action from the island to San Diego was to be expected but wasted; too much movie time had already been spent *getting there* for there to be any time to do the scenario justice.  We were 'treated to' the time-worn gag of the kid telling his parents about what he has seen; the dino ran around a bit, lots of people ran as well; they screamed, cars crashed, the dino returned to the boat.  The T-Rex was an *animal*; it had no character, and until Ian brought the baby into the scene, no objective.  All it could do was wonder about aimlessly.  Thus, what should have been a thrilling build up to the climax, was simply mundane.  No amount of technical wizardry can make up for lack of narrative drive and character involvement.  I also shouldn't fail to mention the now infamous plot hole of the arrival of the boat that brought the beast to San Diego in the first place.  What a shambles!  Neither was there enough blood and horror to do the subject matter justice; this was meant to be a film about the most successful predators ever to have walked the Earth, terrorizing humans.  Big Predators!  Twenty feet high, forty feet long, *eight ton* predators!  When the guy got stomped, he was trodden on *three times* and yet he looked to me as if he was still alive, let alone intact!I think that if you are going to make a film with this subject matter, it *demands* blood and guts.  A bit of blood in the river is simply not frightening enough; and the guy getting ripped in two had no blood whatsoever.  Look at the fear-inducing power of the torture scene in Reservoir Dogs; we actually see very little blood in that but the fear was palpable.  There was plenty of blood in Jaws.  Why not in this?I was so disappointed with this film that I recall thinking how hard it was to believe that Spielberg had actually directed it. Then I saw a documentary in which Spielberg said something that I thought was very revealing.  The interviewer asked him if those he worked with were so much in awe of him that they felt unable to tell him whenever they disagreed with him creatively.  Spielberg said 'no way' - lots of people would criticize him. The interviewer pressed him to reveal *who* exactly, and how they might do it.  Spielberg at first seemed reluctant to answer, and then said that one woman (I forget who he said she was) had said 'I wouldn't want *my* children to see that'; Spielberg then seemed to bite his tongue as if he said something he shouldn't have.  I think this is a clear sign that during the making of Lost World, he allowed others to influence him, when obviously he alone was the creative leader of the production team.  As the man whose filmmaking acumen and instincts have made him the most successful director of all time, he should never have allowed himself to listen to some 'Mrs no-talent' and allow it to affect his judgement.  Of course, he cannot blame such people; he *does* know better than to listen to comments from others less talented than himself, as his past successes prove.It is only fair to mention that the dinosaur effects are sensational; but then we already knew they would be.  However, the only improvements that *could* have been made to the original, sensational dinosaur effects, were very subtle ones, that made too little a difference for them to carry this otherwise weak film; besides which, special effects alone do not a movie make.I certainly do not relish another film in this series.  'JP3' brings to my mind a cinema rule of thumb: few films with a sequel number in the title ever do any box office.  Spielberg won't be directing it and it will inevitably be a botch up without even the quality of effects of The Lost World.  Computer generated effects have already become so overused (and most often misused) that most cinema-goers are jaded to them.  Only a top-notch director and a great, *original* story would have any chance of significant box office success with this storyline.  Believe me, this is not going to happen.",The Lost World - Jurassic Park
347,Leonidos,Wasn't there some kind of book at one point?,2,10 December 2000,"**SPOILERS**One of my biggest complaints with this movie was the tagline ""Something has survived.""  So?  Why wouldn't something have survived?  As I recall at the end of Jurassic Park everyone just evacuates the island and leaves the dinosaurs to themselves so of course something has survived.  Now if you read the book where they bomb the island back to the stone age (no pun intended) it would make sense that everything should have been dead.  Then they go on to tell us that it was based on Michael Crichton's book.  Could someone please tell me which parts?  (spoilers) First of all the opening scene where the girl gets attacked by the compys is actually the beginning to the FIRST book.  What was up with that?  Then when we get into the plot the ONLY character that even remotely resembled his character from the book was Ian Malcolm.  The rest of the characters were either one character's name transplanted onto another's personality or completely made up for the movie such as the ENTIRE expedition that was attempting to capture live dinosaurs.  Then at the end that whole T-Rex rampage through town, what moron thought that would be a good idea?  Another element that never happend in the book.  O.K. I understand that movies are basically never exactly like the book, but shouldn't there have been at least ONE scene from the book included in the movie?  The only one I can remember is the T-Rexs kicking the trailers off the cliff and the kicking of the trailers was the only thing about that scene that was correct nothing else.  One last question: What was the high hide hanging from?

350,AdderCowley,Not perfect but you know what pretty damn good,7,12 November 2007,"The Lost World was a film which had to reach a very high standard. following the impressive Jurassic Park which pioneered the consistent use of CGI and arguably one of film's most symbolic creatures, T-Rex.Because of this a pretty good film was slated. In one sense justifiably so as the Lost World could never compare to the first instalment in the franchise. It was always going to be an impossible task to improve on the first film which had so much going for it and unsurprisingly it is not the best film in the world.In some respects this film does shoot itself in the foot. The end sequence is silly, there are numerous unexplored errors and for the raptor fans, they get a pretty raw deal. Furthermore the Lost World continued on the premise that children would be able to survive a dinosaur attack while mercenaries with guns could not...If you leave these issues aside the Lost World is a respectable movie and no matter how many times I watch it does entertain.What I liked was that unlike Jurassic Park 3, it continued the idea of the dinosaurs being animals rather than monsters. Apart from the Raptors which were just as scary and monstrous as in the first film, none of the animals attack for pleasure or financial gain (compared to the humans in the film). They hunt and kill for their basic needs and instincts. One could say that the film follows an ecological route, and criticises all corporate involvement in animal exploitation.Plot wise, The Lost World is basically an add on to the first film. We find out that there is another island other than Isla Nublar with dinosaurs called Isla Sorna and the now bankrupt Ingen wants to harvest the island in order to ship the dinosaurs back to the mainland. Hammond, who had recently lost control of the company, however disapproves of this and so decides to construct a team to document the animals in order to gain public support for their conservation. He tries to recruit first film survivor Ian Malcolm who initially refuses.However when Malcolm finds out his girlfriend Dr.Harding has already gone to the island on her own he decides to rescue her. What transpires is a 2 hour survival movie full of dinosaur attacks, suspense, action and Jeff Goldblum (Malcolm) attempting sarcasm along the way.While the sarcasm may grate after a while the movie does have some great one liners: Nick:""Hammond's check cleared or I wouldn't be going on this wild goose chase"".Malcolm: ""Well your going to the only place in the world where the geese chase you""Similarily while the plot isn't that complicated the characters are enjoyable. Malcolm is definitely the funniest with his sarcastic one liners (see above). Roland played by Pete Posthelwaite (a surprising casting as I would not expect to see him in a Hollywood action movie) is especially good as the cold, yet human hunter character in the film.The only annoying character is surprise, surprise Malcolm's daughter Kelly, who despite spending almost the entire film screaming and whining about the least bit thing (stereotype teenager), is brave enough to do a complicated gymnastic routine inside a derelict house on rusty bars to kick a Raptor through a window. It is an annoying trait in Jurassic Park that in every film there is always an annoying kid.Interestingly when compared to the book the film is does a good job. Jurassic Park the film was nowhere near as good as the novel but there is a definite improvement over the Lost World Novel in this film. Not saying the book was bad (or for that matter the first film), it was just that I enjoyed the film a lot more. My advice is to watch the film before you read the book. While the book has its moments don't expect it to be a repeat of Crichton's classic first novel.Additionaly the CGI and models come back with avengence!!! As you'd expect after 4 years of development the dinosaurs look better than ever, and still look pretty impressive. Certainly this film has aged pretty well.The moving models have improved as well. Supposedly both T-Rex's in Lost World contained twice the equipment of the previous T-Rex from the first film. Lost World looks great and as you would expect from a Spielberg film, has great production values. Locations look sublime with the coniferous forests, tall grass and no fencing making the new island look and feel like a true lost world rather than a science experiment. Finally I personally loved the look of the vehicles. Certainly this is not a film which will disappoint (or unlike the JP III will confuse you)with its look and feel and as stated before has great production values.All in all, this is a severely underrated film which was always going to be slated if it was not 100% as good as its predecessor. It is not as good as Jurassic Park but the Lost World is definitely a film you can enjoy. Certainly it will entertain you for its 2 hour duration and has always been a personal favourite. So its unsurprising that I was overjoyed to see it move ahead of the disastrous Jurassic III in the IMDb polls. A well deserved result.",The Lost World - Jurassic Park
351,bryan_nixon79,"""The Lost World"" was lost in the screenplay",3,5 July 2005,"Has anyone read the novel by Michael Crichton? His novel is nothing short of spectacular. I wish I could say the same thing for the motion picture. There are only two similarities between the novel and the film: They both have the same title, and the trailers are pushed off of a cliff by the tyrannosaurs. That's it. It's almost as if the screenwriter did not read the novel to begin with, he just created his own stupid story. That is evil. Michael Crichton should be outraged. If the movie would have been anything like the novel, it would have easily defeated Jurassic Park on every imaginable level. It would have been one of the greatest science fiction films ever created. But it is not. It is one of the worst. Don't get me wrong. I am a huge fan of Steven Spielberg. Always have and always will be. He is one of the best directors in the history of film. But, I am surprised that he decided to direct this horrible film. After all, he said that he refused to direct the Jaws sequels because they did not feel logical to him, or something like that. So why did he bother directing the sequel to Jurassic Park? I don't know. But, Spielberg, keep up the good work. War of the Worlds, Minority Report, Saving Private Ryan, A.I., and Catch Me If You Can were great. So Spielberg is nowhere near losing his touch. Anyway, back to the novel. If you have not read the novel by Michael Crichton and you absolutely loved this film, you need to check it out. You will be very surprised.

I wish I had listened to the critics who universally panned it but I mistakenly thought that Spielberg could do no wrong. Newsflash, even Spielberg will do a movie simply to cash in on a good idea and sell a few more lunch boxes and video games.The plot absolutely sucked. It was totally unimaginative and often ridiculous (T. Rex in LA? Give me a break) but what annoyed me the most was the lack of any new special effects. I mean, if you are going to throw a moronic story line at us, at least give us some cool new dinosaurs or a few good explosions. The only thing that was not recycled from the first movie was the plot and I would have enjoyed watching a total rehash of the original rather than this. And what is the deal with the second island? At the end of JP1 the dinosaurs were still alive and reproducing so why did they even introduce a second island?Not only is this the worst sequel ever made but I think it is one of the worst movies ever made.

It's a dinosaur movie, the cast is good and it's entertaining. That's all you need to know. Then watch the others as there isn't a bad movie in the series. I'd say the third movie is the low point but but still a decent movie.

354,myspiderungoliant,My least favorite of the three - which still makes it a decent flick,6,20 November 2007,"I am a huge fan of Jurassic Park. If anything I enjoy the books more than I do the movies. And that it precisely what bothers me about this film.The first point I would like to make against this film is that it starts out by getting preachy really fast. I'm sorry but I am with Peter Ludlow when he says (and it was actually Lew Dodgson who said the same line verbatim in the book) ""an extinct animal that is brought back to life has no rights. It exists because we made it; we patented it, we own it.My other beef is with two of the main characters Sarah Harding and Kelly. I could not think of two more inaccurate transitions from book to big-screen. Sarah Harding comes off as a bit of a hypocrite when, after she has just finished petting a baby stegosaurus, she insists that they are here to observe and document, not interact. That made no sense. And how does a gawky geeky white girl become a black gymnast? The absolute dumbest scene has to be when she uses her skills as a gymnast to knock a velociraptor through a window where it is impaled on a piece of re-bar. The slow swaggering strut that she uses just before she launches herself onto some conveniently placed bars is just revolting. Honestly, would a person act like that when facing down a three-hundred pound predator ready to eat them? Idiotic and poorly done human characters aside, the rest of the movie is excellent. The dinosaurs look even better than they did in the first film. And I don't care how campy the T-Rex attack in San Deigo is, or how much this deviates from the book, it is still one of my favorite Dino vs. Human sequences in cinema.I would still recommend this movie as a dinosaur flick. It looks pretty and is still quite fun.

It was a real favourite of mine when I was younger and having just watched it today, being a young adult, I still enjoyed it. What reviewers need to remember is this: Jurassic Park was in many ways a kid's film. The Lost World has sought to do something similar which explains why I loved it as a youngster.I think it deserves more than simply 6.0/10 from IMDb, but I know why it has received this overall rating. Various people have written reviews of this film which are little more than rants: and then they have given a 1/10 rating, which is absurd. It's surprising that quite a lot of people have done this kind of thing and unfortunately it has taken the overall vote of the movie to just 6.0, when it deserves about a 7.The direction is the kind of thing you would expect from Spielberg. It is certainly not his greatest work, but it is worthy of his name. His direction outshines all the other contributors to this film, even the actors. It is certainly a film you come away from saying: ""Yep! Only Spielberg could do that!""The acting is good: especially Goldblum and Postlethwaite. The young actress, Chester, is also impressive as is the earlier Vaughn. I am also glad that Attenborough plays his part again, as he was crucial and outstanding in the first movie.The story I think is actually quite good. I couldn't follow some of the earlier bits of the movie dialogue when I was younger but today I finally knew in total what was going on. Interesting...The special effects are becoming the slightest bit dated: but they are still special.Finally, the music is very good.There are obviously criticisms of this movie. I do think the film lost a considerable amount of it's seriousness when the T-Rex entered the city. But, nevertheless: it is what we all wanted to see! And let's not forget that a lot of this movie was ""for the kids"". Still, I'm glad the city scene is in the film. I also cannot work out how the T-Rex got out and killed the crew and then got itself back into the vault, whilst for the rest of the journey the ship managed to head straight on target for the harbour without losing it's way: though everyone had been eaten ... But there were some big defects in the original movie too. I have thought about this and I don't think it's such a big deal in an action movie, because all we really want is action. Whether it makes sense is, to some degree, irrelevant. What is intolerable is bad acting in order to simply produce an action film: but this film does not suffer from this problem.This is a far better movie than the majority of films which have been made.

357,billmatteson,"Kingdom of the Crystal skull, anyone?",5,26 September 2015,"I re-watched this for the first time in years and have to say: It's not very good. There are many problems with this movie (watch the cinemasins take on it for a complete list) which I might have forgave when I saw it in the theater, but these issues are hard to ignore on the small screen. First of all, there's the visuals; While the original JP still looks really good after 22 years, some of these look a little under-done, like they trying to do too much with the technology they had available or up the ante to the point that they just weren't realistic. Don't misunderstand, there are some amazing practical effects and once again they meld these with CG flawlessly most of the time, but when they don't it really stands out. Second of all, there's everything else. This movie is so full of clichés and goofy, unrealistic dialogue and actions that it's kind of painful. About 3/4 of the way through I decided to find out who was to blame and discovered that it WAS directed, again, by Spielberg and the screenplay WAS written, again, by David Koepp. What went wrong? I'm not sure, but I do know the is the same team that would later give us Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull. (I really, really, hope these two don't make any more sequels.) There are a some redeeming aspects to this film, top among these is the performance by Pete Postlethwaite. I think I enjoyed the deleted scene of him in Kenya more than I did the actual movie. (Minus the groin gag; Spielberg and Lucas must be friends based on a mutual love of 8 year old boy humor.) The last San Diego part of the film is entertaining, if for no other reason than to watch a T-Rex run around in a city, despite feeling like it was tacked onto the film for that reason alone. (Which, if you watch the making of documentary, you learn that it was.)",The Lost World - Jurassic Park

Jeff Goldblum with a black daughter, the mother of whom we do not meet, is absurd. They even rip off the godawful Japanese monster movies, with the T-Rex stamping through the streets of a major city. The dialog is flip and nonsensical. The two kids from the first JP are prominently featured in the ads and credits, but appear for about ten seconds...this, I suppose to fool the kids who wanted to see them again.

364,jaredmartin-464-711711,The Lost World is a Very Unappreciated Sequel,8,21 June 2015,"The Lost World is Steven Spielberg's follow up to the innovative Jurassic Park, so how does it's sequel measure up by comparison? Well it's far better than most have given it credit for. The Lost World is a flawed film, but it's a film that set out to be different, and not just a rehash of the previous film, something the newest film in the franchise Jurassic World has done. Many seem to like Jurassic World for how it ""recaptures"" the feel of the original film, but by comparison, comes off as a pale soulless imitation of Jurassic Park.The Lost World however, gets away from the theme park idea, and does something that wasn't expected. In The Lost World it is revealed that there was another island called Isla Sorna (Site B) that had dinosaurs that were bred, and raised before being brought to Jurassic Park, on Isla Nublar. The film starts with a wealthy family yachting, and stumble upon Isla Sorna, where their daughter is severely injured by little dinosaurs called Compsognathus that act like land Piranha.Jeff Goldblum reprises his role as Dr. Ian Malcolm, and is summoned by John Hammond for reasons unknown. Ian Malcolm is still a sarcastic character, much like he was in Jurassic Park, but his character is visibly different after the events of Jurassic park, he rarely laughs, or smiles, and Ingen has made Ian a laughing stock, after trying to create public awareness after what happened to him at the park. Hammond is also losing his credibility, after the incident at Jurassic Park, and Ingen has taken control away from Hammond, and given it to his arrogant nephew, named Ludlow, who Malcolm has clashes with.Hammond tells Malcolm that he has been trying to preserve Isla Sorna, and protect it from human interference, but implies that the island is in danger of being pillaged for it's assets. Hammond say's public opinion could keep exploiters from removing the dinosaurs, but that in order to gain such support, a photo record must be obtained, which means sending people in to research, which Ian immediately disapproves of. This is until he finds out that his girlfriend, Sarah Harding a Paleontologists, has already gone to the island. This gives Malcolm as reason to go to a place he would rather never revisit again, as this dinosaur island has no fences of any kind, and the dinosaurs are free roaming.Ian arrives to the island with two other companions Eddie Carr, a field equipment expert, and Nick Van Owen, a video documentarian as well as Malcolm's daughter Kelly (a unneeded character) who sneaks aboard the ship in one of the team's vehicles. Soon they find Sarah, and come across a herd of Stegosaurus, where Sarah has a close encounter when she gets to close to an infant Stegosaurus. The Lost World focuses a great deal on the nurturing habits of dinosaurs, which expands upon the first film, which tried to portray dinosaurs not only as movie monsters, but as animals. This film carries that idea further, and delves into how these animals act in a more naturalistic environment. The T-Rex's also have an infant, that gets injured by Ingen's team. Sarah, and Nick repair the baby's leg, but when the T-Rex's show up, they're less than appreciative, and wreck the trailers/vehicles, believing they have to defend their territory further. This forces Malcolm, and his companions to join forces with Ingen's team headed by Ludlow, but lead by Roland Tembo, played by the late Pete Postlethwaite. Of course since both teams have different agenda's this leads to conflict. Regardless they come together to try and reach a communication center to get off the island. Of course along the way dinosaurs show up, resulting in casualties. After the group gets separated by the T-Rex's, Roland tranquilizes the male T-Rex. Ludlow then want's to bring it to San Diego, where a facility has been built to house the dinosaurs, since the dinosaurs captured earlier were released by Sarah, and Nick. This is where many people are left divided, some liking the T-Rex running around San Diego, and some hating it.There's no denying that the way the T-Rex gets to the mainland isn't well executed, and makes little sense. It also may feel tacked on because it was, the original ending was different, but Spielberg felt the The Lost World needed a bigger ending, just as he did with Jurassic Park. While it may seem out of place, the entire film teases the idea of bringing dinosaurs back to the mainland. Malcolm, and Sarah find the infant T-Rex that was also brought back, and use it to lure the adult T-Rex, back to the cargo hold of the ship, where they both could be contained, and be brought back to the island. Not before the T-Rex causes some dino-damage down the streets of San Diego, which admittedly is neat to see. The Lost World isn't as good as Jurassic Park, but it isn't as bad as critics, and ""fans"" alike have made it out to be. The Lost World has it's issues, such as underwritten plot elements/characters, and unneeded characters like Malcolm's daughter Kelly, but also has a strong cast/performances, and the effects are even more believable looking than in the first film. The animatronic dinosaurs looked even more convincing in The Lost World, especially the T-Rex's that had subtle changes made mechanically, making them much more lifelike. The CGI is also impressive, especially during the Compsognathus sequence that required the animation of several little dinosaurs. John Williams provides another great score for The Lost World, adding more tribal melodies to go with the mood, and look of the film. The Lost World may not be Spielberg's best film, but it's hardly his worst, and it's a decent, well made followup to a film that never really needed one.",The Lost World - Jurassic Park
365,ulyssesgammahose,I'll beat the drum all day for The Lost World. The best of the Jurassic sequels.,7,16 June 2018,"I'll beat the drum all day for The Lost World. For three clear reasons.1. Spielberg. The Lost World isn't prime Spielberg, but medium-level Spielberg is still far and away superior to other directors trying to copy him, as in JP III and Jurassic World. For instance, he comes up with a set piece that doesn't even involve dinosaurs - Sarah Harding on the cracking glass - that has more suspense than anything in either of the other sequels. 2. Plot actually progresses - and provides a good ending for the saga. JP III and Jurassic World just regurgitate the original movie. The Lost World properly continues the story of Ian Malcolm, John Hammond, InGen, the dinos and so on, and then comes up with a worthwhile ending where Hammond has learned to respect nature and makes a paradise for the dinosaurs instead of exploiting them. That's the best ending the saga can have. 3. It's Jurassic Park through a dark mirror. The 1993 original is all bright colours and a sense of wonder amidst the scares. The Lost World is dark, dirty, ominous, and is basically a two-hour rage against the inhumanity of capitalism. Jeff Goldblum's now-sombre, foreboding Ian Malcolm says it all.",The Lost World - Jurassic Park
366,EugeneandSasha,One of the Most Underrated Movies Ever,7,3 November 2005,"The Lost World: Jurassic Park is a very good sequel to Jurassic Park. It is also one of the most underrated movies I ever seen on IMDb. Although not superior or as good as the original, The Lost World: Jurassic Park is a more darker and more terrifying. Jeff Goldblum delivers a very good performance and plays as Ian Malcolm very well. The other actors and actresses also deliver a nice performance and the characters are shown decently. I must warn to any first-time watchers that this movie differs from the book a lot. This accounts for most of the deceiving bad reviews. Some of the characters in the book where used but a lot of characters (Ajay, Roland, Ludlow, and Nick were added). The plot isn't as good as the originals but does make sense and goes a long way. The CGI was some of the best I've ever seen-superior to Jurassic Park's. Excellent scenes include Eddie car being ripped in half by two parent T-Rexes, while trying to save Malcom, Sarah, and Nick, Dieter Stark (an added character) being eaten by dozens of compies, and a group of hunters being taken out by raptors one by one. There are 3 main places where The Lost World: Jurassic Park is weak. The first one being Sarah, Nick, and Malcolm responding to Eddie with a fast food order when Eddie asked what else the needed to rescue them from the trailers. The second being the worst is Kelly kicking a raptor and killing it. The last part, I actually liked (and so did some other people) was the part when the male T-Rex got loose in San Deigo. I personally think this scene was fun and thrilling but also kind of silly. Overall Spielberg delivers a great sequel almost as good as the original that came out four years earlier.",The Lost World - Jurassic Park
367,Ross16,I hate it then I like it then I go back again,8,29 August 2008,"Sequels as most anyone can tell you are tricky businesses. Either filmmakers try to repeat the success of the first one by just giving the same thing but on that ""bigger and better"" scale but it just doesn't have the magic as the first. Or you get into rare sequels like Terminator 2 and my favorite Aliens which surpass the original. Here, it's likable but then you find reasons to hate it. Ian Malcolm has spent the last 4 years telling people who will listen the horrors that happened at Isla Nublar but no one will believe him, including when some big conglomerate bigwigs step in. He meets with Jurassic Park founder and former Ingen boss John Hammond who informs him of Site B, a kind of pre-breeding ground before being shipped to the park. But in order to not have Ingen take the dinosaurs away from the island, he sends a reluctant-but-then-determined Malcolm to the island, especially when news that his girlfriend Sarah is on the island alone. So coming along with Malcolm is Nick, a photographer and Eddie, a field equipment expert and Malcolm's stowaway adopted daughter Kelly. Only they run into Ingen's team who wants to take the dinosaurs away back to the States. After a rather harrowing(and suspenseful) incident, they team up to try to escape the island, which then leads to dinosaur vs. city at the end. Steven Spielberg when he does blockbuster films is best when it gets your heart pounding and gets the suspense going. The raptor in the kitchen scene or when T-Rex escapes are some of the better suspenseful moments from the first one. Oddly enough, there's 2 here. Inside a trailer that's being tipped over a cliff, Sarah falls but hits a sheet of glass which is steadily cracking. The other is when T-Rex pokes its head through a tent cause it smelled dried blood. But oddly enough they're just not that suspenseful as the first. Another thing is that you start to question certain actions. Like when the trailer tips over, all of Ingen's men are there despite the fact 2 T-Rex's were just there. T-Rex's can't hear apparently? There's many others in the film but then you just forget about them afterwards. In terms of CG it's still impressive. Unlike CG ""father"" George Lucas, Spielberg knows how to blend CG with live action unlike Lucas who goes really overboard with CG. Many of the dinosaur shots are actually big ass puppets. But then the next cut will be a CG and you wouldn't even notice the difference. It's more complex then the first but it doesn't have that ""wow"" factor. One of Steven's lesser titles like Amistad or the Terminal but it's still entertaining in certain respects.",The Lost World - Jurassic Park

And Malcolm's daughter is a walking cliche. But what's worse, it violates the rules for sequels. It's not new, in any way (except to show us new dinosaurs, like the stegosauruses or the pterodactyls (pteranodons? either way, just how did Hammond intend to exhibit THEM? No roofs on Jurassic Park as I recall...), and it actually contradicts the original. For instance, Hammond flat out told us that EVERY dinosaur in the park was hatched in his lab under his personal supervision. So what's with this island? Again, the kids in JP did not act like children of the father JP:TLW showed us; they very definitely expected adult men to take care of them. ""He left us! He left us!"" cried Lexie in complete betrayal; that girl's father was around. So what happened? Another? How about the man who was ""always on the lookout for another future ex-Mrs Malcolm"" being presented to us a committed boyfriend? For that matter, Malcolm was the least likely person from JP to be the hero. And the whole ""T Rex in California"" bit ... doesn't work.

The actors chosen were no problem to me and I think the book is better because It goes more in depth as to what led to the great expedition. See Jurassic Park 3 and you will see why it is better.

376,dudelebowskii,Stop the tape once they leave the island,7,30 October 2004,"SPOILERS The original 'Jurassic Park' film was released whilst I was in my final year of primary school (age 11-12). It was my favourite film for ages. And now at 19 years of age, although it may have been replaced at the top of my film list, I love it just as much. It is an epic film and the T-Rex breakout scene is one of the best of all time.So when I was sat in the cinema screen awaiting the start of this sequel I was, naturally, extremely excited. It was never going to be as effective as the classic first film (and it certainly isn't) but for 2 thirds it is entertaining and engaging action fare.It was a clever idea to upgrade Goldblum's Ian Malcolm from bit part player to central protagonist. He was easily the best character in the first, possibly the only person with character in the first, excluding the dinosaurs. His witty dialogue was a joy ('It's an impact tremor is what it is, I'm fairly alarmed here!) and here we are given the opportunity for plenty more humorous lines. Actually, the human characters in this film do, in general, have more personality. The one true flaw you can accuse the original of is the dullness and lack of development of the characters. Laura Dern is replaced by the much more capable Julianne Moore as the leading lady in this sequel, and the under-developed Sam Neill character was rightly left out.The result is a much more light-hearted perspective of events on this new island, as Goldblum's witty repartee illuminates the dangerous dinosaur scenes. And it becomes a very good action film. The stars of the first, the Rapters, take a back seat for the T-Rex and the small but deadly little green ones to steal the limelight. However the rapters in the long grass sequence is probably the best scene in the film.But as soon as they manage to escape the island this film franchise lost all it's appeal. The T-Rex in the big city ending is atrocious. It makes a mockery of the dinosaur as we see him chasing buses, drinking from swimming pools and chewing on dog kennels! After one and a half films of gripping, edge of the seat dino action this ending is a total joke. I still don't know what happened to the crew on that ship. I just sat there shaking my head at this typical Hollywood over-the-top scenario.And then there is the third film. Possibly the worst film of all time. Spinosaurus! Swallows a mobile phone! Rapters talking to each other! Oh please! Spielberg didn't direct it and you can tell. Something tells me he was regretting that abysmal ending to 'The Lost World' (an apt title, as the climax to this film marks the end of a geniusly created dinosaur world).

I liked the ending, but they could have done more with it, I think. It was exciting though, and still very underrated. If you like T-Rex, go see it, because he has around 45 minutes of screen time. I will also say, this is the most exciting of the 3. All in all, this may not be the best one in the trilogy (the first one has a magnificent story), but it is by far the most action packed, has the best CGI of any movie iv'e ever seen, is a lot of fun, is comical, and my favorite of the 3.9.5/10",The Lost World - Jurassic Park

Malcolm goes down to bring her home before she is eaten. While there, another group from Ingen arrive to hunt and capture as many species of dinosaurs as they can to turn them into a travleing sideshow. Once again the effects are tremendous and I don't really understand some people's complaints that the story isn't good. I didn't see anything wrong with the basic concept. It's not as good as the first movie because you don't have Sam Neill and Laura Dern and you don't have that same awe as the first time you laid eyes on the dinosaurs trying to put yourself in the place of the paleontologists.

Great effects just isn't enough.One part in particular that really stands out as unnecessary long and just plain annoying is in the middle of the film when the main characters are captured in their bus-like vehicle. I don't think there's anyone on the planet who can't figure out they're all gonna make it (except for the guy who conveniently comes to their rescue) and yet Spielberg's gotta milk every tiny little second he can out of that single scene, delaying it several minutes, and for what? To achieve a state of suspense...well mission accomplished...not! *sigh* Perhaps this movie where to gain if he had shortened it down, but it still wouldn't have been great, and perhaps not even good, but at least more acceptable. While the first movie was quite original and entertaining this one lacks in almost every aspect of film making. There are so many predictable elements and boring characters that it's just not interesting to watch. I actually mostly saw the whole thing, to have seen it and now I feel I could easily live without that experience. To me this is just a cheap trick to milk out more money from an originally great concept. I haven't seen the sequel to this one, and don't think I will either.At last I would just like to say that I'm usually not this pessimistic, and I don't aspire to be, but this is just my take on the film.

I don't care what other people say.In this movie we find out that the dinosaurs from Jurassic Park were not cloned on the same island. In this film the main protagonist is Ian Malcolm who was a side-protagonist in Jurassic Park. Here we learn more about his daily life.The whole movie was just OK, but what saved it for me is when the T-Rex came to the city and started rampaging through it.8/10. Not better than Jurassic Park, but is still great non the less...",The Lost World - Jurassic Park
387,rctguy75,A Wrongfully Hated Movie!,9,1 February 2017,"In 1993, Steven Spielberg's movie Jurassic Park premiered to overwhelming success. The film received 3 academy awards, and is now considered one of Spielberg's best films. With the success of Jurassic Park, there was obviously hype for Spielberg to make another movie. With that in mind, then came The Lost World.While the original Jurassic Park film opened to great criticism and box office records, the second film in the series was universally bashed by everyone. Much like Spielberg's other sequel, Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom, no one seemed to like it. Even to this day, I never understood why this film was hated. So let's dive into The Lost World Jurassic Park.The story of the film goes like this. After a rich family comes across the island Isla Sorna, their daughter is injured after encountering a group of Compys. The new CEO of Ingen, Peter Ludlow, attempts to use this incident as help for his mission to bring these dinosaurs back to San Diego. However, John Hammond is trying to preserve the island from all intruders by rallying the support of public opinion. In order to do this, he is planning to organize a team to get a complete photo record of the dinosaurs. He already recruited Eddie Carr, the technician, Nick Van Owen, the photographer, and Sarah Harding, the scientist. However when he learns that Sarah is part of the team, Ian Malcolm joins the group only to bring back Sarah, who is already on the island. The team arrives on the island, finds Sarah, and find Ian's daughter Kelly stowed away on their trailer. The Ingen team arrives soon after and attempts to capture the dinosaurs. However, when Ian's group tries to help an injured baby T-Rex, the parents destroy their trailer and kill Eddie. The two groups meet up, and working together, head towards a communications center on the island. However, a pack of Velociraptors ambush the group and kill almost everyone, while the two T-Rexes continue to follow them. Once they escape from the island, a T-Rex escapes custody and runs rampant through San Diego. After the T-Rex is returned to the ship, it is sent back to the island. Overall, I like the story of the film. It has plenty of likable characters and the idea of preserving the island was good.Most of the characters in the film are great. Ian Malcolm has a much bigger role and his dynamics with all the other characters are good. He has favorite personal line in the film: ""Oh yeah ohhhh ahhhh, that's how it all starts. And then later there's running, and uh screaming."" Both Sarah and Nick get some pretty good lines as well. The Ingen guys are mostly good, especially Roland Tembo. He also has one of the best lines in the film: ""I've spent enough time in the company of death.""The special effects in this movie are just as good as the first film. There is a perfect mix of practical animotronics and CGI, and the T-Rexes get a pretty good amount of screen time. The Raptors going through the long grass picking guys off is great, as is the trailer hanging off of the cliff. In fact, the T-Rex trailer scene in the film might be one of the best scenes in the entire franchise.However, there are two negatives that I have with this movie that keep it from getting a 10. First off, the scene were Kelly uses her gymnastics to kick the Raptor out the window is pretty stupid. The following line from Ian almost made it work: ""The school cut you from the team?"" Finally, the T-Rex San Diego scene is also pretty stupid. While the CGI in this scene is mind-blowing, the idea of the scene is very out of place compared to the rest of the film. Not to mention, it is very much ripping off King Kong.Despite these few negatives, The Lost World Jurassic Park is a very underrated sequel that is very wrongfully hated. The characters are good, the story is different, and the special effects are fantastic. While not nearly as good as the original Jurassic Park, The Lost World is a very good sequel that, in my opinion, beats out Jurassic World. The Lost World Jurassic Park gets a 9/10!!!",The Lost World - Jurassic Park
388,Amblin,YOU try topping the $913 million 1993 blockbuster!,6,7 April 1999,"I must admit, after viewing The Lost World I felt like I had just experienced a below-par Steven Spielberg film. But, I DO NOT blame him, for the creative genius is at work in this film. The main reason the failure of the movie is the story. A clear indication was given that Michael Crichton was probably pressured into writing a sequel novel just for the sake of another movie. The story seems very rushed, sort of a last minute job. It was going to be hard to top 1993's original hit, so you can't really expect it to be better. The Lost World has its moments as the Spielberg touch is there, such as the raptors creeping up behind the party in the long grass.....but there are so little moments of coolness that you'll think this is just regurgitating the 1993 flick's ideas. The visual effects have improved since 1993, so the dinos (especially the raptors) have much greater movement, which can look good.....but the terror isn't there. The original movie was quite frightening (much like Jaws), but this sequel isn't quite as frightening. It's more like a CG feast. But overall, Spielberg tried with what he had, and got a less than average response. When you have a blockbuster that was as big as Jurassic Park was in 1993, it's extremely hard to top it.",The Lost World - Jurassic Park
389,Tapio-5,Simply awful sequel to a stupid movie,1,7 May 1999,"Well, I think that Jurassic Park gets more awful when you see it many times. This sequel is worthless and even the effects don't make a ""wow2 effect, actually the effects are quite bad. In the beginning film credits are like from some stupid finnish movie. The plot is awful and the end where the dinosaur goes ´to city is very poorly done and stupid. Actors, well are ok. There's scenes which are too long, especially where the car is falling from a cliff, its too long scene. I watched this from video and I got very tired and I almost slept. Spielberg is a good director, but he should give up making this kind of movies and do movies like his others great films: Schindler's List and Saving Private Ryan. I would give this * star out of ***** (1 out of 10).",The Lost World - Jurassic Park
390,wedaniel-2,A Great Sequel to a Great Film,10,12 January 2002,I have to disagree with the average vote for this movie.  I recently rewatched Jurassic Park: Lost World on DVD and the film was fun.  It's very difficult to make a sequel that holds up.  I believe that Spielberg hit the mark as he often does.  This will be the second time I watched this movie since its theatrical release on DVD.  I thought it was great then (1997) and just as much fun now.If you like action films with a bit of science-fiction this film is a must.,The Lost World - Jurassic Park
391,the_shadow_guard,Takes itself too seriously,2,23 December 2003,"*Spoilers* The visual effects and the idea behind the movie were as good, if not better, as the original Jurassic Park.The actual characters and the plot, however, weren't. Here's something that stood out: a baby T-Rex is injured, and so Dr. Sarah Harding (Julianne Moore's character) decides that taking it over to the trailer to fix its leg is the best thing to do. Vince Vaughn's character doesn't really seem to mind; he just helps her. Earlier in the film, Sarah said she was sure she can prove that father T-Rexes, as well as the mothers, care for and protect their young. Therefore, why does she not stay as far away from the baby T-Rex as possible? Even if she is suicidal, which she isn't, does she not remember that not only is her new assistant, her boyfriend Malcolm, and his daughter on the island, but so are other people. She's putting everyone around her in danger just so she can nurse the animal. Sorry... human lives really aren't worth one T-Rex.The result? Sarah, her boyfriend, and her assistant all nearly die when the adult T-Rexes push their trailer over a cliff. Instead, the man who keeps persisting in trying to pull the trailer back with a rope attached to his car, even when T-Rexes come and surround him, is then ripped apart. Way to go. Yet the only time this is discussed in the movie is when Malcolm asksthe ""real"" villain not to refer to the T-Rexes as ""feeding,"" as this would dehumanize the man's sacrifice of his life. But did Malcolm bother to yell at his girlfriend for being, well, a little less caring about other people? The movie took itself and its attempts at morals a little too seriously.",The Lost World - Jurassic Park
392,metroidphazon4,totally underrated! this movie is awesome!!!,9,15 November 2010,"let me get one thing clear. this movie is awesome for 3 reasons. it has a very well written story line, there are even more dinosaurs and its even more intense than the first one.there are a couple flaws though: one of the scenes was sort of copied from the first film and Dr.Grant and some of the other beloved characters were not in this one. the story takes place on the breeding island of Jurassic park where two teams are sent to the island to study the creatures.One team though wants to capture the dinosaurs and take them to a Jurassic park thats going to take place in san Diego.The movie really is great and worth a watch or 7 for Jurassic park fans everywhere.Its just another exciting Jurassic park adventure for the whole family!",The Lost World - Jurassic Park
393,raiderreggid,"A decent ride, but filled with too many stupid people behaving stupidly",5,6 February 2013,"A decently fun adventure ride, but other than the character played by Jeff Goldblum and a couple others, this film is filled with some the stupidest supposed ""scientists, ""business people,"" and ""hunters"" ever to walk the earth. Obviously, a film about dinosaurs requires a massive suspension of disbelief, but that doesn't mean most of the characters should be completely incompetent imbeciles. With countless billions of dollars at stake, InGen sends ONE intelligent guy, Pete Postlethwaite's character, but sends him with dozens of incompetent, mindless fools for support? And Julianne Moore's main character? WORST. SCIENTIST. EVER. She spends half the film annoyingly preaching about not interfering with nature, yet the other half interfering in the most obvious and worst possible ways. She professes to be an expert at tracking and avoiding predators, yet does everything possible to make sure the predators know exactly where she is? Ugh -- her character is truly cringe-inducing.So, while the movie is kind of fun, it's only fun if you turn off your brain. A late-night or ugly- weather film. 5/10.",The Lost World - Jurassic Park

I've been an incredibly avid fan of all things dinosaurs since I was a kid. I remember seeing the first JP movie at the drive in when I was 6, and was blown away by it. I saw this one in theaters opening weekend, and part 3 in theaters opening weekend as well. The third movie doesn't even hold a candle to the first two. This movie, although not as perfect as part one, is still an incredible film. Blended with some comedy, this is an action packed dinosaur thrill ride! Plenty of T-Rex moments and great finale. Two thumbs up.",The Lost World - Jurassic Park
395,Samtheshrikker,You'll have to make up your own mind...,8,2 August 2014,"Following up the huge success of Jurassic Park was never going to be easy, but The Lost World manages to pull it off. Jeff Goldblum thankfully resumes the role of Dr Ian Malcolm, and Richard Attenborough also reappears as John Hammond (albeit briefly). While Jurassic Park was seen by many as a stalwart family film, Spielberg took a different direction with The Lost World in making it a darker suspense/thriller movie. This is seen even in the character progression, as Goldblum's Malcolm in this film is notably more sceptical and cynical than in the original. Julianne Moore and Vince Vaughn both step up well to the main cast, although one of the film's strongest performances comes from Pete Postlethwaite (playing Roland), who lights up the pockets of screen-time in which he features. As in the original, Spielberg pays great attention to the dinosaurs themselves, with superb CGI and animatronics back in full force to make the dinosaurs seem well and truly alive. Ultimately, The Lost World is disputed among viewers. Some claim it's a strong and worthy sequel that builds on its predecessor. Others argue it's not quite as gripping or memorable as the original.

The movie starts off promising, but after the first action sequence, the only good one in the film, it goes down hill quick. The suspense of the first movie is replaced by very bad action. The excellent sequence in the first movie where the protagonists have to stay still to avoid the attention of the T-Rex is redone in a completely unoriginal and worse fashion. The dreaded rapters from the first movie seems to take out extras with ease, but can't touch the main characters, even two on one.

401,Gryosphere,"Great sequel, but the third best in the series!",10,24 October 2001,"The Jurassic Park Trilogy is my favorite movie franchise. As much as I love each Jurassic Park movie, this is the third best in the series. Jurassic Park will always be the best in the series, since it is the original. When I saw The Lost World: Jurassic Park, I thought it was the best sequel ever made, until summer 2001, when Jurassic Park III was released. Don't get me wrong, The Lost World: Jurassic Park is a great movie, and one every one should see. The Lost World: Jurassic Park takes place 4 years after the incident on Isla Nublar. Ian Malcolm is heading back to Jurassic Park, but not the same island. As we discover Ingen has two islands, Isla Nublar, and Isla Sorna. Isla Sorna was used to breed the animals and nurture them for a few months and then move them to the theme park on Isla Nublar. After the incident on Isla Nublar, a hurricane wiped out Ingen's facilities on Isla Sorna (Site B). Ian and his team is in the race against time, as Ingen is planing to take the dinosaurs off Isla Sorna, and take them back to the mainland to show them off for profit. Soon, disaster strikes the teams, and they are forced to team up to try to make it off the island alive. They finally get off the island, but little does Ian and his group know that Peter Ludlow (John Hammond's nephew) is taking a live T-Rex back to San Diego, to add it to the new park, Jurassic Park: San Diego. One thing leads to another, and the T-Rex is on a rampage in downtown San Diego. Can Ian get the T-Rex back on the boat and send it back to Isla Sorna?

403,Kyle007,What an adventure!!!!!!!,10,8 March 2005,"Wow, this is the first Jurassic Park movie i saw and i have to say it really blew my head, it was just great, i had an incredible moment in the cinema that day, one of the best i have had in a cinema.Somebody said in other comment that there was no chemistry among the characters, bah, that's a big lie, they had a relation very funny and did really fit in the story, and the product of their relationship was really amusing. The actors did a great job and gave the characters a really definite personality, for example, Ian Malcom (Jeff Goldblum) was the whole movie complaining of everything he could and was always ill-humored, Sarah Harding (Julianne Moore) was an adventurer-paleontologist that really wanted to change her life of bones digging out, Nick Van Owen (Vince Vaughn) was photographer that only worked for acknowledgment.......and money, of course......and so, if you mix them up you get an eccentric and funny mixture. Richard Attenboroughplayed a short but nice part in this movie.The script was really good despite of all those here that think not, it had a great plot and had a lot of funny lines, specially for Jeff Goldblum, and i couldn't help laughing, the jokes are very very smart, not cheap ones.The special effects are a subject apart here in this movie, i think this movie has the greatest of all time and haven't been excelled yet. The dinosaurs seemed alive and more (the first time i saw it i thought they were real, i was a kid then, don't get me wrong, i knew dinosaurs were extinct, but i just couldn't think this was a product of computers) The scene when the In-gen team arrives to the island and they chase the dinosaurs is worthy of admiration and it's not the only one.The music is the classic from the first, and so, it couldn't be better. It could adjust to scare tunes, to fun and adventure ones.Spielberg did a great job with this movie better than with the first one, this is the best of all until now, let's wait for the forth movie and expect it will be as good as this, let's hope so.So resuming, this is one of the greatest movies that i've seen, (and i've seen lots) and should have a rating much superior than it has now, come on, you have to be fair.......",The Lost World - Jurassic Park

Malcolm did NOT need to have a daughter, there did NOT need to be two teams (though Roland was one of my favorite characters in the piece.), Ingen did NOT need to come in strip mind the place, some of the original characters and story lines could and SHOULD of been shown, and last but not least the entire sequence in San Diego with T.Rex could of been cut or made a heck of a lot shorter, though the scene with the little boy seeing big Rex was very funny. It just these little thing that gripe when should have been enjoying.Despite it short comings, the film was just as good visually as it was the first time around, Golblum surprised me where he took the character of Malcolm, not being the smart cocky Mathematician that he was in Jurassic Park, turning him into somewhat more darker and fear filled man (who would NOT after surving the ordeal he did) but still have dry witty humor that audiences loved about him.Also the spirit of the first film is very much there, a survival man vs. nature piece, sort of magnified seeing how this band of explorers and hunters do not have a park security system or a team of techies backing them up and knowing that this place is the dinosaurs home and they are the intruders.Though not being the ground-breaker is predecessor was, the lost world will entertain audiences, I mean come on, everybody loves a baby T.Rex :)",The Lost World - Jurassic Park

The Lost World: Jurassic Park, wasn't well perceived however I believe that Jurassic Park 3 has made many people appreciate this movie more. Overall, despite JP 3, I still think it is not a good sequel. It is about Ian Malcolm from the first movie (Jeff Goldblum) who goes to another abandoned island where it is Site B for the Dinos. He goes to bring back his girlfriend who is there to study the dinosaurs. Along with him comes this one guy who's name I can't even remember and Vince Vaughn. His daughter also sneaks aboard the trip but lets not talk about that. They try to survive the wild creatures and thats about it. I mean other stuff happens too but again lets not explore that.The effects are nowhere as near as good as the first one, and the wonderment of dinosaurs being back on Earth is quickly glossed over. The characters are completely unlikable and they make extremely stupid decisions which really makes you question the realism of everything happening. Jeff Goldblum is super annoying in this. He is a great actor and his deliveries are amazing but to go a full 2 and a half hour movie with that is hard. David Koepp and Stephen Spielberg teamed up so nicely together in the first movie however in this one it seems like the writing is totally off sync with the direction style. It really didn't even seem that much like a Spielberg film. This movie isn't the worst thing ever but like I said it's definitely not good.

After being abandoned for decades, the island has been somehow thriving.

It's so frustrating to watch a thriller and see the characters constantly making poor decisions which lead to their downfall. For once I would love to watch a film and have the characters actually make wise choices so I'm not left yelling at the television. What ruined the second half for me were the far-fetched and exaggerated situations. I understand it's a movie but common, you could at least make certain parts realistic. It almost reminded me of a cartoon it was so fake. It was similar to a slasher film where the victim is sprinting away from a walking killer yet the killer constantly remains close behind (one of my biggest movie pet peeves). An example was when Julianne Moore was stuck in a building being pursued by a raptor. She managed to climb up at least 2 or 3 stories while on scaffolding even before the raptor had entered the building, all of a sudden she makes it to the top and the raptor is right behind here. WHAT!? I also found it frustrating that no one closed the door behind them when they entered a room. THERE'S RAPTORS BEHIND YOU! My final frustrating issue was at the very end when they managed to bring a T-Rex back to the mainland. Apparently a locked up dinosaur within the boat was able to kill everyone aboard? There were limbs scattered around the ship yet the dinosaur had yet to reach the surface. The movie showed a severed hand attached to the ships steering wheel which apparently was bitten off by a T-Rex within a little cabin yet the cabin remained perfectly in tacked. Am I the only one who sees the complete impossibility of this? The only reason I didn't award this movie a 4/10 is due to the great cast and the fact I love adventure/thriller/sci-fi films. Ughhh why did the worst Jurassic Park have to have Julianne Moore in it, wish she was in the first or third.",The Lost World - Jurassic Park

I wish Lost World should have a lot of carnivores dinosaurs killing the people, that would make me more happiest. I still recommend for those who are interest of a dinosaur movie, this one maybe last for awhile, it might be like Jurassic Park 1 but it will do.

As a sequel it works wonderfully, giving us details about what happened to the odyssey of the first film, not forgetting that dinosaurs are animals, not monsters.

420,trailerspeliculasub,a fun and more scary thriller than the first one going back to the classic Spielberg Jaws,8,25 November 2016,this is one of the movies i disagree with the comments about this film. this is a pretty good movies. Spielberg did a great job. some people compare it to Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull. and is not like that movie. obviously is worst than Jurassic Park but they all are. Jurassic Park is the best movie. is a classic. The Lost World had many unfair criticism. Spielberg do something different. more scary more dark. more like a horror monster movie. and people think just because he try something different the movie is bad. no! the problem with Jurassic World is that id didn't try something different it did the same thing. in this movie is different and so classic Spielberg going back to Jaws a thrill ride like this film great script and acting easy the best sequel of Jurassic Park,The Lost World - Jurassic Park

First is the inclusion of an annoying stereotypical smartass teenage child who thinks she is smarter than the adults around her. I despise this in movies. I despise children in movies. Oh and she is an African-American indicating she is the product of an interracial coupling! Oooooooo so shocking and trendy!!!! In reality it is quite boring and dated. This child serves no purpose and adds nothing to the plot except to get in the way. I kept wishing she would be the first to be killed and eaten. This whole POS is just like a slasher film from the 80's. A whole new group of ""actors"" are brought on screen to be killed...but not the useless ""lead"" actors. Moore's performance was just awful. She comes off as an arrogant insufferable know it all who is more knowledgeable and better than those around her. All at once she is a dino doctor, a professional pharmacist for an extinct species, a sharp shooter, a survivalist, an animal rights advocate and extremist, mother figure, feminist, and on and on. I wanted her to be eaten ASAP. Goldblum just plays the same snarky ass character he plays in every movie. The whole goodie two shoes personae of the ""good guys"" is enough to give anyone loose bowels and projectile vomiting. The whole man bringing evil to animals sequences was better done in Avatar. How Vince Vaughn ever made it as an actor is a mystery. He is just a pudgy waste. Oh and let's not forget the whole trailer off the cliff. Very predictable. This waste was made just for the money. Even SS realized what a mess this was. It would have been better if he had them killed off. But no, the ""leads"" are immune.

424,pkaplan-283-370802,Good action,6,4 February 2012,"""It always starts like this... ooh, ahhh. Then there's running... and screaming.""- Dr. Ian Malcolm While in ""Jurassic Park"" both the 'ooh, ahh' parts and the 'running... and screaming' parts were equally enthralling and captivating, it's mainly the running and screaming that's of interest here. Outside of the opening sequence much of the early section of the film just isn't very interesting.The strength of this franchise as a whole is its setting. The creepy, slightly spooky and weird islands with plenty of rain provide a perfect setting for some inventive dinosaur attacks and dramatic tension. This is why taking the dinosaurs off that island and into civilization was a mistake- it's too familiar. It loses the spookiness and distinctive feel of the 'Lost World' fiction sub-genre and ends up feeling cheap and silly. I'd say that from about thirty minutes in until the last thirty minutes this film is on par with the first installment in terms of pacing, characterization, and dialogue... then it deteriorates. The film never gets bad enough for it to be unwatchable but there are mediocre parts here in addition to the exciting parts.The characters are solid as well as the cast. Dr. Alan Grant is sorely missed, but Malcolm is fun enough to compensate. Dr. Sarah Harding played by Julianne Moore is a good supporting character as is Pete Postlethwaite's Captain Ahab-esquire Roland Tembo. The cinematography by Janusz Kaminski is solid here and although Spielberg doesn't seem to be very inspired here he is a professional and knows how to make a film work.If it wasn't for the dull opening half hour and the misguided final act this would have been a consistently entertaining, action-packed romp. Sadly, it wasn't to be. Still, ""The Lost World: Jurassic Park"" is far, far from the garbage some would have you believe it is and is actually a solid action/adventure film.",The Lost World - Jurassic Park
425,seppo-sihvo,Seriously uninspired.,4,1 March 2009,"The first Jurassic Park had an immense impact on not only the industry of special effects but also the world of paleontology. Dinosaurs had never been seen this way before. The sequel sadly fails to impress or even challenge the viewer to expect the unexpected from stories we have seen repeated in the sausage factory that Hollywood has always been in a sense a bit too many times.Jeff Goldblum's character once said in the first film: ""You didn't earn the knowledge for yourselves, so you don't take any responsibility for it. You stood on the shoulders of geniuses to accomplish something as fast as you could and before you even knew what you had you patented it and packaged it and slapped it on a plastic lunchbox, and now you want to sell it."" It seems this is exactly what happened to the director of that first movie. Many people actually don't know what has become a harsh fact: Steven Spielberg HATES movie sequels. No kidding. The Lost World: Jurassic Park is the only sequel to a Spielberg film in existence that has actually been made by the man himself aside the Indiana Jones franchise that he made with close friend George Lucas. What's this got to do with this review? Well, let me get this straight. If a respected film-maker whose movies have freshly challenged the minds of audiences around the world for over three decades makes a sequel he doesn't give a blasted pilcher about yet wants to make that can only mean one thing: We all got punk'd! The Lost World has it's basic idea and setting taken from a Michael Crichton novel of the same name the author wrote mainly with Spielberg in mind. The novel, in the way it's story comes to be, was much more efficient in conveying what happens in the said setting via approach we can believe could happen to us because it's confined and down-to-earth in it's way of building the tension. Only the basic idea of two teams(the other changed to a small army in the movie) and another island used for dinosaur creation were used in the film. That's it. And why just that and nothing more? Because they could. There's no point here, just excuses, excuses to rake cash on a story concept that in my humble opinion deserves better. This is something it never truly got. Not here, because Big Spiel's got a big issue with sequels. According to his words from the time, films like this are canary tricks meant for exploitation. I beg to differ. Sequels don't have to be plain products for reptile brain kids if they are made with the right things in mind. And whoever has those right things wasn't around the production of this one.In it's essence, The Lost World: Jurassic Park is nothing but a shameless, bloated rehash of the first JP without the same smart challenge that first film gave our minds. This ones a canned version, meant for easy consumption and throwaway, something made obviously clear by the cheaply scripted King Kong knockoff ending. A product with some art slapped on it for other words. You might enjoy it but rest assured, this is not intelligent Spielberg storytelling that we once knew and in fact only appeals to the true target audience, little children who watched too much Barney. A disappointment and wasted potential on a concept that showed promise in more than special effects.",The Lost World - Jurassic Park
426,callum-mccolgan,"Occasionally thrilling, but often dull sequel",4,16 January 2018,"The Lost World is by most measures a somewhat decent blockbuster that is still able to offer a few punchy thrills despite its age, but lacks the sense of awe and wonder that defined the original, leaving something that feels empty and hollow by comparison.The story in The Lost World is perhaps the single weakest point. The book its nominally based on of the same name carried a similar air of obligatory sequel that clearly sprouted from a desire to cash in on the success of the original rather than to expand meaningfully on it. Despite the workmanlike prose and comically over-the-top violence though, Crichton's sequel did at least offer some degree of substance with its long passages of scientific posturing. However incongruous and rambling it may have been, it gave the book enough meat to keep you reading.The film strips this out and instead replaces it with irritating stock characters and pointless action. There's not a single dinosaur attack in this movie that isn't brought on by the character's own stupidity. This might be fine, but the screenplay doesn't seem to be aware of this and instead seems to expect us to root for these idiots, despite the fact that their actions are responsible for most of the deaths in this movie. And though Goldblum and Postlethwaite bring charm and weight to their roles (the latter playing perhaps the only intriguing character in this film), they're not enough to save the film's convoluted and muddled storyline from descending into mediocrity.As for the action scenes themselves, they're of somewhat mixed quality. Most just feel contrived and forgettable, paling compared to the original. However, there are at least three particular scenes that stand out from the rest - the cracking window, the long grass and the harbour scene. These scenes are worthy of anything the first film could offer - tense, exciting, imaginative, awe-inspiring. I'd even go as far as to say that they're good enough to redeem the film and make it watchable, however much the story becomes mired in uneven messages.The effects here are another highlight, despite the 97 CGI starting to show its age. Tthe dinos here are every bit as lifelike and terrifying to behold as they were in the original. But then why does this film still feel so lacking in awe? Even discounting the sequel problem, the whole film is rudderless, never sure if it's trying to convey a deeper environmental message or just be a dumb action film. The result is less a seamless blend than a stitched-together mashup, falling flat as both.For me, The Lost World is the nadir of the Jurassic franchise. It has neither the awe of the original, the simple entertainment of the third, nor the big-budget-action of the fourth. It's not an outright bad movie, not quite - there are some truly fantastic moments, a handful of good performances, and the dinosaurs are as cool as one could hope for. Ultimately though, The Lost World would probably have been better off staying that way.",The Lost World - Jurassic Park
427,xy_cjm,Why couldn't they just let Jeff Goldblum get eaten in first movie.,5,1 April 2018,"The movie was quiet frankly disappointing out of the entire franchise. The acting was terrible. Jeff Goldblum was annoying in the first movie and just continued to bore in second movie. With the Independence Day: Resurgence being a mega flop; one would expect that Jeff Goldblum would not be casted in any of the Jurassic World sequels, but unfortunately it looks like he is going to be in Jurassic World 2. Just my opinion, but both films had and have potential; but they really need to focus on keeping the top talent around. Additionally keep us surprised at what may happen and introduce the latest technologies, and ones that are in progress; one of the captivating things about the original Jurassic Park, was the technology that was displayed...that was just barely starting to be used and tested in the real world.",The Lost World - Jurassic Park

434,oscar-stainton,A Reckless but Thrilling Successor,8,3 July 2013,"The first thing to know about 'The Lost World: Jurassic Park' is that it's not as good as 'Jurassic Park', which is a very high standard to reach. As a young boy, I had reservations about this movie, but it's actually started to slowly grow on me more over time. People may find this strange because of the huge amount of hate towards this film, but I find there's still merit to be found.Story:After a family on a yacht cruise discovers Isla Sorna, the factory floor island owned by InGen, and their daughter is attacked by a pack of compies, John Hammond is removed as CEO of InGen by his greedy nephew Peter Ludlow. Hammond summons Ian Malcolm, now scarred by experiences in Jurassic Park, and asks him to lead an expedition to document the dinosaurs (at a distance from the carnivores) to earn the government's protection. After discovering his girlfriend, Sarah Harding, is already there, Malcolm joins Nick Van Owen and Eddie Carr and sails to the island. Ludlow arrives with a taskforce led by Roland Tembo capture the dinosaurs and take them to San Diego to flaunt them in a zoo. At night, Nick sabotages the InGen camp and brings an injured baby T-Rex to their trailer to patch it's leg up after Roland had captured to bait the father Rex. The T-Rex parents soon retrieve the infant and push the trailer over a cliff, and Eddie is killed trying to save Malcolm and team before InGen arrives to help them out. Both stranded teams concede to join forces to get off the island. The film culminates in a fun (if divisive) 15-minute sequence when the male T-Rex rampages through San Diego searching for his infant, paying homage to 'King Kong' and 1925's 'The Lost World'.One key problem most people have with ""The Lost World"" is that it's not as filled with wonder as the original, and this film certainly could have benefited from more scenes with the herbivores and characters enjoying the island ambiance. Judging by some unrealistic moments and plot holes, such as the way the trailer fell or the scene where Malcolm's daughter is able to defeat a Raptor with gymnastics, and the fact that the crew of the ship holding the Rex was killed with no clue as to how it happened, Spielberg was not fully committed to this film, which is a real shame. The build-up is also fairly slow, but can be skipped. Personally, the infamous gymnastic scene just makes me chuckle, it's not worth getting angry over. And I admit that I relished in the Rex's travels in San Diego and his reunion with the once-again captured infant.Another major criticism is that main characters cause more death and destruction than the InGen team, and that is partially true. Sarah cannot seem to keep away from dangerous dinosaurs in the field and can be annoying at times, but she still helps lead the T-Rex away from civilians in San Diego. However, Nick is just awful; he's a self- righteous environmentalist whose actions include releasing the captive dinosaurs on the InGen team and stealing the bullets from Roland's rifle to prevent the T-Rex from being killed, thus putting more people in danger. Frankly, I regard him as a hidden antagonist responsible for the chaos, thankfully he's absent from the San Diego sequence. Ultimately, the lack of defined heroes and villains feels more in keeping with the grimness of Michael Crichton's Jurassic Park novel, which was very cynical, and potentially disconcerting to certain people. In this movie's defence, some characters do stand out in a positive light; Ian Malcolm is just as eccentric and witty as ever if more cynical (Jeff Goldblum an acquired taste, really). Another worthy character is Eddie Carr, who is killed by the T-Rexes in the act of saving Malcolm, Sarah and Nick. Hammond's brief appearances were a delight to watch, and the character Roland Tembo is a bold, tactical hunter with an air of dignity and passion that earned my respect as an anti-heroic figure.It isn't really a film about environmentalism so much a film about reaching compromise between two dangerous extremes, personified by Roland and Nick. Another theme is failure to treat what you create with responsibility, as seen with InGen's haughty regard for the dinosaurs as financial assets and not real animals, rather like Frankenstein's negligence towards his creation. Taking the dinosaurs to the mainland zoo would have been disastrous, as Crichton's underlying belief that humans and dinosaurs don't mix is still present.It's also worth remembering that this is a movie of dinosaurs in the wild so there will be higher danger than on the theme park island. I personally find it appealing that we can see the dinosaurs out in the wild simply being dinosaurs, especially the parental instincts of the T- Rexes. The dark, primordial atmosphere of Isla Sorna, accompanied by John Williams' excellent jungle-themed score, does instil a sense that you are in the midst of the dinosaurs' domain, with a few reprisals of the original themes. The CGI dinosaurs look better than most CG creatures today; their behaviour feels genuine, much like real animals, especially with the scenes involving a herd of Stegosaurus and the scenes with the T-Rexes. The animatronics are just as sharp and engaging as the first film, from a technical standpoint, it's well crafted.Ultimately, ""The Lost World"" is an enjoyable, if reckless, survival film that gives the incredible dinosaurs of InGen a visceral return. Spielberg's style holds it up as an advancement of the Jurassic Park universe. There are plenty of thrills, engrossing action scenes, and a dark and wild atmosphere that could have been helped by more moments of wonder. I certainly wouldn't call this Spielberg's worst movie. Despite being dwarfed by its grander predecessor, it's a fun movie, if flawed.",The Lost World - Jurassic Park

436,Dash_Rendar,Excellent Sequel,8,18 April 2006,"Creating a worthy follow-up to a major blockbuster is no easy task. But if all the pieces are in the right place, it is not impossible. Four years after the enormous success of Jurassic Park, Steven Spielberg took control of the director's chair once more in an effort to enhance the franchise and add on to his already spectacular legacy. Did he succeed? In the eyes of most critics, no. However, I applaud Mr. Spielberg for an admirable effort and creating another crowd-pleaser, even if it didn't match up to the high expectations.On another personal note, I was very happy to see Jeff Goldblum reprise his role as Dr. Ian Malcolm as he has always been my favorite character in the series. Since Malcolm is now more aware of the dangers of John Hammond's activities, his personality is less goofy and more serious this time around compared to his previous adventure.It took several viewings for me to appreciate this film to its fullest. At first, it seemed weak because it sacrificed the philosophical messages that helped make the first film great to fit in more action. The philosophy is found in one of the key quotes by John Hammond. ""Life will find a way."" There *is* a point to all the chaos because it is all caused by the humans and their relentless desire to interfere with nature. Every tragic event seen in the film could have been avoided with sensibility and that is the message that is echoed throughout the entire series. Don't attempt to control the uncontrollable.If there's one thing that makes the film worth watching, it has to be the special effects and the dinosaur animatronics. The infant T-Rex featured in this film is so lifelike that I often had to remind myself that it wasn't a real dinosaur. It was *that* convincing.Also be on the lookout for Vince Vaughn (before he became the mega-star that he is today) as one of Hammond's researchers and a humorous scene involving a T-Rex in the modern world.",The Lost World - Jurassic Park

The original Jurassic Park had scenes that were so classic, so breathtakingly suspenseful, that it would be almost impossible to top them. Also, the first movie did a wonderful job of mixing the bright and sunny scenes while contrasting it with the dark and rainy ones. I felt The Lost World was a lot darker and didn't take enough time to show off the beauty of the Island. One exceptional moment for me in this film was the window glass cracking scene when they were dangling over the cliff. That was unique and breathtaking suspense.

It's perfect (if I get to write a JP review sometime, I'll tell you why :) which is why I didn't watch TLW when it came to cinemas, cause I felt it would ruin the impression left behind by the first one. Besides, I'd heard that it was gorier and more sinister than the first one, which would underline my impression that bad movies always try to make up for their weaknesses by an excess of blood. However, after having seen JP3 first, I definitely have to say that TLW is not so bad after all. The story is a little weak (which is because the general ""man versus nature, things going out of control"" idea is covered by the first one) but at least there IS a story, as opposed to JP3. The dialogue can't measure up to JP's (I wouldn't bother watching this one until I know it by heart),but compared to JP3's, it suddenly seems like ingenious screenwriting. The dinosaurs are, as usual, great. And this movie has its own musical theme, which is more than can be said for JP3 (I have a sneaking suspicion they made that movie from clippings from JP and TLW's editing rooms). Unfortunately, a lot of what we see is nothing new (let's just say most scenes from JP find a corresponding one in TLW). Before I go on to the ""spoiler"" part, let's say that on a scale from 1 to 10, JP would get 9,75 (quarter point off for the abundance of minor flubs), JP3 would get 1, and TLW ranks between 4 and 6, depending on whether you see it prior to or after JP3. One thing has to be said: No sequel will ever, EVER be able to recreate the suspense that's there when you watch JP for the very first time, curious as to what the dinosaurs will look like, and THEN the t-rex approaches with ominous ""THUMP""s...
SPOILER WARNING
That the plot could not measure up to JP's is to be expected. But what bugs me is that most of the action scenes give us a déjà vu. The hunting scene reminds us of Grant, Lex and Tim running in the middle of the gallimimus herd. The trailer scene reminds us of the T-rex smashing the car and pushing it off a cliff (and if I remember correctly, Lex and Grant were dangling by a rope, too). Ripples in the water don't have quite the scare effect they used to have. (Continuity: T-rex's steps can be heard minutes before he's actually there, except in the last scene on the boat. Hmmm.) The compys are new and very well done but that scene is awfully brutal (no points off for this though, it's excellently done. But I wouldn't show it to a ten-year-old.) Using two rex instead of one is impressive, but it doesn't make up for the fact that we've seen most of this before. Harding's approaching the stegosaur reminds me of JP's brachiosaur. And what is it with American movies and cute animals, anyhow? A paleontologist approaching a dinosaur enough to pet it. Yeah, right. And what do I do when I find a T-rex baby suffering that will attract the parent any moment now (that's what they put it there for!) I, as someone else correctly said, put a bullet in its head- or at least leave it there. But I definitely don't risk my life to cure the broken leg of the Earth's greatest predator. At least it ate the stupid obligatory American dog.",The Lost World - Jurassic Park

445,wowarning,This movie is a good time - PERIOD!,10,25 September 2001,"How people can bash this movie is beyond me - can you find flaws in the plot line - yes.  Are there occasional inconsistencies - yes. Are they any worse in this movie than the ones in Star Wars and Indiana Jones - no.  Instead of nitpicking every little thing that Speilberg did wrong, why not take a step back and look at all he did right.  This movie has some excellent acting (Goldblum and Postlewaite),a very good story, certainly good enough to string together all the incredible action sequences and movie magic that we're engulfed by throughout the entire film, and it actually pulls off a little moral statement about our society (both the stupidity of some hunters wanting to kill anything they can, and the stupidity of some tree hugging peace-niks that think everything should be saved.)  The suspense is there too - I actually jumped out of my seat watching the movie again last night during the raptor/shack scene.  People were obviously expecting something else from this movie when they bash it, but what WERE they expecting?!?! This movie has all the coolness of the first film and delivers extra - 2 t-rexes, new dinos, great capture sequence, and the entire SanFran ending is fantastic (who as a child didn't have nightmares that looked EXACTLY like what happened to the little boy?).  If this movie had been the first Jurassic Park movie, people wouldn't have enough good things to say about it, and the first one would be a pretty weak follow up - wouldn't it?  To throw in a personal music opinion it is like the band Boston's first two album releases.  The first one became an instant classic and one of the most played albums possibly ever - because it was great and nothing had ever sounded like it before.  Their second album sounded just as good as the first, same strong songwriting and catchy riffs, only something already sounded like that before, so people were less taken by it.  Take my word for it - this movie is a good time, even though it's the SECOND dinosaur movie to be a good time.9 of 10, but it gets a 10 to make up for idiots that bombed it.",The Lost World - Jurassic Park
446,rosscav3,far from crichton's book and even further from spielberg's talent,6,2 March 2002,"RATING: 2 OF 10i agree that no movie, no matter how good, will ever be as good or as fufilling as the book (assuming of course there is a book for the movie) and I agree with spielberg's idea to take certain ""liberties"" with the making of his movie, but this movie strayed so far from the book that it shouldnt have even carried the same. The story is completely warped, many main characters are completely omitted and some (in fact MANY are added! for example the whole ingen crew of dino poachers! what the hell? not one man from ingen was in the book! there were three poachers steeling eggs and thats all, and they werent planning to take them to some new park in san diego either). one main character that was COMPLETELY omitted was a RICHARD LEVINE. he (in the book) was the whole reason that every one got dragged to the island (brief summary: NOTE: CONTAINS SPOILERS OF BOOK!!! Levine finds island and goes there w/ guide-> guide killed/levine stranded. malcolm, THORNE(older burly guy not in movie(sean connery would have been perfect!)), eddie, ARBY (black kid, also not in movie), and kelley (WHITE and of no relation to malcolm or on any gymnastics team). this team reaches island and find levine. sarah comes afterwards with poachers (doesnt know that they are poachers at the time and was her only way of getting there). poachers are dodgson (nedrys affiliate from the original JP) a scientist named baselton, and a friend of dodgson named king. on the way to the island (isla sorna, by the way) dodgson throws sarah overboard. i assume, he did this because she found out too much. sarah, as strong as she is makes the short swim through the rough seas about the dangerous cliffs, into a cave and onto the island) she later meets up with the rest of the crew, and dodgson's gang begin their egg snatching...) NOW i believe that spielberg could take some liberties here and add HIS touch to it after you establish this basic introduction. anywho, in the end of the book (WARNING: MORE SPOILERS OF THE BOOK!) malcolm (injured leg again), thorne, levine, arby (bably bruised from an encounter with the raptors) and kelly escape on a boat, while all of dodgson's crew were killed (which was a shame becasuse king was a good guy)...  If spielberg had followed this basic plot, he still would have been able to put in his ideas and make a great film, some of the images i got from the book were beautiful, frightening, and suspenseful and could have been translated beautifully to the big screen. I respect spielberg greatly and do not mean any disrespect to this great man, but what the hell was he thinking? I loved this book and strongly recomend it to anyone who hasnt read it. if i grow up to become a director, i vow to remake this movie how i envisioned it (if my budget will allow). oh yeah and in conclusion, i suppose, THE TREX NEVER WENT TO SAN DIEGO!!

449,gm-stratford,Something Has Survived,8,27 September 2004,"It only follows suit that the more you anticipate and look forward to something, the more likely you are to be disappointed. This is accurate throughout life, and movies are no exception, especially their sequels!It has been 4 years since the disaster at Hammonds Jurassic Park, and the board of Hammonds company Ingen have used the incident to take control of the company from him. Meanwhile, a girl is attacked on a Costa Rican Island and it is discovered that John Hammond had a secret 'SITE B' for Jurassic Park used to breed and nurture the animals. Hammond wants to preserve this island, this 'LOST WORLD' and keep it away from public gaze (""wow, you've turned from Capitalist to Naturalist in just 4 years, thats something"" -- Ian Malcolm to John Hammond) To do this, he must send in a group of specialists to photograph the animals alive and flourishing in their natural habitat. Shortly after that said team arrives on Isla Sorna (site B) a group of Ingen mercenaries arrive, and with a much different agenda!It was inevitable that the hype surrounding the sequel to one of the biggest grossing films of all time was massive, and as i have said, it can often lead to disappointment.There are 3 major elements to this film which prevent it from reaching the success of the original. Firstly, it has a rather weak story. A good premise i must admit but Malcolms heroics to save his girlfriend seem a rather lukewarm way of making him return to a Dinosaur filled island. The Michael Crichton novel is far better than this adaptation but unfortunately apart from a few scenes, the film fails to grasp the ideas of the book. Many feel that it would have been a wise choice to follow the book more accurately! Secondly, Jeff Goldblum's character Ian Malcolm takes a complete 180 degree reversal. He turns, from an eccentric, cocksure mathematician brainiac to a clichéd American anti hero with no substance, and it really does show. Love him or hate him, Malcolms character was very distinctive in JP, but in TLW, it becomes rather obscure. Thirdly and finally is the Ending! I wont spoil it for those few who have yet to see it but the San Diego attack at the end is the killer for me. In our own little sad way, us movie lovers could imagine that in our own little world, this Dinosaur cloning could be happening, but once a 20ft t'rex has a race with a local bus down a busy San Diego street, the illusion is somewhat spoiled! I can understand that they had to do something 'Big' in this sequel to surpass the original, but sometimes surpassing isn't easy, or indeed necessary. Sure it looked great on the teaser trailer when Rexy roared at the night time San Diego skyline, but in the final product, you feel somewhat cold to the whole scene. For me, the Dinosaurs in the JP films look better in their once natural habitat of the jungle. This is where they lived, and this is where they seem most ferocious, intriguing and above all, realistic.Now, on positive notes, the film has that typical Spielberg atmosphere. An atmosphere carried through from the original. There are a few excellent action sequences (most noticeably the Trailer sequence)that are up there with the best JP moments and the attention to detail, CG, and animatronics are simply astounding and really do their part to immerse you in the film. One feels that if this was the first film in the JP franchise, it would have received as many accolades as the original did!!?But, at the end of the day, it isn't the first, its a sequel. And like a hell of a lot of sequels it cant quite match the original. I personally feel that its severely underrated as most of the gripes are to do within the franchise itself and the adaptation from Novel to Screenplay rather than filming issues. Its still highly enjoyable, highly stylish and a bucket load of fun. Popcorn movies at its best!!",The Lost World - Jurassic Park
450,Pythonman,"Great action, great film. Veeerrrry underrated.",8,8 June 2005,"OK, I know that a lot of people have a grudge with movie, even more than the campy Jurassic Park III, which was inferior to the first two combined. I, for one, loved this movie almost as much as the first one. Why?Well, for one thing, if there was ever any bad acting, I could hardly notice it. I was too wrapped up in its suspense and story. The characters aren't as memorable as the guys we grew up with in the first Jurassic Park, but they're certainly not as wooden or as boring as the new cast of Jurassic Park III (besides the ever-loving Sam Neil).And like I said; even if there were any bad acting to be found in this movie, then the action would certainly more than make up for that. I mean, a herd a raptors killing bunches of men in foliage? An army of compys ganging up on one lowly man? That bastard T-Rex going on that classic rampage, eating victims alive, especially at the city of San Diego, in a deliciously satisfying way?

I can go through a whole list of things wrong with this movie, but I think I'll just make the shorter list of what is right with this movie.-Kevin Bacon is not in it. -Michael Bay did not direct it. -It didn't win any note-worthy awards.I love Jurassic Park as if it were my child. I'd have to say it is easily one of the most essential pieces in cinema. It's in a league of it's on. I like to call that league the league of tearing-up. And by tearing-up, I mean neatly serving you your own hind-quarters on fine china with all the trimmings. Let's go on to what is wrong with The Lost World.I understand the reasons for this movie not following the book. Because then it would be ultra-boring and leave 99.9% of the people watching it completely confused. Why is this? Well, because the book is just Malcolm going on and on about evolution and adaptation. Interesting read, boring movie. But this abomination of a film is just whole wrong. I think a movie based off the book would have been better than this. Not as entertaining or as fun (as this movie actually was at some points), but definitely better. This movie, no matter how many times I watch it, will always just seem like a bad dream in my mind. It just leaves a bad tasted. Like that time I chewed on a dead rabbit. Overall point: This movie leaves me feeling uncomfortable, even when sitting in a micro-fiber message chair. It's awkward and shaky like a palsy victim working in fast-food. It just leaves a bad feeling in the pit of my stomach, like I shouldn't be watching it. Which is why I relate it to getting a kaleidoscope though my eye-socket.",The Lost World - Jurassic Park

However, the people behind the scenes forking over the money for movies can do a lot of wrong.  If anyone had read the book this movie is loosely based off of(I'm being very kind), they would know that this movie hardly resembled what Michael Crichton wrote.  I also have to question how much input he had into this movie.  Let's face it, the first two thirds of this movie were okay, but when they took it to San Diego and turned it into a Godzilla movie, it ran itself directly into the ground.  If they had given it another name it would have been a fun movie.  Other that all that I would like to say the cast did a wonderful job.  Jeff Goldblum has always been one of my favorites and he is the true Ian Malcolm.  Michael Crichton must have used Jeff as his model when he wrote the character.

And, I thought that when it was finally over, they did the unthinkable. Spielberg did a terrible job in selecting the film's end. It totally ruined a perfectly good Dinosaur, special effects showcase. I won't say what the ending is, in case you've never seen it, but prepare yourselves for the worst.Even though I did not like the ending to the film, it still did have its moments, and if you like the first film, check this one out and see for yourself.

With that action comes the danger and mayhem that you would expect from a sequel to Jurassic Park.

461,the_one_only_original_me,"Not the Best Sequel, But Still Not a Bad Sequel",6,8 November 2010,"I often find it difficult to pinpoint exactly how this movie falls short of its predecessor, Jurassic Park. I've always gotten the feeling that the movie just wasn't as good as the first, but I could never be sure how much of that feeling came from nostalgia for the first film and how much from the movie's own fault. But after some careful re-watching I believe I've found the main culprits.For one, the timing and dinosaur reveals aren't as masterfully pulled off. In the first movie, director Steven Spielberg did an amazing job building up to the dinosaur money shots, I didn't feel like I was kept waiting too long or for too short a time. And said money shots were incredible, beautiful, and chilling. In The Lost World I wasn't as anxious to see the dinosaurs by the time they were shown, and even when the dinosaurs were revealed the shots weren't as visually appealing or exciting and the build up lacked the subtle touches of the first movie. To be fair, it's nearly impossible to recreate that first time charm to begin with.The next issue is that the set pieces aren't as suspenseful. There are some creepy and tense moments (one especially eerie one involving a tent) but overall it's more geared towards action than suspense. Sequels like Aliens have taken similar routes, but the results don't pay off as well in The Lost World. The raptor scene is a great example: in the first film the raptors were cunning and sinister, and their portion of the movie was like a demented game of hide and seek. In The Lost World the raptors are used in a great action romp type scene, but it comes at the cost the monsters lethality and mystique. When raptors caught up to the characters in the first film it seemed like curtains for the heroes, but here the humans are able to run circles around the beasts. And I guess I should mention the infamous final act of the movie where a t-rex goes on a rampage in San Diego. It's a fun scene, and personally I can't help but love every minute of it. But it feels like overkill, like something tacked on at the last moment rather than part of the flow of the movie. But I find it to be a nice change in scenery and it always makes me smile ear-to-ear.As for the cast, Jeff Goldblum is likable as always, although his returning character, Ian Malcolm isn't as entertaining or lively as he was in the first film. He's more reserved and more sour in temperament which I guess is what happens to you after too many near death experiences with dinosaurs. Malcolm's daughter, Kelly, unfortunately yet another irritating seemly unnecessary child costar. Vince Vaughn seems miscast and his character comes across as dis likable at times, and Julianne Moore occasionally drops the ball acting wise. Can't say too much about the rest of the cast good or bad except for Pete Postlethwaite's Roland Tembo who is earnest and transparent in the best meaning of the word: he just wants to kill something worth killing, that's all he wants period. It makes him a real standout in a crowd of characters motivated by fortune, glory, rescue, and activism.More on the up side, the story is darker both thematically and literally. Gone is the lush jungle, instead replaced by dark nightmarish forest. Gone is the band of cynical experts, replaced by an assortment of activist who are willing to go to extreme lengths to keep the dinosaurs on the island. And forget kindly old man-child John Hammond, in his place is his money lusting nephew backed up by an army of grizzled hunters. And this isn't a dinosaur break out, it's a land dominated by them. The dinosaurs run the place, and humans are the intruders. Aside from the fact that it isn't explained why the hunters go through the trouble of catching adult wild dinosaurs rather than just steal eggs or infants like the villains in the book the story is solid and seems like a natural progression for the franchise: Hammond's company wants to reclaim their prehistoric cash cows and start Jurassic Park anew.The CGI and animatronics are improved, the dinosaurs seem more lively and more finely detailed and even more humanized thanks to the tyrannosaurus family. It's interesting to see the first film's lead monster as a caring parent this time around, in addition to also being the lead monster. And it's simply a pleasure watching the prehistoric cast do their thing.I'm always a bit mystified by people who refer to this movie as one of the worst sequels ever made. I agree that it falls short of it's predecessor, but I think it's a gross exaggeration to place this movie in the ranks of Batman and Robin and AvP:R. The Lost World is a truly under-appreciated sequel.",The Lost World - Jurassic Park
462,BigPimpinTom88,So underrated it makes me sick...,8,7 February 2004,"Includes mild spoilersIn recent years, Hollywood has been producing sequel after sequel for no other purpose than making lots of money. Sequels are often, if not always, empty and hollow money-makers. Despite what has been said many times before, The Lost World: Jurassic Park is not one of these films. It solidly stands alongside the original and complements it very well.First of all, I would like to set aside all of this mindless yammering about this movie being a butchered adaptation of Michael Crichton's novel of the same name. If you call the movie and the book different, then you are not a true Jurassic Park fan. Sure, the characters and events are drastically different, but when you get right down to it, the true heart and spirit of the movie and book are identical. They are both scientifically profound,including moral issues about whether or not it is right to exploit dinosaurs for profit. They both revolve around two teams: one is a team of dinosaur advocates and the other is a team of evil hunters who plans to raid the island. All of the characters of the book are still there, but they often manifested as someone else. If you pay close attention and analyze the movie it should be quite obvious. My only minor complaint is the exclusion of Lewis Dodgson. I feel that he is an essential villain to the story.
Cinematically, this movie is brilliant. It is flawlessly directed, written, and acted. The locations are breathtaking. The score is beautifully composed and conducted. The CGI is as good as ever. Stan Winston's robotic creatures are painstakingly detailed and lifelike. What more can you as for?And I am going to go nuts if I hear one more complaint about the San Diego scene. Sure, it's over the top, but it is a logical course for the plot to take. It is ironic because Peter Ludlow wanted to do what John Hammond failed to to, but in turn he caused more of a disaster than his uncle ever did.Anyone who claims that Jurassic Park 3 is a better sequel is out of their mind. Take the time to appreciate this movie for what it is. The Lost World: Jurassic Park is pure cinematic excellence!",The Lost World - Jurassic Park

That the villains have English accents is par for the course. That corporate rapacity is ascribed to them and not the Americans is a risible refinement in an era in which even the US military is being outsourced to rapacious and unprincipled corporations.One comes to expect this from US film-makers.

Although it isn't as good as the first film this is way better than the third. The lost World takes place on a different island to the first, on this second island the dinosaurs get to roam around freely. John Hammond (Richard Attenborough)asks Ian Malcolm (Jeff Goldblum) to go to this island and document the creatures. Malcolm finds out that his girl friend Sarah (Julianne Moore) has already arrived on the island. When Malcolm arrives on the island he finds out that his daughter has stowed away in one of the trailers. Also there is another team to try and capture the dinosaurs, eventually the two teams have to work together to try and survive the island. Although this film Doesn't measure up two the first it is a good try. I give this film 6/10",The Lost World - Jurassic Park

In the book there a max of 11 people on the island, and five make it back, movie-like 50. They messed up characters left and right and pretty much looked only to the book for names. If yo want to make a movie about dinosaurs Spielberg, then don't kill the Jurassic Park name.OK, excluding the book, not bad, a little hard to believe, especially when the T-Rex makes it San Fransico. The new plot come up from Spielberg deals with bringing Dino's back to San fran to make a new Jurassic Park. Malcolm, dead in first book, alive in second book, and both movies (weird) leads the movement that everything is hopeless, and eventually is the cause of much death.

Save the planet people, Green peace, Gun control people and showing us how horrible we people are with guns. Corporate America is still the worst. The token Black African child passing as white baby of Golblum...or whatever.Waste of time, money and morality from Steven Spielberg, what a low life in my opinion. So darn overrated its painful to watch him anymore.Julianne Moore was wasted here, although she never really adds much to anything I've seen her in: oh well.Pete Postlethwaite in another fine performance but cast as a gun loving murderous thug....got to love him.Shouldn't even mention but 'Vanessa Lee Chester'. What on earth was her character suppose to be? Why was this position filled with such a child? They actually cut to her ugly mug/face several times...why?

468,hacoach,Charmless,6,8 May 2017,"If you want to see a bunch of humans eaten and mauled by Dinosaurs than this is the movie for you.Steven Spielberg and Dinosaurs so what could go wrong. A lot it seems. When we watch a movie like this, the first thing we demand from the film is people behaving logically. Movies like this go off the rails when people start to do dumb things in deadly serious situations. Hitchcock knew this, his characters are put into similarly intense situations and always act accordingly. They get frightened when the moment calls for it and they immediately try to save their own skin when things get really tough.The second thing we want from a movie like this is the good guys have a fighting chance and even the misguided guys have a fighting chance, This movie in delights in killing off people it deems deserve to die, and even a few who don't, as if to show the Dinosaurs like storms or natural disasters do not care who is good or who is bad. And the humans just have no chance to fight back, we wait for the moment when they do, but it doesn't happen because its not suppose to happen.The worst aspect of this film is that humans always seem to be stopped from fighting back against the Dinosaurs, it's OK for the Dinosaurs to kill the humans because -hey they shouldn't mess with them. But Spielberg seems to be adamant that there should be no pleasure taken in humans killing Dinosaurs no matter how many people they kill. So the movie basically turns into a rather unpleasant kill fest.As for Spielberg; The master seems a little off form here, i would say he is uninspired by the lousy script, but he does give the cinematic world two great scenes. One where our 3 heroes must escape a trailer that us being pushed off a cliff by the dinosaurs in the middle of a rain storm. One of the best things he has ever done. And the spectacle of T-Rex running wild through modern day San Diego.There is a weird cruelty that runs through this movie, which is strange for a Spielberg movie and strange just for any movie that hopes to be popular entertainment. Which is best observed by the death of one of the few likable and pragmatic characters in the movie: Eddie Carr. Who dies while he is heroically trying to rescue the three people in the trailer. His death casts a pall over the movie. This is the problem with this film, its lack of heart and the human touch. Watching people murdered by Dinosaurs isn't really as much fun as it sounds. humans fighting back against dinosaurs and winning would have been more interesting but somebody took the bullets out of the guns, and fun out of this movie.",The Lost World - Jurassic Park

It was the most faithful to the fantastic Michael Critchton books, plus it was well done. As a sequel, The Lost World does just fine. Of course, I'm used to seeing horrible sequels all the time. Jeff Goldblum does a good job reprising his role as Ian Malcolm, and the newcomers of Julianne Moore and Vince Vaughn do well too. The story is a little unbelievable, though. After recently being replaced by his nephew as CEO of InGen, John Hammond(Richard Attenburough) reveals to Ian Malcolm(Goldblum) a site B: A place where dinosaurs run free. He sends him and his girlfriend, Sarah Harding(Moore), technology expert Eddie Carr(Richard Schiff) and photographer Nick Van Owen(Vaughn) to document the dinosaurs, while the official InGen team, led by Roland Tembo(Pete Postlethwaite), tries to capture the T.

Not just because of my nostalgia but it's genuinely underrated. While the first movie is still better with its charm alone this movie gets terror and thrills across much better. While it still has its flaws like every movie like for example starting the trend in the JP (Jurassic Park) movies where a lot of them are idiots. Another flaw being how dumb this movie can be, for example imagine karate chopping a velociraptor in the film and surviving, while that doesn't happen something along the line of that happens. Even with some more problems I still love this movie and while I find the first one critically leagues better than the lost world I think this movie is more fun and I genuinely like this movie over the first movie and Jurassic World.",The Lost World - Jurassic Park

After reading the book, I now know that he didn't.  The screenplay was built around a framework consisting of a handful of small details from the book.  There's an island full of dinosaurs, two groups of people go there, they play around with customized vehicles, and then everything goes wrong and people get eaten.  A total of three characters from the book are in the movie and two of the interesting quotes were based on quotes that Crichton wrote.  The only major scene that came close to doing the book justice was the tyrannosaur attack scene. Everything else was pure Hollywood nonsense.  I can't believe there's even speculation about making another one.",The Lost World - Jurassic Park

473,Chamby_X,A good follow up,9,20 August 2001,"A couple months ago I would have trashed this movie. When it came out I had high hopes for it, as before seeing it I had read Crichton's excellent novel and could only imagine how great a big screen adaptation would be. Obviously, The Lost World is nothing like the novel it's 'based' on, and this angered me for a while. After seeing the recently released Jurassic Park 3, however, I finally am able to separate the JP movies and books into two very different spins on a similar story. Having accepted that, I can now look at the Lost World once more as it's own movie and look at how it fits into the series. I think it fits in very well.I won't bother detailing the story, everyone already knows it. Jeff Goldblum does a great job stepping back into his Ian Malcom character, the supporting characters especially Vince Vaughan are great too. The dinosaurs, which is what everyone wants to see, are similarily well done. There's nothing really new from the first movie save for some stegos and pachycepholasaurs (sp?) but that doesn't matter as they all look as good if not better then they did in the first one.Now, as for the San Diego ending, at first I hated it and thought it screwed up the movie, now I don't. The scene is quite interesting in it's Godzilla kind of way, and the idea of the whole world knowing about the dino islands is good as it allows for more sequel ideas, which I certainly want to see. 4 out of 5 from me, and JP3 does it even better.",The Lost World - Jurassic Park

The film seems to ramble on with no concrete story, and the ending is completely out of taste and pathetic. My only hope is that the Jurassic Park 3 is decent.",The Lost World - Jurassic Park
475,TheEggman,What was wrong with the story in the novel (among other things)???,3,8 December 2000,"I am a huge fan of Michael Crichton, Steven Spielberg, Jeff Goldblum and John Williams.  But this piece of rubbish they tried to pass off as a viable sequel just does NOT cut the mustard! First of all, the original plot in the novel was intriguing enough, albeit a tad dry for a screen adaptation, what with ALL the discussions of extinction, animal behavior and what not.  Even still, Crichton managed to write a captivating story with enough action to make the NOVEL a worthy sequel.  However, how could he have signed his name to this? The movie starts out alright, with the story staying relatively close to the book.  But the discrepancies start to show very early, having taken four of the book's characters and condensing them into two - Eddie Carr (which is an amalgam of the book's Eddie and one of the main characters, Doc Thorne) and Kelly (who is a mix of the two children in the book, neither of which are Malcolm's kids).Granted, some of the scenes from the novel do make a small but passing appearance in the movie - however, some scenes come from the original novel ""Jurassic Park"" (such as the opening scene with the girl being attacked by the compys and the scene during one of the T-Rex chases where they hide under a waterfall).  Were Spielberg, et al., really hurting for decent scenes?  Because some of this comes off as mere filler, rather than important plot development (like the first film).  At least they managed to get the trailer attack scene in. Jeff Goldblum isn't as effective in this movie as he was in the first - primarily because without his glasses, he has a rather neanderthal look to him.  He needs a shave!  (At least he got a grooming for those iMac commercials.) Now, I am one of John William's biggest fans, loving his film music back to Star Wars and Indiana Jones.  The score from Jurassic Park was phenomenal and I get chills just thinking about it.  So what made him settle for the rather uninspiring original music for this one?  The sparse references to themes from the first film were SO sparse that when they were put to use, it was almost too obvious. In my opinion, he probably would have done better to continue more with the themes presented from the original score. Even with the completely unbelievable storyline (a T-Rex in San Diego???  Come on!), uninspired acting, and unoriginal music (the new theme Williams introduces tries too much to be like the first!), I still look forward to Jurassic Park 3.... ....However, I hope that the producers listen to the critics on this one and try to make it as good as the first (or at least, better than this one).",The Lost World - Jurassic Park

Here are just a few things that The Lost World does just like Jurassic Park: 1. Remember in Jurassic Park when the T-Rex attacks the cars, forces Dr. Grant and Lex over the cliff, then pushes the car over that cliff, just narrowly missing them? Well, expect to see the same thing in The Lost World, only with a trailer, and this time, the characters go through the car narrowly missing them. 2. Remember In Jurassic Park when Lex mentions earlier in the film that shes a hacker, then when times are tough, Lex comes through by hacking into the ingen system and saves everyone from the raptors? Well, expect to see the same thing with the Kelly character when she mentions that shes a gymnast, then kicks a raptor through a wall and kills it, saving everyone. 3. Remember the Robert Muldoon character in Jurassic Park? Well, look at Roland in this movie.The list goes on. I do like TLW, and have fun watching it, it just seems that Spielberg was tired of making this half way through filming. Also, why are the raptors so stupid in this when there are labeled as highly intelligent, problem solving animals in the first film? Every time one of the main characters is being attacked the raptors, they either slip and fall on the ground, fall off a roof, or trip over their own feet!

Two teams with different plans unexpectedly meet on the island, and only their goals will determine if the dinosaurs will live or die. Jeff Goldblum, Julianne Moore, the late Pete Postlethwaite, and Vince Vaughn, among others, are featured in this movie. Once again, Spielberg's dinos do not disappoint; the movie is brutal, complete with two Tyrannosaurs and their baby, sneaky raptors, and pesky little Compsognathus (not featured in the original JURASSIC PARK) that can bite you to death like a pack of wolves. I think the tall Goldblum and the stunning Moore (love her hair) make a good on screen couple, and Postlethwaite gives a determined performance as a Tyrannosaur hunter. While more situated for comedies, Vaughn blends in well with the drama.All in all, after a four-year absence from the director's chair ('93 to '97), Spielberg comes back with a bang with THE LOST WORLD.

Eddie Carr is the only character worth anything in this film. In contrast to the utter stupidity of his colleagues and enemies, he stands out. When he dies, the movie dies with him(I kid you not). After his character dies, the film goes downhill. This is probably the fault of bad writing and direction regarding some unbelievable uninteresting characters who aren't worth a thing.

Then all is wet again, until a velociraptor sticks his nose under a broken wall and exhales to create another dust cloud.

On an Island, a building destroyed by a hurricane, can have all its power restored with the throw of a switch. Must be a power plant somewhere nearby.
I don't want to get to deep into abnormal human reaction, like running with a baby dinosaur in your arms while being chased by mama dino.

In reality, this featurette follows the usual glorified trailer format, and the sound bites don't tell us a whole lot, though they add some small bits of information.

Oh well.I also think I have to defend that infamous ""T-Rex loose in San Diego"" sequence that everyone has ripped apart.  I don't think that Spielberg meant that scene to be taken too seriously--anyone who has studied his films knows that he always pays homage to other classic films, and this was his ode to King Kong/Godzilla.Regardless of popular opinion, I still believe that this film is a lot of fun to watch and is a fine continuation of the original rather than being a customary ""remake"" sequel.

502,Maffu,"It's a sequel,",7,29 April 2003,"Repeat after me ... ""Sequels aren't original....""They're in it for the money... well, DUH!  But that doesn't mean the creative people aren't trying.  An earlier review gave very little credit to the work that was done on this movie.  I agree, the story line isn't as good as the original.  Very few sequels are.  But then again, the first movie wasn't exactly Academy Award material, either.  It's pure entertainment. The audience didn't come to see ""Driving Miss Daisy"" - they came to see realistic dinosaurs and action sequences.  Believable or not. I thought the first portion of the film did a fine job of explaining the premise behind a trip to this new island.  No, it wasn't very deep and certainly wasn't dramatic.  But the purpose was to explain why the trip is being made.  Quickly and without a lot of to-do.  And I personally like Jeff Goldblum.  If anything, I think Jeff went a bit light on the character.  In the original book, Ian Malcom is basically a brilliant mathematician who doesn't get along with others.  Jeff Goldblum didn't make him as arrogant or annoying as he could have, and even made him a bit more likeable in this sequel.  Not necessarily a mistake; since he's the central character, it makes sense that the audience like him.  I would have liked Sam Neill back, also; but not in place of Jeff.  And Julianne Moore was excellent in her role, also. Not impressed with the dinosaur bits?  Well, perhaps the acting, but certainly not the special effects.  The SFX and computer work on this film were just fantastic!  And that's really what the audience paid for. Finally, just a -minor- correction.  It was San Diego, not San Francisco.

It was the scene where Sarah and Roland discuss the blood on her jacket from the baby T-Rex. They're both supposed to be experts, she claims at one point in the film that she knows what she's doing, that she's been around numerous carnivores and blah blah, and he's supposed to be this ""great white hunter"". But neither of them mentions that maybe it would be a good idea to expose of the jacket!!!!!??? Even after Sarah has talked about the excellent olfactory senses of the T-Rex and that it might follow them!!! And then of course later the T-Rex comes sniffing after the jacket in their tent, that plot was just too stupid for me to ignore!

510,sjp15991,Good but not amazing Sequel,7,12 January 2012,"The film is very flawed in places especially by silly parts of the story, for example the San Diego scenes at the end and leaves many unanswered questions like: why is Ian Malcolm's daughter black? and how what happened on the transport ship to San Diego (trying to avoid spoilers) actually happened?. I also generally dislike the character of Ian Malcolm, having grown up as a bit of a dinosaur nerd and a nerd in general I was always a big fan of Dr. Alan Grant but find Ian Malcolm on occasion funny but mostly slightly irritating.It does however have some very good points one of these for me was Pete Postlethwaite's character named Roland Tembo. The character he plays is an obsessive hunter who refuses a fee for helping Ingen's mission on site B and only requests that he gets to hunt a male Tyrannosaurus Rex. Roland Tembo realises the foolishness of his boss who suggest placing their camp in the middle of an area frequently visited by carnivores and says ""I've been on too many safaris with rich dentists to listen to any more suicidal ideas, OK?"" which is possibly the best line in the film. The later Velociraptor scenes are also good but with some slightly silly parts especially for younger viewers who will be especially worried when Ian Malcolm is hiding in a car while a raptor slowly edges its way through the window. The scene where Malcolm's group have there camp attacked is also a particular highlight and by far the best scene of the film with the hanging over the cliff scenes incredibly tense.The film provides both intensity and often good quality light humour but it is nothing on the original. The lack of Dr Grant ( who it should be noted is not in the book that the film is based on), the chaotic plot and also the irritating character of Malcolm's daughter combine to make it an inferior sequel but not an above average film. It is especially superior to Jurassic Park III and doesn't take long to get into the action but its flaws mean it will always be recognised as inferior to the original Jurassic Park",The Lost World - Jurassic Park
511,fstormchaser,Best Possible Sequel,10,16 September 2009,"I don't understand the hate. This movie is just underrated. People say it's all plot holes. Have they watched the third one? My god, this movie had tense human conflicts, intense action scenes, the best character from the first is the MAIN character in this one, a gripping story, good acting (in which you can tell the actors give a sh*t) and most of all: the same atmosphere as the first. In 3, everything is rush rush rush rush rushed. My theory of how the hate for this one got started was that people don't have real opinions, and don't know what to say, so pretty much, if it wasn't the meaning of life or exactly how THEY wanted it to be, they say it sucked (and, plus, it's a sequel, so of course it gets bashed), and after one person b*tched and moaned about it, everyone else without opinions decided to go with everyone else and say it sucked since that what someone else said. And that's society for you, people. Also, maybe if this movie wasn't so over hyped, people wouldn't have such high expectations. Then again, I can't blame the people for being hyped. The trailer was superb. Regardless, if you can understand how to judge a movie, and you're ready for some freaking FUN and action, then watch this one.

512,givoled,"Epic, wondrous and thrilling: The Lost World remains the best sequel in the Jurassic Park series.",10,1 July 2015,"Steven Spielberg's sequel to his Syfy classic Jurassic Park not only follows the same formula that fuels the fire of the original movie but has a rhythm of it's own to be it's own film. It's a darker, sleeker film this time around with a mean streak that delivers the goods ten fold yet never forgets it's roots as an intelligent thriller with a lot of heart. Jeff Goldblum once again provides the intelligent and dramatic backbone that drives the story forward while Richard Attenborough provides once again the majestic presence that makes this movie meaningful. Throw in a wonderful and strong turn by Julianne Moore and a strong scene stealing turn by the late great Pete Postlethweite and you have a stronger cast of characters than you had with the original.Spielberg brings some of his best bag of tricks to this film as well with some of the most show stopping scenes in the series including a falling Trailer scene that has to be seen to believe and to this day, the most scary raptor attack ever put on film. While there are a few viewers who did not like the climax in San Diego, that climax still packs a fun, mean wallop that neither the two sequels that followed (The horrid Jurassic Park 3 and the so so Jurassic World) have top in their entire films.While Spielberg and his main cast of characters did not return for the next two films in the series, nothing can take away from the sheer fun and excitement that The Lost World gives to the series.

And yet what is the end result?

How anyone actually green-lit this script is beyond me. The stupidity of the characters just goes on and on here. None of the main players thinks to bring a real gun. The Julianne Moore character makes a speech about ""don't interfere with the animals"", but only before marching up to a family of stegosaurs to pet the baby, then later, actually bringing the injured baby Rex into their trailer. I could go on, but there are far too many ridiculous, stupid things to list. I'm giving this 4 stars only for the skill of the effects guys (the dinosaurs themselves look great), and for some nice scenery which was well photographed.

514,sithocan,"It's not a blockbuster sequel, it's a B-movie.",4,7 August 2011,"First thing first, if you want to avoid sparing your time by reading below, the point is: don't watch it. If you still want some opinion, then go on and learn why. I haven't watched this movie in theaters, thank god I haven't. It seems it just borrowed the title from the original. The scientific assumptions on which the first movie was based are omitted here. In the original we learned that T-Rex have a poor sense of sight, it only recognizes motion. In this movie, let alone seeing motionless things, T-Rex have a capacity to investigate through a caravan's window. Apart from that, in the movie female protagonist claims that carnivores look after their child which is against scientific common view. Whereas bad guys see the baby Rex in his nest and says his parents shouldn't be far as it is a common knowledge. Also, female scientist always warns other for not interfere with life yet she bring the injured baby Rex to trailer to cure. As far as I know, even today, wildlife researchers and societies do not interfere with wildlife in any condition. Because in nature an injured animal dies, and any rescue attempt is regarded as interference with nature's law. In another scene, after Rex family gets their baby, they suddenly return and push the vehicle into the cliff. But they just push half of it then suddenly disappear. Any logic? No. And while another scientist tries to rescue them, Rex family appears again. Why did they return after taking their baby? Accordinbg to producers, to take revenge. Then why did they leave before completing their revenge? Did they forgot the oven fire open? And once gone, why did they return once more? To check? Then the trailer falls, scientists hanging on a rope through trailer slides uninjured with a one millionth chance, then T-Rex disappears again. And just 30 seconds after that the area is filled with hundreds. Nor Rex, nor them have seen each other. And how can a dozen small dino kill a person. They bite, yes, it hurts, yes, but as far as we see their jaws are nowhere near a piranhas. It takes minute to tear victim's skin, yet they can kill a man. Also, there are far bigger herbivore dinos than T-Rex. But how on earth their step can't shake the earth while a T-Rex's can? One last thing, by the time one and a half hour of movie passed we've seen the velociraptors only for 2 minutes. There is half an hour more but I can't continue. So if you still want to watch, enjoy your torture. Last word: It's not a blockbuster sequel, it's a B-movie.",The Lost World - Jurassic Park
515,weilbody,Why everyone bashes this movie,8,1 December 2004,"Living up to the hype of the first Jurassic Park is virtually impossible. It was at the time the pinnacle of special effects blended with great storytelling. The Lost World is a different movie than Jurassic Park and in ways it is funnier, wittier and probably a more entertaining movie.The plot of the Lost World is more complex, with more characters, more locations and more action. People who bash this movie I'd be willing to bet have only seen it once. The first time I saw TWL I wasn't to impressed. Then I watched it several years later and found out that my initial judgment was wrong. This movie is pretty freakin cool on any level. It blends wit with personality from its characters. And speaking of characters, my favorite is in this movie. No its not Ian Malcolm but the bad #$& T-rex hunter Roland Tembo (please god let him be in jp4! Won't happen though:)). This movie intellectually is fast paced. Fast dialogue, fast transitions, fast information and fast action. What we could do as movie lovers is lighten up. This is not one of the worst sequels of all time (see Gremlins 2, Rocky 5, Lethal Weapon 4, scanners 2, Jaws 2-4, Rambo 3, 2 fast 2 furious, Next Friday, Evil Dead 2...just kidding that movie rocks) Anyway, let's just chill out and appreciate this movie what it was meant for...entertainment.

516,nathan-hamilton-266-567203,The perfect ad-on to a great series.,8,15 January 2012,"The Lost World: Jurassic Park, is the sequel to the 1993 movie Jurassic Park which lives up to all expectations that anyone would have for this type of series. This leg of the trilogy touches more the adventure part than the science, and really demonstrates an ""In your face"" type adventure movie. The effects for the dinosaurs in this one are just as gorgeous as the first movie, but seem a heck of a lot scarier. You've got the classic T- Rex's, which really give a significant edge to this film. The T-Rex's appearances in this one are a lot more stressful than the first, as they seem like a gigantic apocalyptic threat to the humans that are invading the island. One of my favourite T-Rex scenes was the one with the trailer falling over the cliff. Steven Spielberg really went to the next level with his dinosaurs creating something magical and unforgettable. They brought in newer dinosaurs that were less present in the first, but they also depraved others from screen time. The terrifying Dilophosaurus was not present, and even the Velociraptors which had great emphasis in the first were less present in the second film. But even without their presence throughout the movie, they had a few scenes in which they proved to be absolutely incredible. The field scene was a great asset as well as the abandoned control station. Despite some of these dinosaurs being absent, the movie still establishes a balance between adventure, fright, and dialogue. The acting in this film was a bit of a shuffle from the first, the original characters like Sam Neill and Laura Dern were not present here. Therefore Jeff Goldblum took up the position of main character. Along with him, other known actors were added to the roster such as Vince Vaughn and Pete Postlethwaite. With all these significant actors, Spielberg was able to pull off a real adventurous rat race. Other than the dialogue being mediocre, the acting was spot on. Apart from the acting, effects, and overall story being nice there's still a few things that are not 100% clear in this movie. For instance, near the end of the movie a boat crashes at the San Diego dock and inside contains a male T-Rex which evades from the boat and roams free in the city. Moments later, members of the cast go inside the boat to check out what happened to the crew, only to find their body parts all over the boat. It is very unclear as to how exactly this whole scene happened. It would've been nice to add one extra conversation, or scene determining how exactly this whole event occurred. Besides that, the downtown San Diego sequence was an incredible add on to the terror and stress that the dinosaurs had to offer. Although we've seen this before in a different movie, ""King Kong"", this has something totally different and I don't think it should be seen as a rip off. Other than that the movie is, from start to finish, a trip back to the 1993 memories of the first Jurassic Park. After 4 years, this is an excellent refresher of one of the greatest adventure trilogies ever made. 8/10 is my rating,not up to par with the first and I still had a few problems with the story line here and there, but definitely worth your buck, and two hours of your day. Now go and enjoy this underrated masterpiece.",The Lost World - Jurassic Park

RIYL : - B-movies with simple, mindless action Michael Bay moviesYou have to know that sequels to blockbusters rarely live up to the original. That being said, The Lost World : Jurassic Park (1997), the second movie in the Jurassic Park series is a complete step back for the franchise.I did enjoy the first movie, Jurassic Park (1993) - rated a 7 /10.Disappointing movie which should be avoided by most movie lovers.PLOT: Like watching a teen slasher movie, you sit and wonder why the characters are so god-damn stupid in this movie. Too many plot holes to count, utter garbage.DIALOG: Seemed very unnatural for the situations encountered. The dry, dead pan delivery of Goldblum quips is terrible.I was bothered by the total unrealistic way the characters behaved, and impossibility of character actions. (Sure, Julianne Moore's character can run carrying a 150 pound baby dinosaur in her arms like a bread loaf)The suspension of disbelief is broken by sloppy directing and poor writing. WORST SCENE: < 80 lb. pre-teen girl gymnast swing kicks a Raptor through a second story window to be impaled below.BEST SCENE: Jeff Goldblum, running from a raptor, opens a door and runs into a small building, raptor jumps through a window into the building, Goldblum hastily opens door again and exits the building. Goldblum was PERFECT in this scene. His expressions were fantastic, it was very funny.One of the protagonists (played by Vince Vaughn) is a conservationist/ eco-terrorist whose deliberate actions causes the deaths of most of the characters in the movie. It bothered me that he was NOT portrayed as a villain or at the least a misguided fool. He is not held accountable for his actions.I wish overt political messages could be kept out of more movies.If you are a PETA lover then maybe you think it is just that a hunter who shocks a small dinosaur to get the animal to leave deserves to be painfully killed by a large pack of the same dinosaurs later. It bothers me that the movie masses are supposed to feel his death is vindication. The movie can provide simple escapist action to young viewers and others who do not like to think while watching movies.ACTORS:I thought the acting fine.Jeff Goldblum continues to seem out of place and unnatural in an action role. (Independence Day (1996) is another huge stinker that he helped bury.) He should stick to Wes Anderson type films.",The Lost World - Jurassic Park
520,chriscquinn,"Dull and boring, quite possibly Spielberg's worst movie",4,19 July 2015,"The Lost World: Jurassic Park is a painfully dull and boring movie, which is surprising since it is directed by Steven Spielberg, who consistently continues to make great films. But this is not one of them. The story is very stupid and you can easily tell this film was a cash grab and a sad excuse for a sequel. After the enormous success of Jurassic Park, both the book and movie, Michael Crichton was asked to write a sequel novel to Jurassic Park. He agreed to do so and had to write the sequel based around who they could get back for the second movie. They were able to get Jeff Goldblum back, so Ian Malcolm was made the main character. His character died in the first book so he had to make up a reason for him to be back for the second one. In the movie, like I said Jeff Goldblum (Ian Malcolm) is the main character, which would be a cool thing to see if he gave the same type of performance like he gave in Jurassic Park. But in this he phones it in, which sucks because when Jeff Goldblum is good in a movie, it adds a kind of vibrancy to the film, ex. Jurassic Park, The Grand Budapest Hotel. Even although he doesn't really try in this movie, he is still there nonetheless. Of all the performances in the movie I think Vince Vaughn was the best, who seemed excited to be in a big blockbuster after only doing smaller films before like Swingers. The CGI in this looks very good if not better than the first Jurassic Park, and the dinosaurs look very convincing. The film is well made on a technical level but a lot of the shots are bland and nothing extraordinary like in a regular Spielberg movie. His direction is flat and it kinda feels like one of his movies but at the same time it doesn't. I was very bored during this movie, it was nowhere near as fun as Jurassic Park. The theme in this movie is used rarely and they use it just to remind you that you're watching the sequel to Jurassic Park. An example of this was when Ian Malcolm is leaving Hammond's house they use the main theme while Dr. Hammond is walking back to his bed. I was expecting it to cut to some dinosaurs but nope, it's just him walking. So majestic. I'm just getting goosebumps thinking about it, screw that shot in the first one with the stegosaurus eating the tree. This blows that shot out of the park.

How touching. And how utterly idiotic. And then the TRex comes and they just give him the baby back. You'd almost expect him to say ""thanks"" and maybe offer them a pumpkin pie.I think the script really sucked because the only ideas they could come up with in order to put the characters in a dangerous situation, was for the characters to do stupid things.

The cast, especially Jeff Goldblum as Ian Malcolm, is great, the score by John Williams is amazing, the action sequences are suspenseful and thrilling, the story is engaging and the themes that were in the first film are still present (man messing with nature), some of the humor is genuinely funny, the cinematography is brilliant, and the effects are amazing and still hold up to this day after all these years.My only gripes with the movie are that some of the scenes here and there don't make sense and some cuts here and there are quite odd, particularly when it reaches the third act. While the third act is good and exciting, getting to the third act is quite jarring as when you get to that part, it feels jarring and out of place. If there was some scenes that build up to the third act, I feel like the transition would have been smoother.Despite the flaws, I find this movie incredibly entertaining and I don't entirely get why a lot of people don't like this film. This film to me has too many great things in it to say it's bad or uninteresting, at least in my opinion.

4. Her character thinks she's so smart that she doesn't have to listen to common sense or heed warnings of danger that are obvious because you guessed it, she's a genius. We also know that characters like this end up being frustrating to watch in movies because they end up getting other characters killed.What does she do?1. Gets caught in a herd frenzy after scaring a young Triceratops that starts the movie.
2. Saves a baby T-Rex that has a broken leg, not realizing that the familial instinct that she so argued existed would put her and the people tasked to save her in jeopardy when the T-Rex parents caught the scent of their brood and showed up and promptly destroyed the research bus. Yes, killing one of them.
3. Her character then proceeds to wear a shirt with the baby T-Rex's blood on it as a trophy while arguing that the T-Rex's sense of smell is unparalleled. So who is surprised when the T-Rex shows up smelling the blood stained shirt (hanging from the tent ceiling) and proceeding to attack the tent and killing multiple people when the T-Rex's presence is made known. Well honestly, she is as surprised as anyone.That truly was enough for me. Only in movies is arrogance combined with utter stupidity somehow written to not only survive but also ends up being one of the heroes in the end. Julianne Moore is a good actress. I have enjoyed her in several movies. Perhaps that was the goal and if that's the case, I say bravo but I doubt it was the goal. I was rooting for her character's demise from the beginning of the movie. You want a good movie, give the audience what they want and penalize stupidity and arrogance. In an environment where man is perceived to have to be perfect to survive, better and smarter than it's predator, it makes no sense how a character so obtuse should be standing in the end. This was one of the reasons the first Jurassic Park was so good. The smart characters were smart. Sam Neil's character knew what to do when thrust into a difficult situation. The dumb characters also got theirs in that movie. That's why you rooted for the heroes in that movie. In this movie, one hero (Pete Postlethwaite) isn't around in the end. His character has had enough of the shenanigans. The other, Goldblum, is simply the hero because he has to overcome all the other idiots in this movie.",The Lost World - Jurassic Park

Kind of saved the series as far as I was concerned. I even forgot how terrible JP2 was. Over the years I just remembered that JP1 was great, JP2 stunk and JP 3 was pretty good. Recently I stupidly watched JP 2 again and rediscovered why I hated it the first time. Julienne Moore and Vince Vaughn's characters were complete morons and everyone except the young girl deserved to get eaten. I so much hoped that Julienne and Vince would get chewed up when they were on the island. Even big Jeff's character was a bit of a tosser at times and he should have known better. The super smart hunter guy never even gave the blood on the rucksack a moments thought. Deary me...... The effects and storyline were actually good, but please would it not have been better to make the movie without morons.

529,samsamsontim,"Almost as good as the original, almost.",9,20 July 2015,Pulse pounding and very scary follow up to the original Jurassic Park has everything a real sequel to it should have. A continuation of the story that makes sense and real character progression not to mention much better special effects and more scarier scenes of pure carnage. Jeff Goldblum once again shines as wise cranking and adventurous Ian Malcolm and Julianne Moore is almost as good as his partner in crime. Thrown in a gracious cameo from Sr Richard Attenborough and a scene stealing Pete Posselweight as a dinosaur hunter and The Lost World becomes almost as memorable as the original Jurassic Park. Almost because the luster of seeing dinosaurs on the big screen has already been done with the original movie but the showmanship Spielberg gives to this sequel more than makes up for it.Probably the only good sequel in the series.,The Lost World - Jurassic Park

Something that i love about this movie it's that it wanted to change, and make something different from the original, but it doesn't have the relatable characters, the magic, the memorable scenes and other things. The San Diego scene is pretty good but it feels out of the movie and more like a monster movie. I really like Ian Malcolm here, but Sarah and Nick are flat and stupid, horrible characters. Roland Tembo is the only good characters over the lot of new characters (seriously there's a lot of new characters, which don't even develop over the movie) But i still enjoy it, but it doesn't have the rewatch ability of the original, i can see see the original one time on a week but i need a month to enjoy this one.",The Lost World - Jurassic Park

535,siempre-2,They managed to ruin a good book,6,14 February 1999,"The film really disappointed me. The first ""Jurassic Park"" was a film with amazing effects where the story didn't get in the way. After seeing ""Jurassic Park"" I read the books, and I think ""Lost World"" was a fairly good book. It also had an interesting message: The ecosystem heavily depends on the behaviour of the animals. The more intelligent life gets (and the raptors are portrayed as rather intelligent) the more their behaviour depends on education - passed from parents to their children. The first generation of animals on that island were or course raised without parents, thus missing their education. Their behaviour was not ""natural"", making a functional ecology on that island impossible. The project was doomed from the beginning.The movie completely dismissed this point of view, rather giving the opposite message: Those dinosaurs will form a functioning ecology if we let them in peace. They left out any intellectual interesting concept of the book, instead relying only on cliches (big companies are evil, evil men are dumb etc.) and on the special effects. Which, by the way, didn't seem to have been improved since the first part.Summary: A mediocre film saved only a little by the fascination we have for dinosaurs.",The Lost World - Jurassic Park

When I heard about a sequel, I was thrilled. And when I heard that the main character was Ian Malcolm, I was equally thrilled! I read the book, and loved it. Then I saw the movie... I wasn't thrilled anymore. The book is filled with a wonderful story, and wonderfully fleshed out characters. The movie... wasn't. Despite the wonderful visual affects the entire movie, the story, the characters, seemed really two dimensional. I would have walked out if it wasn't for Jeff Goldblum. He seemed the only redeeming quality of this movie. He brings Ian Malcolm back as lively and as exciting as in the original. But despite that, this movie still isn't worth it.",The Lost World - Jurassic Park
537,alfd,"Not AS good as the original, but OK",10,10 October 2000,"As a person who has seen and read both Jurassic Park works, I admit the film version is completly different than the novel. However, reasons for that are, if they were to be verbatim and have the exact same story line, the movie would be over 6 hours long, and pretty dull as much is not dialogue, but action. Some stuff in the books could not even be feasible in the movies. Read any novel that has become a film, and you can see it. In addition, I thought Lost World was pretty good. Not as good as the first, but pretty good. Kelly wasn't the best, but she did ok for a younger actress. The story line could have been added to, but it was pretty good.To those who thought the ""Godzilla"" scenes were stupid, I thought it was one of the funniest things I had seen. It is just after they get off the island where many died for nothing, and they added COMIC RELIEF to the film. Yes, it was a little random, but the reason they brought the Rex to the city was to start the JP: San Diego, not so it would run a muck and kill people. It was the screenwriters idea of what could happen if a t-rex would happen to stumble into downtown San Diego today. A bit like the newer Godzilla where it goes into New York. Godzilla, a bit, but still creative in how they accomplished it. Also, the whole Compy's killing the hunter: very good with the foreshadowing. I mean as soon as Sarah and the rest go back to camp you hear her say, in the background, something about changing the course of things, one of these things is: blood in a river. They killed him because he was the one who shocked the little compy first which probably made them HATE HIM, and after he gets killed, you see that pool of blood start to form, I didn't catch that until I watched it this afternoon (the palentologist makes reference to them not having a reason to fear humans). Also look what they did to the little girl. The point of this is, no one really knows what these EXTINCT animals would do in this situation because we cannot judge through the evidence we have how they MIGHT react in 1997 San Diego. These are just my thoughts, they may not be true, but hey, it is what I think. I thought it was a really good movie, it was meant to be funnier than the first and I think it was accomplished 100%. Not as good as the first, but completely different sequels usually are. I am in anticipation for Jurassic Park 3!!!!",The Lost World - Jurassic Park
538,shadowboxer70,Chricton kills his own works,3,15 June 2004,"Yet another example of Chricton ruining his book for the sake of money. Now most people who go see Lost World don't even realize there was a book behind it. And furthermore that that book is NOTHING like the movie. I realize Jurassic Park took a few, well many, liberties with the screenplay. But it still kept the thrill there and probably some cost down. The characters were mostly preserved and the audience still felt the excitement and fear behind these dinosaurs running wild.And then there was Lost World. Nothing like book, in fact Jurassic Park III realized this and went back to the book to make up for it. You need more than fancy special effects to make a good movie. And while most people can be afraid at the idea that somewhere out there dinosaurs own some little island, the idea of that dinosaur roaming the streets of San Francisco is only good for a laugh. Whatever plausibility the film had was ruined the moment that boat landed on the coast. Chricton, you do your own screen plays? For the love of god, bring some of your books out in them! You got lucky with Jurassic Park but remember Eaters of the Dead aka 13th Warrior? No, how about Sphere? Congo? Great books, terrible movies.",The Lost World - Jurassic Park
539,marcusrawks,"Beautiful CG, good suspense, yet full of errors.",6,22 April 2006,"This movie influenced many many people, yet.. everything they say, while trying to sound extremely intelligent, is a loud slap in the face of every researcher, explorer, and archaeologist that devoted his/her life to studying these extinct creatures. pretty much every dinosaur in this movie is incorrectly portrayed.Take, for instance, the Tyrannosaur in the film. a modern human could easily escape from this huge creature, seeing as this dinosaur has a relatively short stride, almost akin to our own. Even Tyrannosaurids were at least partially feathered at one point in time. Sure, it looks awesome, but still... *slap in the face to.... yeah* Now take Velociraptor. The actual velociraptor was small. The raptors in the movie didn't even have realistic proportions. people can whine about how it was ""actually based off of utahraptor"" and whatnot, but even after that argument, the creatures shared the same things that velociraptor did, being of the same Dromaeosaurid kinship.I could keep going, but yeah... haha. I'm sure you guys don't wanna hear me moan about this crap anymore. Just don't write a paper in school using this movie as reference. You will be laughed at.Now as i said, its full of beautiful graphics, wonderful suspense, and has a nice pre-historic atmosphere. They do a great job of making these creatures look alive. It is recommended for young adults that love dinosaurs. Older people might not like it that much, aside from the purdy CG, due to the corny acting, But as i stated, it is great for kids. (unless they are wieners and get scared by the huge T-rex Roaring.. haha.. I'm a dick.) Rent it, but don't buy, unless you are a fan of the Director.Graphics-wise, i rate the movie as a 9.

It's a great sequel to Jurassic Park and it's more exciting. There's more dinosaurs, more action, more excitement, more good actors. I don't get it! The Lost World shows Dr. Malcomn finding out about Site B of Jurassic Park and him going with a team there to study how dinosaurs lived without fences, barriers, human interference and lysine. Of course, we have Roland Trembo, a guy who's just leading Ingen's new operation to bring the dinos to San Diego zoo and Peter Ludlow, Ingen's new boss. Of course, we see the oohs and aahs and then the screaming and running. The raptor scenes were really intensifying. I mean, this is a MUCH GREATER movie than the first, although the first Jurassic Park did have its own charm. The music in the movie is really upbeat, the dinos look much better, the actors are really good (I really liked the cast of Roland) and everything is lively. I give it a full blast.

However, this movie was just awful for so many reasons. I surely didn't expect such crap from Spielberg. It's all the annoying little things that they make us put up with just so they shoot some pre-planned action shots or hopefully make it into a ride at Universal.1. How would Malcolm's daughter sneak into the camper in the first place, wouldn't he say goodbye to her before departing.2. What the hell was she doing at the construction site in the first place.3. Could they have picked a more confusing person to be his daughter, how about a pair of Siamese twins that were attached by the head.4. Could anyone possibly believe that Malcolm just happens to be dating or in love with the one person in the world that needs to go on the island first(Julianne Moore).5. An expert in the field (Julianne Moore) would be dumb enough to bring a baby T-Rex into the camper.6. Malcolm's daughter just happens to want to go somewhere really high & that 1 piece of equipment is available.Most of the characters especially Julianne Moore as just horribly miscast and seem really out of character. .....this is as far as I have gotten & I just can't stomach any more of this.

I remember watching this movie at the theater as a kid and enjoying the heck out of it. As a kid I just really found this film to be mesmerizing, exciting and entertaining. Watching it now I still found it to be a enthralling and fun movie to watch. The plot is coherent and the sense of action and excitement with the story is put together very well. There is a lot of good ideas and settings when it comes to the dinosaurs and human interactions and action sequences. It all melds together in the good old fashion Spielberg style. To the point it was thrilling from beginning to end. Most of the characters was coherent with the story and it was nice to see Dr. Ian Malcolm (Jeff Goldblum) as the main lead this time around, since he was a likable character in the first ""Jurassic Park"" movie.

549,jpm52-1,Crichton and Spielburg once again make a great team,8,11 March 2007,"While admittedly not as good as the first movie, this one has the right to be considered a cinematic gem. Unlike sequels to many other movies out there, The Lost World finds a healthy balance between creating an original and inventive storyline, and preserving the same whimsical sci-fi/adventurous atmosphere as it's predecessor.Positives: -Slightly better special effects than the first. -Spielburg still manages to work his magic with a plot that is merely a rough interpretation of the book (from what I understand anyways, I haven't actually read the book). -The scene with the trailer hanging off the cliff, while cheesy and somewhat unrealistic at points (but hey, it's a sci-fi movie, what do you expect) still remains as one of the most suspenseful scenes I've seen in a long time. -Ian Malcolm (Jeff Goldblum) was a terrific choice as a returning main character. -I personally liked the fact that more is explained about the science behind Jurassic Park, such as the ability for the dinosaurs to survive without the safeguards that they were ""engineered"" with (i.e. ""Life will find a way"") -the parental instincts of the T-Rex served as a basis for the dinosaur attacks. Instead of the creatures destroying the vehicles out of rage, they destroy them to protect their child. In this aspect, the dinosaurs are portrayed better here than in the first movie where they were more spontaneous, chasing, killing, and eating anything they felt like.Negatives: -The scene at the end with the T-Rex rampaging through San Diego made me cringe. I thought it was incredibly pointless and unnecessary, not to mention filled with corny lines and clichés. The story could just as easily have found it's conclusion on the island. Come on Spielburg, you can do better than that. -While I thought the acting was pretty good in this movie, it just wasn't superb like what we saw in the first. The interactions between Malcolm, Grant, Ellie, and Hammond were what made the first film so great. We only see this type of interaction briefly and sparsely in The Lost World. -And finally the most irritating thing about this movie was the occasional corny lines, and improbable occurrences. Such as the scene towards the end where Kelly performs a gymnastics feat in front of a stationary, awe-struck raptor before knocking the 100-200 pound predator off it's feet and clear through a wooden wall where it is conveniently impaled by huge splinters.Overall, it was a valiant effort that managed to produce some substance. In no means a failure, it simply just didn't live up to the incredibly high standards set by it's predecessor.

550,futureUApilot,"Good movie, but not a classic",6,20 November 2007,"After watching the first Jurassic Park I had high hopes for this sequel. Perhaps I set too high of an expectation because the film did not thrill me. It's still worth the watch, but doesn't compare to the first film's level of ""classicness"" (not a word, but certainly a thing.) What disappointed me the most was how the makers of the movie did not keep with the same ideas that were set in the first movie. The Raptors for example. In the first movie they were feared so much due to their group hunting characteristics and how intelligent they were. This movie contained more ""solo hunts"" by the raptors. Also when they had the opportunity to eat the doctor, they ended up fighting with each other and not concentrating on their task at hand. It seemed like a cheap way of saving her life, but that may just be me.Another thing that disappointed me was the T'Rex. Instead of always being feared whenever it was on the screen as it was in the first movie, this sequel seemed to let it be more docile and not attack with as much fury as the first movie. It seemed there was a lot of times where the characters of the movie were pinned somewhere, with the face of the T'Rex or the Raptors a mere few feet from them, yet the dinos could not quite reach them. That kind of anxiety is good, if used in moderation. In this movie it was used way too much.In exception to these few problems, the movie is actually very entertaining. It provides a lot of good excitement and action along with eye-popping special effects and a developed story line.

I have two pet peeves though: When Nick's sympathetic action to heal the baby dinosaur's leg put his, Ian, and Sarah's life in jeopardy and made the would-be rescuer become a T-rex snack; and when John Hammond pontificates his speech about life and ""how they must work with the Costa Rican government"" to preserve the land and the dinosaurs- that's a nice political deflection which means they screwed up but can act like the heroes by naming another source as possible culprits.",The Lost World - Jurassic Park

Okay number 1 was ground breaking and put dinosaurs on the map but number one was more like an amusement park thrill ride. That is basically what it was a theme park gone wrong with the dinosaurs getting out. To me jurassic park III never happened. They killed off the T rex within the first half hour to replace it with a spineous rex! the lost world brought the intensity full scale they are in the jungle with raptors and T rexs all around them and no fences for protection they are literally in the peoples faces! lost world showed you how vicious raptors are.they didn't open doors but they were relentless same with the t rexes. Just the atmosphere of number two was more suspenseful in the fact that the were in the wild with the monsters. the dinosaurs in number 1 and 3 were not as aggressive. jeff goldblum did a superb job in number two as the leading man.

562,grainfed,Fun Movie with Clichéd Story Line,6,12 April 2013,"I hadn't saw The Lost World: Jurassic Park in theaters as I did the 1st installment JP. I still enjoyed the sequel, but maybe it was just as well I saw it on video.The storyline is a fuse of Aliens meets Godzilla. It's similarities to Aliens is pretty pronounced -- same ""monster/alien versus man"", with corporate profit-focused greedy entities and egos skewing decision-making to make innocent protagonist's lives even more miserable. And the ensuing drama plays out for our entertainment. Throw in the ""we-are-surrounded, all-systems-are-down, and-we-must-survive-another-2-days before-the-rescue-team-arrives"" cliché for good measure. The only thing missing is a face-hugger or chest-burst scene.I will give credit for some exciting nail-biter scenes. Some scenes however, are drawn out way too long, almost to a tortured length for suspense. It's never good when the scenes are so long you want to swear at the characters for being so klutzy, stupid or incompetent, and just get on with it already.The Jurassic Park series of movies are based on Michael Crichton's book, which is quite dark. I had a feeling Spielberg didn't know how to approach JP, in terms of the level of violence. It just seemed Spielberg wanted to make a kid-friendly movie with dinosaurs, with a little entertainment thrown in for fun.I'm sure it's a dilemma every director/studio must contend with: Do we have gratuitous violence in the movie, get an R-rating and make less box-office money? Or do we bastardize and water-down the book, leave out scenes entirely, and play up the kid-friendly nature of the violent story-line? It would seem Spielberg went with the latter. JP had a PG rating, which for many parents was an inappropriate rating for kids. Could you imagine Aliens with a PG rating?I won't open this can of worms here, but there is something to be said for how movies are rated, and whether there is politics and, of course, money involved. Me thinks this was the case for JP. Even the name of the movie was misleading to maximize movie goer attendance. How many times have you heard a mother ask her kids ""Who wants to go to the park?!"" Going to see ""Jurassic Park"" seemed so natural to take your kids, right??TLW goes a little darker than JP. And appropriately, is designated a PG-13 rating. It would seem they were still struggling to make this dark story palatable for the widest audience possible. But let's face it, many scenes you will witness water running red with blood. Or human limbs being torn apart with big teeth. Not very far off from Aliensjust minus the chest-burster.I wasn't going to mention this, but it would be a shame NOT to mention it: In the movie, Jeff Goldblum (Dr. Ian Malcolm) has a black daughter. I think that statement is almost an internet meme now. There is no explanation for it, but casting like that does trigger some head-scratching. If there was a black couple that had an Asian daughter, it would be equally as curious -- you would want to know the background story. And judging from the amount of chatter about this topic, I would say casting like that does a disservice to the story line -- It only serves to distract.Case in point: I recall watching ""The Matrix Reloaded"" with an Asian friend. After the movie she mentioned there weren't enough Asians in the film. Let's be honest -- there were many Asians cast in TMR, but she argued there ""weren't enough"". Did she notice anything else about the movie? How about the lighting? The cinematography? The dialog and script writing? The editing? Character development? Nope. She was focused on counting the ratio of Asians, Indians, blacks and whites cast in each role. Oy.Near the end of TLW, Spielberg pays homage to Godzilla, replete with Japanese men running for their lives down a city street. My Asian friend would approve. As would VelociRaptors who were well represented throughout the film. The only group I could see complaining about the movie are the T-Rex, as I'm sure they are fed up being stereotyped and judged as blood-thirsty killers.Over and out.",The Lost World - Jurassic Park
563,BroccolliTatoo,The Lost World,10,28 August 2005,"Man, I have to say this is one of the best movies I've seen. It's filled with great action, The San Diego part at the end was great, my only complaint is not many people give it credit, it did mighty well for a sequel.Well other than that i give this a 9 out of 10 for drama, action, and some comedy.The characters are great, an all star cast of Juliane Moore, Jeff Goldblum, Vince Vaughn, and Sir Richard Attenbourgh, It takes place on an island different than Isla Nublar, Isla Sorna is what it is called, In an island chain called Las Cinco Muertas, or The Five Deaths, huh I can see why.New dinosaurs are cool, like the Parasauralophus, Stegosaurus, Pachycepholosaurus, Apatosaurus, and Pteranodon.The baby T-Tex was cute, The Bull T-Tex(The Daddy)was awesome!!!Especially in the San Diego Part, That one always keeps me on the edge of my seat.All in all one of my favorite movies!!",The Lost World - Jurassic Park
564,igornolascorm,The definition of insanity (Or: why some movies are better off as childhood memories),4,27 June 2015,"So, tonight I've watched The Lost World: Jurassic Park. I've previously watched this movie when I was a child, with little to no critical sense, and I remember loving it. Words cannot describe how disappointed I was after rewatching it. When compared to the first Jurassic Park, this movie is a like bad joke. And even without comparison basis (which is almost impossible, given that the first Jurassic Park is amazing and you can't just take it out of your head while watching the sequel), watching The Lost World is just painful. But the worst thing is, at first, it looks promising. Hey, we have Ian Malcolm, John Hammond, Lex and Tim! Remember all these characters you loved from the first movie? So, guess what? Out of the four, three will disappear after the opening sequence on Hammond's mansion and the one who won't will become our protagonist. ""Well, that's promising"", the viewer thinks. ""Dr. Malcolm was one of the best characters on the first movie. That can't be bad!"". Guess what, it was. Here, Malcolm doesn't have a third of the charisma he had on the first movie, and the rest of the characters are just plain dull. They're not deep, funny or likable at all. While watching the movie, you're completely apathetic to the people in danger. The only character you don't want to die is Malcolm, and that's because you knew him from the previous movie, because otherwise, he'd be as uninteresting as the rest of the characters. The screenplay, the story itself, the cast and the CGI are way worst than they were on the first film. And all the good stuff we got from it was brought by nostalgia: Water rippling when the T-Rex approaches, kids viewing the dinosaur's eye by a window, the Jurassic Park gates, John Williams' theme... just cheap attempts to buy the viewers by remembering them of little things they loved from the first movie. You know, I remember a video game line that claimed that ""The definition of insanity is doing the same thing over and over again"". If that's true, the crew of ""The Lost World: Jurassic Park"" was not 100% insane while working on this picture. Because, yes, they did some of the same stuff, but this time, it didn't worked.",The Lost World - Jurassic Park
565,hamngoldman,Probably the only worthy sequel in the Jurassic Park series.,7,10 July 2018,"The Lost World follows the same logic of most big budged sequels, bigger is better and louder. Unfortionaly, while it does not come close to the perfection that was ""Jurassic Park"" and it does miss a few targets along the way, it's still one hell of a fun ride with a winning performance by Jeff Goldblum and a scene stealing performance the late Pete Postlethwaite. Add Spielberg's directing, Sam Winston's dynamic Dinosaurs effects and some of the scariest scenes in the entire Jurassic series, then you have a sequel that is truly worthy of the name Jurassic Park. Too bad the sequels that followed did not have this film's playful showmanship to try to bring something more to the table.",The Lost World - Jurassic Park
566,marky-05926,Best Jurassic Park Movie,9,17 June 2015,"I personally think that Jurassic Park 2 was the best movie of the trilogy, having not seen Jurassic World.The CGI effects in this movie are very superb and the action scenes are played out very well.Jeff Goldblum does a very good portrayal of his previous character Dr. Ian Malcolm,from the first Jurassic Park in this movie, taking a main character role this time around.There's a lot more action in this film than the first one, and there are definitely some parts of the film that will keep you on the edge of your seat more so than the first film.Personally I felt this was a much more entertaining film in the first Jurassic Park and should be treated as such. The constant action and suspense kept me interested throughout the entire movie.If you have not seen any of the Jurassic Park sequels, I recommend that you watch this film as you will definitely not regret it if you are into action, suspense and of course... dinosaurs.",The Lost World - Jurassic Park
567,ourlostcause,Average until the end,5,27 July 2005,"I am a huge fan of the original Jurassic Park. It's 12 years later and I still think the FX are better than half the movies I see previews for. The problem with JP 2 is the casting, the plot, and the ending of the movie. First of all Malcom's daughter is ANNOYING and was the equivalent of Jar Jar Binks, that's the major issue with casting. I'm a fan of Vince Vaughn but the whole Green Peace thing is just stupid to me and added no relevance to the plot. The plot was also a tad bit shaky. Ingen ='s good, Jurassic Park in America ='s bad because after the original who would be that ignorant. The ending is my final problem. What the holy be Jesus was the writer thinking, a T-Rex in San Francisco, their would be no grounds for a sequel. No grounds because how could anyone forget a frigging T-Rex.",The Lost World - Jurassic Park
568,vs_imdb,it could be great only if it wasn't really bad,3,6 August 2006,"""The Lost World: Jurassic Park"" is a film that had the potential to be great, but for some reason turned out to be really bad. Here is why: Dr. Ian Malcolm's girlfriend Dr. Sarah Harding went to the island without warning the good doctor even knowing what happened there (not to mention the coincidence of the Dr. Ian having a girlfriend related to the Jurassic Park subject); it's ridiculous that Dr. Ian's daughter could have been hidden in the RV that long without no one knowing; it's stupid how the characters say what they do just for the audience interest (Nick Van Owen is the garage and Dr. Sarah Harding, when she appears in the island); they where so well equipped that not even the radio worked; they had only one dart rifle (a vital protection instrument in a supposedly hostile environment); Eddie Carr is one of the stupidest characters in film history and he didn't knew nothing about field operations (his job) and even the way he died was stupid; what do you call to a bunch of people that are about to die, ask for burgers and think that that is normal?; is it normal when a group of mercenaries switches to commando mode trough a dinosaur stampede (or even an animal stampede? for that matter); is it normal to be listening to Mexican music when you are being hunted by killing dinosaurs?; is it normal that a super cargo ship can go from a Costa Rica island trough the North Pacific Ocean to a specific harbor in the US without someone running it (that's what I call a autopilot or maybe the dinosaurs that ate the crew jumped overboard because they didn't had a green card); and goes on and on... The point is that to be entertaining it doesn't need to be stupid and this was. It's completely not in the style of Steven Spielberg. I suppose even great directors have bad movies.",The Lost World - Jurassic Park
569,Jaztee,"I love this, i love the book even more!",8,4 December 2006,"I've seen the original Jurassic Park for about thousand times, but this i've only seen once, and that was last summer. When i watched it, i thought that it can't be that good, because it's sequel, but it actually was pretty good. About a month ago, i started also reading the books, which in my opinion, are better than the movie. When you read the book, you realize that both of the movies are missing parts and going WAY too fast. Then, from the biological side, Compys are introduced as small little whiners that are harmless, except that they'll just jump on you. *Spoiler from the book* Hammond is killed by the compys in original JP. I don't like the style that the movie loaned plots from King Kong, it was actually pretty stupid, but the part when they're at the island, is VERY exciting.",The Lost World - Jurassic Park
570,romeoaurelian,One of the most underrated films of all time!,10,21 April 2018,"I always loved this film and I never knew why until I saw the review of it by Klayton Fioriti on youtube.
Remember the butterfly effect that Ian Malcolm (Jeff Goldblum) explains to Ellen Sattler (Laura Dern) in the first film? Well, we are seeing this effect in The Lost World via Nick van Owen character played by Vince Vaughn.
This film has two opposite characters, the big game hunter white man Roland Tembo (Pete Postlewaite) and van Owen, the hunter who hunts for trophy and pleasure and the envirnonmentalist who wants to save the dinos. 
Seems like the typical bad guy vs good guy fight, right?
Wrong!This film blurs the line of right and wrong and it is so ambitious in its filmmaking that even today the effects hold really, really well!I highly recommend the film! If Aliens was to Alien the different take and style, so is The Lost World to Jurassic Park.10/10",The Lost World - Jurassic Park
