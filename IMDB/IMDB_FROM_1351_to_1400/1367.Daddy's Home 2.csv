0,SnoopyStyle,one too many daddy,5,29 April 2018,"Brad (Will Ferrell) and Dusty (Mark Wahlberg) are now the best of friends, co-parenting their kids together. Sara (Linda Cardellini) is leery of exotic Karen (Alessandra Ambrosio) and the influence of Karen's spoiled daughter Adrianna over her daughter Megan. When Megan complains about splitting time in two homes over Christmas, the dads decide to spend the holidays together at a beautiful cabin set up by Kurt. Kurt (Mel Gibson) is Dusty's machismo womanizing absentee dad and Don (John Lithgow) is Brad's touchy kissy feely dad. Dylan has a crush on a girl in the neighboring cabin and is teased by Adrianna and Megan. When Dusty angers Brad, Brad invites Adrianna's daddy Roger (John Cena) to the cabin. The first movie is not my favorite comedy. There are problems with it but I grew to like the pairing of Ferrell and Wahlberg. This one basically adds three more dads but it only really needs two. It's not who you think. It only needs Gibson and Cena. Lithgow is awkward. I did not find his character to be funny or even necessary. In fact, it may be better for Brad's mother to show up instead which would ignite a funny romance with Kurt. That would be a much more interesting story with more potential. Cena needs to show sooner so that his chemistry with the cast can develop. I don't really like Gibson any more as an actor but at least, he fits this role. There are some interesting and even slightly funny moments but overall, this is a weak comedy. Dylan's crush is symptomatic of this movie. It has good potential in the beginning but at the end, it's handled badly which deprives the film of any real humor.",Daddy's Home 2
1,Prismark10,Daddy's Christmas holidays,5,18 February 2018,"I am not sure the world was asking for a sequel to Daddy's Home but here it is.Dusty (Mark Wahlberg) and Brad (Will Ferrell) the two contrasting dads from the first movie have made up and remained friends for the sake of the various kids and step kids. For the Christmas season they plan to holiday together in the woods but they will be joined by their own dads. Kurt (Mel Gibson) who is Dusty's gruff, conservative, womanising ex astronaut dad and and Don (John Lithgow) who is Brad's more sensitive, liberal dad.Of course Kurt is horrified with Brad and Don's behaviour but Dusty initially wants little to do with him as he senses that he wants to create division.The film has its fair share of infantile and stupid humour. Brad creating havoc with the decorations or cutting the mobile phone tower down.The script remains very uneven and also very unfocussed. I felt the script was written on the fly once the concept of Mel Gibson playing Wahlberg's dad was greenlit.I thought the film was patchy yet surprisingly also funny in places especially at the latter part.",Daddy's Home 2
2,nogodnomasters,Co-Dads,4,27 November 2017,"The daddy rivalry that made the first film funny is over as we have moved on to co-dads. They decide to spend Christmas together as a single family than as two families and then they get news the grand dads are coming for Christmas, most likely because Sean Anders scripted this film in the cubicle next to ""Bad Mom's Christmas."" Mel Gibson plays Mark Wahlberg's father and it was as bad as it sounds. John Lithgow is Will Ferrell's father, a polar opposite of Mel Gibson.The writers quickly ran out of formula humor for this group and felt they needed to bring in John Cena to place Wahlberg in Will Ferrell's position, something that worked out to be far less funny than it sounds. Gibson badgering his son and their bad relationship took up the bulk of the film.Guide: No F-words, sex, or nudity.",Daddy's Home 2
3,kosmasp,Who's your daddy?,7,24 March 2018,"You always have to up the ante. So after the initial movie and the fight about who is going to be the dad ... now we get the dads of the dads. And some nice actors got involved in this. Whatever you may think of Mel Gibson and his recent rants and missbehavings, he still got it. And John Lithgow always is funny and it's so fitting for him to play this role.There is not really a high standard here. This is pretty simple stuff and the jokes are not really philosophical. If you can ""lower"" yourself or just don't care about being or having a certain standard you will be entertained by this movie. It is easy but also hard and I get if some people hate this. Comedy is not always easy and juvenille jokes can feel childish - in this case they aim to be",Daddy's Home 2
4,jboothmillard,Daddy's Home 2,4,5 May 2020,"The first movie was a near disappointing, slightly boring and almost unlaughable mess, the critics gave this sequel more favourable reviews, and I was certainly interested to see the star of Braveheart in it, directed by Sean Anders (Sex Drive, That's My Boy, Horrible Bosses 2). Basically, Brad Whitaker (Will Ferrell) and Dusty Mayron (Razzie nominated Mark Wahlberg) have been friends for some time now, and take it turns to be fathers to Dusty's children Megan (Scarlett Estevez) and Dylan (Owen Wilder Vaccaro). Dusty is remarried with doctor and writer Karen (Alessandra Ambrosio), and is stepfather to Adrianna (Didi Costine), Karen's daughter. With the holidays approaching, Brad and Dusty decide to do away with having two separate Christmases, after Megan embarrassed them both in a school recital, and instead decide to have a ""together Christmas."" One night, Dusty receives a call from his father, a tough fighter pilot/astronaut, that he will be coming for the holidays. Brad is also surprised to learn that his father, an overbearing and over-cheerful dad, will also be coming. Megan and Dylan warmly embrace Brad's father Don (John Lithgow), as he visited many times in the past, while Dusty's father Kurt (Razzie winning Mel Gibson) has not seen the children since they were toddlers. Kurt is jealous of the affection the kids show to Don, so he decides to rent a large cabin for them to stay in during Christmas. Brad and Dusty's friendship and fatherhood is put to the test by Kurt's interfering. Brad's wife Sara (Linda Cardellini) also tries to bond with Karen but is surprised by some of Karen's actions, including shoplifting clothes from a store. Sara starts noticing why Don never showed up without Brad's mother. Dylan develops a crush on a young girl named Casey (Yamilah Saravong), staying in the cabin next door, causing Megan and Adrianna to constantly tease him in front of her. Brad gives him some ""advice,"" and Dusty interjects giving him ""the talk"" about relationships, which annoys Brad, as Dusty was to do so. The family want a Christmas tree, but all tress available are too small, so they illegally enter a private property to cut one down. Brad mistakenly cuts an electric tower, thinking it is a tree, and is electrocuted, but he recovers. The family next go bowling, and the children pay a visit to Santa, where Kurt suggests Dylan could ask Santa for a shotgun. The men take the children hunting, during which Dylan changes his mind about killing a turkey, and Megan accidentally shoots Kurt in the shoulder. But while he is wounded on the ground, Megan does manage to shoot two turkeys dead, surprising and pleasing Kurt, who is taken to hospital. Brad, Dusty, Don and Kurt go to a comedy club, where Dusty sees Kurt meeting a woman at the bar and leaving with her, which annoys Dusty. Brad enters Don to do some improvisational comedy, and Dusty chooses the subject of a husband confronting his cheating wife for the skit. As the skit progresses, it is revealed that Don has separated from his wife a few months ago. Brad is upset as he knows Dusty chose the topic of couple's separating deliberately, so he gets back at him by invited Adrianna's biological father, Roger (John Cena), to the cabin for Christmas. The entire family takes part in a Christmas manger representation. Brad and Dusty have a fight about who plays Joseph, and the gathered crowd are broken up by this, and the children who have gotten drunk drinking eggnog. Instead of Dusty fighting Brad, he almost comes to blows with Roger, and Don is repeatedly hit in the face with ice balls. On Christmas Day, the families, depressed, all pack up to leave. But they are forced back to town when a blizzard occurs, and the only place to go is a cinema, to watch a holiday themed action movie starring Liam Neeson. When the power cuts out during the movie, the families go to the lobby where each of the men confront each other about the secrets, lies, and attitudes, but eventually they patch their differences. Dylan meanwhile plucks up the courage to approach the girl he has a crush on, to kiss her, but instead kisses Adrianna. Dusty tells Roger that loving Adrianna means loving her real father as well since he is also part of the family. Roger feeling upset almost leaves without Adriana but has a change of heart when everyone breaks out into song, singing Band Aid's ""Do They Know It's Christmas?"", and decides to stay. Sometime later, at the airport, Don and Kurt are preparing to leave. Kurt heads with Don up the terminal escalators, where he reveals to Don that he switched tickets and they are spending New Year's in Las Vegas. As Brad's mother's flight arrives, Dusty and Brad discover that Brad's new stepdad is Chesley ""Sully"" Sullenberger (as himself), the ""Miracle on the Hudson"" pilot. Dusty appears to be happy to see him, as he and Brad watched the Tom Hanks movie Sully. But Brad is upset and says that Sully will never replace his father, because Sully has only one great personal story, whereas his father has many. Also starring Bill Burr as Jerry, Jose Guns Alves as Security Guard and Oscar Wahlberg (Mark's nephew) as Roberto C. Fishman Pratt. Ferrell is a bit more rounded and Wahlberg is much less smarmy than before, Gibson is a little much at times being the tough-guy dad and Lithgow is alright as the overly nice dad. This sequel is much more like what the first movie should have been, much more bickering between the leads, the addition of the co-stars as fellow fathers is welcome, the slapstick moments are a little lessened, and the competitive stuff remains, the Christmas stuff is fine, this did make me titter much more than the previous film, but it is only slightly better, an average seasonal comedy. Okay!",Daddy's Home 2
5,paul_haakonsen,"Prepare yourself for more laughs, because the daddies (and their daddies) are back...",7,10 June 2018,"I was really looking forward to this sequel, because I really enjoyed the first movie tremendously.And when I saw that they added Mel Gibson and John Lithgow to the cast list as well, then what was there not to like all the more?Luckily, this movie actually kept up to speed with its predecessor, and there was every bit as much fun and laughs here as in the first movie.The characters in the movie are great, and they are nicely portrayed by a great ensemble of actors and actresses.There are lots of hilarious situations in the entire movie, and I was laughing hard many times throughout the movie.So, if you enjoyed the first ""Daddy's Home"" movie, then you definitely have to watch part 2 as well. Because it is every bit as fun and entertaining.",Daddy's Home 2
6,studioAT,Even more daddy's,4,26 September 2019,"First of all, this is a Christmas film, so just bear that in mind.I didn't think the first film was worthy of a sequel, but of course anything that makes a profit in Hollywood gets a sequel, so here we go.There's more I liked here than the original, now that the constant one-upmanship between Ferrell and Wahlberg's characters for the most part is over, but it still has a few too many pointless scenes, lewd moments and is overlong.If you can get past all that though you'll find a decent enough alternative Christmas film.",Daddy's Home 2
7,zardoz-13,"A Good Follow-Up to the original ""Daddy's Day""",8,12 December 2017,"""Sex Drive"" writer & director Sean Anders scored a box office hit back in 2015 when he cast slapstick comic Will Ferrell and smash-up action hero Mark Wahlberg respectively as stepdad and dad in ""Daddy's Home"" (2015), a boisterous comedy of errors about parenthood. Happily, Anders's Yuletide sequel ""Daddy's Home 2,"" reunites most of the original cast, except for Hannibal Buress as Griff the handyman, Thomas Haden Church as Brad's boss Leo Holt, and Brad's pestilent-looking pet pooch Tumor. Anders and ""That's My Boy"" writer John Morris have duplicated the first film's facetious rivalry and escalated everything to a new level as granddads Mel Gibson and John Lithgow loom on the horizon. Although it isn't as deliriously daffy as ""Daddy's Home,"" ""Daddy's Home 2"" still delivers more than enough amusing moments to keep you in stitches. Will Ferrell performs his usual accident-prone antics, some reminiscent of those in the first film. Moreover, Brad gets second chance to croak momentarily after electrocuting himself under different circumstances. Indeed, you cannot truly savor some of the sight gags in ""Daddy's Home 2"" unless you've seen the original. This dysfunctional family farce sets the fathers against the grandfathers, and the situations are often sidesplitting. Ferrell's encounter with an out-of-control snow blower on the rampage evokes memories of his disastrous motorcycle ride in ""Daddy's Home."" As Dusty's father Kurt, Mel Gibson is grouchy and gray-haired, and the tension simmering between Kurt and Dusty is palpable. ""Daddy's Home 2"" charts the changes in Kurt and Dusty's relationship as estranged son and father. The adage about 'like father, like son' applies to them. Anders and Morris make Dusty's dad Kurt an obnoxious, womanizing Grinch with no qualms about indulging in a dirty joke in front of the grandkids. Compared with Dusty's emotionally-immune but masculine patriarch, Brad's dad, Don is a hopeless crybaby about his son. Greeting each other at the airport, Brad and Don hug and kiss passionately on the lips without shame! When the fathers aren't bickering with each other, they discover Dusty's son Dylan is experiencing love at first sight, and the dads rush to furnish him fatherly advice.
 
As ""Daddy's Home 2"" unfolds, Dusty Mayron (Mark Wahlberg of ""The Departed"") and Brad Whitaker (Will Ferrell of ""The House"") have bonded as dad and step-dad. Now, they are now best buddies who no longer resort to trying to one-up man each other in front of the kids to win their allegiance. Mind you, Dusty has mellowed considerably. He has taken over the position at the school that Doris had in the original when she scolded parents about keeping their cars within the traffic cones when they deposited and picked-up their children. As Christmas approaches, Dylan (Owen Vaccaro of ""Mother's Day"") and Megan (Scarlett Estevez of ""And Then There Was You"") complain about all the back and forth driving to different houses that will ruin the holiday. Brad comes up with a novel idea, and Dusty agrees with him that they should throw one big party at one house for everybody. Dylan's cell phone rings, and he is excited to hear that Dusty's father Kurt has rung him. Suddenly, Dusty confronts the uncomfortable prospect of spending Christmas with his father. Later, Brad phones his father, retired postal carrier Don Whitaker (John Lithgow of ""Interstellar ""), and his dad promises to visit them during the holidays. When Kurt and Don show up, the relationship between Dusty and Brad spins out of control again. Chiefly, Kurt makes life difficult for Dusty. Kurt believes Dusty has forsaken his masculinity to work with Brad and his own ex-wife Sara (Linda Cardellini of ""Brokeback Mountain"") concerning his kids. Kurt has a low opinion of both Brad and Don, and he hates to see the Whitakers manipulating Dusty's children. Meantime, Don is overwhelmed to see Brad with whom he hasn't been in contact in less than a month.
 
Kurt decides everybody would be better accommodated if they celebrated Christmas elsewhere rather than at Brad's house. Kurt books them into a picturesque mansion atop a snow-swept hill at a ski resort. An Internet marketplace and hospitality service, Airbub lets people either lease or rent lodging for vacations. Everybody piles into two separate SUVs and cruises off on a five-hour drive that ends at the driveway of a spacious house in a winter wonderland. No sooner have they arrived than Brad tangles with a runaway snow blower that destroys all their elaborate Christmas decorations scattered across in the yard and on the roof of the house. Meantime, Kurt criticizes Dusty not only for letting Brad and Sara dictate to him when he may visit his daughter and son, but also his relationship with his step-daughter Adrianna. Kurt's intrigues and Brad calamities constitute the high points of this farce that isn't entirely family friendly considering some of its profane, PG-13 dialogue. Predictably, Brad makes a buffoon of himself. At one point, he cuts down a tree on public land that has a cell phone tower attached to it! During their caper through the woods to find a Christmas tree, the family loses track of Don, but they manage to rescue him later after a pack of wolves are swarming around him. 
 
Will Ferrell doesn't spend the entire time making an idiot out of himself. Nevertheless, his clowning will keep you in stitches. Mel Gibson looks like he had a blast as Dusty's disreputable dad. He does his best to turn Dusty against Brad again, but eventually must face the fact that he wasn't a good enough role model father for Dusty. Mark Wahlberg divides his time between harassing Ferrell and contending with his father and John Cena. Cena plays the father of Dusty's step-daughter Adrianna, and he doesn't see eye-to-eye with Dusty on the matter of raising her. The funniest joke near the end concerns a fictionalized action movie entitled ""Missile Tow"" starring Liam Neeson. ""Daddy's Home 2"" succeeds far better as a comedy sequel than a heartwarming Christmas movie.",Daddy's Home 2

Occasionally hilarious follow up to the first film with comedy team Ferrell & Wahlberg as the odd couple dads attempting to raise their children/step-children with their visiting fathers (jerk Gibson and over-affectionate Lithgow) enlisting their families for a Christmas vacation away from home that only pits the father/sons against one another and the usual shenanigans involved (best bit involving a thermostat setting).",Daddy's Home 2
10,neil-476,Far more fun than it ought to have been,7,8 May 2018,"Silly, soft second husband Brad (Will Ferrell) and macho irresponsible Dusty (Mark Wahlberg) are co-dadding harmoniously and have decided to have a single Christmas all together so that the kids don't feel conflicted. Arriving for Christmas are Don (John Lithgow), Brad's Dad, full of physical demonstrations of affection and every bit as soppy as his son, and Kurt (Mel Gibson), Dusty's aggressive, insensitive, rather cruel father.Here is a sequel even fuller of caricature characters than the original. None of the 4 males is even halfway believable. Wahlberg is the only one who doesn't overact massively. The plot is paper thin and unbelievable, and the climactic scene is idiotic.Yet it is an amiable experience because these silly characters are all quite likeable, even the unpleasant Kurt. There is amusement along the way. And I must say that Wahlberg's Bono moment, carefully set up earlier in the film, is a surprise when it comes, and is as heartwarming as it is ridiculous.This is one of those films that I shouldn't have enjoyed, but did.Oh, and it doesn't contain any F-words - imagine that!",Daddy's Home 2
11,ferguson-6,mel makes mayhem,6,9 November 2017,"Greetings again from the darkness. It's rare for a sequel to be a better film than the original, and we are entering unicorn territory when dealing with comedy sequels improving on the first film. So hearing that most of the original cast is back for material from the same creative team – director Sean Anders and his co-writers Brian Burns and John Morris – well, expectations would normally be pretty low. However, all of that changes when we learn of two cast/character additions: Mel Gibson and John Lithgow.After the fierce daddy competition between Brad (Will Ferrell) and Dusty (Mark Wahlberg) in the original two years ago, this film picks up with what looks to be a very healthy co-dad environment for all involved. In comedy-based cinema, the best way to disrupt a happy family synergy is to introduce the Christmas season and the sure-to- follow family turmoil. Enter Mel Gibson as Dusty's estranged dad, and John Lithgow as Brad's so-close-it's-too-close dad  and let the holiday escapades begin.At its core, this is an observational comedy about the contrast between old school and contemporary fatherhood - machismo vs emotionally open. Mel Gibson is key to the story working on multiple levels, and his performance is a reminder of his immense screen talent (in spite his personal life issues). His character's idea of being a father has been around for many generations. Toughen up the kids and make sure they are strong and independent. Keep those emotions close to the vest. On the other side is John Lithgow and his over-hugging and blubbering true feelings approach. The familiar supporting cast holds up their end admirably. Linda Cardellini and Alessandra Ambrosio are back as Brad's and Dusty's wives, respectively. Scarlett Estevez, Owen Vaccaro, and Didi Costine are back as the kids – each with their own quirks and growing pains. Even John Cena returns as Adrianna's biological father, and to deliver one of the film's best punchlines, as well as a bit that might forever ruin Christmas caroling for you.The trailer, as with most comedies these days, gives away too many of the funny moments, so don't expect any additional spoilers here. There is some comedy brilliance mixed in with the cheesy, over-the- top slapstick (a snowblower scene that could have easily worked in Christmas VACATION almost 30 years ago). The brilliant moments are often the quieter ones, and they focus on parenting, family, and the challenges of childhood. There is a surprising and unusual cameo near the end, and the movie is well executed to satisfy its built-in audience, while also capitalizing on those who enjoy (and/or need) a good, clean comedy at Christmas time.",Daddy's Home 2
12,FlashCallahan,Dad takes a holiday.......,7,19 January 2018,"Dusty and Brad join forces to make Christmas perfect for the children. Their newfound partnership soon gets put to the test when Dusty's old-school dad and Brad's gentle father arrive. After a sudden change in plans, the four men decide to take the kids to a luxury resort for a fun-filled getaway that turns chaos.It's a case of 'if it ain't broke, don't fix it, just rehash the same jokes, and send the characters on holiday'.Normally, this would spell disaster for a sequel, showing that the writer is scraping the barrel of a sound idea. Maybe it's true, but then there is the ingenious move of the inclusion of Gibson as Wahlberg's father, which is the sole reason to watch the film.Even though he's been involved in some questionable acts in the past, one cannot deny the presence he has on screen, and there is a lot of method in his role, as one can believe that he hasn't put a lot of work into his character.Gibson here is a misogynistic control freak, scoffing at his sons parental techniques, and pointing out his every flaw. He's a delight to watch, and lifts the film from the mediocre Christmas Shlock it's so dangerously veering toward.Ferrell and Wahlberg don't have the same competitiveness here that they did in the first film, which is a shame, because even though it hints at a total meltdown, it never really materialises, despite them being at loggerheads for most of the final act.Lithgow is a delight as Ferrells over loving father, the polar opposite to Gibson, and his interaction with the other characters is funny to begin with, but like his character, begins to grate quite rapidly.Add recycled jokes from the first film, a musical number at the end, and a Liam Neeson film I really want to see made, and you have a decent Christmas film that doesn't try to be anything other than a marketing ploy from the studio to make money from a holiday.Fun because of Gibson, but they could have tried harder.",Daddy's Home 2
13,deloudelouvain,If you don't like Will Ferrell just don't watch this movie and stop whining about it,7,10 March 2018,"Why the haters would even start watching this movie is a mystery to me. If you don't like Will Ferrell then just don't watch this movie because it is the same humor as in all the other movies he's been in. I love Will Ferrell and his stupid humor with his nerdy face, so to me this is a good movie. I thought it was even better then the first one. This time John Lidgow is also in the cast and that's another comedian that makes me laugh all the time. They couldn't have found a better guy to play the father of Will Ferrell. Mel Gibson as the father of Mark Whalberg was also a good match. The story might be a bit dorky but I didn't expect anything else. It's all about the silly humor, and if you're not into that, just skip this movie instead of wasting your time twice by watching it and writing a bad review about it. If you do love that kind of humor I'm sure you will have a couple of good laughs.",Daddy's Home 2
14,Hellmant,Adding Gibson to the cast was brilliant in my opinion!,8,15 November 2017,"'DADDY'S HOME 2': Four Stars (Out of Five) A sequel to the 2015 hit comedy starring Will Ferrell and Mark Wahlberg, as two rival fathers competing for the same children's love. In this follow-up they're now friends, and they have to deal with their own fathers visiting for the holidays, who are also complete opposites as well of course. Mel Gibson and John Lithgow join the cast, as the elder dads, while Linda Cardellini and John Cena also reprise their roles from the original movie. The film was once again directed by Sean Anders, and it was written by Anders and John Morris (the same duo also co-wrote the original, as well as 'HOT TUB TIME MACHINE', 'SEX DRIVE', 'SHE'S OUT OF MY LEAGUE', 'WE'RE THE MILLERS', 'HORRIBLE BOSSES 2', and other hit comedies). This film has received nearly unanimous negative reviews from critics, but it's done really well at the Box Office (and with viewers there). I thought it was pretty funny too actually.Brad and Dusty (Ferrell and Wahlberg) now get along perfectly, and our doing a really effective job co-parenting their kids together. Then both of their fathers, Kurt (Gibson) and Don (Lithgow), decide to visit them for the holidays. Kurt is extremely egotistical, obsessively masculine, and a bit of a sexist asshole. Don is really sweet, kind and friendly. More family drama occurs because of their visit, which causes conflict between Brad and Dusty again as well. Especially when Brad invites the biological father (Cena) of Dusty's stepdaughter over.The movie is frequently very funny. It definitely has some bad jokes in it too, and it's a pretty routine family Christmas comedy, but it's still mostly funny. Adding Gibson to the cast, as the womanizing chauvinistic pig, was brilliant casting in my opinion as well, and he's hilarious in the role. Lithgow is also good in his part too, and Ferrell and Wahlberg are both effective once again too. I actually enjoyed this sequel more than it's predecessor; it seems more packed with quality humor to me, at least in my opinion. It's also more fun that it's set at Christmas (in my opinion as well).",Daddy's Home 2

16,wellthatswhatithinkanyway,"Some missed potential, but still very funny",9,24 December 2017,"STAR RATING: ***** Saturday Night **** Friday Night *** Friday Morning ** Sunday Night * Monday MorningDusty (Mark Wahlberg) and Brad (Will Ferrell), the diametrically opposed dads from the first film, have managed to form a bond for the sake of family unity. But, during the holiday season, their respective dads, Kurt (Mel Gibson) and Don (John Lithgow), older extensions of their off-spring, come over and join them on a winter vacation to a remote retreat in the woods, leading to various comic mishaps and shenanigans.Despite its inspired concept, the original Daddy's Home film from two years ago, was only mildly well received by both critics and the public, but all the same, this festive sequel, reuniting the original lead stars and with returning director Sean Anders, has emerged (and done phenomenally better at the box office!) It's basically an extension of the original, with the same premise, but taking the old adage of 'the apple never falls far from the tree' and introducing us to the main character's parents. Detractors might see this as a desperate ploy that treads all over the originality of the first film, but obviously most others have reacted well to it. And quite rightly so, to be honest.Gibson's a perfect choice of casting as the bad boy father of Dusty, and Lithgow does fit the socks of Brad's cornball dad, the only trouble is I best remember him as merciless villain Eric Qualen in Cliffhanger, and at times this did make his part a problem. The only downside of this decent idea is that it's simply not explored as much as it could have been, and is left out for large parts, in favour of much of the slapstick farce from the last film. But while this is a sad case of wasted potential, the fact is all of it is still just very funny, and in this regard it just works too well to be considered a failure.Comedy sequels generally are greeted with scorn, and with past examples in mind this is understandable, but Daddy's Home 2 is a rare exception, engaging, bittersweet, not overly schmaltzy and all rounded off with an uproarious (and timely) rendition of Band Aid's Feed the World. Really, what more could you want? ****",Daddy's Home 2
17,Pjtaylor-96-138044,"Generally inoffensive, but still worse than I could have possibly imagined.",3,27 December 2017,"I'll preface this by saying that I haven't seen, nor now have any interest in ever seeing, the first film in this odd and unnecessary choice for a franchise, so the fairly complicated family dynamics on display were somewhat lost on me for a fair while until I'd worked out exactly who was who's daddy, something not quite as easy as you'd think considering that there are seemingly more 'steps' in this family than in the Burj Khalifa itself, but once I'd found my footing - or, rather, simply found out it both didn't really matter and I didn't care enough anymore to worry about it - I could finally sit back and simply not enjoy the debacle that ensued. Between trying to convince us that Mel Gibson is quote 'beautiful', a certain heroic pilot isn't beyond the cameo he curiously makes and generally that every single actor involved isn't much better than this - to the point where they can't have been happy with the work they were producing (unless something went really wrong in the edit), the flimsy flick represents a series of seriously misjudged skits simply screaming ""we're trying too hard"" while only producing a single 'meh' emoji's worth of a reaction which all amount to an emotional payoff that's technically sound but seriously undercut by its mysteriously musical management and callously cheesy crescendo - an issue actually present throughout the consistently grating and ham-fisted piece. It may be generally inoffensive, but its still actually much worse than I could have possibly imagined. 3/10",Daddy's Home 2

I was not a fan of the first Daddy's Home, the trailers for this movie did reel we in, but I still had low expectations. I must say, however, that it was an immensely fun comedy with a dedicated cast. The main reason that enthralled me about this movie was John Lithgow and Mel Gibson playing the grandfather's, they did not disappoint. Their characters are the highlight of the film, they are given the best dialogue and have some truly brilliant moments. I will say that it tried to be too family friendly, as was my issue with the first movie. I do not think it is a movie that would generally satisfy a younger audience, there was certainly no one below the age of 18 present when I saw it, so I do not see why they did not just go all the way and make it a proper frat pack comedy, instead of floating in limbo. I must say Will Ferrell really phones it in this time around. Mark Wahlberg is still in great form, but Ferrell looks like he is anticipating his pay check. He does not really shine in comedic moments that someone as funny as him would normally own, his heart just was not there, it felt like he was contractually obligated to be there. Nothing spectacular, but fun nonetheless. Some hilarious moments and a star studded cast, no one is doing their best work here, but Daddy's Home 2 is worth the watch if you are looking for a good comedy, just do not go out of your way to see it. 
Brad and Dusty are made spend Christmas with their fathers, after just getting used to their new co-operative relationship.

Fortunately, the families in this comedy have plenty of activities to keep their dads from their tool-belt.When their daughter declares that she hates Christmas ever since her mother (Linda Cardellini) divorced her father Dusty (Mark Wahlberg) and married Brad (Will Ferrell), the two families decide to spend the holidays together for the first time. But past problems and new revelations threaten to undermine the blended family when Dusty's father (Mel Gibson) and Brad's dad (John Lithgow) show up to celebrate.While it has a sprinkling of serviceable gags that poke fun at the season, overall this ineffective sequel to the average original struggles to make its pap material palatable or even slightly plausible.Besides, even Jesus had two Christmas: one with Mary and Joseph and one with God and his new girlfriend.

Now i really enjoyed the first movie - it was very dumb, mindless but kinda very funny movie. This one is just dumb, mindless and lame. All of these great actors were just having fun with this project and collecting their paychecks - nothing else. Overall, there is nothing else to say about this movie.

22,Platypuschow,Daddy's Home 2: About what you'd expect,6,29 April 2018,"I enjoyed Daddys Home (2015), it was a nice take your brain out comedy that exceeded my low expectations.A sequel is not something I forsaw and upon seeing the trailer I felt this was going to be a blatant cashgrab, and it kind of is.Immediatly I was concerned by the cast additions, I despise both Gibson and Cena but credit where credit is due Gibson was on fine form. The kind of form in fact I haven't seen him in for a good decade! Cena however, still sucked.Wahlberg, Ferrell, Cardellini and Lithgow are great and really make the best of a questionable script. Jokes are predictably hit and miss (More miss than hit), it's full of tack and schmultz and doesn't reach the same level of the original.It's not a complete mess and does manage to deliver the laughs, but considering this is entirely supposed to be a comedy it simply doesn't have enough!Nice try, but let's not make this a trilogy ok?!The Good:Cast are greatLithgow and Gibson are excellentThe Bad:Simply not that funny for the most partAnnoyingly dark in placesSappyThings I Learnt From This Movie:Making out with your step-sister is badLinda Cardellini doesn't know how to age",Daddy's Home 2
23,cruise01,Almost the same as the first with grandfathers and less laughs and less fun.,3,11 November 2017,"Daddy's Home 2 had the potential of being comedic and fun like how the first film was. But like most comedy sequels, this one was a dud with most of the laughs already shown in the trailers. While the rest of the 90 or so minutes being completely a drag and boring. The first film was a lot of fun with the concept of step dad vs. dad with Will Ferrell vs. Mark Wahlberg. They do make a perfect comedic duo. Daddy's Home 2 tries for the cheap laughs and gags but it's less than the first, and the newcomers were a fun addition like Mel Gibson and John Lithgow. But there talent was not enough to save this film. Not even Mark Wahlberg, and Will Ferrell chemistry was good enough to make it worth watching. The plot follows Brad (Will Ferrell) and Dusty (Mark Wahlberg) being codads with their children. Dusty is trying to get along with his resistant stepdaughter who pays too much attention to her phone. While, the kids going back and forth between their stepfather and father becomes a tiresome. They decide to celebrate Christmas together in one household. Then, comes the surprise when Dusty's father (Mel Gibson) calls and says he is coming over. When Dusty and Brad's fathers are coming to visit their grandkids. They decide to go on a holiday retreat to beat having to debate where they are opening gifts and whose house they are having dinner at. Then, that's where the fun begins with Brad and Dusty's parenting is being criticized by their own fathers with Gibson's tough love parenting vs. Lithgow's sensitive compassion parenting comes to play. I love Mark Wahlberg and Will Ferrell chemistry in the first film. Sadly, this sequel fails to generate any laughs or gags. Most of the fun parts were already shown in the trailers. Mel Gibson's character is like a dead beat with jokes about hookers, teaching boys to be tough man and to hunt to provide for their ladies. While the ladies stay in the kitchen and cook. Which caused his granddaughter to take charge and wanting to hunt a turkey and learn how to shoot a rifle. While John Lithgow is a sensitive father figure, that gets emotional at every single thing. But when Dusty's father sees that his stepdaughter is walking all over the parents. He lectures that Dusty needs to lay the hammer with discipline. The film's script is dried out with lacking humor this time with the concept of grandfather vs. grandfather, and who can raise their kids better. But it just wasn't as funny as the first.Overall, Daddy's Home 2 is a terrible film. The script is lacking in humor. There were barely any laughs or gags. The plot was boring. I rate the film 1.5 out of 5 stars. I do not recommend the film unless you are really bored, otherwise I ll consider it as a rental.",Daddy's Home 2
24,Floated2,Lesser than the original,6,2 August 2018,"Daddy's Home 2 is the followup to the hit Daddy's Home released in 2015. This sequel feels more as a sequel than a followup and feels more so done since the original was such a success. The plot is quite thin and predictable, though does have some moments. There are lesser laughs and total enjoyment in this film compared to the original. The addition of Mel Gibson works as his character is enjoyable and brings in several laughs. Overall, Daddy's Home 2 is somewhat of a disappointment but given the reviews this was expected.As a rewatch 06/10/20' opinions remain relatively the same, as in this sequel isn't as good as the original.

25,eddie_baggins,A real cringe-fest,1,3 April 2018,"There are a lot of funny things in life but Daddy's Home 2 isn't one of them.A sequel to a film that was acceptable but not entirely crying out for another chapter, Daddy's Home 2 is one of the most offensively bland and uninspired creations to appear on our cinema screens in some time and marks down an occasion in all of its stars careers in which they are likely to look back on and feel an immense sense of embarrassment and shame in what they helped create.A film in which children flaunting gun controls or getting drunk is supposedly comedy gold or repeated scenes of Will Ferrell kissing John Lithgow on the lips alongside Mel Gibson playing a creepy version of his real life persona being repeated over and over because its seemingly so hilarious, Daddy's Home 2 isn't so bad its good, it's just plain bad and a shocking result for a cast that have proven in times past to be perfectly capable at delivering comedic wins.Most frustratingly, Daddy's Home 2 completely wastes the on screen chemistry between its two leads Ferrell and Wahlberg, who created great things with their first pairing up in The Other Guys and to a lesser extent the first Daddy's Home from 2015 but here in returning director Sean Anders film the two capable performers look tired, bored and like they've failed to disengage auto-pilot and it's likely that the thought of the pay check they were to receive for signing away their dignity was all they needed to get them through this shameful affair.Other performers in the film also fail to fire up proceedings, with Lithgow trying his best but still struggling with an unlikeable character while the Razzie winning Gibson should've known better than to mark his big screen comeback with such a creepy, odd and uninspired role, while the films structuring around a collection of badly done slapstick and creepy scenarios makes you wonder if anyone even read the script before camera's started rolling.Final Say - The very worst kind of Hollywood family comedy, that's inability to create a single genuine laugh or utilise its name brand cast makes it a crime against cinema, Daddy's Home 2 is a shockingly inept experience that's saved from 0 star purgatory purely by a must-see finale that has to be one of cinemas all-time greatest cringe-fests.½ a cup of make-up coco out of 5",Daddy's Home 2

It is so terrible mediocre and made according to a formula which neatly draws each joke between the lines, so not to offend anybody.This comedy is suited for the whole family, but I wouldnt want to watch it as an adult, because the jokes are so boring. But perhaps kids could like it, because the subject of this story is about kids longing to have their divorced parents together at Christmas.There are way better Will Ferrell comedies out there: ""The Other Guys"" or ""Holmes & Watson"" are great, although these 2 comedies are definitely NOT suited for families, because they are pretty gross, but in a really funny way.",Daddy's Home 2

30,jtindahouse,About what was expected,7,19 February 2018,"Early on in the production of 'Daddy's Home 2' there were rumours flying around that this one would start off where the first one finished with John Cena being the main antagonist of the film, and I thought surely they wouldn't go down that route. John Cena has the charisma of a wet sandbag. Plus it would take away from the main selling point these films have which is the chemistry between Mark Wahlberg and Will Ferrell. While he does play a larger part in this film than in the first, he is far from a lead actor in it luckily. They made a wise choice on that front.They did though decide to add Mel Gibson and John Lithgow into the mix and I love this decision. Both were ideally cast (I may have preferred Chevy Chase in Lithgow's role fractionally but I'm okay with the choice they made) and nailed their roles. Gibson in particular is possibly the highlight of the film. It's so refreshing to see him acting in a comedy again because he is a very funny man when he wants to be. The writing lets the film down in places. There are some lazy jokes and scenes where it's quite hard to understand what exactly they were going for. The chemistry between Ferrell and Wahlberg still isn't quite perfected in these films either. They nailed it in 'The Other Guys' but not quite in either of these films. The real surprise in this film though is just how funny the child actors turned out to be. They were funnier than the adults far more often than they were entitled to be. A very pleasant element to the film. All up the film is probably about on par with the original. It plays it surprisingly safe for the most part and it will be hard to seperate the two films in my mind a few years down the track I suspect. Could have been better, could have been worse.",Daddy's Home 2
31,stevendbeard,Slap-Sticky,6,10 November 2017,"I saw ""Daddy's Home 2"", starring Will Ferrell-The House, The Other Guys; Mark Wahlberg-Patriots Day, The Other Guys; John Lithgow-The Accountant, Dreamgirls and Mel Gibson-Machete Kills, Signs. This is a sequel to the 2015 minor hit. Just like the first movie, it depends on how much you like Will's brand of comedy. I am not a big fan of his style-sometimes he is funny but most of the time, he is just too slap-sticky for me. For instance, there is a scene with a snowblower going wild and sucking up Christmas decorations and Will is slammed against the house and drug to the top of the house and then falls to the ground, just like in a cartoon. Anyway, Will & Mark are best buds now, getting along fine and everything-they are even going to celebrate their Christmas together in the same house, instead of going back and forth with the kids. That is when both of their fathers show up for the holidays-John is Will's and Mel is Mark's fathers-and everyone's egos start clashing and pretty soon, Will and Mark are not best buds any more. John Cena, who had a small cameo in the first movie, is in a little bigger cameo here. He shows up near the end again but has a little more screen time-he even gets to sing a song with Will, Mark and Mel. As the end credits start, there is a scene with Mel and after the end of the credits, John has a scene-Lithgow not Cena. It's rated ""PG-13"" for suggestive material and language and has a running time of 1 hour & 40 minutes.

33,iquine,Strikes the Right Cord for Me,8,24 December 2018,"(Flash Review)Yah, this is in the dumb comedy genre, which there are many terrible ones as well as several mean-spirited ones, but this one as well as the first Daddy's Home worked for me and gave my belly a hearty jiggle and didn't bury the positive theme; as many tend to do. This time Ferrell and Wahlberg are getting along as co-fathers and now come the holidays. Enter the grandfathers. Gibson is the opposite of Lithgow where Gibson is an alpha male and Lithgow the hyper kind and considerate person and over the top touchy-feely. Gibson immediately begins to stir up the pleasant Ferrell and Wahlberg dynamic and things deteriorate as you would imagine during the full-family holiday at a rented cabin. Enjoy or cringe at the jokes and silly scenarios. Helps if you are a parents I would think. This seems to be trying to be a modern version of Christmas Vacation and doesn't meet that level.

A fine watch, nothing more or less.The plot doesn't have nearly as many laughs as it needs, with that said there are a couple of decent bits - and some weird parts, particularly one at the end. Talking of the end, it's very cringe. Mark Wahlberg (Dusty) is probably the best onscreen, Will Ferrell (Brad) does well enough too.Mel Gibson (Kurt) and John Lithgow (Don) are two newcomers. Both have one or two moments, though nothing more - I liked Lithgow the most. I kinda, somewhat randomly, felt Kurt Russell would've made a much better Kurt - didn't even clock the name clash before having that thought either, funnily enough.

36,TheFearmakers,Surprisingly Not Too Bad,7,10 November 2017,"Ironic that the Godfather of Once Popular Actors Shunned From Hollywood Literally Overnight, Mel Gibson, peaks his head out this weekend following several male showbiz careers being either wrecked or shamed (Kevin Spacey for starters)...Also ironic is that his old school blunt tough guy character needed to be much more politically-incorrect in order to ruffle feathers i.e. intentionally screw up the Christmas spirit, which could have wielded more gusto from Mel, and laughs from us: He's a womanizing former astronaut butting heads with estranged son Mark Wahlberg, while super-friendly Will Ferrell cozily bonds with his even more ridiculously saccharine father in John Lithgow...What begins as a one-up imitation of the original (first two dads and now two granddads) gets a needed push when DADDY'S HOME 2 becomes an all-out snowy vacation flick... As in Christmas VACATION... Particularly a scene where the most reluctant member has to chop down a real tree for the living room. Unfortunately, a lot of the physical gags are either too familiar or simply feel contrived. Worse yet, in Will Ferrell's case, it takes away from his ""oblivious nice guy"" character that still kinda works — anyone can be substituted with a stunt double to fall off a roof, etc...What's good is that DH2 is corny and knows it, chewing away rabidly at the ""this was supposed to be fun and it isn't"" routine (along with old tunes like England's superior ""We Are The World"" rival ""Feed The World"") until it slightly resembles something of its own. Meanwhile, the kids help more than hinder the overall mood and pace: Very needed since Gibson's gruff sarcasm towards Ferrell and Lithgow comes across more contemptuous than funny, especially since the latter plays a talkative boob who's way too kindhearted and friendly: The awkward moments that the film builds on purpose aren't nearly as uncomfortable as the curt reactions that follow each. And until the end, Wahlberg gets lost in the mix but... Somehow it works... Go figure...

37,rgkarim,"Daddy's home for more family, sort of friendly, laughs",7,10 November 2017,"Dad's, the other half of the parental equation and perhaps one of the most dynamic job roles in the human repertoire. This responsibility is astounding for this job, each approached in a different way based on the personality of the dad. And just like the moms, Hollywood felt it was necessary to make a movie portraying this job, in an often-comical manner, to help portray the struggle and hopefully teach a lesson. Robbie K back in the movie theater trenches to review another hit feature entitled Daddy's Home 2 starring Will Ferrell and Mark Wahlberg. Will the dynamic duo get the magic right, or is this a series that needs a divorce? Read on to find out. LIKES:Fun: If you remember the first movie, you know that Daddy's Home is a very fun, cute film for a majority of the family. That same atmosphere comes off in this sequel, bringing the youthful adventure of the first film, but with a holiday twist and a grandparent theme done right. Our directing team did a nice job of integrating all these new components into a fast-moving tale that provides simplistic laughs, hard hitting banter, and a few heartwarming moments that just make you feel good, or at least accomplished that you aren't incompetent like these dads. The Story: Yes, surprisingly Daddy's Home 2 has a story, albeit a simplistic one that focuses on emphasizing many things not to do with your kids, and sneaking in a few life lessons along the way. The tale continues from where we left off with our two dads becoming friends and trying to live life peacefully. But like the trailers portray, their dads arrive for the holidays and bring a whole new set of challenges. During the journey of surviving the holidays, Dusty and Brad begin to unravel more of their backstory and fears, all while facing the challenges of parenting young kids. As these challenges start to taper off though, the important family themed lessons begin to get doled out, to hopefully establish respect at the difficulties of fatherhood and family. Cheesy and run of the mill, yes. Enjoyable though, absolutely. Integration of Characters: With their extended cast comes challenges of balance, and Daddy's Home 2 did a nice job integrating all their characters into the mix. Unlike the mother version of this movie (Bad Mom's Christmas), Daddy's Home 2 manages to give all the characters stories that interlink, pushing each person to develop themselves on some, often messed up, level. Sure, the wives needed some more screen time and development, but even these diluted tales fit well into the movie and keep pace with the comedic energy of the movie. The Grandfathers are even more impressively pushed into the tale, not only providing launch points for the comedic one-liners, but also helping with Dusty and Brad's own progression. And the kids as well fit perfectly into the mix, bringing with them issues, comedic jabs, and a cuteness factor to keep things interesting. DISLIKES:Stupid Comedy: Yes, Comedy is often a genre loaded with stupidity, but the presentation is what's important (see Thor Ragnarok for good presentation). Daddy's Home 2 traversed the path of over the top, ridiculous slapstick that is so stupid and unbelievable at points. While movies can suspend reality, these stunts were a little too far-fetched for me. Even worse, is that the stunts and comedic devices were super repetitive, lacking any clever twists or delivery to warrant bragging about. And while the simple comedy can be fun at times, it's sad to see such gestures over used when other movies have learned the art of comedy. Impressionable habits: Daddy's Home 2 has plenty of annoying character quarks to make you grind your teeth to the nerves. Unfortunately, many of these annoyances come in the form of the bratty kids and the cruel, selfish tactics that they flaunt so well. While older audience members will hopefully know right from wrong, younger audience members may find these antics repeatable to the point of making them habits. And much like the comedy, these habits are over exaggerated, a little extreme, and eye rolling by the second or third portrayal. The movie does a poor job of showing punishment for these habits, and does a poor job of showing the right approach to dealing with these flaws. Guess it is a Will Ferrell movie, though right?Trailers spoiled: We know trailers ruin surprises, but Daddy's Home 2 has given away a majority of the laughs for this movie. While the plot is relatively safe, much of the comedy can be seen, for free mind you, in the four or five circulating trailers. The resultare stale scenes that have already run the course before the film even starts. Fortunately, Mel Gibson's got some comedic gold hidden in the unaired sequences and the kids have a few zingers, but not enough to warrant this movie fresh if you watch television or YouTube enough. The VERDICT:Daddy's Home 2 doesn't deviate far from the formula that made the first one a success. Simplistic laughs, a nice family friendly story is all wrapped in the 90-minute run time to satisfy your movie craving. It's biggest strengths again are the fun atmosphere and well-balanced screen time of the cast. Unfortunately, these strengths are offset by ridiculous slapstick, impressionable annoyances, and stale comedy spoiled by the trailers. Certainly, this movie is a good holiday laugh fest, but this reviewer does not recommend a theater visit in his honest opinion, not with Thor 3 being much better in comedy. My Scores are:Comedy: 7.0 Movie Overall: 5.0",Daddy's Home 2
38,burlesonjesse5,VIEWS ON FILM review of Daddy's Home 2,4,13 November 2017,"Daddy's Home 2 is my latest review. It's a follow-up to 2015's surprise hit, Daddy's Home. The first outing wasn't great to begin with. Guess what, ""2"" is even worse.Remember when Chevy Chase got into all kinds of shenanigans during National Lampoon's Christmas Vacation? Well Will Ferrell does the same exact shtick in Daddy's Home 2. Ferrell's gifts as a physical comedian are evident. The difference is that Chase's movie was done with a bit more craft. Heck, it had an actual story mind you.""2"", with its clips of kids getting drunk on eggnog, a nativity scene being destroyed, Xmas lights getting caught in a snowblower, and captain ""Sully"" Sullenger making a small cameo, is a yuletide cash grab just like A Bad Moms Christmas (released ten days earlier). The films are eerily similar with Daddy's Home 2 being the gender-flipped version of ""Christmas"". With A Bad Moms Christmas, the males are reduced to forgotten caricatures as they harbor minimal dialogue and fade into the background. With ""2"", the females don't have much to do either in terms of the overall plot. They are merely around for decoration (ha-ha, get it?).Listen, ""2"" may be PG-13 (as opposed to A Bad Moms Christmas having a hard R) and it may be more slapstick in nature. Don't be fooled though. These flicks are mirror images of each other. They are both using the holidays as a hook to capitalize on the success of the originals. Yup, Daddy's Home 2 isn't a ""home"" worth saving. ""2's"" director (Sean Anders) sans production values and trouper, conflict coherency in favor of sloppy editing, too many characters (stepdads, stepmoms, grandpas, stepchildren, etc.), and perennial, movie star wattage. His ""2"" isn't an actual motion picture. It's more of a series of set-ups, designed to get the viewer to chuckle occasionally. Almost every scene in Daddy's Home 2 is manipulated (or inserted) onto the screen without a true reason for being. Oh and by the way, Ferrell's pseudo-clumsiness here is definitely not rooted in reality. In the realm of casting, Anders brings in John Lithgow and Mel Gibson to play the weirdo dads to Mark Wahlberg and Ferrell. Gibson, who has always been a favorite of mine, has obviously not been forgiven by Hollywood yet. In his heyday, he would've never agreed to star in something as shambolic as Daddy's Home 2. All in all, the final sequence in ""2"" involves everyone snowed in at a movie theater on Xmas day. As the whole cast belts out ""Do They Know It's Christmas?"", I realized that I need to picket the resurrection of every sequel from hear on out. Rating: 1 and a half stars.",Daddy's Home 2
39,Zbigniew_Krycsiwiki,It's better than Bad Mom's Christmas.,5,30 November 2017,"Mel Gibson is the sole saving grace to this one, even though his character is a sociopath. Here is yet another movie about an extended family, portrayed by an ensemble cast, reuniting for the holidays,  and personalities clash, hilarity .... um, ... ensues ... ? and everything works out because * PLOT * , and we can't forget the face palm-inducing song and dance routine at the end. Fifteen minutes of this dysfunctional, ensemble family going to a cinema, and "" Do They Know It's Christmas? "", to the accompaniment of choreographed dance routines. Gibson's character seems to be in on the joke here, almost like he's aware of the fact that he's watching Will Ferrell acting like an idiot in a dim witted movie, and Gibson just stands back and says things like, "" What an idiot "" , as Ferrell demolishes a Christmas lights display with a snow blower, or chainsaws a high tension power line, in two of the lamest, longest scenes. Nothing in this film goes anywhere. None of what happens seems to genuinely happen, it seems like it only happens because that is what the formulaic plot needs to have happen, although, as sociopathic as Gibson's character is, he is the only one who made me laugh at all here. Without his character, I would have loathed this one, whereas now, I'm just indifferent toward it. Even Mark Wahlberg, who I'm a fan of, didn't get many laughs from me this time.",Daddy's Home 2
40,bkrauser-81-311064,We've Been Naughty This Year: Here's the Proof,3,12 November 2017,"For those still looking forward to Christmas, know that this week's forced Holiday pabulum, Daddy's Home 2 is proof that we've all been naughty this year and you should probably batten down the hatches before Santa Claus comes to your home and s**ts underneath your tree. This movie is a horrid, rage-inducing, ill-conceived exercise in dead-horse beating that's so on-its-face repulsive, that its obligatory last act koombaya resembles an upside-down diaper that's been left on someone's windshield.Daddy's Home 2 takes the broadly-drawn animosities of the first film and gives them a wider birth as Markie Mark and Wimpy Willy are visited by their like-minded fathers played by Mel Gibson and John Lithgow for Christmas. Looking for a way to get underneath everyone's skin, just because, Mel Gibson AirB&B's a rustic snow-swept cabin and eggs everyone into a blended family blowout. As you would expect the movie then devolves into clichéd comedic hijinks not funny since the Reagan Era to relay a message (I guess) not relevant since Archie Bunker was still on TV.On its face, this movie has every glaring, stupid, simpering problem the first one did. Will Ferrell and Mark Wahlberg are still cardboard jumbles of male insecurity and chauvinism stuck in an ever-escalating game of one-upsmanship. The kids are still lingering afterthoughts who chime in only when the plot needs a shift in tone. The story itself still plays out like a tour of loosely connected contrivances laboring to maintain a PG-13 rating and Linda Cardellini still plays a feckless, inconsequential support figure. Admittedly, Cardellini does have a tiny bit more to do here but that comes at the expense of having her play opposite the wooden Alessandra Ambrosio – ouch.What makes this movie so much worse however is the inclusion of Mel Gibson's character which somehow takes the tired affectations of Wahlberg's Dusty and strips them of everything resembling an adult. The actor may be pushing sixty-two but Gibson's toxic grandpa (or padre as he insists on calling himself) is a terror on the level of The Problem Child (1990). Never has there been a more irredeemably terrible character worthy of being pushed out onto an ice flow. Yet, the movie somehow thinks Dusty and Brad (Ferrell) are the ones that need to be emasculated, electrocuted and pelted with snowballs. Gibson does get shot once - so that's nice.The film's big climax takes place in a movie theater. An interesting choice since it only serves to highlight the woeful fact that if you've gotten this far without walking out, you're definitely won't get your money back. The movie then ends in a syrupy sweet crescendo of sing-songy holiday cheer so forced it should be arrested for assault. The Song ""Do They Know It's Christmas"" was never played on heavy rotation at my house during the holidays, but after watching this monstrosity, I wanted to buy the record just so I have something physical to destroy. Maybe if I'm good all next year, I can treat myself to skeet shooting the Blu-ray of this derelict piece of bat droppings instead. Yes, I'll probably ask Santa for that.",Daddy's Home 2

44,rockman182,Daddys Home 2 (2017),6,11 November 2017,"I loved the Will Ferrell and Mark Wahlberg pairing in The Other Guys. It was honestly one of the funniest comedies of this past decade. The actors have good chemistry and can play off each other well. I didn't love the first Daddy's Home, but the film had enough decent comedic moments to keep me interested in a sequel, especially with the addition of MAD Mel Gibson and John Lithgow. Overall, its what you'd expect from the film, not overly memorable and gets lost along the way but it offers comedic moments and a good time.It's holiday season and both Brad and Dusty are co-parenting their kids and seem to have found a common ground. Enter Both their dads (played by Gibson and Lithgow). This sudden shakeup provides to be a test for them and their families as they explore problems and try to find ways to have an awesome Christmas despite all the trials and shenanigans that now present themselves. Mel Gibson is not in many films these days so this was a pretty rare appearance for him. Also, we have more John Cena.I feel like the jokes are at times predictable, however some of them are able to land. Its a film that didn't need a sequel especially a predominantly holiday themed film. Lithgow and Gibson and more Cena is nice, but you can't help but feel they needed better material and are wasted a bit in the film. The film can't help but feel formulaic at a time where a creative approach to a holiday comedy would have worked better. Its more or less on the level of the recent A Bad Mom's Christmas.The film gets distracted with its Christmas theme and holiday shenanigans that at times it is at the expense of comedy. I think the film had the cast and makings of a better comedy but a bit of the potential is wasted. Don't get me wrong, its funny it just could have been much more with the talent at its disposal. Still overall, it makes for a decent viewing experience during this time of year.6/10",Daddy's Home 2

46,Anurag-Shetty,Not non-stop hilarious like its predecessor.,8,8 December 2017,"Daddy's Home 2 continues with the story of Brad(Will Ferrell), Dusty(Mark Wahlberg), Sara(Linda Cardellini), Dylan(Owen Vaccaro) & Megan(Scarlett Estevez), after the events of Daddy's Home(2015). Brad & Dusty have become successful co-dads. During Christmas break, Dusty's dad Kurt(Mel Gibson) & Brad's dad Don(John Lithgow), visit the family. This complicates things. Daddy's Home 2 is an awesome film. Director Sean Anders has retained all the elements that made the 2015 original, such a laugh riot. The viewer is laughing heartily for most of the movie. However, the plot is very generic & just like any other holiday themed comedy. In fact, the story of this film is very similar to the recently released, A Bad Moms Christmas(2017). The absence of hilarious supporting characters like, Leo Holt(played by Thomas Haden Church in Daddy's Home[2015]), Dr. Francisco(played by Bobby Cannavale in Daddy's Home[2015]) & Griff(played by Hannibal Buress in Daddy's Home[2015]), considerably brings down the humor in this sequel. The performances are the highlight of the movie. Will Ferrell is spectacular as Brad. Mark Wahlberg is fantastic as Dusty. Ferrell & Wahlberg's on screen interactions, are an absolute delight to watch. Mel Gibson is superb as Kurt. John Lithgow is brilliant as Don. Linda Cardellini is excellent as Sara. Alessandra Ambrosio is impressive as Karen. Owen Vaccaro, Scarlett Estevez & Didi Costine are adorable as Dylan, Megan & Adrianna, respectively. John Cena is hysterical as Roger. Daddy's Home 2 is a must watch for fans of Daddy's Home(2015). Just lower your expectations a bit.",Daddy's Home 2
47,Ruskington,One of the all-time worst final acts,2,21 June 2020,"The original movie, while far from perfect, had it's moments and was reasonably funny. This totally unwarranted sequel however, has virtually nothing going for it. The alpha-beta dynamic between Ferrell and Wahlberg that works well in the first movie is completely drowned out by the respective fathers, leaving the film with no real identity or purpose. Instead it just slips into a lazy predictable rehash of the original. Mel Gibson deserves to be singled out for criticism after a truly atrocious performance reminiscent of Robert De Niro's Dirty Grandpa fiasco. I'm not sure what compels so many esteemed actors to take such bad roles towards the end of their careers.The final act of this movie must go down as one of the worst I have ever seen. The amount of thinly-veiled preaching and moralising is just ridiculously misplaced and unnecessary. John Cena's cameo is pathetic and Wahlberg looks like he just wants to retire from acting altogether. Honestly this may well be the longest half hour or so of my film-watching life.",Daddy's Home 2

Overall, it's a nice Christmas movie.",Daddy's Home 2
49,bob-the-movie-man,Some good comedy moments drowned in schmaltz.,6,22 December 2017,"Comedy and tragedy have always gone together hand-in-hand. Every great comedy tends to have its bitter-sweet moments: Roberts Blossom as the ""shovel-killer"" grandad in ""Home Alone"" (who always reminds me of my late Dad... in appearance I might add, not that he was a shovel killer!); John Candy's depressed shower-ring salesman in ""Planes Trains and Automobiles""; Ron Burgundy bawling in a phone box in ""Anchorman"". The balance between the two is the key thing and comedies can sometimes get it wrong (the Bird Woman in ""Home Alone 2"" for example!).Here is another case in point: ""Daddy's Home 2"", which has some laugh-out-loud comedy moments, but is generally so utterly drenched in schmaltz and sentimentality that the film becomes far harder work than it should be. (By the way, I never saw ""Daddy's Home"" (but read the IMDB synopsys): it was not a prerequisite for seeing this movie).Will Ferrell (""Get Hard"", ""Anchorman"") reprises his role as the somewhat incompetent Brad, 'sharing' his family of kids and stepkids with the much more streetwise Dusty (Mark Wahlberg, ""Patriot's Day""). After a poignant school recital, the pair realise the damage that a distributed Christmas is doing to their offspring and they determine to spend Christmas all together this year. In the process they vow to try to put aside their attempts at one-upmanship - ""the harbour is closed"" - in the interests of giving everyone the best Christmas ever.But their plans are turned upside down when their fathers also turn up for Christmas: Mel Gibson (in a sublime piece of casting) plays Dusty's dad, astronaut-hero Kurt, who is even more macho and extreme than Dusty, and John Lithgow (""Miss Sloane""; ""The Accountant"") plays Brad's airy-fairy father Don... the apple has not fallen far from the tree there. Kurt forces the family to 'fight' Christmas on a neutral turf by renting a palatial AirBnB in a snowy wilderness. Tensions rise between the diverse individuals until a breaking point is inevitably reached.There are some great farcical sight-gags in this movie. Quite a few of the funniest ones are spoiled by the trailer, but there are still a few standout routines that made me guffaw. A hi-tech shower is predictable but funny; and Brad's use of a snowblower to apocalyptic ends is the funniest scene in the movie. Wahlberg and Ferrell are a trustworthy double act (after their initial surprise pairing in ""The Other Guys""). Gibson and Lithgow also inhabit their roles perfectly, although it was hard of me to relate to either of them. The scene on the airport escalator as they arrive is very well done.The supporting cast all play their parts well: ER's Linda Cardellini as Brad's wife and Dusty's ex-wife; Brazilian model and actress Alessandra Ambrosio, as Dusty's (almost unbelievably good-looking) new wife Karen; and WWE star John Cena as Karen's ex-husband. (Doesn't ANYONE stay married in the US any more?). The kid stars - Didi Costine, Scarlett Estevez and Owen Vaccaro - are also good, with Estevez being particularly appealing. Watch out for a funny cameo in the final scene as well, which I found very amusing (""You only have one story"" ... LoL).What drowns out the comedy though is the sentimental storyline around a personal tragedy being lived out by one of the family. The angst and nasty back-biting that surrounds this I found neither funny nor pleasant. The story builds to a snow-bound cinema (showing ""Missile Tow"" starring Liam Neeson... a great ""pointless answer"" for the BBC's ""Pointless"" quiz!) and a finale song that is just so over the top that it has both an ""awww"" factor and is bile-inducing all at the same time. The screenplay is by Sean Anders and John Morris, with Anders also directing. Will Ferrell films can be like a game of Russian Roulette, and I fully expected this to be truly awful. It wasn't, and as a Christmas comedy it is an OK watch... and thankfully significantly above ""Jingle all the Way""!(For the graphical review, please visit bob-the-movie-man.com or One Mann's Movies on Facebook. Thanks).",Daddy's Home 2
50,AngelHonesty,"Too Chaotic, but Still Funny",5,3 January 2021,"I found the movie a little downgraded compared to the first. The jokes were raised to a higher bar taking some of the funny away. There with so many concepts of family involved that it felt a little scattered and overbearing trying to keep up with all of it. I didn't mind the first film, the story was original, and funny with Will Ferrell at his usual jokes and Mark Walberg to bring in the tough guy act. Daddy's Home Part 2 had some funny moments that made me laugh but most of it felt a little over done. I wasn't expecting the Christmas theme since the first film had nothing to do with Christmas. It made the movie a little Cliché. Overall, if you like Will Ferrell and his acting style then you will most likely enjoy the film. If you are not a fan of his normal style of comedy, then you most likely will not enjoy the film.",Daddy's Home 2

They all decide to go on a holiday to resolve the problem of whose house to have Christmas dinner at. The film had moments of humour and I found myself laughing here and there, but I have an IQ of 30 and found it mainly boring. Be aware that most of the best jokes were shown in the trailers (booooo!)

That was the funny part why. Because Mark is the Good looking younger one. WILL is the OLDER OLD GUY. Even all his ex girlfriends still wanted him. All those chicks were pretty hot. But in these films Daddy's Homes Mark was the HOT one with the Very Hot Second Wife in the second One. But in these Films he listened to WILL. But in his other films he kind of bossed him around.

58,trinaboice,Laughter and love,8,11 November 2017,"Grade: BRating: PG-13, 1 hour, 40 minutesIn a Nutshell: ""We're back with more daddies!"" says Will Ferrell's character, easily the tag-line for this movie.It's a funny sequel that also has some touching, cheesy moments, which will put you in the Christmas spirit and inspire you to celebrate your own crazy, dysfunctional family.Uplifting theme: Divorce doesn't end the relationship. My parents were divorced when I was a little girl, but they continually have to associate with each other because of their children. Instead of competing for their kids' love, parents and step-parents should be glad that there are more parents around who can love and support their children. It's never perfect, but it's better than hating each other, which hurts the kids and puts them in a difficult situation. ""You're the only one who can ruin Christmas."" – Brad Whitaker (Will Ferrell) Family comes in all shapes and sizes. Love, patience and forgiveness.Things I liked: The leading men were very entertaining and had great chemistry together. They are all equally talented at comedy as they are in at drama. Wait, have we ever seen Will Ferrell in a serious drama? The cabin where they stayed was awesome! I stayed in an AirBnB home in Arizona that had the same awesome shower. Mark Wahlberg did a great job. There's an interesting article that reveals Wahlberg hopes that God will forgive him for his past mistakes and movies. While Mel Gibson plays Mark Wahlberg's dad, he is only 15 years older. Surprising, right? I thought it was funny when Mel Gibson's character demands that his grandchildren call him ""El Padre."" My dad decided he wanted his grandchildren to call him ""Sir"", so now they call him ""GrampSir."" Ha ha The ""Be a man"" bowling scene was funny and touching at the same time. I have 4 sons, so my husband gave that speech many times to our boys that Mel Gibson's character gave to the cute Dylan (Owen Vaccaro). The band ""Chicago"" is mentioned in a funny way and you also hear their music later from Chicago IX - Chicago's Greatest Hits. I went to one of their concerts back in the day. There's a really cool copper mug that several people hold and drink out of. I looked on Amazon to see if I could find it and I did. It's called Moscow Mule Hammered Copper 18 Ounce Drinking Mug, Set of 4. I thought the movie ""Missile Tow"" sounded awesome! Ha ha It's the pretend movie that the families watch at a theater, featuring Liam Neeson. Linda Cardellin's characters says of the movie, ""It has kids in it. How dirty can it be?"" That was a big poke at the movie Daddy's Home 2 itself. The answer? The presence of kids definitely doesn't mean the movie is clean or appropriate for kids to watch. All of the characters sing! They don't all have great voices, but it's still really fun to see and hear them sing. John Cena has a much bigger role in this movie than he did in the first Daddy's Home. If you're a fan (who isn't?), you'll be happy to know that he voices the main character in the movie FERDINAND that arrives in movie theaters next month. Rumor has it that the next movie in this franchise will revolve around him. The audience I sat with loved the surprise cameo at the end of the movie.Things I didn't like: The trailer showed lines that didn't actually appear in the movie. It definitely helps to have seen the first Daddy's Home movie. You'll understand more jokes and the character development better. There are references to things that happened in the first movie. Some of the jokes fall flat. It often feels like a goofy sit- com with a laugh track and carefully placed music to tell you how to feel.Funny lines: ""I got some gender-neutral flashcards!"" –Brad Whitaker ""The thermostat is a sacred covenant."" – Brad Whitaker (That's so true. When my sisters and I were growing up, we had a constant battle with our dad about the temperature in the house. We would dial the temperature up to the high 70's and he would knock it back down to the 60's. ""It looks as if he's been chiseled out of Gibralter itself."" – Will Ferrell's character describing Mel Gibson's character.Tips for parents: There is a funny scene when Will Ferrell and John Lithgow play car games during a long ride to a cabin in the snow and drive everyone else nuts with their enthusiasm. What car games do you play with your family? Here's a list you can use with your kids to make the time go faster in the car and be more enjoyable. You see Will Ferrell's back side in his underwear with an uncovered cheek. There is a lot of man-on-man kissing (father/son), as well as talk of French kissing, and a gay moment where a boy wants to kiss another boy. Inappropriate sexual innuendos. Megan (adorable Scarlett Estevez) lifts up her shirt to look like her sexy step-mom. Later, she swears several times and shoots a gun. Some sexist comments. Two of the little girls get drunk. Didi Costine's character was such a bratty little girl. She was either on her cell phone the entire time or saying snotty things to people. If you have a daughter, talk to her about some of those behaviors that can make a pretty girl become ugly. Andrea Anders has a very short part as a principal who tries to unsuccessfully convince the parents to put down their cell phones and iPads. I laughed out loud, because it's so true. Mel Gibson's character is a womanizer.MOVIE REVIEW MOM@trinaboice",Daddy's Home 2

The writing was bad, and the ad-libs were worse. Mel Gibson's character spent most of the film trying to cue audience laughter with his own maniacal laugh, but what he was laughing at simply wasn't funny. And I've rarely seen a film much cornier than this one. I actually felt embarrassed for the performers. Let's just shove 'love' down our throats, why don't we. There is one scene that features the idea that shoplifting is cool, another that suggests the boy do what is now being considered sexual assault to a girl he likes, and another that attempts to justify an affair. While I love irreverence in comedies as much as the next guy, such scenes are totally inconsistent with the preachy 'family values' feel of this movie. And can someone explain how Ferrel's character managed to come up with a full wardrobe when his was tossed prior to their trip? A scene at least implying he was going shopping would have been nice. And what was that facial hair Wahlberg was sporting?

64,Mike_Devine,"A ""meh"" addition to your Christmas movie collection",5,28 December 2018,"Will Ferrell has basically built a career around teaming up with others to deliver memorable comedic roles. In 'Daddy's Home,' Ferrell and Mark Wahlberg did their best as dueling dads who tried to establish a whole ""co-fathering"" protocol that is modern with a capital M. In 'Daddy's Home Two,' these two gargantuan actors are joined by two others who are larger than life - Mel Gibson and John Lithgow.As you would expect, there's a lot of more of the same this time around. The same old brand of humor that Ferrell and co are known for, although geared more for a family audience. Gibson's Kurt is the rough around the edges badass dad, while Lithgow's Don is a touchy/feely betamale with a kind heart. Of course, spending Christmas in a log cabin with a bunch of kids from different marriages is a recipe for disaster.Of course, none of the actors bring their A-game here, although it's nice to see Linda Cardellini and Alessandra Ambrosio reprise their roles as the two moms in the clan. John Cena also makes an appearance as one of the girls' father - a role that probably could only be pulled off in an intentionally serious way as someone like Cena.

This sequel to Daddy's Home starring Will Ferrell and Mark Walhberg introduces us to their respective Fathers, John Lithgow (Father to Will) and Mel Gibson (Father to Mark). What ensues is a hilarious series of unfortunate events, misunderstandings and explosions of pent up frustrations, all singularly caused by or egged on by Mel Gibson. Consisting of Fathers, Stepfathers, Mothers, Stepmothers, siblings and Grandfathers, the whole family drives five hours to a beautiful log cabin to spent the holidays together, but as Christmas draws nearer the already dysfunctional families drift further apart. This film didn't have me rolling in the aisles clutching my sides, but there were enough humorous moments to make it a great piece of family entertainment in time for the Christmas season. The script must have been twice as thick as a normal film because the characters did not stop talking from start to finish, and there were cute kids, guaranteed to win you over. I think this instalment was better than the first, but don't take my word for it, go and find out for yourself.",Daddy's Home 2
68,ginocox-206-336968,"Much better than expected, enough laughs to make it worthwhile",7,9 February 2018,"""Daddy's Home 2"" made me laugh quite a few times, which is the first and foremost prerequisite for a comedy. The production values were solid and it avoided two of my pet peeves: relentless reliance on kinetosis-inducing jiggly-cam shots and (usually ultraliberal) political biases interwoven into the plot. Thankfully, Farrell kept his pants on, although a recurring gag will cause any self-respecting homophobe to cringe. But overall, the film was much better than I expected. Will Farrell is not one of my favorite actors or comedians and the film won't make my list of favorite comedies, but it was a pleasant diversion with more laughs than I expected. As with most comedies, some of the humor fell flat and a few were excruciatingly groan-worthy, while other gags were laugh-out-loud funny. The movie is far better than ""A Bad Mom's Christmas."" I enjoyed it more than the ""Ghostbusters"" remake.",Daddy's Home 2
69,mike-c-b,Mel Gibson v Narcissistic script,1,24 November 2019,"I couldn't last more than 15 minutes. I thought the first movie was great, lots of unique angles and events, despite many cliche lines... but for the second one they expanded on cliche and nothing else.Mel Gibson tried to improve the situation in many scenes away from everyone falling into an ""itty bitty privileged victim"" trap (Ferrell and Lithgow's work). Wahlberg plays a middle man. Every other actor generally hates each other for fun and purposefully misunderstands just to get a cliche scene and a paycheck.It's actually a morally bad film for promoting family infighting via the sheer narcissistic writing (""me me me"") and having to get the actors to do these lines with some character... If you laugh, you accept the narcissism as good, if you don't you're basically watching a non-film.",Daddy's Home 2
70,Mcduff3601,Wayyyy funnier than expected and better than the first,8,13 December 2018,I was totally entertained by this movie. It had me laughing through most of it. Don't get me wrong it's nothing you haven't seen before but lately I have been sitting through some pretty boring comedies and this one had me Loling out loud!!11one.There is lots of things wrong with it but I think this one came the closest to reliving National Lampoon's Christmas Vacation...the holiest of Holy movies. This one probably doesn't deserve an 8 but it made me lol out loud so it's getting an 8!!11,Daddy's Home 2
71,kaptenvideo-89875,"Please no! Go home, and sleep, Will Ferrell!",4,3 February 2018,"Now what the hell is this all about, boys? In the last four years, we have received three really crappy and mostly unasked for sequels to hit comedies (co-)starring Will Ferrell.Compared to ""Zoolander 2"" and ""Anchorman 2"", I would say that ""Daddy's Home Two"" is the best of the three. But this is akin to claiming that I prefer getting punched in the stomach - and not face or nuts. You are not gonna be happy anyway, innit?It's hard to point out what went so wrong exactly, considering ""Daddy's 2"" is so similar to 2015's original and all the main cast is back, but the result doesn't just work. At all.It's not funny, it's filled with mawkish, as-mainstream-as-possible family christmas comedy cliches, and the stuff that feels fresh can be counted in seconds, or maybe couple of minutes. Even Ferrell's and co-star Wahlberg's usual schtick - both alone or together - is so tired that barely rises an smile.As some of the other critcs have noted, ""Daddy's Home Two"" is very much like ""A Bad Moms Christmas"" all over again, toothless, charmless, pointless ""entertainment"" which has no justification to exist in the first place. Aside from the producers hoping to make more money, of course.The worst offender here is certainly Mel Gibson who seems to be sleepwalking through the role. There's not even a moment that he a) seems to be enjoying this, b) clicks with others on screen, or c) is able to add something to the overall comedy value. Well, at least he can dind work in mainstream movies again.I don't know, Will, what your agent and manager tell you about your talent and potential, but you won't get far with this quality level, at least not in Kapten Video's blog! Go back and do less comedies if you have to, but do them right!The people around me seemed a bit more positive than I, so maybe ""Daddy's 2"" is meant for mainstream comedy audience who are not tired of Ferrell pulling his usual for the 50th time already.At least it's over relatively quickly, 96 minutes including the end-credits. There is a ""hidden"" end scene with John Lithgow which, while not quite making you go LOL, feels more humorous and alive than the whole movie put together.And another hidden scene with Gibson which is almost worse than his performance during the movie.",Daddy's Home 2
72,WalkdenEntertainment,"Double The Dads, Double The Trouble",6,10 January 2019,"Continuing on 2 years after when we last saw these two crazy dads, Brad (Will Ferrell) and Dusty (Mark Wahlberg) are now finally used to each other's existences and are now the best of friends. They have worked out some perfect patterns in regards to taking care of the kids week by week. Life in general seems perfect for both families until one of the children mention during a school production that they are sad because they have never had a real all together family Christmas under one roof. To makes matters worse, Brad and Dusty must also deal with their own fathers who have chosen to visit them during the holiday season.Considering Daddy's Home, released in 2015, was aimed as a family film, I found the film to be rather pleasant and humorous. The key to the film's humour, needless to say was from all the witty dialogue between both Will Ferrell and Mark Wahlberg characters. As some of us may recall, the two actors also displayed such chemistry back in 2010 when they starred in the cop action/comedy ""The Other Guys"".The 1st film had a major focus on Brad's character (Will Ferrell), and we saw him learning to handle life with Dusty around. The sequel has done a fantastic job at turning the tables by putting the spotlight more so now on Dusty's character (Mark Wahlberg). Dusty in Daddy's Home 2 is dealing with his own personal father issues (played by Mel Gibson) and is also having to deal his new step daughter's dad, Roger (played by John Cena). Needless to say the relationship that is shown between Brad and his own father (played by John Lithgow) doesn't help Dusty's current challenges in life...For a sequel to be better it requires something bigger and I'm happy to say that Daddy's Home 2 does take the movie up that next step from the previous film. By simply introducing us to more humorous characters, this film works once again. I was rather surprised to see how funny both actors Mel Gibson and John Lithgow were together in this film. During many scenes you will find up to five characters all having arguments or discussions and each line (or joke) is delivered with such energy and overall humour, giving the cinema audience a smile, chuckle or a laugher. Once again, Daddy's Home 2 is aimed for families as it's rated PG.Overall this film comes recommend for any fans of the first film. Daddy's Home 2 goes the next level by putting the lead characters in worse position along with more classic actors in the comedy mix. Being a PG film I can also stay this film comes recommended for families who want to watch a fun hearted film about the challenges of a mixed family during Christmas (which I personally can relate too). The film does go into a couple of minor sub plots which never feels resolved, but hey... Christmas is a time for forgiveness right? 🙂6.3/10

73,srdjan_veljkovic,Barely acceptable comedy,5,23 December 2018,"It's starts OK, there are good jokes and fun to be had. But, after a while, it looses steam and by the end is way to cheesy and uninteresting. The ending song of the whole mall is just bad. It's yet another try of repeating the famous scene from ""My Best Friend's Wedding"" - and it's actually not the worst, but, that's simply because most are terrible.Mel Gibson, as the ""new guy"" is not explored very well. He does have his moments, but, in general, didn't work out.Alessandra Ambrozio, even though she has much more screen time, has less effect than in the first movie. She doesn't even work well as ""decoration"", mainly because she's dressed very plainly - which, of course, makes some sense, but, hey, it's a comedy, nobody expects it to make too much sense. So, if you're gonna have a supermodel, let her dress like a supermodel.Others do more-or-less OK, but, do seem to have less fun than first time around. As a viewer, you simply follow in their footsteps.So, it's an acceptable comedy, but, there are (much) better ones, including the first ""Daddy's Home"" movie.",Daddy's Home 2

No; A few funny slapstick scenes and a few funny one liners are not enough to save this movie.I did not choose to play this movie, but watched anyway. Lame background music that almost seems like the movie is going to turn into a musical, but thankfully it doesn't. (I abhor musicals, and would have stopped the movie immediately.) Until near the end where the cast members and bystanders do a poor job singing a song I have never heard. After about 30 seconds listening to the out of tune singing I skipped ahead near the end of the song to catch the reason Dusty's wife Karen was writing in the book. The closing scene after the credits is more lame than the movie.CONTENT ADVISORY: A few mild sexual innuendos, a womanizing grandpa played by Mel Gibson, Ferrell (son) and Lithgow (father) multiple times throughout the movie kiss each other on the mouth as a greeting and show of affection, Wahlberg (son) and Gibson (father) do the same at the end of the movie, some profanity and young children depicted to be consuming alcohol then later appear drunk with the boy using foul language. Inaccurate and reckless use of a firearm to further the ""scary dangerous gun"" agenda. It was a rifle only big enough to be a .22 with sound effects used to make it sound like a large hunting rifle. This agenda shows up in Wahlberg's other movie Instant Family, that I also watched and reviewed.{1=F 2=D- 3=D 4=C- 5=C 6=B- 7=B 8=A- 9=A 10=A+}",Daddy's Home 2
75,patriciogl10,A Christmas classic for me.,8,29 November 2019,"Daddy's Home laid the foundations, Daddy's Home 2 further rose them into a stupendous construction that intelligently added more ingredients carefully thought out. It's almost as if the casting director, writers and filmmakers knew exactly what Daddy's Home needed in order to make a better sequel, even with the perfect amount of elements needed, nothing more, nothing less. Of course these elements which I'm referring to are the always warming and family-friendly holiday setting and the obviously salient, hugely welcomed inclusions of two tremendous actors like Mel Gibson and John Lithgow, two polar opposites as already shown with Mark Wahlberg and Will Ferrell. It is truly impressive how well the casting turned out with them, they played their parts perfectly, you can truly see ""like father, like son"" written all over their characters.So these newcomers throw in their dynamics and bring along an exciting mixture of associations between the four characters. Mel Gibson cleverly
delivers his hilarious swagger and macho attitude that contrastingly clashes with the soft, gentle and sensitive John Lithgow whom also portrays fabulously and pretty accurately a character basicly designed to be Will Ferrell's character, but older. Many hilarious situations take place, from Brad (Ferrell) and Dusty (Wahlberg) receiving their dads, Don (Lithgow) and Kurt (Gibson) at the airport to a terrible mishap with Christmas lights.The teasing of John Cena's character at the end of the first film was well-put in, because it felt there was room to explore his character as well.
It proved to be another astute move on behalf of the casting directors, since his inclusion actually made this movie a lot funnier. A new rivalry emerges with him and Rusty, who wants to be liked by his step-daughter, who hates him and unconditionally loves his daddy, Roger (Cena).
The whole family goes to a cabin, where Brad and Dusty find themselves going at it once again. The manger scene is exhilarating, definitely one of the best in the whole film. Overall, I find it to be very consistent, it can hardly disappoint, unless you're biased by dislike or hatred towards either Mel Gibson or Will Ferrell.The ending puts everything in perspective, as with most holiday movies, this one also leaves a heart-warming and sentimental message about forgiving and family union, along with the classic Christmas carol, this time tenderly singing all together ""Do They Know It's Christmas?"".A Christmas classic in my book, I have seen it many times already.

I really expected to hate it , but it brought out a lot of emotions , a lot of laughter and some tears but also a fair amount of cringing too . It was by no means a perfect movie , my friend who went with me and was the driving force to see this gave it 5/10 so surprisingly I enjoyed it more but it's all about expectations . There were some really funny moments and Will Farrel was actually on top form for most of the movie which was a relief as he's been box office turkey material for about 50% of his his films lately - very hot and miss, but in this he's mostly hit. There were however some cringe worthy moments too . Christmas is a good time to bring out a movie than set at Christmas with comedy , love , family , modern extended families with step dads , step mums ( moms ) and step children and add some weird granddads - you can guess next year it'll be the grans ! Oh no that's Bad Moms ! There were times when it felt a little formulaic and plagiarized of such hits as National Lampoons Christmas vacation .The breaking of the fourth wall was a common theme throughout eg the nativity scene , the opening camera shot in the playground and mostly the final act after the avalanche - I won't go in to detail as I always avoid spoilers . I'm not sure how the budget ran to $70m it could have been made for $10m plus profit share . It was good to see the Ford Flex taking a starring role a love/hate family car with comic undertones emulating a cross between a Range Rover and a National Lampoon vacation embarrassing station wagon . Some of the casting was a bit odd , I haven't seen the first film , but pairing up Mark Wahlbergs character with a supermodel was hard to believe in when he looked like he could be in Star Wars as Chewbacka without the need of any additional make up . Even harder to comprehend was Mel Gibson's character as a sex symbol , he came across quite purvey to be honest and was embarrassing to watch but he seemed typecast as an aging alcoholic past his prime ! John Lithgows character although over the top was more believable if not cringe worthy in some scenes particularly the almost scarily incestuous relationship with son but that's comedy sometimes it pushes boundaries vs a vie the Farley BROS something about Mary The use of the Band Aid classic and the theme of Christmas , love conquers all will make this film have an ephemeral shelf life beyond 2017 meaning it's Cashmas for the producers one of which is Will Farrel so that's his pension sorted !

This time it's time to meet the fathers from each side of the family. The film is exactly like the first one...everybody trying to outdo each other and always proving to the other party how heir way of life sucks etc.John Lithgow plays Don (Brad's Father) and Mel Gibson plays Kurt (Dusty's Father). Lithgow and Mel are very funny in different ways. Lithgow is very in your face and gross kind of funny, where as Gibson is more very dark and menacing and a tough guy kind of funny. As an example taking the his grand kids hunting to not make them ""pussies."" The problem here is that the script doesn't allow Lithgow or Gibson shine as much as they could. It all feels wasted in a way.All in all there are a lot of jokes that work and a lot that fail. Without spoiling too much there is one joke that involves the kids drinking alcohol and getting drunk. If we had similar jokes to that this film would have been comedy of the year, but oh well! It's a Christmas movie and it's always a fine message that it's always about the family gathering!

85,jonerogers,Hilarious romp,9,21 December 2018,"I have seen this film twice at the cinema and twice on dvd and it makes my sides hurt with laughter every time it's so funny. For a Christmas film to be a success you need a family gathering, some of said family to not get on, accidents and laughter and this has all the boxes ticked.The story is set about a family that has a dad and a step dad and granddads of both. They are all brought together for a together Christmas in a neutral lodge and it's then a rip roaring laugh from start to finish where more or less everything goes wrong.The four main characters are Will Ferrel, Mark Wahlberg, John Lithgow and Mel Gibson who all are exceptional at delivering a fantastically funny film.

87,joshbarton15,Easily better than the first,6,19 November 2017,"Daddy's Home was a bit of a damp squib, particularly after Will Ferrell and Mark Wahlberg shared such good chemistry in The Other Guys a few years before. That being said, the door was always left open for a sequel, and with the likes of John Lithgow, Mel Gibson and John Cena joining the cast, I was definitely expecting Daddy's Home 2 to be a better comedy.Brad (Will Ferrell) and Dusty (Mark Wahlberg) have put their differences aside however, their kids are fed up with the fact they spend Christmas between two homes, a result of having a father and stepfather. Problems mount when both their fathers (John Lithgow and Mel Gibson) invite themselves to spend the Christmas holiday with the family.Comedy sequels don't usually outdo their predecessor however, that is most definitely the case with Daddy's Home 2, the main reason being the additions to the cast who make this a much more enjoyable experience. It's by no means a great comedy but it did make me laugh a lot more than the previous film.John Lithgow and Mel Gibson are two most welcome additions to the cast, giving off the complete opposite vibe from one another and the moments they share with their screen sons key to the film being more successful. Thankfully the chemistry between Ferrell and Wahlberg has improved too, Ferrell in particular not being as irritating as before. John Cena, who's shown signs of potential comedy chops before, is unfortunately wasted as the rival to Dusty, which is disappointing as it would have been great to see Wahlberg and Cena go head-to-head properly.Some of the jokes do fail to land, an ill-judged running joke of Gibson's grandfather being obsessed with getting his grandchildren to possess a firearm for hunting being the one that missed the mark by a mile. There were some moments that had me laughing hard though, which always tends to happen when Ferrell is involved however, if you're not a fan of awkward family bonding with awful singing, this may not be the film for you. I quite liked it but it could be a major turn-off for some viewers.All in all, Daddy's Home 2 is a harmless comedy that offers plenty of fun and a dynamic between Ferrell, Wahlberg, Lithgow and Gibson that is really hard to not find amusing. There's also a great cameo towards the end for anyone who's into that sort of thing.",Daddy's Home 2

Im also giving this movie a plus for keeping up with its continuity and doing something with the cliffhanger it left at the end of the last one cause that too was great.

94,margulanabutrlov,Daddy's Home Two REVIEW,9,23 March 2019,"After their earlier feud, stepfather Brad (Will Ferrell) and biological father Dusty (Mark Wahlberg) are now harmonious co-dads. But when they invite their respective fathers, Don (John Lithgow) and Kurt (Mel Gibson), to spend Christmas with the family, old tensions are bound to reignite.
2015's Daddy's Home hardly set the world alight, but it was a perfectly serviceable comedy which traded well on the highly strung whimsy of Will Ferrell (as mild-mannered Brad) and the alpha male charisma of Mark Wahlberg (as non-mannered Dusty). This follow-up, meanwhile, has the whiff of Studio Mandated Sequel about it: an empty shrug of will-this-do improv-gags combined with thoughtless sexual politics, all somehow making it seem more outdated than the original.
As with many an inferior sequel before it, Daddy's Home 2 hopes to up the ante by upping the cast list, adding John Lithgow and Mel Gibson to the ensemble as the respective daddies of the original daddies. Like father, like son, it follows that like original, like sequel, and indeed, most of the same fundamental jokes are repeated here (Ferrell is a softy, Wahlberg isn't), as is the fundamental plot (conflict arises over reductive masculinity tropes).
As 'Paw-Paw' Don, Lithgow is even more of a softy than Brad, the kind of dad unafraid to affectionately kiss his adult son on the lips or hug a problem out. Lithgow's patented brand of ebullient male-in-crisis is always worth a punt, and well-cast against Ferrell; his melancholy at the crumbling of his marriage amounts to the film's few moments of pathos.
Gibson, on the other hand, is even more of a one-dimensional toxic manchild than Wahlberg. His character Kurt is a retired astronaut, though the film seems to view this as a profession for jocks and chauvinists, not physics PhDs and humanists. Whatever your view on the recent Melaissance, comedy is hardly his strong suit anymore - especially not when it involves jokes about dead hookers, non-consensual kissing, or doling out a ""big slap on the caboose"". If it's meant as an uncomfortable ribbing of his scandal-hit past, it feels utterly tone-deaf to the current climate.
This is not the film to make droll, considered comments on shifting sociocultural norms. This is a film which grabs hungrily and flailingly for the low-hanging comedy fruit. Parents love to take photos of their kids! Dads are really sensitive about the thermostat temperature! Will Ferrell often falls over! All these areas are mined joylessly, until there's nothing left in the comedy quarry.
Elsewhere, there's a perfunctory subplot where Linda Cardellini's largely ignored wife is jealous of another largely ignored wife, played by Alessandra Ambrosio. But the film seldom lets us forget that this is primarily a man's story, told by men, about men fumbling their way towards some sort of obvious realisation. And when that personal growth finally arrives, it feels horribly unearned, leveraged by a sprinkling of standard-issue Christmas miracles. Your realisation about Daddy's Home 2, meanwhile, is likely to come a lot sooner than that.",Daddy's Home 2

98,rightisright,Better than the first.,8,12 November 2017,"I laughed, I cried. You really kinda had to have the first one to follow this one right away though. I don't want to spoil the funniest scenes or the moving ones so I'll be short. Will Ferrell is on top of his game, hammy yet funny and real at the same time. The real star of the movie is an old pro working it harder than anyone, and that's John Lithgow. And John Cena has developed his comedy chops very well. And you'll never listen to a certain Christmas song the same way again.",Daddy's Home 2
99,MovieGuyFunTime,The Main Message Isn't Obvious,8,7 April 2021,"I thought this was a really good movie that covers a lot of ground regarding family relations and it does most of it very well and in fresh and clever ways. Walberg and Ferrel make a surprisingly good comedy team and the addition of Lithgow and Gibson in this film as their fathers was a great choice.There are great lessons and messages about acceptance, forgiveness, sacrifice and doing what's right, even if some find it ""politically incorrect.""While there were a few surprisingly powerful moments in the film (turkey hunt, Lithgow's improv), the most poignant scene for me was when the family was portraying a ""living nativity scene"" and they start squabbling over who plays which character. Things come to blows (snow balls) and everyone walks off in different directions... leaving their poor baby (who is playing Jesus in the crib) crying and alone. This is the most powerful (though least obvious) message of the film.For nearly the whole movie, family members are fighting and squabbling and bickering over relatively minor issues. A few unforeseen ""problems"" shake up their plans and they get frustrated and take it out on each other. There is a scene at a school where kids are on stage telling what Christmas means to them (toys, family)... Interesting that in this whole film about getting together on Christmas, there is not one line spoken about Christmas being the celebration of the birth of Christ. And perhaps that is why the scene where the baby Jesus is forgotten in the manger is so powerful. It isn't obvious and it isn't in-your-face. It just happens as an afterthought and lasts about two seconds. But isn't that what Christmas has come to? Jesus is an afterthought ... if he is thought of at all. And maybe that was the intention of the scene and the underlying message of the movie... but in today's anti-Christian Hollywood industry, it would be impossible to make a movie overtly celebrating Christ.This is a better film than I thought it would be and it is better than the original (which was also good). It has a lot of heart and leaves you feeling good and hopeful at the end that our minor issues are really not worth getting in the way of our love for our family (and others). Highly recommended as an annual Christmas movie.",Daddy's Home 2
100,johnny-burgundy,makes you laugh and feel good,7,11 February 2018,"Daddy's Home 2 (2017)
This is an American Christmas comedy film and sequel to Daddy's Home (2015). It stars Will Ferrell, Mark Wahlberg, Linda Cardellini, John Cena, John Lithgow and Mel Gibson. It follows our fathers Brad and Dusty, now co-parenting Dusty's kids, who have to deal with their own fathers, visiting for the holidays. It received unfavorable reviews, but did well at the box office as audiences seemed to enjoy it. This is another case of critics overreacting, instead of judging a film on what it actually is. This wasn't supposed to be an Oscar contender. This is a fun family holiday comedy and it hit most its marks. Sure, it can be cheesy at times and use some cheap gags, but in general it does what it wanted. It makes you laugh and feel good.",Daddy's Home 2
101,bgsmall,Some laughs - not quite living up to the expectation set by the first film,5,22 December 2019,"Saw this on the schedule of my newly purchased Christmas 'TV Times' and thought I should give it a 'run out', having previously watched the first movie.John Lithgow and Mel Gibson add decent (acting) heavy weight foils to their respective sons (Ferrell and Whalberg respectively). However, the story arc repeats the first film: macho vs. sensitive parenting. There are laughs to be had, but not as engaging as the first.",Daddy's Home 2
102,jaywensley2004,Too frenetic to feel,6,9 November 2017,"There's a scene early in ""Daddy's Home 2"" where we watch a car fast-forward to a stop. There's no reason for the footage to be played at an accelerated speed.The scene could serve as a metaphor for the entire movie.There is a great deal to like about ""Daddy's Home 2"": Some truly bend-over laughing comedy, a look at legitimate family dynamics, and some heart-warming (and heart-breaking) moments of relationships being formed, damaged, and mended. But all of it happens too quickly.From the movie's beginning, the frantic pace serves most of the comedy well; but in the film's most important scenes, when both the characters and the audience need a moment to consider what they/we are involved in...ZZZIIIPPPP, the pace just keeps on racing.""Daddy's Home 2"" is a good movie; a solid kick-off to the holiday season. I want to like it more, but I can't find my way to rate it higher than a 6 on a scale of 10. It could have been better, but the manic pace doesn't reward the impressive acting.Especially good is Linda Cardellini as Sara, the wife/ex-wife of the two main protagonists. She keeps the borderline silliness grounded and provides a necessary character for the audience to identify with; she projects the perfect sense of exasperation, bemusement and affection for the two dolts she loves.Especially unpleasant is Mel Gibson as Kurt Mayron, father of Mark Wahlberg's Dusty. He is so singularly boorish that even when the film tries to redeem him, his character is too far gone to like.There are a couple of scenes that may suggest ""Daddy's Home 2"" is inappropriate for preteens. One, involving the two daughters getting drunk, is mercifully brief but just too wrong for my comfort. The other, involving younger daughter Megan (played by Scarlett Estevez) learning to hunt, is simultaneously chilling and one of those ""bend-over laughing"" scenes I mentioned.As it was finishing, I felt the movie tried too hard to give me a cheerful holiday ending. A bloated production number was unworthy of the goodwill the rest of the movie had earned, although the cast's rendition of ""Do They Know It's Christmas"" is, despite the horrors of auto-tune, a contrivance that works.",Daddy's Home 2
103,RobLuvsTheMountains,"Talented and funny actors diminished by stupid writing, politics and a ""message""",6,17 September 2018,"Here are the POSITIVES: All of the male leads are extremely talented, are at their comedic best in this movie, and have tons of chemistry. The relationships they present are believable and relate-able. The movie does have laugh out loud moments. The NEGATIVES: every female character (except the neighbor girl) is unlikable and un relate-able and it grows old fast. Examples are: Sara is insecure and jealous, Karen is vapid, and Adrianna is insufferable. The biggest negative, which kept me from giving this movie a higher rating, is the grossly overdone stupidities in the writing. Examples: Brad saying he has ""gender neutral"" flash cards to teach about sex. If this is what our society is coming to we might as well throw Science and Biology out the window. The other stupidity is when the characters muse about the 2nd amendment being about hunting so that turkeys won't get overcrowded, sick and starve to death in the freezing cold. 2nd amendment is about self defense and guarantees the right to revolution. The third really stupid thing was the ""message"" at the end. Bottom line: the movie really had a lot of potential considering the immense talents involved. IF writers and directors would just be funny and leave the politics and ""messages"" out of it maybe the public would be able to just enjoy themselves.

109,fletcherc21,"Cheap Gags, but Enjoyable None the Less",6,15 November 2017,"Daddy's Home 2 is very similar to its predecessor. If you liked the first one, you'll probably like the second. There are a ton of cheap gags and Will Ferrell gets in situations that should have left him hospitalized constantly. The introduction of Mel Gibson and John Lithgow as the grandfathers just takes the opposite dads concept to the extreme as they are even farther out versions of the Mark Wahlberg and Will Ferrell characters. Most of the jokes weren't worth more than a chuckle, with the exception of an extremely relatable thermostat bit. The ending was stretching the limits of believably, even for a ridiculous comedy, but all in all it was solid ideal entertainment.Mel Gibson brought the best comedic moments, largely because he character was really playing into the Mel Gibson tough guy persona and it felt more natural than the other characters. Linda Cardellini was able to do more with her character as she was given a couple scenes alongside Alessandra Ambrosio, whose cameo was expanded into a full fledged role. Ambrosio was successfully hidden in her scenes to avoid exposing the fact that she is a model, not an actress. John Cena was also credited as returning in his cameo role as well, but I never saw him, though the other characters acted as though he was there.",Daddy's Home 2

It also has a great cast with the addition of the awesome Shakespearean John Lithgow and ""bad boy"" Mel Gibson. I imagine this movie is the closest thing to an ""Elf"" sequel that we will ever get.

This sequel contains more slapstick humor, but in turn that also means more laughs. It never got me rolling on the floor so to speak, and most of the comedy was provided through actions rather than words, but that doesn't mean I didn't have a good time smiling throughout either.The themes of relationship sabotage and reclamation continue here, with less satisfying results than its predecessor. I do kind of wish that Brad and Dusty weren't too bothered with harboring internal conflicts as that is what the first film was all about, but it did connect to the overall story so I understand its necessity. Character involvement is plenty spread out with highlights from Mel Gibson, though due to a short run time there is a lot of underdevelopment juggling ten characters. The absence of Hannibal Buress was also noted (and hey, where were the dogs?).As far as PG-13 pure comedies go this may near atop the 2017 list, though that's not saying much. Even if the film's quality might not be worth all of your hard-earned dollars, its value is still best served as a theater viewing experience with the family (age not being a factor), especially as we near the holiday seasons.Minor note: There is a short after-credits scene that is not worth your time.

Dusty has by now remarried to Karen (Alessandra Ambrosio), a writer, and he's step­dad to Adrianna, Karen's daughter. Brad and his wife, Sara (Linda Cardellini), along with Dusty and Karen, are gearing up for Christmas when they learn Megan is dissatisfied going to two different houses for two different Christmases. The family's joint solution is to combine the two Christmases into ""one Christmas together  all of us."" Together­ness incorporates an added dimension when both Dusty's father Grandpa Kurt (Mel Gibson) and Brad's dad Don (John Lithgow) join the fray.Mistletoe is a parasitic plant that grows on the limbs of host trees. Birds propagate it by ingesting the berries and then depositing the seeds in their scat on other branches. Old custom had it that when two enemies chanced to meet below some mistletoe, they were required to exchange a kiss of peace. This custom got imported into Christmas, a time of ""peace on earth.""The two fathers Dusty and Brad are ostensibly the best of pals, but they have been challenged to put their friend­ship to the test in the joint Christmas adventure. It is suggested that perhaps they have been harboring hidden resentments. ""Daddy's Home 2"" will expose any harbored animosity, and not just between those two.Proverbs 24:26 states, ""Every man shall kiss his lips that giveth a right answer."" When Dylan begins to show interest in girls, the dads (and grand­dads) determine it is time to give him ""the talk"", but from which ""father."" They all have different views on, say, participating in a humiliating sport one is not good at, making a move on a girl one likes, and firearm safety. Radically different views are presented to the kid to choose from. To the extent he adopts the right answer, he will be met with the audience's eminent approval.This movie is an over-the-top comedy without trying too hard—the material speaks for itself.

All together in a comedy! Now, let me ask you. is this the best they could come up with? Lazy, opportunistic without a single original idea. Is this movie going to make any money? I'm asking because if it does, I should shut up and dedicate myself to gardening or something like that. Clearly, money is the only reason behind this enterprise and I'm giving it a 2 and not a 1 out of respect for the crew and all their hard work.Phew.",Daddy's Home 2
141,TrevorHickman,Just awful,2,2 January 2018,"Probably one of the worst films I've seen in a long time. I'd really advise people to stay away - in fact it was so cringingly bad I've actually been telling as many people as I can to not go and see it.Ok, let's start - it's an attempt to be a Christmas movie, but can't really decide whether it's a 'family' movie or just a gross bad-joke movie.The interaction and dialogue between Ferrell and Wahlberg is sometimes so bad that it seems to be ad-libbed. Like they didn't finish the script and turned to the actors and said 'say something funny now' we've got a couple of minutes to fill.I hadn't seen Mel Gibson was in the cast (I won't watch any of his films normally) and his addition as a misogynistic drunk was just absolutely grating. I actually couldn't understand why he'd personally want to take the role to be honest. No doubt $$$ was the hook, but if you're a misogynistic drunk in real life why would you agree to star as a misogynistic drunk on screen?Some of the scenes are just pointless. Why do they enact the nativity scene immediately having had a major row? there's no sense to it other than to act as a tool to allow Joseph (played by Wahlberg to fight the shepherd). The film seemed to go on for HOURS (I was surprised that it was only 90 odd minutes long). The ending is weak, in fact the whole premise for the film is weak. Even the child actors (who are usually a redeeming feature in films like this) were annoying.Stay away!",Daddy's Home 2

Started off funny and kept me laughing throughout with some pretty unique humour in there too. Had many clichés that it played off well but also some originality.

I am not any of these things, I believe (like every normal person) people should be judged on there personalities not anything else. The criticism this film got for being homophobic is absolutely psychotic. The way the media are carrying on everyone will be too afraid to say or do anything in case they are accused of something. It was over the part where will ferralls dad kisses him for a long time on the lips. Mark W's character and his father find it funny/weird. Well I would too, I think that is funny too because well DUH there father and son and that is way more overly affectionate than normal. It has nothing to do with homophobia! its not like it showed two gay guys kissing and they were laughing about it, that would be homophobic. A few critics hated on the movie because of this and then most critics of course hopped right on the bandwagon. This is one of the few non animated family comedies the last few years that I actually enjoyed and the media totally discredit and smear it for something that was meant as good natured. It makes me very angry. Besides that I found this film to be funny just like the first daddys home movie. And I am not biased. Its not totally brilliant, a few scenes do fall flat but overall very good. the part where will ferrall gives advise about what to do when you like someone is comedy gold,,, the best in the biz,, ha still has me laughing. 9/10 probably an extra number to show support.",Daddy's Home 2

Wonderful casting. Well written and performed script. Its not a Big Lebowski but its not bad considering the type of films that are getting made these days, so I believe its worthy of above 5.

The chemistry is great between Will Ferrell and Marky Mark and this movie is entertaining at most. The bad now. MEL GIBSON, he is there just to get a pay check otherwise he doesn't need to be here. John Lithgow was one of the most annoying characters in this whole film and he just over acted to point where I was thinking ""STOP"". We went to see this in a cinema with no heating and this is a Christmas movie. Imagine how I felt. I was irritated by how cold it was in the screening and then seeing snow on screen made it feel worse. For some reason two UNDERAGE CHILDREN GET DRUNK ON EGGNOG. Where are the parents? They leave a bowl of eggnog sitting there when they know the kids want to try it. Are they stupid? Sara is in constant completion with Megan's step sister to the point where she goes wherever she goes. She steals and she try's being prettier than her. A sub plot is that Will Ferrell's mom gets a divorce with his dad for some reason and it is never touched later.

168,themonsterman-15193,A Yuletide Cheer Free Comedy,3,3 August 2019,"As a fan of many of the actors starring in this film, I was looking forward to a good comedy that I could enjoy. Unfortunately this turned out to not be the case. It is rather sad to see a top notch comedy actor like Farrell reduced to making poor quality films, and while this marks a (VERY slight) improvement from his recent efforts, it's still a mess. Considering that the film is supposed to be set during the holiday season, there is no yul tide feelings present here, which is a major problem. The laughs are sporadic at best and, in some cases, fall completely flat. As a comedy this is a death sentence. The characters and their actions in the film are mostly dull and annoying, with master actors such as Gibson and Lithgow reduced to mugging and hamming it up towards the camera. Tried as I may to find SOMETHING to enjoy about this movie, but for every moment where the usual gags work, there are moments that completely undermine and overshadow those good moments.
So if you want to sit down and enjoy a nice comedy or even a good holiday movie, your better off watching Farrell's ELF rather than this mess.",Daddy's Home 2

Although, I absolutely love Mark Wahlberg and Will Ferrell, I do feel that Mel Gibson and John Lithgow stole the show! There are characters in this movie that everyone can identify with and that is what makes a holiday movie a classic. I mean, who would have ever thought ""Christmas Vacation"" would become the classic it has become? Both films share the faults of adults whether they are parents or grandparents, and these are human faults that we all share. Plus, they are hilarious!! Highly encourage more original movies like this one especially with all the terrific actors, even if it is a sequel, who cares?

179,TheApplez,It's alright,6,17 November 2018,"In this review I will be making constant comparisons between this one and the first Daddy's Home because the first one was a very very average movie.Let's start with the comedy. The Comedy in this one was decent, a couple of hoots here and there but nothing too special. The Comedy in the first one was definitly better than the comedy in Daddy's Home 2, but that doesn't mean I didn't like it here, it was still good.Now throw all of the Comedy to the side and talk about the movie if it wasn't a comedy in the first place. This one I can say was better than the first one. The plot development in this one was really well done. It was a good plot that we can all understand. And I love that all of these characters in some way were dynamic. They did a fantastic job in making sure that almost all of the characters goes through a important change and being as dynamic as possible, which is something that I really like in movies, another title of this being the Penguins of Madagascar Movie about 4-5 years ago that I liked alot.Now lets talk about what I didn't like about this movie. There are SOOO many sub plots with Brad's daughter Megan trying to act like Adriana, which can get cringy. Also Dylan having a crush on a girl and his father's arguing to give him advice. By the way, the twist at the end where Dylan kissed his stepsister, very cringy, but funny and a unexpected twist. Also the parental struggles with Dusty and his father, kinda confusing sometimes with a lot of issues going on, which is my main complaint about this movie, a lot of different problems that could've been sized down to about 2 or even 1 to say the least.Now, lets rate this movie, I'm going to give this a 6/10. If you enjoyed the first daddy's home, you'll like this one. The Comedy is weaker but it's a better movie than the first one.Thanks for reading!",Daddy's Home 2

Add in John Lithgow and Mel Gibson as their respective dad's, throw them into a chalet at Christmas with the family, and you have a lot of fun!You get some slapstick, shmaltzy, and he-man humour.

205,KeKKi,"My first review since 2006, it should tell you something",9,8 February 2018,"And that is that this is way under appreciated! If you want a fun movie to laugh at and with this IS funny. I'm sure you've spent countless hours on other movies trying to figure them out. You want to relax, have a good time by yourself or with company and laugh?Go ahead - treat yourself!",Daddy's Home 2
206,blueforcemh,I absolutely loved this movie,10,2 October 2019,"I never hold out much hope for the 2nd movies but this one outdoes itself.I can't remember the last time I watched a movie and felt happy throughout. I was smirking the whole time I was watching it, in between laughing out loud.
The cast is great, and the movie is fun and so funny.
Fantastic!",Daddy's Home 2
207,pinkmnky,Great movie,8,22 November 2019,This is a great movie. All the actors in the movie seemed to really mesh well with each other and played off of one another. I spent the majority of the movie laughing and waiting to see what would happen next. When I say laughing I mean laughing till I had tears. This is a great holiday movie and can put anyone in a great mood.,Daddy's Home 2
208,carsleyjw,Just Real Good Fun,9,30 November 2018,Both of these movies... they're not the best. They're super clunky and contrived at times... but I seriously want to cry from the good sincere happiness the writing and acting evoke in me at some scenes. And Will and Marky have such great chemistry. They are the perfect co-dads.,Daddy's Home 2
209,karlheinzfilm,do they know it's ripoff time at all?,2,11 November 2017,"I didn't expect anything but was also not prepared to witness one of the worst movies ever. I never watch a comedy in a theatre (ok, there were only 12 people in the audience) and no on e laughed out loud throughout the entire 90 minutes. and at the end it gets even repulsive.",Daddy's Home 2
210,donnayear,Cannot understand low rating,10,20 May 2018,"Totally great family Christmas anytime movie. Sunday afternoon, rainy day. This movie was funny, poignant, current, thought provoking. anyone who didnt like it def has issues.
The cast is amazing. All the great comedians together for 90 mins lol",Daddy's Home 2
211,cristalcbr,I want to see it again!!!,10,12 November 2017,"All these bad reviews are probably from grinches that have a gripe with the actors. THIS MOVIE WAS AWESOME!!!!!! My family and I laughed the entire time. The different personalities of the characters were golden. I can watch this movie again and again. I highly recommend it. Mark, Mel, Will, Lithrow, John they make a great team. It's all fun and laughs and add the wonderful spirit of Christmas. Just go watch it. Don't listen to the haters.",Daddy's Home 2

216,geogiov,Probably the worst movie I've ever seen,1,1 October 2018,"Just believe me when I say do not watch this unless you want to waste your life. Very dumb all around, maybe a 2 but so so bad it's hard to rate anything below 3 but this actually wins the worst movie of the millennium. If you actually liked it you must have psychological problems. I think I should get an award for watching the whole thing. Has to stop many times to take in the stupidity. I like finishing what I start and have watched some seriously stupid movies to the end but this is probably top 3 ever dumbest disturbing waste of time ever. Sad cause there's good actors and they put money in but directing was absolute garbage and so was the script, acting was somewhat worse in this but it had lots to do with the stupidest plot EVER!",Daddy's Home 2
217,shade-kent,"Most of the sub plots were not funny nor were they well thought through. It was a ""walk away from"" movie from my family's perspective",2,5 January 2019,"The planned shock value was overworked by the writers, and fell flat. That is all you need to know.",Daddy's Home 2
218,charlottes-95197,Loved it,10,10 November 2017,I really liked the first one and when I seen they made a second one I knew I had to see it so glad I did not disappointed at all well worth it GO SEE IT.Will Ferrell and Mark Wahlberg act together very well I hope they make a number 3 perfect choice Mel Gibson and John Lithgow great movie with the 4 of them I hope they make John Cena's part bigger and who could play his dad or even the wives who could play there dads lots of laughs in the movie,Daddy's Home 2
219,tailsock,Satisfying Christmas comedy,9,29 January 2019,"Mark Wahberg and Will Ferrell team up in a pretty funny Christmas story with plenty to keep you entertained for an hour 40. There's goofs, gags, awkward coming of age moments, some unfunny Will Ferrell moments, and really good acting in this dysfunctional family story. It's so dysfunctional, in fact that it's probably the closest thing you'll get to Christmas Vacation. Ignore the far-left Hollywood movie critics who crucified this movie and exalted The Ghostbusters remake. Liberal/progressive values are repeatedly carpet bombed in this film and you can't help but laugh (and even agree). The thought that Americans agree with these caricatures is just too much for them to handle....and judging by the box office success of this (and upcoming Daddy's Home 3) it's apparent that Hollywood is completely out of touch with the rest of America. Highly recommend!",Daddy's Home 2
220,markgriffiths-31860,Disappointing yet extremely enjoyable,4,2 September 2018,"I had high expectations for this film as my good friend Chico recommended it to me. I was let down and have since de-friended him. Not only was it a terrible film but I was offended by many of the jokes. In fact, I was disgusted at times. Having said that, I loved the movie. Really enjoyable.",Daddy's Home 2
221,c-75274,Hilarious,8,16 November 2017,"This was a truly hilarious movie. Although it is something that is rare to say, but this sequel was better than the first movie. It was fun and heartwarming with comedic surprises. All the actors did a phenomenal job with their roles. The movie was light-hearted fun, just like you would expect from a good movie of this genre. Once again, I am reminded why comedy movies are the best (in my opinion).",Daddy's Home 2
222,ancacivitu,Daddy's Home 2 - Not the best comedy,4,23 February 2018,"I honestly don't remember seeing Daddy's Home (2015), but I can say that the second one is not the best comedy I've ever seen. The idea is great and the actors had done such a great job revealing the awkward and somehow natural behaviors of 5 fathers along with their problems. However, the movie didn't have as many funny moments as it could have had. The center of the action shows a big dysfunctional family, so don't expect to burst out laughing every 5 minutes. All in all, I can't say it is the worst comedy ever, but if you really want to 
chill and have a good laugh you might want to search for another movie.",Daddy's Home 2
223,charlie_sheila,Bad movie for children to watch,1,11 November 2017,"We had some hope this movie would be OK, but alas, it was raunchy, vulgar, and even lewd. I saw very young children coming in to watch this movie, being the 2nd one, I thought they probably knew what they were bringing these little ones to see. It hurt my heart to see the low and base behavior that was made to be funny.Now, if the children repeat these things, will the parents laugh? How about what the young boy did after kissing the young girl? Do it in school and you will be tossed into a law suit.Weird behavior between father and son, not to mention odd language. Mel Gibson acted drunk, not that he was suppose to be. Always laughing and showing bad adult behavior.This definitely was not a movie for children under the age of 12 or 14. There were really young ones there at 5-6 years old and it hurt my heart to know these children were exposed to this type of behavior and their parents approving of it by taking them to it.",Daddy's Home 2
224,vickiedowdy,A short letter to Hollywood,4,13 November 2017,"I love Will Ferrell and Mark Wahlburg and will laugh at just about anything in a comedy that they do, I really loved Daddy's Home one and spent hard earned money to see #2 in the theater instead of waiting to see it for free in a few months on TV, but for the love of all this is holy, please leave politics out of film. I almost walked out after paying big $$. The parts that bother me were:**Men repeatedly kissing each other on the lips, the first five times i got it **All conservative characters were gun toting load mouths that were unkind All the progressives were sensitive educated thoughtful and kind (in red shirts)** A line of little girls waiting to kiss a boy character - thats OK, but a little boy in the same line waiting to kiss the little boy - not OK - gay children in movies - please stop!The only reason I have 4 stars is that I did laugh and they poked fun of both sides, but there were lectures galore for the right along the way. I go to the movies to forget my problems, not to get a lecture from the left. Just leave me out of it and stop forcing your ""progressive"" agenda down my throat - please give it a rest!!! You guys in Hollywood better get it soon or you are going to repeatedly lose money.",Daddy's Home 2
225,sunnya-82913,depressing,2,17 November 2017,"I found this movie depressing, the fathers they added in the movie made it so not funny. Mel Gibson's character was horrible. I sat there thinking how is this supposed to be funny. I was hoping that it was going to play off from the end of the first one but no it went a dark direction. Certainly wouldn't go to another one if they happen to make one. I don't want to give away the story line so not mentioning specific parts. But back to Mel's Character and the Christmas part of this movie who thought having a awful father was going to make for good humor?",Daddy's Home 2
226,mikemwaxers,Lame Teen Comedy,1,9 August 2018,"The follow up to Daddy's Home is a disappointment. The writing is poor and the jokes lame and not funny. I think I laughed at one scene in the whole movie and stopped watching half way through. I would equate the writing to the level of teen Disney channel comedies, but actually less funny. Also the attempt to become a Christmas movie in the vein of Christmas Vacation misses the mark by a mile. If you are looking for an inoffensive movie for kids 10 and below this fits the bill. For an adult comedy or even for an adult to sit through it is painful.",Daddy's Home 2

In fairness to him he may have been drunk when he did his review",Daddy's Home 2
228,michelledevereux,Very funny,10,21 November 2017,We laughed all the way through the film. I think this is probably the funniest Christmas movie that has been made in years. All the Christmas movies that have been made lately are full of actors that can't act that you actually cringe for them. Great humoured movie that will become part of my favorite Xmas movie collection.,Daddy's Home 2
229,bmonsoon,Ignore the Haters ;),9,12 November 2017,"100% chance of this movie being silly and ridiculous, so why go if you expect anything else? I was pleasantly surprised because Daddy's Home Two was much better than the first one. I laughed so hard I cried through the whole thing & the rest of the audience was laughing right along. The chemistry between the characters is great, and the one liners are hilarious. I plan to watch this every Christmas.",Daddy's Home 2
230,paulstanbury-66410,This was really good.,9,2 December 2017,"I took my 11 year old son (and I'm 49) to see this movie, and we both thought it was hilarious. I was laughing so hard at times, I embarrassed myself by snorting and I had to wipe tears from my face as I couldn't breathe. I get that all of us are different, and humour is subjective - but I cant help by lose faith in all these academic critics. I don't spend my spare time reading Shakespeare or quantum theory - I'm not looking for subtle life changing messages. This was a great escape from the mundane, and If I could - I would shake the hands of the actors and the production crew. I thought this was really well done.",Daddy's Home 2

The plot just terrible.Stepdad is close to his family, but has no idea they are divorced?? 
Random loner dad is like hue heffner??Anyway just bummed. Can't wait for the next one, maybe the 3 year old gets drunk? Older brother in middle school gets a girl knocked up?? Lol so funny..right.. ? The daughter tries drugs? So many fun situations!!",Daddy's Home 2

I expected a good role from Mel Gibson but he was not a good addition unfortunately. John Cena needs to work more on his acting skills. I think Mark Wahlberg was the only good thing in the movie.

Anyway the most sick scene was with 'gay' kid at the end in the kissing row, what the hell was that?It's wrong on so many levels.Kid can't even know at that age if he's gay or not, it's just promoting gay lobby it's sick and pathetic.",Daddy's Home 2
236,utd-59738,So irritatingly bad,1,5 May 2018,"People who paid any money to watch this film should be compensated. It's one of the laziest pieces of film making around.It's simply a case of everyone involved being like ""First film was a success so we don't really have to try at all and it's still gonna gross high as hell. We've got the faces we need already and are adding another two so we really can't go wrong.""Throw a couple of insanely cliche goings on into an insanely cliche storyline, bung it all together, job done, where's my cheque?

237,w-85355,"""Someone's Got A Girl friend""",10,8 May 2018,"The movie Daddy's Home 2 it was about who was the best dad ever and they wanted to have a fun Christmas vacation so they went or a big house for Christmas. Overall I thought this was a good movie. In the beginning ""Will Ferrell"" went to pick the kids up from school and then came along ""Mark"". Everyone was coming over for Christmas and they all wanted to go on a vacation with each other. Things that were good about the movie was that they all went on vacation and ""Will Ferrell"" almost killed himself Trying to clean the driveway and got the Christmas lights in the snow blower. The only negative thing about the film I thought was that near the end ""Will Ferrell"" dad started acting different and then near the end we found out that his mom died. ""Will Ferrell"" is one of my favorite Characters of all time seeing him in all the good movies he has been in. Mark is also a good character because he's funny and likes to show off a lot. Overall I think this is a good movie and I would recommend it to everyone that wants to watch a movie. If they make a Daddy's Home 3 I would totally go watch it because they keep getting funnier each time.",Daddy's Home 2
