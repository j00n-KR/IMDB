0,Leofwine_draca,A 'one watch'er,5,6 October 2021,"Not bad but a bit unwieldy as a modern thriller. The backdrop is a school shooting, deadly serious of course, but the front story is essentially a DIE HARD clone with a female heroine. The action bits are quite suspenseful and some of the choreography is nice, but the writing is sub-par and the characters bland thoughout; the leads in particular struggle to make themselves appealing in any way. In the end, it's one of those 'one watch' type movies that you forget soon after watching.",Run Hide Fight
1,SnoopyStyle,John McClane in Columbine,6,20 March 2021,"17 year old Zoe Hull (Isabel May) is closing off after the devastating loss of her mother (Radha Mitchell). Neither her father Todd (Thomas Jane) nor her only remaining friend Lewis can get through her defenses.This is a Columbinexploitation film. It's a crass exercise at its core. I didn't watch the trailer so I thought the crassness would be coming from another angle. From her reactions, I thought Zoe was haunted by a rape. Instead, this movie swims in a different swamp, an equally murky one. The filmmaker needs to be careful. He treats this somewhat earnestly but there are still big problems within the story. First, the police don't do what they do here anymore. They jump right in, one by one if necessary. The movie tries to cover it up with a debate about active shooter or hostage incident. The police don't make that distinction nowadays unless it is obviously a hostage situation. With everybody armed today, there would be a dozen parents or regular folks going into the school. There is also no way that a school that size wouldn't at least have an armed security guard. This movie is so Parkland two years ago. It would be more realistic to have a cop cowering outside behind a wall like Parkland. Then there is Zoe giving the shotgun back. That makes little sense. She would definitely give it to a teacher or one of the students so they can continue to clear the school. When a film tries to exploit a sensitive issue, it can't have serious flaws like these.On the plus side, Isabel May is a compelling young actress. Eli Brown is playing up the villain. There is some good 90's tension. It's not the most disrespectful thing around. These are not completely trash characters. They try to give them some levels. The movie is not a joke but one can't take it seriously either. What I'm saying is that this could have gone much worst. The actors do good work and the material isn't trash.",Run Hide Fight
2,nogodnomasters,Unfinished Business,6,25 January 2021,"Seventeen-year-old Zoe Hull (Isabel May) has not let go of her deceased mother (Radha Mitchell ) apparently a cancer victim. Her dad (Thomas Jane) teaches her hunting skills, but she locks everybody out. On Senior Prank Day (I didn't know there was such a thing) a group of bullied and marginalized teens take over the cafeteria and kid some students. They created distraction around town so response is slow. Zoe has conversations with her deceased mother who instructs her to ""run, hide, fight"" as she breaks out of her slump to save her classmates.The film is a decent vigilante film. You get to know and grow with Zoe.Guide: F-word. No sex . Brief blurred nudity (Cindy Vela?)",Run Hide Fight
3,paul_haakonsen,"Ugh, no. Just no...",3,2 August 2021,"I stumbled upon the 2020 movie ""Run Hide Fight"" in 2021, and as I hadn't even heard about it, I didn't know what I was in for here. Yeah, I hadn't even seen a trailer or anything. I saw that Thomas Jane was in the movie, and that was essentially enough to make me want to watch it. Well, that, and also because I hadn't already seen ""Run Hide Fight"" before.And I managed to sit through the movie, sure enough. But I can in all honesty say that this is the first and only time that I will be watching ""Run Hide Fight"". Yeah, this movie from writer and director Kyle Rankin just didn't sit well with me.First of all, no, I am not an American, so I am not accustomed to having school shootings where I live. But I think that a movie with a storyline as told in ""Run Hide Fight"" was a bit tacky and tasteless, especially with the problem of school shootings in the USA.Then there was the issues with the characters in the movie, as most of them were essentially just faceless drones milling about with no sense of personality, depth, motivation and what not. So whether one person died or survived, it was just brushed off with a casual shrug. And I wasn't particularly pleased with the portrayal of the main character Zoe Hull and the way she just heroically took down the school shooting perpetrators without any regards to the safety of herself, her school mates, teachers or staff at the faculty.And the script and storyline felt just a bit too corny and superficial. But then again, I didn't really like a movie about school shootings, so...I am sure that the acting in ""Run Hide Fight"" was adequate, but it sort of drowned out in the swing and miss of the storyline for me, and the movie just trotted on in a monotonous blur for me.This movie failed to entertain me, and actually left me with a somewhat foul taste in my mouth. Normally I am not picky or a prude, or easily offended, but there was just something about this movie that rubbed me the wrong way.I am rating ""Run Hide Fight"" a generous three out of ten stars. And that is mostly because of the production value of the movie and also because Thomas Jane was here.",Run Hide Fight
4,A_Different_Drummer,Delightfully politically incorrect,7,25 January 2021,"Harks back to a time when the word ""liberal"" meant what it said and heralded more experimental movies, more freedom to script.

5,Tweetienator,Rather Boring,4,28 January 2021,"The amount of fake reviews is strong on this one. Run Hide Fight is not a total fail but the plot holes are too big to ignore and the movie does not know if it want to take the matter of school shootings seriously or make something like Die Hard with a young female hero (but for this there is too much talking, a fact that bored me a lot, especially all that talk is just plain boring and cliche). The good performance by Isabel May sadly is not matched by the script/plot and too many (again) cliched characters (especially the bad ones I would call caricatures, for Die Hard okay for a drama not). Also I must conclude that the writers and directors have no clue how much noise gunshots make...",Run Hide Fight
6,jtindahouse,Both a sombre reminding of the world we live in and a bad-ass film at the same time,9,1 August 2021,"When I heard that The Daily Wire had made a film I thought oh no the IMDb rating is going to be 3.5 purely because of trolls down-voting it. The fact that that likely happened and yet the film still sits at 6.5 should tell you just how good this movie is. It uses the 'Die Hard' formula and it works brilliantly.Isabel May in the lead role here blew me away. I had never heard of her before, and thought it was a big ask having an unknown not only asked to carry an entire film, but to be an absolute bad-ass the entire time as well. But she pulled it off. I was also impressed by Eli Brown as the lead shooter. He was convincing and captivating to watch.It says a lot about America (and probably most of the world to be fair) that this film will comfortably show teenagers being shot at point blank range, however a topless woman needs to be panned away from. That's not a comment on the quality of the film at all, just an interesting tid-bit I noticed.This film is not always an easy watch. There are shocking moments that could be quite upsetting for a lot of people. If you're up to the task though I would highly recommend this film. It's pretty powerful stuff. 9/10.",Run Hide Fight
7,generationofswine,An Honest Review,10,16 January 2021,"I WAS PROMISED POLITICS!!!!! WHERE ARE THE POLITICS!!!!!!!Yeah, there was no politics and.... that was AMAZING!!!!!It was actually really refreshing to watch a movie without a heavy handed political message that gets in the way of making the movie entertaining.Yeah, yeah, yeah, I know, it's ""political"" because of who made it....,,, but really, it's just an action movie with a moral to the story and we've seen that a before, over and over, since the birth of fiction.So, what do you have instead of politics?A fun action movie with a strong female lead that can manage to be a strong female lead without making it about politics. You have an active shooter than manages to be an active shooter without making it about politics. And you have a fight for survival that manages to be a fight for survival without making it about politics.And it is so nice seeing a movie that has the courage to be entertaining.",Run Hide Fight

I didn't quite understand why the shooters decided to take the school hostage or what they were trying to accomplish. Isabel May was fine, but I don't see this getting her more leading roles. It was Die Hard in High School, but it was more upsetting seeing kids die, so that put a damper on things.",Run Hide Fight

12,valleyjohn,Welcome to modern America,4,31 January 2021,"I have never heard of the instruction "" Run Hide Fight "" and why would I have ?
I don't live in a country that has always been obsessed with guns and where my children are in danger of being murdered when they go to school , Which is where the instruction ""Run Hide Fight"" comes from and is taught to pupils in America .17-year-old Zoe Hull uses her wits, survival skills, and compassion to fight for her life, and those of her fellow classmates, against a group of live-streaming school shooters.I didn't like this film at all and there are many reasons .
Firstly I'm expected to be on the side of a girl and her father who we see in the first scene of the film , kill a beautiful dear for sport . No thanks .Secondly the pupils who carry out the shootings are ridiculous. We are expected to believe that these bunch of misfits felt hard done by in life and that's why they are holding the kids hostage ,( all of which look about 25 years old) yet we never really know why ? If they were genuine nut jobs as we normally see In these situations they would have just killed everyone.Thirdly the casting is terrible . The Sheriff, played by a seventy year old Treat Williams is ridiculously old for the part and his deputy , who looks like she should be in a Police Academy film , couldn't act her way out of a paper bag.I think the message this movie is trying to portray is about the evils of social media but it's extremely hard to tell.This is a mess of a movie and deserves all the ridicule it gets .",Run Hide Fight

Girl looks like real warrior, and acts good in her role. Realistic environment and characters. But bit holes in the story, I expected bit stronger reaction of police and others. Seems just unrealistic to evade bullets that much, to let girl do so much, and others almost nothing, and especially at the end to make such stupid move, not thinking about possible consequences like imprisonment.

This one was a bit more complicated but I thought he did a great job. Laid out a good plan , it worked itself out without too many contrivances and it got there through the characters and it had some style so I have no idea what else anyone wanted! It was a very nice good effort and it performed, the dialogue was spot on as well!Anyway I want to say congratulations for a well though-out good film and I say great job and everyone should be very proud of themselves because it was highly entertaining and I didn't see too many holes, I only spotted one, why would the antagonist go live on the air before he rounded up all kids first????

16,Horror_Flick_Fanatic,School shooting story with flawed logic,1,9 February 2021,"Major flaw in the writing of the screenplay: Every student inside the cafeteria has a cellphone connected to a social media account streaming the shooters live, yet none of the students in the various other classrooms are aware of the situation. So you have to believe the other students don't have cellphones or they all have theirs off.You also have to believe no one heard the crash of the large van into the cafeteria. The protagonist decides to walk around the school campus knocking on classroom windows to warn others instead of just calling the police and calling other students in the classrooms. Does the girl not know how to text or post messages on social media to warn others?I could pick apart more of this story or the atrocious screenplay but I'll stop here.

17,Rob-O-Cop,Cliche Laden b/c movie with Fake Reviews,2,18 January 2021,"I wouldn't have bothered to write anything as there's nothing worthy to note here.
Everything about this film is average, or below.
Could it have been a good film? Not when its premise was so generic. It really is a school performance of a die hard rip off, and not just because it was set in a school.
None of it rings true, from the ""the voices in my head henchman"",or the ""smart mouth clever evil boss"", and the ""ridiculous backstories to the heroine and the henchmen (I was bulled too you know??)""
It's worse for this script team trying to add shade to these one dimensional creations. It's just movie cliches holding hands, and would have been a forgettable and regrettable B/C grade movie in the 80s too.

19,0w0,"Despite the colossal amount of fake 10/10 votes on here, it's still a fine movie",7,17 January 2021,"This imdb entry for some reason has over 1500+ fake 10/10 votes. Maybe the PR company for this movie bought the votes from a click farm, or what, but it's the worst case of vote tampering I've EVER seen, and I've been on imdb for a while. The fact that this movie is 1.4/10 should be AMPLE proof that this movie isn't really a 7.5/10 rated movie as imdb shows.Anyways.... the movie is OK... there's several things that could have been done to make it a 7.5/10 or 8/10 movie instead of just 6.5/10, but you can see that this movie was done on a very small budget and the actor choices reflect the small budget. Despite all the actors being C-list and B-list actors, the acting in the movie is fine and I've got no real serious complaints about the acting except for some pretty 'meh' acting from some of the children, but I mean, they're children so 'meh' acting is to be expected from them.The ending was so predictable, I saw the 'plot twist' coming 5 miles away. There's also a few plot holes here and there but they are relatively minor and wouldn't really have changed the outcome of the movie all that much.Overall it's an OK movie... it's not 'good' but it just barely does enough to be 'fine'. If you've got literally nothing else to watch and you just want to spend 1hr40mins staring at a screen, then this movie will do just fine. 6.5/10 is my score and unfortunately if you eliminate the over 1500 fake 10/10 votes here on imdb then this movie's imdb score will be WAY lower than the 6.5/10 score that I've given this movie.",Run Hide Fight
20,trinaboice,"Judge a movie by merit, not by the producers' politics",9,21 January 2021,"IN A NUTSHELL:
In an active shooter situation, you have 3 options: Run, Hide, or Fight. This action thriller touches on an extremely sensitive subject: a school shooting. Because this movie is being brought to streaming by the conservative talk show channel THE DAILY WIRE, liberal film critics are trashing it, giving it an incredibly low score of 30% on Rotten Tomatoes; however, the audience score is an impressive 92%! Similar scores from liberal film critics on other sites show the same biased disparity between the ""experts"" and real people. Politics aside, the film packs a punch.If social media buzz sells movie tickets, THE DAILY WIRE is off to a great start. It's their first film to be released by the media company, which includes hosts like Ben Shapiro, Matt Walsh, and Michael Knowles. The film launched on Ben Shapiro's birthday, January 15. When I heard this media company was going to get into the entertainment industry, I assumed their movies would be religious in tone to offer a kinder, gentler version of family-friendly movie entertainment. Wow, was I surprised. This wasn't what I expected at all.TIPS FOR PARENTS:
Profanity and lots of F-bombs
Lots of violence with guns and knives
Lots of bloody deaths
Explosions, fire, and destruction
Lockdown situation at school with dangerous intruders
A woman takes off her shirt but is mostly covered.THEMES:
Courage and cowardice
Sacrifice
Selflessness
The power of social media
Family
Bueurocracy in the American school system
The 2nd Amendment
HopeTHINGS I LIKED:
Isabel May is probably new to most viewers, as she recently made her debut in 2018 on the Netflix sitcom ""Alexa & Katie."" She gives a fierce performance.
In addition to the young lead, there is a cast full of equally talented young actors I'd like to see more from like Eli Brown, Olly Sholotan, and Cyrus Arnold.
Thomas Jane, Treat Williams, and Radha Mitchell are the leading adults in the story.
The casting displays a lot of diversity, just like real high schools in America today.
Almost non-stop action once the protagonist gets to school in the morning. You really feel the tension.
It's extremely intense and keeps you wondering how you would react in similar situations.
If you're a fan of the 2nd Amendment in the US Constitution, you'll be pleased to see that the movie illustrates very well that the problem isn't the gun, but the person behind it.
The movie was written and directed by Kyle Rankin.
The movie's title takes its inspiration from a side story between a mother and daughter. That element of the movie was quite touching. No spoilers here...
It felt pretty realistic.THINGS I DIDN'T LIKE:
It doesn't give you a lot of backstories to explain the motivations of the various villains. They're a bit over-the-top at times.
The police department is portrayed as almost useless.
There are some cringe-worthy acting moments, particularly with the Extras.
Some of the special effects look pretty fake.You can see the rest of my review on my Movie Review Mom YouTube channel!",Run Hide Fight

I could be very wrong, very wrong but I think movie is giving everyone message is Run, Hide, Fight if you were in this
scenario if you were what would you do? exactly run hide, if you have option to fight go and fight. I think it's trying to motivate people to know what to do if your in this scenario I mean look film is unrealistic but it gives you idea to survive I mean I know and I understand movie is realistic but it's trying to give an idea it won't be in same scenario like movie but in real life if you were lucky you weren't caught by shooters you gotta do something that's what movie is trying to tell you I mean look lead actress Isabel Zoe Hull (Isabel May) has uses her wits, survival skills, and compassion to fight for her life not everyone has that but if your only one or with someone you gotta do something at least to survive. I thought this film was well done very done, I lead it's in high schooltype of movie in a Die Hard Scenario with a teenage girt very nice combation and very ballsy film and had a lot of guts to do a film like this I mean it feels like it's real life but I don't live in America if I was it for me movie would feel unrealistic because in many levels if you watch film it gives you an idea to in real life what to do is run, hide, escape or fight if you can that's it but when you look at film it's different when you watch it, it's hard to explain and don't want to spoil it really. storyline Zoe Hull (Isabel May) is a student has a father who is an ex-marine Todd Hull (Thomas Jane) known for Deep Blue Sea, Thursday, Punisher, Hung TV series, is the one who teaches her how to survive uses her wits, survival skills, and compassion to fight for her life to save day from shooters and to villains aren't special aren't rememberable I wish villains would been better but they weren't you got Chris Jelick (Britton Sear), Kip Quade (Cyrus Arnold), Anna Jelick (Catherine Davis), Tristan Voy (Eli Brown) were shooters not much of villains I wish their would be more villains in film more of henchmen make film more bodycount for Zoe Hull to kill shooters but she does but their weren't many I wanted to this to be more of fun action film full on but it wasn't. and other actor who plays sheriff Sheriff Tarsy (Treat Williams) known for Deep Rising is in this film he is their and their not much. why thehell was the rotten tomatoes score so bad, honestly critics just care about the agenda and not about the actual story, because it was written well and acted amazing, trust me you'll love it don't believe Rotten Tomatoes at all they are full crap. Critics won't like it because it provides virtually no political commentary and places all of its value on the importance of courage and doesn't focus on the broader issues at play besides the ubiquitous issue of self-obsession and social media infamy. Conservatives would like it more if they had touched on the issue of nihilism, but again, this movie isn't for the right or the left, it's for everyone. it's fun movie it has fun action and it's thrilling at right at edge of your seat. The way that this movie addresses school shootings, but in a way that can take you through the experience not just by showing you. it's fun movie that makes you think and is well done. Life is full of hard choices. Who should we admire. That is a big theme of this movie. This is worth your time, but not for immature viewers are comparing it as real life well it's giving you an message if you are only one in this scenario to run and hide I don't understand why the haters hate this film for? I bet directors, writers, producers and studio agree to make this movie without giving a F if critics hated this film or liked film but film didn't do well sadly but film was very ballsy director, writer had guts to make this film I like different idea that someone never made movie like this besides Toy Soldiers.",Run Hide Fight

26,stevenrotherforth,How many times can I mention Die Hard?,7,18 August 2021,"Run Hide FightMovie 7/10We've had many a variation of the'Die Hard' formula over the years. Die hard on a boat with Steven Seagal, Die Hard on a train with Seagal again. Die Hard in a football Stadium with Dave Bautista,Die Hard on a Plane with Wesley Snipes, Die Hard in the White House with Gerard Butler. Who can forget the classic Die Hard with a prosthetic leg with Dwayne Johnson in 'Skyscraper'? You get the picture it's a winning formula to say the least. Truthfully it's rarely done well with the odd exception. This latest attempt is somewhat of a fresh idea. Die Hard in a school with our hero or should I
say our heroine being a teenage girl.Isabel May as Zoe absolutely steals the show here as a student who must fight for her life and those of her classmates when a group of live streaming shooters take over her school.Isabel May conveys an inner rage that would make Hugh Jackman's Wolverine proud. She gives a spectacular performance.A movie that at times is uncomfortable to watch giving the subject matter and seeing young innocent people being brutally murdered. Writer/ Director Karl Rankin has crafted a taught well paced thriller that has more in common with Die Hard than some of the aforementioned big budget offerings. It takes the Everyman scenario and turns it on its head. This movie is the formula done right with the limited budget put to good use, each set piece is suspenseful, exciting and believable. There's no jumping across cranes or taking on numerous bad guys without a scratch to show for it. Despite our heroine being a young girl and not some jacked up action hero this film manages to remain grounded.There's a wonderful supporting cast including the always likeable Tom Jane and Treat Williams. There's a thoughtful subplot involving Radha Mitchell as Zoe's mother. The villain played by Eli Brown is convincing even though his introduction seemed like a pale imitation of Heath Ledger's Joker. Given time he settles into his performance and gives a credible turn as a menacing and troubled young man. A particular scene involving his Spanish teacher was rather creepy and unnerving.'Run Hide Fight' works because Rankin has created a bunch of characters that we can care for and a bunch of villains that we can despise. Unlike the terrible 'Die Hard' sequels and most wannabe movies after them this entry into the genre like the original'Die Hard' gets the fundamentals right.Picture quality 6/10Available on Sky Cinema
''Run Hide Fight' is presented in High Definition. Suffering from all the same deficiencies that burden the platform. There's compression and banding issues and the overall image lacks detail and punch. Whilst colours are rendered adequately the presentation will not impress audio visual enthusiasts.Sound quality 6/10Much like the visual quality the audio is below par. A standard Dolby Digital 5.1 mix that does the job but is nothing to write home about. Surround sound effects handle the ambiance but there's nothing dynamic going on behind you. LFE is a mixed bag with explosions having decent weight but gunshots are hit and miss, sometimes having impact other times sounding weak. Objects are steered nicely through the front soundstage but as aforementioned there's nothing exhilarating to get excited about. A 5.1 mix that is reminiscent of one from an early noughties DVD. One area where the mix does shine is with dialogue.Conversation is always delivered clearly even above the action and musical score. There's no hint of sibilance from prepubescent teenage voices. This saving grace isn't enough to impress Home theatre fans but the average sound mix doesn't detract from the movie experience.Final thoughts'Run Hide Fight' is a refreshing take on the genre. Whilst Bruce Willis wastes his time starring in low budget tosh it has taken an unknown Director and a teenage girl to make a proper Die Hard movie.Isabel May is the new John McClane!",Run Hide Fight

30,MogwaiMovieReviews,"Poor Film, Fake Reviews",3,16 January 2021,"I had not heard of this before but it was requested I took a look so I did. Right off I was surprised to find it was produced by The Daily Wire and so quite puzzled as to what the hell I was going to be watching, expecting some very right-wing conservative placard waving. But actually, at least at the start, it went the opposite direction entirely, and threw in more obvious diversity hires than a 2021 BBC period drama, as if desperately trying to prove ""we're not racist or sexist or homophobic (or even fatphobic) like you might think!!!"".Once the action starts it's not quite as bad, and the 'Die Hard In a High School""-type premise could have actually have been great if done well, but it all felt far too calculated and plotted out, like a corporation attempting to design some generic ""Viable Film Product"" with no actual story at the center. No character felt real in the slightest, with everyone but the lead actress spouting only cliches and platitudes throughout, and the bad guys felt designed by someone who'd only ever one other movie before, some random 80s teen movie starring Christian Slater. Okay, and perhaps some clips online of Heath Ledger being The Joker.There was no sense to any of it, so I didn't get what the point was except, after all that, to show that guns-are-good-in-the-hands-of-the-good-guys-that-can-use-them-good, or something. Is that really enough? It didn't seem to have anything else to say or any reason for existing. It didn't actually feel like it was made by anyone who'd ever made (or watched) a movie before.Look, I want an end to 'woke' culture as much as anyone, but the answer to that is just to make good movies which prioritize a genuine passion for cinema, originality and storytelling over diversity quotas and political posturing.

35,anthonyjlangford,Taut. Critics irrelevant,8,10 May 2021,"This is a well produced, taut, tense, carefully directed and scripted film with excellent performances all round. The horrendous drubbing by critics demonstrates once and for all how irrelevant they are in the modern era. They can't keep their bias out of their supposed assessment.I'm not American, so have no interest in Republican vs Democrat etc though anyone can see the gun issue is a problem. You don't have the highest murder rate in the western world and one of the highest in the world in total, without the ease accessibility to weapons that exists. Its mind boggling to the rest of the West.Yet, guns are not a huge part of this film. While the bad guys are laden up, Zoe mostly has to use her smarts to get around the dilemmas. To suggest that she gets by on weapons alone is ridiculous. She's certainly not in the same gun toting arena as Rambo, or The Terminator or the Lethal Weapon films or just about any American cop/crime thriller from any period. Guns aplenty there. She barely uses them.No, the critics hate this film because of who's involved in it's creation. They're completely biased from the outset. Goes to show that society really should ignore critics from now on.It's excellent to see others coming to the fore to create films. Hollywood have really, excuse the pun, lost the plot in recent years with its constant, unrealistic identity lecturing, while demonizing others in the process. Their films are not only unrealistic, they're boring. People have had enough. Hollywood has, in fact, created the environment that brought this film into existence. Expect more. When you shut down conversation. When you demonize people. When you only tell one fraction of the story, people will find a way to be heard. You can cancel all you like. It will only make the kick back stronger and the voices louder.Bring on more independent voices. I hope there's many more films from these guys. It was all class.As a thriller, it was really exciting. Tight direction. Plenty of twists and turns and far better than Elephant, which was a bore fest. Even Die Hard was a cartoonish experience, as fun as it was. This is embedded a lot more in reality. Granted, when it first dawns that it's a group situation, it was hard to swallow. Almost took me out of the film. But the terror experienced by the students seems gritty and real. Not as real as say Polytechnique, but there's real horror in the killings. As it should be.Great to see Barbara Crampton in here. Recognized her but it wasn't until the credits that the connection was made. Always loved her since the grand days of Reanimator. Radha Mitchell really sold her part too. It could have been contrived but through considered direction it really works. Treat Williams does a solid job too.Excellent work all round. Look forward to more films from this crowd and hopefully others soon. Exciting times.",Run Hide Fight

But none of those factors can cover the depressingly lame script, its paper-thin characters and cut-n-paste clichés (if there was an Oscar for stereotypes, this movie would have no contender), its shameless hints both pro and against guns (the something-for-everyone strategy, though I would argue this is a pro-gun & pro-death penalty movie), much less the utterly unbelievable sequence of events that falls nothing short of fantasy: the suspension of disbelief required to take in this story would the same if she carried a magic wand instead of a gun.

43,gk303007,Average,5,22 February 2021,"The only reason I made my mind to watch this stuff was some where in reviews I had read - ""Die Hard ripoff"". However, the ratings were still playing games, yet I thought of giving it a try. And here's is what I think about it.A group of angry kids (or even frustrated and agonizing) highjacked a school, first through some unknown shootings and later shooting those who didn't abide. A girl, courageous and bold, stands tall to stand against the injustice and fights for it, parallelly facing her own inner demons. Frankly, some substance to deal with. Now, what to me wasn't up to the mark, or could have been better:The Police work. Really. I think how the sergeant was frustrated, I was on the same road. In the whole movie, Police were either dealing with some paper work, or rescuing students who were already out of the danger school premise or waiting for their turn. And they like only waited. Oh yaa, at last they came inside to do some work. Ugh.From outside, i didn't notice if the school was that big that if I fire numerous bullets, other than students in the cafeteria, no one else noticed it. I mean, a single gun shot is so loud that it can raise your eye brows. And when they are multiple, there is something serious going on. But no, the classes are going just fine. And everyone else except these students are all fine.The lights went off and then what? No one bothered enough to check what's going on?There were six buckets of explosives, mostly homemade. A single bucket exploded a room but the set of five only erupted only fire, nothing else. Really!!!The girl (protagonist) is also human. She abides by the rules of the antagonist when he calls her on the gunpoint of another student. Good. Then a havoc happens, and she flees the scene. Won't the antagonist create the same scene again? Or she was sure to take risk this time? I can't judge here, but i wasn't very convinced with this direction.A silly one, but i didn't like the scene when the antagonist asks the Spanish teacher to take off her clothes. I mean, any logic of that scene? Or was it just to fill sensualities in an action flick.The main antagonist disguised himself as a student and tries to sneak out of the situation; among all the Policemen, and Students, and Teachers and Public. And guess who recognizes him, the protagonist. Again, the guy was on TV the whole time but no one else recognized him, right?Now, i am not complaining but the theme of shooting inside school premise and then these absurd incidents made me dip the rating. Maybe, if it was some day out picnic, i could have understood those illogical moments.

45,JurijFedorov,Stupid movie yet very fun to watch,7,22 July 2021,"I wanted to write a review because this is one of the most underrated movies looking at reviewers. Most reviewers are very progressive and one thing you'll notice is that they really haaaate pro gun movies. They hate them and they will make it clear. Not that the movie is pro gun in any way. It's not really taking a stand on any moral issue as such. It's just a movie where the heroine uses weapons to solve her problems just like in Die Hard, which it tried to imitate. So yeah, it's getting panned hard. This doesn't mean the movie itself is bad. It's actually lots of fun and will keep you interesting in the good ideas and concepts.The movie is certainly not without flaws. It's clear they tried to make it non-ideological. Which kinda makes the whole terrorist plot feel bare boned and pointless. There is really no point to the movie yet if you love action you will for sure enjoy it. In this aspect it's like John Wick. No clear plot or theme, but lots of passion and fights.Then you have the bad writing. To be fair John Wick is equally terrible in this department and some people like it. Here you just have a director who knows how to direct a clear scene, but doesn't really understand script writing. It's an art and he misses way too much here. Besides the lack of theme and plot he also inserts scenes that make zero sense, but just create some action of save our heroine. In the end we have her dad sneak into the school territory with a rifle and save his daughter with a clear shot. This is so extremely deux ex machina that it's a scene no good script writer would ever accept in a script. It's one of the first thing you learn in script writing and even amateurs like me don't make this error anymore. Not even in a draft. Yet here it is included in the movie itself because when you write and direct you get scripts like this where there is no one to tell you no. Just like with Wonder Woman 1984. Same issue with a writer who directs and doesn't spot the glaring errors. You need to hire good writers for this stuff.The movie doesn't even try to tell us anything. At the end she takes the rifle and shoots the bad guy outside of school. The cops do absolutely nothing all movie long. Which here turns out to be a horrible way to end a movie. We understand she is a superhero. Got that. But when you just let her solve everything alone without any help whatsoever it all feels fake. So you are making the heroine look way worse because you are just letting her solve everything. There is no comparison. We can't compare her to a good and experienced cop or SWAT. She's just there and they are not. So it feels like she's just lucky.Overall it's not a movie you need a brain for. Obviously. And the director should have had someone read the script. But if you love action you will have a ton of fun with the movie and that's just how it is. Not all movies need to be super deep. This one will for sure be talked a lot about when people talk about guilty pleasure movies and stupid flicks you watch when bored. But it does feel like a miss overall because of the 2-3 scenes that make zero sense and the lack of clear theme. Hopefully the director will improve his craft.Still, go watch it. You won't regret it.",Run Hide Fight

Make this move, grab the gun (or knife) and take him down"". Well, those videos should be titled How to get yourself killed in a robbery.

The action was pretty great.Of course, the reality in which this film operates is lackingThere seemed to be no cafeteria monitors in there, and peple would come running to see what happened in the cafeteria.The ""they vote on the school shooting plan"" do we REALLY think a school shooter would look at the plan before doing this? I don't think that's entirely true...but hey, it's about the propaganda pointsThe administrators and staff being incompetent is another point of railing against bureaucracy, same w the cops and SWAT until they have to get in the protagonist's wayShe picks off the shooters here and there, and gets to the head cheese, and kills him, leaving him to bleed out. That was unlike the beginning sceneShe sees her deceased Mother every so often and it seems like it's to give Zoe depth...it doesn't. She exists to run, hide and fightI didn't care about the protagonist that much, her friend though seemed like a well played and drawn character.The motives for the shooters were idiotic. Bullying isn't the reason a school shooter situation happens. Every school would experience one if that were the case. i call bull on thatThe long and short of it: It's a propaganda piece that defies any real story or necessary logic and tells you what to think, nor does it give you compelling or complex characters to root for. It's flat, and terribly straightforward but does keep the action. The setup though, is biring af and the foreshadowing us meh.

No -- as carrying a gun (AND all the required Training) carries with it a great responsibility. It's something to think about very carefully. If not a gun; at least find some way to fight back!

61,RetroRick,"Good movie, well actied & scripted but ultimately making an argument",8,16 January 2021,"Good movie with a strong female lead.Reading other reviews is informative as it's easy to see the political divide here. The professional critics as far as I can make out have largely panned this film, while everybody else seems to appreciate it. That's surprising in some senses because in many ways the film is politically progressive in most respects: there is a strong female lead & an inter-racial relationship. In other ways though, this film violates the progressive platform by apparently being subtly pro-gun: this is a film about a school shooting incident that directs responsibility for those killed at the killers not the weapons they are using. Towards that end one of the killers uses not just guns but a large unpleasant looking hunting knife (although given the subject matter we are spared any kind of gore beyond a few bloodied bodies).Personally, being from the UK a country where guns are strictly controlled & not readily available to the public, I don't have a foot in either camp. I liked the film, thought it was persuasive in the main points it was making, but I can also see what it is 'doing' in presenting a school shooting situation in this way. Firstly, it could be criticized for presenting a school shooting situation in a slightly atypical way in order to argue its case. That's to say, the use of weapons in the situation that arises is not the over the top in a way that would directed the focus on to the rogue student's access to guns. Some school shooting seem to be indiscriminate massacres where the semi-automatic weapons become the focus because they create the possibility of a large number of deaths. In this film the antagonists do not kill indiscriminately but with a purpose in mind. Does that make things less realistic? Perhaps a little, but it is still well done & probably gets many of the motivations rights for the kids who go rogue.It's probably not that easy to sit on the fence on an issue as emotive as school shootings. In this film there are at least two instances where guns get an implied plug. The first is the security guard who is rendered powerless to act because his position does not permit him to carry a gun. This 'emasculation' is rammed home by his humiliation, in the face of the threat of death of the fact that he wets himself. Most of us would probably do similarly in such a situation, but here this is more than just a detail: we see the security guard return to his office & before anything else, before trying to warn or save himself, prioritizing changing into a clean pair of pants.The second incident is not that much more subtle (spoiler ahead...... ) there is a scene toward the end where the heroine's life is literally saved when the enemy about to kill her is taken out by a sniper outside. Her saviour is her own father. The implication is positive one in many way: there is nothing a father wouldn't do to protect his children but equally it is as subtly manipulative as the kind we more commonly encounter in the other direction. A father actually being represented positively in the protective role that most fathers play is a good thing to see, yet at the same time it's also part of the argument: the guy with a gun has the capacity to perform good or evil. The guy without a gun is simply helpless & emasculated.I don't reject that argument. Banning everything may infantalise us, but equally, in respect to the wider argument, I'm not sure how the film could have coped polemically speaking with shooters who were simply out to massacre peopleIn terms of the action. This is pretty good. The film is well-paced, has good villains, with both vulnerabilities & shades of grey (I didn't quite get the whole hearing voices aspect - this seemed designed to indemnify the kids involved of responsibility). Despite being pro-gun, the film is anything but a shooting fest. There are few occasions where anyone but the villains use a gun. We know the heroine can shoot because she has been trained to do so by her father, and on account of that we almost expect her to go John McClaine Die Hard on the villains. That doesn't happen. What we get instead is a very nuanced & humane heroine who manages to be both vulnerable and very tough at the same time. The lead actress does a sterling job & ironically pulls off a vastly more persuasive characterization of female leadership in an extreme situation than what we are used to seeing in more obviously progressive movies. It's this subtlety that makes the film something more than a pro-gun film. Indeed it certainly isn't a pro-gun film in the sense that it doesn't glorify guns in any way but does try to make the case for why people should have the right to carry.Altogether, a good movie with some persuasive arguments, but for that same reason not quite dispassionate treatment that might have given us a truer picture of what ultimately remains a major societal problem in - at least - north America",Run Hide Fight

The use of her dead mother to explain Zoe's own depression and finding reason to live was flat out just genius.Each of the 3 male antagonists were completely different in their character:the complete narcissist sociopath who couldn't overcome his own ego for self-attention that he was actually distracted from lustful desires of the Spanish teacherthe mentally ill hearing demon archetypethe emotionally scarred bullied type.Sadly very little was given on the 4th member, the girl.Zoe did not come off at all like a comic book hero.

69,terrencepatrix,Genuinely surprised how well balanced this movie was,7,16 January 2021,"To get it out of the way immediately...there are NO POLITICS IN THIS MOVIE. Praise be unto Jebus, I am so sick of politics being injected into everything, I just want to be entertained for a little bit and this did that job which is why it's getting a 7. Now to be fair, in the scope of ALL movies a 7 is a bit high on how I personally grade, I just found this to be a welcome surprise so I gave it an extra point or so.Honestly this is sort of an high school version of 'Die Hard' and it actually did a pretty good job at it. A terrorist take over, a mix of henchmen, a somewhat charismatic antagonist (no one will ever be better than Alan Rickman though, RIP), and a out gunned reluctant protagonist.Finally I'm amazed that that they even got something like this done, an action film about a school shooting? That's a hard sell. I don't like that stuff, I've never watched a documentary or movie about it because I was in high school when the Columbine incident happened, I went through lockdown training, and it's real life terrifying. And this was sort of sickening too I'll admit when it began, so I understand and also warn people if they don't like this or aren't sure if they can watch it. It's not super graphic but...it's mass shooting teens in a school. That is not something anyone really wants to see on screen...but it is a reality as unfortunate as that is, so...why not make an action movie out of it I suppose? You might not agree, I respect that.Back to there being no politics, the shooters are a mix of basically what the past several culprits have been. The chronically bullied, one with mental health issues, a sociopath looking for fame and grandeur, and a girlfriend willing to do anything out of a sick sense of devotion. These are all past motivations for teen murders and mass shootings. And then a heroin uses her wits, not some bizarre strength to beat everyone into submission when she's 90lbs, to save the day and as many people as she can.Overall a good action flick to just relax with. It's easy to love the protagonist, easy to hate the antagonist, and you get a satisfying conclusion without any overarching message. It's just an action flick.

73,PaxD75,"Great film written for demanding users. Believable, naturally flowing.",9,19 January 2021,"As I'm watching the start of the film, I truly did not think I was going to enjoy what was coming. I've seen too many TV/Films with cute, too thin, young blonde girls playing the part of the chosen one. I'm sick of them. I can no longer suspend disbelief.To make matters worse, the film starts off with the lead character playing angry with the world. She's angry, angry at her father, angry at her teachers, angry at her best friend, just angry. It's an entitled anger too - one where everyone else needs to apologize for existing. Ugh!My finger was on the stop button. I'm ready to walk away...Suddenly, the bad guys appear - led by the remarkable villainy of Tristan Voy (played by Eli Brown). Incredible role, incredible character that establishes the tone for the entire film.Zoe Hull (played by Isabel May) segues into an equally remarkable counterpart, displaying acting abilities that really impressed me. I was so engaged that I felt I was in her shoes.The best part of this film (and I truly wish more films were made this way) was how natural everything played out. Anyone of us could have been in Zoe's situation, anyone one of us might have done the same exact things.This is what makes this film stand out. There were few scenes that had you questioning the validity (in real life terms) of the various exchanges between the bad guys, their victims, the school officials and the scenes the lead protagonist engaged in.The premise does not do this film justice. It's easy to assume that remarkable events play out in such a way that you need to suspend disbelief. They do not. This is just a great, well done film written for the demanding consumer. They nailed it. Films like these help restore your faith in the industry.Rating this a 9.

But when a few reviewers criticized this film for ripping off Die Hard, I had to think about it more to realize the similarities. Sure there were similarities, but saying Run Hide Fight was a ripoff of Die Hard is like saying Venom was a ripoff of Dances With Wolves. And Venom had a lot more in common with Dances With Wolves than did this film with Die Hard.And speaking of Dances With Wolves, remember Avatar, the one nominated for best picture? Otherwise known as Dances With Smurfs or Dances With Wolves in Space? And The Last Samurai, also known as Dances With Wolves in Japan? Boy, the critics sure did give those films a pass. Don't get me wrong, those films were also very enjoyable. Each added enough new twists to make them worth watching. But the critics giving those films a pass and not this one sure does show blatant bias.The similarties between this film and Die Hard were minute and easily forgotten. That's because the cast, acting and storytelling made it such an intense, gripping film to watch. It's easily one of the best films of 2020.As a side note, it's refreshing to see such an intelligent but obscure film like Heathers continue to be referenced today in film, TV and even in Tiktok.",Run Hide Fight

81,cyberknight,Epilogue (spoiler for the film sequel!),1,4 February 2021,"EPILOGUE: ""In the previous episode of 'Run Hide Fight', we watched the protagonist, Zoe, picking up her father's rifle when she saw the villain, Tristan, trying to escape from the police, after having simulated his immolation by burning a random student in his place. She went after him and shot him once on the left side of his chest, leaving him to die a slow and painful death alone in a brook. But she's not an evil person, so she alerts the police about him. Will he still be alive when they arrive at the brook?""Well, that doesn't matter, because, on Earth, Justice cannot be delivered by common citizens, meaning, if Tristan is found dead, Zoe will be prosecuted, charged for murder of an unarmed man, it doesn't matter if that man was a mass murderer. If he's found alive, he will sue her for injuries and attempted murder, and he will win the case, for sure, because that's exactly what happened: she shot him with a long range rifle, without giving him a chance to defend himself. She could have alerted the Police, instead of going after him alone. Oh yes, the Laws of Man are so unfair. How can they deny a man (or a girl, in this case) the sweet, divine taste of revenge?I rated this film six stars before starting writing about it, and I finally have to agree, it's a zero star film (one, by IMDb's system). Was it the worst film I have ever seen? Of course not, that place is reserved to ""Natural Born Killers"" (1994), not because that one is plain bad, but because it had so much potential and wasted it all in a pretentious pile of crap. No, this film is not NBK-level of bad, this one is just plain bad.The script is forced, just like other proper reviewers pointed. For example, the protagonist has her leg shot, becoming both slower and faster than a healthy person at the convenience of the plot. Also, unless USA school locker doors are made of laminated titanium, somewhat like RoboCop's body armour (and even so), I'm absolutely sure it cannot stop a bullet shot at a right angle.Even ignoring inconsistencies on the plot, the main problem is the plot itself. Gathering four sociopaths in the same school is a long stretch, but it's possible, I guess, maybe there's something in the city water (should count five, because the protagonist is also a nut-job, and possibly six, counting her father, although he, at least, have the excuse of being a war veteran), but it pushes suspension of disbelief to the limit.Then, comes the end... So, the motivation for all the killings was to become famous and, then, disappear anonymously?! After that, the long string of MacGuffins crumble. For example, why go the trouble of cutting landlines and Internet cables if they ask (actually, they demand) people to call their parents or police or whoever to tell them about what they are doing? Why kill anyone trying to escape, if they want to spread the news?Moreover, why the lockdown? To gather more hostages? Why, what for, to make things so much more complicated to manage? Is that what took the villain over a year to plan?! Damn, is he dumb or what!If he wanted to become famous, ""bodycountwise,"" why not kill everybody from the very beginning? The school was full of nobodies, he could have killed one group after another and rank up! Did he plan to explode everybody in one place, was that it? Bullets are too expensive? Didn't seem like money was an issue for the villain. After over a year of testing, he should've known that the improvised explosives he gathered in the van wouldn't be able to kill anybody (they barely burnt the van as it ran out of the school, in the most underwhelming explosion scene in the whole history of Cinema...)Talking about ammunition, the female shooter not having another clip was just too stupid. ""Yes, let's go on a killing spree, but I can only kill so many if they line up, because I only have one clip..."" And she'd have to prey that people wouldn't hide inside RoboCop-certified lockers!Going back to the protagonist, why did she have to talk to her dead mother? Sure, mother issues... For what? For dying and leaving her ""alone"" with her father? Sure, he seems to be a pain in the end of the digestive tract, but so what? That literally added nothing to the plot and felt very dumb, mainly when she vanished (I think there was some important life lesson there, or epiphany, or whatever/whatnot, but I quite failed to grab it). And that scene of her talking to the ""dead mother in the mirror"" should have been reshot, re-edited or digitally enhanced, because the actress' hand can be seen moving behind the protagonist, completely breaking the ""it's all in her head"" illusion.Whoever wrote the script, expected people to act like non-player characters (NPC) in a videogame. Couldn't anyone hear the shots? Wouldn't anyone have the ""brilliant"" idea of jumping out through a window and run away? Oh, sure, lockdown! No one wants to infuriate a teacher, right? Better sit on the cold gym floor, in the dark, waiting for the killers to come in shooting.Someone mentioned ""Die Hard"" (1988) and I have to agree, this is pretty much a copy of that film, minus Bruce Willis and Alan Rickman, plus seriousness that is definitely not recommended in such a disaster film.The writers went as far as showing how incompetent and inefficient the Police Force is (even S.W.A.T., mind you!), making them arrest the protagonist (with unnecessary brutality, of course, because that's surely how trained police officers are in real life) and her father (after he shot one of the killers dead). Oh, but don't worry, the protagonist is released on the next scene, thanks to the local sheriff, because he knew better than the S.W.A.T., and she was surely not a suspected accomplice (and it would have been difficult for her to go kill the villain in the last scene handcuffed).I have to say something about the song at the end credits. Like the rest of the film, it was unnecessary and so uncalled for!In the end, the hunting scene in the very beginning is the only killing I really felt something about, and while I think about it, I remove the last star I left for this film.",Run Hide Fight

They paint the police as completely useless through the end, which was the biggest plot hole and did bother me throughout the film. But there's tons of Hollywood films that conveniently make the help impossible to reach as well.Honestly the biggest issue to me was the streaming quality. The frames would skip periodically and the audio quality was horrible.

Sometimes though, like once in a blue moon, you feel as though you watched a Movie, with a capital M.
'Run hide fight' is just like that. No tricks, just honest, straightforward action all the way.
It tells it's story as a movie should, through cinematic narrative; it's got framing, proper build up of characters and scenes. The acting is great, the characters are relatable, their motivations are understandable. The film is true to it's genre, there's plenty of action, but never over-the-top. It's got just the right pacing, just the right ammount of suspense. I must admit, I'm a bit partial to Thomas Jane's work, the guy just has that ""I'm dead serious"" face that works perfectly in these kind of movies. The rest of the cast, the lead role especially, does a terrific job as well.
As for the story, it's simple: a grief-stricken teenage girl is ""at war"" with the world. Her fright and fear bleeds into anger and fury which enables her to rise to the occasion and be the hero of the day when a group of school shooters wreak heavoc on the very day everyone's supposed to have fun.

Doesnt sound compelling, especially given the gun climate we live in today. However this was a really interesting story, good pacing and some interesting twists. It was the right length too.

101,ed-503-465183,I was surprised by this movie. It was a pretty good action movie.,8,21 July 2021,"Right off the bat, this was a complete work of fiction, an action movie in the truest sense of that genre. This is a movie that you have to let go of and enjoy the ride. Think Die Hard in a high school, and Bruce Willis is a young pretty girl.While very little in the film seemed plausible or realistic, it did a good job sucking me in and suspending my disbelief for much of the ride, and, most importantly, it entertained me, which was its primary objective.I think it was one of the better action movies produced over the last decade. The actors all did a fantastic job, the characters you are supposed to like you like, and the ones you are supposed to hate, well, you hate. You'll find no ambiguity here. It's good vs. Evil, which is typical for this genre.The movie deals with a sensitive topic some might find disturbing, school shootings. There is violence and blood, but it wasn't over the top for this film genre.In my opinion, this would be a movie that might be appropriate for an older teenager. There aren't any profound messages or revelations to be found here, but I don't expect that in an action movie, and neither should you.I thought the casting was spot on. The actors all did a great job. Isabel May did a good job playing the movie's main protagonist Zoe, and Eli Brown did a good job playing the main villain, Triston. The supporting cast on both sides of the aisle on this one also did a good job. Other notable performances were made by Olly Sholotan, who played Zoe's best friend, and Britton Sear, who played a nutjob underling of Triston. Again, you're not going to find deep introspection in this one; remember, it's an action movie.The production value was pretty damn good. It was a much better film than Netflix or Hollywood studios are turning out today.Anyone who likes action movies, and is willing to suspend disbelief, will enjoy this one. I'm not a big fan of action movies, and I enjoyed it.",Run Hide Fight

107,sithstalker-75789,A female lead worth watching,9,11 September 2021,"Don't get me wrong there are plenty of talented actresses out there but it seems as of late that hollywood seems to put there female leads on a pedestal high above their male Co stars and very often at their expense. This film does not do that and as hard as I can appreciate the subject matter must've been quite difficult to watch or even hear of a film like this for certain individuals, one thing not to forget is that this is a movie not a documentary and it is meant for entertainment purposes only.Just because a film might show dismestic abuse, scenes of suicide or other difficult subjects does not mean that we should not stil allow them to exist. Living in Britain we don't have many mass school shootings but there have been some very well known ones and already having read some of the views I definitely believe this film is is going to divide the crowd.Personally I thoroughly enjoyed this film throughout for what it was a film. I thought the pacing was excellent, the lead actress Isabel May was fantastic and yeah there's a few die hard references in there too for you old movie buffs. It's a shame to see Thomas Jane and Rhada Mitchell given only minor roles here seeing as I rate them both as talented professionals but like I said earlier I thought the stand out role has to go to our heroine and the main villain played his part nicely too.I thought it was also quite refreshing to see that there was no mention of neo nazis or white supremacists in this movie it was just nice to watch an action packed film with a unsettling story for some just play out over its 1 hour and 44 minute run time.Reading some reviews on here it baffles me why some people have seem to bash this film without giving an explanation as to why they didn't enjoy it but I spose in the world of twitter and facebook this old man just doesn't understand why people take life so seriously and can't be a bit happier and more thankfull for what they have but that's just me.This is definitely not one for the kids to watch parents so bare that in mind but if you can put your ideologies and prejudices aside for the films run time and just enjoy it for what it is I think a lot of people are gonna have a blast with this film.I haven't bothered (and never do) to look at critic reviews coz let's face it most of them or either so far out of touch with reality or just bought and payed for shills by the film companies but as always I end my reviews by saying that taste is subjective. Don't just take my word for it watch and decide for yourself and see what you think.Hope as many of you are keeping as safe as you possibly can in these difficult times and be kind to yourself and to others xx.",Run Hide Fight
108,saiken-30341,"Professional reviewers are a joke. Sadly. However,",6,18 January 2021,Just because the professional reviewers have used their power to try to sink this movie doesn't make it the best movie of all time. The reviewers are intellectually dishonest in failing to do their job in reviewing the movie on it's relative merits.I like Thomas Jane and am predisposed to watching this mostly for that reason. It's a school shooting / invasion movie with a cast of mostly youthful actors. The protagonist uses her survival / hunting training and her moxie to push back. If that sounds like a movie you should see this one. Overall 6/10. In the context of a Diehard type of movie this is a 8/10.,Run Hide Fight
109,ChrisinDesMoines,Good edge of your seat movie that will keep your attention,8,19 January 2021,"I'll be honest, I'm writing this review only because I saw a hit piece review on a website that was more critical of who released the movie than the plot and quality of the film itself.First the plot: A high school student finds herself in the middle of a school shooting and the title is a reference to her reaction. First, when she realizes what's occuring, she runs and when the group of shooters think they have someone on the loose, she ends up hiding. Soon after she realizes that she needs to try and save as many of her students as possible resulting in the ""fight"" portion of the movie. As a western fan, it's the same story told a thousand times just modernized to a high school instead of a community. Bad guys ride into town and the sheriff knows that he's going to need to confront the bad guys in order to save the community.This time, instead of El Dorado it's public high school in any town, USA.Second the acting and production: This isn't a highly polished Marvel or Clint Eastwood film, but is a film that if you were told Clint Eastwood was going to make, you would totally get it. The acting is really good and something you would expect from a high quality film. Most are actors that I've seen in other films, mostly in supporting roles, and it's obvious that few budget cuts took place in that department. The cinematography was a little less than I would expect from a highly polished film but well above the quality seen in low budget films. Think Rocky 1 compared to the rest of the franchise. Audio was a little below what you expect in a high quality polished movie. But to be fair, I've done TV, so my expectations might be a little high or too demanding. Truth is that I doubt most would even notice. If the producer made budgetary decisions to come under a specific budget, from my POV, he made fantastic decisions.Third the Daily wire: I'm a subscriber. I'm not ashamed of my political views and generally speaking I agree with Ben Shapiro. But as a fellow conservative who is a free thinker, I watch Shapiro and the rest of the Daily Wire because I'm interested in his opinion and why he has them, not to receive marching orders. I do agree with his views most of the time but strongly disagree on some topics, such as Net Neutrality, for example. I subscribed because after the election I could see the writing on the wall. Parlor and the social media purge that took place in recent weeks and they didn't want or needed an excuse. I'm on a tight budget but I felt that it was necessary to provide financial support when and where I could to conservative publications. The TV experience I spoke of earlier? PBS. I supported financially when I could and volunteered as often as I could. Out of all the conservative publications I follow Ben Shapiro is the one I watch/read the most but the one I also disagree with the most. He's also the one I respect the most.I watched the premier and watched the Sunday interview with the producer. They referred to ""Christian"" and politically right wing media as ""alter call"" movies and this is something that I've said about Christian movies for some time. Facing the Giants and Fireproof are okay movies. Good plot, okay production quality, but I only purchased those films because I feel the need to support the ones making the product, not because the product was good. You're not buying the little kid next door Kool aid made with too little or too much sugar because it's good, it's not, but because you want them to be successful and move onto bigger and better things. This is the dawn of bigger and better things. This isn't a ""political agenda"" driven movie like many reviewers are claiming, this is a good movie that was supported by a political publication.Unlike some of the ""legitimate"" movie reviews I'm reading more and more frequently, I can be objective in my reviews. I liked the movie because of the plot and quality of the product. I'll tell you the shortcomings I think they could have done better on, but I won't slam a movie based on the people who produced it.If you like intense movies with action? Check it out. I suspect you'll like it",Run Hide Fight
110,scorpiogemini,Gut wrenching and intense,8,23 January 2021,"I'm used to violence on screen so I have become somwhat numb to it understandably. School shooting scenarios with teenagers murdering their peers though, is on an other level for me.I started watching this movie with no expectations but Isabel May turned out to be an awesome actress. There movie has real cinematic shoots and both Isabel and Eli Brown (the group leader of the killers) are great. Cyrus and Britton are very convincing aswell.Yes maybe it was too in our face with Zoe having a hunter background (also I have a hard time with hunting animals for sport thing) . Maybe Tristan was way too charismatic as a teenage killer, and the last half part of the movie and the ending were a bit predictible, but it was intense and well done!I don't have any hopes of this movie starting up debates in Usa about gun laws as over the past decades the world have witnessed so many school shootings and still nothing has changed in Usa about gun laws sadly and maybe, maybe this movie can show us small parts of how the victims of school shootings may have felt during gun point...",Run Hide Fight

117,srjohannes,It's not as bad as some people say but it's not good either,2,13 February 2021,"Run Hide Fight is a film that needed to be made, but it's unfortunate that it wasn't done right. Now I'm not taking sides here, a lot of people are dumping on this film for being made by The Daily Wire, but I don't care about any of that, I'm just looking at this as a film.I have to complement the tension that the film has and you also feel the emotional weight. But that's really it.The writing in this film sucks. It's really bad at times and it can be good, but that's rare, it's mostly pretty crappy. The film suffers immensely from the writing. Also the acting is really good for some characters, but it's really bad for others.My main issue with this film is the main shooter kid. He is horrifically bad. They're trying to make a character like Hans Gruber, they try to make him a good villain, but he's not. They write him as if he's trying to make the audience laugh, he says things that seem like they should be funny, but does the audience laugh, no. Why? It doesn't work with the situation at hand. It conflicts with the tone. It's disgusting that they wrote this character this way, it's almost like they're trying to make him likable. Besides that, he has this whole agenda. He's trying to prove a point by shooting up the school. He's trying to fix the world like he's a Mission: Impossible villain. It's embarrassing how unrealistic this is, it makes the film feel like a factory made movie, not a real film that you can escape in. This film feels like a basic action film and it needs to be so much more.This film is basically Die Hard. A person is in the wrong place at the wrong time and tries to help hostages by taking out terrorists. It could work if it was toned down in comparison to Die Hard, but it doesn't because it's unrealistic, it's exaggerated.The exposition is awful. It's very unrealistic and dumb. There's a prank day at school, seriously? There has to be a romance. There are kids flipping off our main characters on the road. It's all stupid, making for a horrible and nearly unbearable first 30 minutes.Throughout the film, the main characters dead mother, who is in her mind, talks to her and it's horrible. She doesn't need to be there, it's dumb, and she's really is there to tell the audience what is going on. Unnecessary.It's stupid how it takes the school forever to lock down the building. It's unrealistic.At the end of the film, there's another shooter who goes to plant another bomb. WHY? That's so stupid, it's unrealistic, it's unnecessary, it feels tacked on because it is, and it ruins the ending, which wasn't really all that good anyways, but it could've been improved massively by removing this element.This film is not terrible even though I kind of ripped it apart, it's just that this film had so much opportunity and had a need to be made, but it was turned into a Die Hard movie with bad writing. This film needed to be better and it's unfortunate that it's not what it needed to be. Despite that, you could watch it, it's not the worst thing in the world, but it's not a must watch. I rate Run Hide Fight a 5/10.",Run Hide Fight

Trying to appeal to liberals or the left is a waste of time because they will criticise it because it's a Daily Wire movie. You can't win. As a rightwing viewer, I was disappointed that the movie didn't really get away from identity politics. The main character was a kick-ass girl. The shooters were all white.

That being said, I love dark, edgy and provocative films that push boundaries, test morality, etc. I think a thriller set during a school shooting can totally be a fantastic and nail biting experience if done well. But this is garbage. Any and all politics and/or beliefs aside, it's just a genuinely awful movie. From nobody outside the cafeteria hearing a van plummet through a wall with gunfire, to absolutely atrocious writing and dialogue, to the dull and obnoxious shooters, to an hour long police response time, I just couldn't take a single moment seriously.

I have written books, wrote music albums and got published on the subject. privileged angry incel white boy. but it's just too easy. to find connection and genuine connection with anyone, let alone a whole room of people, now that's a challenge. i thought of a scene (no spoilers) in which the antagonist forces a female teacher to take her bra off. i first got annoyed with that behaviour to depict shooters as nothing but deranged psychos, but then i realised that it would have been the way i would have done it too- to completely disregard any of my own personal codex and just succumb to complete nihilism and why not just let the teachers strip. in that manner this movie spoke to me very realistically. a very important film, beautifully and tastefully shot with great acting and direction. its like Skynd's video Columbine but stretched out over one and a half hours. already movie of the year for me. nowadays i don't have the same HATE in me i had back then, i now have all the resources i need to try and be able to help others with the same type of HATE i had for so many years"". all the while very aware of how many others there still are out there who does not have what i have.
i am thinking about another scene (no spoilers) in which the protagonist asks ""why?"" to the antagonist and he answers something in the likes of ""because they were always giggling behind my back"" and she replies ""did you ever think they were giggling just because they were happy?"" no other film or book has spoken to me with such clarity on the subject.",Run Hide Fight

126,ReaLMoisan,Honest Observations: It's a Bad Movie.,3,18 January 2021,"A list of nitpicks, plot contrivances, and plot holes in order of appearance, not severity. This movie might have one the worst plot holes in film history.-Zoe shoots, but doesn't kill the deer. Todd does a monologue instead of shooting the deer. Also, using a stone to finish off the deer is illegal in North America. Its alarming Todd only raises an eyebrow at this.-When the van drove through the window, no one was run over. Scene cuts back, two people were hit by the van. Later, we find out a third person was also hit by the van.-Nobody hears multiple gun shots from a shotgun and other firearms outside the cafeteria. A 12-gauge is insanely loud at 150-165dB. With a perceived volume about sixteen times louder than the front row of a rock concert.-It's a trope, but even if air ducting could hold someone's weight, it would be insanely loud when Zoe crawls across it. At least Zoe fell through the drop ceiling, some movies have people crawling on drop ceiling.-Tristan lets the students call or text anyone. No one calls the police. None of the people the students called or texted contacted the police either.-Everyone in that school would know what's happening right away once those first calls and texts went out. Once one person in a classroom knows, the whole classroom knows.-The administration knows where and what is happening after Tristan talks to the office on the phone, so every teacher would know right after. All faculty in North American schools have a mobile group contact method just for such situations.-There would be a lock-down announcement over the PA, or an alarm triggered to let all the other students and faculty know. The office woman would have contacted the police herself. Land lines may be cut, but obviously cells phones work.-At the utility panel, Anna cuts the internet and network lines, not the phone lines. The BIX block with the phone lines was to the left of the network panel, which was the wires she cut.-Everyone starts streaming, and again, the police aren't contacted and then respond in minutes. Also, Lewis is filming vertically. This is the movies biggest crime (yes, that's a joke).-A security guard runs into the cafeteria armed with a nightstick, knowing armed assailants are inside. Also, he acts surprised for some reason, even though he's escorting the principle who's aware of the situation.-Zoe finally pulls the fire alarm, which should have been the first thing someone did. Also, cutting the fire alarm after it's already triggered doesn't stop the fire department from responding.-The amount of time that's passed before the police is contacted is over twenty minutes. Not that it matters, the police and S. W. A. T. only stand around in the parking lot anyway. It's a major issue throughout the movie.-It also takes over twenty minutes for the school to do a lock-down announcement after knowing about the situation too. They say it's because the police have to be contacted before they can announce a lock-down, yet the office didn't call the police themselves.-Kip places a backpack with a bomb in front of the administration office desk of a huge high school, and no one notices for hours. High school offices are high traffic locations, and that bag wasn't concealed at all. Also, on prank day, you'd think people would be more watchful of such irregularities.-There's a live stream that started with over a thousand viewers, and it's now been live another fifteen minutes, and the police are still unaware of the stream. That's insanely valuable logistical information about the perpetrators numbers and locations, and their weapons, yet no one tells the cops, or even sends them a link.-Zoe takes cover behind a locker door to stop bullets. The movie trope of anything providing cover from firearms continues. It shows the first and forth shot missing, but the second shot is blocked by the door, and they don't show where the third shot hits.-After the first cop on the scene Tommy arrives, it takes another fifteen minutes before more police arrive. Even though Sheriff Tarsy told Tommy on the phone to wait, he was ""only two minutes away"". So, it took the police thirty five minutes to officially respond to a school shooting. This is ridiculous.-Todd takes a whole deer carcass home, and doesn't start gutting the deer for hours. They shot the deer and were home before 8 a.m., and it's now the afternoon. We also know its summer too. No hunter would wait this long to start field dressing an animal, especially in those temperatures.-They show the cops outside looking over blueprints when Zoe calls them. None of them are watching the stream, or the newscast showing the stream. Again, this is highly valuable logistical information, and it's an issue throughout the movie.-Lewis filmed the van bombs on his stream, yet the police are still unaware. No one tells the police, also, the police would have combed through the live stream for all possible logistical information already, same with S. W. A. T. on the drive over.-After fifteen minutes of a heavy police force being present, and them knowing the location of all the perpetrators via the live stream (two shooters, both in cafeteria, other two dead or handcuffed), they do nothing. They don't contact teachers with an exit strategy, and they don't go in to extract either.-After Tristan gave Zoe the ultimatum, the police would have contacted Zoe immediately after. They would never let her go into the cafeteria under those circumstances. Also, I guess hostage negotiators aren't a thing either. This is another issue with the movie.-After Tristan talks with Zoe, he shoots another person, while S. W. A. T. have arrived, and they do nothing. There's only two shooters left and they're on a live stream, in close proximity to each other, in a huge room with multiple access points, with multiple shooting lines. With such a high body count, plus the presence of that much explosives with no dead man switch. S. W. A. T. Would have acted immediately.-Zoe and Lewis get away from Chris, when Zoe is limping like she has a peg leg, and Tristan is badly wounded. They get just over a ten second head start, then lay in the hallway for thirty five seconds, while only being one corner away from where Chris exited the cafeteria after them.-Then Zoe and Tristan drag themselves into a classroom, and don't close the door behind them. Even though Chris should be right on their heels.-After Tristan tells Zoe the van is rigged to explode, Zoe doesn't give one of the two phones she had in her possession to Tristan, so he can tell the police. They show Zoe having two cell phones in the gymnasium scene earlier too.-Todd shoots Chris from a lower position, through glass, and closed vinyl blinds. Todd is also outside, on a bright summer day, using a scope, while Chris is standing in the middle of a large, unlit room.-After Todd shoots Chris, S. W. A. T. know there is only one shooter left. They should also know there are a lot of explosives in the van too, and already be in position to take out any shooter in the cafeteria. They would end the situation immediately.-A teacher is running around, still getting students out, one class at a time. So the police and S. W. A. T. are just letting a teacher run around getting students out one class at a time. Again, they don't contact the teachers and tell them where and how to exit, and they don't go in to extract them either.-After the van explodes, we see a heavily armoured and armed S. W. A. T. team run towards the school. I guess they didn't acquire tactical positions yet. They've been there twenty five minutes at least, yet they're standing around with an entire parking lot full of vehicles between them and the school.-So Zoe sees S. W. A. T. entering the school, but a limping, and unarmed Zoe is going to save the day. Yes, because people specifically trained for this situation with tactical equipment, body armour, and assault riffles would be useless against a high school student with a revolver. I know, Zoe wears her fathers military jacket, but I think she'd let the experts take over.-Of course, Tristan just walks out of the already evacuated school, after having his face on every screen all day. I guess the police, students, teachers, parents, news agencies, S. W. A. T, and at least one helicopter we can hear must have missed him.-Zoe doesn't tell anyone that Tristan left with another student before the van exploded, and the body they found burned wasn't Tristan. She's literally at a police cruiser, with police all around her, but she walks away to get the rifle the police didn't bother collecting. Again, don't tell the police, and let the experts in tactical equipment, body armour, and assault rifles take care of the situation.-Yet again, Zoe goes after Tristan. All those people don't notice Zoe, someone who should be really popular right about now, go and pick up a huge rifle, and go limping off in broad daylight.-Zoe picks up the rifle that Todd used to shoot Chris earlier. As Todd says ""it should be right where I left it."" You mean where four S. W. A. T. officers had arrested Todd earlier after he shot and killed Chris. Oh, that spot. I guess police just ignore a loaded high power rifle recently used to kill someone when they arrest the shooter. This is beyond stupid. This is one of the biggest plot holes I've seen in any film. It's insane how ridiculous this is.-Then Zoe shoots Tristan, who's not even holding his revolver at the time. This is murder. I know Tristan is a scum bag, and Zoe would want revenge, but its still murder. All of this occurs so close to the school, we can see police cruisers in the background.-Despite being within rock throwing distance of the school and hundreds of people, no one reacts to the rifle shot. No one shows up for the one minute and forty seconds that transpire between the time Zoe pulls the trigger and when she walks away while Tristan dies.",Run Hide Fight

128,joe12361,Lack of Imagination,5,30 January 2021,"This film should never have been made. The problem with evil is, it's utter lack of imagination, and how it so readily misunderstands reality. It can't see past its own squalor and depravity. Evil only flourishes when good people do nothing. I was disgusted and appalled at this film - it creates very strong feelings of revulsion. Technology can be used either for good or evil. Here, it was used predominantly for evil. But in and of itself, it is almost entirely neutral. A mere tool. A hammer can be used for nailing a house together, or it can be used to bludgeon someone to death with. The tool itself is neither inherently good nor evil, it's the manner in which it's used that matters. Because this film engenders such a high level of despair, I would just like to leave this review with a note of optimism; it's a quote from a book, which when I first read it almost broke my heart, both because it's a subject close to my heart, but also because of the tragedy (and fatality, obviously) of death, if not perhaps its finality. But it's the hope (and belief of the faithful), which springs eternal, that death is not final, that creates all that is good in the world and makes the human spirit resilient in the face of adversity. Anyway, I digress, and the quote is as follows, verbatim:""This book is a sequel to my Beginner's Guide to Mathematical Logic [Smullyan, 2014]. I originally intended both volumes to be a single volume, but I felt that at my age (now 96), I could pass away at any time, and I wanted to be sure that I would at least get the basic material out""Raymond Smullyan, writing in the Preface to ""A Beginner's Further Guide to Mathematical Logic"", in the first half of 2016.Indeed it proved sadly that Mr Smullyan's fears were well-founded. But contrast his words, which indicated sad resignation at his own mortality (not because of the fact he might soon pass away per se, but rather that he still had positive things to contribute to this world, and thereby help impart useful information to others - the value of his insights and accumulated wisdom in his subject area) with those of the base and execrable ""instincts"" on display in this film, ostensibly also ""human"" ones, but only barely so. At its heart, his is/was an unselfish assessment of his plight/predicament. He wishes to live longer so that he can continue to serve other people usefully and purposefully. It's a spirit of generosity and humility that we would all do well to emulate, no matter how mundane our existences are, and of course the very act of living itself necessitates that we undergo mundane (and therefore by definition quotidian) experiences on a daily basis.",Run Hide Fight

Was quite surprised that it was so real looking and relevant to the way battered and bullied kids might react to ""get back"" at their evil piers. I myself was viscously attacked and subjected to taunts and torment from my 8th grade classmates at Cerro Villa Jr. High in Villa Park, CA. Back in the early 70's, I myself actually had a plan to kill ALL of these evil brats in a very creative way that would allow me to escape unknown. It never happened of course, but I was angry enough. Thank God that Jesus (Even before I was saved) provided a way of escape from that school and be transferred to another across town that allowed me to flourish, grow and make new friends and no enemies whatsoever. I believe if the teachers who KNEW what I was going through at Cerro Villa Jr. High, came along side and helped me and dealt with the bullying in a concise and sure disciplinary way, I would not have come to any conclusion of killing anyone. I believe that ALL the kids who do shoot up a school like this movie graphicly portrays, if they were noticed by the teachers of all the bullying they were going through to get them to that level of revenge thinking, then we wouldn't have the shooting incidents we've had. This movie is NOT ABOUT gun control stupidity or that guns are the problem, quite the contrary, if teachers had guns and neighbors had guns, it could have been avoided. It is well acted and portrays the ""weird"" kids who ""go off"" when provoked to a very high level. If you don't think this could happen to you, look again, we ALL could be pushed to a level of retribution if bullied bad enough!. Great movie Ben, Love your work. Keep it up!.

135,jacobsperling,"From a conservative, and Daily Wire subscriber and lover",4,13 June 2021,"I wasn't surprised that this film is not good, nor was I surprised that critics shredded it (undeservedly so, it wasn't THAT bad), nor was I surprised that audiences loved it.Why?Because audiences today don't give a damn about quality filmmaking. Most people today have never even heard of Akira Kurosawa, or Orson Welles, or Billy Wilder, to name a few masterful directors/writers. Most people today have never seen Double Indemnity, or All About Eve, or On the Waterfront, or Gone With the Wind, or Casablanca, to name a few masterpieces. Basically, the Christopher Nolans of the world are practically nonexistent.So movies like Run Hide Fight, similar to Taylor Sheridan's recent (also not good, but liked by audiences) ""Those Who Wish Me Dead"", which are not good but do contain an undeniably (extremely) tense, chilling atmosphere and first class acting (particularly Isabel May, who is absolutely fantastic) are liked by audiences because that's all audiences want (similar to the Marvel garbage that people flock to see). Therefore, most audiences will like this film, especially given the good acting and emotional weight. But that doesn't change the fact that Run Hide Fight is an unrealistic, plot-hole-filled movie, albeit with terrific acting . That's basically it in a nutshell.However, the reason it was shredded by critics and made out to be an awful piece of garbage (which, as stated, is an overstatement) is not for these flaws, so much as the fact that it was nonpolitical where it could have been radically leftist (which Thank God it's not), even with a few conservative themes, and the fact that it was distributed by the terrific conservative media outlet The Daily Wire, which, needless to say, leftists hate (shocker). It's not that awful of a movie. As stated, the acting is really well done, particularly by a phenomenal Isabel May as the gritty, courageous, mourning protagonist Zoe Hull (a very well-scripted character) and a terrifying performance by Eli Brown as the leader of the murderous shooters. Thomas Jane and Radha Mitchell turn in very good supporting performances as well.In short, it's not trash by any means, but it's not a good movie. That being said, critics undeservedly trashed it for its conservative leanings, and it's not surprising that audiences today liked it for its quality acting, tense atmosphere and emotional weight.",Run Hide Fight

RUN HIDE FIGHT has SOME GREAT MOMENTS and some CLEVER DEVICES making it memorable.Basically, a survivalist High School senior uses her grit and determination to save her classmates when a group of horrendous misfits broadcast a genocidal rampage of murder and mayhem at her school over social media.This film has many good qualities that made it fun for me and some poor qualities that momentarily pulled me out of the action. Overall, though, if you can leave your political and blockbuster budgeted expectations at the door, it was entertaining to watch. It was a parable of personal honor offered against a sea of modern day PC insanity.I enjoyed the acting and appreciated the camera work. Excellent attention to sound and lighting. The theme of self-determination and personal responsibility resonated with me. Even the unorthodox ending found its way into my soul, though it is contrary to modern cultural PC expectations, especially in Left leaning Americans.There were a few easily fixed logic flaws, but after watching Godzilla vs. King Kong anyone who complains about the anomalies should be ashamed of themselves.The theme and revelations offered to the viewer more than make up for the technical mistakes.

We know that there have been and probably will be shootings in schools in the United States, but this film is far from reality. During school shootings, the perpetrators are caught by the police for less than half an hour. I could not understand the motivation of the main antagonist throughout the film. And the motivation of the others who help him is that one of them is abnormal and hears voices. And the other had his pants taken off in class as a child and that's why he started killing people? No way!! The motivation of the main protagonist - the girl - is also not completely clear. She also sees her mother, who apparently died of cancer. But in real life, almost all civilians (not to mention all) will run away from the people who took out their weapons. And they won't be made into a sequel to ""Die Hard.""
Not to mention that the main protagonist is an ordinary girl and has no training in combat situations. I recommend you watch the series Hanna(2019), where you can see how many years of training in harsh conditions it takes for an 18-year-old girl to react adequately to a shootout.

As I was seeing the first scene, it got me interested after seeing Thomas Jane but I wasn't familiar with the lead actress Isabel May who reminded me a little of Florence Pugh, not only because of her looks but also her fire and spirit. The story of the film revolves around a group of deranged high school kids who decide to have a bloody shootout in their school on the senior prank day. But the moment they start killing kids like flies, it just triggers this bad feeling cause it actually resembles actual school shootouts which is not a really nice topic to be watching over the course of an entire film which is almost close to 2 hours. Now if we talk about the character played by Isabel May, the girl who single handedly managed to defeat the evil group and save the entire school, I have to say this certainly feels so unrealistic in the most possible way. I mean just because her dad was in the army and taught her how to hunt, she automatically became John Mcclane in Die Hard. Also i'm trying to understand how the group of shooters who are a bunch of teenagers managed to get rifles, weapons and bombs, and why does their leader even wants to do this, for fame, really that's it??? And why on earth does he brings with him a couple of incompetent dudes, including one who hears voices?? It feels that this film was trying to gather as many cliches and violence in one movie as possible, like the scene with the spanish teacher and how their leader Tristan asked her to take off her shirt!!!! Also the way they are so violent and aggressive, it just feels so unrealistic. And let's not forget the final scene when Tristan faked his own death and was hiding passport and money to flee, like he's some kind of a spy or James Bond. If I was a mentally deranged person and saw this film, I would surely be enticed to do what I just saw. I was terribly bothered by the violence towards students and how the story was so far fetched.

Ahm ... can't remember any of them, bang, rubber doll twitch, done.There is a review I read earlier where someone goes through all the plot holes, step by step; it is a very long review, with very many steps, like you would have to climb to visit an oriental temple in the mountains.I'll just add one of my own personal bug bears. A person, shot in the thigh, with a tournique made from a belt, running veritable marathons, not just through school corridors and cellars, but also through the woods, presumably hours now after the original injury.I'm just shaking my head. Why do you spend so much time assembling the cast and making this movie, but pay no attention to basic things like that?And leaving that expensive sniper rifle in the woods ... that the police failed to pick up ... oh, just stop, I could go on and on and on ...A missed opportunity of epic proportions, and may become a fan favourite with certain people.

172,richardpickren,Well made. Great casting.,8,5 February 2021,"Overall this is a very fine effort. The film focuses on the utter helplessness of a high school when a group of psychopathic fellow students with explosives and guns take over the school. The events portrayed in the film are chillingly similar to the Parkland, Florida horror. Run Hide Fight tacitly questions the false security of gun free zones in a very realistic and convincing manner.David Guglielmo's casting is superb. The film succeeds because Guglielmo has cast actors (largely unknown) that are close enough in age to the high school students they are portraying. Generally, the young cast turns in very solid performances.
Eli Brown's performance as psychopath Tristan is very good. Isabel May's performance as Zoe is strong but a bit uneven. At times, May has a tendency to overact. Director Rankin could've used a stronger hand reining her in. Zoe's scenes with her mother (deceased) played by Rhada Mitchell are moving and revealing.
Treat Williams turns in a solid performance as Sheriff Tarsy, too.
The direction and cinematography is also very good. Definitely worth a watch.",Run Hide Fight

175,nickijjohnson-16955,Realistic Topic with Unrealistic Storyline,5,17 January 2021,"I think in general it was a good movie with unrealistic qualities and peppered with cliches. One of the main cliches of a lot of horror movies is one of the characters is a doctor which is foreshadowing to all the knowledge that they'll possess when crap goes down. Setting a broken arm or leg, stitching something, tourniquets. One of the main cliches of an action film is that the hero goes hunting or is military trained and I'm no feminist but this is especially true for female leads (IE. Split, The Hunt, Haywire) but when it's a male lead often they just miraculously know how to use a gun no backstory required. I digress. This film opens up with her hunting with her father and not only that but she has the balls to smash a rock over a deer's head when she doesn't get her shot. An in your face I'm not your average girl moment to set up our heroine. The villain himself is cliche as well. The problem is he's supposed to be in high school. He behaves more like an adult villain rather than teenage. He's too confident, too calm and rational, and too much of a mastermind considering the ending. Kids that shoot up schools are usually more unhinged. I also understand this movie was made by conservatives but it doesn't make conservatives look good. Considering all the buzz about Trump supporters being crazy having a movie starring a kid that is likely conservative who shoots up a school is not a good look. That's simply going off the ""see how hard is it to build a wall"" line. Great cast, great acting, and a good watch just unrealistic but it's an action movie.",Run Hide Fight

177,knoxfan2008,"Funny bad at times, though mostly just cringe",2,19 January 2021,"There is so much wrong with this film, that fully exploring its failures would take a small book. But here's just a few of the most glaring issues1. It's a movie about teens that is so out of touch, that it's incredibly obvious that it was written by a clueless 50 year old who doesn't know how kids act2. The acting was appalling by everyone except Tom Jane, Radha Mitchell and the lead actress. The line reads are awkward and unnatural, plus the trash editing does all the actors a disservice by constantly undermine their dialogue and actions through unintentionally funny cuts. Shout out to the villain and his paranoid sidekick for being the most embarrassing actors.3. The sound editing was distracting and inept. There are so many public domain, stock sound effects in this film that you'd usually hear in goofy comedies like Always Sunny, or the Eric Andre show, yet they use them in a school shooting movie which ends up being hysterical (my personal favourite is the goofy ""crowd gasp"" sound effect around the 43 min mark when the backpack bomb goes off). Also, there is plenty of obvious dubbing and poor ADR.4. My biggest issue was the complete failure of the script to make the film realistic in any way. There are so many continuity errors and plot contrivances that I can't get into, but the worst part is how none of these people act like actual people. A car crashes into a building and people are shot, yet not a single kid calls the police, texts their friends, or even has their phones out UNTIL the bad guy asks them to livestream. Also, while guns and crashes are going on, somehow the other classes are all in session, going about like normal, half an hour AFTER the shooting begins. They apparently didn't hear anything and none of the students have received texts from their friends, and even though one of the students had over 1,000 viewers on his livestream on the school's own social media page, none of the school kids or teachers are shown watching it in other classes. Who the hell is watching this school livestream if none of the students or teachers or even parents are? This director doesn't know how simple technology works, or people for that matter. Students are covered in blood and telling people there's a shooting, and teachers are like ""pfft go away from my class you ruffians!"". Also, if a fire alarm goes off and stops when your half way out the school, pretty sure the protocol is to follow through to outside, because the system could have failed due to the potential fire or electrical issues. This stuff is so basic but there's zero internal logic and all the characters are dummies.5. Some of the best cringe came from lines like ""huh, so you didn't want to get your hands dirty?"" after the main character finds hand sanitiser on one of the killers. Another favourite was the bible girl answering ""free will"" to the shooter's question ""why is god allowing this to happen"", but the editing is so bad, it's straight up like the infamous ""for you"" editing in TDKR. hilarious. My favourite was the corny line from the lead's mum ""someone is still holding on"", this movie would have been mocked for lacking all subtlety 40 years ago.6. On the villain, it's a clear rip-off of Die Hard, but the main bad guy is so irritating and cringe that I had to actively take breaks from the film. The smug acting was unbearable, his character was as if Hans Gruber and the villain from The Purge had a baby, but it was stomped on relentlessly as a baby. He turned this film from laughably bad, to just plain cringe whenever he or his lackeys were talking.There's so much more about this film that fails, including basics like lighting and cinematography (plus I didn't even talk about the flamboyantly gay male teacher who screams like a girl, because again, written by an out of touch boomer who hasn't seen a film since the 80's apparently). There are so many more things wrong with this film but i'll end it there before I end up writing all night. This film fails in all the ways movies like ""Elephant"" or ""Polytechnique"" succeed, because in those films, people act like actual people and not lame hallmark tv charactersDon't spend any money on this film, and don't watch it unless you wanna get friends together to laugh at it.2/10",Run Hide Fight

187,Yarayaraman,RUN HIDE FIGHT THINK,9,17 August 2021,"There is something desperately worrying about the disconnect between the ""critics"" and reality. Critics have hated on films for decades that have gone on to critical acclaim, or at least notorious status. The acting is strong, the narrative is well presented, and while it's far from unpredictable, it is a tense and engaging ride. The critics views are probably the most interesting aspect of our current society that this film exposes. It appears that no mainstream critic is prepared to accept that this is a good film (which it is), for whatever reason.Yes, on one level, this is an exploitation film. In other words, it's entertaining. The critics seem so overwhelmed by the tastelessness of the central premise, that they cannot see any of the other messages. If this was a Korean movie, it would probably be hailed as a masterpiece, unpacking the political and social ills of Korean society. Because it is an American movie, about a very raw American problem, they are unable, or unwilling to accept that on many levels, this is saying something important. The villains are not glamourised or given a single redeeming feature (except one, that redeems himself), so why the hate? Because, and I would argue, only because, it is a well structured morally ambiguous film, that doesn't attempt to define absolutely what is right or wrong.If you are easily triggered or your definition of right and wrong are so starkly and unequivocally defined that you cannot look a little deeper, avoid.If you want to watch an unflinching and engaging action film that manages to ask some difficult questions, without judgement, watch.",Run Hide Fight

You can't honestly expect John McTiernan-caliber Die Hard action and Oscar-level performance from a movie that features high school kids (of course there is cheesy, awkward, and clichéd dialogue). Don't get me wrong, the actors (especially the lead protagonist) do a fantastic job of portraying trauma and giving you an inside look into real-life situations such as Columbine. Third, this is Daily Wire's first attempt at movie-making so I didn't get a vibe they were going for a cinematic home run.As many other reviewers have pointed out, politics was not a theme in this movie. However, I found it interesting they mentioned several issues such as bullying and how law enforcement protocol can be easily exploited. Just like in Columbine, law enforcement spent too much time waiting outside before going in and it was odd there wasn't more effort to communicate between students, parents, & law enforcement about the situation (e.g. How many shooters, what types of weapons they're using, location, etc.) considering the abundant use of smartphones today.Overall, this was a good movie that makes you think about life, how we treat each other, and the importance of communication between children, parents, and teachers.",Run Hide Fight

I will just talk about the movie.This is definitely worth watching. But, it is not for those faint of heart. It does show a graphic, visceral and very real view of violence. And that is it's saving grace. This is not ""Die Hard"" (1988) or ""The Expendables"" (2010). All the characters in this film are human. They feel pain, get scared, have flaws, and yes...even die. You can ALMOST turn off your sense of disbelief while watching this, but that only adds weight to the atrocities contained within.This is best displayed by the protagonist Zoe Hull, played by Isobel May. She is an angsty teen girl dealing with the death of her mother to cancer, raised by her ex-military sniper father, facing the waning days of her senior high school year. She is thrust into a shooting/hostage situation and uses her wits and cunning to save not just herself but her entire school. She is not a Kung-Fu expert or super ninja. She is simply an ordinary person put into an extraordinary situation.

Happened at a college next to her preschool. It was HORRIFYING.Glorifying a school shooting by making a movie about one like this is repugnant. Both in the way it depicts the shooter and the supposed ""good guy/gal with a gun.""

You use it, or lose it. Law enforcement, who train and practice a lot more than the average gun owner/carrier, MISS their target as average of 80% of the time!

208,LivingWitness,It's just bad,2,20 April 2021,"Run Hide Fight feels like the kind of movie that was based on a first or second draft of a script. You can see what they were trying to get at with a lot of the character beats, but it lacks some of the subtlety that you'd see in a more refined script. A lot of it is on the nose stuff that relies on things being told explicitly through dialogue rather than relying on the actors' acting their emotions, essentially.Most of the action scenes were passable but not great. If this was the kind of movie that was released straight to YouTube instead of being hidden behind a paywall, they probably would have seemed a lot better. As it stands, the action scenes seemed really lacking, especially when you compare them to the action scenes in other recent action movies like the John Wick trilogy, the Kingsman movies, and Atomic Blonde.A lot of the naysayers about this movie have tended to criticise it as being in bad taste. It is true that a school shooting movie is in bad taste, but I think you can say that about a lot of action/thriller movies' subject matter. Movies about serial killers, stalkers, or violent predators are all in bad taste, but you can still make a good movie about them if you know how to handle the subject matter well.Run Hide Fight isn't a movie that handles the subject matter well. I think it would have benefited from not being based so heavily on Columbine, but rather just being a fictional shooting. Most of the best movies in this post-Columbine genre have done just that. Home Room (2003) and Bang Bang You're Dead (2002) both had social commentary on the school shooting epidemic and were obviously inspired by Columbine, but the events in those films were far enough removed from the real events of April 20th, 1999 that you could consider the events of the film in their own context.It's much harder to do that with Run Hide Fight. So much of what happens in the movie is so directly inspired by the massacre that you have to consider the events of that day when considering the merits of this movie. If you're someone who's particularly familiar with the events of that day, you're going to be bothered by the inaccuracies portrayed in the scenes in Run Hide Fight that were directly inspired by the Columbine massacre.I think that's ultimately the biggest problem with Run Hide Fight. The writing, action, and acting was never really good enough to hold the weight of the commentary the movie was trying to make. Even though I think it's important that we as a culture get to a point where it's socially acceptable to do movies about school shootings, even if the message of those movies are ultimately ones I disagree with, I think this movie is a bad example of how to do that.",Run Hide Fight

As an action movie, it was okay. It was, at best, mediocre. It brings nothing new to the table. The only real critique I have (other than the blatant propoganda) is the horrible script. It was amateurish at best. The students' dialogues were a bit stilted and unnatural, but again, due to the genre of the film, it didn't really detract that much away from it. This is an action flick, after all.
The other issue I had was with some of the plot elements. The ending was laughably unrealistic, implausible, and honestly seemed to have been shoehorned in as an after-thought.
Now the elephant in the room. Yes, this is a propoganda film, and what lessons does it teach you?
1: The only way to stop a school massacre is to arm the school security guard.
2: School shooters are either mentally ill, victims of bullyling, or starving for noteriety.
3: The only solution to gun violence and mass shootings is to ensure that the 'good guys' have unfettered access to guns.All in all, it was more 'meh' for me. Yes, it's watcheable, the production quality was decent. The lead actress did a decent job (wish I could say the same for the rest)... but that's about it.
I know this was a work of propoganda, and despite the fact that I think it's sending out a very dangerous message, I rated this solely on the quality of the film. If I had to give it a rating based on the message it's trying to convey, I'd have given it a 1.",Run Hide Fight

255,Ghostrunner66,Solid American Action Flick.,8,17 January 2021,"Not going to say that this was anything Oscar worthy, or ""truly amazing"" but Isabel May is solid as Zoe, All-American outsider high school kid who takes control in a bad situation. Finding herself faced with a active shooter-hostage scenario at her school, Zoe uses tactical skills, wits and her survival instinct, instilled by her ex-military father, played by Thomas Jane, to become a reluctant hero. She uses these skills to turn the tide, save lives and out smart the sociopathic, Tristan (played by Eli Brown to villainous perfection I might add) and his fellow marauders. While this movie is not as good at looking in a more in-depth way from the student aspect as Gus Van Sant's 2003 Elephant did, it does ponder somewhat, from the student's stand-point, meaning behind their horrific actions (i.e. Zoe's interaction with Kip, also a small shout out for Cyrus Arnold). I know critics have and will tear the movie to sheds mainly because its produced by The Daily Wire. Yes, Ben Shapiro's Daily Wire. Heaven forbid. Here's the thing though intrepid reader: It was entertaining, and it didn't have to ret-con any old classic characters, and it didn't have to brow beat you with identity or woke politics.

263,bsalco,Good but not Great,7,15 January 2021,"So I have read a lot of praise and seen quite a few 10/10 in here for this film. Being a teacher and member of of my school's crisis committee, I had some problems with the way teachers, school security guards and the police are portrayed in this movie. I found myself cringing at times with how events played out throughout the movie.Now if this movie was taking place in the early to mid-90s before Columbine or any of the other major school shootings occurred I could maybe have found this believable. But to see a school and police force be so clueless how to react in this today's world was a bit absurd.I know this appears to be a remote rural town, but I have a hard time believing that the school and police would not have had better training to prepare for this. Teachers reading a manual in the middle of the crisis telling them what to do? The school security guard urinating himself and running away to change his clothes? Law enforcement not having a clue with how to enter the school to take down the shooter(s)? And leaving a high-powered rifle out in the open for anyone to pick up? I also find it hard to believe that a school allows these ""senior pranks"" that are apparently repeated from year to year. I mean really...a giant slip n slide down a sloped hallway?My school, like just about every other school in the country, has lockdown drills 2 times per year. Local police are a part of those drills and have all been well-versed on what to do if an active shooter were to enter our building. To see Larkins view on school personnel and law enforcement was disheartening and made this movie unbelievable to me at times.However, I do think the content of this movie is important and sadly, relevant in today's society. It is important for people to remember that violence in schools is real. We've seen it too many times. Once I put the ridiculousness mentioned above aside, I appreciated the movie for what it was supposed to be. I also liked that Larkin put the focus on the heroine rather than the youthful terrorists.This movie has enough substance and validity to make it worth the watch.

The lead villain was fun to watch as well. His comedic demeanor over the shooting brought a nice complexity to the situation.There's a few preposterous moments like the ending but it's a movie so it is what it is.Reasons why critics might trash this movie even though it's good:1. It's a sensitive subject since hundreds of students have been killed in mass shootings.2. The villains are all white. Which makes them ""white supremacists"" in the eyes of woke liberal critics.3. The film criticizes the negative effects that social media has on society, which is an attack on the vast institutional and cultural power of social media, power that liberals and Democrats want to protect.4. There's a few ""offensive"" moments like when the villain objectifies a female teacher.These are ridiculous reasons why critics should trash a movie. Art is a metaphor for life. If school shootings are a real life occurrence, then they can be portrayed fictionally.On a side note, I saw this movie because I'm a fan of Ben Shapiro and The Daily Wire. I applaud their effort in taking a risk on distributing a film like this. Hollywood needs more conservative voices in their culture.I rated this movie a 10/10 to help offset the negative reviews from critics. But on my own personal scale, I'd say it's a B-",Run Hide Fight

It does not set out to prove or relay an agenda. This movie is a story of courage in the face of psychological trauma. It's not Citizen Kane, but it's a solid watch with good editing, good acting and a solid art direction. The trailer gave off heavy Die Hard vibes but the movie itself is nothing like it.Critics won't like it because it provides virtually no political commentary and places all of its value on the importance of courage and doesn't focus on the broader issues at play besides the ubiquitous issue of self-obsession and social media infamy. Conservatives would like it more if they had touched on the issue of nihilism, but again, this movie isn't for the right or the left, it's for everyone.In recent years, professional critics are most often concerned with the message they want to see, often using phrases such as ""this movie provides social commentary which will undoubtedly make the audience think"" rather than immersing themselves in the story the movie wants to tell. Comparable to the ""problem"" with ""Hillbilly Elegy"", which sets out to tell a story and does it well. Critics don't like it because they don't like the overall message.

This movie starring Thomas Jane and Isabel May tells a tale of a father and daughter who recently experienced a loss and how they deal with it, and then Zoe, a seventeen year old who has put herself in a box to protect herself from more trauma is faced with a choice: Run, Hide or Fight.This movie takes all the victimhood out of a dangerous and very sensitive issue and asks the question. What if? What if a girl, raised by a strong, supportive father and a loving mother decides to help people in a deadly situation. This movie received harsh criticism from many critics, but their political bias smells terrible. These same people were perfectly fine with movies depicting things a hundred times worse. This movie is good, and you leave feeling not so helpless. Isn't that how we all want to feel?Zoe was incredible. Isabel portrayed her so well, her facial expressions, her snarls, etc. were excellent, depicting the embodiment of rage. Thomas Jane was great as well.I did have a couple of issues with one scene that felt out of character, making Zoe seem inhuman and unhinged, but what movie is without missteps? The end, where Zoe's dad did a little something to help her, it seemed a little over the top. This is an action flick, though, so over the top should be expected.

They asked questions people didn't necessarily want to hear, and they didn't apologize for it.Now hollywood is a joke. They're nothing more than a political mouthpiece for stuffy elitists who want to signal their many ""virtues"" to as many people as possible. Entertaining and thought provoking content has long ago been moved to the back burner.Run Hide Fight is like Hollywood kryptonite.For the first time in a LONG time, we have a female protagonist with a... Dare I say it? ACTUAL CHARACTER ARC. Guess what ladies and gentlemen? She is FLAWED! Goodness me, say it isn't so! A FLAWED FEMALE CHARACTER??? No such thing!Seems unbelievable, but no, she actually grows by the end of her experience. I won't go into spoilers, but through the movie she deals with loss and the feelings that come with it. She struggles to make dangerous, selfless decisions and doesn't always know what the right thing to do is.Regardless of any of that, she's a tough, scary, badtothebone protagonist. you'll see that 30 seconds into the movie.She's not the only remarkable character. The antagonist is genuinely unhinged and terrifying, but not at all mindless. He's remarkably and chillingly clever, outsmarting the system without much effort at all. You can actually watch him continue manipulate his minions in real time, playing on their insecurities and even exploiting the mental disorder of one of them. They're not the typical endlessly loyal, mindless drones that Hollywood antagonists employ.As you can clearly see, I'm not good at giving reviews. I also don't know how to end one, so I'll leave you with this.Run Hide Fight is an incredible, thought provoking action movie that delivers on all fronts.

And any issues with the production of the movie or the production company (I am completely aware of the issues with Cinestate. But I don't believe that means this movie should be shunned and buried.)The acting is pretty good. The production is very well made.What bothered me most were the convoluted plot points to keep the police away from the school during the shooting/siege. (not really spoilers, these happen in like the first 10-15 minutes of the movie) A field fire? A shed fire? Are those really going to get all the police and emergency response teams in the county to respond to those? And block roads because on lookers want to see what's going on?I've lived in rural places before. A field fire isn't going to get that many people to block roads to watch it. And we know early on one of the student's mothers called the police. But they couldn't tear themselves away from a field fire or a shed fire to respond to a school shooting.Weak plot points like this really ruin movies like this for me. If the kid had planted bombs at the court house or other important buildings in town, then we may have had a more believable plot point. But I am fairly confident they'd just let the shed burn to the ground if student lives were at risk, and a single engine fire response could have taken care of the field fire.Still, a pretty decent movie. But certainly not the strongest from Cinestate. And certainly not going to put Daily Wire on the streaming map, but it's a decent first step for them, I suppose.",Run Hide Fight

The actors' portrayals are astounding, especially as new actors I haven't personally seen before. The raw emotion from Zoe's character is amazing. The villains were really good at their role as well, especially Tristan's character. It should be noted this movie is very gruesome, but very well done. What surprised me the most was how emotionally driven this movie is. It is not some cold-hearted action movie, like some may have described. Anything Zoe does has purpose and you can tell she does everything with a heavy heart. Not only that, she tries to connect with others. She exemplifies compassion and bravery.This movie is a great example of young female empowerment. Something most people should be rooting for. She is not some ""weak"" female actor like I've seen many times. Zoe's character is without a doubt very strong. I don't think me or anyone I know would be nearly as brave as her. (I know it's a movie, but still) I can't give enough credit to all of the actors. None of the writing felt forced or cheesy.

I mean, subtlety people, subtlety, Don't be like those cringe religious movies where the writers' interpretations of evens overpower the actual storytelling, instead of letting the audience reach their own conclusion.Acting was decent, not stellar but OK, mediocre directing and the screenwriting bordered on b-movie levels.The antagonist's motivations are nonexistent, making the suspension of disbelief harder every time he's on screen.Also, the last scene had some pretty horrible messaging in my opinion. At this stage in time, why would anyone not just inform the police, rather than go alone on a manhunt? Is the movie advocating for self-judgment and pass it as heroism?

332,b_um_p,Surprisingly decent action,8,18 February 2021,"Critic reviews will prattle on about the lack of psychological depth - which is strange because critics rarely feel the need to point out deeper psychological meaning in the latest Marvel or Terminator films. They'll describe it pejoratively as Die Hard in a school, as if the very nature of this premise makes it a terrible idea. They believe that any real life tragedy renders narratives with similar concepts completely off limits. Fear not, simpletons! Our cultural elites will exert their influence to police what stories are allowed to be told, and protect our feeble minds from feeling... anything. Reviewers are tiresome, fearful of their peers, and remain completely out of touch with moviegoing audiences.
Run Hide Fight is Die Hard in a school, and it's glorious. We've all witnessed tragic school shootings splayed across our news feeds. We've wept seeing the terrible loss of life, and boiled with rage over the incompetence of the agencies meant to protect us. It isn't necessary to wallow in our collective misery for another hour and forty nine minutes. It's time for a different story. A story where the villains fail. Where a hero rises. Where a courageous young woman can be believably resilient for a change.
This is an action film. This is good versus evil. This has characters making inspiring, selfless choices. It features surprisingly strong performances, engages throughout, and wears its Die Hard similarities proudly.
No, Run Hide Fight is not the film critics want it to be. And we are all the better for it.",Run Hide Fight

337,jstanley-99134,Solid Action Movie,9,14 February 2021,"RUN HIDE FIGHT is a solid action film: DIE HARD in a Midwestern high school. The setting alone sets it apart from today's formulaic, run-of-the-mill action flicks, and that is important in keeping the genre fresh and interesting. The lack of over-the-top effects and music is appreciated, proving true the old adage ""Less is More."" It has great pacing, with a steady building of tension and suspense producing the inevitable action which in turn leads to a satisfying conclusion.Thomas Jane's small role as the veteran father is a great treat for action flick aficionados fond of his cult hit THE PUNISHER. But the truly great performance of this film is Isabel May. Hers is one of the best heroine depictions in recent memory. She and the film don't give an implausible Mary Sue protagonist, nor do they beat the viewer over the head with an ""I am Woman, hear me roar"" emphasis on the fact that a female can be heroic. They instead opt for a natural heroine to carry the natural storytelling along, and that is as refreshing as the uniqueness of the setting.Politics are unavoidable in seeing this, given the sensitive subject matter, but it is good that the film has the courage simply to touch it. To reiterate, it is important for a film to address it and use it as a setting simply to keep the action genre as a whole fresh and moving forward. There should also be films that speak to our reality just as there are those indulging in fantasy. Arguably the best reason for this film touching school shootings is that it takes away the power of such incidents and encourages us to wield it ourselves: rather than be frightened, saddened, or angered beyond reason by such brutal realities, we are reminded that our responses to tragedies are far more important than the tragedies themselves.What robs RUN HIDE FIGHT from a perfect rating? There is some mediocre to bad acting from background characters. There are also some implausible moments, particularly with regards to first responders and the lack of noise and penetrating power of firearms. A bit of comic relief would also have been useful to cut the tension. Still, these are minor quibbles and are easily forgiven when remembering that this is an action film, which by nature has some bad acting and implausibility; and by remembering how sensitive this subject matter is, and that incorporating comic relief in any way would threaten the integrity of the film's theme and tone.Bottom Line: It's a great action film well worth watching on your night off, and like any good action movie, it leaves you pumped and motivated to deal with the next barrage of evils life throws your way.",Run Hide Fight

344,makruczynski,Mediocre and I don't know who this movie is for,4,8 February 2021,"There's nothing particularly appealing about this movie. The protagonist isn't memorable, clever or even very likeable. The way she fights the bad guys isn't anything worth remembering. There's nothing that really stands out in this movie, except the ending.
You know how in all those old action movies the bad guy pulls up a gun at the end and the hero is forced to kill them? Well, in Run Hide Fight the protagonist sees the bad guy get away and instead of telling the police who are right next to her, she grabs a sniper rifle (that police left in a public area) follows the guy into the woods, shoots him then gloats for few minutes and leaves the guy to die. The hero of the movie straight up murders the bad guy in an act of vengeance. I don't mind morally grey characters but this wasn't the place for it, especially since the main character isn't likeable already.
Which brings me to the second point. I don't know who is this for. The protagonist is a girl with some kind of psychological trauma after losing her mother, she's mean to everyone, shuts off emotionally, isn't funny or has no noble goals, she's ""not like the other girls"" girl (she literally kills a deer with a rock to the head), and she talks with a hallucination of her dead mother. If you are a young dude who wants a power fantasy about stopping a school shooting, you know like we imagine on boring lessons, you are not going to put yourself in her shoes. If you are a girl, then you probably don't find yourself too similar to her either. Honestly with the amount of screentime and how much preaching the main antagonist did, I sometimes felt like he's the point of view, at least for the director.
Some bizarre decisions were made during the production of this movie and nothing impressive came out at the end.",Run Hide Fight

350,mvmlego,A High-Quality Production,8,15 January 2021,"I usually try to avoid lengthy reviews, but given the circumstances of the movie's development, and the enormous gap between the critic score and general score, I think a lengthy review is warranted.The production value was excellent, and the acting is top-notch. As even the harshest critics have noted, Isabel May (the lead) delivered a fantastic performance. Nearly all of the other actors were great as well, with the man who played her father being the only one that I wouldn't describe as anything better than mediocre.The characters were written well, including most of the shooters, and the movie does an above-average job of depicting the attitudes, speech patterns, etc. of real high-schoolers.Now to address the points by critics and skeptical potential viewers:1) This film is not exploitative. It's not exploiting school shootings any more than Hotel Rwanda is exploiting genocide. The film isn't shot or edited in such a way that revels in the suffering of the victims--unlike, for example, most horror movies.It avoids cheap cinematic tricks such as the jump scares of horror movies and the frenetic cuts and bombastic music of faction movies. Instead, the film relies on the inherent weightiness of the situation in order to deliver the emotional impact. (On that note, this movie is *not* a ""fun"" watch, contrary to one popular review.)2) The film is not conservative propaganda. Yes, the protagonist uses a gun to try to save the day. That doesn't make it pro-gun propaganda, though. By the same standard, the film would be anti-gun propaganda on the basis that it depicts guns being used to kill innocent people.The movie also doesn't try to lay the blame for the incident on any particular person or group. It shows adults making a lot of relatively innocent mistakes that compound to make the situation worse, but those mistakes have little to do with politics. There was one line of dialogue that felt like the writers were taking a cheap shot at the press, but that's it.(As an aside, I do like the way that the adults were written. Most of them are doing their best to alleviate the situation--they just aren't presented with the same opportunities as Zoe to do so, or they lack the requisite skills.)3) Will this movie inspire copycat crimes? That's difficult to say. Three of four shooters are nihilistic and depicted in such a completely unflattering way that I can't imagine anyone trying to emulate them.The fourth, who happens to be the leader of the group, would come off as remarkably charismatic if he was doing pretty much anything other than killing a bunch of innocent teens. He also looks like he's having a good time, at least initially.------------So, if the production values are excellent, and most of the criticisms of the movie aren't sound, why am I only giving this a 7? There are a few reasons.At several points, Zoe converses with her dead mother, who gives her advice ranging from emotional counseling to survival strategies. It felt a little like a deus ex machina, and it disrupted to mood of the movie.My other main point of criticism comes from the handling of the lead shooter. Even though he was an interesting character, I think that he's a little to relatable to teens who see themselves as edgy.Altogether, I think this movie lands squarely between a 7 and an 8, but I'm giving it a 7 to balance out the current score (8.3). In all, this is quite a good movie, and it's definitely no Pure Flix film. I recommend it for anyone who's not faint of heart.",Run Hide Fight

Eli Brown as the villain is also excellent and believable, there are moments of murder, death, kill but also periods of dark humour which balance the subject matter well.All in all it's a; intelligent film of a contemporary subject that doesn't romanticise or avoid the dark subject of school shootings in America, but does perhaps give you a glimpse of why some of these tragedies can happen without glamorising or trivialising the subjectI enjoyed it so much I watched it twice.",Run Hide Fight

Movie critics can blow all the hot air they want....nobody cares about you pitiful weak bias opinions. This was an excellent movie with some serious truths about how kids control the narratives about their peers starting as early as elementary school leaving them cursed forever as they develop into adults. They didn't even get into the damage social media does to these children because that part is infinitely worse.The lead actress was amazing !! I've never seen her before but she has some fantastic acting chops and can't wait to see where her career takes her. Actually the whole case was pretty flawless and you were riveted to your seat the whole movie. This was like Die Hard but in a high school. It's sad to not be shocked at the storyline but school shootings are unfortunately too common. It was great strong female character and she absolutely nailed it. Go see this movie it's an edge of your seat nail biter for the win !",Run Hide Fight
388,tuxedocatsrok,An overall great watch!,9,16 January 2021,"I would normally find this type of movie unattractive. Generally a hollywood movie about a school shooting is going to be riddled with leftist views, but since this was a Daily Wire product, I gave it a watch, and made the whole family sit through it. One scene that I found pleasant is a scene I see often in movies. The bad guy says why would God allow you to go through this? And the victim is never allowed to answer. Super frustrating for myself to see as I always felt it was another jab at believers and what I am. The girl in this movie answered perfectly. There are many reactions that just aren't what you'd expect to see. I could feel myself getting ready to roll my eyes at what a ""normal"" movie would insert next, but was always content to hear just another line in the movie. Not a single jab at me as a conservative. It sucks how used to that I have become.
Even though some might have seen the cops portrayed as useless, I felt they were instead portrayed as frustrated and sincere. The legal hoops they have to jump through are not something generally pointed out in action films. I certainly look forward to the Daily Wire's next film.
I always knew and could recognize the sprinkled leftist views in regular hollywood movies, but I never thought I'd see a movie like this. Great acting, well done suspense and action, and the overall justice make this movie a must watch. Great job guys!",Run Hide Fight

There's been a lot of high school themed killing movies both from the states and Asia. Usually they're more focused on the gore and how cool and strangely invincible the hero characters are. THIS IS NOT ONE OF THOSE MOVIESThey have a great cast and the writing is believable. Even the villains are believable. I knew people just like the villains back when I graduated in the 90's. The role play is spot on.What I really enjoyed about this movie is it captures how poorly a school that tries hard to do things by the book can still mess up a lockdown and evacuation. No plan is ever perfect, let alone perfectly executed. That alone provides the writers a playground to play this movie out believably.If you like Die Hard, and having a character that gets hurts instead of coming out unscathed, I highly recommend this movie.",Run Hide Fight

The notion that the rest of the school and the world took so long to find out that the cafeteria was under siege was very hard to fathom, even in a flick such as this.

The movie knows this well and sets its tone accordingly; never glorifying kills nor lightening it up to let the audience breathe a little. Under the dark set-piece are messages for the audience about how today's bureaucratic regulations on crisis situations don't cut it, media's love affair with tragedy promotes more tragedy, the value of life and who or what judges that value. Sometimes they hit their intended mark with these messages, sometimes not, and towards the end the movie forgets the grounding in reality in favor of action movie tropes for our heroine but thankfully never feeling distasteful.Technical Rating 2.5/5
Directing: 1Everything comes together well even without the best tools. There's definitely a vision and a purpose behind the camera.
Screenplay: .5Dialogue is surprisingly well written for teenagers (a rarity) but unfortunate cliches and a loss of focus in the end bring it down

On the one hand it is your typical thoughtless action movie fare. I don't think there are any particular innovations here. That said, I knew that's what I'd be watching.The good: it's better than a made for TV movie and mostly watchable. You can talk about it with all your Republican friends. Probably one of the most realistic portrayals of most modern police forces I've ever seen-from the 35 minute response time to letting a 18 year old girl with visible injuries slip away from the apparent incident commander to acquire and use a high-powered rifle marked as evidence to lung shot the primary (also 18 year old) suspect who was going to successfully escape. The only way it could have been more realistic is if they had shot the sidekick/love interest guy for napping while black when he was passed out on the couch from a minor shotgun graze that didn't even seem to tear his clothes much...The bad: all the moments you have to ignore how contrived what you're watching is. From the sheriff and his colleague ""stuck"" in traffic in a truck well equipped for off road use inching down the middle of the road to the staff so detached from reality that they some how completely miss multiple gunshots and a vehicle crashing into the school at a high rate of speed and slamming into parts of the structure there are plenty to choose from.Provided you don't want to operate your brain while you watch, this is a great film.

Even the main character, IN THE CAFETERIA BATHROOM doesn't hear these gun shots because apparently the hand dryer blower thing is so loud she can't hear these insanely loud gun shots over it? gtfo.

They should have died out with newspapers.",Run Hide Fight
452,el_guachin_de_las_pizzitas,Trigger Warning,1,2 February 2021,"It sure is real weird that this got a bunch of 10's right when it first premiered exclusively in screenings hosted by a certain talk show (that I'm not going to name) or that those reviews insist on how ""CRITICS ARE NOT GOING TO LIKE IT"", ""IT'S JUST ENTERTAINMENT WITH SIMPLE THEMES"", ""IT'S APOLITICAL"" or that certain media personalities (all casually with nearly identical political alignments) came out coordinately to publicly praise it. Anyways, I did actually watch it so here's what I have to say.Although the base material is transparently ripped off from Die Hard and other popular action movies the director does a competent job at making it look at least legit. Other than that the characters are flat and devoid of any kind of unique personality, the interactions and dialogues are empty, the villain is a discount TDK Joker, only the protagonist has some kind of development throughout the thing with a very questionable conclusion. The issue with this is that it's also what makes everything else suffer: you care less about the characters so the action loses a lot of weight. You'd think it'd be difficult not to care that highschoolers are being murdered but as the shooters first roll in with their van they run over a couple of kids and you barely notice. Throughout the movie victims get such a poor treatment when they're killed it almost gets to be funny. It struggles to be entertaining.As for its themes, I see a lot of the defenders of this movie are insisting that it's ""apolitical"" since it focuses on broader themes such as courage or heroism. I'm saddened to inform them there's no such thing as apolitical media since politics are based on worldview and stories need to be relevant to their context to resonate to a public. Sure, the movie touches on those themes but it's also about intervention: the villain claims that had the school security been armed they would've easily been able to stop them so later on a single hero takes it upon themselves to stop them after the assault has started. The people who watch it currently live in a society with an epidemic of school shootings where the conservative side agrees that things must remain the way they are so the shootings need to be mitigated instead of prevented. It's a conservative story. That's how it resonates culturally to its audience. It's not even subtle about it: the villain gives a whole bunch of reasons as to why he's there (partly because right-wingers are not very good at making art but they also aren't very good at consuming it so media aimed at them will typically be a little bit more chewed up than usual)A thing to remember: when someone says stuff like ""critics won't like it because it doesn't align to their views"" it's just code for their lack of art literacy. Art is a form of human communication and it goes beyond words or a message. It's a product of its context and will lean towards certain sentiments which might or might not be reprehensible and which is fully valid to criticize. A movie's politics are a part of it.This isn't dumb fun, as some claim it to be. John Wick is dumb fun. The Fast and the Furious is dumb fun. This is a statement hidden behind the facade of an improvised action movie. Its conclusion is the same old ""guns don't kill people, people kill people, we need more guns"" nonsense. It never stops to ponder that maybe there's a huge structural issue with the culture of a country when such a big budget is allocated to a movie that trivializes and creates spectacle out of the recurring massacres of children. It's a tasteless load of trash.",Run Hide Fight

Each villain had their ""reason"" showed. I thought Cyrus (the incel kid, Kip) did a fantastic job acting. It humanized him, while giving him zero justification for his actions. Well done.Another unique part is the injuries taken throughout the movie actually bother and hinder her all the way through.

I must admit, I thought the movie was going to be more preachy and farther to the right than I was comfortable with, but no, it didn't feel like that at all. The fact that it featured a strong heroine who didn't need to remind us that she was a woman all of the time was great. What a great actress she is. The fact that she had an African American soon to be boyfriend, and it was a great relationship in which race didn't matter, was awesome. I thought the young actors in this film were awesome, the dialogue and interactions were more real than most of the high school dribble Hollywood releases. The only criticism I have of the film is that I just didn't think the reactions to some of the events were realistic. If somebody drives a van and crashes into the cafeteria, I think that would be enough for the entire school to very quickly know something was up. I'm still not sure what the evil high school girl was doing in the roof in the bathroom scene. If gun shots go off, I think there would be more of a reaction. I appreciate that DW had some excellent school safety experts involved in the film who know a hell of a lot more than I do, and I think the film showed some of the holes in school security plans, but I just didn't feel the events cause realistic reactions. So much better than Wonder Woman 1984. Looking forward to what DW has next.",Run Hide Fight

I would also have liked to have seen more of the students standing up for themselves in the face of danger instead of just one person.

473,Metahelix,"A well-paced, tightly edited, well-acted, action / thriller...",8,26 January 2021,"...with unexpectedly high production values, a surprisingly coherent story, and an emotional core. To be honest, my expectations weren't high; but, I dutifully watched the live screening of this film in order to support alternative media as a bulwark against the creatively bankrupt, politically correct, derivative, nihilistic, agenda / narrative-driven tripe produced by Hollywood these days. However, after the first 15 minutes I was hooked due to the expert build-up of tension, foreboding and suspense. Tonally, I was getting a distinct late 90s / early 00s dark TV miniseries vibe. Really superb, standout acting performances that elevated the movie from being just standard fare came courtesy of the lead actress Isabel May (Zoe Hull) and one of the high school shooters, Cyrus Arnold (Kip Quade). The mother, Radha Mitchell (Jennifer Hull), provided a mysterious; but, thematically important presence that galvanized and motivated her daughters actions and bravery. It was also great to see Thomas Jane (The Punisher) play the suffering; but, involved and proud father. The script was plausible, played straight, didn't contain any glaring plot holes and was neatly structured into three acts as per the title: (1) running; (2) hiding; (3) fighting. But, it is not to say the movie didn't have any faults. In particular, the opening scene came across as trying too hard to be edgey and wanting to make a statement that this film is in-your-face different. Also, there was a cringey girl fight where they should've edited out all of the caterwauling : ). As an opening salvo (so to speak) and initial foray into the movie production business, The Daily Wire has set a decent bar and standard to build upon for the future.

Oh wow, I LOVE a gritty, realistic action film with depth, and...people, THIS IS IT! And I can't stand being distracted by even one poor actor. EVERY actor in this was superb. I had heard of none of them except Treat Williams, of course, but the caliber of performances was out of this world. I'm not even much of a fan of Treat Williams, but I thought he was perfect in this role, as was each actor casted perfectly. I won't say more in order not to chance a spoiler. I'll just offer a warning that the violence in this is realistic. I would not watch with a child anywhere near. Even I, as a mid-life adult who loves realism, squinted my eyes when I thought a violent act may be coming and I was glad I did. Not gory violence, simply realistic. I DO recommend high school teens (or maybe even middle school if they are mature enough & have a parent present to discuss) watch it to improve their mindset on this topic. Also, I recommend watching the 15 minute video about the making of the movie. It made me appreciate even more how this movie differs from other movies on the topic (as I had never watched any that are out, so could not realize it myself) AND appreciate the artistic choices they made for the movie. Truly superb.

479,aindikt,An amazing performance by Isabel May,10,17 January 2021,"There aren't many young actresses or actors today who could pull off the gritty and emotional range that was displayed by Isabel May in this film about a high school shooting scenario and the way the interlocutors react. The heroine is strong yet vulnerable, beset by challenges in her personal life in coping with loss and suddenly confronted with an exogenous threat to herself and those around her.The critics have once again shown that they are so divorced from the mainstream viewership that they can't see a strong female character in a realistic scenario unless she espouses woke language or displays impossible abilities to defy basic physics. The character in this film comes thorough despite these limitations. I saw one critic compared her negatively to the implausible character of Katness Evergreen from The Hunger Games. How completely delusional must someone be and blinded by their personal politics to compare a realistic school shooting scenario to the Hunger Games and have the latter as more 'real'.We see this so often now - the 'critic score' at polar opposite to the 'regular person score' - that one wonders why critics even have a job anymore. Perhaps it is to provide that contra-indicator to know that the low critic score means the film will be good.Although this issue needs to be address, most disappointing is that the lead actress performance is overshadowed by the critics' need to engaged in their woke politics. Why couldn't they credit such a strong performance?Switch off the critics and see this film.

In reality it's a 6 at best.To start off, I have to give huge props to Isabel May ( I spell that right?) because she really is the one that keeps this film together. Great acting on her part. Thomas Kane was decent too but we didn't see enough of him to make a real judgement. The rest of the cast was forgettable in my opinion.Now to the film itself, it is disturbing and I mean that. We see students getting killed left and right in various ways. The ways the school shooters were killed off was immensely satisfying especially that last one. The way the atmosphere descends from an ""okay I think we can get out of this"" to a dimly lit school in flames questioning the fate of each character. This was my favorite part of the film; the atmospheric descent. The dead mother scenes were confusing for the first time around and then the messages start to build around the plot and give us some necessary breathing time before we have to hold our breaths again.Now to the parts I didn't like. Let me say this first I understand that each character had tons of emotions running through their bodies during the film but sometimes they just did the dumbest things especially with May's character. She had numerous times to disarm the shooters especially with the female shooter. Also after the van explosion scene May's character walks past a shotgun on the ground from the previous skirmish. What was she gonna do? My biggest gripe with this film and I can't stress it enough. How the f did no one else hear gunshots throughout the school? Seriously. When I was in high school we were all always on our phones in class so how did one student not have his/her phone out and see what was happening on social media. I would've assumed parents would've been calling their kids once news broke out.In conclusion, it's a thrilling ride through what really hasn't been shown in the entertainment industry thus far so I applaud the balls of Daily Wire for producing this.",Run Hide Fight

507,michaellouthan,New Era in Entertainment,10,24 May 2021,"Run Hide Fight was an ode to Die Hard and the classic American action hero in the context of an immensely relevant and controversial topic. It is the first feature film produced by The Daily Wire, and they absolutely crushed it. The idea of having the protagonist take out the bad guys one by one in a hostage situation is not new. Air Force One and Die hard boast similar scenarios, but never would I have thought it could be so well done by a young production company with conservative vales, while at the same time tackling the problem of school shootings, self-defense, and woman empowerment. It seems unlikely that a small teenage girl could take out a band of attention-starved psychopaths. But why not? The characters were developed to satisfaction and their personal backgrounds matched their abilities. The visuals are professional-grade and so is the acting, cinematography, and directing. There's nothing boring about it either. With such a low budget and an amateur production company I expected another cheap conservative film, but that's not what I got. It was exhilarating throughout. The dialogue and the plot are practical and well written. There's nothing cheesy about it. It's a serious, captivating, educational, and inspiring film. If there's any message that I take after watching it, it's that kids are capable of extraordinary violence and bravery and that self-defense and knowledge of firearms are essential to dismantling those with firearms.",Run Hide Fight

If this is representative of school shootings then why does this school have no actual preemptive measures in place, every American school does.

Some other major plot holes: like how did the dad have a shot on a elevated room from a ground position but yeah, decent action movie but also unrealistic in some places.i have quite a few other criticisms of the film regarding how they portrayed viral videos....old men who nothing about the media platforms and the kinds of guns that school raiders usually have..... so for me 7 out of 10 but actually almost a 6.",Run Hide Fight

You might expect some sub par acting, plot holes, or some bad pacing, instead you get a movie that moves beyond all that and gives you a lot to consider, and will be a big conversation starter. What are schools doing wrong when comes to active shooter situations? Should security have a fire arm? Should teachers have a firearm?
While I find myself questioning the realistically of the film, I think the point is well made. It stunningly takes a tragic story and turns the heroes into the focus rather the monsters. That is something we can all get behind. We need more heroes in this day and age.

I like the struggle she has to do the right thing, then watching her go all in at all costs. I thought the struggle dealing with the loss of a parent was very well portrayed. The power of Thomas Jane to play a low key but pivotal part in the building of our hero, the display of love as a father, and the solid determination of a retired soldier to protect. The mom, I forget her name but not her face, as the growth of Niki in the movie was sublime. The things our parents teach us, even if they have passed. That coffee cup, though?

Just to be clear, I actually support the 2nd amendment as well as hunting, but this movie is filled with more plot holes than all the shots fired, and there's a lot of shooting.We start with father and daughter bonding out in the woods hunting deer. When they hit their mark and realize the deer is still alive, our protagonist brutally smashes its head with a rock. As another reviewer pointed out, this is illegal all over North America. It doesn't get any better from there.We're supposed to be enraged at the school faculty because they made a ridiculous rule that they have to witness the shooters with guns before they can call the police, and they can't hear any of the gunfire, or the van crashing through a wall, and when they finally decide to go make eye contact, they send a security guard with a baton. Every one of these insane plot holes is meant to make us clench our fists at the evil liberal agenda that has prevented us from arming and training every student in the use of firearms, yet we're also supposed to empathize with the poor spree shooters cause somebody was mean to them once.I really loved Thomas Jane in The Expanse, and his acting, as well as most of the cast here, is actually great, but the writing, directing, and hamfisted preaching made this a disappointment.",Run Hide Fight

Me? I enjoyed this film all the way through, and the two main characters, Zoe and her Mom, were absolutely brilliant. The regular appearance of her dead Mom (and her Java breakfast pick-me-up) was actually both grounding and helped lighten the constant tension, rather than weird. Overall, very reminiscent of the first Die Hard film, even down to the experienced old school cop helping her on the outside, great performance by Treat Williams. OK, Zoe didn't pop all 4 of the perps, her Pop popped one, so Zoe needed both parents to get through this one. Nice touches, liking taking off her Dad's green jacket for her wounded boyfriend and then her Mom saying goodbye, demonstrated that she was prepared to get on with her life again. As she said so tellingly, no-one will remember the shooter, but they'll never forget her. Hell of a coming of age movie!

No. But it's a good movie, and it's refreshing to finally have a good movie, with a good story, good production, good script, and good production, that doesn't jam a political agenda or ideology down the viewer's throats. Remember, before around 2010-2015, when movies were movies, and the plot focused on... well... a plot, rather than a surface level plot that instead sought to shove ideas of intersectionaltity, ""down with the patriarchy,"" and making not-so-subtle messages about the evils of certain groups of people? Well, here we are, back to the roots and what makes movies enjoyable. If you're tired of all the Netflix originals shoving an agenda, worldview, and cult-like ideology down your throat, and want to simply watch an entertaining flick that doesn't feel like you're being preached to, than this is for you.

This film was fantastic and much better than the ""critics"" said it would be. My advice would be to just watch it and see for yourself. I think the writers got this one right.
Great to see that the hero was a girl with the heart of a lion(ess) who put the lives of everyone else before her own.",Run Hide Fight
565,ohdoulton,Intense,9,8 March 2021,This is a Very good show that keeps your attention from start to finish. The. Ovie pulls you in from the start presenting enough clues that you want to keep watching to see what happens next. The intensity grows and only releases you at its very end. Good acting and dialog. An original screenplay was refreshing in this age of remakes and franchises.,Run Hide Fight

568,cathyoki-83768,Had to watch it twice,10,16 January 2021,"Last night I watched Run Hide Fight and enjoyed it so much I had to watch it again immediately afterward. The storyline and acting kept me totally engrossed in the movie throughout. Character development was 3-dimensional, it was easy to truly care about the plight of the kids, and glad the instigators didn't get famous by their names being mentioned on TV in the film. See it as soon as you can.",Run Hide Fight
569,mrmatthewchrzanowski,Impressive,10,15 January 2021,"What a powerful story. The storytelling is amazing, and it works. There are no plotholes I could find. The acting is out of this world.

573,figueroabraulio,Kept Me On The Edge Of My Seat,10,16 January 2021,"Best movie I've seen in a long time. None of the actors are well known (at least to me) and all the acting was very good. Was seriously impressed. For someone who has been through this in real life, I can't imagine them watching this movie and it not triggering some PTSD.I've already recommended the movie to 4 other people.",Run Hide Fight

As a teacher and parent I appreciated the accuracy.",Run Hide Fight
575,hrgirl-56607,AMAZING MOVIE! IGNORE THE STUPID CRITICS!,10,5 June 2021,"This movie will keep you on the edge of the seat as well as get you right in the feels! The protagnist is an amazing actress who makes you feel as if you were in her shoes, in the middle of a violent, terrifying situation! This is not a helpless wall flower or a Mary Sue. She is skilled thanks to her father, tough thanks to her personal losses, and the film does an excellent job of showing her healing and character development.The villains aren't just stereotypes either! I've seen some critics say that it was psychologically empty? What movie did they watch?One of the villains was responding to bullying yes, but the others were either mentally ill (a common and real issue facing most school shooters) or driven by the need for fame and attention. This was an amazing plot device, since it made the main villain truly seem threatening and scary.10 out of 10 for the unexpected twists, turns, fantastic acting and amazing effects that made it feel like a multi-million dollar blockbuster!",Run Hide Fight
576,vmares-10189,Good Movie!,7,25 January 2021,"Don't listen to the critics...although I think viewers are already on to them based on the feedback I'm seeing. This was a well-made movie with great acting and a good story. Having courage in the face of evil is a classic value that anyone should get behind regardless of your politics. The action and suspense kept me glued to the screen, I never lost interest or got bored. Even if some of the scenes were a bit far-fetched, this isn't uncommon in your typical Hollywood movie either. I found myself solidly rooting for the protagonist. The subject matter is controversial and therefore some scenes were hard to watch. At the very least, it's thought-provoking and any fair-minded person should recognize there's no agenda here. The movie serves a noble purpose which is to get people thinking long after the credits roll.I'm looking forward to the next feature from Daily Wire and wish them much success in this endeavor.",Run Hide Fight
577,cmsenechalea,Very well done movie,10,14 March 2021,"Excellent movie. Kept us on the edge of our seats. Definitely a movie we will watch again and tell others to watch. Not for young people, though. There are graphic scenes and language, but for the first full length movie produced by Daily Wire, we were very impressed.",Run Hide Fight
578,susanlavertymoya,Great movie! Wasn't sure what to expect from Daily Wire's first movie...,10,25 February 2021,"First, I'm THRILLED to support the Daily Wire, given all of the cancel culture (and other absolute lunacy!) that's going on! Second, I wasn't sure what to expect of this movie, considering that this is their first movie (I think), but it played just like any other major production company's movie! Everything about it was professionally done, the actors (none of whom I knew but I bet I will see many times in the future) were great, and there was no PANDERING to any particular members of the audience! (What I mean by that is that just because the main character is a strong female who saves the day, she is not ""overdone"", like the typical stupid ""girl power"" type you see in so many mainstream production company movies!) It definitely had my heart racing at times, and even though I had only planned on watching part of it that night (it was late), I ended up having to watch the whole thing in one sitting. It really was excellent, and I look forward to more movies from the Daily Wire in the future!!",Run Hide Fight
579,bdkorthuis,Surprisingly good!,8,15 January 2021,"My wife wanted to see this and I will admit that I wasn't on board. I figured it would be a cheesy or hamfisted production. And when the movie started, the colour palette and first scene made me think I might be right. But the movie ended up sucking me right in and was far better than many Netflix or Amazon movies I have seen. The subject material was heavy but it didn't glorify the violence or trivialize real life events that have been similar (if this sounds vague, I am wanting to give NOTHING away, even if you saw the trailer and know what happens). Instead the movie focuses on the personal challenges and courage of the main character and shows great thought in how she handles her personal tragedy and circumstances. I saw one critic compare this to a teenage Die Hard (the only thing of value in the review). And to some degree that is accurate. Some of the injuries characters take are a brushed off a little too easy, just like John McCain in Die Hard. But also like Die Hard, this is the story of someone in a bad circumstance who courageously runs towards danger while everyone flees. It is the story of someone who could give up and even should give up and hide but instead jumps back into the proverbial fire to save as many people as possible.This was not a perfect movie. But it is well worth watching.",Run Hide Fight

I am happy that my kids' schools do ALICE Training as this movie shows exactly why we shouldn't just sit in a huddle like sitting ducks, and how a school secretary should not handle a report of a gun threat.This movie is a good one to start conversations with your older teens, and for adults to think of ways to prevent and/or save lives during an activity shooter situation as the old ways don't work.It is very violent, has bad language (nothing teens don't hear), and there is slight nudity.",Run Hide Fight
584,judrice,Good action movie,10,23 January 2021,Two thumbs up. Relevant for the times we live in. Not family friendly but not smut either. Slightly predictable in places with a couple of great twists.,Run Hide Fight
585,cardinalfang-24356,Mediocre in the Extreme,1,25 January 2021,"Having read some of the reviews for this film I had reasonably high expectations for this film but ended up very disappointed and only kept watching to the end because something might improve to justify those 10 reviews. One day better Director might be able to make a definitive 'School Shooting' action pic but after this morally dubious, cliched and ultimately dull effort I think it will be a long time before anyone tries . 3 stars for some of the acting but an overall 'don't bother'.",Run Hide Fight

589,jaycieafoster,Don't listen to Critics - Worth the Watch,10,15 January 2021,"Pleasantly surprised by this movie. I was nervous that this movie would have an overt conservative agenda that came across as cheesy, but it did not. I actually didn't feel like any sort of agenda was shoved down my throat at all, which was a really refreshing change of pace. This is just a great story about a horrible tragedy that some will think is taboo, but this kind of stuff does happen and the writers handled it well. They did not glorify the shooters, but instead highlighted the bravery of those who stood up to defend their classmates. The quality of the filming, the acting, and the script are all excellent. This is a movie I would expect to see in major theaters. Even if you're skeptical, give it a chance because this one is worth the watch.",Run Hide Fight

The second time was after showing my friends, who also enjoyed it a lot. It passed my expectations because I thought that since this is the very first production that the Daily Wire has, they would start with something less impressive than this. Thankfully, I was wrong!",Run Hide Fight
596,Chucko200,Great Joint with good acting; the last scene ruins everything,3,15 January 2021,"Run Hide Fight: ""Die Hard 7, John McClain's daughter Dies Hard in High School""(Spoiler Alert) This film, starring Tom Jane (of punisher and deep blue sea fame, and proud owning of TJ Max (he is the original ""maxinista"")). The main character, Zoe, not played by Tom Jane (who was busy stocking his shelves) is that one girl that everyone knew in high school that was a little off and you didn't know why, not in a bad way, just different, brought pictures to school of her trophy hunting kills. At 47 minutes and 45 seconds I have no finger nails left, it is a nail biter if I have ever seen one. It was a solid movie with good action and a very strong female lead character like something that hasn't been seen in action films since Alien and Kill Bill franchises. The last scene kills the entire movie. The girl goes on a spiritual as well as physical journey in the movie and conquers her literal and metaphorical demons and then in the last scene she succumbs to them for no good reason. If I watch the movie again, I will not watch the last scene. Seriously went from an 8/10m movie (which is a good movie rating for me) to a 3/10 in one scene.",Run Hide Fight
597,crossmichael-97283,Riveting!,10,15 January 2021,"It's been forever since I have seen a movie this good! The horror and tragedy of school shootings is captured so well in this film, I literally felt sick seeing it play out and I believe you're meant to feel that way.
This movie does not make an exhibition or spectacle of the violence, it's all there to either tell the story or put you square in the middle of the situation which is something that is done masterfully, you're right there with Zoe in the middle of this seemingly impossible situation. This movie is a masterpiece about heroism, legacy in its many forms, and the choices you make to create that legacy. I highly recommend this movie to anyone that enjoys a good nail biting thriller!",Run Hide Fight

I was worried about watching it with my teen, but in the end she said it was a really good movie and that she's glad she has cops (resource officers) at school.

612,rockcommen,An overall solid movie and nice shot at the Columbine shooters,7,8 May 2021,"Overall, this was a pretty good movie. Very watchable. The heroine is very likable and good actress. I like how they took a lot of the plot from the Columbine shooting and spun it back at them. As if it so, humanity will overcome their wickedness.The only downsides are the trailer gave away too much of the plot and the school wasn't as realistic as it could have been. For example, I've never seen so little students in a cafeteria. And, are you honestly telling me that no one else in the school would hear gun shots and van crashing into the cafeteria? Those are the weak points from me.",Run Hide Fight

The protagonist is a heroine, the antagonist is essentially the Joker from Dark Knight. Yes, it is about a fictitious school shooting so maybe the topic is not for everyone. I can certainly see the similarities with Die Hard.The film is said to be ""conservative-sponsored"" but I do not understand why this could not have been distributed by any of the major studios. Did I miss something? I do not believe that I was fed any outright propaganda. This movie is for all adults. If you enjoy action, this is definitely your thing.",Run Hide Fight

The storyline is doesn't have any plot holes, it's got great pacing and gives you characters that you can really relate to. I think Zoe is a character that women can actually look up to.

Some early reviews read like they were written by people who did not watch the film. I give it ten stars because I must play the numbers game to buffer out the haters who are rating it low for political reasons, but it's really a solid 7.5, which is not too shabby.I have seen worse films get better critical reviews. I think everyone unwilling to lick the liberal media's boots knows that there will be a propaganda battle to make people think this movie is bad, because this movie is produced by a conservative organization, and the number one rule of the hard left leaners is: Conservatives Must Not Have Any Successes.It's a good movie.Was it perfect? No. Was it a watchable action flick? You bet. Was it trying to shove an agenda down our throats? Meh...not really, though 2A-averse folk will say that it does. Of course, it is easy for them to forget they hate guns when they are churning out Jack Reachers, Mission Impossibles, James Bonds, and heck, Pitch Perfect III.Run Hide Fight follows high school senior Zoe Hull after she is caught in the middle of an active shooter situation on campus during the school day. Zoe's decision to fight back and save students and faculty makes her a modern hero. Or is it heroine? Can I even say heroine or would I possibly misgendering the character? I don't know anymore. Is it a crime to misgender a fictional character yet? How thin is this ice upon which I am treading?Zoe, played by Isabel May, is likeable. She appears jaded but is struggling with grief after the recent loss of her mother. She has closed communication with her father, and is blocking intimacy with her love interest, Lewis, played very well by Olly Sholotan, and seems to be eager to leave high school and get on with adulthood. When a group of four shooters takes over the school, Zoe must face a series of choices of whether to run, hide, or fight to stay alive. Her quick thinking is guided in part by the spirit of her mother, which is a lovely concept that is evoked well in the film.I liked this movie.I found a few things about the story line and character development implausible, mostly plot points and behaviors dealing with how people would react in real life, like say, a cafeteria full of students when a distracted gunman turns his back. Knowing basic human nature and our drive to survive, someone would surely sneak out, or perhaps attempt to disarm the shooters in some of their many distracted moments. Yes, even the shooters are addicted to social media and seem to be hunched over screens for nice, distracted bits of time.I don't buy how there seem to be only 7 adults in the entire school. I also feel like there were about 300-400 students on campus. Maybe it's a small school, but the scale made it feel small budget, which is okay, but it also made it feel like the writers and director weren't doing the job of addressing these details, either within the story line or in cinematography magic.I also had to struggle to think that Zoe would be the only person on the campus who can save everyone in the school. It's very John McClane, which was great for a movie written in 1988, but this is 2021 and we have evolved in character/story development since then and should know that audiences who show up for a realistic action film don't want to see tropes anymore, unless we are watching cartoons or comedies or comic adaptations. When every adult in school accept leadership from a high school girl with a shotgun, I was hoping for a ""yippie-ki ay, mother**cker."" Never heard it.I also don't buy that, with the ease some of the shooters initially shoot students and faculty, that the shooters aren't going for as high a kill count as they can reach. Mass school shooters I have read about seem to kill indiscriminately and desire a high kill count. Tristian Voy, the mastermind of the four shooters, played well by Eli Brown, doesn't seem to fit the profile of a mass shooter, and I'm not sure that his thirst for notoriety explains enough away to let me believe that they aren't just there to mow people down.And finally, at the end, when Zoe is sitting in the paddy wagon getting debriefed by the chief of police, I can't stop thinking of that tourniquet on her leg, because she'd been shot earlier in the film. Oh, and the crushed fingers on her left hand that everyone in continuity seemed to forget about. She should be in the ambulance.These sound like smaller details but, if you are creating a hyper-realistic movie, do your research into the psychology of behavior beforehand, so people like me won't be forced to pick to death a movie we actually like. Or call me. I'll fix the script for you.Having said that, the pacing was pretty good, with only one auditorium scene between Zoe and one of the shooters that went on too long, and it was well acted. I loved the cast. I think Isabel May is someone to watch out for, if she ever gets another job in the industry, which, although she should, she probably won't.Eli Brown plays a good villain. It's like Heath Ledger and Adrian Grenier had a baby, and that's a compliment, but his career is now probably over.Ollie Sholotan is great. He has fantastic screen presence and I want to see him become a star, but he will probably be doxed and cancelled and his home picketed just for being in the movie.End-of-critique caveat: I am hyper-critical because I teach creative writing and will pick apart any plot and characters I can get my hands. I can't help it. Sometimes I do it during the film, much to the dismay of my longsuffering spouse.My list of nays doesn't mean the film was bad. On the contrary. I was invested. I wanted to see what happened. The time flew by and the movie was over before I knew it and I didn't check my phone or clock once. I will probably watch it again and I recommend it to others. I hope this is the beginning of a long and prosperous evolution of a new entertainment media company.",Run Hide Fight
637,carlosxrodz,"Fantastic Film, Great Action, Beautiful Acting, Minimal Flaws",8,15 January 2021,"Run, Hide, Fight felt thoroughly engaging and real. Sure, in some ways it's a bit exaggerated in its portrayal of reality - but this is a movie we're talking about. The message and spirit of the film certainly elevates it, but it does so by avoiding being overly preachy.
The film's heroine, Isabel May (Zoe), gives a powerful, dynamic performance. Keep an eye on her future. Her antagonist, Eli Brown (Tristan) also gave a commendable performance.
The supporting cast were adequate. A couple lines of dialogue were delivered awkwardly but the majority of the performances were solid.
As an action thriller, this movie is gripping. It's not just bullets flying around an invincible hero. People get hurt. And they respond accordingly.
Some of the action itself was interesting in its use of the environment. Perhaps it wasn't groundbreaking, but the action was inventive and interesting.
And of course, the central themes of this film are strong. Even if they were weak and flubbed, I'd still lean towards a favorable review considering the obvious talent caught on camera.
My only concern of note might be its portrayal of mental illness. In some ways it works and it's accurate. But in some ways it feels callous toward some of the villains. Understanding their psychology was important to the film and it works for the most part, but I felt more work could have been done there.
Overall, the film was great. I'm definitely glad I watched it. Starting 2021 with a film like this certainly sets the bar.",Run Hide Fight

Many critics say this movie is very political, and is hurting the audience by discussing active school shootings; however, I disagree, there is dialogue that can be interpreted as political, but so little and so surface level that it does not sidetrack the overall story, unlike the majority of well watched films today. When it comes to the topic of it hurting or offending the audience, the critics say that the film is romanticising a terrible event, but film makers have been doing that for years with the civil war and world wars, and no such comments can be found about those films, so they can shut up.

And I am stunned. It is one of the most engaging movies I've seen in a long time.It's surprisingly tightly filmed, and actually plays off of the Movie Trailer. No, really. If you've watched the Trailer for the film, it teases big moments, and then pulls back for the movie. Hard to explain, so I'll give an example:At one point in the trailer, the school shooters slam the van through the cafeteria window and take everyone hostage. In the movie, they set up a perfect shot to match what was going to happen, and then they exploded a balloon in Chemistry class. It was done perfectly!

648,johnstoncityoflight,Intense Heroics,10,15 January 2021,"This movie is phenomenal.Be forewarned: it is not a movie for anyone sensitive to a high school shooting situation. It is also not for young children. (It earned the Mature rating: violence {shooting}, gore {shooting}, language {it's high school}, and some brief nudity {high school hostage situation}.) If that is you and/or the person you want to watch a movie with, keep scrolling.The movie follows a high schooler seriously struggling with something at home who goes to school one day and finds herself in the midst of a horror. The protagonist is forced to come to terms with psychological pain from recent trauma as she literally struggles for her life and, later, the lives of her classmates.Intense, thrilling, absolutely gripping. The writing is amazing and the acting is the best I have seen in years: real characters deal with real situations throughout the film. This movie highlights the brilliance of the human spirit, the willingness to put oneself on the line for others, while maintaining the humanity of everyone involved.Absolutely awesome. Very intense.

Great action, without sacrificing storytelling. I really felt invested in Zoe's character, and unlike the way most ""strong female characters"" are written in recent years, she's a true badass I found myself rooting for. Besides in episodes of The Mandalorian, I cannot recall another time where I've been literally cheering, out loud, for characters in film or television.My only critique is that I'd like to have seen more background of the shooters' history - you know, how exactly did they find themselves ultimately in this extreme scenario... really flesh them out... Kyp was the only one I felt I remotely understood, to the point where I was also sympathizing to an extent, and even cheering for him.

Writing was beyond great, the amount of lines that I remember is probably unhealthy, but there were so many that stuck with me.
Also, I love how even though this movie is about one of the scariest things ever (especially for me who was raised to be cautious) I was inspired. I was inspired to be a hero, not for the fame, but to be loving. Because love was a huge theme in this movie, and for the subject, that's incredible writing, just incredible.
There was love to help others no matter what, and instead of focusing on the shooters, we got a look into society. We saw how heroic us humans can be. This movie shows us ""this is the evil we have in the world, who runs on wickedness. But you know what's stronger, love for others."" Trust me, you won't see this theme, but you'll feel it.

Honestly I don't know why ""official"" reviewers rated the film so badly just because it touches on a very sensitive topic. Also, one of them compared it to Die Hard in a high school scenario. I don't see how that is a bad thing. I like the analogy, it's not a reason to give it a negative review.

689,goober-86223,"Great Action Film, Terrible Story",5,15 January 2021,"This honestly wasn't a terrible movie, but it certainly wasn't a great one either. The story makes no sense and on multiple occasions, if you have any common sense, you'll find yourself internally (or maybe even really) screaming at the screen.
I do appreciate the character arc; having a heroic character that's willing to actually get physical in a scenario where lives are on the line is a good message, and should be spread more. If there were more heroes in real life willing to fight back against evil when the lives of others are on the line, significantly fewer unjustified deaths would occur.
The biggest issue with this film is that it's plot has glaring holes that make no sense, and that some things necessary for a story are just blatantly missing. (i.e. antagonist motivations) This film also has the protagonist make some seriously questionable decisions morally, and leaves the viewer with a bitter taste in their mouth at the end of the film. There are also many of the tropes seen in major action movies, but if you go into this movie expecting those, it'll be less disappointing.All in all, it's about as good as any major action movie is.

That said, it's really a 7/10 or 8/10 movie, but to balance out the review bombs I gave it a 10.It's interesting how they took such a simple concept, a school shooting, and made it very real and relatable. It took me back to my days in High School, when there had been school shootings in my area and we had to go into lockdown a few times. Premise aside, the acting was very good, there was no unrealistic superhero-level strength or anything, and I was engaged throughout (no falling asleep here). My only criticisms are that I felt that the pacing was a bit off, it felt a little too fast in the beginning but was appropriate during the action scenes, and I wish they had spent more time developing the villains. The main antagonist's, Tristan's, motives seemed generic; I was hoping for a more unique motive where his backstory is explored a bit to show what led up to that moment. Maybe like a Mind Hunters-esque motive, touching on why serial killers are serial killers, but for school shooters. That said, I understand that they didn't want to give too much attention to the lives of the shooters, because that might encourage others. Overall, it is very good though!",Run Hide Fight

Not for nothing, but you can tell this movie was made entirely by people who never held a gun. Locker doors are used to stop bullets and apparently nobody in this Texas town has the ability to hear gunshots.
This movie tries so hard to be Die Hard but It forgets that injuries are supposed to have meaning. The protagonist gets shot in the leg and seems to be able to run full sprint with no problem.

Making a good movie about a school shooting is a very challenging thing to do, but this movie was undoubtedly successful in achieving just that.

717,boggerlife,As good as an Indie film can get,10,15 January 2021,"The film's story follows a 17 year old girl who is trapped in a school when it is attacked by 4 armed students, and takes the viewer on the journey with her during the ordeal as she discovers what she is capable of. It is never preachy about ""girl power,"" rather it shows her limitations and allows her to use the talents and abilities she has. The writer and director seem to have expertly tread through the minefield that is making a school shooting movie in the 21st century, and never used it as an opportunity to preach about gun control. Instead, it stayed focused on the story and characters. No movie is perfect, but the liberties it takes are rarely glaring or distracting, but instead meld into the story and add structure to the characters. The special effects in no way indicate this is an indie film, and are the best I have seen in one. In no way does the movie scream indie or low budget, it has the look and feel of a traditional studio film. The only real indication that it is an indie film is the lack of big name talent, but the actors are all talented in their own right. The lack of big names, and the quality of the actors present, allows you to view them less as an actor playing that part, and more as the person experiencing the story as you watch from the sidelines. If you have an opportunity to do so, watch this film without hesitation.",Run Hide Fight

You're job is literally to watch something and give an honest, unbiased review of it and yet you can't even do that right.

Well this movie is one of those. Absolutely pathetic, get a real job since you clearly aren't able to do this one.The movie was great, I enjoyed it from start to finish, and I fully intend to go out of my way to recommend it to EVERYBODY.

722,bbauer-91157,A gripping and triumphant story,10,15 January 2021,"Having been COVID-confined to the couch and an endless stream of movies and shows over the last year, Run Hide Fight stood out as one of the best movies I've had the pleasure to watch in recent memory. The story is an action-packed and engrossing journey through an incredibly tense situation that doesn't let up until the very end.One thing that I appreciated most was that Zoe, the main protagonist, wasn't the typical ""Mary Sue"" or superwoman-esque female lead that we have become so accustomed to. By that, I mean that she isn't able to easily dispatch men twice her size or have matrix-style fighting abilities, but instead relies on quick thinking and determination to carry her through.The villains were definitely as evil as they come, but they had elements of their character that almost make you want to feel sorry for them. The supporting cast and students were excellent as well.As a younger person, ""teenager"" dialogue in movies often comes across as horrible and clearly written by a 50-something boomer. Run Hide Fight breaks that mold and delivers a script that is well written and believable.For those of you concerned about such things, there was nothing overtly political or preachy about the movie. Too many of us have been subjected to cringey, garbage conservative movies before and, thankfully, this is definitely not one of them.The film isn't without its flaws, however. Gun enthusiasts will roll their eyes when they watch paper-thin locker doors completely block bullets, when a high-schooler has access to a fully automatic weapon, and other such nonsense.Those and other minor complaints aside, it really is a fun and engaging watch that I would recommend to anyone looking for a great action flick.",Run Hide Fight
723,johntylermorris-60865,It's Surprisingly Great,9,15 January 2021,"I was prepared to not care for this movie. It has exceptionally difficult subject matter first and foremost. It is easy to get this kind of story wrong. Additionally, there's some political motivation behind the production and distribution of this movie. I was expecting preachy propaganda undertones. Even when I ultimately agree with wedged in propaganda in movies, I find it almost always undermines the story being told.In reality, within a few minutes I was glued to the screen. I watched this at my multi-monitor computer. I had every opportunity to surf the web or play video games. I often do when watching movies or television on my computer. Not a chance with this movie. I was hooked and the time flew by. I was sad it was over when it was.It's not a perfect movie. A bit of the dialog is clunky. A few of the supporting characters aren't particularly good or well acted. There was a political dig or two sprinkled throughout. However, the main characters and cast are great, the production, direction, and cinematography are solid, the pacing is spot on, and heavy hitting scenes hit you like a ton of bricks.Special props to Isabel May, who plays the protagonist, Zoe Hull, and Eli Brown, who plays the primary antagonist, Tristan Voy. Neither have much of a filmography yet, but Isabel and Eli both killed it... so to speak. Great work!I would have been more than happy to shell out the exorbitant costs of seeing this in movie theaters, if this movie were in them and theaters weren't dying. I will buy it when it is available.

But I think the whole point of this was to inspire people to run courageously.I really enjoyed the movie and thought it was nicely done. I didn't think it was tasteless like another critic said, on the contrary, it was fiction which inspired me to think of ways I could personally fight back or run towards danger if it meant saving another life.Thanks so much again for this.

735,personalfritzpatrickleroy,A Pleasant Surprise,8,15 January 2021,"When I heard that the Daily Wire was putting out a film, I just assumed it would be another conservative propaganda film about how the left is oh-so horrible or something of the sort. However, I was surprised to see that the film was actually just a decent thriller that kept me wanting more.An important detail to note is just how good the female lead was. Unlike a lot of other action films with female leads, our protagonist is not a perfect being that can do no wrong. In fact, I'd say this is one of the more grounded portrayals of a ""strong woman"" I've ever seen in film. It's not afraid to show that she's flawed and a bit in over her head when deciding to take on the bad guys, but at the same time it never shies away from showing off her strength and wit, which she uses to overcome a seemingly unbeatable situation. This is far more believable than the Captain Marvels and Mulans of cinema as it gives women more of a realistic basis on how they can come out strong without necessarily being born as the strongest subject on the planet.Now, this film isn't perfect. There are times when the acting is a bit weak and the film has its fair share of unrealistic plot details, but it's nothing serious enough to take you out of the film for more than a moment if it does at all.Lastly, one complaint I seemed to notice a lot from more of the further right viewers during the live viewing was that the film was too ""woke"" since it had fair representation across the board. Personally, I do not see that as a valid complaint what-so-ever. If anything, that fair representation is a good thing as it adds to the realism; high schools are fairly diverse places after all.All in all, this was a pretty good film that I'd recommend to anyone who's into its subject-matter.",Run Hide Fight

I think there lacked some character development. The final scene of the movie (will try to avoid spoilers) really questions the ethics of the protagonist. Unlike most reviews I think this is a good thing. After watching the movie I just asked if I felt that what Zoe did was right. The movie accomplishes what the DW tried to do- compete with big Hollywood. Its not an amazing movie by means of CGI effect, big name actors, ect but it was the telling of the story.

Too often we remember the criminal and regrettably forget about the heroes and survivor and what they went through. It is a violent realistic movie that will most likely shock you but at the same time open your eyes on the evil that takes place and how our system isn't always reliable to respond in timely manner to avoid unforgettable tragedy.To fight a problem, we need to understand what the problem is and be real. We can't let people live in a bubble that is solemnly influenced by the mainstream views. People need to understand the seriousness of the issues, who to condemn, and what can be done to avoid it or reduce it as much as possible as evil will always surround this world.It is one of my top movie now and I highly recommend to see it. I also highly encourage more content creation of this sort that tackles dark issues in this country while offering an alternative viewpoint and change the narrative to remember the true heroes instead of portraying the criminals as a symbolic unfounded truth of deeper fabricated social issues that create division between the right and left and pushes political agendas.",Run Hide Fight

Originally I only chose to watch the film to support the launch of a ""conservative"" film because I believe in the message of challenging the cultural norms of Hollywood. I did not expect to like it. There wasn't violence for the sake of violence like I find in most movies of the same genre. All the violence fit into the story perfectly to tell the story of a brave young lady who's will to survive drives her to do whatever is necessary to save her classmates and take down the evil that threatens them. I expected a lot of political commentary and messaging, but honestly it wasn't there. It was a heroic thriller.

The main character is a great heroine, and uses her whit to save the innocents of her school. Although she can come off a bit too snarky at times. Her friend I wish got a little more development during the film, but overall is a bit of comical relief in such a serious movie. The shooters all have arcs from a range to decent to great. The sister doesn't get much screen time, but her brother gets some development. The practical discord mod looking guy has a nice arc, and the main villain is someone you really want to see stopped. I wish his motives could be a bit clearer sometimes, but he is certainly very evil and menacing. I'd say the worst thing about this film is the theme, which contradicts itself by the end of the film.

It did a good job portraying the horrors involved in the school shootings that plague the U.S. to this day. It has a few plot holes, such as why the police take so wrong to arrive. There are more but it does feel slightly unrealistic. But it is mostly minor details that do not distract from the main point of the movie. The acting is generally good, especially the impressive performance of Isabel May, in her acting debut. Even the supporting roles are (for the most part) well executed. The ""problem"" with this movie that I believe the critics have is it is entirely non-political, it pushes no messages, aside from a brief mention of God and free-will. This is a great movie, although at some points hard to watch. Hats off to The Daily Wire as well as Kyle Rankin. Side Note: The ending was very weird, gave me mixed feelings how quickly the mood changed.",Run Hide Fight
746,rmarkhyer,"Very good, best movie I've seen in a long time",10,15 January 2021,"I couldn't stop watching this movie, it is one of the best movies I have seen in a very long time. I've read that some critics are giving it bad reviews, that is not surprising since the movie was made by conservatives and cancel culture is trying to shut down everything they can that doesn't fit their narrative. This movie should win best picture hands down. I look forward to more movies by The Daily Wire.",Run Hide Fight
747,josephgunderson,Absolutely fantastic!,10,15 January 2021,"This film was incredible. The story was gripping from beginning to end. I don't believe there was ever what one would call a slow moment in the entire thing; from beginning to end the story moves forward. Don't leave your seat because you will, undoubtedly, regret missing something. The lead is unbelievably talented, as well as her co-stars.

751,jtann-95382,"Thrilling suspense, interesting characters!",10,15 January 2021,"This was fantastic movie. Suspenseful, yes, but more importantly from my standpoint, a story about truly interesting, fleshed-out characters. Heroes and villains all have unique, consistent, yet not stereotypical motivations---no cliches, no cardboard characters who just spout lines to advance a plot. I felt by the end that I had really gotten into the minds of these people, not just the major characters, but many of those with just a few lines of dialog as well.
Great writing, totally believable acting, unobtrusive cinematography. Just a great movie!! Looking forward to watching this again with my family and seeing more work from all involved in this production.",Run Hide Fight

Action was realistic (young girl doesn't magically overpower men larger than her), the acting was top notch, and the story is both well written and believable.Critics dislike the movie simply because it does not throw in politically correct propaganda to keep the woke happy and it was produced by a conservative company (although this movie is not political in any way).

760,sspietila,Better Than Expected,9,15 January 2021,"I went into this movie hoping for it to be good, but not expecting much. As a movie put out by an openly conservative show, I was expecting it to fall in the line with Christian movies, overly in-your-face about the morals, and sacrificing entertainment value for that sake. I tuned in to watch, because I though that expectation, combined with the suspenseful trailer, would make the movie an entertaining train wreck.The film, however, was far different, and far better than I expected. Rather than feeling like I was being preached to, it was refreshing to watch a film that sought to entertain first. Modern movies and shows are so infused with Hollywood leftist morals and talking points, that they forget their purpose is to provide entertainment first. And this film did the opposite.",Run Hide Fight

This film is crisp, edgy, and it really gave all the characters depth even if their screen time was limited. You go through the movie saying, ""hey she reminds me of this person or that person."" I felt like I was a teen again watching Die Hard in 1988, but this films cadre of terrorists were a rag-tag bunch of self-important snowflakes who wanted their viral 15 minutes of fame to get back at a high school and a ""system,"" that they felt wronged them instead of mercenaries hiding under the veil of Red Army Faction or.

Isabell May did an incredible job. We were rapt the whole movie. Only reason i don't give it a full 10 is there were 2 or 3 scenes where just by the way the scene was framed and timed i knew what was going to happen.

I've asked my daughters to be certain they sit down and watch this movie with my teenaged grandchildren. The young actors were incredible and relatable, representing the student body makeup of a typical American high school. There are disturbing scenes but they should be viewed with the knowledge that ""this"" actually happens more often than we want to believe. You may assume ""this"" refers to the attempted takeover of the school but it doesn't. ""This"" is the story of the people who persevered and their stories will outlive the memories of the quartet of tyrants who triggered the events. The movie was extremely well-made with many scenes that will be unforgettable. Thanks to the pandemic, our family has watched a LOT of movies this past year. We've spent time laughing at the cinematic goofs and unbelievable story lines of so-called ""popular"" movies, wondering why the critics had hyped them so positively? It's easy to replay, and pick apart, movie scenes when you are stuck at home for months on end. This movie is most certainly not one of those cookie cutter films. It is frightening, chilling and yet it gives hope. Bad things will always happen. The way we choose to respond to them dictates how those events will be remembered. We have a lot more influence on the events surrounding us than we realize. All we must do is simply open our eyes.",Run Hide Fight

You would never notice that the film was funded by conservatives if you weren't told. Nobody acts preachy and the only references to faith in the film are lifted directly from the event's of Columbine. I think for those who haven't studied these school shooter events the movie will be a great action thriller, but for those who have kids in school, or have read up on these events and the psychology of the situations will find it more of a horror film as it's a fairly strong synthesis of several real hostage situations and school shootings that when mashed together make an all to possible nightmare.",Run Hide Fight

814,dionvanhaasen,A quality movie!,10,16 January 2021,"Very good movie, coming from someone with high standards for when a movie is considered 'good'. I wouldn't actually rate it a 10, it's more like a 7 to 8. But when a game is played unfair by the 'opponents' (extremely politically biased critics), you're forced to play the game unfair aswell in order not to lose. The movie on itself isn't politically motivated at all, but the reason behind producing this movie is to fight back as conservatives, against the system (including left-winged Hollywood) by creating their own platform. And that's why the rating of the critics (who are part of the system) is so low. And at this point it seems like they aren't even pretending like they aren't biased anymore. They stopped hiding it, because people will still be fooled by them anyway. Plus it's a form of virtue signaling to rate this movie so poorly. But honestly, their biased ratings only proves the need for a conservatives to build their own platforms, to build their own system.Anyway, the movie was great.

816,britconservative,These young actors have a great future,8,16 January 2021,"I'll judge a movie on how it engages me, on how it rivets me to my seat and keeps me there until the final credits roll and I breathe normally again.Yes, Run, Hide, Fight is a great movie. It's carried by a solid script and some special acting from our protagonist and the main villain of the piece.Be prepared not to be fed the usual diet of cliches of a Hollywood popcorn movie. Why, when pinned to the ground in such films, does the hero fumble around and find a convenient object with wish to bash the enemy on the head? Countless films and series employ this hackneyed technique. Not here. The action in this film can be somewhat visceral, brutal and disturbingly real. You will definitely be questioning within your own mind what you or your loved ones would or should do in such a febrile and horrific situation. And, just as the answers do not come easy, your choice of action would be fraught with difficult options.SPOILER ALERT - some nice touches like the bathroom scene in which our heroine feels around in the ceiling for a suspicious object, but misses the imprint of the gun in the ceiling dust. The self-sacrifice of the lunchlady with all the terror, resignation and determination conveyed through her eyes. The protagonist giving back the shotgun to the broken gunman in an offer of redemption, after which he pays with his life, as all actions have consequences.It's not perfect though (what is?). I feel the title could have been something less descriptive of what happens. You can't boil down this movie to 3 words. The last action scene involves our heroine shooting the villain with a high-powered rifle, close to the police, SWAT, media and parents, yet everyone comes running a little late for my liking. A minor gripe - but hey, it is a review.I can't help but think these actors have a great future ahead. As long as they are not cancelled.",Run Hide Fight

A beginning, a middle and an end that ties it all together with a pretty, fitting bow. We have a teen heroine that does what she feels is right without having to wear a ""Girl Power"" shirt, psychotic teens with a well thought out plan but no superpowers to help them beat bullets and the sad truth that most people will not react during a crisis.

She finds herself and her courage in helping others and saving lives. This is a message for today's American youth-stand up for what you believe in and fight against tyranny.

919,zlovell-40651,Solid movie,8,16 January 2021,Heart was thumping for the first maybe hour and a half of it. Which is basically the entire movie. It was really good main actors/actresses were excellent. They didn't ride the Jesus train too much either which I think is great.,Run Hide Fight

You just know you'll need to be effusive in praising the effort, (if not the production). This is actually a very intense thriller with terrific acting and a fun script. This film had several opportunities to be as disappointing as many well-liked action/thrillers when it came to protagonists facing physical or armed conflict, but resolved them well and believably.",Run Hide Fight

927,morrismatthew-91076,Pretty decent and better than expected,9,16 January 2021,"Disregard the ""critics"" ratings and comments about this movie as they appear to be trying to politicize a what is a basic thriller/suspense-type movie. Frankly, the movie's topic (active shooter situations in schools) needs more air time for people to consider and think through the various issues. The plot was a tad predictable in spots, but nonetheless served as a decent backbone for the story. I thought the mother's portrayal was inventive. Most importantly, it shed light on the fact that school response plans to active shooter situations not only need to be revisited but also suffer from being publicly known due to the nature of their creation through open-meeting processes. I had never considered that before.",Run Hide Fight

941,trc-11321,Gripping and not annoying,9,16 January 2021,"Hits all the right notes for a gripping thriller PLUS it's not annoying right up to the end. The closing scene is implausible and off-tune from the excellence of the rest of the movie but I forgive that given how much I enjoyed the rest of the movie.My biggest takeaway was excitement at the prospect that this is the first of a whole new movie industry based on freedom, self-reliance and religious faith instead of atheistic, only-government-can-make-things-right victimhood.",Run Hide Fight

The storyline draws you in to care about certain characters; their pain becomes your pain (boy, does it HURT).
The greatest thing is that the film displays the decisions people make in this kind of horrific scenario, and highlights courage and selflessness at the risk of death more than it ogles the criminals.
HIGHLY recommend.",Run Hide Fight

The fact that there are consequences for courage and gray moral areas make it more real. It is also not a super hero movie or something dumber is nice.

It's great cinematic art, fantastic character development, and actor performances are simply stellar. It gives you a much needed conversation about a real life issue and does not shy away from it. It's gritty, raw, and realistic. Super edgy from a conservative media company, but it's void of all politics. It's just a great movie every American could watch that tells an impressive story.

Excellent acting and character development with the exception of the police officers (although I couldn't tell if they were meant to appear unskilled and confused or if the acting just wasn't comparable to the rest of the cast). Cinematography was very good. The message I received is that so many of our youth in America are struggling and the public education system is failing, especially those students with psychological challenges. I especially liked the diversity of characters and how so many issues were showcased (e.g., violence, mental illness, courage, integrity, anger, forgiveness, accountability, teamwork, staff shortages in schools, inadequate infrastructure in rural communities, etc.). The few teachers with key roles were presented positively. This was my first time watching a 'conservative' movie. A Hollywood movie I watched last week with many well known and respected actors wasn't nearly as well done (e.g., undeveloped dialog and characters, missed opportunities to use the talents of highly-skilled actors, amateur plot, etc.).

She has only a few weeks left before she starts a new life at Purdue University. However, four nihilistic, gun-totting students attack her school-their motive: to be famous.It's easy to shrug Run Hide Fight off as a high school version of Die Hard, but the story goes deeper than Yippy-Yi-Kay Mother@#$%er. In the face of death, there's an excellent dialogue about free will and the idea that no matter where we go, we can never escape who we are.To those who describe the film as being made by someone who has seen too many movies. Well, no kidding, sport. Any filmmaker worth their salt wears their influences on their sleeve.Isabel May is excellent as Zoe Hull. She proves she can handle a complex character who's battling external and internal wars. Eli Brown is also perfect as Tristan Voy, the lead villain. He's balanced, He doesn't go overboard with his villainy.This film is intended for mature audiences who love the art of filmmaking and storytelling.

Coming from someone who feels that action films can often be a lot of explosions and violence with a weak plot line, I was HIGHLY invested in this story that absolutely has the plot to support the action, extraordinarily led by Isabel May with gumption.

Also the guy who plays the leader of those participating in the shooting plays his part so well....even flashes of the Heath Ledger's Joker (IMO).

I was saddened to see all of the critics trash it simply because they don't like certain politics behind it.If you ask me, there's not really politics in this movie unless you say using gun for hunting or self defense is politics.Give this movie a shot! The acting was honestly really good, especially the main actress. It was truly thrilling. I was engaged every minute. They did a good job of showing rather than telling. They were good character arcs, great action, tents and stressful moments.I appreciate that they were able to do this movie and show the girl in the school as being a hero, without going over the top. It was also really cool to have a female lead hero where it was believable and the movie didn't shove that concept down your throat.It's not the best movie you'll ever see, but honestly, it's one of my new favorites. Definitely the best movie I've seen in a while.",Run Hide Fight

1024,catlyncomstock,Rewatch again and again,10,17 January 2021,"A truly gripping movie that my husband and I have enjoyed watching multiple times since its premiere. Its gritty, no-holds-barred realism makes it an honest portrayal of the complex dynamics at play in the tragedy of a school shooting. We especially appreciate that the movie doesn't overly focus on the shooters' points of view and motives (and thus glorifying them) as other movies have. These other movies may be a fascinating case study in the psychology of evil, but Run Hide Fight is a refreshing look at the psychology of heroism and bravery and encourages all viewers to strive for these noble ideals.",Run Hide Fight

I really enjoyed Run Hide Fight, watched it with my wife and made some cheese popcorn and a bourbon/coke drink. I generally break down movies into 3 parts - acting, writing and set. All were top notch. You didn't feel like you were watching a B movie (though some of them are great). The acting felt natural, not wooden.

While the topic may not be a comfortable subject with many, the story of what this young girl overcomes and the solid acting effort by the 'mainly' young cast made for a great watch. I found Isabel May to be an excellent fit for the role. Her portrayal of a damaged, hurting teen that doesn't use the event as the next thing to break her down but instead provides a purpose and the focus to step up.",Run Hide Fight
1028,lilichka-83682,Perfect for the times,10,17 January 2021,"Honestly, this movie couldn't have come at a better time. It perfectly sums up 2020, left out all of the politics and the Covid of the world, which every show coming back had, yet still staying inclusive. The biggest takeaway is how impactful the media is on people and society. How much influence the media has and demonstrated what a turn of events would be like had media had less power or were held accountable. A little unrealistic that a 17-year-old girl took down mass shooters, but still excellent concept.",Run Hide Fight
1029,SMCollins33,"Good, but not great",6,17 January 2021,"It was an enjoyable movie, but it had it's flaws. The internal struggle of the main character, overcoming the loss of her mother, was intriguing but failed to drive the character's motives or at least didn't connect well enough. That could be said for many of the storylines in the movie, where things did not connect fully and were left as a quasi-cliche. For example, the main antagonist talked a lot about the plans to take over the school and how the emergency response is public knowledge. This could have been a powerful commentary about school security, but it sort of fell flat.I did think the plot overall was good and some of the effects were well done. I also thought the acting was pretty well done, There are some very, very graphic scenes.I might watch it again, but I'm not chomping at the bit to do so. It's not as bad as some of the reviews claim, but it's also not the greatest movie ever as others claim.(Full disclosure: I do listen to Matt Walsh & Ben Shapiro frequently, as well as read The Daily Wire.)",Run Hide Fight

Great cinematography and tension building as well, really keeping you on the edge of your seat for the entire runtime of the film. The only gripes I have with it are that there are some predictable moments, to be expected when you're dealing with an old formula, and a few inconsistencies here and there.

When Zoe gets injured, she's actually injured instead of that stupid thing that most movies do where a character is severely beaten and shot and as a broken limb and yet somehow still fights off the bad guys miraculously. Zoe has to get creative and get some unexpected help from the outside to accomplish her mission.

There was no forced emotion created by music during the tense emotional scenes.I won't give away any spoilers but this movie had a great message to go along with it. Please watch this and share with family and friends. The movie is quite violent though. There is a good amount of students that are killed during throughout the movie.

I have to give them a lot of props for not using this movie as a platform to spread a political agenda like so much of Hollywood so often does. First and foremost its a breath of fresh air because the politics are set aside. So sad that's a plus nowadays. Every other movie I watch these days seems to be trying to shove some BS message down my throat. But besides all of that, the movie truly had me gripped. Writing is good, the storytelling is good, acting from 90% of ppl were on point, there were a few scenes that could be taken as bad acting but I think they were actually trying to portray a socially awkward teen. Which is a plus for realism in my book. Some conveniences to the plot but nothing unbelievable like so many other movies' nowadays. Its Die Hard 1 but set in a school.

This movie is phenomenal. The acting is inconsistent, for sure, but it almost doesn't matter because our lead and the villain give such dynamic performances, and because the screenplay and cinematography capture your attention. It's extremely intense, but not so intense that it keeps you from being entertained, which is a massive feat considering the subject matter. The underlying message about not giving these monsters the fame they crave, therefore eliminating any feeling that they've done something worthwhile, is a message our society isn't getting enough. In fact, the message was rejected by Hollywood, and is being attacked by Hollywood, likely because they stand to profit when we give these monsters that kind of attention.

1086,ajamarceau,"By modern standards, it was a an exceptional movie",10,19 January 2021,"The movie explores the human capacity to deal with grief, how faith will support someone in times of hardship, and the human capacity to both perform both great deeds and horrific acts. Characters had very realistic life stories, and it portrays the alacrity that you see in many stereotypical high school environments, and were the system fails.
the worldview ""that nothing you do matters"" is brought into sharp contrast with deadly escapade of a quartet of broken individuals who shatter the calm at your everyday, every-American high school.
As an entertainment piece, it is a well acted, well-written production, with the thriller grasp of any of the movie greats, (think diehard, but a real-life situation). It is a believable piece, were it could be a documentary on the phycological make-up of the ""mass-shooter"" and they do an excellent job showing how shallow these individuals ambitions for fame and notoriety really is, there is no glamour.",Run Hide Fight

But on 'Run Hide Fight' they kept the plot in a way which is tense but also entertaining by keeping the fiction aura in the air.

1119,sandyfenton,Entertaining and Inclusive,8,19 January 2021,"Loved this film. Great start for The Daily Wire. I never read ""professional critic"" reviews but have to wonder how they could hate a movie with a young female hero, her black best friend, and even a beautiful ""big girl"" who steps up to help save the day. So inclusive! You'd think they would love it when the bad guys are all gun-toting crazy white boys. But darn, I there are some good white men in it too so I guess that cancels the woke intersectional hierarch ;-). My only objection is the use of a tired emotional manipulation technique, what I call ""the dead mother movie."" Unfortunately that's especially painful for me since mine died at the exact same age as this main character. The depiction is realistic in some ways (the main character's toughness, resiliency, and attitude) but pretty silly in others (the mother - I won't say more to avoid a spoiler).

That said, I've reflected on this movie a lot in the last 24 hours. Isabel May is a fabulous actress, far better than the rest of the crew, although I did like Olly Sholotan too.This is a story about a young girl who is struggling emotionally from a recent family tragedy. Wrapped in her emotions, she finds herself uniquely positioned to over come them and fight back against her schools intruders, demonstrating her individuality and courage to step up in a time of utter stress for herself and her peers. The ultimate theme of the movie is selflessness, and selfless actions are demonstrated throughout.The one criticism I have is that it was violent, and I don't think the producer fully capitalized on all the available emotional moments to really ""hook"" the viewers.Overall, well done, I recommend!",Run Hide Fight

Wonderful acting as well... its quite the surprise, not sure how long those younger actors have been acting but they did a very good job.

Some would say that this movie ""glorifies school shootings"" or ""opens old wounds for Americans."" The opposite couldn't be more true - the film exposes the pure evil of people who commit such vile acts as well as promote the virtues many in America could do more with, especially a close family and valor in the face of adversity.

1168,zelondra,"Great in the unrealistic aspects, lacking realism.",5,20 January 2021,"I really wanted to like the movie, the acting was fairly good but unfortunately the writers didn't do justice in the dialogue. It was a typical cliche movie in regards to the unrealistic aspects that do not transcends to the real world. The main female character is too scrawny to have pulled off some of the things she did when combating the one boy especially being injured. She has no upper body strength or leg strength and I know this as I use to be her size in HS. The father would have never been able to just hitch a ride on a swat vehicle, as much as we all like to know our fathers would go the distance to save us. Also, if the girl really liked her friend before all this happened it would have been obvious not after she just went through a traumatic event which usually creates the false scenario in which is depicted in the movie when he's laying on the couch injured. I don't have any objection to them liking each other just the execution in how she admits to him about her feelings towards home. They never actually gave an indication she might return those feelings prior to so that's why it's not believable for me. This is my opinion based on my perception and experience.

I'm curious if the first couple of days filming were actually the start of the film and people are starting to get a feel for each other. But the plot of this movie picks up, and picks up FAST!

1176,coltrucker,Thrilling and Productive!,10,20 January 2021,Much better than I anticipated. The movie does a great job giving you a thrilling experience while making the outcome a lesson we can all learn about these situations. Telling the story of a school shooting while showing that the kids who are responsible for these events are nothing to be praised and the media needs to focus on the heroes of the situation. Giving them the satisfaction of attention only causes more kids to act out in this way. The filmography was spectacular considering this was a first for this company.

It asserts the viewpoint that it is actually beneficial to understand gun safety and how they work in order to combat would-be wrongdoers.Meanwhile the Metacritic reviewers are slandering and tanking the movie ratings because they fear actual diversity of thought and think it's dangerous for people to understand conservative viewpoints.

There were no super heros, no brilant children coming to the rescue of ignorant adults. It did show how sticking rigidly to directives and policies written by bureaucrats, and not using your brain, can lead to bad results.I think the conflict between her and her dad was not well explained and left me wondering what was the root cause as well as the relationship between her mother and herself was not explained.

1246,rougeshadow,Surprisingly Good,8,25 January 2021,"I was excited to see this but I didn't have my hopes up that it would blow me away. It didn't. But I was pleasantly surprised by how good it was. I had my skepticism about how Ben Shapiro was praising this movie because of how good it was and seeing how he made it I knew it could be bias talking and the movie could have been mediocre. The reviews don't do it justice surprise surprise, and Google has hidden their user review section, which is why I'm reviewing here.The performances in this movie by the main cast were great. Eli Brown's performance of Tristen was spectacular and stood out as my personal favorite. Isabel May, who plays Zoe, was a great performance but I think her dialogue felt off, thats also a problem with the script I think. Cyrus Arnold (Kip), and Britton Sear (Chris) both did fantastic jobs at playing the ""weird kids"". Zoe's father, Thomas Jane, was alright I felt like his dialogue was flat a lot but I could see that being an effect of a hardend veteran dad. Last I want to touch on is Olly Sholotan (Lewis), he wasn't in the film too often but the parts he was in he was great, definitely top 3 in the film. I want to push how amazing Eli Brown's performance was, it was some of the best acting I've seen in a while from a movie like this.Last thing I want to touch on is about the movie itself. Being a high-school student, this movie feels so real. Most people criticize writers for being out of touch, this is exactly how I would think this would go down. The way the students interact with each other here felt real as well.Overall, the critics bashing this movie are doing it for 1 reason and 1 reason alone, its from Daily Wire. Dont let those reviews discourage you from watching this movie. The user scores are extremely positive and I dont doubt you'd look at those instead. But watching it is exclusive to Daily Wire members which is a letdown since you have to pay for it but I dont see where else they could put it so it doesn't bother me too much.

1253,erwinsphone,Not your typical Hollywood film,8,25 January 2021,"I was a little skeptical at first as I've seen some pretty uninspiring movies from independent studios. Such was not the case for Run Hide Fight.It kept my attention the whole time. I think it conveyed poignant lessons, on several levels. The casting was good; the lead reminded me of Jennifer Lawrence.
It was not a typical Hollywood film. It realistically depicted horrific violence without being too gory. It didn't have pointless chase scenes and ridiculous shootouts. The role of technology in the plot was thought provoking.",Run Hide Fight

1258,ashnoble-68367,Captivating and thought provoking.,10,26 January 2021,"This film is quiet simply a gem. It blatantly shows that bad guys will always have guns, but it is up to the good guys with guns to even the playing field when the police/authorities are unable to. I also found myself very impressed with the implementation of a specific scene. There was a young girl that is asked somewhat of an age old question for Christians ""If God is real why would he let all these bad things happen""? Her response was absolute and indisputable truth, and I thought it showed the more gritty side of faith. No matter what, everything will never be ALL flowers and rainbows as some like to foolishly believe. This film shows raw sides of what reality really looks and feels like, if your eyes and ears are actually open to absorbing reality.",Run Hide Fight

Well done, great acting, good plot, good message, 10 out of 10 would recommend to anyone who is of an appropriate age, may be a little to much for small kids, but is still something they should be educated about. I really like how the movie emphasized getting the students out of the building instead of just hiding in the classroom, I feel like getting out is more important than hiding, so I really like how that was portrayed, also liked the strong reasonable female character, she was really good, awesome to see! Thanks for making this Daily Wire, very well done!",Run Hide Fight

1278,rainesmw,Better than you'd expect,10,30 January 2021,"I'm usually wary of action movies with a female lead because either the first half of the movie is about her frailty and self doubt and every male questions her ability, or she is some cartoonish badass with high heels and one liners.Within the first ten minutes of the movie we establish that she's a bit tomboyish, she has angst from her mother's premature death, her dad is the alpha everyman, she's in the nerdy outcast group at school and the cool guys ignore her hotness because of her weirdness. By the book yes, but not half the damn movie to establish it. Maybe it's me but I hate when movies really drag out the back story.The rest plays out like a typical action movie, and yes there are a lot of Die Hard parallels with the charismatic villain leader who likes to posture and not get his hand dirty, and the internal/external communications. We are spared many of the action cliches like ridiculously long combat scenes, or drawn out mortally wounded good guys coughing out dying inspiration, or one in a million shots (eh maybe one but this is non spoiler).Some criticize police response/tactics, and yes they take some license here, but in doing so avoid getting bogged down in external plots. This isn't a police movie, and their involvement is enough to know things are happening outside without pulling away from the plot. (Probably the worst scenes of Die Hard was the pulling rank and jurisdictional beef with the police)Is this a pro 2A puff piece? NoIs it the best action film I've ever seen? NoIs it worth watching? AbsolutelyIs it the 10/10 I gave it, no but the metacritics are a bunch of self adoring weenies who have terrible taste and even worse politics. This could be Scarface meets Citizen Kane and they would still downvote it.",Run Hide Fight

Don't get me wrong its not perfect, as there are a few parts that have that unrealistic ""Hollywood feel"". Those parts are far and few between though.

1281,sarah-36516,You will be on the edge of your seat,10,30 January 2021,"I've never reviewed a movie before so here goes..... Run Hide Fight has given me a full understanding and appreciation for why kids in America may be fearful of being at school, knowing that a shooter or group of shooters could storm the school and massacre everyone inside at any moment. The character Zoe Hull is trying to come to terms with the loss of her mother while also try to get through the remaining weeks of her senior year in highschool when disaster strikes in the form of crazed, gun-toting teenagers breaking into the school. The range of emotions I felt while watching left me holding my breath and on the edge of my seat with nearly every scene. The characters are fully three dimensional and not like cardboard as seen in box office-smashing movies, the acting is truly ultra-high quality and the storyline flows beautifully with epic twists and turns. Ignore the low reviews from critics, they are either blind or braindead. I assure you this movie is an absolute must-see. I'm rating it a full 10/10 because to me it's seriously very good.",Run Hide Fight

1284,katheader,Enjoyable Film,8,30 January 2021,"I found this film very riveting beginning to end- although, there were some violence that was really hard to watch. The story is written in such a way that you develop empathy for all involved And Zoe is just a badass! My two issues was how the cops were portrayed as completely idiotic and I had a real issue with Zoe's last action- at that point in the story, she's no longer being a hero, she's acting as a murderer- which is why I gave it an 8.

1288,mudrooster,Enjoyed the film - it was relevant to our society today,8,31 January 2021,"Highlights for me were the value of courage in women, friends, family to support each other - albeit in a school shooting drama that I found more realistic than Die Hard frankly. The movie plays along with with some new twists to what seems a Die Hard remake. But it has more relevant themes for us - not as funny but good non the less. Issues in our society such as bullying, the invisible people, value of family through thick and thin, partnerships between teachers, students and regardless of race. It's TVMA and shows depravity people are capable of. But it's also a movie that reveals goodness in humanity amongst a terrible situation. The lead character and her dear friend show grit, intelligence, compassion and justice.",Run Hide Fight

1291,brucepmobile,I Was Completely Drawn In,10,31 January 2021,"I watched two movies in one day. The first was a major studio release, which was easy to get onto my TV screen. I spent most of the time checking my watch to see how much time was left. The second was distributed through the Daily Wire web site, and it was a pain in the neck to get where I could see it on anything bigger than a phone screen. Yet I did not look at my watch once. That's really all you need to know.What makes it work is that you really understand the characters. Regardless of politics (which is mostly an issue here because of the distributor, not the film content), you get stuck in a film because you can feel what the characters feel. I completely understood the protagonist's grief and hostility, the best friend's hopeless affection, and even the venal motivations of the villain and his henchmen.The emphasis on character and its generally positive message indicate a film designed to appeal to the audience rather than the critics. We need more films like this.",Run Hide Fight

1299,keithdecarlo,Well worth a watch,9,1 February 2021,This was a good movie that kept you entertained through the whole thing. Lots of different things at work like a young girl struggling with the loss of her mom or the big question how could God let something like this happen. The movie could have done a little better job explaining why things like this can happen other than just stating free will. That is my only ding in this movie. Great acting by the cast especially our hero who spends half the movie wounded and I never really catch her forgetting that she has been wounded as in she stops limping. We have a lot of A actors who get wounded in a movie and magically forget they are wounded.I just watched one yesterday morning where the actor is shot in the shoulder but then limos through the movie. I have never been shot there but I can't imagine it affects your legs. But then he can run around carrying a bad with the arm attached to the shot shoulder. Anyway I digress this was an entertaining movie that makes some good hard hitting points and makes you think about active shooter policies in school. One policy doesn't work for every scenario. How accurate the policy they portray is I don't know but it doesn't seem far fetched.The ending hits a little on how dangerous these situations can be when the cops cuff our hero. In these situations the police have no idea who the bad guys are and if you enter and make a mistake an innocent child looses their life. In these situations you don't know who the bad guys are and it's easy for them to blend in because they are all just kids. Again a lot going on in this movie can open up discussions in so many areas. Watch the movie you won't be disappointed.,Run Hide Fight
1300,nkosoris,Overall Pretty Good,8,1 February 2021,"A very exciting and action-packed movie. It reminded me of why I used to enjoy action movies. Probably the best female protagonist I've ever seen. I honestly expected it to have a lot of conservative politics that weren't there -- it was just a genuinely good movie.The very last scene I could've done without. I get the point being made, but I prefer my heroines a bit less morally ambiguous than the ending presented. If the movie had ended after she talked to her dad, I'd have probably given it a perfect rating.",Run Hide Fight

The school hostage scenario is creative and also has realistic examples of the many possible flaws with contemporary School Administration and Law Enforcement notions of how to respond to Active Shooter threats.

Making her the most important person in the film was certainly a departure from the cookie cutter Hollywood tripe. Rather than focusing on the darkness within the depraved souls committing the atrocities, the film makers instead focus on how real people overcome personal trauma and rise above the waves, instead of being consumed by darkness. The only negative was that obviously the producers and directors weren't actual hunters, and it shows. But most people seeing the film aren't either, so no big deal....",Run Hide Fight

Treat is getting old. Can't believe it. He was a great cast addition.I thought the story line was apropos to what we know about similar events. Having a ""student"" take action I felt was what is needed in this country -- There have been other interventions in the US by citizens in mass shootings. The drivel of the left felt appropriate as well. I liked the ending but would have crushed the head with the rock... Thanks for the film. I know it should but won't get major play.

Thankfully, the movie highlights that even a young student enduring the loss of a parent and having to deal with the surviving parent who is also trying to deal with the loss of a spouse, that young person was able to prevail under the duress of the horrific attack on her school by fellow students who believed they were ""wronged"". She was able to think clearly and selflessly about the situation and because of the way she was raised she was able to cope much better than a child who was not taught survival skills as she obviously was. I pray we never have to deal with another school shooting ever but until school bullying is dealt with and children learn the difference between right and wrong and consequences for their actions they will continue to only think about themselves and how ""they"" feel.",Run Hide Fight

It is action and emotion packed and has no real slow spot in the movie after the first 20 minutes. It handles the natures and stereotypes of high schoolers better than most recent shows have. It is definitely not a children's movie(I would say minimum 16 and up).

1336,bapodoll,Outstanding and intense film!,9,9 February 2021,"In some ways, Kyle Rankin's Run Hide Fight reminds me of a Clint Eastwood-directed film. The performances are somewhat understated and genuine, even though the situational focus of the film is very intense. The story also challenges the viewers to think about what they would do, if confronted with such a situation.This movie deserves a much wider audience, because it addresses a fundamental notion about whether an ordinary person, even a conflicted teenager, can rise in the face of genuine adversity, to do an extraordinary and larger good.Highly recommended!",Run Hide Fight

The protagonist's connection to her parents was very genuine and heartfelt.",Run Hide Fight
1340,chillindude-65593,"Emotionally Driven: Beat Expectations, Plotholes Aside",8,10 February 2021,"Only the best thrillers lack plotholes and plot armor, but this film is comparable in that regard to most modern action flicks. What surprised me is how invested I got in the characters (even though I thought Zoe was pretty unlikable at first). I thought they brought in Zoe's emotional trauma and character growth in pretty seamlessly, considering the film is otherwise mostly engrossed in action or suspense.Another element I thought the film handled well was more or less getting the dialogue right. I don't mean in terms of the quality of the writing and it being super meaningful and plot driven so much as I mean it felt real. As a 21 year old, too often I see movies that somehow can never get right how high schoolers talk to each other these days. But in this movie, it all felt pretty real which helped me emotionally connect with the characters.The action is amazing, really captures the suspense without getting off tempo.Was the paranoid schizophrenia depiction a bit over the top? Yep. Were there a million reasons the school shooters plan shouldn't have worked? Yep. Were the cops a little too dopey (as another reviewer said)? Yep. Were the school lockers magically bulletproof? Yep. But this movie isn't Primer. It definitely benefitted from trading off some elements of realism in exchange for a better action flick experience and for a deeper emotional feeling.Not sure if it has a ton of rewatchability, but I sure do look forward to seeing Isabel Mae (Zoe) in future performances. Her expression and physicality added a lot to the suspense of the film, complemented by subtle yet effective cinematography, editing, color grading, and set design.To point out the obvious, this is the first movie produced by The Daily Wire, a conservative news outlet headed in part by the contraversial Ben Shapiro. I was worried the movie was going to really propagandize too much, but was pleasantly surprised to see the conservative messaging limited to a few quips about helpless security guards and big tech. I was really happy to see the main messaging of the movie communicating the importance of deeper human traits like how to deal with pain, how to cope with loss, and how to stand up for others and do what's right in spite of your pain.I'd rate it higher but they didn't show the implied nudity. 8/10",Run Hide Fight
1341,deb_boffey,Mostly Fantastic!,9,10 February 2021,"Beginning with the characters - the main characters were complex, real, believable and I was able to immediately pull them close to my heart and root for them; or, with the villains, want them overtaken. The relationships between the characters were well written and extremely well acted. Great story, raw and real!
My criticism mainly involves the lesser characters. The police could have been more realistically represented in that they came off more inept than is true in real life, The teacher who allowed the main character to continue in her fight to protect the other students would have been more believable if she had fought back against her putting herself in danger. In real life a teacher should have more inner conflict with the idea of letting a student she is charged with protecting take such a role. The parents surrounding the school would have been more believable if they had been more panicked.
My only other criticism involves the last scene. When the attack on the school was over, you had the sense that all was finally well, full heart, justice done. Everything will be fine. Then, she did what she did, justifiably in our emotions; but, based on that final act, she would now be arrested. Shocking, my emotions went to dark! Happily ever after was destroyed. I so wish she would have informed and let the police do what she did.Overall, I thought it was powerful, beautiful, very well cast and acted.",Run Hide Fight

1344,tflo-60300,"It's very good, it's not for everyone.",9,11 February 2021,"This is not a pump you up hero movie. It's gritty, pretty graphic and it ranges from quiet to intense. There are a lot of reviews here that complain about character development, well it is there. Like I said it's not a hero movie, it's not a ""how some girl becomes a super hero"" movie. It's got characters who have real lives and real problems, like real people. You get the backstory but it's not a super hero back story. The movie isn't about the back story, it's about the event, the people involved and how they act under the circumstances. This is more like a disaster film then a shoot em up gun slinger tough guy flick. No one handles weapons like they know how because they're all kids, some people panic, some freeze, some step up. The bad guys are bat feces crazy in a believable way, they aren't super villains. It's not a perfect movie, locker doors don't stop bullets, even pistol bullets, but hey we pretend that walls stop bullets and guns with silencers make chirping sounds while firing supersonic rounds in every other movie so we can't be too harsh. As far as gunshots not being heard in a high school sized cinder block building, that's actually pretty accurate. If you're in the next room you hear a thud, 3 rooms away it's barely audible and you can barely feel it. Shooting from the prone from grass into a 2nd floor window, well there's a reason snipers look for elevated positions. So it's not perfect but had the writers written in an exotic metal shield that bounces around like a pool ball and always returns to the thrower like a magic boomerang no one would blink an eye, so ya know... get over it. It's not a feel good movie but it's solid entertainment, and you're gonna think about it afterward.",Run Hide Fight

Don't listen to the critics because this movie wasn't meant for their approval. Gun violence especially in our school is a touchy subject but this movie managed to get around that and still deliver a compelling story. It doesn't tell the viewer what to think or not to think.

1364,poochpg,Really good 1st film out of the gate👍🇺🇸,8,13 February 2021,"I was curious what a first time film would look like and was very impressed.STORY & ACTORS...
The actors did a great job, the story line, events and effects were believable.I loved the side story of her speaking to her mother and watching her memory of her mother grow stronger and heal as Cloe found her own strength.The messaging about what it feels like emotionally and psychologically when people are bullied/targeted, and how that can drastically affect their outlooks and perspectives about themselves and others.It was good story and important to showcase the reality, the shock, the trauma, and the fear of a situation like that. It effectively showed how easy it is to be manipulated by a simple few and had they collectively bum rushed those few, they could have overpowered them. (Eric Greitens book The Heart & The Fist does a fabulous job of showing how our own fear/minds undermine us.....script for your next project perhaps:)FILMING & EDITS...
Camera angles were good, the coloring/tone of the film leaned dim (less 'bright') with overtones of green/gray. it 'felt' like it took place on an overcast cloudy day. Not sure if intentional to set the emotional stage, and it didn't bother me, just an observation. But it was prolific throughout the film.The only constructive comments address the edits stitching the story line together to tell the story. That part was not always fluid, and comparatively felt similar to watching a movie compiled in the 80's, or a foreign film.
We (the collective movie audience) have grown accustomed to the ""Hollywood"" blockbuster film full of jump cuts and fast action pushing the viewer along. This does not in any way imply there was anything wrong with RUN HIDE FIGHT, it was nice to see the story unfold, but if the plan is to stake a claim into this market, the product will need to compete and operate at the same caliber (no pun intended) and frequency of current movie experience expectations.This past weekend I watched Star Trek III The Wrath of Kahn, and then Star Trek Into Darkness. Both fantastic movies, but clearly a stark difference between the older film and the newer.In closing - YOU DID A GREAT JOB. I'm very much looking forward to your next project, especially with Gina Carano. I've never met her, but I had worked at two of her families casinos for years. Hometown pride, So grateful you picked her up!And Ben- thank you for what you do, keep fighting the fight. Your pragmatic voice of reason and drilling down to the truth - not shades of personal truths, but the actual truth - is critical in such concerning times.Thank you Daily Wire - Xxoo",Run Hide Fight

1366,tonyadoolittle,My review,10,13 February 2021,Only reason why this would get bad review cause people don't want their kids to see realityPeople don't even want to see it themselves And they think this will help a shooter before a shooter realizes what he or she has done and feels bad about it would be after he's killed people They will regret it only after the thrill and when it's to late So no it's not a bad thing for people or future killers to see this This doesn't teach them anything wrong accept the recording part they might want to be seen or heard but it's shouldn't be that way even popular people aren't seen and heard or teased whether it's in the future or at home no ones life is perfect no one should kill because their sad depressed hurt teased or for no reason there's always that one person that loves even if it's yourself being different means your unique there's no one entirely like you that's how God mad us Now I loved this movie it teaches children not to be scared but to help before you or someone ends up dead you can save a life I wouldn't say go after someone with a weapon but there's ways to hide like the ceiling that's also a way to travel throughout the school but the doors being bolted were excellent Such a brave girl Brave actors here but I won't spoil what happens further with the killers dad And the police etc thanks,Run Hide Fight

1388,beckertroy-12618,Solid Movie,9,15 February 2021,"I'm a pretty harsh critic, so getting anything over 7 stars is a rarity from me. To get the bad out of the way... there were a few (very few) cliche moments in the beginning and end, and a few times where the acting or character motivation... eh, kind of fell short.And, since I'm a stickler on these things, some of the gun physics were off. Bullets would have flown right through that (spoiler alert) and unless the were incendiary rounds, don't make sparks like that. Or that click-chick sound when you pick it up. But I have to say, compared to most movies, even those fake things were pretty minor.So, honestly, that's all I can say bad about the movie. Which, again, is pretty good, if you know me. There was action that felt very real. The movie didn't pull punches. The villain was perhaps a tiny bit shallow, but actually pretty good. A believable mastermind smartass kid who was out to... well, watch the movie.The hero was a fun-to-watch badass, and in the right way. Not some scrawny girl (which she was, very petite) who can someone one-punch knockout a large grown man, but who instead used what she had to win. Nothing drives me crazier in today's movies than that overly fake attempt at gritty action, and this movie just did it better. Well done.Other than that, the plotting was good, the characterization of even the minor characters good (even Louis made me laugh), and the whole thing with her mom was very well executed.All in all, I give it an 8.5- rounded up to a 9 because IMDB won't let me do decimals.And I'm the harsh critic. The wife yelled at the TV multiple times, so she was totally into it. And action movies aren't her thing.Definitely worth a watch.",Run Hide Fight

The lead actress did a terrific -- and believable -- job in a difficult role. Script was mostly airtight and the direction -- always a challenge with high school-age actors -- was remarkable. None of the characters did anything so stupid that you thought, ""Yeah, that would never happen."" Most importantly, it was a good lesson about how cowering in place isn't always the best approach. Completely predictable that reviewers -- the kind of folks who break into a cold sweat at the mere sight of a firearm -- would pan this.

But I was hugely impressed with the writing, acting, abd production value in RHF.The story is believable, and progresses with relatable characters. And Zoe is a true hero we can all love to the surprise final scene.I'd prefer a few less f-bombs...but it was a real life reflection of the culture we are in, so I don't fault them for it.

They did a pretty good job tackling a modernly relevant (and touchy) topic, while not glamorizing it. It was a bit over the top in some areas, but otherwise generally believable (I mean, it *IS* the world of make-believe hollywood after all). The characters could use some more development (especially the father/daughter dynamic), although that did make for a more streamlined film without distracting sub plots. Nevertheless, the acting was pretty good overall (the character of Lewis was well done) and the female protagonist wasn't forced on the viewer, her grit and determination was foreshadowed well.Everyone is entitled to their own opinion, but sheesh there are tons of reviews just bashing this movie.

Then the haters who seemed too smart for some of their actions in the end. One thing that most movie goers realize is that someone in editing forgot to edit the actual mentality of the character beginning to end. Would the freak killer character who killed his mother with no reason, and hated so many others (without reason) however he planned where the police would be, the fire dept would be, the actions of the swat team. Would he really just walk out of the building in front of everyone? Wouldnt he walk out the back door, possibly? also, wouldnt he get far away as possible in case he was spotted and followed? (like he was. lol) before opening and examining what he put in the box? Also, how was the ""Angel"" allowed to get her dad's gun that was ""evidence"" and kill him then talk to him for a long period of time without any of the many many police and swat team noticing? Are the police and swat team really blind? I wish the ending was more realistic as the beginning seemed to be.
Please do not get me wrong. I literally paid $108 to join the DW just to basically watch this movie. As a defender of gun rights and our constitution, I believe this movie could be used to open the minds of those that dont understand the reality of needing gun safety in our schools. I believe there should be classes offered to students (with parents permission) in high school to learn gun safety.

As it's the first movie from The Daily Wire, I didn't expect it to surpass what I consider a ""par"" movie. It did... by a lot. In an age where actors/actresses are praised for mediocrity in films that take no risk, these actors took great risk to their careers by entering into this venture. I'm grateful for their risk and to the Daily Wire for it's effort to bring film into a more neutral space when it could have tried to shove some ideology down the watcher's throat. It wasn't about right or left... it was about what can happen. The film leaves it to the watcher to decide the politics of it.

While the movie is both gripping and suspenseful, it glances over issues such as locking kids in classrooms to await their death and school bullying. I thought these areas should have been explored in more detail. The intervening ""Moma ghost"" took up valuable time and frankly contributed little to advancing the topic at hand. While there's no doubt that the heroic efforts of the main character saved many lives, it was at times unbelievable. While I agree with the theme, the execution was frankly lacking.

Despite the dark nature of the story, it does a good job of spotlighting the heroes that arise to fight the darker forces in the film.

While I am usually not a fan of gory movies I still couldn't turn my eyes away. It went for realism more than just rough to be rough and sensational. That made it better for me. It certainly keeps you on the edge of your seat and brings to mind all of our fears of finding ourselves in a similar situation where you come face to face with pure evil. It made me ponder man's innate desire to survive, help others, and to seek justice while trying to find meaning in the madness. I found myself pondering the actions various characters took in the movie. I think what made it the most thoughtful for me was that it didn't tell me which was right and wrong but left me to decide for myself.

Found out about it from a friend, this beats the pants of most high production blockbusters in terms of character development, audience connection, and of course action.

1478,louiedak,Way better than critics are saying it is!,8,25 February 2021,"First off, I will be upfront in saying I am a conservative person. With that said, I am such a movie fan that I will not let that blind my efforts to be honest in reviewing a movie for what it is. I have no problem saying that Daily Wire Productions failed... But they didn't! I was shocked when I saw the critics reviews vs the users reviews and told myself I needed to see this to formulate my own opinion to determine which side had it right. Needless to say, I was utterly disappointed in the critics and their blatant disregard toward being a professional and instead standing for a political position. I have seen movies out of Hollywood that were more conservative than this one, but yet still for some reason critics have it all wrong.The truth is, this is no Christopher Nolan, Martin Scorsese, or Disney level production with a quarter of a billion dollars at their disposal for the best music, graphics, actors, sets, props, and writing. However, in the same way that Taken, Deadpool, and other low budget hits captured audiences attention with truly heart racing suspense and entertainment - Run Hide Fight did just that. The lead, Isabel May, was amazing! In fact, she was leaps and bounds better than the trash Disney hired to play Rey in Star Wars Force Awakens. This movie was no religious cult slap in the face, no trump shouting MAGA film, no Gun raving or right wing agenda items. It was simply Die Hard in a school.... It was fun, exciting, heart warming, and I liked it. My only complaint was the prehistoric weapons deployed by the antagonists... Like a breach load double barrel and a machine gun from my great grandfathers day was a disappointment in the realism department when we all know kids would go get an AR15 off the street.",Run Hide Fight

Yes, terrible things happen in the world, because man is inherently evil, but there will always be good people there to fight that evil.

Hard to watch innocent people being murdered; but perhaps that needs to be seen to appreciate the brutality when it happens in real life. Critics called it mindless because it didn't mention gun control, but I think it clearly sends a message about the terrorists' desire for fame and the part we play in it with our obsession of 24hr news and social media. I read one review that said it portrays school shooters as bullied, narcissistic kids with mental illness, without delving into the deeper issues of poverty and inequality (what?!). I think that review says it all haha. Truly awesome thriller, just enjoy it for what it is.",Run Hide Fight

That could not be more false, it was sensitive where it needed to be, had intelligent and real characters, and was inclusive throughout.

With a little bit of additional backing from the major film corporations who turned their back on this film, it could have been something even better, but perhaps this is why it was enjoyable. It wasn't your typical Hollywood polished, same-old-same-old that left you as empty as the 5 buck bag of popcorn you left the cinema with. I've seen plenty of big budget films that have flopped badly, and this film for whatever the budget may have been, even with a few flaws & holes in it, seemed to work very well on the back of some great acting.",Run Hide Fight

It was quite graphic, but through these displays of unadulterated violence, the viewer was placed in the position where the front page of the newspaper took on a tangible meaning. The blood of high schoolers in the film and the lack of any cohesive defense on the part of the school forces one to re-evaluate any preconceived notions or apathy on the subject.

It might not cater to the liberal media and establishment politics, but it adds to a more realistic story that is worth while. It's not a political movie.

I was really excited to watch the movie and see what competition to Hollywood would look like. The production value was solid. I think they did a really good job portraying the villain, and a lot of his lines were great. The dead mother was honestly my favorite part of the movie. Some of what she said was honestly prophetic: her speechs about her dying 1000 times in her daughters head and about letting go of dead loved ones brought a tear to my eye if I were honest. I also really love the character arch with the school shooter that switches sides. What makes this movie a 6/10 and not a 10/10 is the ending. Its honestly disappointing. They had this beautiful arch with her best friend/ lover about him being a wimp that was introduced in the first few mins of the story. He then proceeds to strike out with zoe, and follow the school shooter around the whole time broadcasting his message to the world. I thought that he would eventually grow a pair and fight for the woman he loved and make up for his wrongs, but he ends up getting shot and being carried out on a stretcher. It is very hard to believe a woman as strong as zoe would be in love with the shooters social media director (seriously, how does one of the shooters have a better character arch then him?!). They should have had him make some heroic act to save zoe and give his life for the woman he loved. Instead the ending is zoe sniping the lead villian as he tries to escape, and leaving him to bleed out. Now, this scene is honestly so lack-luster compatible with the rest of the movie. She shoots him, but he survives. She is then about to put him out of his misery like she did to the elk in the beginning of the movie, but chooses to let him bleed to death. Now, don't get me wrong, it is definitely what he deserved, but does the ending message of the movie have to be school shooters are the worst people alive and deserve no mercy? I feel like that is something everyone besides a school shooter agrees with. Now zoe, the hero of the story, comes off as a vindictive person making a point to make him feel the most pain possible for really no reason (no real plot reason). It's just kinda disappointing that that was the note they chose to end the movie on. Having some heart-felt dying words with her best friend about prom after he saves, and then having her just stay strong until she is back with her father is how I would have ended it. I honestly think the ending takes the movie from a beautiful piece about fighting for whats right and love to just something thats just about how bad the villain was.",Run Hide Fight
1559,jwbeck-28961,If you are not someone obsessed with messaging you will love this movie,10,22 March 2021,"This movie checks all the boxes of a action movie.

1561,wesleysparrish,Strongly Emotional. Meaningful. Real-World Gritty.,10,22 March 2021,"A truly thrilling movie in every sense of the word. Every scene has you silently rooting for the protagonist, Zoey. The complex motivations of Zoey are well thought out and diverse. The antagonists are also very well thought out, not shown as simply one-dimensional murderers but instead as hurting and sometimes ill-minded kids with a wide array of motivations. You even feel for the side characters that are victims of the shooters. The exploration of the media's role in glamourizing school shootings is also explored in depth in a realistic way. The struggle of the police and school staff to untangle the mess of policy and real-world risks is centered often.
Overall this is a gritty and yet somewhat hopeful thriller that explores school shootings in a way that is refreshing but also tragic, with a protagonist that is well-acted and well-written.",Run Hide Fight

1567,harperjosh-05336,Return to good guy beats bad guy.,9,30 March 2021,Like they made a realistic hero movie well realistic as movies go. Better than Hollywood. Anyways also like that this was a good guy vs bad guy and the hero who is not made to be over qualified for the situation handles it well. Also like that they made it female hero. First one I saw that was done right Hollywood usually make female heroes unrealisticly over qualified for the problem. Also love they left the politics out and didn't force political view into the movie. Only wish they would have cleared the secondary story line of the parent and police result at the end. But is not needed for main theme and may be intended as a supplemental cliff hanger.,Run Hide Fight

It did have very good acting and the plot was good, if a little hard to believe at times. It has a very good pace, and keeps you on the edge of your seat throughout.

The director makes some questionable angling decisions with the camera that a keen person might notice. It was clear that the messaging could have been more clear as well.All that being said, it was an excellent film. The film critics appear to openly admit the primary reason for their rating being negative was political with comments like ""Tasteless given the political climate"", ""grotesque exploitation of tragedy"", and ""tone deaf politically"" being the primary complaints listed. These also being hypocritical given their absolute adoration of politically exploiting tragedy when it suits them...

1585,ksqgk,Disappointed with Hollywood,9,7 May 2021,"As a Veteran and a LEO, it's hard to watch any movie without nitpicking at certain actions, scenes and actors. The production could have put more concentration on the first responders actions and acting. Also the ridiculousness that no one in the school heard a van crash into the cafeteria or heard any gunshots. Even in the smallest of small, ""out in the boonies"", type of schools, you're going to faculty walking around in the halls or a class room near by. Other then that, the plot was really good, not many cinematic movies made about an active shooter on active threat. There was some great references to actual Active Shooter Cases, which brought on a reality to this fictional movie. The main character, Isabel May, made an amazing performance, especially scene that made her stand out, like the chemistry class scene, where she was the only one who didn't jump during the explosion of the balloon. To be the main actor among highly know actors like, Thomas Jane and Treat Williams; just a outstanding performance.I really don't know why Hollywood didn't want to pick this movie up. I didn't see anything that was the dreadfulness of being ""Politically Correct"". People in Hollywood need to leave their Bubbles of their million dollar mansion and vacation home, step away from reaching on a computer and go out into the real world of everyday life; maybe then they can learn what everyone else in the world goes through. Might even make better movies.Great work to The Daily Wire and all who helped bring this movie to light. I look forward to watching more.One more thing. Hopefully big name companies would stop being so damn political so a company like The Daily Wire could premier entertainment on anywhere like the Google store and cable/satellite companies.",Run Hide Fight

My fiancé said she thought it was a pretty slow build to the main action of the movie but I actually enjoyed the character progression that it allowed as well as the fact that it makes it feel more realistic versus being a movie with unnecessary explosions and impossible ""David (or Zoe) vs. Goliath"" fights.

Acting was incredible so much so that all of the characters didn't seem fake or cliche. Each individual came across pure and you could see where their genuine motivations came from not a single one for me was distracting away from the story. Plot was gripping and not trying to force a narrative down your throat which was refreshing to me and allowed me to sink further into the movie as a passenger in the vehicle. Budget was low but similar to titles like Blair Witch, Deadpool, or A Quiet Place. Such that when you have a committed group creating their vision for you to see all on the same page then magic can happen. The movie is about the bravery of the individuals in the movie but the entire cast also came up brave and delivered on something most would pass on because a great director, script, and production crew. I look forward to more independent films returning to make an impact in entertainment and a story to tell instead of the factory forced 1984 agendized and over produced meh it was okay movies.

1616,jonwood-75509,Excluding politics it is a great film,9,27 June 2021,"From the security standpoint and what people should do in the event of an active shooter this really is a good film. It is very practical with very little Hollywood exaggeration. It illustrates quite well just how ineffective a lot of the policy implementations are (i.e unarmed security, not drilling procedures, dependency on centralized controls,etc). If school boards looked at this film they could honestly mitigate a lot of the potential losses by taking a real practical approach but unfortunately the entire conversation has become about gun control and not about how to harden these soft targets. This film used real world examples of what has occurred (which active shooters do) and created a good story with a main character that you could genuinely like and root for. It wasn't very far fetched outside of the MP40 machine gun which I think was a bit silly but not a movie ruiner. The tools used by the villains in real world would likely be what they could actually acquire and getting a highly regulated and obscenely expensive weapon like a genuine MP40 is not exactly plausible but my guess is the directors didn't want this film to get hijacked by the ban all scary guns crowd so they avoided the AK or AR platforms for the villains. None of the main characters actions were far fetched. The bad guys were a little textbook but it wasn't too distracting imho and the lead bad guy was well executed. The only thing that I didn't really like was the very end which I won't ruin but overall was very excellent.

I have to wonder if these are the same people who blamed Columbine on M Manson because his music was too violent? This entire movie is a revenge fantasy about ""taking matters into your own hands."" The same crowd that sings the praises of the blue line cheer a movie where police look like bumbling idiots.

Unless it is so bad I can't finish it that is.This rarely happens but I came away from this film completely amazed. I had no idea who Isabel May was prior to seeing this flick and wow does she turn in a performance. When people make the comparison to Die Hard it's fairly accurate, right down to the trauma the main character takes and is forced to deal with throughout the film. She doesn't show battle damage but some how spin kicks on a shot up leg like most modern action films, she has to hobble her way around and it's a bit more pronounced as the movie goes on. Granted there are some Hollywood-style touches here that likely wouldn't hold. For example: a school locker door stopping a 9mm round seems unlikely. But they are few.I did not expect to like this film this much.

This includes both ""GD"" and ""JC"". I understand that it is pervasive in our modern culture, but it's offensive to many ears and didn't serve the story in any way- i.e. the use of these phrases was clearly not meant as a device to further develop the characters.

1692,rkirkham,Die Hard Goes to High School,8,28 January 2021,"I will let others get involved if they want with the genesis of this movie. I don't care where it came from, I only know that it is a terrifically tense thriller that seems appropriate for the times. Inevitably it will be compared to ""Die Hard"", but that's OK because the hero in the movie is a lot like John McClane. She is reluctant but resolved. She pushes herself and does so while recognizing the punishment she has to go through. There is an emotional epiphany for her that is prompted by her circumstances but needed to be arrived at regardless of the trigger. Zoe Hull may not have the wise cracking persona of Lt. McClane, but she does have the spirit of defiance and the recognition that even though the people she is trying to protect are not all her favorites, they deserve to have someone on their side.The scenario is simple, which is one of the reasons the story works. A school shooting has started and depressed senior Zoe is caught in the middle of the events. Isabel May plays Zoe, a girl who is in denial of how much her grief at the loss of her mother to cancer recently, is poisoning. her life. The relationship she has with her father, a gruff but loving Thomas Jane, is being tested by her recalcitrance. He has tried to teach her basic skills, including hunting, which might be appropriate for a girl growing up in a farming community in Indiana. Her best friend Lewis, has deeper feelings toward her but she puts up a defensive wall that makes warmth difficult. There are teachers concerned enough to make an effort to reach out to her, but they too are rebuffed. It is the sudden striking act of violence that begins to awaken her to what she may be losing out on.The movie is not for the faint of heart. It opens with a scene that features hunting and the reality of that activity is not really minimized. Some might question it's inclusion but it is needed to show Zoe is capable of taking a violent action herself, and it also sets up a payoff that we will see coming later on. The takeover of the school cafeteria and the ensuing execution of students is even more brutal. It is not glamorized or played just for gore. The four perpetrators are shown to be merciless and indiscriminate in their dealing out instant death. In older style movies, some measure of hesitation might be shown by the gang of misanthropes, but here it is casual without consideration of consequences or emotions. The lack of character background for the victims is mostly a function of story efficiency rather than weak writing. This is not a disaster film where we are hanging on the edge of our seats praying for characters we have come to love. Instead we are shown more about the culture than the individuals, because these school shooters are millennial bumps with social media as their primary teacher.The leader of this troop of monsters is Tristan Voy, a school misfit played by Eli Brown. He certainly does not have the charisma of Hans Gruber, but in these circumstances, he does stand out as a villain worth of our hate. Ultimately, the satisfaction we derive from having a revenge fueled action picture like this, is proportionate to the degree of loathing we have for the main antagonist. Tristan's casual indifference to the emotions of his classmates, along with the capricious decisions about when and who to kill are probably enough to justify our eventual reactions. He is however shown to be a sociopath in a couple of other ways, including the humiliation of the principal, the Spanish teacher and the security guard. His manipulation of the other three attackers is also going to give us some reasons to loath him. Social media fame fuels his narcistic ego, but it also makes the community of viewers accomplices to the horror that we are witnessing.The title of the film actually comes from the simple training that students are given in real classrooms today. Because an active shooter incident is such a noticeable event, despite it's remote possibility, schools now require student training. My last three years in the classroom required an annual lockdown exercise, that included the paraphrase of directions, first run if you can, second hide if needed, and finally fight if you must. It is the transition from running to fighting that forms the story arc for Zoe. She has an internal monologue with her Mother, and Mom gives her the advice and encouragement she already knows she needs to follow. Zoe's acts of heroism and resistance, undermine Tristan's goals, not just the plan. So while he and Zoe do not share the repartee that John McClane and Hans Gruber did, we can see why she would be such an annoyance to him.
The nature of the training and the procedures become a tool for the shooters. School administrations are tied up in policies. Teachers are reluctant to change from the established procedure, even when an alternative is called for, and of course students are responding emotionally to what is happening to them. Lewis does not become a pivotal player because of his actions, but rather his social media. Zoe rediscovers her empathy and that helps her manage a problem and turn it into a tool to her benefit. The climax of the picture does involve some of the movie make believe that all such stories require. Dad's reemergence into the story, and Zoe's suddenly strong peripheral vision are shortcuts to the end, but the intervening tension has been more than sufficient to forgive some of that.The movie does have things to say about our culture and the schools. The police do not come in for the criticism they might deserve after the incident a couple of years ago in Florida. The police chief played by veteran actor Treat Williams, is a sympathetic character who hates being forced to operate in the conditions that are presented, but he does manage to find a way to adapt. The news media also gets a bit of a shellacking for the emphasis on the sensational that drives their coverage. So this is another beat lifted from ""Die Hard"" which is moderated a bit but still relevant.In summary, this is a violent action thriller that takes pride in the difference one person can make. It understands the ambivalence many students have to their high school experience, but also how important some of those experiences can be in building us as people. Best of all, it provides the action and emotion beats that a thriller like this needs to keep an audience glued to the seat. I really liked it.",Run Hide Fight

Yesterday I was looking for something to watch and came across Run, Hide, Fight on the Daily Wire app.Well, I was very surprised.

It is a tear jerker for me, but my husband didn't cry.The whole movie is about the build up of her character and you do feel vested in her and her relationships.

1714,strith,Eminently entertaining!,10,15 January 2021,"This movie has everything there is to want in a great movie. It is brilliantly written, filmed, and performed. The story is heart stoppingly intense with outstanding acting from all involved. The characters seem real and flawed in all the right (or in some cases wrong) ways to make them seem real and believable. The action is intense, but in such a way as to still seem real and believable, there are no MacGyver's or John McLane's to save the day, just real people standing up in the face of imminent danger. I saw aspects of people I know in every character, good and bad. Watched as a film for entertainment it excels!If you are of a liberal mindset, stop reading here and go enjoy the movie as a phenomenal and entertaining film. But the value doesn't stop there, the film is shown from a perspective that seldom gets light in present day Hollywood. It presents an outstanding story and film portrayed from a perspective that resonates with conservative values. Appreciation for traditional family and friends, the value of relationships without regard to race or other ""defining"" features, respect for nature without a pagan-like worship of it, acceptance of Christian values and faith, a general refusal to submit to the necessary tokenism and mandates of the left, and so many more. That's not to say that this film isn't diverse. The casting shows a fair representation of a typical U.S. community, just not to fill quotas and feel woke. There is nothing unnatural about the characters, they don't seem written in to meet a requirement as is so often the case, there isn't someone of each race, gender, etc. thrown in to ensure they are covered. Each casting choice seems clearly led by excellent talent and focus on the intention of the story.I can't wait for the folks at The Daily Wire to take their next foray into filmmaking. My only complaint is that I couldn't see this on the big screen. I'm crossing my fingers that the next one might appear there.",Run Hide Fight
1715,jul-paris,Die hard at school,8,26 January 2021,"School shootings are indeed a gloomy topic, and I was not excepting much from such a synopsis : either a copycat Elephant-like depressing movie, or worst, a dumb teenage movie with guns. But it's definitely a take an Die Hard, somehow smarter with this setup. Think about it : replace Bruce Willis by a teenage girl, keep the terrorists but frame them not as foreigners but fellow students, a tower by a school, and you got what a smart Die Hard could be (or at least a contemporary one). Genuine, action-filled, thrilling, believable characters, and weirdly positive... Yippie-ki-yay, I'm the first to be surprised !",Run Hide Fight
1716,edarthjac,"Not a perfect movie, but what is?",8,26 August 2021,"I have watched this film 3 times. Honestly, I have enjoyed it almost equally each time. Without spoiling too much, this is a movie with more going on than might first meet the eye. On the surface it is essentially, as others have mentioned, Die Hard in a high school. A group of mentally needy teens, lead by a Joker-like, leader who sees himself as superior to all, take a high-school hostage. A young woman, who is not dealing well with the loss of her mother to cancer, finds herself in a unique position to become a thorn in the side of this group. On that level alone the film is fairly successful. The acting is believable, the cinematography contrasts between hauntingly beautiful to grittily stark.There is also a very personal element to the story regarding the leading lady, Zoe Hull intensely portrayed by Isabel May. She lost her mother to cancer and is not dealing with it well. Through the course of the events in the film, Zoe has several encounters with the memory of her mother, empathetically played by Radha Mitchell. These moments were some of my favorites.This is not a film for children. On Daily Wire it is rated TVMA, but if it were released theatrically, it would be a definite R. The action is intense and vivid. The story does not hold back. Bad things happen, and they happen on screen, for the most part.As the title of my review states, this is not a perfect film. There are a few things about the story that may not be entirely true to life, but that is true of many films. Those moments are few enough that I did not find them taking me out of the story. Even the bent barrel on a rubber prop gun did not bother me. I didn't even notice it until it was pointed out to me. One of the moments that I did not think fit exactly was the very ending. I won't give it away. There was a certain forced poetry to it, but I think it could have been handled a bit better. The moment is what some might have wanted to happen, but in reality would not have gone the way it did in the film. I hope that doesn't put anyone off of the film. In the end, I really enjoyed it, all 3 times I have watched it... so far.",Run Hide Fight

1719,TNA-Sting_Fan,Awesome Movie,10,15 August 2021,"Run Hide Fight (2020) directed by Kyle Rankin, was such a great movie and here is why. Let's look at the cast. Thomas Jane and Isabel May. Terrific casting. Isabel May was the best choice for Zoe Hull and to find out why all one needs to do is watch. Another plus is that this film was distributed by The Daily Wire. It is a respected organization. Run Hide Fight tells a good story and one all schools and teachers should watch. School shootings have sadly become a big part of American history. So has terrorism occurred in other places. The story digs deeper and develops the characters showing why they make the choices they do. Zoe Hull is a girl who has had it tough. Due to the loss of a loved one she has shut herself off. Not caring about trivial high school things, giving up her cell phone, and the things that make teenagers click. Still, she goes hunting with her father and is good at using guns. Her best friend Lewis wants to be more than friends and wants to go to the prom with her. Zoe is not interested and is upset. Tristan Voy leads the group of high school terrorists. Triston is a troubled kid who was denied help. Kip Quade has a long history of having been bullied and is a member of Tristan's team. Another teammate, Chris Jelick, hears voices. His crazy sister, Anna Jelick, was also on the team. Let's note that even though Zoe herself was troubled, she was not capable of terrorism like the others. With the school held hostage and people being killed it is up to Zoe to try and rescue everybody. This thriller shows what would happen in this situation if only one or more people carried guns with them at school.",Run Hide Fight

The trailer for the movie looked intense, gritty, and honest and I loved the line offered by the protagonist about who would be remembered.This was not a movie glorifying violence, it was a movie about determination, about loss, and about human decency. Movies like this can be uncomfortable and as a parent I worried plenty about school place violence in all it's forms. This movie really high-lighted how people can arrive to a point where they are willing to do very bad things. It also highlights how good people can stand by their values, grow in their resolve, and do what's right and not what's easy.I have no idea why some sites are rating the movie down. The production value was very high and the acting was frankly, amazing.

There is just enough character development and backstory to draw you in without being overbearing, and it is weaved in throughout the movie, not dumped in all at once using exposition. Amazingly written and directed, you wouldn't be able to tell this was an indie vs a big production. Actually scratch that, a big production studio would have ruined this story. And I'm amazed at how well these young actors performed. I was expecting at least a little bit of cheesyness or over-acting, but they were all on-point and incredibly convincing.

It follows Zoe as she struggles in dealing with the recent loss of her mother while having to confront the darkest evils of humanity.While the subject matter is disturbing, as it intends to be, it does not cross the line into being exploitative. The film dares to dive into some dark subject matter that is ""off-limits"" for some, but in no way glorifies the horrific acts of the villainous characters of the film. On the contrary, it highlights the bravery of those forced to deal with the situation while commenting on the limitations of teachers, police and rescuers. The authority figures are doing their best to help while following their protocol, but Zoe recognizes that the villains are using this to their advantage and quickly adapts to the realities of the situation as it unfolds.The film is an engaging thriller from beginning to end with terrific performances all around.

1759,dcllamas2,Could've been better,6,18 January 2021,"There's a few odd moments that brought me out of movie. 1.) When the frizzy head shooter goes into the bathroom and somehow doesn't see Zoe go in the ceiling. 2.) When the cop walks out slightly on fire and just dies. 3.) When the security guard dies from the explosion even though he was a decent distance away. 4.) When the girl shooter doesn't see Zoe and Zoe just pops out of a really weird spot in the balloon room. 5.) When Zoe throws something to distract the shaved head shooter and he somehow doesn't see her. 6.) But probably the worst thing that really hurt the movie for me is when Zoe goes and picks up her Dad's rifle without anyone knowing, and then kills Tristin without anyone noticing (which is just straight murder at that point and she'd be going to jail). If these moments didn't exist or were filmed better, I would give this movie a way higher rating.

This was like Die Hard in a high school, with lead character Zoe as our kick ass action hero. I really liked how Zoe wasn't some Rambo-type, though, she won by her skills and her wits. It was also good to see the plot portray the shooters as true villains rather than transform them into sympathetic characters. In one scene, Zoe even rips into one of the villains for trying to justify what he's done. ""They're going to remember me!"" was one of those iconic action movie lines that made this film so memorable and makes me want to watch it again.

They don't make them like this anymore because everything these days is pushing some sort of political agenda.But this movie really just focuses on character and I think expresses what would happen in such a situation. It's a bit graphic considering there are school shooters, but I believe this is needed to grip the attention of people and see what would happen in situation like this. Definitely recommend this to anyone, it's a great thriller!Thank you Daily Wire, for making this possible. I'm excited to see what else is to come.

The production value was great, AND the storytelling was great. For me, the best part of the film was the discussion between Zoe and Kip while Kip was zip tied. Zoe getting to the heart of why Kip was doing what he was doing and destroying his reasoning was amazing.Also, the visions of her mother were powerful without being cheesy. I didn't realize her mother was dead in the kitchen scene at the start of the movie but once I knew she was dead I thought, I need to watch this again.Being a father, I loved Thomas Jane's character and when he shot that kid I fist pumped in the air.

Undeserving of critic bashing,8,22 February 2021,"I expected Run Hide Fight to take obvious political positions that would explain the critic's hatred of it, but it never did. I also expected subpar acting and cinematography to accompany a comparatively small budget, but both were excellent. I could only identify one hard political stance this movie takes, and that is the pro-capital punishment position. Ironically, this particular opinion is not exclusive to the political left or right. Though most would agree the right is more pro, while the left is more for the against, it's not a clear political divide. So to label a film ""conservative"" for taking this position is somewhat asinine.

That all changed after I saw the movie. Wow! The action was tight. The suspense phenomenal. The plot moved along very well. It did pay homage/use tropes found in other movies. Also it is a bit stretched because it takes an active shooter situation (which is typically lone wolf) and turns it into a gang of misfits trying to wreck havoc. It is very gruesome and real in portraying the horrors of a school shooting. It is not for the general audience. Overall the critique I would have is they make the school as inept as possible and the heroine (like typical action movies) unbelievably resilient which does cast a slight bit of realism to the film. However, this helps enhance the bravery of the characters and sheds light on the preparation some schools have.As a parting side note there is a bit of comedic gems in the movie that does help pace the gravity of the situation and give the viewer some relief. It does not take the viewer out of the experience which was a very good balance to find",Run Hide Fight

Blame the Tool and not the person using that inanimate object. The cool thing about this movie is THERE WAS NO POLITICS IN IT! Yay! The acting in this movie was riveting and the action and plot was just great. There was a small issue with one of the prop guns in a couple of scenes but overall I give this movie 10 stars!

Most movies now out now are either about star cameos or have the Hollywood morality that oozes out trash movies with an entertainment value of zero. RUN HIDE FIGHT, however, is NOT one of those films. First, the action is continuous, keeping you on the edge of your seat pretty much from the first scene on. Second, the plot is one that is relatable...everyone probably went to High School and knew some of these characters. Granted, it's a small town school somewhere in the South, which is probably why city-'educated' professional movie reviewers can't wrap their head around it, but they also probably went to private schools and perhaps feel more sympathetic to the antagonists (particularly the voices). Third, the character development really makes the movie, especially the subject of loss, leaving High School, and taking a stand against injustice (something the reviewers actually should grasp, only this probably doesn't meet their criteria of 'injustice'). I am probably going to watch again this weekend and STRONGLY recommend this to anyone who are fans of Joker, Die Hard, The Punisher and Daredevil.",Run Hide Fight

1805,badcrc31337,"Lots of goofs and impossibilities, but entertaining nonetheless",6,14 February 2021,"If you want to be entertained and don't get hung up on details this is a good movie. Like a lot of movies, many things wouldn't make sense in real life. I wanted to rate this an 8 or 9 for entertainment, but some of the flaws are just too elementary to ignore for that rating.Though a few things in the movie didn't make sense during the movie, I found after the movie I questioned many other things. Besides the mainly minor flaws already covered, the main flaws I see are:1) No one seems to hear gunshots in the same building or even outdoor shots when people are nearby outside. As a hunter and target shooter I found that unbelievable. I can hear people target shooting many miles away with pistols. Apparently in this movie it's difficult to hear a hunting rifle a couple hundred yards away, or shotguns and rifles being fired inside a school.2) Everything seems delayed. Though everyone was calling 911, the police don't seem to get notified until much later. Though everyone has a phone and is streaming, the other classrooms don't seem to realize what's going on until much later when it's convenient for the story to move along.3) Zoe, and at the end her dad, seem to be one step ahead of all the cops at all times.4) Zoe's last action at the end doesn't seem to agree with all of her previous actions and even though looks good for a revenge theme, I don't think was justified.5) I find it hard to believe a room full of teenagers would allow one wounded kid with a revolver to hold them hostage for a length of time without at least one or two trying to stop him.6) Everyone seems a little dim-witted except Tristan, Zoe, Zoe's Dad, and her friend Lewis. The teachers and other faculty don't seem to catch on too quick to anything, and the cops just appear to be mindless drones sent to surround the school extremely late. Even when Zoe is trying to warn people, with blood all over her, they question her. Luckily during the movie I wasn't thinking too hard about it.7) Although I'm a conservative, I find it odd for a conservative outlet to champion a movie about a school massacre, and then not to take the opportunity to point out any kind of prevention or major failures that contributed to those shootings. Some people said this wasn't gory but many people were shot point blank and died bloody horrible deaths choking on their blood. I believe that's called gory. To not be gory it would pan away and you'd hear a shot.",Run Hide Fight

Assuming two sides of the argument exist: (1) Don't use weapons or resist -- follow the policy book and the authorities will handle it and some will survive; and (2) Use weapons, adapt, and resist evil to minimize death.

I'm quite disappointed to say I side with the critics.The movie should have ended with Zoe being a badass in self-defense, and the bad guy getting burned up (or getting away). A little over the top, but fine for a movie. Instead, SHE GRABS HER DAD'S SNIPER RIFLE AND ATTEMPTS MURDER. There is a difference between self-defense and vigilante justice, and it's crucial to tread that line, especially if, as is inevitable, this movie becomes a political statement by the Daily Wire. Zoe's act of seizing justice is exactly the kind of fascist impulse the Left is afraid of, and it really needs to not be legitimized this way. Conservatism is not about revenge and power, it's about justice.The overall worldview of the movie was not at all redemptive. There was a second where I thought they were going that direction with Kip, but his moment of clarity didn't have the effect of saving the character. His death could have been a noble sacrifice, and a turning point for him, but the way it was executed showed that Rankin just wanted to give the middle finger to even the most misguided and troubled school shooter.",Run Hide Fight

It feels real and the tension, once tightened, does not let up. I felt like I was watching Captain Phillips (Tom Hanks starred, Paul Greengrass directed), when I vividly recall holding my breath for what felt like 2 hours until the credits start rolling. There's a moment in that film when the adrenaline subsides and you take a breath and your emotions start flooding your senses. Run Hide Fight was intense and genuine, not letting me breathe until the credits start rolling and the adrenaline subsides. Please watch this film and don't let your preconceived notions about the subject matter cloud your judgement on the quality of the film and acting. Our protagonist, Zoe (played wonderfully by Isabel May), and our antagonist, Tristan (played menacingly by Eli Brown), both really shine as incredible characters and actors in this film.",Run Hide Fight

1836,mrandreiilles,Very likeable movie,8,24 January 2021,"Usually I don't write reviews but this movie made me write something down. I really loved it. I don't know why, but I really did. There is something about this movie, a charm of it that makes it very likeable. Of course, if you start analyzing every bit of it under the magnifier, you will find different cracks and imperfections but isn't it the same with a masterpiece painting that you are watching from very close?
So let's detach ourselves a little bit, and watch it from a certain perspective that just doesn't analyze every technical bit of it; and you will have a very good action movie. And the plot is really actual and scary about what happened already several times, maybe not in the same scenario but you've got the idea,..
I do recommend it, and, after all, why not have a feminine version of Die Hart after 40 years or so? I can't wait already seeing Run Hide Fight 2 and the team left it open for a sequel. Well done crew and the whole team.",Run Hide Fight
1837,grumpywil,"Surprisingly not bad, Don't listen to Rotten Tomatoes' Critics...EVER.",7,18 January 2021,"Just watched it last night. I was a little hesitant at first, thinking it was gonna be full of Republican politics being bashed over your head for 110 minutes with a badly-acted script to go along with it, but to my surprise it was NONE of that, unless you count the whole gun angle of it. For a smaller film, the production & acting was surprisingly good for the most part. Every scene with Tristan, the main villain was particularly entertaining to watch, almost like a 2008 Joker type of character, though with MUCH less motivation. And Thomas Kane(you may remember as the 2004 Punisher), for what little screentime he had, was really good as well. I had a few minor problems (plot & logistics-wise) to point out, but it doesn't take away that this was a relatively decent, entertaining film with a good message. The only reason I can think of why all the cRitIcS at Rotten Tomatoes gave it a rotten review is solely based on the fact that it was a bunch of snooty Republicans who distributed it,(Well, okay). But it clearly prevented them from reviewing the film based on its contents, which seems to be a huge problem with critics today. ***Definitely not a family-friendly movie, as it's full of swearing, unadulterated bloody violence & nudity,*** but for a mature audience, it's worth a watch.",Run Hide Fight

The aspects of making Christianity the victim here is a reflection of Ben Shapiro's own inadequacies where he can't understand the facts about far-right extremism or how Christianity tries to erode common decency in our nation as-is.

Writer and Director Kyle Rankin does not do as well. Mr. Rankin cannot make up his mind whether he is taking a serious look at the emotionally charged scenario of school shootings or making a straight Hollywood action movie.
An attempt to address moral questions occurs when Zoe confronts one of the shooters to learn his motivation. She eventually inspires him to seek redemption by convincing him that his personal humiliation does not justify his violent response.
On the other hand, Tristan Voy (Eli Brown) is more typical of the modern-day bad guy. The attention seeking leader of the attackers is not driven by rage or acting out the homicidal ideation that seems to motivate most school shootings. Tristan is the super villain with the intricate master plan that has taken every possible scenario into account. However -- except for clever banter -- he somehow is unprepared for the ""monkey in the wrench"" role that Zoe takes on.
The movie also tries to work out Zoe's issues with her mother, played by Radha Mitchell. Not only are the heart-to-heart interludes in the action cliched, but it comes off as a clever attempt to work the movie's title into the dialog.
The movie is also framed by an awkward bookend. Such real life scenarios do not wrap up in convenient ways that brings closure.

In an age where victimhood and harmlessness are glorified, it's great to see a more real world Heroine concept delivered outside of the multitude of non-realistic super-hero movies which everyone seems to love, but don't really believe the ideas of courage and heroism can extend to real world situations.I think I would give the quality of this film an 7.5 - 8 but I'm bumping it to a 10 because it's a new unique story that hasn't been told yet, and for some reason the professional ""Critics"" look like they're on some kind of baffling vendetta against it.",Run Hide Fight

The action sequences were great too! None of that fake James Bond type of hero where bullets always miraculously miss them and the good guy never misses. The setup was awesome, the drama and suspense of the middle kept me hooked, and the ending was awesome!

While the premise may draw comparisons to Die Hard, the 2 couldn't be more different in tone. Run Hide Fight treats the subject matter with the seriousness and gravity that it calls for, while still offering a story of hope and empowerment for those who might, God forbid, find themselves in a similar situation.

1932,kroegerke,A thoroughly satisfying thriller,9,28 February 2021,"Run Hide Fight is a thoroughly satisfying thriller about the resilience of the human spirit.A 21st century take on the Die Hard narrative, the film drops an ordinary person into a hostage situation and follows her courageous efforts to thwart a gang of modern-day terrorists. The film is suspenseful, exciting, and well worth a couple of hours of your time.The main character is Zoe (an outstanding performance by virtual unknown, Isabel May), a disillusioned and angry high school senior struggling to find a new normal following the recent death of her mother. Unlike John McClane in Die Hard (be prepared for numerous comparisons here), Zoe is not a tough-as-nails, experienced law enforcement officer. She's a fragile, grieving teen who's lost her comfortable relationship with her father, Todd (Thomas Jane), her drive to excel in school, and her youthful faith in happy endings.It takes some skill to write a contentious protagonist and keep her relatable; writer/director Kyle Rankin does a good job of introducing Zoe as sympathetic, in spite of her deliberate efforts to push people away. Much of the first act is devoted to Zoe's relationships with the two people she's closest to: her father, who struggles to find the right balance between caring parent and stable authority figure, and her best friend, Lewis (newcomer, Olly Sholotan), who demonstrates unwavering patience with Zoe's prickly exterior.As with Die Hard, the story is rapidly kicked into high gear when an ordinary day is violently interrupted by a group of terrorists, in this case, of the school shooter variety. Led by charismatic Tristan, this team of misfits turned monsters crashes (literally) into the cafeteria and turns the school into a battleground where only one side is armed.At this point, the story surges forward with edge-of-your-seat suspense as Zoe's classmates and the adults in the building all make choices they believe will keep them alive. Of course, some of these choices pay off and some do not. The unpredictability of Tristan and team's behavior makes them a terrifying foe; the fact that Tristan knows for a fact that the school administration will adhere to a predefined crisis-management playbook (which Tristan has read) makes their attack equally tragic.This is also the point where Zoe begins her transition from antisocial teen to hero. Many recent movies and television shows have mistakenly offered up ""heroes"" who overcome obstacles because they possess physical strength, fancy fighting (or supernatural) abilities, noble values, and flawless personalities. Rankin wisely recognizes that drama is far more compelling when a flawed character transcends her weaknesses to make the right choices.Zoe is a hero because when faced with a choice between certain escape and attempting to save others, Zoe chooses the latter. Unlike Die Hard's John McClane, who is trapped along with the other hostages, Zoe has the opportunity to save herself and leave her teachers and fellow students to fend for themselves or wait for law enforcement to save them. Instead, she makes the conscious choice to go back in and rescue as many as she can. It's a pivotal moment in her character's journey, and whether we realize it or not, it gives us, as the audience, a reason to root for her above and beyond the simple fact that she's the movie's main character.As with Die Hard, the film's primary entertainment value comes from Zoe's efforts to save the hostages and ultimately thwart the villains' plans. It is difficult not to get a cathartic sense of pleasure when watching a character fight back in a seemingly hopeless situation, especially one we can all too easily imagine impacting ourselves and our loved ones.Equally enjoyable - and in contrast to Die Hard, where there is no question who will emerge the victor - is watching a movie that doesn't promise a happy ending for the main characters from the start. Without this guarantee, we are able to enjoy real suspense as we experience the events along with the characters.Run Hide Fight is not a perfect movie. The first act is a little clumsy, and Zoe's driving thematic element can feel a little forced at times. But it offers interesting, well-rounded characters we care about, a tightly written, unrelenting second act, and a timely topic that raises several excellent questions regarding the response options currently available to public schools in crisis situations.For all of us who might fantasize about having the courage to save lives in an active shooter situation, it's a welcome opportunity to live vicariously through a smart, tough, resourceful young woman in just such a scenario.",Run Hide Fight

1935,julesspencer-49495,Amazing!,10,25 January 2021,"I wasn't sure how I was going to feel about this movie at first, but I was pleasantly surprised. The acting was truly excellent. The movie was very intense and I was on the edge of my seat the entire time. I saw reviews that said it was insensitive to the topic, but I completely disagree. The more intense and gory parts of the film only added to my understanding of the pure panic and terror one must feel to be in that situation. I saw many others say it was hard to root for the heroine because of what she did in the end. However, I think it adds to her character and accurately portrays what someone might do after being put through the trauma of the situation. No one is going to do the exact right thing every time, so why should movies have characters that do? The films focus on the courage of the main character is truly inspiring.

There is, of course, pure evil in the shooters with little understanding as to why they would do this. I want to watch it again to try to see if I missed anything.

I wanted more sound design, more visual symphony.The core of the film, its action, is all incredibly solid; most characters land, zoe feels well executed by the end.The ending however feels like a reshoot, which is super unfortunate.I really enjoyed alot of the chaos surrounding the shooting and how the villain was prepared for it all, added alot to his threat as a bad guy, lost slightly on the fact his motivation was incredibly muddy, I feel firmly that it should have been more pointed and clear from the start.TLDR: solid action film, some great decisions, shows a lot of promise for DailyWire films going forward.",Run Hide Fight
