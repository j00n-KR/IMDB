0,MartinHafer,A good date night movie...,7,24 November 2010,"All too often, guys are expected to sit through and enjoy so-called 'chick flicks'--a dicey proposition, as guys often dread these movies because they are specifically marketed to ladies. But, there are a few of these films that have a lot to offer both men and women. ""While You Were Sleeping"" is a great example, as it has plenty of comedy and romance. And, it seems, ""Date Night"" is another such welcome film--one with plenty of romance and comedy...yippee! Steve Carell and Tina Fey play a married couple whose lives have become very routine and predictable. In the process, their loves life has become very dull. When close friends announce that they, too, have felt that way about their partner AND are getting a divorce, Carell and Fey decide that they need a bit more romance in their lives. So, with high expectations, they go into the city and plan on eating at a very exclusive restaurant. However, it's a Friday night and they don't have reservations and it is New York, so naturally they are out of luck. But, on a lark, when a table is announced and no one responds, they tell the waitress that they are the couple whose name was called....and the chain of events is set into motion that nearly get them killed and take them on a crazy adventure.The film is not especially deep and seems influenced, in part, by Neil Simon's ""The Out of Towners"". But it manages to work well because the writing was nice and Carell and Fay are very likable. While I didn't enjoy the film as much as my wife or grown daughter, we all had a nice time. So, if you are looking for a nice film that you and your partner will like, you could sure do a lot worse!",Date Night
1,SnoopyStyle,Love Carell and Fey but it's way too serious,7,20 December 2013,"Phil (Steve Carell) and Claire Foster (Tina Fey) are afraid that their marriage is growing stale upon hearing that their friends are getting a divorce. When they're at a hip restaurant in the city, they steal the reservation of the Tripplehorns. It turns out that a couple of corrupt cops are looking for the Tripplehorns and now they think the Fosters are them.This is way too serious. The situations are way too dangerous. It's hard to laugh at this at times. The movie's tone is all over the place. Sometimes, the leads get to play with a funny Mila Kunis and James Franco pairing. Then they have a outrageous shootout with the scary corrupt cops (Jimmi Simpson, Common). I love Carell and Fey. They are fun together. But they don't have much of a chance when things turn dangerous. At least they seem to have fun in the outtakes.",Date Night
2,claudio_carvalho,Funny and Entertaining,7,22 August 2010,"The suburban tax lawyer Phil Foster (Steve Carell) and the real estate agent Claire Foster (Tina Fey) have a boring married life in New Jersey. In their routine, they have once a week the ""date night"", when they hire a baby-sitter for their children and they have dinner in the same restaurant. When their best friends decide to divorce because of their routine, Phil decides to surprise Claire and have dinner in the fancy restaurant Claw in Manhattan. However, they do not have reservation and is almost impossible to get a table; when Phil overhears the waitress calling Mr. and Mrs. Tripplehorn, he lies and gets their table. Sooner two men invite them to leave the restaurant with them and they believe the invitation is because they took the reservation of a couple that has not shown up. But they discover that the couple stole a flash memory from the powerful gangster Joe Miletto (Ray Liotta) and now they have a serious problem to resolve.""Date Night"" is a funny and entertaining film with a non-original storyline about a mistaken couple that works. Steve Carell and the beautiful Tina Fey are hilarious in the roles of the suburban couple that has a night of adventure for taking the reservation of another couple in a popular restaurant. I believe most of the couples married for a long time will easily understand the situation of Phil and Claire. My vote is seven.Title (Brazil): ""Uma Noite Fora de Série"" (""An Outstanding Night"")",Date Night
3,nogodnomasters,Attempt at a relationship movie,6,16 April 2018,"The movie starts out showing us Tina and Steve as a typical NJ couple with a boring life. Once a week they have a date night where they go out to the same restaurant and order the same food. For entertainment they ""guess"" what the story is, or mini-biography behind other couples eating at the restaurant. perhaps one of the better scenes with these two. They are also once-a-weekers in the bedroom. When their neighbors get divorced because they were in a similar rut, Steve re-examines their routine and decides to do something different by going to a different restaurant. Then, in a case of mistaken identity, they get hunted down by two rouge cops working for the mob.There are some great scenes such as the bit role by Mila Kunis, and the taxi cab scene. There are also some scenes that didn't play well such as serious scenes between Steve and Tina as they discuss their life. Neither Carell or Fey pull those scenes off very well.The comedy is good, but not constant. The attempt to make it into some kind of romantic comedy was bad.",Date Night
4,kosmasp,Simple,6,4 October 2010,"You have very charismatic leads and Mr. Wahlberg turning in a role that seems to be what the media thinks of him, is a great nice touch too. Overall though it is a bit too safe for it's own good. There does not seem to be a real menace here. It's a fine line between being funny and scary or menacing for the main characters. Unfortunately that is made clear in the very first (action) scene.But before that, we get to see the (boring?) life of our two main characters. With a bit of a set-up (or foreshadowing if you want to call it that) of things to come. There are quite a few genuine laughs and nice scenes (cameos included), but you almost wish it dared to go a few extra miles (and I don't mean a striptease scene, which is really bad and is only merely saved by the actors).I've only seen the cut that was shown in cinema, so I can't be sure, if the extended cut, added some value to all this",Date Night
5,jboothmillard,Date Night,7,30 April 2010,"From director Shawn Levy (Cheaper by the Dozen, Night at the Museum), I thought from the looks of it this was some kind of spoof of Mr. and Mrs. Smith, but it turned out to be much more interesting than that. Basically the Fosters, husband Phil (The 40 Year Old Virgin's Steve Carell) and wife Claire (30 Rock's Tina Fey) have been married for many years, and to get away from working, looking after the kids and the house, they often find time for a ""date night"". Worrying that they are going to separate, Phil wants to make the next date night different, so he tries to get him and Claire into new restaurant Claw. The place is full, but when the opportunity to steal a table from a couple that don't show up comes, they take it. While having dinner, Phil and Claire are interrupted by two men thinking that they are the ""Tripplehorns"" who have the ""flash drive"", stolen from mob boss Joe Miletto (Ray Liotta), and threaten them with guns to get it. When they eventually escape the two men, Collins (Common) and Armstrong (Jimmi Simpson), the couple try to explain what happened to police Detective Arroyo (Taraji P. Henson), they see the two men are with the cops, so they can't trust them. They decide to try and find the flash drive to end the whole thing, starting by finding the address, from the phone number, of the Tripplehorns, with the help of security expert Holbrooke (Mark Wahlberg), who never wears a shirt. After visiting the Tripplehorns, or rather couple Whippit (Family Guy's Mila Kunis) and Taste (Spider-Man's James Franco), to get the flash drive, there is a hilarious car and taxi crash chase with the two fake cops and the couple, with wimpy cab driver (J.B. Smoove). Unfortunately the lose the flash drive crashing in the New York river, but Phil looked at it before this to find pictures of DA Frank Crenshaw (William Fichtner), who hangs around with a lot of prostitutes. In the strip club claiming to be the Tripplehorns, Crenshaw and Miletto corner Phil and Claire where a feud escalates, but thankfully Claire counts to three (like she does with the kids) and it's all over. Also starring Leighton Meester as Katy, Kristen Wiig as Haley Sullivan, Mark Ruffalo as Brad Sullivan and Will.i.am. Carell and Fey are terrific as the normal married couple having the hellish action filled night, Whalberg with his shirt off is amusing, and the action scenes give you something else to focus on other than the small gags, a very likable comedy action. Very good!",Date Night
6,paul_haakonsen,Mediocre...,5,5 June 2010,"I had expected this movie to actually be more than it turned out to be. Now, don't get me wrong. I am not saying this movie sucks, I am just saying it was not all it could have been.Sure the story was nice and pretty straight forward. Actually so straight forward that it was quite predictable. But still, it is as most of these types of movies are. For a comedy, I found scarily few moments that had me laughing.As for the cast, well top actors and actresses all around. And they did a good job with their roles, but main roles and supporting roles.The movie was never boring, but I just was expecting something more from it.In overall not a bad movie. It would make for a good choice for a movie if you were actually on a date! haha...",Date Night
7,blanche-2,good comedy,7,11 October 2012,"I'm not a fan of most comedies done today. I think they pander to the lowest common denominator and are very crass. I loved the comedies of the '80s. ""Date Night"" is from 2010, and it's quite funny if not rip-roaring hilarious, and stars Tina Fey and Steve Carrell. If that isn't enough, the rest of the cast is a doozie: Mark Wahlberg, Ray Liotta, Mila Kunis, James Franco, and Mark Ruffalo.Carrell and Fey are Phil and Claire Foster, two hard-working New Jerseyites busy with work and their children. They try to keep their sanity with the occasional date night. On this particular evening, Claire gets all dressed up, so Phil decides they are going into New York for dinner at one of the fanciest, trendiest restaurants in Manhattan.No reservation and no table. But as they stand at the bar, they hear the hostess repeatedly calling a party of two, Tripplehorn. Evidently they're not there, so Phil claims that he and Claire are the Tripplehorns and get their table. Before they know it, they're being led out of the restaurant by two thugs who want a flash drive belonging to a mobster, Joe Miletto (Liotta).Soon, this hardworking couple from Jersey who took someone else's reservation are laying down in a boat and rowing in Central Park to escape, breaking into offices, visiting an old real estate client of Claire's (Wahlberg) who is a security man, stealing a car, breaking into an apartment, and doing a sexy routine with Claire attempting a pole dance. And let's not forget a car chase that lasts a good ten minutes.Funny, but the characters are very grounded in reality and have dialogue that married couples will be able to relate to. That's what makes the movie successful - as absurd as the situation is, it happens to normal people who did something many of us have been tempted to do, if we haven't actually done it.Fey reminds me a lot of Julia Louis-Dreyfus in her line delivery. She and Carrell make a great couple.Recommended. Entertaining and enjoyable.",Date Night
8,Quinoa1984,"better, or maybe just funnier, than expected thanks to the two leads and some supporting work",7,11 April 2010,"The director Shawn Levy sadly doesn't inspire a lot of enthusiasm going into one of his movies. At best he's competent at what he does, and some years back made a halfway clever and original 'movie'-comedy (Big Fat Liar), but mostly has kept to Fox studio commercialism like Cheaper by the Dozen and the Night at the Museum movies. And yet, he (or just the studio) must have had the insight to put together two of the funniest people working right now- not to mention with shows back-to-back on Thursday nights on NBC- Steve Carrel and Tina Fey, because they help elevate anyone's work by a longshot. This isn't to say that Josh Klausner's script may not have some laughs, but where exactly I can't be sure, since most of his contributions would appear to come from the super-conventional story aspects (as my own mother put it, ""I don't know, looks like The Out of Towners, or that Blind Date movie from the 80's"").So yeah, basic premise, married couple looking for a little change (their friends are splitting up), go out to 'The City' (NYC of course) and to a very nice restaurant. In a move that could come out of a Seinfeld episode, they can't get a reservation so Carrel overhears a waitress calling for someone else for a reservation and he decides they should take it since they're no-shows. The ""Tripplehorns"", as it turns out, have some shady dealings with some bad dues with guns, and so the Fosters, our confused heroes, go on the run in the city. Whenever the movie focuses on the core plot of all of this, it's by the numbers stuff, save for a climax that ratchets up the absurdity of everyone involved (including good actors playing decent-to-mediocre baddies like William Fichtner and Ray Liotta).It's when Fey and Carrel are allowed to play loose with the script that it strikes the iron. Their timing is impeccable, and they have chemistry together, which is crucial. And when they come across some other supporting characters, like Mark Wahlberg's (VERY) shirtless ex-military guy with all of his high-tech equipment, or the ""real"" Tripplehorns played by James Franco and Mila Kunis, there's further hilarity that ensues from the interactions and precise timing. That's all you need sometimes in a comedy that's based in formula, is two character to at least semi care about (and, perhaps more wisely than a Hollywood rom-com can be given credit for, it has painfully normal characters here, nothing too complicated), and who are funny in semi-funny situations. Even a ridiculous car chase where the Fosters hit a cab and the two are connected bumper to bumper through the streets is funny just because of the acting. Given the right mood and timing they could read a census report and get a few chuckles from the pauses and inflections.So, if you're looking for something masterfully done, look elsewhere. If you just want to see two stars who are funny be funny almost despite some of the limitations in the script, Date Night deserves a chance. At the least you get to see the two show off their ""skills"" in a strip-club scene, and, did I mention Mark Whalberg doesn't have on a shirt?",Date Night
9,tavm,Date Night was an okay vehicle for stars Tina Fey and Steve Carell,6,8 October 2010,"Just watched this on a Netflix disc with my mom and dad. Since it stars Steve Carell and Tina Fey-two of the funniest people on TV right now-I sorta expected the same from them here. In summary, quite amusing and there are some good laughs near the end not to mention during the blooper reel during the credits and afterwards. Still, I expected more and was a little disappointed I didn't get more though I also loved the scenes involving Mark Wahlberg among other pretty good supporting turns by Ray Liotta and William Fichtner. Like I said, Date Night isn't too bad as a comedy though it's far from a gut-buster. But if you're a fan of the two stars like I am, it's definitely worth a look.",Date Night
10,edwagreen,Date Night-More Like Fright Night **1/2,6,21 January 2012,"Enjoyable film showcasing the comedic talents of Steve Carell and Tina Fey. They portray the average couple who decide to spend an evening in Manhattan by going to an upscale restaurant.They get more than they bargain for when they can't get seated and assume the names of some other people. Turns out that they people they're impersonating are mixed up with mobsters, crooked cops as well as a crooked District Attorney.The film becomes a wily one with the various comedic situations that our couple are placed in. The scene where he acts as a pimp and Fey as his tramp is hilarious at best.Mark Ruffalo appears in one scene as a neighbor, their best friend, whose marriage is falling apart. Due to the theme of the movie, we never hear anything else about that situation. Mark Wahlbeg co-stars as a shirtless guy who the two seek help from to get a phone number.The picture becomes one of wild chase scenes and we've seen this too often before.",Date Night
11,studioAT,Decent but not great,2,16 June 2017,"Take two funny actors, and desperately find a plot to put them in that allows them to be as funny as possible. That seems to have been the brief for the folks at 20th Century Fox.And it sort of works. Just. However you wonder just how much of the film's limited success is down to just the natural comedic ability of Carell and Fey, who surely are able to make even the weakest line shine.It's nice to see Director Shawn Levy try something different, having been in the chair for the first Pink Panther reboot film and Cheaper by the Dozen.I would like to see another pairing of these actors. One that is a little stronger than this film.",Date Night
12,jotix100,After hours,6,2 October 2010,"A New Jersey accountant, Phil Foster, trying to add some spark to his marriage life, invites his wife, Claire, to dinner in Manhattan at a tony restaurant where they have no reservations. Since their chances are slim, at best, to have dinner that night at the high priced eatery, Phil decides to take someone else's reservation, as they are being paged to be seated. That's where everything goes wrong for the Fosters.Unknown to these somewhat naive couple, the people whose identity they have assumed, are being sought by some mafia types that want to show them a lesson. The naturally baffled Fosters spent the whole time trying to get out of the mess Phil created for them. They will become involved in chases, dangerous situations as they embark in the adventure of their lifetime. These squares from the 'burbs will probably never go to eat out again for a long, long time.Shew Levy, of ""Night at the Museum"" fame, directed Josh Klausner's screenplay. This was clearly a vehicle for a much in demand comedy actors Steve Carell and Tina Fey, both having popular television programs at the moment. ""Date Night"" has some funny moments. We kept thinking of a much original film, Martin Scorsese's ""After Hours"", that dealt more, or less in the same type of situation.The supporting cast is excellent. There is the shirtless muscle man played by Mark Wahlberg, who can even speak Hebrew! Ray Liotta turns up to do another one of his bad guys. Busy James Franco has a small, but pivotal role. Taraji Henson is seen as a no-nonsense NYPD detective. Mark Ruffalo has a small part. Kristen Wiig, is a welcome addition to any movie. Mila Kunis and William Fichtner are also featured.Dean Semler, the cinematographer, did a fine job in capturing the Manhattan of the wee hours with his usual style. The musical score is by Chris Beck.",Date Night
13,preppy-3,Funny enough,7,24 April 2010,"A suburban couple (Steve Carell, Tina Fey) decide to spend a night in NY at a high class restaurant. When they can't get a table they let themselves be known as a couple that has already left. It turns out the couple is in trouble with a vicious crime lord (Ray Liotta) and his goons think that Carell and Fey are the couple they're looking for.In some ways this is an obvious movie. You know that the couple will become closer together at the end and you know that nobody will die or be hurt. However you have Fey and Carell playing the roles. They are two VERY talented comedians and they play the parts to the hilt. Not all the lines or situations are great but Carell and Fey milk them for all they're worth (Carells' dead pan reactions to some situations are GREAT!). The sequence in which they barge into an attitude-heavy high-class restaurant is hilarious. Carell and Fey work very well together which helps. Also there are good turns in supporting roles by a shirtless Mark Wahlberg (VERY nice!), Taraji Henson, William Fichtner, Mark Ruffalo, James Franco, Mila Kunis and an uncredited Ray Liotta.No great shakes but a fun, harmless date flick. I give it a 7. ""This is Claw. You're welcome.""",Date Night
14,zardoz-13,"Cute, Clever, and Contagiously Funny Farce with Carell and Fey",10,13 April 2010,"The new comedy ""Date Night"" qualifies as the funniest movie since ""The Ugly Truth."" No, ""Date Night"" has little in common with ""The Ugly Truth."" Different characters and different predicaments set these two movies apart. ""Date Night"" focuses on a fortysomething couple whose date plans spin disastrously but hilariously out-of-control. Steve Carell of ""The 40-Year Old Virgin"" and Tiny Fey of ""The Invention of Lying"" have chemistry to burn as the beleaguered suburban couple who plunge themselves into what constitutes a Hitchcock suspense thriller. The theme of mistaken identity propels the plot into paroxysms of absurdity. The comedy emerges from a clueless couple who are nothing like the perfidious pair that the killers want to ice. Our hero works as a tax accountant and our heroine sells real estate. They are literally 'fish-out-of-water.' ""Date Night"" grafts this lively comedy of errors onto a bullet-riddled conspiracy thriller. ""Night at the Museum"" director Shawn Levy and ""Shrek the Third"" scenarist Josh Klausner have crafted a funny but formulaic action comedy. First, they acquaint us with Phil and Claire Foster so we can appreciate their predicament. Phil's flaw makes a great running gag. Second, the complication that frames our couple in the gun sights of two corrupt cops springs from our heroic couple's motivation. They are parents looking for a night off to rekindle their romance. They are so determined that their actions jeopardize their future. Third, the pursuit part is incredibly side-splitting, especially the scene when our hero locks bumpers with a Yellow cab and two tandem up for a farcical chase through the Big Apple. Above all, the comedy works because an accident that could happen to anybody sets into motion a series of outlandish antics. Rambunctious children and fatiguing work schedules have Phil and Claire Foster at their wits' end. Mornings often start with their two children hurling themselves like juggernauts atop them in their Teaneck, New Jersey, home and shattering their sleep. Each parent has their chores for getting the kids ready in the morning. Claire performs the bulk of the duties because she doesn't trust Phil. Phil has a bad habit of leaving dresser drawers open so that Claire careens into them. Despite this daunting family situation, our hero and heroine have set aside date nights for themselves when they can get a babysitter to enjoy a romantic evening out. They have confined themselves, however, to primarily hometown restaurants. Inevitably, during the meal, they grow so bored that they observe other diners and secretly ridicule them for their own amusement. This routine consists of Claire interpreting from their body language so she can create a scenario and then improvise dialogue that the couples might exchange. Sometimes, Phil sneaks in a clever line. Later, they learn separately at the same time that their closest friends, Haley (Kristen Wiig of ""Whip It"") and Brad (Mark Ruffalo of ""Windtalkers"") plan to divorce because they bore each other. Phil and Claire decide to juice up their lives. Phil wants to break out and go to Manhattan and get a table at an ultra-chic Gotham restaurant named Claw. Of course, they are not able to get a table because they would have had to have reserved it a month ahead of schedule. While they sit at the bar, realizing how impossible it will be to get a table, they hear a server summon the Tripplehorns, party of two. When the Tripplehorns appear to be no shows, Phil announces that Claire and he are the Tripplehorns, and they land a table. No sooner have they savored the food than two menacing thugs, Armstrong (Jimmi Simpson of ""Seraphim Falls"") and Collins (Common of ""Street Kings""), intrude on their frivolity. Initially, Phil suspects they are about to be reprimanded for stealing a reserved table. In what amounts to a recurring joke, Armstrong and Collins cannot believe how low Phil and Claire would go to steal a reservation. Nevertheless, they are convinced that our heroic couple is a pair of blackmailers with a portable computer thumb drive that contains some horrendously incriminating evidence. Phil and Claire realize the stealing a reservation is the least of their worries when Armstrong and Collins brandish firearms. Our hero and heroine decide to play along with the gunmen since they cannot convince them that it is case of mistaken identity. Phil explains they have stashed computer drive in the boathouse on the lake in Central Park. Our hero couple gives the goons the slip and row for help. The trouble is that Armstrong and Collins stroll into the precinct house where Detective Arroyo (Taraji P. Henson of ""Smokin' Aces"") is trying to get their story straight in her mind. When Arroyo isn't looking, Phil and Claire exit the police department. They set out to find the Tripplehorns and clear everything up. Claire takes Phil to one of her former clients, Holbrooke (Mark Wahlberg of ""The Departed""), a virile, ex-special ops type turned security consultant. He has sophisticated James Bond style technology at his fingertips. He helps them locate the Tripplehorns. Naturally, the Tripplehorns frown on the Fosters stealing their reservation. Eventually, our heroes find themselves in a sex boutique with District Attorney Frank Crenshaw (William Fichtner of ""Armageddon"") who has launched a campaign to literally sweep the crime out of town with a broom.Director Shawn Levy never lets the momentum slacken in this silly saga. Mark Wahlberg looks like he had a blast playing a spy whose bare chest and muscular shoulders disturb Phil as much as they excite Claire. Meanwhile, a stereotyped Ray Liotta is wasted in a minor part as an egotistical syndicate hood in cahoots with the shady District Attorney. Finally, James Franco and Mila Kunis appear briefly but make quite an impression as a low-life duo named Taste and Whippit. Above all, Carell and Fey make the perfect sympathetic couple. Presumably, ""Date Night"" will serve as the first of many comedies with them as a married couple.",Date Night
15,neil-476,"Funny, with charming central performances",8,21 April 2010,"All Phil Foster wanted to do was treat his wife Claire to a night out as a break from their cluttered professional and domestic lives and, when the exclusive restaurant turned out to be fully booked, it didn't seem to be that big a deal to claim the reservation made by the no-show Tripplehorns. Unfortunately, it turns out that the Tripplehorns are on the wrong side of some very powerful people...This is a beautifully simple premise and, although the credibility with which it kicks off is not sustained, it still hangs together well enough to be thoroughly entertaining throughout its length.I don't think I ever really felt that the Fosters were seriously at risk, but that didn't matter because I enjoyed being in their company. Steve Carell and Tina Fey do an excellent job of portraying a couple who realise that their relationship is becoming a little stale but who love each other deeply nevertheless, and their relationship is very real. There is also some funny playing from Mark Wahlberg, James Franco and Mila Kunis (the latter two deliver an understated lesson in how the Fosters' relationship could be strengthened).In fact the film is consistently funny (though maybe not uproariously so) all the way through - I laughed often at both the acting and dialogue, and was smiling when it finished.A good comedy with a definite sense of fun about it.",Date Night
16,evanston_dad,Perfect Movie for a Date Night,7,2 November 2010,"A pretty funny disposable comedy if you like Steve Carell and Tina Fey.If you don't like those two actors and their brand of comedy, don't bother, because the movie doesn't ask them to do anything but play themselves. However, that was enough for me, and I had a good time with this film.Tina Fey especially has a way of delivering a line that doesn't even seem funny when you first hear it and then has you giggling like crazy a few scenes later.And, though it does so to an admittedly minor degree, the film does strike a note of seriousness amid its zaniness, and anyone who's making a go of a marriage with kids should be able to relate to some degree.Grade: A-",Date Night
17,ferguson-6,Kill Shots and Potato Skins,6,12 April 2010,"Greetings again from the darkness. Most married couples can probably relate to the grind of a life absorbed with work and parenting. Sometimes the fantasy turns into having a quiet moment of solitude. Heck, even ""date night"" can devolve into just another responsibility tacked on at the end of a long week. This is the premise for director Shawn Levy's film. The best part? It doesn't matter at all.The reason this film works is not the plot or script, but rather the talents of the two funniest people in showbiz today: Steve Carell and Tina Fey. The two seem to have an exceptional comedic connection that brings out a timing that reminds of the best comedy teams of all time.Sometimes what makes for the funniest comedy is putting ""normal"" people into exceptional situations and let them react. Here, Carell and Fey are just a typical suburban couple trying to re-ignite the luster of an all too comfortable marriage. The motivation comes when their friends (Mark Ruffalo and Kristen Wiig) announce they are splitting. This starts Carell and Fey off on a series of skits that would make Seinfeld proud.The nightmare begins when the couple ""steals"" a reservation in a hot new restaurant and assume the identity of, what turns out to be a couple of low level thieves. The multitude of skits that follow include supporting work from dirty cops (Common and Jimmi Simpson), the real reservation holders (funny James Franco and Mila Kunis), a mob boss (Ray Liotta), a corrupt city official (William Fichtner) and a ""security expert"" in the eternally shirtless Mark Wahlberg.The approach of the film reminds me of ""After Hours"", ""Adventures in Babysitting"" and ""The Out of Towners"". Some of the best comedy occurs when the main players aren't tossing out incessant one-liners. Think back to Cary Grant's screwball comedies. He was not a bumbling idiot or a stand-up comedian walking through life. His characters were reactionary to the odd-ball situations in which he was placed. That is the approach of Carell and Fey, and I hope they pursue future projects together.",Date Night
18,anaconda-40658,Good Date Night Film.,8,2 June 2015,"Date Night (2010): Dir: Shawn Levy / Cast: Steve Carell, Tina Fey, Mark Wahlberg, Ray Liotta, James Franco: Here is a comedy that exaggerates the memories of young love. Steve Carell and Tina Fey play a married couple who, in an attempt to cure their routine lives, go out on a date. When unable to gain entry to a high class restaurant they pretend to be another couple who are on the reservation list. Unfortunately the couple who failed to appear are targeted by a mob leader. From there it regards mistaken identities where they are both on the run. Director Shawn Levy gives us a great comic sight joke regarding two cars that must be seen to be believed. Prior to this Levy directed such comedies as Cheaper by the Dozen and Just Married. Carell and Fey have excellent comic chemistry as they struggle to figure out the mess they got themselves mixed up in. Mark Wahlberg plays a security consultant whom Fey knew during a house hunting expedition. They turn to him for help only to discover that he wanders about with no shirt on sporting a chiseled physic. Wahlberg also has a girlfriend whom doesn't speak English and interprets the visiting couple as swingers. Ray Liotta is unfortunately wasted as a mob boss. He basically barks orders while eating leaving viewers to assume what a waste of talent. James Franco and Mila Kunis play the strange couple for which Carell and Fey are mistaken for and they are amusing when they appear. While many films applaud adultery, here is a hilarious comedy that freshens the marriage experience into a new order of chaos and adventure. Score: 8 ½ / 10",Date Night
19,HotToastyRag,Really funny and cute,7,12 February 2020,"When Steve Carrell suggested to his onscreen wife Tina Fey that they have some fun after putting the kids to bed, she takes out her retainer and wipes the spit strings from her mouth. I knew I'd love the movie no matter what. Thankfully, the rest of the movie was pretty funny, so I didn't have to claim to love a movie I didn't really like.Steve and Tina are a regular, tired, married couple who never have fun or go out anymore. As many couples know, planning for a date night is nice in theory but rarely happens as the years pass and the kids are born. They finally decide to have a night on the town but get much more than they bargained for. After assuming a false name in order to get a table at the best restaurant in town, they get mistaken for the mystery couple-with potentially dangerous consequences. However, since this is a comedy and not a Hitchcock, you can expect tons of laughs along the way as they bumble their way through the action and deception to try to save their lives. There's also a host of cameos, including Mark Ruffalo, Kristen Wiig, James Franco, Mila Kunis, Common, Taraji P. Henson, William Fichtner, Ray Liotta as a mob boss, and Mark Wahlberg as Tina's shirtless ex-boyfriend. Whether or not you think this movie is going to be too silly, rent it anyway. It's quite funny, and it'll certainly scare you off the idea that date nights are a good idea!",Date Night
20,FlashCallahan,Who likes shirts?.......,7,19 July 2010,"Phil and Claire Foster are a couple who have been married for several years. Their days consists of them taking care of their children and going to work and coming home and going to bed. But they find time to have a date night wherein they go out and spend some time together. When another couple they know announce that they're separating because they're in a rut, Phil feels that he and Claire could be too. So when date night comes Phil decides to do something different. So they go into the city and try to get into a new popular restaurant. But when it's full and still wanting to do this, Phil decides to take the reservation of a couple who doesn't show up. While they're having dinner two men approach them and instructs them to stand up and go with them. They think the men are with the restaurant and want to talk to them about taking someone else's reservation. But it appears the couple whose reservation they took crossed someone and the two men work for this person....It's basically another film about mistaken identity, but with the inclusion of Fey and Carrell, they bring it a notch above average. They are great together and bounce off each other when having silly discussions, but there are plot holes aplenty, and some of the visual jokes let the film down a little.The supporting cast are good, and with the exception of Wahlberg, they are pretty much wasted. Liottaplays a stereotypical gangster, and the cliché of him eating in a restaurant with bodyguards is pretty cheesy. But other than that, it's fast paced, never boring and edited tightly enough to keep the action and laughs constant.It's the type of film that needs believability thrown out of the window to enable the audience to have a good time. There are enough funny lines and kooky characters to prevent the plot and story for what it is, a rehash of several other plots thrown together in order for two comedians to be allowed to improvise.It's a guilty pleasure for sure, it's not intelligent comedy by any means, but comedy, and funny comedy nevertheless.",Date Night
21,zetes,The good cast doesn't win over the weak script and direction,5,19 September 2010,"Like an Adventures in Babysitting for the new millennium, only nowhere near as good. Steve Carell and Tina Fey are a bored, married couple who go on an unintended adventure after they steal a reservation from a couple of no-shows at an expensive NYC restaurant. Those no-shows were actually in a plot to blackmail a US senator, and now Carell and Fey are targeted by a couple of corrupt cops who want to kill them. When the film is just Carell and Fey riffing, the movie's actually pretty funny. Unfortunately, the adventure they get into is the sort that features a lot of car chases and such. Well, really, there's just one car chase, but it's so long that it seems to take up half the movie, and it's so loud and obnoxious that it ruined any good will that the film had built up beforehand. The movie as a whole is so slight and unmemorable that I've pretty much forgotten it one day later.",Date Night

What worked for Date Night: Fey and Carell's comic delivery and timing are strong which made the movie bearable. Date night had a few funny moments. The sports car taxi scene. What did not work for Date Night: Another normal people in un-normal situation comedy. The story-line gags have been done before. The over the top comic scenes are predictable. Ray Loitta is in another type-casted role. Many big names like Wahlberg, and Franco excited the viewer with their presence, but let the viewer down with weak comic material. Date night is a one time watchable movie. If asked: Hey what did you think about Date Night? I would reply ehhh! That sort of movie. Five stars out of ten.",Date Night
23,DICK STEEL,A Nutshell Review: Date Night,8,8 April 2010,"I wonder how many married couples out there can attest to their lifestyle being nothing but revolving around work, family and especially kids, with the latter just sapping whatever free time they have in their waking hours, only to find themselves stuck in a wash-rinse-repeat cycle. The film examines in a comical fashion of course, the lifestyle of the typical family with working parents and young children, and how there isn't anything known as personal time, and having routine becoming the rot in their lives.For the Fosters Phil (Steve Carell) and Claire (Tina Fey), such is their married life, with spontaneity and energy being sucked so dry, even their regular date nights seem like a chore. You know, that precious night where you think you can paint the town red with a babysitter looking after the kids, and the sad thing being that even that can turn out to be lifeless, save for their favourite game played during dinner, where they adlib what they think about other diners around them.Which is pretty cool, given that the two comedians, as the blooper reel played during the end credits showed, hammed it up a lot with awesome ad-libbing and improvisation, that never fail to bring on the laughter. In fact, opportunities where they are cut loose and allowed to go really crazy, are some of the best parts of the film, breathing comedic life into a very simple story of how their, well, little white lie in order to get a table at a swanky restaurant, would turn their date night upside down into a crazy urban adventure, filled with thugs, cops, and well, a beefy Mark Wahlberg.If I had a physique similar to Wahlberg's security expert Holbrooke, heck I'll strut around topless as well all the time, which serves as a running joke about Man's insecurities about the pectorals and abs of another. One of the nicer themes here involves how couples, beside spending time together, have to emotionally connect and be honest and upfront about their desires, and especially fears as well. In between pursuits and comedy, director Shawn Levy pauses the pace appropriately to inject some dramatic elements to sneak in a moment or two to examine just that, before stepping on the pedal to floor the film to its finale.Like I mentioned, it's otherwise a very straightforward film that doesn't try to be more than it can be, keeping things simple and to the point, with great cameo appearances with the likes of Will.I.Am, Mark Ruffalo, James Franco and Mila Kunis being those instantly recognizable. Carell and Fey share an excellent chemistry and play off each other's antics really well from wit to the timing of their physical comedy, and you'll find yourself rooting for this average, normal couple, to be going one up against their adversaries in a single nighttime adventure, since all they want is to get out of their predicament, and back to their home and children like all parents do.Stay until the end of the credits if you didn't have enough of the restaurant scene where Carell and Fey pose as arrogant Euro-trash, for additional laughs.",Date Night
24,namashi_1,Decent Flick...,6,19 August 2010,"Filmmaker Shawn Levy makes decent cinema in his recent-hit 'Date Night'. Some films promise to entertain you, and this film does deliver what it promises. It's not a howlarious fare, but it has it's share of wonderful moments and top-notch performances by each and every actor, to it's advantage.About a bored married couple from New Jersey, The Fosters, who get involved into a hell of a night, due to a mistaken identity crisis. 'Date Night' has a series of hilarious moments, a nice concept, and the execution is perfect. But, there are some flaws in the film. Some places, you feel bored. Especially the first 20-minutes. But after that, it packs in good-enough entertainment.Shawn Levy's direction is good. Josh Klausner's screenplay picks up after a few boring scenes in the beginning. Dean Semler's Cinematography is super.Performance-Wise: Tina Fey is outstanding! She steals the show with a knock-out performance. Her comic timing is truly impeccable! Steve Carell is very good. Mark Wahlberg is lovely in a brief role. James Franco & Mila Kunis are terrific in the lone scene they get. Ray Liotta is fair. Taraji P. Henson, William Fichtner, Kristen Wiig & Common lend able support.On the whole, Not an ideal 'Date Movie', but worth a watch nonetheless.",Date Night
25,Smells_Like_Cheese,Be careful what you wish for,7,16 May 2010,"I have been looking forward to Date Night because it seems like every romantic comedy we have stars the little youngsters that are so lame and don't provide any laughs. Steve Carrell and Tina Fey are absolutely hilarious and two of the best comedic actors in the business today. So my boyfriend and I finally checked the movie out today at the theater and had an absolute blast. It's good that we finally got a funny romantic comedy, most are so cheesy and have lame jokes, but we got a good couple with chemistry and made the movie work so well. The story could have been a total joke, but again because of the actors you could tell how much fun they had making this and that makes it even more enjoyable for the audience. While the story still has a couple of flaws, I really had a good time watching Date Night.Phil and Claire Foster are a married couple with two children whose domestic life has become routine. They have a weekly ""date night"" at a local steakhouse followed by a movie, but it is just as routine as everything else in their marriage. To reignite romance, Phil takes Claire to a trendy Manhattan restaurant, but they can't get a table. Phil decides to take a reservation from a no-show couple. Halfway through their meal, they are approached by two men, who question them about a flash drive they believe Phil and Claire stole from mobster boss Joe Miletto. Phil and Claire try to explain that they are not the couple they're after, but the two men threaten them at gunpoint. They escape and go to the police station, Phil and Claire talk with Detective Arroyo but discover that the two dangerous men are also detectives, presumably on Miletto's payroll. Realizing they can't trust the police, they decide to find the real ""Tripplehorns"", the couple they stole the reservation from and try to figure all this out before their night of evening and romance turns into them having cement booties and swimming with the fishies.Date Night was definitely worth the watch, but I would recommend it more for a rental. Most romantic comedies are that way, no big special effects or break through performances. But Tina and Steve are awesome together. One of my favorite scenes that I'm sure you'll get a kick out too, Phil and Claire steal on of their friend's cars and goes into a huge car chase and accidentally crashes into a taxi. The cars get stuck on each other and as they have this huge car chase they have to drive while being stuck together, the taxi driver's reaction was absolutely hilarious. There are bloopers at the end were also a bonus as you wonder how some of the actors can keep a straight face during these funny scenes. The only flaw being that it was a bit predictable and there was one scene that kept going to the point where it got uncomfortable, Phil and Claire have a scene where they're dancing on a stripper pole and at first it's funny, but it does go on a little too long. But they're forgivable flaws and I would recommend Date Night, it was very funny and an absolute pleasure to watch, I hope Fey and Carrell do more work together, they are awesome.7/10",Date Night
26,lasttimeisaw,Date Night,6,1 December 2010,"As I'm not jaundiced about Hollywood slapstick films, nevertheless the only thing I couldn't bare is the vulgar taste of humor, but Steve Carell could be an exception, I do enjoy THE 40- YEAR-OLD VIRGIN (2005), which maybe Judd Apatow should take the credit. Compared with other A-List comedy actors, Will Farrell, Seth Rogan, Ben Stiller and Vince Vaughn, Steve stands out easily for me. As for Tina Fey, this is her first film I saw (I have not watched 30 ROCKS because I choose to eschew from Alec Baldwin), her poker face performance is smart, but I am not sure if she should stick to her more promising career as a writer instead of a decent actress since the chemistry between two leads are not so sparkling. So many surprising big names here like Meester, Franco & Kunis, Ruffalo & Wiig in their cameo roles and Marky Mark is naked in all his scenes, but I have to say, dude, you still look like a monkey, maybe this time is an ape, seriously shirt on! (no offense to all Marky's fans, oops!)The story is perfunctory with many plot holes (one example, how and why on earth the real Tripplehorns want to book a table in an expensive restaurant as it seems to me that they are not able to afford it), and I have not expected too much from director Shawn Levy (NIGHT AT THE MUSEUM 1&2 ). However I am quite amused by the set piece of head-to-head-connected car chase and the pole dancing scenes in the club, call me desperate to give it a 6/10, nowadays a genuine comedy is so hard to find.At least the positive message spread from the film itself is appealing to almost everyone, the roommate theory does sound believable and no one can deny that as a couple for a long time, which can consume all the passions, it's sad but true, a tonguing kiss with physical devotion becomes so rare to appreciate.",Date Night
27,sddavis63,When The Supporting Cast Is Superior To The Stars You Have To Have Questions,4,27 March 2011,"A 2010 movie featuring the likes of James Franco, Mark Wahlberg and Mark Ruffalo (all of whom were nominated for 2010 Academy Awards.) Unfortunately, none of them were nominated for an Academy Award for ""Date Night."" In fairness, it's not that bad. The stars are Steve Carrell and Tina Fey (both likable enough actors but I think I like Fey more) as Phil and Claire Foster, a middle aged couple with 2 kids who enjoy a weekly date night but start to feel a bit tired and bored with their lives, especially when their best friends tell them that they're splitting up for the same reason. That background perhaps helps explain why the first half of the movie is so dry. I thought this was going to turn out to be little more than a bad and unfunny comedy. Upon reflection, that poor first half is a decent enough commentary on the Fosters life - or at least, how they're beginning to perceive it. Deciding that they need to do something fun and exciting, they head out for a night on the town - and they do find excitement.Posing as a no-show couple at a fancy restaurant where they have no reservation, they get drawn into a cover-up involving a local mobster and the local DA, both of whom are desperate to maintain a cover-up. Ending up pursued by two zealous but corrupt cops they have to stay one step ahead of them and figure out a way out of this mess. That slow start is somewhat made up for by some reasonable funny scenes in the second half. The stuff involving Ruffalo as an ex-military, ex-security type whom Claire knows from her real estate business is quite funny in a low-key kind of way, there's a superb car chase scene and the pole dancing Phil and Claire engage in is worthy of a few smiles. Mind you, even if the dull first half was a deliberate way of making a statement about the Fosters' life, it was still dull, and waiting so long to be pulled out of the stupor it creates is a bit tedious. Carell and Fey are both OK (and, in all honesty, I found Fey pretty easy on the eyes! She's quite cute in the pole dancing scenes!) but you have to wonder about a movie in which the supporting cast (the above mentioned Oscar nominees and even Mila Kunis who should have been an Oscar nominee) are far superior to the leads. It's not bad; it has a few chuckles and smiles; but it's also not great. (4/10)",Date Night
28,thesar-2,Adventures in Dating,6,2 January 2011,"What a cute little movie Date Night was, and one of the most accurate titles I've heard. It's an extremely harmless comedy-adventure for any date night for any couple. And, though it's out of theatre by the time of this publication, it can still be viewed at home for a Date-Night-In.That all said, it's certainly not perfect: of course it has almost zero originality and its main leads have almost zero chemistry – the whole movie looked as if NBC's biggest two stars just met and were just rehearsing. But like most of these types of movies, it's best just to leave your brain at the door and just have fun.If you doit is, in fact, a lot of fun. We have a middle-aged couple, Phil (Carell) and Claire (Fey) Foster on out their ""remember-we're-married-and-not-just-roommates"" date night, but things go horribly wrong when Phil's trying to impress Claire by taking her to a very nice place. As always, it's booked and apparently as always, he didn't think ahead and he steals a MIA couple's table. This leads to a North by Northwest mistaken identity adventure when they try and prove to bad men they're not, in fact, the Tripplehorns they claimed to be.Incredibly, they decide the only way out of this, when the bad men, police and pretty much any other clichéd adversaries are after them, is to give into what the baddies want: a flash drive. So, let the NYC comedic adventure begin so this normal NJ couple, with the aid of a very-shirtless Mark Wahlberg, can solve this and get their kids from the over-timed babysitter.It's somewhat sweet, but then again, you have to believe these people have more in common than starring on the two biggest NBC shows, both on Thursday. And it's somewhat funny – mostly from Fey, who I'm not the biggest fan (Sorry, you hit your peak doing Palin) but then, like Palin, she plays a ditz who her on-screen husband has to spell out everything for her. I'm not knocking that – it was funny and they didn't go too far by beating that dead horse, like 90% of the jokes in The Other Guys – also starring Wahlberg.I can't necessary see myself rushing to the inevitable and original-crushing sequel, but I can recommend this for any couple, or any one, for a quick and fun ride.",Date Night

30,Robert_duder,A cute fun comedy that will likely be considered a Carrell/Fey classic in years to come,8,18 July 2010,"Date Night in some ways falls victim to the comedy trailer fiasco where so much of the great moments and jokes are spoiled in the trailers. However, it does overcome this because those same scenes are still hilarious and the way the story pulls it all together, its a rip roaring, roll in the aisles, fun comedy with sweet overtones and a hint of real romance in tact. I actually wondered when I first saw the trailers whether stars Tina Fey, and Steve Carell would have good chemistry, they seem as different as night and day but much to my surprise and pleasure they were absolutely brilliant together. The comedy in this film is excellent, and while it likely would never turn critics' heads it will most certainly be one of those comedies that anyone can watch again and again and just simply enjoy it. It has adventure, intrigue, action, comedy, romance and everything else to make a movie goer who loves a certain genre enjoy the film for whatever reason. Surprisingly writer Josh Klausner doesn't have a lot of experience behind him with the exception of part of the Shrek series but this should absolutely help prove his writing chops.Two of the best comedy minds in show business today come together for the chance to simply have fun. Steve Carell is one of the most versatile comedians and if he's not already nearly there he will absolutely sit with the comedic greats like Steve Martin, and Robin Williams who deliver comedy with intensity but also versatile enough to do romance and drama as well. Carell has this likable loser quality that he tends to use to the fullest but it works for him. Tina Fey is so talented in writing, acting and producing and certainly knows comedy. It turns out her and Carell are really terrific together. She delivers comedy with absolute perfect timing. Mark Wahlberg puts in some time in a small role but still very funny. He is terrific as a former client of Fey and mysterious secret agent. Other supporting characters who truly add substantial class and comedy to film include James Franco, Mila Kunis, Jimmi Simpson, and William Fichtner. Director Shawn Levy is the perfect match for this cast and this film. His other work includes some (in my opinion) real comedy classics and also fitting of this same genre. I think when he works with great talent (like Steve Martin in The Pink Panther, and Cheaper By The Dozen or Ben Stiller in Night at The Museum) he lets them be what makes them great and simply moves the story in the right direction. There is no complicated twists, or outrageous antics per se but is simply fun through and through. If you're looking for a good time, you want to laugh and smile, and it truly is the perfect date movie for Date Night you won't be disappointed. Check this one out!! 8/10",Date Night

However, the similarities end when they get mistaken for criminals during their weekly 'date night' and are ruthlessly hunted down across New York by the mob.I feel after that brief plot summary I should write '...with hilarious consequences.' However, that would not be accurate. Date Night is not a 'laugh a minute' film. I actually think it's better than that. It goes to great lengths to portray a 'normal' married couple who, although are happy together, there's still that little something - call it a spark? - that's gone out. It's a funny film, but mixed with decent observations and character development that lifts it emotionally from the likes of American Pie and The Hangover.It's funny and entertaining and, although not that original in its storyline, the chemistry between Carell and Fey is undeniable.

32,dromasca,Friday Night Live,5,6 September 2012,"Shawn Levy directed a remake of the Pink Panter as well as a couple of Nights at the Museum, so having a good laugh is something that we should almost take for granted when going to a movie made by him. There are some good comic scenes in Date Night, which succeeds to develop from a romantic family comedy to a crazy gangster movie with a welcome dose of natural and good feeling.The Fosters are Tina Fey and Steve Carell, they are a couple of nice people like everybody else, living in the Manhattan suburb which is also known as the state of New Jersey like everybody else, doing reasonably good economically like everybody else, with noisy kids like everybody else, going through the teens marriage years crisis like everybody else. They plan to go a night our in the city like everybody else but then they steal somebody else's table in a restaurant, they are confused with another couple who made some very bad guys angry, and their date night will become something else than they have ever lived through.Two days after I have seen the film I do not remember much of the action, and I certainly will remember even less in a month. I think that I will remember why I liked the film and I entered the good feeling mood - it was not necessarily because of the laughs which were far from my hysteria level, but because of the likable characters created by Steve Carell and especially by Tina Fey. I knew that nothing really bad can happen to them in such a movie despite the whole Manhattan going wild and crazy around them and police and gangsters trying to kill them every minute at every step. Yet, I cared for them, I shared their like-everybody-else wishes and fears, and they looked to me like familiar neighbors by the time this reasonable Friday night comedy was over.",Date Night

So, these cops take Carroll and Fey and threaten them. They escape and hunt down a friend played by Mark Wahlberg. Wahlberg had the best scenes, as he stands there shirtless while everyone seems to make comments about it. The 2 track down the disk and want to return it.

There is also some action in here which, to be honest, I was quite surprised to see.This film is about an ordinary New Jersey couple who decide to head to the city for their one night out. Little did they know that this night would give them something to remember.Steve Carell and Tina Fey have great chemistry with each other. I am not a big fan of Fey so I was pleasantly surprised by how good she was. I really loved the cameos. The shirtless Mark Wahlberg is the running joke of the movie though.Overall, this is a clever romantic comedy with some great lines.

An accountant and a real estate agent, respectively, they are the frazzled parents of two young children as well. Most days they collapse into bed from exhaustion, without any romance. Of course, the couple does try a weekly night out but often end up going to the same restaurant where they eat salmon and ""invent"" private life stories for the other couples seated near them. Fun, fun. One day, at their book club meeting, P & C hear that married friends of theirs are getting a divorce, due to lack of passion. Gasp, could they fall into the same situation? Therefore, on the next date night, Claire gets dressed to the nines and Phil is so smitten that he suggests they head to Manhattan and a trendy NEW restaurant, instead of their usual eatery. Once there, the wait list is long and they are hungry. So, when a waitress calls out the name ""Tripplehorn"" and no one appears, our dear twosome takes the table, pretending to be the absent other couple. But, what a bad, bad move. The true Tripplehorns are wanted, they soon find out, by the local mob. Ordered outside at the end of the meal, guns are put in Phil and Claire's faces and only by extreme luck and quick thinking do they break away. Scared silly, Claire remembers a bang-up security man, Holbrooke (Mark Wahlberg) who could give them advice, for they are no means many steps ahead of the bad guys.

From Central Park to Chinatown to strip clubs, can Mr. and Mrs. Normal get out of their newly abnormal circumstances and make it back to the suburbs alive?

It would be difficult to see any other couple making the most of this humorous but sometimes predictable script. That said, the supporting cast is also absolutely wonderful, with Wahlberg, Ray Liotta, Franco, Kunis, and all of the others total delights. In addition, the movie's fast pace, varied scenery, nice costumes, and fine production values enhance the final product as well.

Whereas once they included dinner and a movie, nowadays they are comprised of vodka coolers and making a sex tape.Fortunately, the middle-aged married couple in this comedy opted not to expose their genitals in night vision.To reignite their passion, two New Jerseyites–Phil and Claire Foster (Steve Carell, Tina Fey)– head to Manhattan for a romantic dinner.With no reservations, the Fosters surreptitiously assume the identity of no-show couple the Tripplehorns, who–it turns out–are sought by a mobster (Ray Liotta) and his cronies (Common, Jimmi Simpson). Now, if they hope to survive date night, they must recover a valuable flash drive.A screwy romantic/action/comedy with a nomadic plot, Date Night is saved from the archetypal mistaken-identity movie junk pile by it charismatic leads, who navigate this potential landmine with subtle ease.As for the ideal date night: She pays.

39,The-Sarkologist,This is what happens when you steal somebody's reservation,7,17 December 2011,"Phil and Clare Foster have been married and now have two kids, and it appears that their life is pretty much in a rut. Get up, go to work, come home, and go to bed. However, they do take the time to give the kids over to a baby sitter and spend some time together on a 'Date Night'. However, Phil gets a little worried when one of his friends announces to him that he and his wife are going to split up, so he decides to spice the marriage up by going to an exclusive restaurant in Manhatten. However, they can't get tables, so Phil decides to then take the reservations of a couple that do not turn up, and that is where the trouble begins, throwing them into an adventure involving corrupt cops, crooked politicians, and a mafia boss.This movie is about sticking to what you know. Granted, Phil was an idiot taking somebody else's reservation, as is clear with numerous characters in the movie looking at them in horror as if anybody would ever contemplate doing such a thing (as if taking money from a crime boss, and abusing one's position of trust is not a bad thing, but then again sin is sin and it does not matter whether it is small or big, it is still bad).I don't really want to say that this movie necessarily explores anything, but it does make one think about marriage, and the ruts people tend to get into. Going on a 'Date Night' regularly is a good thing, getting a divorce because you get board with each other is not. However, this is the way society is going, so one needs to sit down and ask oneself the question before they get married whether one can contemplate actually living with this person for the rest of their lives, and whether the person that you know now is going to be the same person in twenty years time. Unfortunately it is not always possible to answer these questions, but in the end, I don't believe that divorce is the answer, at least to stale marriages.As for this film? It was enjoyable. Not quite a rush out and purchase kind of movie, but more of a sit down and relax, and maybe have a bit of a laugh kind of movie. I must admit that the character of Holbrook Grant was amusing, particularly since you never see him wearing a shirt, despite the pleading of many characters for him to do so. Also, the movie sort of reminded me of the series 'Chuck', more in the sense that a couple of ordinary people get themselves caught up in a series of extraordinary events, and are forced to use all of their wits to survive.",Date Night
40,Rodrigo_Amaro,Hilarious partnership between Steve Carell and Tina Fey,10,19 March 2011,"Comediant stars of the moment both on TV and films Steve Carell and Tina Fey make a wonderful pair together in the funny and warming ""Date Night"", the story of a bored couple trying to break their routines by going out in a dinner that results in these two being chased by corrupt cops and other crazy characters. The reason of why did this happened: they were confused with another couple when they decided to pick their reserved table at a high class restaurant.""Date Night"" is absolutely hilarious right from the start when they wake up until the closing credits. Carell and Fey have a excellent chemistry, their scenes are the most hilarious in the whole, but they have some help, from shirtless Mark Wahlberg (nice touch), and another crazy couple played by James Franco and Mila Kunis (amazing together), the villains played by Common, Jimmi Simpson, Ray Liotta and William Fichtner, and a less humored but still great presence of Taraji P.Henson. This is a perfect comedy not only with its more visual humor in moments like Tina and Steve's striptease for one of the villains, she playing a hooker, and he her pimp; but what makes the film more interesting is the dialogs and the dialogs, naturally produced and well created, being the most funniest the meeting between the fake Tripplehorn with the real ones, with Steve demanding to the other guy to 'zip' his face. The only thing that bothered me a little was the music played during the striptease scene, it should be more appealing and funny instead of a noise in the background; and since Carell makes a funny remark on Cyndi Lauper being his celebrity crush, it would help if a Lauper's music was played during their insane act, and that would be more funny that anything. Can you picture the scene? He wouldn't be so ashamed I know for sure! It is fun, fun, fun and fun again, and I'm not overreacting. With actors like Fey and Carell you can't go wrong, and if I hear about a sequel for this gem I'll run to see it. Shawn Levy makes a great, funny, entertaining film that makes us relax, smile, laugh on the floor, and forget about everything. A great escape is always a nice thing once in a while and this is a perfect one. 10/10",Date Night
41,zkonedog,Good Story; Hilarious Carell/Fey,7,10 March 2017,"For probably the last 5-10 years, I haven't seen a good Hollywood comedy. They all seem to be about gross-out scenes, teenage losers, or awkward sexual situations. Fortunately, ""Date Night"" breaks that trend by combining two hilarious leads with a genuine plot that can be enjoyed on all levels.For a basic plot summary, this movie follows the exploits of Mr. and Mrs. Foster (Carell and Fey) who (on their one impulse move) steal a dinner reservation from another couple and get drawn into a blackmail plot that has them running all over town looking for a way out.In terms of comedy, ""Date Night"" hits on all cylinders, thriving on the unmistakable style of Carell. As so often happens in the world of funnymen, Carell may be completely irrelevant a year or two from now, but currently he is golden. If you like him on ""The Office"", you'll laugh at this effort as well. Tina Fey also shines in a co-starring role, providing a more direct approach to laughs rather than Carell's subtly.What really sets this movie apart from others, though, is its heart. This is a film that can be enjoyed at a deeper level than just laughs. It touches on common themes like family, stagnating marriage, and trying to find that youthful excitement in life. Besides the funny business, ""Date Night"" will make you both think and feel in equal proportions.Thus, I thoroughly enjoyed this film and highly recommend it to all viewers, especially Carell junkies. It will have you laughing one minute, and contemplating your life the next.",Date Night
42,Floated2,Entertainning and funny,7,15 July 2010,"This movie- Date Night shows perfectly what great comic actors Steve Carrell and Tina Fey are, and how well they portrayed their characters among themselves. With different actors in the main roles the film could have been poor. The plot is all over the place but the leads make their characters so engaging so that I just went with the flow. The plot is pretty simple but its more of a journey and possibly if the plot was more complex, the movie would have been a disaster. Carell and Fey play a suburban couple that are worn out by their busy work and home lives and fearful that their relationship is just going through the motions. They decide to splash out on a meal in a fashionable restaurant in New York City. However when they arrive, they can't get a table but decide to take the reservation of a couple that haven't turned up. This turns out to be a bad decision as two crooked cops are after this couple and so the fun begins. This is basically the plot.There are some great appearances from Mark Wahlberg. Some cameos from Ray Liotta, Mila Kunis and James Franco but it is the excellent chemistry between the two leads that keeps up the film's momentum. One scene where Carrell and Fey show off their pole dancing skills is the funniest I've seen in a long time. I also liked the ending, it was predictable yet entertaining",Date Night
43,Red-125,A good movie was inside this film somewhere,7,6 October 2010,"Date Night (2010), directed by Shawn Levy, had the potential to be a very funny movie. Phil and Claire Foster (Steve Carell and Tina Fey) are a fairly well off, fairly happy, suburban couple. They have a regular ""date night"" to keep their marriage from being boring. The problem is that date night has, itself, become boring. In a spontaneous moment, Phil and Claire decide to go to a new, trendy restaurant in Manhattan, and, in a second spontaneous moment, they claim the table reserved for another (absent) couple. The rest of the plot unfolds from there.Tina Fey is a marvelous actor, and Carell does a satisfactory job too. They have enough chemistry between them to convince you that they could be married. The plot idea is clever enough to support a successful romantic comedy-adventure. This could have been a funny movie, but it never really took off.Despite some good one-liners, the movie's script was ponderous. Running jokes ran on and on. A chase sequence lasted forever, and wasn't funny to begin with. Worst of all, Tina Fey's talent for mimicry and mayhem is kept in check. (Outtakes shown at the end of the film give a sense of what Fey could have done if she'd be given free rein.)All in all, not a bad movie, and worth seeing if nothing better is available. I saw it on a small screen and that worked well enough. Whether Date Night was worth the $12.99 fee that the hotel charged is another matter.",Date Night

However they can't get a table and so they get the reservation from a couple that doesn't show up. But that leads to a misunderstanding that leads to lethal men chasing them down. The movie is trying to be a comedy and an action film at the same time, but that doesn't comes out. The action is there and it is very entertaining, with many car scenes and running. But the comedy is not there at all. The duo Carel-Fey may have been a nice idea, however their chemistry is awful, the comedy material of the actors is like it's being forced out of them, and finally the dialogues weren't that helpful as well. The main idea of the movie is interesting, but the straggle of the couple to solve their marriage problems as well as the love philosophy doesn't mix well with the rest of the movie.

45,TheMovieDiorama,"Date Night might be a suitable comedy for a first date, but its shortcomings taste like cheap champagne.",5,8 June 2018,"Another American comedy that felt instantly forgettable. Despite the talent of its two central lead actors, I couldn't help but feel like it was one overextended 'Saturday Night Live' sketch. Perfectly fine to watch, but something you won't remember later that night. A married couple who go out for their weekly date night attempt to spice up their domestic life by assuming the identity of another couple to get a reservation at a restaurant. Bad idea is bad, crime shenanigans rapidly play out and so our film commences. Immediately, the chemistry between Carell and Fey works brilliantly. They bounce off each other, the expression in their dialogue is acute and the more endearing moments are conveyed eloquently. Their background in improvisational comedy seeps through the mechanical screenplay, allowing an additional layer of humour to be implemented. Granted, I didn't laugh but this is something to be expected now. Much like the Audi R8 that gets wrecked, the pacing is rapid as action set pieces blend well with the comedic tone. Unfortunately though it's just generic, and that's primarily due to the underdeveloped plot and an underused supporting cast. The story itself has no memorability as the couple search for a flash drive to give to a mobster boss. Functional but blandly dull. The inclusion of Wahlberg, Kunis and Franco should've made for some laugh out loud moments, but alas the script never gives them an opportunity to stand out. The conclusion, as always with these films, was far too convenient and had the quickest resolution ever. Director Levy sets up these scenarios and set pieces but fails to utilise them to their maximum comedy potential. Oh, even Ruffalo and Wiig are in this! Completely forgot about that. But then again, I've pretty much forgotten this film. It's not the least funniest date night, as I'm sure some of you will laugh, yet it's not the most exciting date night.

46,Movie_Muse_Reviews,Fey and Carell keep this Hollywood manufactured date comedy afloat,6,10 October 2010,"Everything that can be said about an actual date night (namely predictable) can be said about ""Date Night."" No denying that stars Steve Carell and Tina Fey possess the most universal and multi-generational comic chops of any two comedians working today, but they certainly have to work to chew ""Date Night"" into something palatable.Contrived best describes Josh Klausner's script, but a film this processed comes into being at the top of the chain in Hollywood. In the eyes of a producer, ""Date Night"" attempts to combine the enduring appeal of action films with the relatability of a husband-wife comedy. In other words, plenty of wise-cracks about ""the kids"" in the midst of unfriendly gunfire. Fortunately, Fey and Carell manage to rise above it a majority of the time and not just comically speaking.The two play Phil and Claire Foster, a middle-aged married couple with two kids who try to make an effort to spend more time together and be intimate but fail given their jobs and roles as parents. After their friends (cameos by Kristen Wiig and Mark Ruffalo) mention they're getting divorced, they realize it's time to do something special and head to Manhattan for a night out at an overpriced seafood restaurant. Without a reservation, they have no luck, but they take the reservation of the Tripplehorns to get in anyway, only the Tripplehorns are apparently wanted by some bad folk. The date night turns into a fight for their lives as they become tangled in a web of NYC corruption -- not exactly easy to deal with for a couple from New Jersey.Carell's performance generally sticks with straight-laced husband, which makes his occasional jumps into typical wackiness more effective. Weird to say that it's good he's less himself and more a typical character, but it fits. Fey seems a bit out of a place in a wife-y role (as far as the comedy), but she works her charms impressively. Masters of improvising, the two have a lot of apparent fun, but more impressively they effectively work the odd pauses during the action for sincere/touching husband and wife redefining their relationship moments. These scenes would completely derail most films with lesser stars, but ""Date Night"" never once goes under with them at the helm.So while little praise can be heaped on this attempt to exploit the date night market in an anything but subtle way, few films of this ilk can actually back up the claim that they're entertaining and likable like ""Date Night"" does despite the myriad of shortcomings.~Steven CVisit my site http://moviemusereviews.com",Date Night

51,dee.reid,"Great ""Date Night""",8,10 August 2010,"""Date Night,"" starring Steve Carell and Tina Fey and directed by Shawn Levy, is not a smart film in the slightest, but damn, is it funny and entertaining - two essential qualities that are all that is needed for a film like this. The best thing about ""Date Night"" is the amount of chemistry between Carell and Fey, both of whom are not strangers to comedy and have carried themselves well in their own respective careers as comedic actors. Their respective credits are well-known to those familiar with their work, so I don't need to list them here. What's important in ""Date Night"" is that both leads carry themselves admirably well in this film; they also have a believable amount of chemistry and they're good at convincing us that they really are just a bored suburban couple. Phil Foster (Carell) and his wife Claire (Fey) are a bored New Jersey couple who decide to venture into New York City for their weekly Date Night. While waiting to get seats at an upscale seafood restaurant, they take someone else's reservations, two people who go by the name ""Tripplehorn"" (the couple played by James Franco and Mila Kunis in a hilarious cameo). This sets in motion a series of events that has them on the run from the mob, corrupt cops, and hit-men as they try to clear their names. As it would appear, the two cops (Jimmi Simpson and Common) on their tale are also involved with a shady mobster (Ray Liotta), who is also in some way connected to a powerful district attorney (William Fichtner). ""Date Night"" is a very funny movie; intelligence isn't really needed here. What is needed is the chemistry between the two stars. Someone once said that the mark of truly great comedy is comedy where the actors don't know what they're saying/doing is actually funny. That is the great charm of ""Date Night."" The set-up is incredibly ridiculous, but you believe it and so do the actors. Their on-screen actions, no matter how preposterous, are believable within the context the film and everything they say and do is realistic and carried out flawlessly. Even more important, are the supporting players to all the mayhem. The best of these has to be Mark Wahlberg's Holbrooke Grant, a security expert who never seems to have a shirt on whenever we see him yet is always willing to help out our two leads when they need it most. So yeah, you don't believe everything you see, but you ""believe it."" ""Date Night"" is a great night out on the town.8/10",Date Night

53,MBunge,Don't take this review too seriously,6,6 June 2012,"Date Night wasn't nearly as funny as I'd hoped for with Steve Carell and Tina Fey as its stars, but then I remembered Evan Almighty and that there's a reason Fey did very few sketches while she was on Saturday Night Live. Having readjusted my expectations, I'd call this an entertaining but paper thin comedy that gets more laughs the less you care about it. There's no edge to the story, the plot is sharply outlined like a supermodel's ribs and these filmmakers never decide on what sort of comedy they're making, but the only thing that matters with a movie like this is whether or not you have a good time watching it. I enjoyed Date night. I just wish I didn't also feel like I had to apologize for that.Phil and Claire Foster (Steve Carell and Tina Fey) are a New Jersey Married couple who are stuck on that married-with-kids-treadmill where you wind up tired, worn out and happy to simply get through the day without punching someone in the face. When they see one of the friends' marriage dissolve under similar ennui, Phil and Claire decide to do something about it. They head into New York City to the trendiest restaurant they've heard of and Phil winds up grabbing the reservations of a couple that didn't show. That seems to be working out beautifully in recharging the Foster's love batteries, until two guys show up and threaten to kill them. I t seems the couple who made the reservations are also involved in blackmail and the killers think the couple is Phil and Claire. The rest of the film is more or less the Fosters running all over New York trying to stay alive and figure a way out of their predicament.I did laugh out loud several times during Date Night and if you're only looking for something superficially amusing, you might like it a lot more than I did. While it's shallow and clichéd, the story makes sense and there's a decent amount of effort put into throwing a constant stream of jokes at the audience. Heaven knows I've seen plenty of alleged comedies where I couldn't tell you what was supposed to be funny about them, so I've got to give this motion picture the credit it deserves.If you demand more than a steady diet of punch lines and wry remarks, you'll be disappointed. There are two reasons for that. One, the premise is obviously the old ""fish out of water"" bit where two ordinary suburbanites are thrown into a world of danger and intrigue and the humor should flow out of that contrast. However, almost all of the humor here comes from Carell and Fey just being funny themselves, making clever quips and remarks about their situation. Even the best moments in Date Night come off contrived and forced because of that. Two, while the scripts hammers away again and again at the imperiled state of the Foster marriage, there's not one second when you think these people have any real difficulty or that things might not turn out okay. Phil and Claire are too happy, too normal and their marital issues are presented too perfunctorily to suspend anyone's disbelief that these crazy kids aren't going to wind up in each other's arms. It wouldn't be an issue if the Foster's marriage was downplayed and the focus was completely on being as funny as possible. The marriage gong, though, is loudly sounded over and over to the point where you can't ignore how poorly it was forged.I'm being far too negative on Date Night. This is not at all a bad flick and I would mildly recommend it. If you're in the right mood, you're going to find some of this stuff hysterical. But if you're a fan of either Carell or Fey, you've seen them in much better stuff than this.",Date Night
54,MaxBorg89,A night to forget... in more ways than one,6,19 May 2010,"Date Night is probably the ultimate example of why Sahwn Levy's films are relative hits at the box office despite a distinct lack of personal touch and - with the partial exception of The Pink Panther and Night at the Museum 2 - great laughs: the casting of popular actors who will attract audiences no matter what. And with American TV providing the best comedy nowadays, having Steve Carell (The Office) and Tina Fey (30 Rock) in the leading roles, plus a supporting cast that is largely connected to the small screen (even Mark Wahlberg, thanks to his producing credits on Entourage and In Treatment) is a sure ticket to success. Of course, it wouldn't hurt if the film was memorable too, which isn't really the case here.Carell and Fey star as Phil and Claire Foster, an average married couple from New Jersey with the usual problems that stem from daily routine, with unfulfilling jobs and the burden of raising two children. Hence their occasional need for a ""date night"", during which the try to recover the lost sparkle and experience something new. That last idea takes an unexpected turn when they use someone else's name in order to get a table at a restaurant in Manhattan. As it turns out, the Tripplehorns - the absentees Phil and Calire are posing as - are being pursued by two bent cops (Jimmi Simpson and Common) who work for mobster Joe Miletto (Ray Liotta). Cue misunderstandings, car chases, shootouts and other absurdities before the night is over.It's nothing original, in fact the ""crazy night"" motif has been used by directors as diverse as Scorsese (After Hours) and Todd Phillips (The Hangover, which never actually shows the night itself). And yet Josh Klausner's script has enough potential for at least good fun. That it doesn't entirely work out is primarily due to Levy's direction, which is too conventional for as story as (theoretically) insane as this one, moving from one predictable plot development to the next as if he were checking items off a list. Plus, the abundance of celebrity cameos (which turn into longer appearances for some) becomes boring after a while: the scene with James Franco and Mila Kunis is reasonably amusing, as is Wahlberg's first scene (the subsequent ones, on the other hand, repeat the same joke past the tolerance level), and William Fichtner scores some points based on his usual charisma, whereas Liotta, explicitly sending up his sublime work in Goodfellas, is almost unwatchable as a washed-out gangster.Ultimately, it all rests on the shoulders of the film's leads, and that's where Date Night, unlike other comedy offerings of early 2010 (the woeful Valentine's Day, The Bounty Hunter and The Back-Up Plan) really delivers: although they appear to be a bit uneasy with the purely physical set-pieces (most notably an ill-judged strip club sequence), Carell and Fey shine once they manage to let their trademark awkward humor, paired with some nice voice gags, slip through. If the can manage to find a better project next time, their delightful on-screen chemistry would be worth another look.",Date Night
55,jimbo-53-186511,"Carell and Fey both try their best, but they can only carry this humourless film so far",4,17 October 2017,"In order to try and spice up their marriage, Phil and Claire Foster decide to go on a date night at a trendy restaurant in Manhattan. When they arrive at the restaurant, there are no tables spare so they decide to assume the identities of another couple who had booked, but failed to show up at the restaurant. This leads to a case of mistaken identity and forces the Fosters into a deadly game of cat and mouse with a mobster whom is trying to track down a flash drive that has been stolen from him.Date Night has an OK premise and sets itself up reasonably well; the Fosters live fairly stereotypical monotonous lives of your average bored married couple and also have friends who are in the same boat. It's a believable foundation to build the story on, but somehow Date Night loses its way after about the first 20 minutes...Once the Fosters are mistaken for the other couple then it starts to become a chase picture, but sadly like the Fosters marriage it is dull and lacking any sort of spark. Director Shawn Levy does a reasonable job in moving things along and the film had enough chaotic set-pieces to just about hold my attention, but there are few, if any, genuinely amusing moments. Wahlberg answers the door on about 4 occasions with no shirt on and each time he is asked to ""Put on a shirt"" - this wasn't particularly funny the first time, but to have this joke repeated on multiple occasions showed a real lack of imagination and was just plain lazy. Looking at this picture it's also hard not to be disappointed by the waste of acting talent on offer here; the likes of Wahlberg, Kunis, Fichtner, Liotta and Franco are all in this picture, but their performances all feel phoned in here (particularly Fichtner and Liotta who just don't seem interested at all).What makes the film partly work are the strong performances from Carell and Fey; Carell plays the same nerdy-gawky type that he always plays, but again he does it to good effect here bringing a sort of nervous charm and likability to the role. Fey is also good in her respective role as both the timid housewife at the start, but she shows that she's got a more ballsy side later in the picture.This isn't a funny film and normally with a film as poor as this I would rate it with a lower score. However, I've given this film a 4 out of 10 because, despite how bad the film is, I did think that Carell and Fey were excellent and believable in their respective roles. There aren't enough good points for me to be able to recommend Date Night, but I'm prepared to give credit to Carell and Fey for trying their best to make this film work.",Date Night

I think there are several issues with this movie that caused it to fail. One is just poor writing and lame jokes, I don't remember laughing even once during this movie, which is very strange give that it was a Steve Carell and Tina Fey film. They are both very talented comical actors, I adored Steve in the office and I loved Tina Fey on SNL, who could've played Sarah Palin better? But it takes a lot more than just two talented comedians to make a comedy movie work, you've got to give the actor something to work with, aka good writing. This movie tried to be funny, it really did, but it simply wasn't. The jokes were stale and at times awkward. Also the movie itself was just kind of boring, to me I didn't even feel like it was giving an effort to keep my attention the whole way through. I just felt like I was watching Tina Fey and Steve Carell try to make this bad writing funny, but no one could've done that because it was just so bad. I'll still watch Tina Fey and Steve Carell movies in the future in hopes that they will be better. I've seen ones like baby mama and crazy stupid love that are so good, and it's material like that that lets me know that they really are talented, all actors make mistakes and do bad movies, and I'm afraid for Fey and carrel this was one of them. 1/10",Date Night

Witty lines and zingy one-liners are thrown between these two, and the numerous name actors who make supporting appearances. These include the perpetually shirtless Mark Wahlberg (though that joke did wear thin after a while), and a gruff and dirty James Franco (whose shouting match with Carrell is classic!). The funniest scenes involve two hooked up cars in a frenetic car chase in downtown New York, and a psychedelic dance floor with a pole. Those two LOL scenes alone are worth the price of admission! With the talents and goodwill of the two lead stars, I am pretty sure ""Date Night"" will be liked by most audiences. There are a couple of scenes with heartfelt discussions about married life as well in there. This is indeed a perfect movie for a fun date night.",Date Night
59,JoeKarlosi,Date Night (2010) **,5,20 April 2010,"Steve Carell and Tina Fey are a married couple with kids living in New Jersey who are lacking zest in their relationship. They have a boring ""Date Night"" lined up regularly every Friday, but even that is getting routine, and so hubby decides to spice things up by taking wifey out to dinner at an expensive Manhattan restaurant. When they arrive to find out that the place is booked up for the night they pretend to be another couple who didn't show up, so they can swipe their dinner reservation. But they are in for the mess of their lives when their meal is interrupted by a couple of crooked cops who mistake them for the other couple, who it turns out just happened to be in possession of something they wanted. This just wasn't a very funny or even interesting movie, and there's not much I can say about. It wasn't well written, and Steve Carell is pretty much doing the same old nerdy guy act he's tried in all his other movies. The best I can say for Tina Fey is that she looked deliciously slutty impersonating a whore late in the movie. ** out of ****",Date Night
60,EUyeshima,Carell and Fey Show Smart Rapport in a Domestic Comedy Disguised as a Chase Film,7,18 April 2010,"Pairing Steve Carell and Tina Fey as a married couple in a movie is genuinely inspired casting, primarily because they both have razor-sharp improvisational skills that bring out the best in their respective comedy styles. This 2010 comedy vehicle definitely benefits from their mutually compatible presence, but neither Josh Klausner's overly formulaic script nor Shawn Levy's (""Night at the Museum"") wildly uneven direction can quite measure up to the stars' talents. In fact, Carell and Fey shine the most during the all-too-brief closing credits when a series of bloopers roll where each take tops the previous one with an even more hilarious line reading. Judd Apatow calls these kinds of clips ""line-o-rama's"" on his DVD extras for ""The 40-Year-Old Virgin"" and ""Knocked Up"", and one hopes the producers of this movie will include much more of the co-stars' riffing once the DVD becomes available.The story begins with the drab domestic existence that Phil and Claire Foster play out every day as an ordinary couple living in the New Jersey suburbs. He's a tax accountant, and she's a real estate agent. Married with two children, their well-ordered lives include weekly date nights. These consist of eating the same food at the same local restaurant, the Teaneck Tavern, where one gets the sense that they truly enjoy each other's company. They make a comic routine of imagining what they perceive to be the more interesting lives of the diners at the nearby tables. However, once they find out their best friends are getting a divorce out of sheer boredom with each other, Phil and Claire become concerned they will suffer the same fate. On a whim, Phil decides to take Claire to the trendy Manhattan seafood restaurant she has been dying to try. When they begin to realize they will never get a table without a reservation, Phil impulsively steals the reservation for a no-show couple. This becomes the turning point for all the shenanigans that follow as the couple they pretend to be are in a great deal of hot water.From that point forward, the movie turns into a cross between Martin Scorsese's ""After Hours"", Woody Allen's ""Manhattan Murder Mystery"", and any number of high-priced action films with heavily orchestrated car chases and acrobatic gun-play. The leitmotif appears to be borrowed heavily from Alfred Hitchcock's ""North by Northwest"" in that an innocent couple is pursued relentlessly by unseemly thugs convinced they are carrying an important flash drive containing blackmail information. However predictable the plot turns, Carell and Fey somehow make it work with their pragmatic natures and clever delivery, whether they are trying to escape in a slow-running motorboat in Central Park or pole dancing for a perverse D.A. As a perpetually shirtless security expert who was once Claire's client, Mark Wahlberg has a good time playing a parody of his screen image, while Taraji P. Henson has little to do but look perplexed as an inquisitive police detective. Ray Liotta and William Fichtner have small but pivotal roles, while James Franco, Mila Kunis, Mark Ruffalo and Kristen Wiig show up in cameos. But it's all really about Carell and Fey who manage to do a lot in a genre that on the surface would seem ill-suited for them.",Date Night

It is easy to see they've done it a long time, and they do it well. And they got a nice script to work with as well.But what really steals the movie is the parade of stars in small roles and cameos. Mark Wahlberg, Jamed Franco, Mila Kunis have tremendous little roles that light up the entire movie. And personally I was delighted to see Jimmi Simpson after his role in D.E.B.S.Date Night is a safe movie. It is entertaining without being provocative.

62,Jonny_Numb,"Carell, Fey, Wacky, Hilarious",8,22 April 2010,"""Date Night"" is the type of film that proves that not all mass-marketed, mass-appeal mainstream comedies are pandering to the lowest common denominator to eke a couple million bucks out of an undiscriminating audience. Like ""The Hangover"" last year, ""Date Night"" revels in the opportunity to take a simple, near-universally recognizable situation and spin it in directions that may be familiar, but executed with such distinctive comedic energy and timing that the flood of hilarity--not the plot--becomes the focal point. In this case, Phil and Claire Foster (Steve Carell and Tina Fey, two comic dynamo paired brilliantly) are a generally mundane suburban Jersey couple who decide to spice up their marriage with dinner at an upscale Manhattan restaurant; seizing upon an unclaimed reservation, the Fosters quickly run afoul of corrupt cops and a mob kingpin (a sadly underused Ray Liotta), seeking the contents of an elusive flash-drive possessed by the actual reservation owners, the Tripplehorns (James Franco and Mila Kunis). Rounding out the elite cast are Mark Wahlberg as a persistently shirtless secret-ops type; William Fichtner as a sleazy DA; and Tarjai Henson as a sassy NYC cop. While ""Date Night"" goes through wacky action/comedy antics in a manner that's not entirely unfamiliar, it's the inspired casting of a band of old pros and young up-and-comers that synthesizes the material into comic gold.7.5 out of 10",Date Night

They want to dine in a fancy place, but without a reservation they are forced to wait at the bar until the opportunity arises to ""steal"" the reservation of a no-show couple.This premise is already pretty thin: who would actually go without reservation to a fancy restaurant on a Friday night, hoping somehow to ""squeeze in""? What follows is yet another take on the mistaken identity theme, done many times before and much better (should I mention ""North by Northwest""?)Mistaken for a couple of petty criminals the Fosters have a series of unfunny adventures with cops and criminals. Taraji P. Henson and Ray Liotta are in the supporting cast. Guess who's the criminal and go with the most predictable option.I saw several Carell's movies and most are hit or miss. With a decent plot, Carell can be very funny in his deadpan way. This was not a good plot but a series of gags that could easily be disconnected: meeting with beefy, rich guy to make hubby jealous; pretending to be a pole dancer; the inevitable car chase, etc.The attempt to squeeze in some ""daily wisdom for married couples"" further ruined any chance to actually enjoy the story.

I would go so far as too call it laugh out loud, but it's very adorable (that's for sure)The film is driven mostly, by Fey's and Carrell's ability to hold the screen for a little less than ninety minutes. They do a lot of running around, but the screenplay gives them enough witty banner to allow them to perform to the best of their comedic abilities. Sometimes, they get to be physically funny as well, including a climactic pole dancing sequence in a strip joint, definitely the funniest scene in the movie.In the end, I think I can safely say that Date Night does its job, There is a little room for improvement, but it is still very amusing.",Date Night

It was obviously having some difficulties as the film has been littered by BIG stars in confusingly small roles. Ruffalo, Franco, Liotta, all show up with nothing better to do. Fey and Carrell come across as comedy chums rather than the married couple they are supposed to be. It's really a disappointing film that's as mediocre as it gets.

The editing felt too strange, allowing the spectator noticing cuts and cuts all the time, which may suggest an insecurity from the director. However, as the movie goes, the storyline proves to be very creative, with comic situations and characters all the while. The robot rock dancing is an indeed funny scene. The cast is well known and do their job as much as they can-- with exception of the obvious Steve Carell, who plays an obvious character. Also, the way that Foster couple was confused with two other guys feels original, and I couldn't ever see that coming when they entered in the bar. If it wasn't for such weird directing and editing, I would consider this film to be a great one.

I found myself not paying attention for stretches of the movie. The script is in need of good humor while the non R rating surely doesn't help in this regard. (spoiler) The last 20 min are especially dull and bad with a poorly done car-chase scene and a bunch of guys pointing guns at one another on a roof-top.

But even that many funny and talented people can't work miracles with an utterly average script.There are some laughs here (the androgynous thing was hilarious), but most of the situations that the Fosters find themselves in just aren't pushed hard enough for humor. As a result, Date Night ended up being more amusing than funny.

But, there was one thing I did like. When Phil and Claire are seated at dinner they play a game between them. They look around and imagine a scenario regarding the other customers in the place.

74,dunmore_ego,A night to (kinda) remember.,6,12 June 2011,"DATE NIGHT is an adequate comedy with exactly three high points, about married couple Phil and Claire (Steve Carell and Tina Fey) in a rut; unrewarding jobs, three kids, no sex. On one of their regular Date Nights, they raunch it up a little by going into the city of Manhattan for dinner; at a hip restaurant, they claim another couple's table, feeling it's the craziest thing they've done. But the night has just begun... Through a series of mixups, the couple gets involved with crooked cops, pervert attorneys, car chases, robberies, mobsters... and Marky Mark with his shirt off. I didn't forget you, my squealing piggies - the three high points of the movie: 1) A unique car chase with two cars stuck to each others' front ends. 2) James Franco and Mila Kunis as a trash-talking trash couple. 3) Marky Mark with his shirt off.Directed by Shawn Levy (NIGHT AT THE MUSEUM), written by Josh Klausner, action and dialog is generally good, but is defiantly raised whenever the cameos arrive: Ray Liotta as a mobster (big stretch), Mark Ruffalo as a dissatisfied husband (somewhat tautologous), William Fichtner as the pervert attorney. Steve Carell brings the Everyman with the nasal personality, Tiny Fey brings the gorgeous, Common brings the gangsta, James Franco brings the meaningful tatts, Mila Kunis brings the devoted beeatch, Mark Wahlberg brings The Shatner and does his whole role shirtless and body-oiled. By far the funniest part of the movie. Drink him in. Later, when talking about how Claire ""lit up"" when confronted with Marky Mark With His Shirt Off, Phil complains, ""...And why do you need muscles on your shoulders like that?"" There is a touching moment in the car, where Claire complains she can't ""light up"" for Phil that way because her day is so traumatically busy - and he doesn't argue, but comes to her rescue, ""I'm not saying your day isn't hard work, but there's someone there to help you with the burden - me.""

It is so formulaic and uninspired that it should have been called ""A Series of Convenient Plot Devices and Delightful Misunderstandings"".In fact without Steve Carrell and Tina Fey on the poster this would have instantly sunk without a trace, and deservedly so.If you asked me to describe what I thought Steve Carrell is like in real life using only one word, I'd say ""likable"", maybe even ""inoffensive"". For Tina Fey, also ""likable"", you might even elicit a ""spunky"" out of me on another day. Why these two people are chosen to be the leads in a film about a couple that have lost the ""spark"", and feel that they are simply ""existing"" in a faulty marriage is beyond me. They both get along, are good parents and love and help each other, where's the flaw? Rant-mode on.And that's the problem with you Mainstream! You will accept any tripe that you are given as long as it is delivered with a friendly familiar face.""Oh that looks sh*t. What Cameron Diaz is in it? Well I better watch then.""

Rant-mode off.So Date Night isn't a bad movie, it is just such a product and so carefully cultivated that before it starts you know how it will end, like most action movies, but ­unlike most action movies I could give a f*ck how they get there.Steve and Tine are hubby and wife Phil and Claire. They lead a routine existence, love each other and their two kids, everyone gets along; but the spark is gone. Apparently they miss the spark.So in a totally outlandish development Phil tells Claire that this weekly Date Night they are heading into the CITY for dinner. Once they get to the restaurant they find out that no reservations means no dinner and order drinks. When after a few minutes no booze is forthcoming they grow bold and take a reservation that wasn't theirs.Half way through a magical dinner some dudes show and ask them to step outside, at this stage they think they have been sprung for reservation snatching. But these dudes are after something else, something the people who made the reservation have, but not little old Phil and Claire.The rest of the movie has them running all over the city in cutesy ""Oh I can't believe this is happening to us"" situations saying ""Oh I can't believe she just said that"" stuff, normally featuring penises and vaginas (each organ gets crammed into multiple alleged jokes). Of course the bad guys mistakenly think their desperation actions are the work of pros, they continuously run into each other and there is all the PG level violence that the Mainstream can handle.This ain't Kick-Ass folks, rest easy.Oh and they have a bunch of ""name"" actors spotted throughout the film, Mainstream will recognise them from when they were last in Who magazine. They even get to use the regulation (no more than) 1 F Word. I bet if Tina said it this would be labelled edgy, and they didn't want that so Steve got to say it this time.I bet in Date Night 2 Tina gets a go.By the end Phil and Claire realise that their little existence isn't so hum-drum after all.And it's all over in an inoffensive, at times spunky, and above all likable 90 minutes so you can get some icecream on the way out.Damn you Mainstream!

It was a good idea to pair them together and make it a comedy.The writers definitely knew that these two stories have been way over-used, so they decided to stick with pure comedy and go over the top. They added a number of recognizable actors and purposely type-cast them. When it's done on purpose like this it's funny. Everything they did in this movie was poking fun at the two genres they're using, but did it with heart, and many funny lines.I really liked the fact that they basically said ""We know you've seen these stories before, so we won't bore you with all the contrived details, we'll wrap everything up in a nice bow before you get bored, that way you can see the comedy in the situation.""

At times the writing flags. Normally, you can be in awe of the immense talent of the leads who mouth those lines; they make them believable. Here, some of the lines are so dumb that even the very talented actors have trouble breathing life into them.The scenario work varies from rather empty/cookie-cutter to somewhat engaging. One thing I had trouble believing was that thugs could muscle their way into a super-ritzy restaurant and bodily remove a couple--on the basis of their name. No one showed these guys photos of the targets? Gimme a break!And the flick ends with all the bad guys in cuffs, all the good guys scot free. Ho hum!Which, I suppose, highlights the core weakness of the enveloping story: It's not a big enough story to induce us to graciously excuse these scenario glitches.What's good about the flick? They put together enough money to hire quite a bevy of heavy hitter acting talent. The actual film/shooting/sound production technique is fantastic.

81,ajs-10,Saved by Carell and Fey...,6,17 April 2011,"To be honest, I wasn't going to watch this one as I'm not really a fan of comedies. They are generally stupid and labour the point they are trying to make so much that I can find them quite tedious. Fortunately this one wasn't too bad, yes, there are parts you can see coming from about 50 miles away, but it's saved by the performances of the two main characters. I'll tell you more about that after this brief summary (summary haters, and those that don't wish to know about the plot, please hide the evidence while I write the next paragraph).Phil and Claire Foster are an average New Jersey couple and they are stuck in a bit of a rut. They have two kids, boring jobs and everything seems to be routine. Even date night has become a routine; they go to the same restaurant, eat the same food, talk about the same people, it's all getting a bit predictable. One day they hear that their friends, another couple in a similar situation are about to separate. Desperate to not end up in the same situation, they decide to go into Manhattan to a posh restaurant for a nice meal. They arrive late and the place is fully booked, but they wait at the bar hoping for a cancellation. A waitress is looking for the Tripplehorn's and can't find them and so Phil and Claire claim to be them, just so they can get their dream date night. This proves to be a big mistake, the next thing they know two guys take them to the alley and ask them for a stolen flash drive. When they pull out guns the couple believe it's serious. This is where the fun begins and this is where I'll leave my summary. I don't want the Spoiler Police after my flash drive.Pretty decent performances all round, particularly from Steve Carell as Phil Foster and Tina Fey as Claire Foster. In the moments where they are just being a regular couple they are really good. The comedy stuff well, I'll leave that up to you. Mark Wahlberg does a nice job of acting without a shirt as Holbrooke Grant and Taraji P. Henson was also pretty good (with shirt) as Detective Arroyo. Honourable mentions go to; William Fichtner as DA Frank Crenshaw, Kristen Wiig as Haley Sullivan, Mark Ruffalo as Brad Sullivan, James Franco as Taste, Mila Kunis as Whippit and, last but not least, a great little cameo from Ray Liotta (uncredited) as mob boss Joe Miletto.It's a pretty well made film with some nice stunt work and a pretty good soundtrack. Again, The Ramones get an airing of their song 'Blitzkrieg Bop'. A pretty enjoyable film that, although very predictable in places, I wasn't too offended by. It won't feature very high on my re-watch list, but it was OK Recommended, if only for the rapport between Carell and Fey when they're just being a couple.My Score: 5.6/10",Date Night
82,witster18,Dupe Night,4,27 December 2010,"This movie has an identity crisis. It wants to be a comedy - only it's not funny. It wants to be an action film - only we need a little more of it to make it one. It wants to be a drama - but there's not enough heartfelt moments to sell us on the characters, or the drama.The worst part of the film is the first 20 minutes when you realize that you're not getting the big comedy you expected from these leads. Then there's the only two funny bits of the film that fall just before and at the middle of the film, and they are WAY TOO short lived.Kinda reminds me of 'Adventures in Babysitting', in that it's not all that funny, and basically amounts to two kids' unfunny mishaps in a downtown setting.Really disappointed, and flabbergasted at the rating here. Good decision to wait until it came out on DVD, but still feel a little slighted.44/100You MIGHT like it if you liked: Get Smart, Adventures in Babysitting, and Mystery Date(although I think it's a small step down from all of those).",Date Night
83,Sir_AmirSyarif,A formulaic comedy that's much funnier thanks to the talent of the key players,7,22 May 2020,"Thanks to charming chemistry of its two leads, Steve Carrell and Tina Fey, and a few memorable supporting performances from the likes of Mark Wahlberg, James Franco, and Mila Kunis that help to divert attention away from Shawn Levy's flaccid direction, 'Date Night' ultimately rises well above its formulaic premise and provides solid laughs throughout.",Date Night
84,EijnarAmadeus,Not entirely the best vehicle for Carell and Fey.,5,24 April 2010,"Steve Carell and Tina Fey plays a married couple out in New Jersey who's all up to their necks in family responsibilities and is afraid that their marriage is becoming stale and dull. Deciding to take a date night, cruising in to New York, they slip into one of the city's finest restaurants and faking their names in order to get a table, they grab a reservation taken by someone called Trippelhorn. And that's when you know you're in for some kind of basic formula Hollywood entertainment. You know immediately there's going to be trouble, as two sinister hit-men approaches them, believing they are the Trippelhorns. And as soon as the screwball-factor goes further and further the film goes to familiar ground involving a noise level that distracts the viewer from the plot (that you early stop caring about, which seems to me to be actually intentional) and the nonsensical sensitive parts between the married couple. As usual in an all-brand American comedy, cameo appearances are obviously hysterically funny, especially when they're played by someone who you ""didn't"" expect to show up. What keeps the film from becoming that actual drag towards screwball comedy the couple experiences in the film towards marriage, is Carell and Fey's improvising dialog, which makes it worth the while, and some of the throwaway stuff like when Mark Wahlberg speaks Hebrew, or when William Fichtner as DA enjoys a kinky and clumsy pole-dancing. In the end the film tries being some of both; classic screwball, but also smartly self-conscious (as Fey stupidly reminds us throughout that she doesn't understand the plot), and from time to time sweet, sincere and briefly moving. It doesn't handle it all, and it's not to be expected, but if you can simply enjoy the two star-comedians, there's easily a lot to laugh at and enjoy.",Date Night

It feels too safe.",Date Night
86,JohnRayPeterson,"For the most part, just what you would expect from this cast.",5,19 January 2012,"If you've seen a few Steve Carell movies, you probably have some expectations (good or bad); in this movie he is not unlike most of all his other movies (except for 'Crazy, Stupid, Love'). I would characterize many of Carell's funny stuff as Hit-&-Miss comedy; if he does lots of slapstick and makes lots of funny puns or quips, some will make you laugh but most won't. If you are sufficiently satisfied with the humour that does work, you may tend to watch other of his movies. That's not why I do. The same could be said of Tina Fey. In this movie there is plenty of SNL alumni and Comedy Central as well; that gives the movie some sense of familiarity but it does not make it any better or worse. I'm happy these people get some work outside TV; it's not a reason that's going to make me go see a movie but surprisingly it may attract some viewers.The plot, as plot goes, is okay in that it is in part predictable but in others not as much and it did not remind me of any other similar stories, except for the series of chases by Common and Jimmi Simpson. I liked how the mistaken identity aspect was arrived at; the writers appear to have been so proud of that that they almost milked it to death. I said almost because we are reminded of it on at least three occasions. The supporting part by Mark Wahlberg was a good choice; he does make it easy for Fey and Carell to play off of him. Ray Liotta also added to the film and was a pretty good character for Taraji P. Henson's character to play against. The misadventures of the Carell & Fey characters were for the most part predictable; the scenes where Carell & Fey have to pass as pimp and hooker does not work at all, it simply does not and were to me a big turn off. Now that I've seen the movie, I can easily find alternatives to recommend to friends; readers of IMDb can pick from positive reviews and better rated other movies.",Date Night
87,Christian_Dimartino,Loved this movie.,9,23 May 2010,"Steve Carrell and Tina Fey, two very funny people star in Date night. I loved this movie. There is a lot to love here. The laughs never ended. The main reason worth seeing it: Carrell and Fey are delightful and convincing as a couple.The two star as Phil and Claire Foster, a couple who have boring lives. And they get more than they wished for when they accept a dinner invitation at a very busy restaurant.All is well until a couple of thugs come and eventually the two go on the run.I really summarized as much as I could. Cause you have to see the rest for yourself. Date night is a lot of fun. I could really understand why so many people signed on for it. Mark Whalberg as an old client of Claires who refuses to put on a shirt, Ray Liotta as a mobster, William Fichter, Taraj P. Henson as a cop, and it goes on.As much as I loved the film, I will admit this. The film isn't exactly original.The plot was actually used on a Seinfeld episode one time(the one with the limo going to the Nazi rally) and Ray Liotta as a mob boss isn't exactly original either.Duh. But what it lacks in originality, it makes up for in laughs. The two stars bring appeal, but I have always loved Tina Fey. A secret crush.

88,ThurstonHunger,Expiration Date Night,4,26 September 2010,"Boy I was rooting for this film, as my wife and I were in the mood for a good laugh, but this felt like Tina Fey dumbed down. Rendering her mostly clueless for laughs, and zapping her sass was a mistake. I'm not sure if the director/producer or Fey/Carrel took the teeth out of this, but it just seemed to lack any unique distinguishing characteristics.Barf jokes? Product placement. Car chase (and a waste of J.B. Smoove). I think the car chase wanted to be a mocking one, but it sort of came up empty. Even the game the couple played voicing over other couples was a cliché (but at least it gave this couple a little something less Stepford, albeit crassness).That being said there were enough moments to pull me out of some work on the laptop and my wife out of her crossword puzzle. But it was a check your watch kind of comedy, and the ""gag"" reel is a few extended sequences during the credits.A few pop culture plinks, but I have a hunch Fey wrote very little of this. Maybe all of her energy goes into 30 Rock and being a real parent herself, but I'd like to see her next movie be something that she is more vested in. ""Mean Parents"" maybe? Of all the cameos in this, Franco (along with Mila Kunis) was the best. Most of the others were like putting explosives out there without igniting them. And lampooning parents today is what parents like myself need. This is more of a hallmark card that dreams of being an action movie.",Date Night

On a whim, the husband decides to make use of an abandoned reservation. Sounds hilarious, doesn't it? It is, but not because of the plot. First of all, you have two of the funniest people in the world playing the bored couple. You have great supporting actors like Mark Wahlberg poking fun at their image (remember the Marky Mark days?), and there is a lot of inspired moments when Steve Carell and Tina Fey are let loose and do what they do best, be funny.One scene is priceless, involving ridiculous accents, Carell using Fey's glasses and with his jacket on backwards. Look at the credit outtakes as well.It is also nice to see James Franco outside of Spiderman, actually being pretty darn funny as well. Also, Mila Kunis outside of That 70s mode.Sort of reminded me of After Hours, another very underrated masterpiece, although a little more mainstream. It is slightly weird that they remind of each other, although I doubt that Shawn Levy had that in mind when starting the project.I am huge fan of both stars and I wonder why they haven't worked together before.

The two stars are equally amusing, and would probably make an excellent comedy duo should they decide to continue the partnership. The only thing I didn't particularly enjoy was the ending, as it was way overdone and silly compared to the rest of the film. I think they could have kept it in better context. But, the ending aside, I highly recommend ""Date Night"" for an entertaining outing. Perhaps it will even inspire you to let your hair down and steal someone's restaurant reservation.

It's rare that a movie these days makes me laugh out loud but this one delivered. Steve Carell and Tina Fey are perfectly cast as the Fosters, a bored husband and wife from New Jersey who has the time of their lives getting into as much trouble as humanly possible after being the victims of a case of mistaken identity. With a supporting cast including Mark Wahlberg, Ray Liotta and Mark Ruffalo, this slapstick romance can barely go wrong.

So now Steve and Tina must find the Ficklehorns so that they can get the flash drive before the gang finds them.

95,dvc5159,A very funny movie with plenty of laughs. Carell and Fey are in top form.,6,8 April 2010,"I never was a fan of director Shawn Levy's films. Sure, ""Big Fat Liar"" and the 2006 version of ""The Pink Panther"" did get some memorable moments, but they weren't THAT re-watchable. A good, funny movie is something that you can remember for quite some time, and I had a hard time remembering something memorable from ""Cheaper By The Dozen"" and ""Just Married"". However Levy isn't a bad director, it's just that he needs one good funny movie to really hit it off. No, the two ""Night At The Museum"" movies don't count. This one does. ""Date Night"", thus far, is the best movie Levy's directed.By taking two of the funniest comedians today and putting them in a movie tailor-made for them is somewhat like a blessing. ""Date Night"" is a romantic comedy, with a slight detour into the action thriller genre. But it still has many laughs, big hearty ones, especially from both Carell and Fey. You see, both of them play a bored married couple who decides to liven up their love life by going into a posh (and extremely snobbish/overbooked) restaurant in the Big Apple. So the loving husband, desperate to work things out, claims (or rather, steals) an unoccupied reservation so that their night together would be romantic and luxurious. Big mistake, as they are mistaken for someone else, which leads to a night of danger, intrigue and excitement.The best thing about the movie are both Carell and Fey and how well both play each other off. Both have excellent chemistry and have memorable moments and lines. Steve Carell is perfect as the dead-pan husband Phil, while Tina Fey as Claire looks gorgeous and deliver her own brand of jazzy humor. A fine example of their chemistry together is a scene where both of them ad-libs many couples in the film. Great stuff. To quote an early Australian reviewer; ""The two surprisingly ""deliver the emotional reality of a couple even under comedic demands"". I loved them in the movie and I hope they do more comedies together.There are jokes throughout the movie, both physical and in dialog. A fine example of the physical humor in the film: a car chase that is intense as it is ridiculously funny; and what is arguably the most hilarious strip/pole- dance I've seen in any movie. That scene had me laughing so much, I now have to take cough syrup. There's some memorable lines here too: ""You stole our reservation? What kind of people are you?""; ""He turned the gun sideways. It's a killshot!"" among others. To see these two comedians going through all this in a plot so hilariously Hitchcockian (the plot kinda reminds me of ""North By Northwest"") is a hoot.Balancing the comedians out are some fine supporting actors; in fact you could call the cast an ensemble cast of sorts. Besides Carell and Fey, you've got Mark Wahlberg who looks hunky shirtless, to Phil's dismay; Oscar-nominee Taraji P. Henson as a detective trying to put the pieces together; Mila Kunis and James Franco in nearly scene-stealing scenes as a wild couple who enjoy their love life despite their rowdiness; Common and Jimmi Simpson as the two pursuers; William Fichtner in a hilarious yet sleazy performance; and a villainous role for (surprise) Ray Liotta.In technical aspects, Shawn Levy's direction is brisk and fast-paced, and the cinematography and camera work, as always by Dean Semler, is nothing short of great. The editing is fluid and doesn't ruin the smooth flow of the movie. The script, though with some flaws, is still pretty well written. Yes I agree the movie is illogical and clichéd at some points but then again it's a light-hearted comedy at it's core and for that purpose it got the job done tremendously. Plus at only 90 minutes it's pretty much short and straightforward with it's pace, so that you get what you want. Comedic entertainment at it's finest.So overall, this is a great romantic comedy to take both your friends and/or your other too. It's a very funny and enjoyable movie to watch. It's a jolly good time at the movies, and I'm glad I saw it. Hey, maybe I'll see it again if I had the chance. This one's a winner.Overall rating: 7.5/10 (Very good, worth your time and money)",Date Night

One night, Phil decides to go to a fancy new seafood restaurant with Claire to try to get the spark back. Upon not getting a table, Phil decides to take someone else's reservation.

Phil & Claire then proceed to find the real thieves & run away from the dangerous men. The film's plot is illogical, but Fey & Carrell have so much good chemistry that the laughs keep flowing out at a constant rate. There are a lot of funny supporters as well, such as Mila Kunis, James Franco, William Fichtner, Taraji P. Henson, an absolutely hysterical Mark Wahlberg & the others mentioned early in this review. Date Night isn't one of the best films of the year or even the funniest film of the year, but it's guaranteed to make you laugh out loud every couple of minutes.

I'm compelled to make that disclaimer because in the comedic facets of their performances, both stars don't stretch beyond their already proved capabilities. Carell, in particular, does the same schtick I've seen him do in other movies. However, both actors have a surprising amount of chemistry in their more serious and tender scenes (as a married couple), and that leads to quite well-rounded and I think Golden Globe nomination-worthy performances from both. I think the both of them would excel in dramatic roles if they ever rise to the challenge. The supporting cast, despite their relatively big names, are largely disposable, with the exception of Mark Wahlberg, but honestly, when you're staring at his perfectly-sculpted upper body all the time, who can remember if he gave a good performance.",Date Night

In some films it's comedy gold, in others it blows over like a soft breeze. Date Night is saved a huge embarrassment thanks to Steve Carell and Tina Fey. They make us easily believe that their marriage is in a rut. A night out in the city centre goes awry when they decide to nick a couple's dinner reservation, and they're believed to be someone they are not. Their personalities bounce off each other, whether it's them bickering or attempting to get out of a mess, they're a pleasure to watch. Accompanying them is a boring, washed out story with a bunch of actors who're unaware of starring in a comedy. Date Night is rife with cameos.

I don't recall if I've seen a movie before about a couple going on this sort of adventure. Tina Fey and Steve Carell make a cute couple. There's one scene that I thought was quite original: a car and a taxi stuck together, facing opposite directions. A lot of the movie works, and some of it doesn't. For example: when the two go back in the restaurant in disguise to find a phone number. Their disguised looks are clever, but not the way they talk. This should have been funnier. Another scene that doesn't quite work is after a younger couple catch them stealing their flash drive, in their fourth floor apartment. After this younger couple ask them questions, they then bicker amongst themselves and then just leave. This made no sense. Instead of calling the cops, they just leave them there. Also, I'm not particularly interested in strip clubs, so I wasn't exactly filled with joy when this was the place where they needed to find the D.A.

But the thing is, you really have to maintain appreciation for the action, comedy, romance and crime genres to even class Date Night as ""likeable"". It may start off sounding like the average romance item, but it's literally to the brim with action and constant laughs.Especially to those who adore the conflict between puzzles relating to the leads' identities, it's a pleasurable surprise to witness the movie's most charming highlights, Steve Carell and Tina Fey. Their characters are witty, quirky and live up to the pinpointing as Date Night's greatest attributes. They're what make the film fast-moving and usually worthwhile.However, if it weren't for their fantastic roles throughout the satisfying story, the prolonged craziness would probably take over the ratings... only for the worse. Although it's frequently hilarious and genuinely fast, the car chases and just the entire pace is mildly bland. It's just not that exciting to remain focused on the design, which has already been dragged out to nearly 90 minutes.

104,Jerique,Perhaps the Funniest Comedy Of the Year!,9,13 April 2010,"Tina Fey is a goddess of comedy. Her timing and delivery are of the best of any comedic actor. She's definitely high value in the field of comedies and I really enjoyed watching her antics. Steve Carell really pulls off an amazing role and separates himself from being Andy of 40 Year Old Virgin fame.I was really impressed with the film's ability to keep the crowd and myself laughing throughout. I was really impressed how they kept the comedy fresh and didn't resort to slapstick comedy or fart jokes. It's new comedy and it's definitely hilarious. I'd say this is the best film of the year, thus far. It's early, I know, so that may be stolen later on in May (with Iron Man 2), June (with Knight and Day) or perhaps in July (by Salt).Steve, oddly enough, doesn't shine or stand out the most. It's clearly Tina Fey's show, and I didn't expect to find the focus being on her. It's not just her being funny throughout. She's also wearing some skimpy dress for a large portion of the movie and then in a very sexy dancer outfit that makes me shiver with pleasure.This is not one of those movies that has all it's jokes or all it's best jokes in the trailer. It's got a lot of good jokes but ultimately, there's a ton of jokes that are in the movie that I'd label the ""best"" jokes and a bunch of them catch you off guard. Even the jokes seen in the trailer are still funny in the movie viewing.Date Night is definitely on my list to ""pick up on Blu-Ray"" when it's released on video. I'm gonna watch it over and over again, and I plan to see it again and again before it leaves theaters. It's a great movie and hardly any profanities and barely any sexual content. I'd recommend this to anyone, even the younger crowd (with their parents present, of course). It's a great ""date"" movie and I'd recommend couples go see this for a good date, good laugh-fest, and good romantic showing of how a marriage works.",Date Night

Date Night is one of the movies I found, and since my dad had already seen it, and he said it was funny.Date Night is definitely a funny movie. The way the two main characters just keep getting mixed in misadventures and situations which get crazier all the time is hilarious. Usually when a movie is about a married couple, there are those few annoying tropes. Screenwriters seem to hate marriage - they make it seem boring and hellish if there are kids involved, and there's no spark anymore and blah blah. But in Date Night these two actually communicate, even if there seemed to be the same exact problem in the beginning as in many other movies. It's refreshing to see a somewhat typical comedy, yet the writers are not using those tropes as a way to create humor. It's not funny if a couple hates each other, it's just sad and weird. Date Night is an ordinary in its genre, though it is mixing two typical genres together. Still, it's hilarious and worth watching.",Date Night

They decide to splash out on a meal in a fashionable restaurant in New York City. However when they arrive they can't get a table but decide to take the reservation of a couple that haven't turned up. This turns out to be a bad decision as two crooked cops are after this couple and so the fun begins.There are cameo appearances from Mark Wahlberg, Ray Liotta, Mila Kunis and James Franco but it is the excellent chemistry between the two leads that keeps up the film's momentum.

Henson, James Franco, William Fichtner, Mila Kunis, Ray Liotta, Common, Jimmi Simpson, Kristen Wiig, Gal Gadot, Olivia Munn and Mark Ruffalo. It is funny, laugh out loud comedic brilliance, great editing and direction.I firmly give this a 7 out of 10 as it was good, NOT great, funny, but NOT bust a gut laughable.",Date Night
108,ScottDMenzel,"""Date Night"" is a real treat for Tina Fay and Steve Carell fans!",8,12 April 2010,"Before I start talking about the movie itself, I would first like to point out that I am big fans of both of the stars involved with this film. Tina Fay is not only a beautiful woman but probably one of the funniest people in Hollywood. She is an amazing writer and I absolutely adore her show ""30 Rock."" As for Steve Carell, he is one of those actors who I really enjoy watching on the big screen and small screen. I have seen almost everything he has done from ""Little Miss Sunshine"" to ""The 40 Year Old Virgin"" and he has been really good at ""most"" of the roles he has played. With that being said when I saw the trailer for ""Date Night"" I was very excited to see what the end result of the film would be. So when the film finally opened in theaters, I made my journey to my local multiplex and treat myself to a ""Date Night."" ""Date Night"" tells the story of the Fosters who are your typical American family. As part of their normal married routine, once a week Phil (Steve Carell) and Claire (Tina Fay) go out on a date to a local restaurant. One day after spending a night at their friends house, they learn just how mundane and routine marriage can be. After thinking about her own marriage, Claire decides she wants to make next week's date night special. She decides to get all dressed up to surprise Phil. When Phil comes home from work and sees Claire dressed to the nines, he decides that tonight is the night to switch it up for the better. Claire and Phil venture out to the newest Manhattan restaurant on a Friday night without a reservation. Once they get to the restaurant and get denied a table, Phil and Claire pose as ""the Triplehorns"" in order to get seated. While eating they get approached by two goons who think they are ""the Triplehorns."" This is where the fun begins as Phil and Claire's simple date night has turned into a night of mistaken identity and running for their lives from crooked cops and the mob. Lots of laughs and catchy one liners ensue...Steve Carell's performance of Phil Foster was hilarious. He plays a combination of his ""Get Smart"" character and his ""40 Year Old Virgin"" character in the film. I think what makes me enjoy Steve Carell the most is that he seems like a typical down to earth guy. He is never over the top funny or zany guy like say Will Ferrell or Jim Carrey but just comes off like a normal ""nice"" and ""funny"" guy. As for Tina Fay, well she is great here. I think her one-liners were just the best. I don't know if she ad-libbed a lot of them but man she had some great lines. I also feel this role was a bit different from her normal roles, which I liked. While you do see her become ""Liz Lemon"" here at times, you also see a dirtier and different side of Tina Fay here. As for the other roles, there are a lot of famous faces who pop up here and there in the film including a funny appearance by Mark Wahlberg, James Franco, and Mila Kunis just to name a few.Shawn Levy was the man in the director's chair. He is probably best known for directing the ""Night at the Museum"" films. I personally have seen most of Shawn Levy's films and have to admit while he isn't a great director, he is good at what he does. He is really good at creating fun films whether they are geared towards kids or adults. For the most part, I actually enjoy most of the films he directed. I think Mr. Levy knows his limitations and doesn't try to go above and beyond his means, which is a good thing. ""Date Night"" is probably his best film to date to be fair and if nothing else it's definitely his funniest.""Date Night"" was written by Josh Klausner who was the man responsible for writing the dull and lackluster ""Shrek the Third."" Luckily, Mr. Klausner redeemed himself with this film. I thought the dialogue was extremely well written and funny. The situations the two leads were placed in here humorous to say the least. Some of the scenes were just down right hilarious! Without giving too much away, the car scene as well as the strip club scene were two of the best in the film. I think after seeing this film now, I have more hope for ""Shrek Ever After,"" which I was originally dreading to see since the last one was almost unwatchable since it was so dull and boring. But I will have to applaud Mr. Klausner here for writing a fun and enjoyable film.Bottom Line: MovieManMenzel's final rating for ""Date Movie"" is a solid 8 out of 10. I admit I had a big smile on my face when I left the theater. ""Date Night"" was one of those movies where I just had a good time watching it. I think if you enjoy the whole ""action/comedy"" genre you will probably get a good kick out of it. If your fans of either Tina Fay or Steve Carell this is definitely a must see for you. I think overall it's a funny little film. It's nothing fresh or original but its definitely something that is brainless fun for 90 mins. Also, be sure to stay for the credits as there are a ton of outtakes during and after the credits, which are very funny.",Date Night
109,thekyles99,I Have yet to see Carell in something that sucks!,10,9 June 2010,"Steve Carell can do no wrong! I tell you i have yet to see this hilarious guy in anything that sucks. Im not a big Tina Fey fan however she held her own pretty good with Carell. A lot of reviews posted said this was unfunny and all i have to say about that is, if you are not a Steve Carell fan you will not enjoy it. His comedic style is quite refreshing today when it seems comedies are much more miss then hit. I myself have been married to the same woman for almost 13 years and i think couples like us in a long relationship will probably appreciate this more then others. Number 3 in my top 5 fave actors list Mark Wahlberg is actually quite funny in this being well.....himself and that totally works for the character he plays. the Fosters are living in a safe relationship and after Carell hears the wrong info he takes the wife on a "" night on the town"" Pretty much one date that will make in turn them feel a little better about their so called hum drum lives. Great flick and so so glad that Steve Carell was introduced in my life! Oine funny dude!",Date Night
110,axlrhodes,Boringly silly.,2,16 September 2010,"I think silly films,done with intelligence and a wry,knowing wit,can be excellent.Date Night does not however fall in to this category.It is a tiresome,by the numbers,same old same old,routine comedy.Im starting to wonder about Steve Carell.What is it that makes him so appealing to audiences?I for one,think he was at his funniest,in a small cameo in Bruce Almighty.Give him the whole movie,like they did with Evan,and it all comes crashing down.I felt 40 Year Old Virgin was an overly sweary,obvious frat boy inspired film with little to warm the centre and now we have Date Night,the supposedly hilarious action/romantic comedy in which Carell will have us all rolling in the ailes.No.I don't think he's very good.In time i may be proved wrong,but his brand of humour has been done many times over and a lot better by much more talented comedy actors.Cameos are thrown in to flesh this out but ultimately,it is silly with characters saying stupid things at seemingly life threatening moments,like making jokes about penis' when guns are being pointed at them (like it's an everyday occurrence). In comedy films of this ilk,chemistry is paramount to success.I thought this film lacked any spark between the leads and for that reason and the fact that it isn't funny or in any way clever,i'll score it a lowly 2/10",Date Night
111,michael_the_nermal,An Unsatisfactory Blind Date,3,18 April 2010,"Steve Carrell provides his usual trademark screams and naiveté, as does Tina Fey. While I believe many couples will relate to the dull lives of these two dorks, that does not make them funny. Fey and Carrell utterly lack in comic timing or razor-sharp wit. They seem like just some annoying couple of wealthy suburbanites with bratty kids (just like every other damned movie featuring the SNL crew these days) who stumble onto an amazing adventure. This is not to say that this adventure makes them any more funny or less annoying. Watching the sweet, innocent Steve Carrell yelling at Marky Mark to put his shirt on, or flubbing his insults to create dull malaprops, or even squeaking out ""kill shot!"" when a Mafia hit-man turns his pistol sideways, endues groans rather than smiles. Tina Fey, who was fair-to-unfunny on ""Weekend Update,"" does only marginally better as Carrell's straight-laced foil. Carrell and Fey's sentimental comments (complete with slow, maudlin ""Full House""-style string music) about the state of their marriage and other insecurities grinds any comedy in this film to a halt.This movie would have been funnier with televangelist Jonathan Bell in Carrell's role, and Al Greenwood (God rest his soul) in drag as Fey's character. Those were two ""Daily Show"" luminaries who, though not professional actors, would have made this a madcap, silly ride. Can you imagine Greenwood and Bell having a serious comment on the state of their marriage, or the late, great bedspread king of Long Beach ogling Marky Mark for the sake of comedy? Neither can I, but I dare to dream the impossible dream.This movie participated in the ruining of Jackie Wilson's ""Higher and Higher,"" as every comedy these days *must* include it in the happy finale (this song's use was only funny in ""Ghostbusters II""). I don't know if Matt and Trey wrote or advised for this movie, but ""Date Night"" also ruined the ""Peppermint Hippo"" gag originally featured on ""South Park."" If you love your honey, don't take her on ""Date Night.""",Date Night
112,jace_the_film_guy,The Peppermint Hippo,6,16 July 2021,"Led by a phenomenal cast, Date Night was a fun film! It seemed like every scene had a new cameo from a hilarious comedian. While the plot was over-the-top, the crudeness was a little excessive at time and the final scene in the Peppermint Hippo was drawn out, it still had hilarious moments. Carell and Fey definitely need to do more films like this together. It is a great ""in-the-background"" type of movie.",Date Night
113,blacklist-1,Unexpected comedy gold! This is a date definitely worth going on!,9,23 April 2010,"Date Night probably won't set the box office on fire and the audience reviews on this website so far have been pretty mixed. And even from just seeing the trailer. I thought this was a be a good fun movie nothing more. I wanted this to be good, thinking back to The Bounty Hunter, which I saw a couple of weeks ago that lacked much laughter and a likable two romantic leads who couldn't act and acted like two immature teenagers who didn't know how to grow up (That being Jennifer Aniston and Gerard Butler). If your thinking at the moment about what you want to see in terms of a romantic comedy at the cinema and have these two choices in mind. See Date Night. I was amazed at how great this was. It was consistently funny throughout but the comedy wasn't laid on to thick as there were some heartwarming and touching moments between the married couple. Phil and Claire Foster played really well by Steve Carell and Tina Fey. Though at first I didn't think much of Steve Carell, he won me over later. There was great chemistry between the two leads as they capture the magic they first felt in there marriage by going on the run from crooked cops who want a flash-drive as Phil and Claire are mistaken for another couple.I actually rooted for them to sort there marriage out. They were extremely likable, which is what all romantic comedies need. Likebale leads otherwise you won't enjoy the film. There were some outrageous scenes in the film like I wasn't expecting when Phil has to drive away from the police with a taxi attached to the front of the car that is stuck! Also he and his wife have to do a dance at a strip club (Tina Fey dressing up as one) She looked surprisingly sexy for a middle aged woman! This was just great all the way through and it did get better. Also there was great support from the cameos of Ray Liotta, Mila Kunis (who was a main character in The Book Of Eli) and her acting talent was still apparent, Mark Walberg and James Franco. At eighty eight minutes this film was a short length but good though I wish it could have been longer but they probably couldn't have made it so. This is an unexpected hit for me and one date worth definitely going on!",Date Night
114,beachy-38431,Loved Tina Fey,9,12 May 2018,Tina Fey was wonderful. The best thing I can say about Steve Correl was Steve Corell.,Date Night
115,imbluzclooby,This is bad...,2,21 October 2010,"I find Tina Fey and Steve Carrell to be likable people with the former having more talent. Carrel seems to play himself wherever he is and Fey has that keen knack to be sympathetically vulnerable while being endearing and attractive. In ""Date Night"" both of them are barely watchable in this. I was ready to give this vapid comedy a chance, knowing in my heart that married audiences with children can use a dose of lighthearted comedy. The first 15 minutes capture some humorous lines and nuances we can all relate to. Unfortunately this plot can only last so long until we shift the story into a ludicrous crime caper. The rest is downhill from here.This has got to be the raunchiest PG-13 movie I have ever seen and I grew uncomfortable and embarrassed to watch this with my kids. The jokes are dumb, but the plot seems to forge ahead using the same joke antecedents and the viewers who found them unfunny are subject to further torture when they are repeated. I will not mention the bad jokes. I did however find the scene involving James Franco and Mila Kunis to be humorous. Tina Fey's reaction to the grimy apartment is dead on. What misfires is that they hold the ""Tripplehorn's to be more clever than they should be. For example, I don't think Mila Kunis would possess such keen wit being the lowlife she portrays. James Franco especially wouldn't understand that the antique revolver would serve as a joke for using in period duel. That joke doesn't fit. I also get annoyed by Hollywood using the same worn out clichés of criminals being Italian. Who Started this shitty rumor anyway? Ray Liotta, once again, plays the obligatory thug boss. The cab chase scene is very long, boring and stupid. It's like the movie was looking to kill time, because they didn't know what else to do. This movie didn't have promise from the start and got perpetually worse. Hollywood, give us gentiles a break! We've lost faith in the garbage you keep churning out year after year. I may never see another movie again. I will limit myself to watching nature, science and history programs. I don't want you to poison my children's mind by making them believe that Italians are career criminals, or that a greasy drip like Mark Wahlberg could pass as a dish, or that a tax attorney with a lovely wife would get depressed over his so called dull life. Stupid people may be convinced of your stupid movies passing for entertainment. The rest of us are left angry.",Date Night
116,MikeMagi,A night on the town...,8,25 April 2016,"Reading the reviews of ""Date Night"" here, it's obvious that people either loved or hated it. Put me in the plus column. Sure, what happens to the Fosters (Steve Carrel and Tina Fey) when they use assumed names to score a table in a glitzy restaurant turns out to be dangerous. Maybe even lethal. But this is a comedy, not a slice of life -- and the couple's misadventures as they avoid hit men, crooked cops and their own mistakes is thoroughly entertaining. There's just enough wordplay and action -- headed by a zany car chase through the streets of downtown New York -- to keep things perking. If you want logic, look elsewhere. But I'm happy to settle for some good laughs.",Date Night
117,Bravesfan17,Steve Carell and Tina Fey are great together.,9,22 May 2010,"Steve Carell and Tina Fey are the stars on two of my favorite TV shows, The Office and 30 Rock. So when I found out that they are starring in a comedy together being directed by Shawn Levy (Night at the Museum), I had high expectations. Levy delivers a fun movie for both guys and girls. Carell and Fey star as Phil and Claire Foster, a married couple who decide to do something different for their weekly date night. Their whole night goes crazy when Phil lies about who they are to a restaurant waiter. They are caught in the mob and crooked cops. Not to mention that Phil isn't happy when Claire acts like a different person when they meet and old client of hers who is a detective. Mark Wahlberg plays the former client and shows that he can do comedy.Along with Carell, Fey, and Wahlberg are Taraji P. Henson as a cop who is helping out the Fosters. Ray Liotta has a hilarious cameo as a mob boss. William Fichtner (The Longest Yard and Blades of Glory) makes a memorable cameo as New York's corrupt District Attorney.While a lot of humor comes from Carell and Fey within the dialogue, more of the humor Levy has for us is in the situations within each scene. Levy lets us look at the situation and has us find the humor in it.",Date Night
118,girvsjoint,Should have been better!,5,10 April 2010,"'Date Night' is a bit of a disappointment, not so much because of the two stars, who try hard, and make the most of a pretty awful script! There are a couple of quite funny scenes, but sadly not enough to hold your attention for the entire 90 minutes. Slow to get going, the pace does pick up a little in the second half! A couple of UN necessary vomiting scenes could have been left out, never funny in my book. The camera work is excellent, and the film looks good visually, I'm more familiar with Steve Carrel's work than Tina Fey's, and they certainly both have the talent, but as with all performers, it all comes down to the script, and for me, this one just doesn't cut it, it's one of those films you want to work, but sadly, just misses the mark!",Date Night

The central plot is so implausible that we cannot identify with it, nor is sufficiently absurd or satiric so as to be interesting.My wife and I made it through 45 minutes of this before unanimously voting to turn it off.

122,Craig_McPherson,They should have just remade After Hours,3,11 April 2010,"In 1985 Martin Scorsese crafted the superb After Hours, the story of a pencil-pushing dweeb from cubicle land who stumbles into one raucous evening of epic, Rube Goldberg proportions. This is the film to which Date Night aspires, but falls so far short it's a wonder they even bothered trying.Steve Carell and Tina Fey play Phil and Claire Foster, a nondescript professional couple from New Jersey whose lives have casually slipped into the mundane over the years. They're very much in love, but have had to compartmentalize their affection into a busy schedule that involves work, getting the kids to school, homework, and weekly book clubs.Life has been quietly passing them by and they've hardly noticed. But notice they do and in an effort to spice things up, the couple pay a visit to a trendy Manhattan eatery where they pooch the reservation of another couple, who, as fate would have it, have connections in all the wrong places. It's from here that Phil and Claire's night begins to spiral out of control in a case of mistaken identity run amok.Carell and Fey nail their parts as innocent rubes but that's about the best thing that can be said about this tepid affair. The movie plays out as little more than a vehicle for a series of cameos and skits built around such notables as Mark Wahlberg as a perpetually shirtless black ops expert, J. B. Smoove (Larry David's roommate Leon on Curb Your Enthusiasm) as a hapless cabbie the couple literally hook up with, and James Franco (Spiderman, The Pineapple Express) as the low life who got them into their mess in the first place. With so many bit parts relegated to talented players, the story quickly takes on the aura of a script that was cobbled together on the fly, possibly even as the cameras were rolling. The end result is a lack of sincerity and no feeling whatsoever that the story was part of a vision that was created in advance. It's sort of like everyone's winging it, and that's what sets it apart from the Scorsese film it so desperately wants to emulate.If you really want to see this movie done right, pay a visit to your local DVD palace and rent a copy of After Hours. The time spent with that gem will be far more entertaining than this dreary adventure.",Date Night

125,piratecannon,What Kind of People Steal a Dinner Reservation,7,26 December 2012,"Just when things are looking grim in terms of finding a movie that's appropriate for date night, along comes well Date Night. Starring Steve Carell and Tina Fey, this is a harmless little slice of filmmaking that also happens to be very funny. I wouldn't go so far as to call it a riotous laugh fest, but it does have its fair share of moments that allow Carell and Fey to flex their comedic knowhow within a scenario that many people can relate to.Here's the skinny: Phil Foster (Carell) and his wife Claire (Fey) have hit a standstill in their marriage. Their children consume all of their time, and a pair of their closest friends have decided to split because of a set of marital circumstances that are eerily reminiscent of their own. Scared that he and Claire will suffer a similar fate, Phil decides to ditch their usual date night at a local steakhouse for a night out in New York. He's planned to take Claire to an uppity seafood joint she's recently read about—the only problem is that you have to make a reservation a month ahead of time in order to claim a table. Feeding on the spontaneity promised by their excursion from the typical, Phil decides to steal a reservation held by a pair referred to as ""the Triplehorns."" Come to find out, the Triplehorns are in it deep with a NYC mob boss. Two goons who are on the hunt for the couple who's absent from the restaurant find Phil and Claire, and naturally assume that they are, in fact, the Triplehorns. What ensues is a misadventure featuring a stolen Audi, a surprisingly cavalier cab driver, and a Civil War era pistol.What makes Date Night a memorable (though ultimately inconsequential) movie are its often poignant and hilarious observations about marriage. These are sporadic and only probe the surface of typical spousal interaction, but they are funny, as are several scenes that find our protagonists fulfilling their ""fish out of water"" roles in the most extreme situations imaginable. It's also worth noting that Fey and Carell have a tangible comic chemistry, and their more tender moments often register as genuine.That doesn't mean Date Night is a masterpiece of depth and imagination, though. The momentum the movie builds early on tapers somewhat in the final act, and not all of the gags are as funny as they think they are (with one or two dragging on much longer than they should). There's also the ""big revelation"" regarding the previously mentioned gangster and those he associates with, which isn't nearly as big a payoff as it should've been.As the name would imply, this is a movie that's great for a relaxed night out with that significant other. The only problem: it leaves you wanting a little more from its actors and writers. This suggests, perhaps, that a Date Night 2 is in order, as Phil and Claire Foster are a couple that audiences will likely want to see treated to a story that's a tad more well developed.",Date Night

They want to spark it up, and decide that one night they will change up the routine.Date Night has many of the traits I enjoy in a comedy with a good balance of laughs and sentimental value.

127,MovieProductions,"""Date Night"" is that rare comedy that delivers for audiences of any gender",7,25 June 2010,"*** out of (****)Seeing advertisements didn't draw me in necessarily into ""Date Night"", the positive feedback from the critics did. Since I usually side with the critics, I decided to seek out this outing. It turns out, that was a pretty sensible move. This movie is just a lot of fun from beginning to end and it doesn't require your brain to function every second. ""Date Night"" is just great entertainment for gentlemen and women. Men who love to hear things go ""boom"" and drool at the intensity of the gratuitous explosions will eat this movie up. Women who like to laugh a lot and question about their marriage may also not be disappointed. I think Shawn Levy made this movie to appeal to both audiences and he definitely succeeded. It doesn't go without its flaws and it's a pretty disposable movie, but at the moment, it's a great joyous ride, that you may find yourself revisiting now and then.Date Night stars Phil (Carell) and Claire Foster (Fey) who hear about her friend's divorce because of the lack of interaction of their partners. Phil Foster doesn't want to corrupt their marriage so he takes his wife to a highly expensive restaurant named ""Claw"". Since the Fosters didn't make reservations, and the restaurant is booked for the night, they decide to steal the Tripplehorns' reservations. During their romantic evening, they are pulled out by two men who work for the FBI. The two men think the Fosters are the Tripplehorns because they took their reservations under that name. It turns out that the Tripplehorns have the two mens' flash drive that contains secret information. Now the Tripplehorns must save them out of this pickle. First off, I thought the premise was great. Yes, it may be slightly contrived, but it isn't absolutely unrealistic or over-the-top like some action/comedy films. Moreover, I thought the performances were fantastic. Steve Carell and Tina Fey had great chemistry and definitely fulfilled their roles. To add to that, I thought this was one of the funniest movies I've seen. The dialogue was surprisingly witty and sharp, using much mature humor, rather than resorting to cheap, silly humor, which occasionally happened, but like I said ""occasionally"". Furthermore, I thought that the film had great comedic timing and definitely laugh-out-loud hilarious. Additionally, I thought the action was top-notch and definitely sufficed. To add on, I thought the pacing was perfect. No scenes went too slow or too abrupt. Everything fit perfectly and the great execution was very coherent.While the pros outweigh the cons, there are still some flaws. First of all, while the jokes were witty and more adult oriented, some were just silly and resorted to childish humor, most notably in the beginning. Moreover, I did not like that this movie was shot on digital rather than celluloid because it looked way too sharp. Although, that didn't detract from the experience.Sure ""Date Night"" may be disposable and not entirely original, but it's one of the better comedies of the year. It boasts a great script, great comedic timing, two phenomenal leads, and a nice execution. The movie definitely delivered on action and comedy, and surprisingly chemistry. ""Date Night"" comes off as a solid recommendation.",Date Night
128,ciscokid1970,Good movie...written for married couples,8,21 April 2010,"Date Night was a good date movie. Yeah corny over used lineI know but it fits this kind of movie. I watched this with, oddly enough, my wife (tried to borrow someone else's wife badum-ching, just kidding honey). That's the kind of movie this is, bringing out the dry humor that fits ohh so many married couples. Anywayboth my wife and I enjoyed the movie ... see it for yourself. Now if you are single, divorced or recently married this movie will be boring and predictable. (just like my marriagebadum-chingwhoa I am on fire) The movie is well written, almost too well written, moving at a perfectly smooth pace. There are plenty of quick jokes that married people will appreciate. They even found a way to include Hot Cars, Gunshots and a Car Chase in New York. But seriously at the end of this movie you will appreciate your long, stable relationship like a pair of slippers that fit you just right. Casting was perfect: Carell does a great job of playing the average husband with the occasional outburst that has made him famous in 40yr old Virgin and Evan Almighty. I love watching Tina Fey in her 'I just want a normal life' role that made her famous in Mean Girls and Baby Mama. So it is a good movie for a date, of course you will have to watch matinée so that it finishes in time to go pick up the kids from schoolor else you have to wait until it hits the movie rental because you can not find a sitter you trust.",Date Night

Fey and Carrell are awesome in Date Night.,8,7 October 2010,"I've been meaning to watch this for a while now because Tina Fey stars in this movie and I am a fan of her work. I'm happy to say that after watching this movie, I wasn't disappointed. The story was great, it's very enjoyable and quite funny in places. The acting was very good and the chemistry between Fey and Carell was great to watch, they both made a good and believable couple and a funny comedy duo. The characters were okay, they were written well. The writing was very good with some funny moments and the script was written well and the stunts were executed well.It's not your typical romantic comedy where you cringe at the 'funny' scenes instead of laughing, Date Night is so much better than that. When you saw the funny scenes, you actually laughed at them. Tina Fey and Steve Carell did a great job as the Fosters and they shined through and through in the movie. Their chemistry was believable and they made a good movie couple. While the ending is the same predictable ending as all the other romantic comedy movies we ever see, I believe that Date Night achieved what it wanted to achieve, it had a fresh script with some funny one-liners, a quirky plot and great characters. I recommend it to people who can put aside the cheesy, cliché romance scenes and watch it as it actually is a funny movie. Of course it would be, Tina Fey and Steve Carell are in it.Read more reviews at: www.dudedazzmoviereviews.wordpress.com",Date Night
130,Nick Zbu,A definite misfire,3,9 October 2010,"There are several ingredients in this film that should work but don't. The casting is pretty good but nothing about the movie really says 'comedy' as much as 'action comedy.' I'm not splitting hairs, but it seems this movie's main problem was its marketing.When the movie isn't being suspenseful or dramatic (the main idea of a married couple being bored with their lives is one of the few things the movie portrays well), it then falls to comedy. A couple steals a reservation and gets caught up in a pseudo-Hitchcockian plot that defies explanation. Honestly, the plot is the MacGuffin in this movie that presumably allows Tina Fey and Steve Carell to lay down the comedy. But the true tragedy is that the outtakes are funnier than the rest of the movie, showing the film's main flaw.This isn't really a comedy. It has the insight but none of the outright humor. The plot doesn't really exist and it's insane how this movie attempts to tie together. The movie needed a few more rewrites and a decision if it was going to be an action-comedy, an action-drama about married life, or if it was going to be an outright comedy. Something failed to click here and it's easy to see that even at its fairly short running time that the movie was too long as it was. That's a sign that you're running on fumes and need something else to make the movie go.In short? Misfire. The movie has some serious problems that should have been ironed out before it went into production. The movie doesn't know what it is at heart and neither does the audience. To see everybody having a blast at the end of the film (spliced between a baffling make out session in the front yard of a suburban New Jersey home that really makes the audience wonder if anybody directing this film had a clue) is insult upon injury.Honestly? It may be worth a rental, but not if you're expecting to laugh. The moral has to be 'make sure you know what kind of movie you're making.' It's a drama that works at being a comedy and almost works as a fairly decent thriller. It's nothing to anybody, and it needs more work. The only thing it ends up being is a confusing mix set pieces and improv bits. Sad.",Date Night
131,garyvanhorn,The whole is less than the sum of its parts.,5,10 January 2011,"Date Night showed great promise for the first half of the film then ran out of steam (and funny jokes). Phil and Clair Foster (Steve Carell and Tina Fey) are an unremarkable married couple trying to break free of the daily grind that has become their life by having an evening out on the town. Sadly, things do not go as planned and a case of mistaken identity turns an elegant dinner in Manhattan into a night filled with gunfire, car chases, crooked cops and mob bosses.The plot is just ridiculous enough to be funny but not so ridiculous as to be completely unbelievable and the comic talents of Steve Carell are unquestionable and Holbrook's (Mark Wahlberg's) presence for a couple scenes is golden, but there just aren't enough laughs in the movie to keep it going. I detested the car chase scene in particular and what's more I can't even give a coherent description of the scene without writing a novella because it's so convoluted. The movie is also very short. With a running time of only 80 minutes you would think the material wouldn't become quite as thin as it does.Overall Date Night isn't terrible, it's just not memorable or as funny as it could (or should) be. The movie would have really befitted from more screen time for Wahlberg, the interaction between he, Steve Carell, and Tina Fey is easily the best part of the film, but it is all too brief. In a pinch Date Night will be passable for an evening's entertainment but better moves are aplenty.",Date Night
132,RestlessRust,Less than the sum of its parts,5,2 August 2011,"There's a lot to like about Date Night. I have enjoyed Steve Carrell since I first saw him as Produce Pete on The Daily Show. And Tina Fey plays self-deprecation better than anyone. So what could possibly go wrong by putting them together?To answer that, first let's look at Get Smart. I really enjoyed that film because not only did it retain the spirit of the original show, but Steve Carrell made a perfect imperfect hero. He isn't suave or cool or tough, but the villains aren't either, so the plot doesn't really call for that. As a result, the movie works. Now let's look at The Hangover. It's a very different type of comedy -- much more akin to Beverly Hills Cop than anything else. I felt the action took over the plot a little too much at the expense of the comedy, but it mostly worked because both the comedy and the action had a serious, adult attitude to them. That's where Date Night never really comes together. The comedy is funny enough and very family friendly. It's light, it's enjoyable. And the characters are normal people who just want to have some semblance of the lives they used to enjoy before everything started seeming a bit flat. But the action is more hard-edged than that. The criminals don't seem like the lovable oafs of Get Smart who would patiently wait around while Maxwell rattled off a ""Would you believe..."" set. No, these criminals seem like the kind that would leave bodies behind. And our heroes seem like the kind who would end up the featured victims on America's Most Wanted. Yet they succeed in bringing these guys down where trained field agents have failed? It's an uncomfortable mixture that never reaches the realm of believability.Still, perhaps all those things could be forgiven if they were at least consistent in their inconsistency. But the finale takes the action story into ludicrous sitcom territory. The plot resolution would have been a stretch in the 1980s -- I was astounded that this kind of ending could possibly wind up in a modern-day movie. But there it is. So I must reluctantly give Date Night a thumbs-down. As I said, there's a lot to like here, but the stars don't really play off each other as they might have, and they are completely overshadowed by the action plot. Ultimately, there's no reason to watch this film instead of, say, a marathon of The Office and 30 Rock.And that's a shame.",Date Night
133,d_art,"'Date Night' isn't innovative, but the cast is likable",7,10 April 2010,"In this romantic comedy, Steve Carell and Tina Fey play Phil and Claire Foster, a happy, but bored, married couple with kids that needs an extra zing in their life. One day, at an expensive restaurant, the couple, to be more daring, steals a table reserved for another couple, and by case of mistaken identity, they become targets of ruthless killers involved with the mafia.I personally believe this could've worked better as an independent film with unknown actors than a Hollywood-ized romantic comedy. It might've also worked better as a drama. Or, a foreign film. Perhaps it's because I find myself comparing the film to True Lies and that was a high standard for a movie like this. Action was fun there, too. This film's whole mistaken identity plot reminded me of Alfred Hitchcock's North by Northwest, which I can appreciate. I was partly hoping for something remotely Hitchcockian. Well, the film is a comedy, and pretty much stays there, which isn't so bad, but it also makes it predictable.This is one of those films, once I saw the trailer, I knew what I was in for, and when I saw the film, I pretty much got what I expected, except that in the back of my mind, I had hoped for possibly something a little more, but I just got pretty much what I expected. I feel this way perhaps for most of Hollywood's romantic comedies. They tend to be predictable, and I can assume many of these fans do want that predictability, because, if done right, it's a relaxing, popcorn night at the movies. It's like listening to a calming waterfall—it's familiar and it's relaxing. For us guys, that used be called ""the next Arnold Schwarzenegger action flick."" When we approach genre films, we indeed expect predictability—the familiarity brings the geeks together. In the back of our heads, though, we still want something fresh in there, something that will stay in our minds. A genre film can't be like stale water forever—it'll just go bad.First off, there are enough things that work and to like about this film, the main reason being that you like Steve Carell and Tina Fey—and, well, if you don't like them in this film, the rest of the film won't change your mind. They are predictably likable and just hearing their banter and their chemistry is more fun than the whole ""thriller"" plot that's here. Steve Carell's dead-pan humor compliments well with Tina Fey's sharp wit. There are occasional awkward and sometimes flat jokes, but you will go along with them because you like these guys. The supporting characters, however, don't fair as well. Ray Liotta, as a mob boss, seemed wasted here. Mark Walberg merely plays off his predictable pretty-boy image. William Fichtner, who plays a DA, has a hard time acting around the poor lines he's given.As much as I liked the couple, I just wished they did something more innovative or new with the script. There are occasional moments with a serious tone that I think could've been explored more, and in those moments, Fey and Carell bring a lot of heart, but after a while, the film falls back into comedic predictability.The progress of the story is predictable if you've seen many thrillers. There are crooked cops, politicians, and some secret disk. The thriller aspect, well, isn't suspenseful at all--a problem with the whole comedy-thriller genre itself. It's a balance of opposites, and except in rare cases, you usually lose one or the other. There are some moments here that took me out of the film that would only work in a comedy and not in real life, which brought down the whole ""suspense"" element. In essence, no one would worry that these two would be in any real danger. The film is generally a comedy, with some action thrown in. It's kind of like Steve Carell's Get Smart, minus the gadgets.Overall, one can enjoy this film simply for watching Steve Carell and Tina Fey having fun and being themselves. The script isn't innovative—the plot is a throwaway, and there are other similar films that I've liked that I'd prefer over this film, but there are some fun, if cliché, moments here. The film didn't bring any complex ideas about life or marriage in general, but it still makes for a fun-enough date night. ** ½ out of **** stars.For updates on my movie articles, you can also follow me on http://twitter.com/d_art",Date Night
134,Legendary_Badass,"Carell and Fey have excellent chemistry, a match made in comedy heaven",8,9 April 2010,"Phil (Steve Carell) and Claire (Tina Fey) Foster are a couple in their 40s, mulling through the rat race and raising young children. They have a once a week ritual that keeps them together, and just so happens to be the namesake of the film. With news that their close friends are getting a divorce: Phil decides to up the anti and splurge on an expensive date at the trending Claw in downtown New York City. The two don't have reservations so when the opportunity presents itself, they lie about their identities to score a table only to be thrown into a mess because some thugs believe they have a Flash Drive that contains incriminating evidence. With the help of Mark Walberg as intelligence expert Holbrooke, our heroes evade death and set out to find the Flash Drive and so they can put this whole lie behind them.Carell and Fey have excellent chemistry, a match made in comedy heaven. Both handle lower key humor effectively. One great scene involves their dinner time game of spying on couples at neighboring tables and putting words in their mouths. The outtakes, which roll at the credits, illustrate how these were ad-libbed. They get their feet wet with physical comedy as well dodging bullets, walking into drawers, . They seem like an actual couple and it's great to see them together on screen.There's a ton of known talent playing supporting roles and cameos and most of them could have used more screen time. Taraji P. Henson doesn't have much to do as Detective Arroyo and James Franco maybe this is your worst performance since Spider-Man 3. The talented Olivia Munn and Leighton Meester have even smaller roles. It's upsetting to see star power mishandled in this manner. I'd rather see these roles go to undiscovered, hard working, actors who would see the opportunity as a major break.Unfortunately much of the 3rd act becomes a running gag over Mark Walberg not wearing a shirt. Hey Marky Mark: it's not 1993! This long winded joke isn't quite scoring the same impact it would have.Date Night comes from director Shawn Levy, who you may be familiar with from the Night at the Museum movies. And in a similar manner there are some quality action comedy derived moments to go along with witty repartee. There's one stunt that involved two cars fused together that provides laughs and thrills.As much fun as I was having during the first half, with a grin stretched wide across my face, I couldn't but help to bear less teeth as the movie waned to a conclusion. Whatever purpose the Walberg running gag served, I'm certain it outstayed its welcome. The same goes for a dance the couple performs at a club, again having a laugh surrounded by padding.There's a line where Phil remarks that they should skip tonight's movie, almost suggesting not seeing Date Night on a date night. That's a bold statement for a movie that is chick flick enough for the average female, has a good car chase sequence, and comedy with broad appeal.",Date Night
135,nexus-37,Pretty good comedy with actually some thought,8,16 April 2013,"Long time a movie that made me laugh out loud. This isn't masterpiece or anything, just little different kind of comedy for a while.Basically the story like you can read from the plot (and name of the movie..) Couple is getting little bored with same routines every day, nothing ever changes. Then it does.In the beginning I got lots of laughs and there were several really funny scenes at the restaurants, when couple knows each other so well and everything is kind of simple to both of them.Then this movie gets pretty crazy.This long ""date night"" (what is really funny every week one date night and same restaurant...) gets lot funnier when they decide simply to go to the CITY this time, everything messes up.Dialogue and acting is very good, directing isn't bad either. Not too much stupid jokes there comes along something new all the time. Some jokes are more than one time used but it doesn't matter.I liked it and best of all this wasn't one of those too romantic comedies that I don't like so much, its just simple normal bored couple getting nuts and everything changes.Worth of watch if you usually get jokes in comedies which don't use every zillion times used simple jokes, more like intellectual and acting makes it even funnier when you see those faces during dialog and some stuff like that.

136,MatthewLong23,very funny entertaining film,8,10 April 2010,"This is a very funny comedy vehicle for Tina Fey and Steve Carrel to star in together because it is both ridiculous and allows them to spew one liners in almost every scene. The story is about a boring New Jersey couple who find out their friends are getting divorced because there's no spark in their life. That prompts them to do something different for date night by attempting to go to a popular New York restaurant, where they say your welcome when they answer the phone and it takes months to get a reservation. They decide to be a little risky and pretend they are another couple. While at dinner they find out the people they are impersonating stole a flash drive from a well known mobster, which causes them to do things they normally wouldn't do such as breaking into a store and stealing a car. Mark Wahlberg has a very funny role in it as a guy who doesn't believe in shirts and makes Steve Carrel self conscious about his image and Tina Fey a giddy school girl. There isn't too much action in this film but has a really cool car chase near the end. You will probably enjoy this film if you like these two actors",Date Night
137,Supachewy,A Disappointing Film From Two of the Funniest Actors of Today,5,11 September 2010,"The comedy film Date Night is directed by Shawn Levy and stars Steve Carell and Tina Fey. It takes place in modern day New York City.The film starts off with the average couple, Phil and Claire Foster (Carell and Fey), and how they live out their average lives doing their jobs and taking care of the kids. They go on hundreds of date nights eating the same things every time and things have become ordinary. But when Phil finds out his good friend is getting divorced he decides to try and spice things up with Claire and takes her to a fancy restaurant in New York City. At the restaurant there are no tables open unless they had made a reservation so they steal someone else's reservation who wasn't there. Two men approach them and bring them outside demanding for a flash drive which they don't have because they are not the people they are looking for. And that is when all the jokes miss and another hour of ridiculous pursuit.The screenplay for this film was decent. Many of the jokes in the film missed but I think mostly that was due to the delivery of them. Every now and then something unrealistic happened such as the bad guys shooting at them from forty feet away when they could have easily just walked up to them and shot them at point blank range. There were many clever lines in the film but I thought the beginning could have been juiced up more. I mean there were many chuckle jokes throughout the film but no burst out laughing jokes. The writing was not the weakest part of the film but it could have been improved.The direction for the film was weak and it is why I believe the film failed. It just didn't really connect me to the film. The problem may be that Levy is used to doing kids movies and has now made one for adults. Most great comedies are great because it has great comedic direction and this one just didn't have that. It is all in the reaction shots and that is where the film lacked, the only part where it did have good reaction shots was when it was Carell, Fey, and Wahlberg. Now Levy did do an alright job working with his actors, but then again this film will not be remembered in the long run.The acting in this film was mediocre. Carell and Fey are two of the biggest comedians there are right now so going into this film I expected a lot and left disappointed. They had their moments but it was nothing like the prime of ""The Office"" or the prime of ""30 Rock"". The film just doesn't live up to their careers. The supporting cast was quite good though. The best scene of the film was with James Franco and Mila Kunis. That was probably the only time I really laughed. The scenes with Wahlberg were also good but I thought they could have been improved as well.Overall I give this film a 5/10. I would recommend it to anyone that is a fan of the comedy genre.",Date Night
138,GLanoue,Tina Fey makes Steve Carell likable.,7,21 February 2011,"A contemporary remake of After Hours (1985), with an ordinary suburban couple trapped in mistaken identity hell in Manhattan, this film actually works well, largely because the script is pretty good, and Tina Fey has great on-screen chemistry with Steve Carell, saving him from his usual screaming histrionics. Lots of running gags (Mark Wahlberg's pecs), an original car chase scene (two cars locked together), great supporting cast (especially Mila Kunis and James Franco as a couple of grifters) and fast pacing make it all work. No one stands out except Tina Fey, and she can more than hold her own against scene stealers like Ray Liotta. Luckily, Carell tones it down just enough to let her have the spotlight most of the time, and the result works. This relatively straightforward comedy is actually funny enough to elicit some laughs. Won't mention any scenes in particular, but who knew Tina Fey had such great legs?",Date Night

Having read most of the reviews I am amazed that anyone could find this even remotely 'raunchy' or have their jaw 'dropped' by the lame and pathetic pole dance scene. Part of the problem, I think, and this is a very big part, is that Fey and Carell are a distinctly American taste which doesn't travel. This is the sort of comedy which the French could have done much, much better and it would have been genuinely sexy and funny. Nothing saves it so a very low score.",Date Night

It can be fun in some spots but also straining for laughs in others. Steve Carrel tried too hard to be funny. He is a funny guy but sometimes he just fell flat. Steve and Tina Fey do have great chemistry. I liked Tina in the movie. She had some good lines.They play a married couple who are trying to ignite their weekly date night from the same old song and dance routine. They go to a fancy place called the Claw where it is impossible to get a reservation. Steve steals a reservation from another couple and he and Tina pretend to be them. It turns out to be a mistake when they find out that this couple is in trouble. Soon Steve and Tina are on the run from some bad people who think they are the couple that has a flash drive they want. It contains some incriminating information.The best scenes are a car chase that gets better and better as it speeds along and when Steve and Tina go to a club and do a pole dance. Mark Wahlberg was good also. He is definitely different in it from what you normally see him do. He plays an acquaintance of Tina who tries to help her and Steve get out of the mess they got themselves in to.Date Night sort of reminded me of the movie After Hours with Griffen Dunn when he goes out one night and it turns out to be a night from hell. All he wants to do is get home. The same with Steve and Tina. All they want to do is get home and forget the night even happened. Well, if you can wait, choose Date Night for movie night at home.

Although the film has its funny moments, the plot is mostly unbelievable and stupid. There are some real flaws in this film: 1. The bad guys take Steve Carell's character's wallet. How is the couple getting around without any money? Tina Fey's character doesn't even carry a purse. A real woman doesn't go anywhere without a purse! 2. The couple is trying to escape the goons that are trying to kill them and their clothes get all messed up by falling down and climbing over a wall. In the next scene they both looked perfectly well groomed and clean. How did they manage that? 3. In the last scenes when the bad guys are being caught, Steve Carell's character has miraculously attached a wire and recording device to his body. When exactly did he set that up with the police without his wife knowing about it? They were never apart for a moment. Also, the scenes with the interlocked cars chasing through Manhattan are simply ridiculous. If anyone finds that funny, they must be 12 years old! I would have called the movie Much Ado About Nothing, but that would be an insult to Mr. Shakespeare.",Date Night
145,mjk280,Pretty good if you ARE a boring married couple,5,24 October 2010,"I didn't think this movie was anything special, but the problem is I'm an unmarried 20- something with no kids. If there's one big flaw the movie has it's that it completely nails humor that's intended for people that mirror the main characters: Married people that work their tails off, come home only to have to attend to their kids all evening, and rarely have any real fun. The people I just described probably think the movie was a success for that reason and that's fine, but I think overall it hurts the movie somewhat because it alienates every single other demographic.Most of the jokes are ""cute"" but they're devoid of any type of edge or uniqueness. For people that don't get out much they're clever and unusual. For people that hear a lot of comedy and appreciate originality and intelligence they're pretty stale and safe. That doesn't mean I think the jokes sucked, again I just think they were intended for one group of people.I like both Tina Fey and Steve Carrell. Here I think Carrell is 'meh' and Fey could've been replaced with just about anyone. It wasn't their fault though. Carrell wasn't given enough to do when you consider he's pretty talented. Fey is just......hardly used. Obviously she has a lot of lines but again anyone could have taken her place. I noticed she didn't write this movie and I can't believe she wasn't thinking of how she would change a lot of jokes. She's a really good writer. All in all, nothing special but I will say it moved quickly and wasn't boring in any spots. The run time is just right at about an hour and a half. Not overbearing at all. Some plot points were ridiculous but who cares? It's just a fun little movie.

The script was silly, more for a 12-13 year old, if at that. There were so many ridiculous plot twists that I just tuned out. It seemed so unrealistic although the plot itself was feasible. It could have been a very smart,witty movie, but stupidity was all around,in the dialogue,the strip bar scene,their dancing,and even the car chase.

147,Caribstu,"Not quite awful, just terrible",2,7 September 2010,"I saw the trailer for this film and thought that with two big names, Steve Carell and Tina Fey it would become an instant box office hit. However, not being a fan of Steve Carell as his films are generally farcical plus he ruined 'The Office' (side note; the Americans call Rikky Gervais' ""The Office"" the 'UK version'. It's not a 'version' at all, it's the original, and if you're British and you've watched the 'US version' it completely misses the point of Gervais' comedic masterpiece and Carell is simply awful). But feeling for a good laugh we opted for Date Night, and I expected Tina Fey ( the US's 'version' of Ronnie Ancona and famous for her Sarah Palin impersonation) to be good.First of all there's little point deconstructing a comedy because there is nothing profound about them, the plot can be stupid, the dialogue poor, the acting weak none of which matters when a film makes you burst your sides with laughter. Date Night manages to achieve all those things, except unfortunately the laughing part, that's the one thing Date Night doesn't do. Because it's not funny you then begin to pick holes in the ridiculous story line, attack the bad acting, the stupidity of scenes such as the dance scene in the night club simply felt that the story boarders and director had thought ""Ok.. How do we get from here to hereooh.. I know lets"" and it's just so embarrassingly bad as a scene, there is simply nothing funny about it. I honestly cannot imagine how that scene didn't end up on the cutting room floor.What really stood out for me in this film was that had the director cast Ethan Hawke and Charlize Theron for example you would perceive the film as a whimsical action film that's not taken itself too seriously and actually forgive all the negatives, they wouldn't have mattered. Because however, they cast Steve Carell and Tina Fey you expect it to be funny and it just doesn't deliver, making it quite pathetic. This is emphasised when for some unknown reason the director inserts several scenes that are supposed to be profound, sentimental and touching which do absolutely nothing for the comedic aspect of the film and if anything make it slightly more schizophrenic than it already is. Carrel is not funny neither is Tina Fey who disappears into a roll any female actress could have played, Ray Liota probably cashed the cheque and ran ( need I mention that Mark Wahlberg is as wooden as ever?). I may be being a bit harsh because this is ultimately an inoffensive pointless piece of nonsense that the majority of people could quite happily watch and exit the cinema feeling good and happy about it but to put it in context, it's supposed to be a comedy film and there were two moments when I laughed out loud, one was the escape by boat on the lake, the other were the out takes during the end credits and for a 1 hour 40 minute so called comedy that's really quite dire.2/10",Date Night
148,mysteriesfan,"Talented performers, woefully weak material",2,19 April 2010,"I missed the Amy Poehler-Tina Fey movie of some years ago, so I did not want to miss what promised to be another dream team of comedy talents in Date Night. Maybe the mixed reviews of both films should have warned me. Still, the idea of droll, down-to-earth comedians Steve Carrell and Tina Fey in an action-adventure farce seemed inspired. Well, they were likable and tried to bring some wit and energy to the movie. But the material let them and the audience down badly.The movie began with some quick scenes at home and with friends meant to show how married life could come to feel boring and meaningless (friends suddenly announce their divorce and that they merely feel like ""excellent roommates""). When accountant Carrell tries to break out of the mold with his real estate agent wife Fey on a night out of their New Jersey routines at a trendy Manhattan restaurant, the couple ends up taking another couple's reservation. The other couple is involved in blackmail and is being chased by thugs. Mistaking Carrell and Fey for the other couple, the thugs abduct them at gunpoint and chase them throughout the rest of the movie. Along the way, Carrell and Fey are caught up in loud car chases and quirky meetings and conversations with themselves and others, including big-name actors in cameos, such as a dim, shirtless, hunk security expert (Mark Wahlberg) and a mean mob boss (Ray Liotta). We learn that Fey does not ""light up"" for Carrell the way she does for the hunk because she is so tired taking care of everyone and everything else day in and day out and just wishes she had some time to herself (Fey has a nice line about wanting to enjoy a day that does not somehow depend on how someone else around her is doing). For his part, Carrell says he wants his wife to have more confidence in him and let him shoulder more home and family responsibilities. In a hasty, contrived, anticlimactic ending on a rooftop with everyone pointing guns at each other and the cliché of the police helicopter swooping in at the last minute, Carrell is made out to be the hero.Parts of the dialogue and scenes with the divorcing friends (Mark Ruffalo and Kristen Wiig, good in the roles) and with Carrell and Fey having a heart-to-heart talk had some originality, silly fun, and emotional truth to them. Fey sometimes shot out an unexpectedly earthy line that was funny, and Carrell had some funny moments trying to act and talk tough, as did the two of them making up stories mocking other diners in the restaurants with them. The blackmailing couple was humorously offbeat in the fairly short scene in which they appear.But this was far too little to carry a movie, even one this short. In fact, the material would not even compress well into a good Saturday Night Live skit. The Out-of-Towners, with Steve Martin and Goldie Hawn, is certainly not one of my favorite movies, but it is an insult to compare that fuller, livelier film to this one. The closest comparison to Date Night that I can think of in terms of my surprise and disappointment is Dana Carvey's disastrous 2002 film Master of Disguise.Rarely have I seen a movie with as much on-camera talent turn out to be as skimpy and superficial as Date Night. The story was paper-thin. Never once did I laugh out loud. There were long stretches of dead time, filled with unfunny rambling (as when the couple are led in the park by thugs), with drawn-out and unoriginal cameos (especially by Liotta, who did not have a single funny line or action), and with noisy chase scenes (including a car chase that went on and on repetitively, endlessly trying to milk supposedly funny lines from a cab driver). Even the scene with Carrell and Fey on a stripper pole lost whatever novelty it had fast and came off as drawn-out and forced. The ending, in which Carrell supposedly proved himself to his wife, fell completely flat, without being the least bit clever, interesting, or believable. Much of the plot and gags felt recycled.There were problems even with Fey and Carrell. Her flat detachment and his nerdy, gushing boyishness never came together to make them convincing as a seasoned working suburban couple or gave them much on-screen chemistry or rapport. The supporting characters of the thugs and police were weak, especially the all-knowing, glib policewoman who seemed on to the bad guys from the start, sapping any suspense. The bad guys, who included some corrupt cops and a sleazy political figure who hung out stoned in strip clubs while promising in public to clean up crime, are stock characters with nothing original or interesting about them. The same is true of the unfunny out-takes pasted onto the end credits, which, as another reviewer said, only suggest the cast had a lot more fun making the movie than the audience had watching it.I wanted to like this movie as much as any of the breathlessly enthusiastic reviews on this site. But like other, better reviews, no matter how much I liked the stars and saw bits and pieces here and there to enjoy, there is no way to paper over how disappointing it was.",Date Night

But then I decided to give it a go on a Sunday night, to round off the weekend (usually the time reserved for not very sophisticated stuff).Well, the two characters, though likable, do a lot of stupid things, I must admit. But they do it in such a way that they extracted some really good laughs out of me, making the whole ride totally enjoyable.

151,valis666,"It was Date Night for me, too",5,22 April 2010,"Most of the good things here involve both the humor and sadness in Carell and Fey's stale, domesticated relationship. They're both consumed with work and family, there's no spark in their romance, they can barely even muster up the enthusiasm to go on their regularly scheduled date night, and to top it off, their best friends are getting a divorce. A fair number of genuinely funny (and sometimes uncomfortable) jokes play off of this, and even some pathos. This should have been the focus of the entire movie.Most of the bad things here involve the ridiculous action movie plot that seems shoehorned in for the ADD generation, just in case they couldn't go 15 minutes without a car chase or shootout. It's a brainless plot where two thugs assume Carell and Fey have the microfilm... excuse me, flash drive, because they took the dinner reservations of the person who really has it.

Both movies is about a couple who's trying to enjoy a night out, but ends up in big trouble. These two movies would be an easy comparison, but an easier comparison, is The Lovebirds.As I said in the beginning, the casting is amazing. I like Steve Carell a lot. He's very funny after watching him in The Office, Get Smart, and The 40-Year-Old Virgin. I haven't actually seen Tina Fey a lot. I have seen her in some movies, but I haven't seen 30 Rock yet. In other roles, we have Mark Wahlberg, Taraji P. Henson, James Franco, Mila Kunis, Mark Ruffalo, Kristen Wiig, Jimmi Simpson, Common, William Fichtner, and Leighton Meester amongst many others. There is a lot of cameos too, but I won't spoil them.I really enjoyed watching this film, but ends up a little bit empty in my head.

The movie was funny, but I only wish Tina Fey would have written it because it probably would've been 10 times funnier. The characters were funny, the story was straightforward but consisted of quite a fun bunch of characters, especially that District Attorney, who was kinda a sexual freak!

I read the reviews on here after watching the movie and find it difficult to believe that many of these reviews can be genuine because I was firmly in agreement with the people who hated it.It seemed like the film went on forever although it actually lasted for about 80 minutes. I just kept thinking 'Please end' and let me get down the pub. I hope that Tina Fey chooses her next movie more carefully because her talent is above this unfunny rubbish. The same goes for Carell before he gets tagged with appearing in unfunny turkeys.

A solid 9 stars, pretty brilliant!",Date Night
156,MrPink08,Date Fright,2,16 April 2010,"How exactly can you mess up a movie with Steve Carrell and Tina Fey as your main stars? Both are stars of two of the best shows on TV (I love Carrell's The Office, but I'm not a fan of Fey's 30 Rock) and have played their share of memorable characters on the big screen (Carrell as a weatherman who can't think in Anchorman and Fey as a teacher in Mean Girls) but when they share the screen for Date Night, they are ruined by trying to make a weak script funny.Carrell and Fey play the Fosters, a boring New Jersey couple. The opening scenes where they introduce the Fosters are lagging and boring. Things should pick up when they go to New York for a fancy dinner and Carrell takes another couple's table, leading to series of misadventures for the poor couple. Due to a case of mistaken identity, they are caught up in a scheme involving crooked cops and gangsters. Needless to say, this barely makes any sense.Usually, I'm all for celebrity cameos, but Date Night took it too far. Mila Kunis, Leighton Meester, Mark Wahlberg, James Franco, William Fitchner, and Ray Liotta all make cameos. Wahlberg's cameo is very amusing, but the rest are either dumb (Fitchner), pointless (Meester), or too brief (Kunis, Franco and Liotta). Your focus should be on Carrell and Fey, but instead you're going star watching for half the movie. The cameo loses its so called ""sacredness"" when nearly every bit part is played by an A-lister.Overall, Date Night could've been hilarious but is brought by its weak script and dumb plot. For your next date night, do yourself a favor and don't subject yourself to Carrell and Fey's.",Date Night

Phil and Claire Foster (Steve Carell and Tina Fey) desperately needed to put a spark back into their marriage. After learning their close friends were getting a divorce, they decide to make their date night a special one. They head into Manhattan and steal a reservation at the newest hip seafood joint. The night is a success and they have a great time until 2 men interrupt their dinner. They are mistaken for another couple who have gotten themselves in some kind of mess. Madness ensues.I found this movie very entertaining. There were a few moments of dialogue that portrayed their marriage as the inevitable routine couples accept. Ultimately, time and energy is spent on working and raising children without reserving any to keep the fire burning. It was heartwarming, but I was mostly having a knee-slapping good laugh. Tina Fey is hilarious as always. Tip for the ladies: Girls like funny guys, but guys like funny girls too. Steve Carell is on par with all his other performances. He's well equipped with plenty of signature ad libbed one-liners including ""Whore!"" and ""Shut your vagina!"". The dynamic duo even hit the dance floor grinding on each other in a robotic fashion.

In this comedy of errors laughter begins with Phil taking the reservation of the Tripplehorn's a no-show at a swanky new restaurant. Unbeknownst to them the couple they are pretending to be are in the cross hairs of a local gangster. The Tripplehorn's are blackmailing the gangster with information saved on a flash drive.

With the help of a former client of Claire's Holbrooke Grant (Mark Wahlberg) must find the flash drive, figure out a way to escape the gangster and the politician and get back home to their suburban lives.Watching the outtakes during the credits make me wonder how much of this movie was scripted.

These films keep you interested even when nothing important to the story is actually happening on screen. However, some films rely solely on charm and chemistry between co-stars for success. Date Night is not the first film, it looks slick and vacant of anything worth watching except for it's two stars. As casting goes, Date Night does keep you interested with the excellent pairing of Fey and Carell as a married couple. While the script struggles to provide enough clever banter to satisfy, their chemistry and ad-libs are what keeps the film going. Marky Mark, William Fichtner, Mila Kunis and James Franco show up for some pretty funny cameos, while Ray Liotta looks like he stumbled off the set of whatever his last crappy movie was and didn't step out of character.

So, the husband decides to take on the name of another guest to get a table for dinner in their place. Unbeknownst to him and his wife, the name of the people from whom he chose to take a table are on the Hit List of a Local Mafioso who wants a USB Drive that contains incriminating information about a Senator and the Mafioso himself.

162,filmbantha,Harldy an ideal date but still enjoyable,7,20 April 2010,"Imagine if True Romance was a light-hearted Romantic Comedy where two lovers become entangled in a web of crime and you will not be far off the mark. Date Night is remarkably similar to True Romance in terms of plot but replaces the style and panache of Tarantino's writing with slapstick humour and bumbling criminals. However, don't let that get your hopes up, True Romance is a classic, Date night is mere popcorn fodder despite being surprisingly enjoyable.Tina Fey and Steve Carell play the Fosters, a hapless couple whose marriage is on its last legs, and when their attempt to rekindle the flame goes awry they are mistaken for two thieves who have stolen from one of New York's leading crime lords - and he is not a happy man. Throughout their eventful date night the Foster's are thrown into one unbelievable situation after another and while most are amusing, some fall flat, but the excellent cameos are sure to keep you entertained when the humour dries up. In fact, Shawn Levy should be glad that he managed to recruit such an appealing cast; the performances improve on what would otherwise be a lacklustre comedy. Steve Carell shines as Phil Foster, with his warped sense of humour and deadpan acting, and Mark Wahlberg is excellent as the ex colleague who comes to the aid of the Fosters. Most of the humour comes from Carell's performance, he is on his usual top form, and fans of Anchorman and the 40 Year old Virgin will not be disappointed. As he gains confidence throughout the night, Phil Foster gradually regains the love and trust of his wife, it's the usual cliché but here it actually works, and you can't help but empathise with the endearing couple.If Date Night was any longer, it would have dragged but thankfully the snappy pacing coupled with a relatively short running time of 88 minutes was perfect for this style of comedy, and funnily enough would make it a perfect film to take a potential partner to see.Let's say Date Night is a female friend; I certainly enjoyed spending an evening with her, and it would have been even better with a few drinks. I might save her number, but only with the intention of seeing her again if nothing else was on the cards. In other words, check it out but don't get your hopes up!If you liked this film you will also enjoy these:The 40 Year Old Virgin, True Romance, The Apartment, The Naked Gun Trilogy",Date Night

Steve Carrell is a comedy legend in his own right, but pair him up with the brilliant and witty Tina Fey and you won't stop laughing - guaranteed. The plot is probably not going where you expect it to and it's smarter than you actually think. (f.e.: Mark Wahlberg working for the Mossad could be a whole subplot). I love the fact they made >who takes someone else's reservation< a running gag. The cast was carefully chosen, be it Mila Kunis as an ex-stripper or Ray Liotta as a shady Italian Mafia guy. I don't care about the typical cliché of the corrupt politician, because the whole movie is not to be taken seriously at all.

The relationship between the two main actors was very well portrayed, and, I thought, the funniest part of the movie for much of its realism.Many of the lines were very funny. But also sometimes very crude. Perhaps to be expected, given the actors, but it seemed that often for lack of any real humor, they found it convenient simply to throw in an anatomical reference.They also have a number of well-filmed action sequences, including a very original car chase, filled with both laughter and suspense.The biggest downfall of the movie is the plot. It starts out clear cut enough--mistaken identities, blackmail, bad guy, good guy... But then when it comes to tying it all together, the job gets a little sloppy, and while you may come out of the theater laughing, you may drive home wondering, ""Wait a second...how exactly did that work out?"" I did finally figure some of these loose ends out, but only after deep reflection into earlier parts of the movie. It just wasn't very clear.But, if you would enjoy watching the equivalent of some humorous and well-played comedy skits, tied in with some decent (though not stupendous) action sequences, you'll probably be very happy with the film.In short, I did enjoy the movie (especially the acting by Steve Carell and Tina Fey), but I wish they would have taken the time to secure a better wrap up and cut back on some of the crude.

Aside from the surprising cameos in this show, there aren't much surprises. This is one of those movies where there's a couple that's been in a somewhat fixed circle of boredom in their lives. Heck, even their regular date nights have been very predictable.Steve and Tina are the Fosters; upon finding out that one of their closest couple friends are splitting up, they try to spice things up by having a date in the city. In a case of mistaken identity, their would-be date night winds up an action-filled, sometimes funny evening. Except for a few scenes, this movie isn't anything innovative; but it's still nice to see Steve and Tina play likable characters.The producers of this flick know what they have in these two actors, and the movie is enough to give their comedic and acting chops (nothing like Steve's nice acting ability in Dan in Real Life) a little flexing. With this knowledge, I still recommend this movie to those who want to enjoy a little break from the action-3D-filled movies out there now.

I've seen a couple of the bits and she does nail the impression itself but if her only other role on snl was newsreader on ""weekend update"" (where the marginally funny comics are relegated) she's really just some forgettable personality with lifeless delivery and without her famous impression would probably be a nobody (in celebrity terms). she seems like the straightman for a comedy duo that's missing the comedian half.so basically if you perceive these two similarly, you won't crack a grin and either be deep asleep in ~15 minutes or stop watching. it's awful. idiotic plot, unfunny people, unfunny writing, no redeeming features at all imo. real boring stuff.otoh if you think one successful impression based in large part on looks alone makes everything she touches funny and that steve carrell can do no wrong, chances are you'll enjoy this movie.I believe it's that simple. if you like them you'll like the movie, if you're ambivalent you won't.",Date Night

Fey and Carrell's improvised performances lose no touch from their other humorous roles. And they play a convincing married couple with children. That was what i was most worried about going into this. With such big stars as Fey and Carrell, I was worried that there would be a naturally unconvincing aura to their relationship, but i was proved wrong. The story is wacky enough to keep you entertained. Without revealing any spoilers, the basic story is Carrell and Fey accept a different couple's reservation at a really expensive restaurant flaming with all the hot styles of the young generation. Trouble brews when two hit men mistake them for the people that got involved with a crime boss and stole his USB with seemingly important information on it. The plot chronicles the different obstacles they face in proving their identity to their chasers and ultimately solving the crime. Date Night has good fun spurting from its pores. Its a good movie to take your family to if your kids are over the age of 10. You wont be disappointed in the money you've spent either buying,renting, or spending it on a ticket. Considering all of this, I must also note that there is nothing noticeably special about the film, no deep meaning, no character revelations, no parallel plots, just good fun.",Date Night

Despite some tepid comments I heard about this film, I wanted to see it because I love 'em so much. How could a movie go wrong with them in it, right? Wrong! What a painful experience. I so wanted to at least like this movie, but even that was asking too much.Let's review the plot. Steve and Tina's characters have an unexciting, sexless marriage. They routinely go on Date-Night every Friday. But nothing happens afterwords. No sex, just sleep. Trying to spark things up, Steve takes his wife to a new, trendy restaurant. There are no seats available, so Steve steals the reservations of some no-shows, pretending they are that couple. Thugs show up, thinking they are them, and a roller coaster ride through the city follows.This could be a great pretext for funny situations. But not with this writer. The movie wasn't funny. While Tina and Steve did the best they could, the material didn't work. The writer didn't know how to set up a joke, and pay if off. Scenes that could have been humorous fell flat. Watching them try to make us laugh with this flat script, and a director who does not have a feel for comedy, was painful.I couldn't wait to get out of the theater, and that was after the first five minutes.

172,ron-sasso,Paper Thin Characters,4,18 October 2012,Date Night has a great premise. Basically a married couple who have settled into their boring life go out on a date and find a series of misadventures with their lives on the line. A similar premise is often used in action movies where an average guy suddenly finds himself up against forces of antagonism because of a mistaken identity. I thought this would be an interesting twist.I was excited to watch this movie. I believed the premise was promising enough that if it was reasonably well-written it would be extremely enjoyable. I thought this was going to be a romantic comedy and prepared for laughs. Unfortunately I didn't find it funny. First of all the characters are paper thin with nothing but stereotypes. I have my doubts that the writer has been married or has had children. Clearly the writer never spent time trying to understand the characters because it was a rare moment when a line would make sense given the little bit of history we had and the background of the characters. The ending was particularly contrived. I can't believe I wasted money on this DVD. It was an incredible disappointment.,Date Night

Date Night is about a boring, married with kids, couple from New Jersey who decide to go on a date in a fancy restaurant in Manhattan. When they take someone else's reservation, a case of mistaken identity kicks in. And from there starts a series of unfortunate and dangerous events on their side and unstoppable laughing on yours.I'm never capable of keeping this inside whenever his name comes up but I'm neither a fan of Steve Carell nor of his idiotic moron comedy. But, as honest as I can ever be, he made me laugh enough in this one to make up for all of his previous performances, at least the ones I've seen. Needless to say, Tina Fey is not just fun to watch, she's undoubtedly one of the funniest women who ever made it to fame. Only a few days ago she has been chosen to receive the Mark Twain Humour Award as the funniest woman in America.And coming from Shawn Levy, director of the two ""Night at The Museum"" movies and writer ""Josh Klausner"" who's behind the latest two Shrek movies, the comedy film audience would expect nothing less than an uproarious show for their money, and they get one. Not only are you fully served by the one and a half hour of Fey and Carell, you also get, not one not two, but four little first-rate comically flavoured toppings; Mark Ruffalo, Mark Wahlberg, James Franco and Mila Kunis. And by the way, the Franco and Kunis scene is undeniably the movie's best.In a nutshell, Date Night presents a good comedy combo of the classic mix-ups, the spontaneous comebacks and the dangerous, yet very funny unfortunate events.

Performances of everyone involved in Date Night are pitch perfect. Like the scene at their initial date night where Tina Fey looks for a second at a kissing couple & her expression says everything about their current relation. In fact every time a new character enters, rest assure laughs guaranteed. The whole intro scene of Mark Wahlberg is super funny. I didn't know that James Franco was in the movie. His & Mila Kunis part & that whole scene was one of the best parts of the movie. There was one good lengthy action piece involving two cars attached to each other. Even in the scenes which are supposed to be calm, the leads made sure that there is not a dull moment with their earnest performances. Their conversations come through honest & interesting in serious scenes & absolutely funny in the comic scenes. Credit & thumbs-up to both director Shawn Levy & the writer Josh Klausner.The only bad thing about the movie was that based on the promos I thought this would be a romcom with slight action but this turned out to be an actioncom with romance. Might be my fault to have a wrong expectation. In an Indian movie, generally you have an interval around the 75 minute mark. Date Night runs for around only 85 minutes & I felt the movie was over in 40 minutes which shows how much I enjoyed it. Oh, I forgot to mention the line which was in every headline about the movie. There is a talk that without this line you can't mention Date Night. Here it comes. Mark Wahlberg has no shirt in the movie. Now my review is complete. You want to target teenage girls. Make Taylor Lautner shed his shirt. You want to attract young women. Make Wahlberg shed his shirt. You want to attract old women. Make ________ shed his shirt. You can fill in the blank in the comments.There was not an yawn inducing moment in the movie & the grin never left my face right from the very first scene to the last kiss scene at the end credits. Gosh! I would love a sequel.My advice to the couples. Go to the movie. You'll enjoy this unless you hate Tina Fey. Then go to a restaurant & start imitating the people there.Finally I have a couple of messages. Tina Fey, if you ever read this, I love you (sorry Jeff). Oscar organizers, let Tina Fey be the host next year, pleeeease.",Date Night

Needless to say, it did not disappoint me one bit! It was extremely funny, and when I say that I mean laugh out loud giggling 5 minutes later funny. Some of the scenes were just that great!It was smart and simple and heartwarming. It mixes a great a likable humor that is kind of unpredictable and really fun! The protagonists of this story are equally likable and silly. This is a great and underrated movie that I could enjoy again and again!",Date Night

I wasn't a big Tina Fey fan, but she was really quite funny, and of course Steve Carell was great. The plot and the dialogue were both hilarious through and through, but what really sets it apart is that anyone can watch it and enjoy it. Whatever genre you like - comedy, romantic comedy, action - it'll keep you entertained. It was a bit reminiscent of ""Get Smart,"" a perfect blend of action-adventure and comedy. Very funny, yet at the same time suspenseful. It's not really meaningful, like ""Oh, my God, I'm a different person now that I've seen this,"" but it's a lot of fun.",Date Night
177,nataliecellini,Fun Movie,9,1 March 2021,"Steve Carell and Tina Fey are my favorite actors so I had to check this out. While the story line is pretty simple and kind of predictable, I loved this movie.Phil and Claire foster are middle-class married couple from New Jersey with two kids, who's marriage has gotten boring. Even their date nights are repetitive. One night they decide to mix things up and go to a very popular restaurant in New York City. Without a reservation, Phil steals the reservation of a couple called the Tripplehorns who never show up. While enjoying their dinner, they're interrupted by two men who tell them they need to come outside, and then hold them at gunpoint. It turns out the Tripplehorns are being hunted down for a certain flash drive, and now the two men believe that Phil and Claire are the Tripplehorns. This sends the couple on a wild, action-packed adventure of trying to track down the real Tripplehorns to get out of the whole mess.Steve and Tina are so charming, and they had me rooting for Phil and Claire the entire time. I think they were the perfect two actors for this role. There are lots of funny moments in this movie, including a high speed chase that had me laughing so hard. The ending was cute, with a great message about finding each other again when a relationship gets stuck in a routine. This is a great movie to sit back and relax with, and I really enjoyed it.",Date Night

The review on this one's main page mentions Steve and Tina having a special comedic connection, that they're two of the funniest people in showbiz, and that they rival the best comedic duos of all time.Tina Fey may be the funniest woman in showbiz, I dunno, but I think the rest is kind of a stretch...although I'm not disputing that either of them has their moments.This movie, however, didn't really feel like one of them to me. Don't get me wrong, I liked this movie. It isn't particularly great...it's forgettable even. BUT it is still pretty good in all respects: It doesn't have a stupid script, bad dialogue, and is a well made Hollywood film. I didn't think this movie was very funny, but my standards are high. The gag reel from the credits was better than the movie in terms of laughs. That isn't to say that the movie wasn't amusing, just not laugh out loud so.But as far as a film where a couple wants to have a nice night out and takes other people's reservations at a hard to get into restaurant only to be confused for said people by some seedy elements and crazy antics ensue, it was pretty enjoyable.6.9/10",Date Night

Date night was strongly hyped before release with trailers that showed, as it turned out, the only funny lines in the movie. Steve Carell uses the same cadence, voice tone, expression, and body language as Michael in ""The Office"", and it's just worn out. Tina Fey was Liz Lemon from ""30 Rock"". The plot was silly stupid and inconsistent as it fluctuated between simplistic, labored joke lines and tortured attempts at husband/wife relationship sentimentality. One bright spot comes from J.B. Smoove as the cabbie caught in the middle of the Foster's adventure. His comic timing and delivery is excellent and brings some much needed energy to the story. Ironically Smoove isn't even credited in the movie. Overall, the ""action"" sequences were neither thrilling, nor funny. It was like the producers didn't know what kind of movie they wanted to make, spoof, romance, or action, so they did none of it well. This is a case where all the ingredients just didn't mix well. The fact that the hype was over the top for this movie illustrates how the movie business is on a real quality low again this year.",Date Night

So I tried very hard to laugh, and I succeeded in an early motorboat chase scene and in one little exchange the couple had about whether or not they ought to have sex that night (they don't, of course). But then things went downhill. I had seen the trailer and knew about most of the scenes that were supposed to be funny, so they lacked their punch. And I felt that the two stars had been put in script-straitjackets in terms of their lines and characters. I was bewildered by the large number of positive reviews here on IMDb when I first started to scroll through, but then as I read on, I found more and more people who had experienced the film as I did. It makes me wonder whether the positive reviews are front loaded in order to support certain films? If so, it's a disservice to the moviegoer.

What raises it well above average, however, is the light touch and the genuine heart of the relationship between the two main characters. Steve Carell excels at the under-appreciated task of being a comic everyman, without having to resort to over the top gurning and mugging, and Tina Fey is a worthy partner for him. For many, far too many, recent romantic comedies, the makers seem to think that ""come up with high concept plot device, get two stars together, whether they have an iota of on-screen chemistry or not, and you are done"". ""Date Night"" is that rare creature that understands that even for light comedy, you have to care about the protagonists before you care for the movie.

This is no action film but fellas, you will not notice. It is nor a real drama but ladies, you will love it more. Because there is a perfect mix of real-life-like drama that everyone will identify with and find themselves in and there is just a little action that is mild but so close to real life that makes it easy to suspend your disbelief. And it is all coated, almost sugar-coated but not too much, with great comedy performed by good actors that I will not even try to analyze. Just trust me on this one, if you are married, you will enjoy this movie. Not only that, you will remember it fondly and take something with you. Some will take the funny lines. You will be cracking up, especially if you live in America. Some, definitely if you are a married woman, will take the heartfelt moments. Great work on all accounts.

Well,rent the film to find out. If you're a fan of either star, you will not be disappointed. The duo are close to comic genius in Date Night. It's about time for a film starring comedians to not be completely vulgar or totally ridiculous. There is no need for the level of indecency that tends to be the angle that many comedians take. Fey and Carrell are able to master that ever elusive perfect blend of perverted innuendos, clever quips, and physical humor. Their chemistry and timing are great as well.

Steve Carell is also very funny and the chemistry between the two is very significant and indeed important for the film to work. And it sure works. Now could the film have been better and have had a tighter script and punch-lines? Sure. But the beauty of this film is that it is not funny to be funny per say. It's quite obvious that the crew has improvised a great deal throughout the film and it shows. So instead of ""just being funny"" it's smart and lively and it has a certain authenticity to it although its purpose obviously is to entertain and make people laugh. Naturally it follows the traditional ways of building a story and evidently it is quite American, but it works.

The rest of us can laugh at the clever lines and the intelligently absurd situations in such films...and in Date Night. A couples intervention at gunpoint for two low-life thieves? A flustered ex-CIA Special Operative whose evening of sexual athletics is repeatedly interrupted? A husband and wife who entertain themselves at restaurants by making up dialog for the other diners?

It constantly circles around a stupid date night that basically leaves you on the doorstep once again. Now if that was the mission, then it was most defiantly dull. The action of the movie was terrible. It was not smoothly portrayed. Too much busy scenes equals a lost appetite and 9 bucks out. I do not recommend this movie for a date night in any way.

I think this may be how they come up with the idea of this film too, that how wild and crazy can a long awaited night could have been like. Hence the crazy stuffs of the story.I like it particularly about the scene they met the real couple who took the flash drive. Life unstable and poor can be yet more satisfying than the good old fashioned life style of the Fosters. Shallow as it is, the passion in that couple may shed some light on married people who just looked for mindless jokes in this movie.But you must not overvalued this movie.

However, after reading quite a few good reviews of it, I decided to check if my prejudice had been correct. I have been a fan of Steve Carell & Tina Fey for some time, owing to their performances in The Office & 30 Rock. Alas, what they do in this movie is nothing even comparable to what they have achieved on the small screen. The movie is based around The Fosters, a simple family with the basic family problems: too much work, less time with family, a mechanical and repetitive routine, a boring life, annoying kids etc. The movie follows the predictive plot of this couple going out for a quiet evening which steam rolls into a supposedly crazy wild adventure.Don't get me wrong, I don't mean to complain about the plot. Its a standard comic flick and not some thriller. I don't expect a revolutionary story but I do expect a few good laughs from the movie which it definitely failed to give me. It mostly comprised of 10yr old kids' level jokes and a whole lot of overacting. But to be fair, I must mention the acting was terrible on almost everyone's part and not just the main star cast.Maybe its just because of so many movies following the average-person-goes-super path, that this seems so boring and unworthy of spending 2hrs on, but the fact is that people expect more of such a great cast. From corny 1 liners to repeated jokes (Mark Wahlberg's shirt uhhh....), if the things were not overdone so much, the movie may not have been this bad. But nevertheless, I guess I went for this movie with way too much expectations due to the cast. Watch it if you love the leads and have time to kill for some so-so jokes.

This leads into one zany event after another throughout the city and a cast of supporting characters that includes James Franco, Ray Liotta, and Mark Whalberg.Director Shaun Levy, whose credits include the Night at the Museum films, offers enough fluid pace and direction to keep the film moving in a timely manner, but many of the best scenes in the film occur before the wild night on the town. Just Carell and Fey being their comedic selves in ordinary situations would have been more entertaining than a would-be, disappointing action comedy.",Date Night
208,redhoss,I still can't believe how bad this movie is,1,26 February 2012,"I'm still stunned by how awful this movie is, on about the same level as a low budget TV sitcom. Un-funny, unintelligent, uninteresting. Fey and Carrel will look back on this movie as their biggest professional embarrassment. I realize ensemble cast extravaganzas like this are frequently bad but this movie is so insultingly, unrelentingly poorly written and directed that not even Tina Fey's considerable hotness could keep me from cringing at the lameness of the plot and dialog. Don't even think about 30-Rock or The Office if you're considering watching this movie...think in terms of Fey and Carrel being forced at gunpoint to participate in a movie that was specifically produced by the Al-Qaida to be so unrelentingly lame and uninspired that it would serve to depress and demoralize the American population into unconditional surrender.",Date Night
209,Henke_1991,Not worth being called a comedy,4,8 June 2010,"If you have seen Steve Carell in The Office(TV-Series) and liked his character Michael Scott, you will certainly not like him in this movie. This film as a pretty interesting plot and I would rather have it as a action/thriller movie. This is this sad. Of course some of you will like the comedy in this film, if you like brain dead jokes etc, maybe you'll like it.I watched this primarily because Steve Carell was in it, big mistake. If you have a choice to watch another movie, go with the other one! Maybe this can be good a rainy Sunday when you just lie in bed and is dieing from boredom but not under any other circumstances.I literally fell asleep while watching this. That's how funny it was!",Date Night
210,plikistheone,Is this it?,2,23 April 2010,"Date Night starts off by showing us 2 nobodies who suck at their lives (Tina Fey and Steve Carell) trying to spice up their crappy marriage by going on dates. On one of them, they take someone else's reservation and get into trouble and the hilarity ensues when they're starting to get chased by two crooked policemen, which sounds all well and good. In theory.The thing is, nothing in this so-called comedy is pulled off right. The main characters are mind numbingly stupid (*SPOILER*how to get into a restricted club? Pretend you're a 'pimp daddy' and 'whore' while looking like bums and making use of bad slang as awkwardly as possible*SPOILER*), yet so is everyone else in the movie (*CONTINUED SPOILER*the bouncer of said club actually falls for it*SPOILER*), but this isn't where the stupidity ends. The whole plot is full of it.The comedic timing is bad and the jokes are lame, and even James Franco, at first a pleasant surprise, managed to get screwed up and did a textbook performance of 'how movie references are not done'. Maybe part of what was supposed to be funny was the awkwardness of the main characters, but believe me, the more awkward they get, the more you'll start cringing. Yet the movie thinks you're laughing and going forward with jokes that are straight up worst of the decade.The plot itself is extremely predictable - only in one sense though, because you don't expect some of the even stupider plot turns. A very big disappointment, because during the hour and thirty minutes of cringing it got 2 small chuckles out of me. Obvious cash-in, nothing to see here.If I was to find a good thing about the movie at a gunpoint, it would be Mark Wahlberg, which is why this movie receives 2/10.",Date Night
211,rufi-4,What was that?,1,12 July 2012,"I couldn't suspend my disbelief while watching this movie. The plot and events are just not believable. The reaction of the characters to the events is not realistic. The relationship between Carell and Fey was the only thing that kept me slightly interested. The jokes fell flat way too often and a lot of the dialog was just so poorly written. All these times that they try to convince someone to let them in somewhere just don't make any sense. At Mark Wahlberg's place or at the strip-club or even to the private area of the strip-club. What was that?Who wrote this garbage and how can these actors not hire agents who filter out these terrible projects? A bunch of solid comedy actors in one movie doesn't make a good movie if the writing is so bad. They did their normal semi-funny acting but unless you put it all together with a good story and some good directing, it really falls flat.",Date Night
212,revencraig,More left to give.,5,8 June 2010,"OK, a decent movie, however there was entirely too much sexual innuendo and outlandish moments of cursing that i can do without. I do not enjoy crude movies for the sake of being crude and trying to be funny with it. Carell is funny as usual and Fey as well. So thankful that we didn't have to endure the gay agenda that is given in most movies made today. Overall a good laugh with moments of lingering slow slapstick. Not sure i would recommend it. I enjoyed that fact that the couple showed that real love is deeper than what you do on a date night. Loved the cab driver in the movie and made my wife and I laugh out loud. Had a lot more potential left behind by people a a hurry to get a movie in the theaters. The movie had a great plot and I was ready to laugh my head off, however it never quite got off the ground it seemed. Again Fey and Carell were great as it goes for acting, but i left wanting a little more in the story and humor side of things.",Date Night

It was pretty funny at times but then I fell asleep Rukiya Belagam does not like how much it costs to go to the movies. Based on the outtakes during the credits the movie would have been funnier if they would have been live! A very talented cast deserves better material and this should have been funnier!

I don't think enough time is given to plot and character development in under 90 mins. Well, I was watching the first few minutes of Date Night, and loving it, and restarted it from the beginning when my husband came home. He caught that it was on 87 minutes but I was into it so we continued. I must say, this is probably my fav -90 flick I have seen (although I'm not keeping score). The writing was hilarious, the acting superb, and I really enjoyed all the celeb cameos. It's hard to believe it wasn't 2 full hours let alone only 87 minutes. I can't imagine what hilarity was left on the cutting-room floor. And comedies are not at the top of my list of movie genres. I guess Date Night just did it for me. Watch it and enjoy.",Date Night
215,adreamtonight,A Celebration of Marriage,7,16 May 2010,"This movie should be seen by every married couple. Not because its funny or because its entertaining, but because it makes you turn around to your partner and go ""We should have our own date nights, right? ;)""This story is very cutesy, it features a couple who decide to steal an invitation at a very upscale nightclub/restaurant in New York City and almost end up paying their lives for it. Tina Fey and Steve Carell's acting is not usual in this film, playing the same characters that they have always played in their entire careers. Steve's character, Phil Foster, is a bit like Michael from ""The Office"". He is misunderstood, trying to do his best, all the while repetitively telling Mark Wahlberg's character, Holbrooke, that he should wears a shirt.Mark Wahlberg is excellent at what he does. Mila Kunis and James Franco leave you wanting more, most likely because they do not have enough screen time to develop their characters. The comedy is a bit contrived. It seems like a lot of the scenes where done spontaneously with the actors allowed to ad-lib (you can tell because of the outtakes done at the end). Because of this, a lot of the timing of the jokes are a bit off. There is some physical comedy for the times that actual jokes fail. Overall its a good entertaining movie that you should probably rent rather than go to the movie theater...My take: Rent it Grading: C+/B-This review has been brought to you by: Massiel Emmy Caceres",Date Night

I LOVE Tina Fey, but once again she didn't write it.a total bore... Ray Liottta is invisible. Glad they didn't make it on my dime.Love Mark Wahlbergs body though. Strangely enough Steve and Tina have no chemistry....neither does any one else in this drivel. I am not that picky but this was a total yawn.

After they reluctantly agree to date night, their night is turned upside down when they falsely assume another's reservation. Following is a night including, car chases, gunshots, sexual encounters and other difficult positions that they confront. The good guys win, but this is not the real storyline. It is about how the couple adapt and support each other in these difficult situations. They are typically a nuclear family without major issue except the tedium of life.

Empathizing with the characters was not even possible, they just act plain stupid and senseless. After 30 minutes nothing slightly funny had happened. Steve Carell in the 40 year old virgin, still difficult to empathize with his character, but 100 times more funnier. So if you're really bored and have no alternative movie title laying around.... The movie is also categorized as romantic and in the crime area... so i know it is not 100% a comedy, but still senseless material. Cannot imagine anyone acting this way in real life...maybe Forrest Gump...",Date Night
220,TheJerLogan,Um...no,5,4 May 2010,"I went to this movie with my mom and two grandmas, who laugh at basically anything. I could take them to see ""The Tooth Fairy"" and they would crack up. So maybe my mood was a little enlightened due to the fact that I was sitting next to a bunch of popcorn-eating laughers. Watching this thing alone would make me shut it off in embarrassment.I absolutely love Steve Carell in ""The Office""; he is brilliant in that show. But after seeing films like ""40 Year Old Virgin"" and ""Get Smart"" over the years, I want him to stay on the set of the show and not try to be funny on the big screen. Perhaps his funniest moment in a movie was his character in ""Anchorman"". Don't get me wrong, he is an EXCELLENT actor (""Dan in Real Life"" and ""Little Miss Sunshine"" will prove this), but maybe he should stick to more serious roles, because the ""funny"" scripts he's choosing to be a part of aren't working out. And ""Date Night"" was no exception.The movie is temporarily entertaining, and merely that; there is no character development, no plot surprises. It is just a movie out to get money. A scene I can recall looking down and shaking my head was when Fey and Carell are in a particular car chase and the front of their car is hooked onto another car. And they're driving very dangerously this way. And They don't stop. The scene is extended way too far and by the time it finally ends (as well as the rest of the movie), you're wondering what the focus and objective of the story is because there are just too many distractions.The thing is filled with great actors, all of whom I really like (except Tina Fey). Mark Ruffalo's part flashes by so quickly you can't even tell it's Mark Ruffalo. Maybe he wanted to make this acting venture as little painful as possible. He probably read the script and ran away. Maybe that's what they all should have done.The movie is not completely horrible, there are a few clever moments. But after awhile the ""outsmarting the bad guys and putting them all in jail"" theory gets old. (oops, spoiler alert, my bad)I could be more harsh and severe, but the nice alignment of actors save the movie and make it a little watchable. Let's just put it that way.",Date Night

I went with a bunch of friends and we were laughing the entire time along with the rest of the audience. There is also a fairly good plot, too. It's not just ""funny"". I would recommend this to everyone except for people under 13 because it does have some pretty ""adult"" scenes in it (i.e. strip club, use of certain body part words multiple times, references to sex multiple times). Go see it!Tina Fey is one of my favorite actresses/comedians and she did a fantastic job in this movie. She was funny like she always is. She's a natural for comedy. Steve Carrell also did a fantastic job. They worked great together. Even the back-up actors were good such as the taxi driver and the ""cops"".",Date Night

I understand the value of a well formed romantic comedy, but I feel that this film tried to involve serious romantic moments while promoting itself more as a comedy. The action scenes were rather ridiculous, but I suppose that is to be expected with this type of movie. I thoroughly enjoy Tina Fey in Saturday Night Live, as well as Steve Carell in The Office, and was rather looking forward to them as a duo, but I was ultimately disappointed. The more serious moments of romance between the two seemed forced and fake. I truly laughed for only a small fraction of the movie, but for the rest of it, I was ultimately bored.

Unfortunately, after we get this 10 minutes of watchable, promising footage behind us a schizophrenic plot turn changes the entire character of the movie. It is obvious the original idea could not be sustained long enough and so it lapses into a bizarre crime caper that leaves the viewer wondering what happened. The writers do not even do us the courtesy of a gentle transition and make it worse by trying to make it up with desperate throw-backs to the original premise here and there that are just not believable. Overall, it is a disjointed, tiresome tirade that never quite made the transition from idea to movie.

We were waiting for something, anything funny. Nothing. The plot you've seen before, many times. Nothing believable. Surely when they (Tina and Steve) were making this movie they realized this would be a bomb. If I was at a theater I would have walked out. I think they went for a PG 13 rating by using the f word once. Don't waste your time on this one.

227,hussar-855-581797,What a Horrible Film!!,1,26 September 2010,"This film is absolutely awful. I'll never understand why film-writers of today seem to think that sexual innuendo in its rawest form constitutes good humor. In his review, even Roger Ebert seems to miss this very important point. Though comics like Steve Carroll and Tina Fey have the potential to do good humor, they repeatedly fail, and just like Saturday Night Live has slipped into the unfortunate habit of relying upon frequent use of sexual innuendo (simply repeating the word ""penis"" without a context might be funny to a middle-schooler, but it quickly loses it's charm to the initiated) the writers of this film continually attempt to use juvenile potty humor as a poor substitute for genuine comedy.This tells us volumes about what Hollywood thinks about mainstream America, i.e. about you and I and our sophistication and moral status as viewers. What happened to teams like Monty Python that could make you roll without dropping a single crude word? What happened to great film-writers who didn't feel they had to push the social envelope all the way to the gutter to get a laugh? Do they not know that the best elements of humor are those that are subtle, i.e. those that require the viewer to insert something? The funnies scenes from this film are, as one might expect, the ones that contain none of this. Get a grip, Hollywood! You're out of touch!If you have any self respect, save your money.",Date Night

This is perhaps the WORST WASTE of talent I have ever witnessed in my 57 years. Tina Fey and Steve Carell are amazing masters of dialog and subtlety, yet the writer and director of this movie decided to minimize the dialog and include such things as a ridiculous car chase scene. I am mystified how you could have Tina Fey and Steve Carell on your set and make a bad movie. Before I saw Date Night, I (seriously) would have said that is not possible. Well, it is. Steve Carell and Tina Fey need to make another movie, but they need to write it, and they need a director that is as smart as they are (or at least close). Four thumbs down.",Date Night

230,frazee-tracy,"In the film, ""Date Night"", Phil, played by Steve Carell, and Claire Foster, played by Tina Fey, are bored, working parents.",7,28 March 2011,"Essentially, they are in a rut. Phil decides to take Claire out for a nice date night when they hear that a mutual couple friend is getting divorced. Not wanting to lose their relationship, they decide to have an exciting date night where they go somewhere they have never been before. For the date night Phil and Claire decide to go to a new popular seafood restaurant in New York City called Claw. They do not have reservations and find themselves faced with a very packed place when they arrive. They decide to wait at the bar and after hearing a party's name called multiple times with no response, Phil decides to speak up and claim the table as their own. They enjoy a nice but surely overly expensive meal and at the end they are approached by two men who ask them to silently get up from the table so they do not make a scene. The Foster's assume that the men work for the restaurant and they are going to get reprimanded for taking someone else's reservations. This is where the night takes a turn for the worse! The two men do not work for the restaurant and are actually looking for the couple that the original reservations were for. The men are after a certain item and the Foster's do not have it but these two men are not taking no for an answer! The rest of the film is filled with hilarious moments and action as the Foster's evade the two men throughout the whole evening and into the morning. There are many twists and turns in the plot and was nothing what I expected from the previews. The main theme of this film is teamwork and communication. Throughout the whole film Phil and Claire have to work together to outsmart, outwit and outlast the two crooks that are chasing them. One of the major story lines in the film is how Clair cannot let go enough to trust Phil to make decisions. This whole date night/disaster turns into a learning experience for both of them in how they can work as a couple and a team but still are their own individuals. One scene within the film that really shows how teamwork is essential to the theme is when Claire and Phil are in a car chase and end up getting connected to a cab front bumper to front bumper. There are times when Claire has to let go of her control and give it all over to Phil and vice versa. This is a great example of marriage and teamwork working together. Even in the most extreme times of stress it is nice to know that you can have someone else to lean or ""take the wheel"" for you. Another film that showcases this same type of theme, the husband and wife just going through the motions together and then being thrown into a high stress situation where they have to work together and communicate would be ""True Lies"" from 1994 starring Arnold Schwarzenegger and Jamie Lee Curtis. In this film the plot is a bit different seeing as Schwarzenegger is truly a spy and his wife is thrown in the middle of some drama but the theme itself is still the same. The lighting in Date Night is essential to the film. Obviously, hence the name, the majority of the film occurs in the night. There are many scenes where Phil and Claire are out in the street underneath the street lights or only lit by the moon. These scenes are very important to the film. In Phil and Claire's first meeting with the two men who chase them throughout the film it occurs in the middle of the night in a dark alley. The dark lighting on the ominous characters go together very well and without them the scene itself would not have had the same impact on the viewer. The sound effects that are used in the film add a level of intensity to certain scenes where they are needed. The car chase scene, that was mentioned earlier, had many different sound effects. The sirens of the police cars chasing them, the sound of metal crushing against metal of the two cars stuck together racing down the street. The scene was filmed very well, being able to see the reactions of Phil, Claire and the cab driver during the car chase scene was meaningful and hilarious all at the same time. Regardless of how far two people are in a relationship, there are times when we all need to work together and that is a common trait of relationships and a core value of what is needed to make them work. Phil and Claire might not have been having the most exciting life before their big date night but having the excitement for just one night made them realize that they do work well together and what they have is worth all of the boring nights together eating potato skins and watching movies.",Date Night
