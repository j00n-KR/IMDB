0,MartinHafer,Quite good--especially the first time you see it.,10,5 May 2014,"It's been decades since I've seen ""The Sting"" and I decided to try watching it again. As a result of having seen it a couple times, I have some impressions I might not have had the first time. First, the film is awfully pretty--with some of the nicest titles and intertitle cards I've seen. It also is well-constructed--with several plots being interwoven quite well--a tribute to the director, George Roy Hill. The acting is quite nice and it's interesting that the film won seven Oscars--and none of them for acting! And, just like the first time, the Scott Joplin tunes are terrific. The only real negative is that because I'd seen it before, there were no surprises--and surprises are what makes this such an enjoyable film. Without the surprise, the film lacks something the second time--something that isn't true for all films. ""O Brother, Where Art Thou?"", for example, seems to get better each time you see it--but ""The Sting"" does because the movie is so dependent of surprise plot twists.The bottom line is that for first-time viewers, the film is very hard to beat and it's easy to see how this $5.5 million dollar film brought in over $159,000,000 domestically--making this is mega-mega blockbuster. It's an exceptional film in every way.",The Sting
1,bkoganbing,Working The Big Con,10,5 March 2007,"The Sting, evoking a bygone era of gangsters and con men, was the deserved Best Picture of 1973. The Sting won that Oscar plus a whole flock of technical awards. One award it didn't win was for Robert Redford as Best Actor.That must have been tough for the Academy voters because to single out Redford as opposed to Paul Newman must have felt a bit unjust. For though Newman was nominated many times over his career and finally did win for The Color of Money, did not get a nomination for The Sting.Robert Redford is a small time grifter who while working a bait and switch street con takes off a numbers runner carrying the weekly take. The orders come down from the head man himself, Irish-American gangster Robert Shaw to kill those who did this as an example.Redford's mentor, Robert Earl Jones, is in fact killed, mainly because Redford starts spending a lot of that newly acquired loot that tips them off. Redford wants revenge so he looks up big time con man Paul Newman who himself is dodging law enforcement as is Redford also.They work the big con on Shaw and it's a beauty. The scheme they have is something to behold. They also have to do a couple of improvisations on the fly that lend a few twists to the scheme.The costumes and sets really do evoke Chicago of the Thirties and director George Roy Hill assembles a great cast to support Newman and Redford. My favorite in the whole group is Charles Durning, who plays the brutally corrupt, but essentially dumb cop from Joliet who nearly gums up the works and has to be dealt with.Special mention should also go to Robert Shaw. He's got a difficult part, maybe the most difficult in the film. He's not stupid, he would not have gotten to the top of the rackets if he was. But he also has to show that hint of human weakness that Newman, Redford, and the whole mob they assemble that makes him vulnerable to the con.During the sixties and seventies Robert Shaw was really coming into his own as a player, getting more and more acclaim for his work. His early death was a real tragedy, there was so much more he could have been doing.Can't also forget another co-star in this film, the ragtime music of Scott Joplin that was used to score The Sting. It probably is what most people remember about The Sting. Music from the Theodore Roosevelt era, scoring a film set in the Franklin Roosevelt era made while Nixon was president. Strange, but it actually works.The Sting still works wonders today.",The Sting
2,Leofwine_draca,Lovable roguish classic,9,7 January 2017,"THE STING is a fine 1930s-set comedy adventure film re-teaming Paul Newman and Robert Redford after the runaway success of BUTCH CASSIDY AND THE SUNDANCE KID. I found it more enjoyable than their previous outing thanks to the intense storyline, which is set in the world of gangsters and gambling and features oodles of suspense and tension as the two men attempt to pull off one of the biggest scams in history.The thing that becomes quickly apparent when watching THE STING is just how well written it is. The script is very clever without being obnoxiously so and the involving opening set-piece is a fine example of this. Newman plays in support here and has less screen time than I expected, but the film belongs to Redford anyway and he's a delight, the best I've seen him. The third player in the thing is Robert Shaw, who brings level of quiet intensity to the picture that makes his character even more imposing than the famous henchman role he essayed in FROM Russia WITH LOVE.Although THE STING has a long running time, not a moment of it feels slow or boring. Instead it keeps moving through interesting set-pieces, mainly focused on gambling (which is a fascinating cinematic subject matter in the right hands) but also including a number of decent foot chases too. Everything builds to a classic climax that rounds off an excellent film overall.",The Sting
3,SnoopyStyle,Reunion isn't quite as fun,7,17 November 2013,"Johnny Hooker (Robert Redford) cons a passerby of his cash. The problem is that the passerby was delivering money for a mob boss Doyle Lonnegan (Robert Shaw). Doyle vows to hunt down the petty crocks and kills Hooker's partner. Hooker goes on the run and gets the help of Henry Gondorff (Paul Newman) seeking a long con revenge.The long con can confuse the audience. It takes some effort to follow. Director George Roy Hill doesn't really draw us an easy to follow map. Some of it is great like the card game. As individual scenes, some of them are quite memorable and interesting.If there is one thing missing, it's a bit of comedy to break up the serious tone. Redford-Newman-Hill reunite but is missing that charming fun of 'Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid'. At least it moves along quite well which is not always the case for movies of that era.",The Sting
4,Hitchcoc,It's a Masterpiece of Criminal Sophistication,10,21 December 2016,"For a while, one needs a scorecard to keep track of all the players. As Redford and Neuman light up the screen, we have an incredible intertwining of characters and motivations playing off each other, leading to the final con. What works is that we have a simple motivation that sets it all up. That is the murder of a friend. All else is directed at that central issue. Soon, the masters of the Sting begin to set up the dominoes, They match bad guys against bad guys, create artificial settings, maneuver things in an orchestrated way. Not everything works perfectly. There are some unexpected pitfalls, including a near-fatal mistake, but the beauty is that these villains are almost excited to be separated from their money. One of the really bright spots of the 1970's.",The Sting
5,classicsoncall,"""With no fix, we're gonna need a con with a sure-fire blow-off.""",10,11 March 2012,"I recall back when this movie first came out in 1973 how it was heralded as the second great buddy team-up featuring Newman and Redford. The thing is, they're not really buddies here, they don't even know each other when the picture gets up and running. Yet there's no doubt they have an outstanding chemistry that works it's magic once again following their triumphant pairing in ""Butch Cassidy and The Sundance Kid"".Well this is the con job that out-cons all the rest. The first time you see it, the picture even cons the viewer with the set-up involving Dana Elcar as FBI Agent Polk. You're left gasping in astonishment at the finale as the grifters get gunned down, only to breathe a sigh of relief when Gondorff (Newman) and Johnny (Newman) make with the big reveal. The picture is like that throughout, setting you up with it's twists and turns, misdirecting one's attention at every step, like the hit-man Salino who turns out to be Loretta at the diner instead.The casting for the film was excellent. When you need suave and sophisticated, you get Harold Gould as Kid Twist. Charles Durning is perfect as corrupt cop Snyder, and if you need a glib and street wise fast talker, Ray Walston fits the bill every time. But the film wouldn't have been the same without Robert Shaw as the ruthless mob boss who gets taken out by his own greed. Say, did you notice that Newman used the name Shaw when he posed as the drunk high roller on the train? That was a pretty neat touch.What you'll have to do is watch this film more than once because there's just too much nuance to take it all in on a single viewing. Because the picture involves shady gangsters and scam artists out to make a fast buck, the plot devices can outpace your ability to keep up with it all. Especially that finale when Snyder has to hustle Lonnegan out of the betting parlor when the jig is finally up. Not to worry though, the picture is just as classy and entertaining the second time around. And the third, and the fourth, and.... well, just get yourself stung.",The Sting
6,gavin6942,Newman and Redford: The One-Two Punch,7,5 March 2006,"As I type this, this movie sits at #83 on the all-time greatest movies list. Almost makes me guilty for only giving it a 7 and possibly dropping it to 84, but to be honest it wasn't the greatest movie I've ever seen. But it also wasn't the worst.Paul Newman and Robert Redford are two confidence men (""con men"" or ""grifters"") in the 1930s who cheat at cards. They cheat at cards against a wealthy New York City man and then sucker him in for what is called a ""long con"" or ""big con"". (If you like the character ""Sawyer"" from ""Lost"", this is probably your movie.) The whole second half of the movie is this long con: and will they pull it off? You won't know until the end, because the mafia and the FBI are both trying to kill them. And sometimes happy endings happen when the cops win and the cheaters lose. So don't bet on any horses until you know the score.Anyway, it's a good film. Some parts are hard to follow in my opinion, but in a twisted sense this makes sense -- if they are conning the other cons, surely we the audience should be getting conned, too. It would be shoddy con work to let in ANYBODY, even the audience. And the acting is of course perfect because it's Newman and Redford. But also the guy from My Favorite Martian (Walston) and James Earl Jones' father. So, that's good.They claim the music really makes the film. I disagree. The music is appropriate, but not because it matches the 1940s. Because it matches the cards used to separate the different scenes (which, by the way, I think was a great idea). To cut a review short that isn't going anywhere, this film is recommended. Not highly recommended. Not ""top 100 films of all time"" recommended. But you might want to see it anyway.",The Sting
7,lee_eisenberg,"Good, but in the year that produced ""American Graffiti"", ""The Exorcist"", ""The Last Detail"", ""Serpico"", and ""Enter the Dragon"", did this deserve Best Picture?",7,20 March 2006,"As ""The Sting"" is probably the most famous con artist-themed movie ever, you probably know that it's about aging con artist Henry Gondorff (Paul Newman) and up-and-comer Johnny Hooker (Robert Redford) teaming up to get revenge on crime boss Doyle Lonnegan (Robert Shaw) in Depression-era Chicago.This movie may be most famous as 1973's Best Picture winner, but I wouldn't have given it Best Picture. Granted, it was an interesting look at the underworld of the 1930s and the corruption prevalent throughout that period, but a number of movies that year were more deserving. Oh well. It's still worth seeing. Whenever George Roy Hill directed Newman and Redford together, he always came up with something good. As it was, this was one of two movies in 1973 about Depression-era conning; the other was of course ""Paper Moon"".And ""The Sting II""? I don't think that anyone's actually seen that movie (I sure haven't). Once on ""The Simpsons"", Grampa even made a comment about it's lack of fame.",The Sting
8,jboothmillard,The Sting,9,10 July 2007,"This is the reuniting of the stars of Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid and its director Oscar winning George Roy Hill, and it is a very triumphant, and in my opinion better film. It is the 1930's, and Johnny Hooker (Oscar nominated Robert Redford) is the young conman being taught by Luther Coleman (Robert Earl Jones, father of James, aka Darth Vader's voice). One day they get netted into a con job, and what they don't know is the man they conned is the courier for a numbers runner. The boss Doyle Lonnegan (Robert Shaw) turns out to considers this an attack on him and orders termination of all involved. Hooker is shaken by crooked cop Lt. Wm. Snyder (The Muppet Movie's Charles Durning) and says unless he pays him off he will turn him over. He pays him and tries to warn Luther, but it is too late. He then goes to great conman Henry Gondorff (Paul Newman) who had some bad luck. Luther hears what happened, and sees Hooker hungry for payback, so he assembles a gang and decides to con Lonnegan. The story really picks up (it was slow for a while) when Henry cheats in the poker game, and Lonnegan has to rely on phone calls from an unknown man Henry knows to get the money he owes. These phone calls tell him to bet on certain horses with a high chance of winning. This plan seems to go well, and it concludes with the final bet where Lonnegan makes a mistake, and Henry and Hooker are killed, before Lonnegan leaves. But the entire room was set-up with people acting, and Henry and Hooker made it look like they had died, the biggest and best con, or 'The Sting', resulting in getting $500,000. Also starring Ray Walston as J.J. Singleton, Eileen Brennan as Billie, Patch Adams' Harold Gould as Kid Twist, John Heffernan as Eddie Niles, Dana Elcar as F.B.I. Agent Polk, Jack Kehoe as Erie Kid and Dimitra Arliss as Loretta. A fantastic period (gangster) crime caper, with some great cons, great chases, and great actors. It won the Oscars for Best Art Direction-Set Decoration, Best Costume Design, Best Film Editing, Best Music for Marvin Hamlisch, Best Writing, Story and Screenplay Based on Factual Material or Material Not Previously Published or Produced and Best Picture, and it was nominated for Best Cinematography and Best Sound, and it was nominated the Golden Globe for Best Screenplay. Robert Redford was number 61, and Paul Newman number 16 on The 100 Greatest Movie Stars, and the film was number 45 on The Ultimate Film. Very good!",The Sting
9,rmax304823,"Fun With Hooker, Harry, and Suitcase Sammy.",7,31 August 2008,"It's an enjoyable story of two men -- Paul Newman and Robert Redford -- who organize a long con in order to bilk a big gangster, Robert Shaw, out of half a million dollars in 1920s Chicago. The set up is very complicated and there are a thousand points at which the elaborate scheme could fall apart. But the writers and producers had just knocked off the lovable Newman/Redford pairing in ""Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid,"" so ""this time they might get away with it,"" as the ad slogan put it. PS.: they do.They're helped by a cast of seasoned professionals, all of whom look their parts -- Ray Walston, Charles Durning, Eileen Brennan, Jack Kehoe, Harold Gould, Dimitra Arliss. The plot is labyrinthine and sometimes keeps not just the mark in the dark but the audience as well. Surprises come thick and fast and often are amusing as well as shocking. And there are some very funny moments indeed. A Western Union agent is made to evacuate his office by two men posing as painters and returns a few minutes later to find it empty, the walls half painted a bilious green, tarps draped over the furniture, everything abandoned in mid-job.In fact, manipulative as the scenario is, there are some neat scenes. Redford has made the acquaintance of a rather plain-looking, fustian waitress, Loretta. The night before the big showdown, he's nervous and knocks on her door. He asks if she would like to go out somewhere, perhaps for a drink, and there follows this exchange.Loretta: I don't even know you.Redford: You know me. It's two o'clock in the morning and I don't know nobody.That's not bad writing.Newman and Redford lead the cast and they're pretty good at what they do. Marvin Hamlisch adapted the flexible, rag time score from Scott Joplin. Though it draws from an earlier historical period it sounds most apt.Lots of fun. It was followed by a sequel which I haven't bothered to see.",The Sting
10,Tweekums,One of the great caper movies,10,29 May 2017,"It is the 1930s and Johnny Hooker and his friend Luther Coleman are a pair of conmen running short cons in Joliet, Illinois until one day they target the wrong man. They think they were lucky to get away with several thousand dollars but it is mob money and mob boss Doyle Lonnegan wants to make an example of anybody who crosses his organisation. Soon Coleman is dead and it looks like Hooker will be next. Hooker isn't intending to run though; he wants to get revenge for his friend's death. To this end he teams up with Henry Gondorff, a specialist in the long con. Lonnegan won't be an easy mark though; his only known weakness is his enjoyment of high stakes poker but as he cheats he won't be easy to beat. The poker will just be the hook; to really hurt him they must persuade him to place a very large bet where he thinks he is the one cheating and when it is over he mustn't know that he has been conned it might not be easy but it will be worth it.This film is rightfully considered a classic and for numerous reasons. Robert Redford and Paul Newman are on top form as Hooker and Gondorff and Roberts Shaw impresses as the villainous Lonnegan; the rest of the cast were good too. The film nicely captures the feel of '30s Chigago, or at least how it looks in films of that era. Of course this would mean little without a good story and this has a great one; the 'good guys' may be criminals but they are likable and the 'bad guy' is clearly far worse; there are also some really good twists. These twists are neither too obvious nor are they too far-fetched. There is some action, some a bit surprising for a PG rated film. Also surprising for a PG is the use of some racist language; probably less than would have been expected in the '30s but still a bit surprising in 2017 it doesn't detract from this great film but some patents might be uncomfortable with showing it to children. Overall a really good film that all film viewers should check out at least once.",The Sting
11,ma-cortes,Sensational picture with the greatest stars and winning deservedly several Oscars,7,13 August 2012,"In 1930s Chicago, a young con man (Robert Redford's character , Johnny Hooker, is supposedly named after blues legend John Lee Hooker) seeking vendetta for his murdered partner teams up with a master of the big con (Paul Newman) to win a fortune from a criminal mobster (Robert Shaw).Enjoyable picture with magnificent performances, splendid period piece , thrills , humor , plot twists , emotion and amusement . The movie is based on the real-life exploits of grifter brothers Charley and Fred Gondorf, whose experiences culminated in a scam similar to the one shown in the film, known in 1914 as ""the wire"" or ""the big store"". Unlike the movie, however, the actual ""mark"" was more than happy to testify against Charley Gondorf, the front man of the scam, and he spent time in Sing Sing, as did his younger brother a year later for running another scam , both served a few years and were released . Producer David S. Ward got the idea for this movie when he was working on the script for Steelyard Blues, which includes a pickpocketing scene , researching this, Ward found himself reading about con artists ; Ward had shown the other screenplay to Tony Bill, so he now gave him an outline of this story. Likable acting from Robert Redford , Jack Nicholson and Warren Beatty turned down the role of Johnny Hooker before Robert Redford changed his mind and decided to play it . Exceptional Paul Newman as an expert swindler. Robert Shaw was injured his knee and incorporated the resulting limp into his performance , as he steals the show as a nasty mobster , though Richard Boone was the first choice for the role of Lonnegan , Oliver Reed was offered the role but refused to test for it , he would later play Lonnegan in the sequel . Support cast is frankly excellent such as Charles Durning as Lt. Wm. Snyder , Ray Walston as J.J. Singleton , Eileen Brennan as Billie , Harold Gould as Kid Twist , Charles Dierkop as Floyd and Dana Elcar as FBI agent . Evocative set decoration by Henry Bumstead who usually worked with Alfred Hitchcock . Colorful and glimmer cinematography by Robert Surtees , usual cameraman expert on super-productions . Director George Roy Hill wanted to film the picture on location, but Henry Bumstead was adamant that it would be much too hard to get the period appearance right; for example, things like lane markings on the streets ; in the end, the only location shooting was a few days' worth in Chicago and Los Angeles; most of the exteriors were filmed on Universal's back lot . Wonderful score consists of Scott Joplin ragtime compositions well played by recently deceased Marvin Hamlisch , which were composed between 1900 and 1910 , although The Sting helped bring Joplin's ragtime back into American popular culture, they actually predate the period of the story by 25 years. Marvelous gowns by Edith Head who won her 8th and final Best Costume Design Academy Award for this film .Followed by an inferior sequel , ¨The sting 2¨ (1983) by Jeremy Kagan , also produced by David S Ward with Jackie Gleason , Karl Malden , Mac Davis, Teri Garr and Oliver Reed was offered the original role but refused to test for it he would later play Lonnegan in this following. Rating : sublime film , two thumbs up , essential and indispensable seeing .",The Sting
12,moonspinner55,Old-fashioned and polished...but with an artificial look and a draggy midsection,6,14 October 2007,"In 1936 Chicago, a con-artist and a cocky grifter team up to '86' the slimy racketeer who killed the grifter's best friend. Handsome production, fun ragtime music score (courtesy of Oscar-winner Marvin Hamlisch, via Scott Joplin) and lots of star-wattage from a first-rate cast helped make ""The Sting"" hugely popular in 1973, leading to seven Academy Award wins including Best Picture. It's an astute, polished movie made with panache, yet the story isn't mounted with much excitement, stretching a fairly standard revenge plot an awfully long way. There's too much talk and story exposition for the film to juggle successfully, and the middle section bogs down. The now-famous finale is pulled off with high good humor, though the set here is an eyesore (most of the picture is filmed in ugly browns and reds, though cinematographer Robert Surtees did receive an Oscar nod for his work). Good performances by Paul Newman and Robert Redford in the leads, a terrific one by Robert Shaw as their nemesis. Director George Roy Hill won the Best Director Oscar; David S. Ward won for his screenplay. Ward later went on to write a sequel, ""The Sting II"", in 1983, with Jackie Gleason and Mac Davis starring. **1/2 from ****",The Sting
13,blanche-2,often imitated - never equaled,10,15 August 2006,"I saw ""The Sting"" tonight for the first time in many years - I saw it several times in the theater when it opened in 1973. Great cast, perfect direction, fantastic script, excellent period setting, brilliant soundtrack - it's hard to ask for more.Seeing it again brought back so many memories, especially seeing young Robert Redford, who was THE matinée idol back then, and the Scott Joplin pieces could be heard everywhere you went.The plot is full of twists and turns - it has humor, sadness, and depth - something you don't run across as much nowadays. For those seeing it the first time, the surprises are many.Redford carries the film, as his is the bigger and more developed role. It's a relaxed performance with a lot of heart. Newman's role is smaller - his scenes with Robert Shaw during the card game are priceless, from his drunk act, mispronouncing Lonnegan's name, laughing and rubbing his hands when he wins, and blowing his nose on his tie - he's just great. Shaw is frightening as Lonnegan with his quiet, barely controlled anger dying to erupt and the determined look on his face.Newman and Redford are one of the great screen teams - it's a pity they didn't do more together, but they gave us two classics. It'll have to be good enough - just like the sting to take down Doyle Lonnegan in one of the great American films.",The Sting
14,Quinoa1984,"great cast, some fun scenes, shallow as all hell",7,7 May 2015,"The Sting is a Hollywood diversion that is slickly made, acted even better, and has an ending that is one of those that people seem to love to pieces but I kind of have a problem with, but I'll get to that later. What George Roy Hill and David S. Ward do get right is that thrill and rush of pulling off a nice solid con on someone, which we see right away in the film from Robert Redford's character Hooker, and his partner in crime Luther Coleman (Robert Earl Jones, good for how little he's used). The premise is straight-forward enough: the money that the two con away is really dough that belongs to a gangster, the scary, steel-eyed Lonegan (Robert Shaw), and when Luther is taken out by his men, Hooker wants revenge. Enter in expert-con/Grifter Master Gondorff (Paul Newman), and instead of simple blood and bullets, there is a much different thing to do to get back: the ""Long Con"" - all the money they can squeeze out of the guy.Just because it's in the 1970's, you should know, it's not really all THAT dark like a lot of other movies of its ilk. And that's fine; Hill knows what his movie is, and goes even further: wipes and transitions are meant to call back to, I suppose, old-time movie clichés, and the Marvin Hamlisch music is so kitschy it'll make 'Raindrops Keep Falling on My Head' in Butch/Sundance gritty by comparison. Perhaps one should also know that it's self-conscious about itself, and later movies like Soderbergh's Ocean's Eleven would emulate how the characters - and by proxy, the audience - are all in on the joke (except for the flustered villain).While Shaw here may be a much better target - more of the kind of threat that can chill the bones and is impossible to look away from - than the later Andy Garcia example, I'm not sure if all of the film really *sticks* with me. It's all a crowd-pleaser, to be sure, and Hill knows that he has two gigantic stars. Oddly enough, Redford got an Oscar nomination for the character, and he's not bad... but it's the kind of character that isn't really that hard to play, and even during his cons (much like performances) he's more convincing in the voice. Newman fares much better for me, and my favorite scene in the film is with him as he does the first part of the Long Con against Lonegan, a poker game on a train where he acts like a louse, drinks like a fish, and gets under his skin. This is one of those riveting 'Movie' scenes (with a capital M) that makes the experience worthwhile.Things get a little muddier for me in the third act, but what got to me by the end was how the filmmakers got, frankly, manipulative. Much of the film is handsomely mounted and easy to take, the stakes are solidly made and the third act even tries to make things more dramatic and interesting. But, suffice it to say, this is *not* Butch and Sundance. Maybe I let myself get ""conned"" as well, so to speak, with the twist that the FBI are not exactly who they appear to be, and everything is honky-dory by the end. But it didn't really seem that... necessary, as in to make the impression on the Mark that was intended. Ultimately, it makes the experience feel even hollower than before. Where Butch & Sundance had much more harrowing things going on, this is much more pleasant.Bottom line, The Sting is a fun experience, but just up to a point, elevated mostly by its cast (Shaw is really terrific here, even down to his character's limp, which is wisely not explained, but the audience can infer how it happened in the life of crime), and a few very funny scene. Hell, it's the kind of movie with people getting shot here and there that you can show to your grandmother. It's just the kind of thing that the Academy certainly ate up with a big giant spoon, and gave it seven Oscars including best picture (and more power to Julia Phillips as the first woman picture winner). But... there's the air of BS to that ending that I just can't shake off. It's a good movie, and yet I can't shake the sensation it could've been more. 7.5/10",The Sting
15,edwagreen,The Sting is A Stinger (Stinker) **1/2,4,28 August 2010,"The roster of best picture nominees for 1973 must have been very weak for Elizabeth Taylor to have opened the envelope and announced ""The Sting"" as the winner of the coveted best picture of the year. Equally ridiculous was the nomination of Robert Redford for his good looks as best actor. At least, he didn't win, but neither did Al Pacino for ""Serpico.""Eileen Brennan was given little to do here and the contrived plot deals with con artists and plenty of twists and turns in-between.Robert Shaw steals the film as the main heavy who Redford and Paul Newman take on for killing their friend.

While Mr. Redford wastes his money gambling, his partner decides to use his share of the $11,000 to retire. Sadly, Luther is killed for the con. Redford takes the dead man's advice and looks up Chicago con-man Paul Newman (as Henry Gondorff). Mr. Newman, a bit down-on-his-luck, sobers up quickly. Then, the handsome duo plot an elaborate revenge, setting up ""The Sting"" on gangster Robert Shaw (as Doyle Lonnegan).This film is too contrived, too calculated, and too cool. Suffice to say George Roy Hill very successfully directs box office stars Paul Newman and Robert Redford, as he did in ""Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid"" (1969). It's interesting to see Newman in a role secondary to Redford - yet, it never really seems that way, and the stars elevate each other more than even their first pairing, which was a better film. This time, they play on their collaborative appeal. David S. Ward's story, the marvelous supporting cast, Marvin Hamlisch's tinkling Scott Joplin score, and the pseudo thirties look add up to style.******** The Sting (12/25/73) George Roy Hill ~ Robert Redford, Paul Newman, Robert Shaw, Eileen Brennan",The Sting
17,sunwarrior13,The Sting And The Entertainer Makes It A Classic,10,30 October 2011,"Four years after setting box office hit in Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid,Paul Newman,Robert Redford, and director George Roy Hill re-teamed with similar success for movie entitled,The Sting - one of the best films that I have ever seen in my life. The Sting is a caper film set in September 1936 that involves a complicated plot by two professional grifters to con a mob boss.It stars Newman and Redford together with Robert Shaw and Charles Durning.It was created by screenwriter David S. Ward based on the story that was inspired by real-life con games perpetrated by the brothers Fred and Charley Gondorff and documented by David Maurer in his book The Big Con: The Story of the Confidence Man. It was directed by Hill.The movie has Redford playing a Depression-era confidence trickster Johnny Hooker, whose friend and mentor Luther Coleman is murdered by a henchman of racketeer/gambler Doyle Lonnegan. Hoping to avenge Luther's death,Johnny begins planning a ""sting"" -- an elaborate scam -- to destroy Lonnegan. He enlists the aid of ""the greatest con artist of them all,"" Henry Gondorff, who pulls himself out of a drunken stupor and rises to the occasion. Hooker and Gondorff gather together an impressive array of con men, all of whom despise Lonnegan and wish to settle accounts on behalf of Luther. The twists and surprises that follow are too complex to relate in detail -- suffice to say that you can't cheat an honest man, and that you shouldn't accept everything at face value. Added to that,it has a conclusion that will surprise each and every viewer.The Sting is proves that charm, humor, and a few surprising twists and ending can add up to a great film.This Depression-era comedy cashes in on the individual charm of Newman and Redford and the strong chemistry between them.Also,it has extremely handsome production values and a great supporting cast like Shaw and Durning that provide an excellent and outstanding film. And of course,who can forget music score that contained the selections most of which are Scott Joplin ragtime pieces like ""The Entertainer"" makes it really an unforgettable piece of cinema.This film is highly recommended for people who loves great films for The Sting is a classic.",The Sting

I have seen it written that the film's success was only garnered because of the star appeal of the leads! Well for starters that is an insult to Robert Shaw who may be accused of overdoing it at times, but his portrayal of Lonnegan is a complete joy, witness the fury on his face during an on train poker game as the irrepressible Newman does comedy gold. Visually the film is a delight, and the story fuses together to culminate in an ending that not only stings with impact; but also floats like a cinematic butterfly. 10/10",The Sting
20,Theo Robertson,Entertaining,7,20 March 2003,"THE STING can`t be described as a masterwork of cinema but that`s not really its intention . It`s sole agenda is to entertain and it succeeds . Director George Roy Hill brings a heavily stylised almost comic book form to the movie . Scott Joplin ragtime score is extremely memorable but the best aspect to the film is the cast , Newman , Redford and Shaw make a good team and it`s sad they didn`t make more films together . Please Mr Hollywood Producer do NOT do a remake with George Clooney and Brad Pitt . David S Ward`s script is good but it`s not flawless since it contains one subplot too many ( The subplot about Doyle Lonnegan hiring a top hitman ) which is basically unnecessary and disposable.All in all a very entertaining film",The Sting
21,Doylenf,The clever plot makes multiple viewings mandatory for full enjoyment...,9,14 May 2005,"THE STING is so full of twists and turns at every unexpected moment that it never stops drawing you into all of its traps. All of it is performed at a fast clip and the performances have all the nuances needed to keep you entertained and in suspense.Sparked by perfect period detail, a Scott Joplin piano score courtesy of Marvin Hamlisch and grand performances, it is gritty and at all times entertaining--it deserves to be seen more than once to relish all the tricks you missed the first time.For full enjoyment, a plot description is better left for the first time viewer to discover so I won't give any plot details here.The three central performances are perfection--Robert Redford, so comfortable in a role he was obviously born to play, Paul Newman, the epitome of a confidence trickster and Robert Shaw as the man who falls hard for The Sting. Newman and Redford are even more at home here than they were as Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid.No wonder it won so many '73 Oscars--including Best Picture. A film to relish again and again, with scenes that never lose their punch. The story is full of clever touches that will hook you into the 1930s atmosphere and have you waiting for the knockout ending.Watch for the scene of Redford and the waitress he seeks out at 2:00 a.m. It's the kind of acting that can melt your heart.",The Sting
22,preppy-3,Hated it,1,14 April 2004,"Dull, boring movie of two con men (Robert Redford and Paul Newman) going up against a gangster that killed one of their best friends.Aside from the great Ragtime music and the costumes there's nothing even remotely good about this.  I was basically bored stiff by it.  The plot was predictable and the movie moved at a snails pace.  The comedy wasn't funny, the dialogue seemed forced and the ""twist"" in the plot was laughably obvious.  Even Newman, Redford and Robert Shaw (all good actors) looked thoroughly bored during the movie.  I've never seen Newman so lifeless!But, as some previous posters have said, maybe this was considered fresh and new back in 1973.  That could be...but it certainly doesn't age well!  The best movies hold up no matter how old they are...this doesn't.  How it's in the top 100 here is beyond me.  I really can't recommend this at all.",The Sting
23,LeonLouisRicci,Inoffensive and Charming,7,2 April 2013,"When Film Fanatics, Critics, and Movie lovers discuss the great Directors, the name George Roy Hill is hardly ever mentioned. Even though he did make two of the most successful and popular Movies ever, Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid and this overrated Blockbuster.This is not an oversight. It is an insight. While those two mega-hits are above average and entertaining, they hardly can be regarded as groundbreaking Art or Cinema Masterpieces. Artistic achievement and popularity, at times, can be completely out of sync.This is an attractively flat looking, vaguely interesting, audience friendly Movie with high production values and is delivered by Professional Craftsmen, but it is rather unremarkable and has an inoffensive charm that was an against the grain of late 60's and early 70's trend of gritty realism that must have been a breath of fresh air for audiences and Academy voters that were enamored by its sweetness.Nothing here is a turnoff but it is hardly much of a turn on. It remains what it was. Not much more than an entertaining fluff piece with handsome Movie Stars and a slightly engaging story. Kind of a throwback to an era when life was less complicated or it seemed that way at the Movies. It was the Silent Majority that made this a Hit. The Counter Culture was less impressed and in retrospect, they were right.",The Sting
24,CinemaSerf,"""I don't know enough about killing to kill...""",8,17 January 2021,"Aside from perhaps in ""Jaws"" (1975), this features my standout performance from Robert Shaw as ""Lonnegan"" who is set up perfectly by Robert Redford (""Hooker"") and Paul Newman (""Gondorff"") in the con to end all cons. Scott Joplin's magnificent ""Pineapple Rag"" starts us off on this vastly superior criminal caper that is full of wit and wisdom - plenty of peril, seat-of-your pants jeopardy and three outstanding performances that see our two young hustlers put together a scam that ensnares the worldly, crooked, mobster Irishman. It's the depth to the story that makes this different - the three lead characters have ample opportunity to drag us into their underworld, and they do it well - we find ourselves (willingly) embroiled in their cunning wheeze just as surely as their army of cohorts who do everything needed to create the framework for this perfect crime. Eileen Brennan and Charles Durning help keep the screws turning as they bait and hook their quarry, and the pace and stylish direction from Hill keep us all on tenterhooks right to the death... I fear that this must be due for a ""re-imagining"", but I truly hope any such ambitions are thwarted by just watching this and appreciating it's humour and subtlety - and concluding that it isn't broke - so don't try to fix it!",The Sting

I have already covered his breakout role as Rocky Graziano in Somebody Up There Likes Me, which was screened at the National Film Theatre, after which I came home and played the DVD of The Sting. Both films benefited from outstanding supporting roles though Somebody lacked a co-star of the stature of Robert Redford, and The Sting was replete with the likes of Ray Walston, Eileen Brennan, Robert Shaw - who, to be fair, shared equal billing with Redford and Newman - Harold Gould etc. The sure-footed screenplay by David S.

Maybe it's just me but the jaw line, the mouth, and the eyes--they are eerily alike. Because of that I kept seeing the two main characters, Robert Redford and Paul Newman, as a 1973 Brad Pitt and George Clooney.The comparison totally fits. Newman and Clooney don't look that much alike but they were both the older of the couple, salt and pepper hair, the brains of the operation. Redford and Pitt look just alike, the younger of the couple, almost like the apprentice. Both tandems going for a major score, employed multiple players, and took several days to set up. If you haven't guessed by now I'm comparing The Sting to Ocean's Eleven (the Clooney/Pitt version).The Sting was very clever, suspenseful in a light way, and a movie that keeps you engaged because you don't want to miss an important detail.

And, although Redford get's the lion's share of the on-screen business, the magic does work once more in this enormously entertaining period piece.The plot is nearly as complicated as the main scam, the performances, script, music and period feel are all superb, and the film is exciting, funny and endlessly entertaining.

Well, I finally did see it, and I was expecting something more than I got, which was a diverting but unremarkable heist comedy.I can see why this movie made such an impact at the time. It re-teams Paul Newman and Robert Redford, who had made such a hit a few years earlier with ""Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid."" It came out during a fertile period for wonderful but admittedly grim and depressing films, so it probably drifted through movie theatres like a fresh breeze.

The settings look fake, the actors look bored, and the story has numerous flaws, and is predictable to boot. I mean, what happened to Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid? Paul Newmann and Robert Redford made such a great pair in Hill's earlier film. They barely even talk to each other in The Sting. Every bit of characterization to be found in the film is in Redford, but he's wrong for the role. And how could someone waste Charles Durning so egregiously? Perhaps the only bit of greatness in the film is in the score, adapted from Scott Joplin's music - or at least it would be great if it added any mood or depth to the film. I certainly didn't hate this movie, but, like I said, it's the height of mediocrity. 6/10.",The Sting

The Sting is a classic that never shows its age.  It was the first movie I ever saw, at age 4, when the family went to the Drive-In.  This movie could pass being made last year.  A script with twist, bends, and dives; with characters you love and ones you hate.  Acting that is believable,and historically accurate. The best performance of Robert Shaw's career, he outshone Redford and Newman.  This film is exceptional, and one of a few movies ABC showed for around 13 years after its release.",The Sting
34,SimonJack,"Entertaining, but not as good after the first viewing",7,13 June 2015,"After watching this film again recently, I don't think it's as good as it must have seemed to me when I first saw it in the theater many years ago. I still think it's very entertaining and fun. The movie is billed as a comedy, crime and drama. But beyond the idea for the plot, and our seeing it carried out, there isn't anything spectacular about ""The Sting."" I give it seven stars, but it is far from ever making a list of my favorite 250 films. The movie has a considerable cast of familiar names of the day. Some have endearing roles in the film. Only two performances stand out as above average – Paul Newman as Henry Gondorff, and Robert Shaw as Doyle Lonnegan. Newman didn't get an Academy Award nomination, but Robert Redford did for his role of Johnny Hooker. I give a clear nod to Newman for the versatility of his role, and his carrying it off quite well. He was serious at times, light-hearted at others, and switched to the raucous, loud and unafraid drunken card player – purposely taunting Shaw's Lonnegan. That was a good piece of acting. The cast were all quite good, the costumes and other technical aspects were good. Those are the things that earned ""The Sting"" most of its seven Oscars. And, they were probably deserved awards. The fact that this film won the best picture Oscar indicates that the competition wasn't that great for 1973. There were a few very good films and after that, only mediocre stuff. Still, I can't see how this film won out over ""The Exorcist."" On the other hand, I think George Roy Hill was deserving of the Oscar for directing ""The Sting."" It would be a toss-up between him and William Friedkin for ""The Exorcist.""The voters in Hollywood must have been in a light or romantic mood that year. The acting Oscars (save for Jack Lemmon's best actor in ""Save the Tiger"") went to actors in light, comedy romances and dramas. A couple of outstanding performances were passed over by actors in ""The Exorcist.""The script for ""The Sting,"" was good, but not very witty or funny. The dialog between Hooker and Gondorff when they first meet, is the only really funny scene. Hooker, ""Luther said I could learn something from you. I already know how to drink."" Gondorff, later, ""Are you going to stay for breakfast, or do you already know how to eat?"" Hooker, ""Can you get a mob together?"" Gondorff, ""With what happened to Luther, I don't think I can get more than two-, three hundred guys.""",The Sting

36,JamesHitchcock,The Moral Order Restored,9,15 March 2004,"Johnny Hooker and Luther Coleman are `grifters' or confidence tricksters in 1930s Chicago. Unknown to them, however, one of their victims works for a vicious local gangster named Doyle Lonnegan, and when Lonnegan finds out what has happened he has Luther murdered. Hooker is not a violent man by nature and admits that he does not know much about killing, but nevertheless wishes to take revenge for his partner's death. He decides that the best way is to hurt Lonnegan's pride by relieving him of some of his wealth. He joins forces with another con man named Henry Gondorff, and together they come up with an elaborate plan, not only to cheat Lonnegan, but also to do it in such a way that he never realises that he has been cheated. The plot unfolds with great ingenuity; until the final denouement the audience are never quite sure which developments are for real and which are part of the elaborate scheme.Crime thrillers set during this period are normally associated with the classic `film noir' style, with its dark, brooding, cynical atmosphere. In `The Sting', however, George Roy Hill deliberately sets out to create a very different mood. The style is almost the exact opposite of film noir. The acting is heavily stylised (as is the scenery), and the division of the film into sections with titles such as `The Hook' or `The Line' is reminiscent of the formal division of a stage play into acts and scenes. The film is not in black-and-white but in bright colour, and the mood, far from being heavy and brooding, is light and cheerful. Scott Joplin's music, although written slightly earlier than the period in which the film is set, fits this mood perfectly. The major actors all play their parts perfectly- Robert Shaw as the glowering, menacing Lonnegan, Robert Redford as the young, idealistic Hooker (insofar as a con-man can be said to be an idealist), and Paul Newman as the older, more experienced and laid-back Gondorff. There are also good contributions from Charles Durning as the corrupt policement Lieutenant Snyder and Robert Earl Jones as Luther.Despite the cheerful mood, the film has serious undertones in keeping with its themes of revenge and murder. I am not usually a great admirer of what are known as `heist' or `caper' movies, as I feel that too often they glamourise crime and dishonesty. `The Sting', however, is different. Hooker and Gondorff live in a world where the moral order has broken down. The police are hopelessly corrupt- Snyder, the one representative we see of the forces of law and order, is on Lonnegan's payroll. There is no chance of Hooker getting justice for his friend's murder through the normal channels; the only way in which this can be achieved is to go outside the law. Where the police are crooked, only the criminals can execute justice. The emotional satisfaction we feel at the end of the film is because a sort of moral order has finally been restored and, moreover, because this has been done without anyone getting injured except Lonnegan's wallet. An excellent film, which well deserved its Academy Award. 9/10.",The Sting

The Sting is a perfect example of this. It has a great cast & tells a great story, actually several great stories within the film. You can feel the positive attitude the filmmaker had when you watch the film.It sets up well in the depression era mid-west. You can feel the film twisting & Turning from the beginning when Luther (Robert Earl Coleman)& Hooker (Redford) mistakenly scam a big time bookies payoff runner. From there, you see revenge & then one con after another leading up to a fantastic finale.The cast is so rich with Redford, Newman(Henry Gondorf), Shaw (Donnegan), Ray Walston(JJ) , Harold Gould, Charles Durning, Eileen Brennan, & others, that it is amazing that the story has enough twists that no one actor dominates the film entirely. That is what makes the film so strong, along with the great ragtime music soundtrack. I first saw this on a date, & the film was so good, that unlike Seinfeld at Shindlers List, we didn't make out until after the movie. The first viewing is the best, but it is good enough that once in a while a revisit to it is worthwhile. The story is so well done, that you don't forget it once you have seen it.While this film twists the viewer, it tells a great story in the same detached way our media views reality- through it's own eyes.

39,lasttimeisaw,The Sting,8,8 November 2012,"THE STING is another Redford-Newman collaboration with director George Roy Hill after BUTCH CASSIDY AND THE SUNDANCE KID (1969, 9/10), and this time it reaped more than what it sowed, 7 Oscar winnings including BEST PICTURE and BEST DIRECTOR. No need to say the film is intriguingly diverting, the rectitude and benevolence of grifters are bonded together with friendship, craftsmanship and camaraderie, by contrast, the police forces (including the FBI) and the greedy and shifty bankers come under the lash, and being bamboozled, which, is pertinent to strike a chord with general audience into a world of escapism and fairness. To my surprise, the first-billed Newman has a lesser screen-time than his co-leader Redford, but his personal allure could never be underestimated, the charm is oozing from every single glance and gesture, while Redford has ample time to play his reckless but fleet-footed character to a maximum closeness with the audience (it has been his only Oscar acting nomination so far), despite of being too handsome, his larger-than-life optimism has found the right niche in the film. The supporting group is crammed with typecast roles (a crippled villain and his minions, a corrupted cop, a bunch of fellow grifters, pi-faced assassins), Robert Shaw and Eileen Brennan are superbly cast, the latter's iron-face yet kind-hearted procuress is very much underwritten. The score from Marvin Hamlisch is legendarily well-known, whenever co-occurring with the segment captions or transiting the tonal settings, it is smoothly catchy, like the film itself, establish itself as the paradigm of what Hollywood and motion pictures could concoct with the best brains and the technology staff, even the final twist is not that unexpected, nevertheless an anticlimax will never play out to kill off the satisfactory mood after steeping into a great piece of work",The Sting

41,ElMaruecan82,A Cinematic Delight ...,10,31 May 2011,"The Reviewer : ElMaruecan82 ~~~~~~~~~The Entrance : ~~~~~~~~~The piano bar starts playing the first iconic notes  like so many musical breezes whispering a cool and mysterious detachment ... and progressively, inviting itself in my pleasure, the melody draws a big smile in my face I quietly smile, letting myself absorbed by this nostalgic music rocking me comfortably  as if I could let this cinematic jewel sleep in my memory for a few seconds ... that would feel like an eternity ... Then suddenly, the rhythm gets faster and more joyful well, it couldn't have had a more fitting name, it's 'The Entertainer', the unforgettable Scott Joplin's piano theme, embodying the 30's as a period I never lived, but strongly feel as if I did  a music resurrected by the magic of a film to become immortal. One of the greatest cinematic scores for a classic among the classics: George Roy Hill's ""The Sting"".The Point : ~~~~~~~ You all know what it's about, two con men who set up one of the most elaborated schemes in order to avenge a mutual friend. The man to be conned is a ruthless gangster boss whose position can't allow him to be made to look ridiculous. And the con is the kind that you either make it or break it, at the key : half-million of dollars, with no second chance. You expect something clever, ingenuous, big and spectacular and believe me, you'll get it. The plot is so intricate, so brilliantly complicated that you don't necessarily get it the first time, but one thing for sure, you're eager to watch it again. The enjoyment of the film works on a peripheral level thanks to the music, the characters, the dialogs and of course the ending, so many encouraging elements for multiple viewings ... to let the film grow on you  this is the fate of great classics.The Touch : ~~~~~~~And ""The Sting"" is one of these classics that plunge you in a universe that only belongs to them, the period setting, the characterization, the witty dialogs, the jazz, the style, the movie exudes a delightful uniqueness that has stood the test of time after almost 40 years. My comparison will surprise some fellow movie fans, but I think there's something oddly resembling between ""The Sting"" and another praised masterpiece: ""City Lights"". The two movies were deliberately dated in the style they opted for, but the audacious artistic touch revealed itself to work as an antidote against aging, the movie doesn't look 'thirties', nor 'seventies', it's just classic and modern in a splendid dosage. And this is what movies are about, creating endearing sensations that live forever  ""The Sting"" has this 'Universal' appeal (no pun intended) thanks to a little something that makes it very charming on the surface, probably the fact that it's constructed as a stage The Fun : ~~~~~~We do have the feeling that the actors are playing, I don't mean acting, but playing in the real sense of the word, the one that tickles our inner child. They are adult men who play, lie, have fun, take risk and even ""The Sting"" is played for real, everything is staged, even the opening credits are original as they present the actors as the protagonists of a vast farce which will take us, viewers, as accomplices. We follow a wonderful gallery of colorful characters such as Johnny Hooker, Henry Gondorf, Twist Kid, the Erie Kid and many others, into a fantastic exploration of the world of grifters. Robert Redford and Paul Newman who paired in ""Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid"" form a wonderful duo, with a priceless interaction between the apprentice and the mentor. Indeed, the kind of con they're going to pull is a whole artistic accomplishment with a quite pedagogic value, illustrated by all the chapters that structure the film like so many necessary steps to make the perfect sting. In fact, we're like children who admire men with a unique ability to fool their neighbor, and it looks so natural we almost envy this talent. And I think I know why  The Text : ~~~~~~~The reason is, in my opinion, the script, it's complex and intelligent. It's intelligent in the literal meaning of the world as we really understand what it's about, and intelligent, as it honors men of intelligence. This is the appeal of ""The Sting"". Beyond the setting, the characters, the music, there's the pleasure of admiring how fooling someone can be an art that requires a perfect timing, many psychological talents, and I'm saying art and not science, because of the human factor. Of course, the movie's general mood is positive and cheerful as we forget these guys are 'criminal', but like the other movie that won the Best Picture Oscar one year before, it's 'good criminals vs. bad criminals'. It works despite Robert Shaw's sweet ability to portray Doyle Lonnegan and inspire us empathy, except in the beginning where he sentenced two men to death, without even knowing them. Apart from that, he's a poor man being fooled. Or maybe the empathetic process just works because we're also fooled by the story at one point? The Review: ~~~~~~~These questions don't really matter when the essential is elsewhere  ""The Sting"" is a masterpiece in the brilliance of its script driven by an unforgettable supporting cast, with a honorable mention to Charles Durning as the poor Snyder, and the whole thing is disguised under a deliberate coolness and detachment because up there, the staging and these pieces of the puzzles were still hanging in a confident string hold by a film-maker who knows his business.",The Sting

It's set up to play out much like the big con it portrays and, while its final reveal didn't sneak up on me the way it is intended to, it successfully manages to cleverly subvert expectation and consistently deliver devilishly fun solutions to its smart little problems. 7/10",The Sting

This film really surprised me because I was expecting a period-piece drama with some action but instead I got a film that is quite funny despite some dramatic moments. This film confused me at times and it will require a second viewing, but that doesn't stop me from really liking this film.George Roy Hill's film is about how two con men, one older and the other young, who team up to set up a big con against a mob boss who murdered a mutual friend of theirs.This film is well-acted. Robert Redford was a young stud back in the day and he shows some fierceness in this role. Paul Newman is one of the greatest actors ever and this film is an example why. However, I really like Charles Durning's performance as the detective. It was funny to see him act like he's boss.Overall, this is a very good con film and it's full of twists and surprises which will come at very unexpecting moments. Films like this makes me long for the 1970's quality filmmaking that today's directors have come to forget. Don't get me wrong, I like today's films very much, but I wish these kind of films were still being made. I rate this film 9/10.",The Sting

46,secondtake,"A happy, pretty, fun, engaging, but shallow film...pure great entertainment",7,2 February 2010,"The Sting (1973)A simple bold calculation that Rob Roy Hill directing two charming beautiful men in another period ""buddy movie"" would make big bucks was easy. The Sting was huge in its day. But lucky for all of us, it also made a wonderful if not great film, an entertaining film above all. And it gave us more time with Robert Redford and Paul Newman, which is never a bad thing.The first film, Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid (1969) was sensationally popular and influential. And is and was a better movie. For one thing, The Sting avoids any real tragedy. For another, by the very nature of being left out of the main character's heads as they scheme away (to leave us in suspense), we are not drawn into their world, their worries, their characters. In a way, this is the big let down overall. We are made to watch the movie, not get absorbed into it. There is real romance. The Butch Cassidy ""good friends who don't know each other after all"" feeling, with its poignancy and humor, is missing here. And even their friendship, which is confusing on purpose on screen, is never for real. Everything, top to bottom, on the surface and deep, is for convenience, and for effect.That's not necessarily a bad thing. But in a way, this is a return to the kind of early 1960s movie-making that the late 1960s have become so famous for upending, including Hill's own Butch Cassidy, which is more raw and alive and beautiful than The Sting by far. Yet, besides all the critical picking away, The Sting is a fast, layered, well done movie, with incredible period sets. The music is beautiful but odd (ragtime is a pre-1920s New Orleans style and the movie is post-1920s Chicago), but is maybe another example of how the director and team decided to go for sucking people in and having them enjoy themselves. And that's exactly what happens.",The Sting

Every moment has extra significance and is part of some larger plan, turning over every expectation and leaving us guessing.

The music and sets also show a detailed and immersive view of Depression-era Chicago, giving a gritty background to all the crime and cons going on.",The Sting
49,redryan64,"Getting' back at the Bad Guys in the Best Way, Hittin' 'em real hard in the ol' pocket book! And leavin' 'em not even knowin' 'bout it!",10,29 October 2007,"The overwhelmingly popular success and critical acclaim achieved by the teaming of Paul Newman and Robert Redford in BUTCH CASSIDY AND THE SUNDANCE KID(1969) demanded that there be another project which featured the re-teaming of the two. The two were a little long in the tooth for a 'Prequel' like the BUTCH AND SUNDANCE, THE EARLY YEARS (1979) With Tom Berrenger as Butch and William Katt as 'Sundance'. So the problem shows its ugly head! What to do? What to do? So what to do? Let's first forget Butch and Sundance and change the setting of the story and retool the relationship a little. Oh sure, we'll keep it a 'Buddy Film', but there still will be both conflicts and special moments of bonding. (No, Schultz, I didn't say ""Bondage!"")So, the scenario of THE STING was put on the table. In it we had all the proper roles we needed and then some. Once again, in the 'Proverbial Nut Shell' we have a young ""Kid"", Johnny Hooker (Redford)growing up in the Streets of Joliet, Illinois. He has learned to hustle and grab a little dough, here and there by way of the 'Confidance' Game. (""Con Game"", if you prefer.) He and his pal, Joe Erie/""The Erie Kid""(Jack Kehoe) have learned the various scams from veteran Grifter Luther Coleman (Robert Earl Jones).One day, quite by accident, they con a guy on the Street, who just so happens to be a Runner (Messenger) for an Illegal Bookie Operation. They wind up with Thousand$ of Dollar$ more than they ever dreamed about, let alone see. With that one Big Score, Luther announces that he's retiring and wants Hooker & Erie to go to Chicago to meet up with an old friend and Big Time Grifter, Henry Gondorf (Paul Newman).Meanwhile, the corrupt Bunco Squad Cop of the Joliet P.D., Lieutennant William Snyder (Charles Durning) gets into the act by confronting him, telling the story of how that the 'Big Score' was Mob Money and the ""Boys"" would be looking for him. He also demands the share of the Take that's Hooker's be forked over to him.Upon finding his friend Luther Coleman dead, killed by the Mob's Hit men. Hooker flees the scene for Chicago, vowing to avenge Luther's Murder, some how, some way.The plot continues with his going to the Metropolis of Chicago in order to meet Mr. Gondorf, explain his idea to pull the ""Big Con"" on the responsible New York Gangster, one Doyle Lonnegan (Robert Shaw).The world of the 'Con Man' or 'Grifter' is revealed to be a most happy, cooperative and even ""Damon Runionesque"" place, where all get along so well and looking out for their mutual well being! What a great system, and all during the middle of 'The Great Depression!' The production boasts of a truly outstanding cast, who seem to have absolutely nailed their parts very well indeed. We had the likes of Eileen Brennan as Billie, Henry Gondorf's 'Woman' and ""keeper of a really spiffy little ""house"", hidden in the Amusement Park. Dimitra Arliss makes an appearance as Hooker's woman, and one night stand.' Harold Gould's portrayal of ""Kid Twist"" is excellent and even pivotal to the story.* Then we have a most amusing team-up of Charles Dierkop** and Les Paul as a 'Mutt and Jeff' team of Bodyguards for Big Shot Gangster Lonnegan. And it would not be proper to make a review of this without at least mentioning people like: Ray Walston, John Heffernan, Dana Elcar, James Sloyan, Sally Kirkland, Avon Long, Arch Johnson, Leonard Barr***, Pauline Myers, Larry D.Mann, Joe Tornatore, John Quade, Ed Bakey, Arch Johnson, Jack Collins, Tom Spratley, Kenneth O'Brien, Ken Sansom, Ta-Tanisha, William ""Billy"" Benedict***, Patricia Bratcher, Chuck Morrell and Guy Way.In making the ""Heroes"" of our story the Grifters, themselves, the ""mark"" would have to be portrayed as a total scum bag of a person, a lowlife of the lowest order. If not, the fact that these guys cheat unsuspecting citizens of otherwise honestly earned money would throw a totally different light on things, There are no ""Robin Hoods"" out there! (See Also: PAPER MOON (1973).NOTE * The character of Kid Twist (Harold Gould) is most likely patterned on famous real-life, big time Con Man of Chicago, ""Yellow Kid"" Weil.NOTE: ** BUTCH CASSIDY veteran (as ""Flatnose"" Curry) Charles Diekop & Les Paul play a most amusing (as well as menacing) pair of ""Mutt & Jeff"" Bodyguards. (Hooker even calls them that once!) NOTE *** The Burlesque Comedian, Leonard was played by Leonard Barr, Dean Martin's real life Uncle.

To succeed this he teams up with a bigger con to win a fortune from a criminal banker. In this movie we have plenty of twists and last minute alterations.I liked this movie because of the plot and the storyline but I have to say that I have seen even better movies than this. Of course when we watch a movie of 1973 then we have to criticize it with the criteria of that time and we can not put it into a comparison with todays movies. In addition to this I have to say that the plot for that time was really good and the direction of it which was made by George Roy Hill was equally good. Paul Newman who played as Henry Gondorff was for one more time simply outstanding. Another interpretation that it had to be mentioned is Robert Redford's who played as Johnny Hooker and he was really good at his part.Finally I believe that ""The Sting"" is a really good movie to watch and have nice time and as I said before if we have to compare it with the standards of that time then it was a brilliant success for that times. Also we have to mention that this movie is considered as one of the most famous and best crime movies of all times and if you only watch it you will understand why, but when you watch it you have to think how old this movie is.",The Sting

The Sting is an entertaining, attractive, well scored, well acted, well costumed sweetmeat that somehow caught the public's imagination and rode its box office success to the Academy Awards. The vapid script by no means qualifies it as a great caper flick, with Rififi, Topkapi, and even the rather poor Deadfall (1968) running rings round it. The film looks great, but its take on the 1920s if strictly of the chocolate box variety, and Redford really should have been given a haircut before production began. The Sting does feature a fine performance by Robert Earl Jones as a co-conspirator, who, (***spoiler warning***) being African-American, comes to a sticky demise early in the proceedings.

Then he meets up with Gondorff(Newman), a seasoned veteran to bring down a mobster. The tricks of the mens' moves are simple; switching cards, rubbing noses, and blood capsules and phony bullets.

These grifters are fun guys to pal around with. Doyle (Shaw) is the sort of jerk you just love to hate. Unfortunately, all of this style is put to service for a very silly plot.I realize that as a heist film the silliness of the caper is part of the joy, but I just can't get over the practical aspects of the con. No less than 30 guys are in on it. No less than 20,000 dollars was spent on it. (Abet some of this was pay-as-you go grifting). No less than 3 different teams were work in independent efforts to pull it off. It is simply incredible, as in it is not credible, the planned worked. Human beings can't do that, especially among a bunch of untrustworthy con artists. Someone somewhere would have mucked up the plan.

62,jimbo-53-186511,Reeling in a big fish.... (POSSIBLE MINOR SPOILERS),7,25 May 2016,"September 1936 Chicago; a young grifter Johnny Hooker (Robert Redford) and his partner-in-crime Luther Coleman (Robert Earl Jones) are pleased as punch when they pull off the con of their lifetimes. Their elation is short-lived when the men learn that the money they stole belonged to a man who was part of mob boss Doyle Lonnegan's crew (Robert Shaw). As a result of this, Hooker's partner Coleman gets killed by Lonnegan's men. Realising that killing Lonnegan would present too much of a challenge, Hooker teams up with master of the con and mutual friend of Coleman's Henry Gondorff (Paul Newman). The two men set about fleecing as much money from Lonnegan as possible and have many cunning tricks up their sleeves in order to achieve this objective.The Sting is another film that gave us the dream pairing of Newman & Redford who both appeared in Butch Cassidy and The Sundance Kid a mere 4 years before this film was released. Individually both Redford and Newman are excellent - although I've always preferred Newman myself out of the two actors. However when they're on screen together the chemistry between the two men is wonderful and they're simply a joy to watch together.Of course for a film like The Sting to be successful it needs more than just Newman and Redford; it needs an engaging story and solid support from the rest of the cast to really make it work and again it succeeds in both these areas. Not only is there plenty of fun to be had from watching The Sting but there's also plenty to be interested in; Gondorff and Hooker aren't merely content with just taking Lonnegan for a few thousand dollars, but they are intent on humiliating him and completely ruining him and the various ways that they achieve their goals are very entertaining.I also got the impression when watching this film that there was a hidden subtext about greed; when you think about it Lonnegan chose to believe that Hooker was trying to help him take Gondorff down even after Gondorff had cheated him out of thousands of dollars and even though he knows that Gondorff and Hooker know each other. Some may see Lonnegan trusting Hooker to be far-fetched and not believable. However, I saw it that Lonnegan's own greed clouded his judgement which is why he initially went along with this part of the con. Naturally as the story progressed, Hooker and Gondorff dangled several carrots in front of Lonnegan which made him believe that he was going to make himself a fortune. They actually say that most of the time it's people's own greed that allows them to get conned and in some ways the subtext here suggests that it is a Cautionary tale on the evils of greed. This was one reason that put the film up a notch for me as it's probably more clever and insightful than people give it credit for.I've touched upon the performances of Newman and Redford (who are both great here), but some of the supporting cast are also very good such as Shaw & Durning - the former has a calm understated menace about him and is good fun to watch. The latter hammed it up to the ninth, but again he was great to watch in the various scenes that he was involved with. The score in The Sting is also good and memorable.The Sting for me isn't an entirely perfect film; it does have some slow sections and suffers from the odd lull now and again. The ending isn't as surprising as I suspect that the filmmakers thought that it would be, but again it's still great fun. It's definitely worth watching though.",The Sting

Hooker'd rather ice Lonnegan outright, but will settle for a big con with the help of a slightly wobbly but game scammer named Henry Gondorff, played as only Paul Newman can.Newman and Redford, along with director George Roy Hill, had a lot riding on this pony, given it was a follow-up to their earlier ""Butch Cassidy And The Sundance Kid."" To measure up, they had to produce nothing short of another classic. And so they did. ""The Sting"" won the Best Picture Oscar in 1973, and remains the sentimental favorite among many in choosing between the two films.Comparing ""The Sting"" to ""Butch Cassidy"" is kind of overdone sport, and tempers, as Lonnegan would say, run hot. But you can see why ""The Sting"" worked as well as it did by looking at how the director and the stars played it differently within the same basic framework as ""Butch Cassidy."" Newman and Redford are again outlaws and underdogs. Period detail abounds here as it did with ""Butch Cassidy,"" and there's another memorable score amid the proceedings, Scott Joplin rags modernized by Marvin Hamlisch. The score even produced another hit, ""The Entertainer,"" to compare with ""Raindrops Keep Falling On My Head.""What's different about ""The Sting,"" and what makes it such a classic in its own right, is the way the stars service the plot. In ""Butch Cassidy,"" Newman and Redford's comradeship was the story. Here, the chemistry between the two actors is minimized in favor of spinning a yarn with enough red herrings to feed the Swedish navy. The tale here is better than ""Butch Cassidy,"" which is a more elegiac film with grander cinematography and funnier set pieces. ""The Sting"" is an edge-of-your-seat caper flick from beginning to end.You can't really call ""The Sting"" a comedy. Though there are many laughs, especially when Newman hooks Shaw during a poker game, Hill won't let the audience relax enough for that. What this is is a con game, played on the audience, designed not to cheat but entertain by means of clever hoodwinking and constant misdirection plays.You'll get no spoilers from me. This is one worth sitting through with no expectations. Five gets you ten you'll enjoy Newman and Redford, and a terrific supporting cast (one advantage over ""Butch Cassidy"") that includes Charles Durning, Eileen Brennan, Dana Elcar, Harold Gould, and Mr. Hand himself, Ray Walston. There's another familiar face from ""Butch Cassidy,"" Charles Dierkop, Flat Nose Curry in ""Butch Cassidy"" and Lonnegan's right hand here. The best performance may be Robert Shaw's; he exudes menace aplenty but some humanity, too, when he takes Hooker under his wing after learning he came from the same hard streets of Five Points Lonnegan sprang from.Terrific period detail, too. The dialogue is great and feels real in its Runyonesque way, while the cons are elaborate and logically played out. Watching this a second time is especially fun because once you know how the plot goes down, you find yourself catching clues you missed the first time, and enjoying the film even more for them.Why didn't Newman and Redford team up again? Certainly there was another good movie for them to partner up in, but as Gondorff would have put it, only chumps don't quit when they're ahead.",The Sting
67,gcd70,"Great script, ending worth the wait",7,16 August 2007,"""The Sting"" is a very clever tale about a small time confidence man (Robert Redford) who seeks revenge on a big time gangster (Robert Shaw).The plot, from writer David S. Ward, is the definite attraction here, and director George Roy Hill lets it speak for itself. There are no wasteful, lavish sets and no silly overacting. However neither Robert Redford, Paul Newman nor Robert Shaw deliver performances worth raving about. The film also starred Charles Durning, Eileen Brennan and Harold Gould.A little sluggish in the middle, but do not despair; hang on for a fabulously surprising ending. Enjoyable viewing.Sunday, November 24, 1991 - Video",The Sting
68,aharmas,"entertaining, yet not quite perfection",7,22 October 2005,"I saw this movie when I was a kid and remember it didn't quite make a good impression on me. There were many aspects of it that I remembered fondly: its music, its look, the star quality of its main actors, and yet, it didn't move the ways other 70's movies did. It didn't have the shock and anguish of the ""The Exorcist"", a movie with plenty of humanity under its still impressive special effects. It didn't connect with me in the way ""The Paper Chase"" related to the subversive in all young people share. ""Chinatown"" wrapped itself around its audience like a sad song, and ""Cabaret"" chilled us with its disintegration of life as we know it. ""The Sting"" was impressive but it was like that work behind the glass: untouchable, and yet something worth admiring. I look back and can't help thinking how ""Paper Moon"" brought back an era, with its flaws, humanity, and spirit quite intact.What works: The screenplay is rather dazzling, a labyrinthine construction of twists and turns, executed with almost clinical perfection. The players play others, get played, get bullied, and titter on the edge. It is like reading a book people recommend and never quite getting into it. Sometime its dazzle prevents us from looking at its heart.Both Redford and Newman are downright amazing, with terrific costumes and million dollar smiles. They're both attractive and carry the film very well, especially Newman who brings forth the qualities of wisdom and experience to the part. Redford is competent and does a decent job, sometimes coasting on Newman's powerful acting. Years later, Tom Cruise would give one of its best performances in ""The Color of Money"", once again trying to keep up with Newman's expertise. In a minor role, Gould shines as the team player who must adapt chameleon qualities to survive. Brennan, Durning, and Walston fit in nicely.The score helps with the feeling of nostalgia for those who might have lived in the period. Its simple and belongs to the classes the movie portrays; there are no airs of culture, but a sassy quality, with plenty of attitude.What is a little problematic:The film feels directed, cold, and uninvolving, keeps winking at us, telling us how ""good"" and ""clever"" it is. Hill's direction is never relaxed, but calculated and precise. Directors are like painters, showing their personality in their work. Less admired works, such as the drama in ""Titanic"" might show less directorial expertise, but more human sentient, allowing its actors and audience to bond. Earlier this year, another potential masterpiece was ruined by a filmmaker that has already proved himself quite capable of directing a ""safe"" bet of a film, keeping himself away from taking chances in ""Cinderella Man"". Much is to be learned from directors who take chances such as Peter Jackson in the three ""LOTR"" efforts, films that could have collapsed by his choices to show exhilarating and extended scenes showing us the passion and energy he felt in the prose of the novels. His amazing displays of technical knowledge worked well because he wasn't afraid to take it further. His actors showed charisma and made us care, with the rest of the canvas finely structured to support the overall effect. ""Chinatown"" still haunts us because its portrayal of the lower qualities in every human being were raw, uncompromising, part of the ""film noir"" atmosphere Polanki tried to recreated. In ""The Sting"" its photographic is at best pedestrian, and one can't help feel as if we're watching a TV production, rather than a work of art.Yes, ""The Sting"" is a finely crafted work, but its heart is not big and strong; as a matter of fact, it might be its weakest component, surrendering to the powerful brain that keeps trying to impress us. If you want to feel moved, refer to the other pieces of the 70's exploring the early 90's. There are much finer twists in ""Chinatown"", much heartfelt cons in ""Paper Moon"" and more clever displays of talent in ""Bugsy Malone"".",The Sting
69,Steffi_P,"""Nickel and dime grifters""",9,22 January 2011,"The best-known and most widely applauded picture of the early 70s may be The Godfather, a tale of rivalry and honour among the upper echelons of organised criminality, but there has long been an unwritten rule that the real popular heroes of the crime genre are the small-time crooks. These guys are underdogs both in the legitimate and illegitimate worlds, and it is incredibly satisfying to see them get one over on those seemingly-untouchable mob bosses. This makes The Sting enjoyable by virtue of its premise alone.It's lucky that The Sting, scripted by David S. Ward, is such an entertaining work, as one must pay close attention to follow its jigsaw-like plot. One of the great things about the story is the way that lead character Johnny Hooker is made our gateway into the film's world – his level of crime is so modest, and he in effect plays the part of a pupil to more experienced mobsters, that we can feel as if are learning alongside him. Ward sets up a great writer's trick to ensure we sympathise with him from the offset. When the movie opens we start by following the errand boy whom Hooker and Coleman are about to hustle. We twice see him creepily hassling a secretary, which makes him a rather unpleasant figure to most audience members. Hence when Hooker dupes him in the following scene, Hooker instantly becomes a hero.And Redford is such an excellent choice to play Hooker. There is a fresh-faced honesty to him, but he also has enough presence that we can believe the resourcefulness that his character shows. He gives such a likable presentation that we can even forgive him for tossing an old lady out of a phone booth. A whole lot of the movie is played out on Redford's face, which director George Roy Hill really focuses upon, and the actor lives up to the demands with some great expressive moments, such as his little flash of guilt when Paul Newman asks if anyone has been giving out counterfeit money. Newman himself is of course great too, although one of the few flaws in The Sting is that he plays more of a supporting role here, and this is far less of a buddy movie than the great Newman-Redford pairing Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid. Still, the older actor gets to steal a small portion of the film with his drunk act that he gradually sheds in the boxcar poker game sequence.All this is overseen by George Roy Hill's assured direction. As is typical in Hill's movies, he begins with an unusual focus in his shots, in this case following a pair of feet in close-up, which arouses our curiosity without allowing us to pay too much attention to the identity of a man who will not become a major character. Hill then settles into a more straightforward visual style, in which his main priority is simply focusing us on the characters that matter. At one end of the scale he uses lighting and arrangement to make Redford an almost continual focal point in every shot, while often keeping minor characters in profile or further back in the set, and only throwing in an insert of an object when totally necessary.However, as was often the case in the late 60s and early 70s, The Sting is a picture that was very much made in post-production. A neat aspect is the sound design, especially in the train journey scenes, where the eerie Doppler-effected sound of bells during moments of silence really underscores the tension. Then there is the music, Scott Joplin's rags admittedly being anachronistic (ragtime was popular in the 1890s and 1900s, but was all but forgotten by the 1930s), but expertly capturing the tone of the movie. Great fun is had with the Marvin Hamlisch arrangements, such as the scene in which Redford gets a makeover, in which the cuts from one place to another match the change from a single piano to an orchestral version. The use of The Easy Winners and The Entertainer in a couple of chase scenes gives them a jaunty feel rather than an intense one, and it is touches like this which really round off the playful nature of The Sting, making it a light-hearted antidote to the heavygoing drama of so many other crime pictures.",The Sting

71,onepotato2,The big Sell,2,9 March 2008,"If your movie has high production values, attractive stars, and doesn't trip over anything major before it ends, most people on this site will start their rating at 7 or 8 stars. That's how low the bar is for a rave. And it's why I don't much care for movies like The Sting. It's idea of film merit is to pre-sell the production so they don't have to worry about people comprehending anything or thinking about much. This movie proves that if you market some star power and a little production design you can trick people into thinking they've seen a great movie. It's so sure that its casting director and designers did a fantastic job, that it fails put much energy into it's characters or story. It's not as well-designed or produced as movies both before and after. It's not too interesting, it's not much fun and though some people describe it as 'funny' I can't name a line I laughed at. It's just an overinflated period piece. Robert Redford, though attractive, seems lifeless and miscast.The cinematography is much too bright and evenly lit like a TV production. It flattens out the cheap looking exteriors. The whole thing would benefit from a better understanding of noir. Except for a handful of establishing matte shots, the movie is extremely careful not to let much more than fifteen feet of a set into view, producing a claustrophobic feeling. I don't need to see Al Capone in a 1930s Chicago storyline, but not even mentioning him is bizarre. With 7 Oscars wins, The Sting is the classic story of popularity overcoming lack of merit. But I'd bet there is virtually no audience for it that didn't first see it back in the 70s. It may be the least worthy Best Picture winner, but of course there are plenty to choose from.",The Sting
72,Seraphion,A mixed understanding for a kid of different time frame,7,15 October 2015,"The story is nicely constructed, taking use of the duration to elaborate on the original motive of the daring move, as well as the careful planning, recruitment and staged execution of the big con.But that's the view I get when I put myself in the shoes of people of the seventies, at the time this movie was out. Now, with the significant advance in technology, and also the many modern con and heist movies with comparable plot twists and turns, this movie seems dwarfed by all those. Also I see that the movie didn't do enough justice on side characters that turns out to have quite a significance at the end, like Loretta. These characters don't develop well enough to be well explained. The acting overall is quite good. I think I now know how Tom Cruise gets his usual trademark of grinning almost all the time in most of his roles. Paul Newman did great in portraying the con artist, with all the necessary ""acting within acting"". Robert Shaw also played very well, maintaining the expressions of suspicion and greed within.",The Sting

Some say deservedly so but that is why I sort of don't give it a higher rating. 'The Sting' incredibly won over 'The Exorcist', which I regard as the finest movie ever made! Obviously the Academy awards look down on horror movies but a comedic con caper can never be quite the same quality (and no where near as powerful); although the superstars of Newman and Redford demand the attention. I even find the acclaimed musical score sort of irritating.",The Sting

75,eric262003,A Classic Caper Movie That Stands The Test of Time,9,15 October 2012,"Written by screenwriter David Ward and directed by George Roy Hill, this film practically dominated the Oscars back in 1974 with ten nominations and seven wins one was for Best Director and for Best Picture. It also saw the reunion of ""Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid"" alums Hill along with Robert Redford and Paul Newman collaborating again for another Oscar winning film that which added another star to their already more impressive resume. But what's peculiar is that Butch and Sundance made the top 50 on AFI's top 100, ""The Sting"" didn't even place. I mean what gives? Even more odd was that Butch and Sundance lost the Best Picture Award in 1970 that year to the equally poignant ""Midnight Cowboy"". While ""Butch and Sundance"" was funny and more entertaining,""The Sting"" was superior in terms of intelligence and the plot twists have very unexpected outcomes. The cinematography really captures the scope of the Great Depression era subliminally and the caper elements are quite ironic and subtle rather than obvious. And it matches the scenes in an immaculate perspective. The props and locations were very accurate to the time settings and I give a lot of praise to costume designer Edith Head for providing such exquisite costumes that gives the Depression era of America that certain look like you've travelled back in time and lived in that time even if it's two hours long. The musical score by Scott Joplin and Marvin Hamlisch gives the music of the area a fitting look.that matches the time period this movie takes place.While in ""Butch"" Newman was the central character there, ""The Sting"", it's clear that Redford runs the show and rightfully earned his Best Actor nomination Redford's character Johnny Hooker is the perfect blend of charm, charisma and a clear mischievous demeanor to go along with the package. Paul Newman is more a background player here as veteran schemer Henry Gondorff who sets up his assembly and oversees its execution. Newman's performance is still as equally exhilarating as Redford's only his portrayal has more of a tough guy approach than a colorful one that Redford's Johnny Hooker. A hats off goes to Robert Shaw as mob boss Doyle Lonnegan, for his brilliant supporting role. Other honorable mentions goes out to Charles Durning, Ray Walston and Eileen Brennan for carrying out their performances brilliantly. With a tight plot that fun and entertaining, ""The Sting"" will surely please the true blue movie watchers out there.",The Sting
76,pc95,All-Around Superb Movie,9,26 December 2012,"Directed by George Roy Hill, ""The Sting"" is one of the best movies of the 70s and in my opinion cinema history. Justifiably it was winner of Best Picture. It features an outstanding cast, competent settings, costumes, and best of all an exciting storyline. You could point to several stand-out scenes, but my personal favorite was the train set-up with Newman and Shaw. I thought Newman completely nailed it in every respect. Watching cheater Lonigan (Robert Shaw) fume and get cheated at cards with flamboyant and snide Newman was acting at it's all around finest and most entertaining from all involved. This movie is a classic in all regards. It may be easy to guess what's going on but that doesn't really detract from it. Highly Recommended",The Sting
77,Chase_Witherspoon,You won't get conned watching this classic,10,3 May 2012,"Never to be repeated classic showcasing the talents of three kings of the cinema with Redford as the talented con artist prematurely propelled into the big time when his mentor (Jones) is killed by the mob under direction from big wig racketeer (Shaw). He joins forces with legendary con artist (Newman) in an attempt to pull off an elaborate ""big con"" on Shaw, and take him for all he's worth as a square up. Redford has an impressive CV, and his performance as the uneducated, street wise confidence trickster is one of its supreme highlights. Ably supported but not outshone by Newman as the wise owl, whose steadying influence protects Redford from sinister interests, Robert Shaw is also great as a ruthless crime boss whose only vulnerability appears to be his greed. The supporting cast of Gould, Walston, Brennan, Dierkop, Elcar, Kehoe, Jones, Arliss and Durning in particular as the corrupt local detective out of his depth, all perform to the tee. There's also a plethora of familiar faces in bit parts (e.g. John Quade, Billy Benedict, Jack Collins, Sally Kirkland, James Sloyan etc).With a memorable score of Scott Joplin phone jingles, terrific sets depicting 1930's Chicago and palpable tension (the card game aboard the train has more suspense than most so-called thrillers), director Hill has fashioned a highly original drama-comedy that is close to, if not flawless. The plot of course contains contrivances and a fair degree of poetic licence is exercised, but it doesn't in my opinion, lessen the superb quality. Just don't get stung bothering with this film's inferior sequel (read remake).",The Sting

Buoyed by the windfall, Luther announces his retirement and advises Hooker to seek out an old friend, Henry Gondorff, in Chicago to teach him ""the big con"".

For a while, it is a preposterous but light-hearted revenge flick that slowly turns serious. Just when I was expecting a dark ending you pulled another surprise on me, George. And then another. And then one more. The bittersweet main theme by Scott Joplin is played quite regularly to con us. I'm going to be playing it in my car for a while.Apart from Newman and Redford, there is a great supporting cast. Robert Shaw, Charles Durning, Eileen Brennan and so many others. The film is up to its head in great actors - all of whom are remarkable. You cannot take your eye off any of them.And those sets. Yes, its all a bit run down. But the brown of those decaying walls.

82,KnightsofNi11,The quintessential con film,8,21 September 2011,"Classic con film. Classic Redford. Classic Newman. The Sting is just a classic. It's the story of a young con man named Johnny Hooker who is out for revenge against the scrupulous banker named Doyle Lonnegan who murdered his long time partner in crime. Hooker teams up with renowned con man Henry Gondorff to swindle Lonnegan through a very elaborate con involving a fake horse race betting house. As the con becomes more complex the stakes grow ever higher and Hooker finds himself more and more at risk going up against the violent Lonnegan. The Sting tells an immaculate story full of twists and turns that keep one entertained from start to finish. It's got a vivacious atmosphere and charming personality that entertains, engages, and delivers a fantastically good time.There is a specific image we all get in our heads when we think modern classics. The term pertains more to films that have come out in the last ten years or so, but in the grand scheme of things it more appropriately applies to films of the 70's and 80's. The Sting is such a film that fits that image of a classic 70's flick. It has some of the most dashing actors of the time, it is a big budget period piece that captures a time so vividly and so intelligently, and it delivers the cadence of a classic film that all kinds of people can enjoy and relate to. The Sting isn't a film that focuses on one demographic. It is a film that can be enjoyed by people with all different tastes. If you love slower and more methodical films, you can enjoy The Sting plenty. If you lean more towards action blockbusters you can hopefully still appreciate the fun filled quality of The Sting. It's also a film that young and old can enjoy. It isn't by any means a kids film but it isn't strictly geared towards an adult audience either. It has dashes of comedy, slices of suspense, and is full of wild entertainment. It's easy to see why this won best picture in 1973. It is a film for everyone.Now, I've talked a lot about the various tastes of people that can enjoy The Sting, and I don't specifically fall into one of those categories so I just liked The Sting all around. I found it to be incredibly entertaining and lots of fun. It is a very well written, well directed, and superbly well acted film with an easily recognizable calibre of quality to it. It's one of those films that I feel I appreciate more than love, and there's nothing wrong with that. I have plenty of respect for films that are as well made as The Sting, even if they aren't my favorite movies of all time. But a critique like that is tedious and redundant, so what I will finish with is that I thoroughly enjoyed The Sting and found it to be a very well made film that outshines many of the films that try to do what it does. It is the quintessential con film that now has a hidden legacy that pops up a lot these days in films that are good, but is never quite as refined as The Sting.",The Sting

84,gab-14712,How to Pull Off a Heist!,9,18 October 2017,"If you have never seen The Sting before, my recommendation is to see it immediately. This is such a fun, wonderful movie and it's another example why 1973 was a great year in movies. The film is very stylish to look at and it gave me the authentic 1930s feeling although I get a feeling the art designer went a little beyond the authenticity. That being said, the production design and the costumes are excellent features of this movie. But not only is this film stylish, it also has a deep plot. Credit goes to director George Roy Hill for making this movie understandable and enjoyable for the mass audience. The movie does have a tendency to get overly complicated at times because of all the twists and turns that come out of nowhere-and to great effect. The first time I watched the movie, I fell in love with it but I was completely lost by the ending in the final showdown. My second viewing had me understand what was going on and that is all because of the excellent directing by Hill.If you only had two words to describe the plot, the best two words to use would be ""revenge con."" After all, this story is about revenge but not in the typical violent way. Revenge is got in the way of performing a big con. Anyway, Henry Gondorff (Paul Newman) and Johnny Hooker (Robert Redford) are two con men who meet up due to the murder of a mutual friend. Henry is an older, more accomplished con man while Johnny is a young man, but despite his great talent, he can be rash and cocky. They get together to avenge the death of their friend, which was caused by the mob boss, Doyle Lonnegan (Robert Shaw). Featuring a poker game, a fake wire room for horse bets, the involvement of the police, and many twists and turns, this story will take you for a fun ride.The writing and direction are big reasons why this film was successful, but another reason was the acting. Paul Newman and Robert Redford are not actors I would normally call funny, but here they inhabit their characters with some comedy and it works out perfectly. Newman brings a veteran presence in this movie and as always, he does a magnificent job in the role as Henry. He made Henry a drunk, but a very competent and skilled con man who turns into almost a father figure for Johnny. Robert Redford is a star on the rise and this movie, which nominated him for an Academy Award, helped him achieve stardom. He was very charming here and the way he pulls of his cons make him even more charming. Robert Shaw excels at playing the villain, so its no surprise how well he does as Doyle Lonnegan. Shaw gives the mob boss an aura of menace and if you watch the poker game between Shaw and Newman, you'll see just how effective Shaw is. Charles Durning plays the intimidating cop on everyone's trail and does well.The screenplay, written by David S. Ward, is one of the best screenplays I had the fortune to read. Sure his words were executed flawlessly on screen by the actors, but after all a good movie cannot exist with a bad screenplay. Ward gave his movie excellent dialogue, a fast pace, and many twists that can be complicated. That is where we come into the directing. George Roy Hill directed the 1967 classic, Butch Sundance and the Cassidy Kid (which I haven't seen yet), but I hear how influential that movie is to modern cinema. This film needed good directing to make the story connect with the audience, and Hill does a magnificent job. This movie could have easily been a mumble jumble of a mess. The beginning scene where Redford performs a con worked beautifully thanks to Hill and the final hour where Newman and Redford had to pretend not to know each other, while taking turns to perform their beig heist on Lonnegan sounds impossible to do, but Hill did a wonderful job in making everything work.Another part of the movie that adds to the vibrant, fun aura of the movie is the music, which was adapted by Marvin Hamslich. He makes good use of Scott Joplin's ragtime music. His music faded from popularity by the 1930's (the decade of this film), but his music still had the perfect kind of tone this movie had. This is another reason why I loved the movie: to listen to the great music.I very much enjoyed The Sting. It was a very fun movie to watch from start to finish. The movie tended to get a little complicated at times, but the direction of film is why the movie did not lose me. This was superbly written and wonderfully acted. Newman and Redford looked like they were having fun and they have great chemistry together. The movie looked very stylish thanks to the art direction and costume designs. This movie gave off a fun atmosphere and that's all I wanted. Nominated for ten Oscars and winning seven of them (including Best Picture and Director), this film is a must-see if you want an entertaining movie.My Grade: A",The Sting
85,bankofmarquis,One of my top All Time Favorite Films,10,29 March 2020,"I'll come right out and say it - the 1973 Academy Award winning film for Best Picture, THE STING, is one of the greatest films of all time. It's well written, well acted, well directed with a memorable musical score and characters, situations, costumes and set design that become richer over time and through repeated viewings.Set in Chicago in the gangster-ridden, depression era mid-1930's, THE STING tells the tale of two con man who join forces for the ultimate con of a vile N.Y. Gangster who is responsible for killing a friend of theirs.From everything I have read about it, the script by David S. Ward (who won an Oscar for his work) arrived pretty much finished. He shaped the story of the con men - and the myriad pieces of misdirection - fully before shopping it around to the studios. Universal jumped all over it and tabbed veteran Director George Roy Hill (BUTCH CASSIDY AND THE SUNDANCE KID) to helm the picture. Hill - being no dummy - saw this as a vehicle to re-team Newman and Redford (stars of Butch Cassidy) and the rest...as they say...is history.Newman and Redford are perfectly cast as veteran grifter Henry Gondorff (Newman) and up and coming grifter Johnny Hooker (Redford). They have an ease of playing off of each other - each one complimenting the other one - both giving in their scenes with the other one which makes the scenes more rich and alive. They are joined by a veritable ""who's who"" of late '60's/early '70's character actors - Harold Gould, Eileen Brennan, Charles Durning, Ray Walston and Dana Elcar - all of them bring their ""A"" game and they are fun to watch. Special notice should be made to Robert Earl Jones (father of James Earl Jones) as Luther, the character who's fate propels the plot forward.But...none of this would work if you didn't have a ""bad guy"" that was interesting to watch - and to root against - and bad guys don't get much better...and badder...than Robert Shaw's Doyle Lonnegan. Shaw plays Lonnegan as a physically tough boss who doesn't suffer failure, but is smart enough to avoid obvious traps. He is a worthy adversary of Gondorff and Hooker's and it is fun to watch Newman, Redford and Shaw play off each other. One other note - it was with this performance that Universal recommended Shaw to young Director Stephen Spielberg for his ""shark flick"" JAWS.Edith Head won her 8th (and last) Oscar for the magnificent period costumes in this film and Marvin Hamlisch won for the Music - a surprising hit on the pop charts of re-channeled Scott Joplin tunes. The set design won an Oscar - as did the Director, George Roy Hill. All in all, the film won 7 out of the 11 Oscars it was nominated for (Redford was nominated for Best Actor, but did not win).THE STING is a well crafted film. One that tells a timeless story and that stands the test of time as a testament of how great of an achievement in film this is. It is one of my All Time favorites.Letter Grade: the rare A+5 stars (out of 5) and you can take that to the Bank(ofMarquis)",The Sting
86,Angry_Arguer,"Hill and Neuman and Redford, o my.",1,22 August 2003,"Before I began my analysis of The Sting, I studied how George Roy Hill works with Neuman and Redford in Butch & Sundance and how he manipulates his story in Slaughterhouse-Five.  I noticed that Hill never worries about impressions in his work, he only wants to entertain the audience at the expense of whatever brain cells they lose in the process.Consider his working of Slaughterhouse-Five, one of the greatest anti-war books ever written.  He strips it of fluidity, adds in his comic touches, then slaps the viewer in the head and makes you feel stupid for watching it in the beginning.  That's how all his films work.The Sting relies on similar principles.  Characters are not people, they are scenes to be created.  Hill is much like Richard Donner and Tennessee Williams in that respect.  Notice how Neuman and Redford plan their ""great con"" at the end.  It's all a facade to show that the film shakes on its feet like Jell-O.Overall, don't bother with this movie.  If you want GRH's best work, just watch Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid again.  2 out of 5 stars.",The Sting
87,spookyrat1,"Hookered, Line & Sinker!",9,2 November 2019,"The Sting is simply the most entertaining heist/con movie I've ever seen. The Butch Cassidy& Sundance trio of Paul Newman, Robert Redford and director George Roy Hill had been looking for the right vehicle to reunite their talents, to demonstrate the magic witnessed in the earlier western wasn't a fluke. They found it in the David S Ward screenplay about two grifters in 1936 Chicago, who throw up a long con aimed at a ruthless mob boss (Robert Shaw), in an effort to gain some revenge /pay back for the murder of Johnny Hooker's (Redford) mentor.Hill succeeds in not just reestablishing the charismatic pairing of Newman and Redford, but doing it in a compelling and completely new form, totally unlike the Butch and Sundance semi-historical tale. The Sting is a completely fictional story set in the mid 1930's, but drawing on some of the reputed exploits of several 1920's and 30's con artists.Hill recreates a mid-west America slowly shaking off the after-effects of the world's worst economic depression perfectly; and mainly filmed on a Universal Studios backlot. The production design, costumes and sets are first rate and brought beautifully to life through the lightly brown tinted cinematography of Robert L Surtees. Everything is only richly enhanced by Hill's decision to use the 30's flavoured illustrated inter-title cards introducing different sections of the long con and the Marvin Hamlisch adaptions and arrangements of Scott Joplin's ragtime piano-based tracks.The casting is impeccable. Besides the star billing of Newman and Redford, Robert Shaw as Doyle Lonnegan, again shows why he came to be regarded as such an enormous talent during the 1970's and why he has been so sadly missed after such a sudden, premature death. Among a big name littered supporting cast Harold Gould stands out as Kid Twist, Henry Gondorff's (Newman) right hand organisational man and Dimitra Arliss in the relatively small, but impacting part of Loretta Salino, an enigmatic waitress, attracting Hooker's eye.Unlike many other reviewers I tend to think The Sting, not denying its light touch, has a more dramatic feel that Butch Cassidy etc. which even during it's conspicuous moments, was never even slightly short of ironic one-liners and visual gags. The Sting breaks down the mechanism of a long con called The Wire, into accessible, intriguing, sequential parts that are logical and importantly never convoluted. Around this main storyline are wrapped several sub-plots concerned with Hooker's pursuit by a corrupt cop and Lonnegan's efforts to find and eliminate Hooker, for his part in an earlier successful con played against one of Lonnegan's men, carrying the proceeds of a numbers racket. The extended third act sees multiple deceptions and a surprise ending guaranteed to satisfy the hardest to please of audiences.There was little argument raised back in 1974, when The Sting won 7 Academy awards including Best Picture. It does seem a shame however, in a modern era of franchises and never-ending sequels, that there was never to be a third chapter involving Hill, Redford and Newman, even if only to see whether gold touched the same trio a third time.",The Sting

Third is Surtees' cinematography. Fourth is the brilliant direction by George Roy Hill. Fifth are the actors: Paul Newman, Robert Shaw, and Robert Redford.

89,FilmOtaku,Thoroughly enjoyable,7,7 July 2005,"It's the 1930's and small-time con artist Johnny Hooker (Redford) makes himself a nice score in Joliet, Illinois with his partner Luther when they con a man on the street out of over $10,000. Luther takes this opportunity to step out of the life, and encourages Hooker to go big-time without him, giving him the name of a former associate, Henry Gondorff (Newman). Unfortunately, the man they have conned is actually a runner for a Chicago bookie whose boss turns out to be Doyle Lonnegan, (Shaw) one of the biggest crime bosses in the country. When Luther is killed as a result, and both the cops and Lonnegan's men on his tail, Hooker runs to Chicago to talk to Gondorff about setting up a major con, one that will target Lonnegan and hit him where it hurts; his wallet and his reputation.I actually remember seeing this film several times as a child, and knew that I really liked it, but I wasn't sure why. Watching the film as an adult sheds a new light on it, and the cleverness and wit of the script really is prevalent. Because the film is about con artists, one would expect that the script would contain some twists here and there, but the writer David S. Ward (Major League) and director George Roy Hill (Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid) are intent on conning the audience into thinking one thing rather than another as well. While the script is clever, the acting is just as enjoyable. Newman and Redford (who looks really young in this film, before he became leather face, then suddenly was taut a couple of years and no longer a leather face) have a definite chemistry, and both look as if they are having a great time being in this film. The supporting cast is basically a who's who of 1970's actors, including Eileen Brennan, Charles Durning, Ray Walston & Harold Gould.The beauty of period pieces is that they never really look outdated, and that is certainly the case with ""The Sting"". There have been a lot of films centering on con artists filmed both before and after 1973, when ""The Sting"" was released, but this is certainly in the upper echelon of the genre. It is easily recommended to anyone who enjoys both mainstream and more independent fare, and, if you're like me and may have seen it at a different stage in your life, think about revisiting ""The Sting""; you may get a lot more out of it than you originally did. 7/10 --Shelly",The Sting

In addition to all the things that others have praised, one of the most memorable features of this film is the use of a Scott Joplin rag, which both lends a distinctive period touch and adds a sense of fast-paced motion to the action.

However I can't believe I truly haven't.
Not least because it swept the board at the Academy Awards winning seven Oscar's and being nominated for ten in 1974.
However this is not a con and that's the backdrop to this 1930s period drama set in downtown Chicago.It is the screenplay that is so appealing about this film. The 'cons' are so elaborate yet funny at the same time watching hardened gangsters such as banker Doyle Lonnegan (Robert Shaw, with a questionable Irish accent) limping straight into them.Paul Newman is fantastic as Henry Gondorff exhibiting some comic timing that perhaps he wasn't renowned for as an actor and showing why he deserved equal billing with Steve McQueen in The Towering Inferno.Robert Redford is the other main billing as younger small-time con man Jonny Hooker who eventually teams up with Gondorff to take Lonnegan on.Look out for great 'con's' on a train ride game of poker between New York and Chicago, as well as the big con, an elaborate fake bookmakers and telegraph office to get fake horse race results.Throughout the film music provided by Marvin Hamlisch includes piano strains of the song The Entertainer by Scott Joplin.

""The Sting"" is a generally fast and fun film that features a clever script and some great acting by all involved.  This is often considered simply a Newman-Redford picture, but in my opinion, the best performance here was by Robert Shaw, who was simply brilliant.

97,tomimt,Star vehicle heist,7,17 June 2006,"'The Sting', if you like jolly heist movies, is an easy movie to like. It tells a tale of a con artist, who decides to avenge the death of his mentor and friend by cheating a notable amount of money from a man who was responsible of killing his friend. So there even is a slight moral in the story, not just stealing money from the heck of it.So the main players of the film are: Johnny Hooker (Robert Redford), who is the man who wants to revenge the death of his mentor with the help of Henry Gondorff (Paul Newman). So as you can see, the cast has the two huge starts of its own era in the lead. The chemistry of Redford and Newman works very well and they don't seem to be battling each other to gain more screen presence over each other. 'The Sting' is the kind of a movie, that will stand against the test of time relatively well, as it relies more on the actors and plot than anything else. I don't think it's the greatest heist film of all time, it actually can be said, that if the lead men would be someone else than Newman and Redford this film would barely be remembered, but it is entertaining and it carries through its duration very easily.",The Sting

99,FlickJunkie-2,The Quintessential Caper Flick,10,13 April 2001,"`The Sting' is an extremely well written story by David Ward (`Major League', `Sleepless in Seattle') and David Maurer about some smalltime grifters who attempt to swindle a mob boss.  The film was nominated for ten Academy Awards in 1974 and won seven Oscars including Best Picture and Best Director.  It reunited director George Roy Hill, Robert Redford and Paul Newman four years after their blockbuster, `Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid'.  Strangely, although Butch and Sundance made it to number 50 on AFI's top 100 of the century, this film did not make that list.  This is even more surprising since `Butch' did not win the Oscar for Best Picture in 1970 (`Midnight Cowboy' won it that year).While I think `Butch' is funnier and more exciting, this film is more intriguing with interesting character studies and some unpredictable plot twists.  Hill does a superb job of weaving the elements of the caper together and giving it a depression era feeling.  The humor is more ironic than hilarious, but it fits the story well.  The period props, locations, and sets are excellent, and the costumes are perfect.  The costumes were done by the legendary Edith Head, who designed costumes for over 400 films in her 50-year career.  She won an Oscar for best Costume Design for this film, which was one of eight she won in that category in a career marked by an astounding 34 Oscar nominations.  The music by Scott Joplin and Marvin Hamlisch is also fabulous, bestowing an early twentieth century flavor on the film, and giving Hamlisch one of three Oscars he won that year (the other two were for `The Way We Were' also starring Redford).Where `Butch' was probably a little more Newman's film, this film clearly belonged to Redford.  Redford, who was nominated for best actor for the role, is marvelous in the lead, giving his character a charming, lighthearted personality to go along with his scheming intellect.  Newman plays almost a supporting role as the veteran conman Henry Gondorff, who assembles the team for the caper and oversees its execution.  Despite the smaller part, Newman gives electrifying performance with his conniving tough guy portrayal.  Robert Shaw (`From Russia With Love', `A Man For All Seasons', `Jaws') is also terrific as mob boss Doyle Lonnegan.  Charles Durning (`The Best Little Whorehouse in Texas'), Ray Walston (TV's `My Favorite Martian') and Eileen Brennan (Private Benjamin') round out a splendid supporting cast with fantastic character portrayals.This film is entertaining and fun with a tight plot and wonderful period renderings.

103,khatcher-2,One of the all-time American Classics,8,13 October 2002,"Sometimes great things come out of America, but they are hardly ever presidents. As the saying goes: `in the United States of America, anyone can be president  and THAT is what usually happens.' I think the quote is from Ralph Whitman.Be as it may, when a work of art comes out, it is of no import as to whether it comes from the USA,  or from anywhere else: it stands up on its own merits.I am hardly a European with a naturally friendly disposition towards the USA, basically for the heavy-footed way in which that country conducts itself in international affairs. Even so, and with absolutely no intentions of making any kind of publicity, there is nothing which comes up to Kellogg's Corn Flakes, Kodak photographic film, Hewlett Packard printers, `The Grapes of Wrath' (the book, not any of the films), Malcolm Lowry, Charles Ives' Symphony nº 2, or Chief Seattle's purported speech in Duwamish in 1854, anywhere else in the world. In the case of cinematographics productions, it is not even important whether they win Oscars or any other awards. `The Sting' is, without any doubt, one of those truly fine pieces which only comes out every decade or so, with luck. This film is now deservedly one of the classics of North American cinema. For some years now I have had it on video, and of course I have Marvin Hamlish's arrangements of Scott Joplin's `Rags' in my collection. I dispute this film being called a `comedy': it is too good to be given such a simple epithet; that certain parts may be considered humorous is only because life itself must be humorous or would not be worth living. Fine interpretations all round, excellent scenification with all those old cars and the same old bus in several scenes, and those so authentically-looking 1930's Chicago streets. And all this so admirably backed up by Scott Joplin's `Rags': this is my one complaint  could they not have included more of this music in the film?Just the card game on the train is worth queueing up for; thirty years on `The Sting' is still worth 120 minutes of your time if you are able to value some finer aspects of film-making.With more than 13,000 votes giving a voting average of 8,3 I would say that is just about right: and that makes `The Sting' one of my highest voted US films of all time.",The Sting

This movie is the best crime movie spoof because in real mob movies the directors make their mob films look so realistic, but with this film makes it look like a joke of which to me is hilarious. Newman and Redford do magnificent here, along with Robert Shaw (in his best performance since Jaws) as the man that Gondorff tries to compete with in a few poker games, but cheats and gets away with it as a joke but that really gets on Shaw's nerves and we all laugh about it.

It turns out this one here is a bit silly in concept, but as a film why not - the only problem is as much as the movie demands a great deal of indulgence from the viewer, it doesn't in turn offer, well, all that much fun. You can do with a couple of inaccuracies and play the role wearing a thick lens for a film's time, but this here is two hours and ten minutes, it just goes on and on and there isn't enough to cover that length.Now some parts are funny, maybe a couple (the painter trick in the Western Union office with the guy randomly giving the secretary a phone message was good), Redford and Newman do well, Shaw is very good as the trustless perpetually wary villain... but it's just too long, oddly paced and neither great fun nor terribly serious, but it's probably one of the first films that started this trend which gave rise to a great comedy like ""Dirty Rotten Scoundrels"".

Newman and Redford were glamorous stars: they spoke their lines convincingly, but their personalities didn't change. No doubt I haven't seen all their films, but enough to perceive them as somehow always the same. In a sense, type-cast. The British actor, on the other hand, here Robert Shaw, disappears into his role, in the tradition of innumerable actors of the same school: Alec Guinness, Peter Sellers, Anthony Hopkins, the incomparable Gary Oldman. Shaw was one of the best, as the variety of his many roles bears witness. Unforgettable as Henry VIII in A Man for All Seasons, as Aston in The Caretaker.

110,roghache,Plot kinks in 1930's Chicago con tale make a genuine entertainer,10,8 May 2006,"What a fabulous and unique movie! It's many people's favorite and certainly ranks high on my list. The film has old fashioned title cards which divide the intricately woven story into three parts, introducing the Set Up, the Hook, and the Sting. The twists, turns, and traps of the plot are amazing. After several viewings, I still haven't caught nearly all the red herrings. This is definitely a movie you can't see just once if you want to keep track of just who's conning who.The story revolves around two unforgettable Chicago con men from the 1930's era...the more mature & experienced pro, Henry Gondorff, and the young up & coming reprobate, Johnny Hooker. When their mutual friend, Luther Coleman, is murdered, there is little hope of conventional justice due to rampant police corruption. This charismatic pair of 'grifters' thus sets forth to execute their own form of justice by devising an elaborate (and constantly befuddling) plan designed to exact revenge on the mob boss, Doyle Lonnegan, responsible for Luther's death. Their intricate scam is intended to extract $500,000 out of this wealthy and professional racketeer. Yes, they are indeed criminals, but such endearing ones and their cause is just! I will proceed no further, not wishing to let the cat out of the bag. (And there are a lot of cats in any number of bags!)The cast is stellar, particularly the role of the two con men, who earlier starred together in Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid. Here the charming Paul Newman plays the more seasoned Gondorff, with the handsome Robert Redford cast as the relative newcomer, Hooker. Once again the two have amazing chemistry together, revealing sort of a father & son or older & younger brother type relationship. Robert Shaw pulls off a compelling performance as Lonnegan, the glowering villain of the piece and target of this pair's con. Other supporting cast include Charles Durning and Robert Lee Jones as Luther.Featured are plenty of the settings and scenes you'd expect, given the theme and its era. There are gambling dens, bookie shops, brothels, and a poker game on a train. Even for those (such as myself) who are unfamiliar with the rules, this particular card game between Gondorff and Lonnegan is engrossing with all the verbal interplay and trickery.The 1930's setting is wonderful...the clothes, the atmosphere, and especially the music. Of course the entire ragtime soundtrack is legendary, and accompanies both the film's mood and action perfectly. I note complaints that Scott Joplin piano rags were passe for this era, that the music to be authentic should have been swing. Perhaps (I'm no expert), but I'd call it artistic license. Most every child taking piano lessons can't wait to master everyone's perky favorite, The Entertainer. My own personal favourite is the melancholy Solace, wonderfully suited musical scoring to the mood of the accompanying scene. However, most of the tunes are lively in keeping with what is generally a light hearted, cheerful, and upbeat tale.This film has incredible music, frequent humour, a magnificent supporting cast, and an unbelievably riveting & surprising plot. However, it's the extraordinary and magnetic Newman / Redford partnership as the confidence tricksters that truly makes this film an immortal classic. The Sting is simply an incredibly entertaining caper and a unique legend that no other tale of its genre is likely to equal.",The Sting

114,steiner-sam,This is almost a perfect film,10,8 October 2021,"It's set in Joliet and Chicago, Illinois, in 1936. It's inspired by the 1940 book by David Maurer, ""The big con: the story of the confidence man."" It's a light-hearted story of two con men seeking revenge on a gangster who killed their friend.Johnny Hooker (Robert Redford) is a young, impetuous con man in Joliet, Illinois. He inadvertently pulls a con with his friend, Luther Coleman (Robert Earl Jones), on a bagman for Doyle Lonnegan (Robert Shaw). Lonnegan is a big-time New York gangster who tries to kill Hooker and succeeds in killing Coleman for robbing him of $10,000. Hooker escapes to Chicago but still has a corrupt police lieutenant, William Snyder (Charles Dunning), after him.Henry Gondorff (Paul Newman) is a seeming has-been confidence man who has pulled many ""big cons"" in his life but now is a down-and-out alcoholic working for Billie (Eileen Brennan), who runs a carousel in downtown Chicago. However, Gondorff is convinced by Hooker's desire for revenge, and they set up a massive con against Lonnegan in a manner that leaves them unharmed even after Lonnegan knows he's been taken.Some complications arise, which require further cons within cons, but the story moves briskly along, accompanied by Scott Joplin's ragtime music, especially ""The Entertainer.""For me, this is almost a perfect film. The screenplay, the acting, the pacing of the story, the music, and the 1930s setting are all top drawer. This is another Redford/Newman ""buddy"" story that reflects their excellent chemistry, but the secondary players also work very well. I have nothing bad to say about this film, and I still watch it at least once a year. It always leaves me with a happy feeling.",The Sting
115,h-28658,A classic indeed,8,27 April 2020,"After all this years is still fresh. Fast pacing and with a very good story, it is easy to understand why ""The Sting"" is considered a paragon within con-artist movies.

116,goya-4,Redford and Newman play a perfect game,10,20 September 2000,"Reunited with George Roy Hill, who they made Butch Cassiday with in 1968, Paul Newman and Robert Redford return to the screen in the wonderful classic about two confidence men who try to pull the perfect con..that's all of the plot I am going to tell you because half of the excitement is watching this movie play itself out.. an outstanding cast and production with its costume design and cinematography.. won seven academy awards including best picture on a scale of one to ten...10",The Sting
117,jackasstrange,A enjoyable film from the earlier 70s,7,6 November 2013,"The Sting is not a flawless film, very quite the opposite actually,but still being a enjoyable one. Paul Newman as Henry brings a performance that is nothing less than excellent, Redford did a good job as well, not so good as Newman though, but still pretty good. The story itself, it's not that bad...sure, the dialogues seems to be way too uninteresting and a bit pointless, because sometimes it could easily be skipped, but that's OK. A few twists as well are not so well made. The edition, yes, one of the highest points in this film. It's really surprising for me personally to find a film so well edited in the earlier 70s. From all the films which i saw done in this time, all the greats had the edition as a very strong point. It's not coincidence,for sure.The Score is very lighthearted with a lot of comedic tons. It fits perfectly in the film, because despite a few deaths which en- darken a bit the atmosphere, the sting is a very 'UP' film overall. So,i don't know if it will add anything to your life,but if you watch it,you'll wont waste your time either. 7.5/10P.S: Highlight to the scene where Harry(Newman) and Doyle(Shaw) are playing cards. A truly remarkable moment in this film.",The Sting
118,zeekwunlau,True true false,8,30 April 2020,"The film is a movie with a strong black comedy style. It describes the fraudulent activities of the United States during the Great Depression in the 1930s with a nostalgic approach. The film has always attracted the attention of the audience with playful and whimsical dialogues and serial scam stories. The two actors who are all dramas (Paul Newman, Robert Redford) cooperate with the tacit understanding, and add ""cold noodles"". Robert Shaw's wonderful play, the film won praise from many film critics.
The fun and coolness revealed in the film and the seriousness hidden in it are lacking in many films. Director George Roy Hill did not make the simple plot complex and tricky, but used a one-line narrative to simplify the complex plot. Its superb visual processing skills, excellent storytelling ability and interesting and attractive dialogues promote the development of the whole plot. There is no flashy and lively fight in the film, just relying on the dialogue between the two men makes the whole film full of fun. The clever layout and plot setting make the whole movie watching process not only fun, but also always maintain a sense of tension.
In the opponent play between Paul Newman and Robert Redford, the wonderful chemical reaction is difficult to describe in words, especially Paul Newman 's unmarked perfect acting in the film has been played to the fullest, leaving a record in the history of the film. The image of ""old rivers and lakes"" worth remembering has made many viewers unforgettable.
The film heavily uses the works of black American musician Scott Joblin to render and set off the atmosphere. This mix of folk songs, western music and the African rhythm of the rhythm of the African continent runs through the film, and it is extremely compatible with the film's optimistic sense of humor, while also reawakening the public's passion for this black music.",The Sting
119,jldmp1,The Royal Scam,8,8 June 2006,"All good movies know how to lead the viewer somewhere; the very act of telling the story (separate from the content) is engaging or seductive. In contrast, a poor movie is simply 'there' -- just a collection of plot points, the viewer doesn't fall for the storytelling.You've got to love the self-reference here...the movie is about a con within a con, and the entire movie IS the ""big con"" that Redford describes (he's 'always wanted to run one'); only, the viewer is the 'mark', and 'he can't know he's been taken'.There are three specific scenes where we get played; the initial three-grifter scam, the poker game, and the 'sting'. The first two are laid out in an obvious manner, with the mechanics completely exposed, so as to set us up. The Bureau's 'sting' knocks us down, by having us believe the machinations were ruined. Clever noir construction...the best recent successor to this (in construction, if not in the subject)is probably ""The Usual Suspects"".Cinematically, the story is unfolded by turning pages of the 'book'; smart use of self-awareness. After ""The Hustler"", Newman could play this in his sleep...he winks at us in recognition of his power to make this fun.Major tracts of this became templates for parts of ""Rain Man"" and ""Dark City"".",The Sting
120,eddax,I'd have liked more cheekiness and irreverence,8,18 February 2010,"I was quite surprised to find myself preferring Ocean's Eleven (the remake), considering how much I love the classics. Both are intricate conmen movies with two alpha males leading a crew of (mostly) men, but while Eleven is cheerfully and humorously irreverent, the Sting avoids having too much tongue-in-cheekiness despite some tantalizing tastes of it. What a pity, since Paul Newman and Robert Redford were the original George Clooney and Brad Pitt, all of them masculine, cocky, sexy men with that devilish glints in their eyes.Despite the less engaging patter, watching the two men in action would've made the movie sufficiently entertaining, but coupled with the production values, it becomes a good movie (though not the great movie most people think it is). The technical team really captured the 1930s (as far I know, from watching the movies from then), from the art direction to the costumes, and even the directorial choices invoke the retro feel, like the slight haziness in the camera-work and the changing of scenes by wiping. Visually, this movie is more impressive than Eleven, but the latter was the more fun watch for me.",The Sting

122,Silverzero,"30's style jazzy heist caper, perfectly balances charm and style.",10,6 June 2003,"Films are generally considered classics if they excel to a great level on a certain point (acting, special effects, script, etc). But the beauty about `The Sting' is that it gets a perfect (not necessarily outstanding) mark on all levels. The movie perfectly balances humour, enjoyment, style and charm with a subtle hint of gloss to create an all round brilliant movie. The film is done in a slick old fashion with a bright, exuberant feel.
The majority of `The Sting' is set in 30's Chicago, not so much the hotbed of jazz, sex and murder in the current blockbuster hit. The image of Chicago is clearly a studio set with cardboard walls, but this adds to the old fashioned feel and the costumes, mannerisms, make-up etc. perfectly resemble the period in question. Above all else, `The Sting' is a sometimes vain, happy-go-lucky comedy. The heavier topics of murder and revenge don't get a chance to settle in, which is a good thing because the movie is best when it doesn't take itself to seriously. The soundtrack couldn't be better either. Scott Joplin's `The Entertainer' fits in with the environment that we are presented with. The acting is quite good, in particular from Paul Newman and Robert Redford in the lead roles. They make a perfect duo and the chemistry between the two always feels natural. Redford's more energetic performance is slightly better than Newman's sedated veteran con-man part. Generally good support from Robert Shaw as the stereotypical bad guy, Eileen Brennan and Charles Durning. The film is given the appropriate light touch so that even the most serious moments have that nostalgic glow to them. Another thing I like was the episodic division in the movie, so as each part is divided into chapters. `The Sting' is a simple but perfect movie, like a cross between `Paper Moon' and `Chicago' with the extra-added dose of glibness. Truly a classic if there ever was one. My IMDb rating: 8.3/10.",The Sting

The business of a swindler is not a lucrative business. The cost of any such lucrative business is enormous, even as it was Luther's life. Hook would certainly have died without Henry Conf's teachings, which is the biggest difference between a stable (great) liar, who minimizes his own damage, and a rogue, who lacks the thought to do it. Perhaps that is what Luther meant in his last words. In the end, life is all about positive thinking.",The Sting

The acting is one thing to put all your love into, but the storyline is something more to be impressed about. It comes with so many surprises that by the end you begin to query if the storyline is as simple as it is made out to be. It's also full of enough humour to take the edge off what would be an over serious film. The Sting is a feel good film, by the end, but also one that questions mans greed and the way people end up getting what they want.

The music is great. The plot will keep you on your seat from start to end. The Sting keeps you rooting for the underdogs throughout. This film is one of the rare gems that will be fun for young and middle and old folks alike.

The return of the Dynamic Duo, Paul Newman and Robert Redford --after their spectacular success with Butch Cassidy & the Sundance Kid was highly anticipated in 1973. They again teamed up with director George Roy Hill --and again--produced the goods. Hills passion for having no ""fat"" in his movies is very much in evidence. The pace is fast , and the viewer is expected to have a reasonable I.Q. and be able to watch and LISTEN. The Sting is often called ""complex""......I completely disagree with that.

130,jeremy3,One of the best of the best!,10,15 July 2007,"I have probably about 25-30 films that I consider my best, and this is one of them. I first watched The Sting as a little kid when it came out. Since then I have seen it several times. I usually am hesitant to watch a movie that I have seen so many times, but I popped in the video a few days ago. I am telling you, the movie never gets old. It is entertaining throughout the whole movie. Why is this movie so great? Number one - the soundtrack. I had heard that Joplin's rags were played much slower back in the day than in the movie. It is also odd that music written about 1900 would fit into a movie about the 1930s. However, the music fits in so well and makes the movie flow so well with it. Secondly, the acting. Robert Redford is a bit overrated as an actor, but this is by far his best role. He really shined like he has never shined before and since. Shaw and Newman were brilliant. I liked all the supporting actors and actresses, too. Thirdly, the plot was just so cohesive and fun. Everything was worked out to the minutest detail to entertain. Lastly, I think that the costuming in the movie has never been before or since matched. Newman and Redford were so well clad in their roles. This movie you can see dozens of times and still feel like you've seen it for the first time. It is a really special movie.",The Sting
131,higherall7,Academy of the Con,9,17 March 2016,"This is an elegant film that depends for its gravitas on the death of a fictional African American confidence artist, played by Robert Earl Jones, and the haunting music of a real life great African American musical composer, known as Scott Joplin, who died of venereal disease after his frequent patronage of various bordellos. Now that we have that out of the way, let the games begin!This is a fascinating film that many people love; especially those who like to imagine that they are smart or 'with it', but while I have always admired the convolutions and revelations of the plot, I have mixed feelings for people who pride themselves on being able to take advantage of others. I have an even lower regard for people who hand out assignments for murder to hired henchmen. But there is something about the pathos of this film set in the seething and yet sunny corruption of 1930s Chicago that makes you root for this group of what could be largely out of work actors as underdogs. They are up against Doyle Lonegan, a fourteen carat career criminal, ably played with undeniable menace by Robert Shaw, after one of their rookie confidence artists unknowingly crosses paths with a real life courier for the Lonegan mob.This film puts you in the position of Jake Gittes in CHINATOWN. As the lead villain played by John Huston cheerfully told Jack Nicholson, ""- you may think you know what's going on, but you don't -"". THE STING isn't as dark and tragic as CHINATOWN, but it definitely has its own somewhat comic layers of complexity to it. The first time I saw it, I felt as conned as every one else in the audience, even though the film kept gently suggesting with its Saturday Evening Post inspired inter-title cards, '- here it comes, here it comes -' and in a faux scholarly way prepares to complete your education regarding the confidence game and the nature of THE STING.This film has all the reticulation of a Sherlock Holmes adventure, but is just as much or more about deception and permanent concealment, as it is about placing trust in the carefully schooled perception of a trained expert piecing all the clues together towards a final revelation. This inversion of restoring the moral order would later be made homage to in films like HOUSE OF GAMES and PULP FICTION, but of course, hearkens back to HUCKLEBERRY FINN and other tales where things are not all that they appear to be on the surface. Therefore, my date and I came out of the theater with wry smiles and a more than satisfactory entertainment experience, wondering to ourselves what was this sleight of hand involving mobsters and grifters really all about?Paul Newman as Henry Gondorff, presents an admirable portrait of a master grifter who has been around and can offer mentorship to the up and coming Johnny Hooker as played by Robert Redford. This teacher - student relationship was very satisfying to me, and reminded me of some of the more perplexing relationships I experienced with my own instructors at Cass Tech. Everyone wants to be placed in the hands of an expert or sit at the feet of a master of his or her craft, and this is a thread that runs throughout the course of the narrative. People may tend to neglect the fact that one of the reasons Luther Coleman sends Johnny Hooker to work with Henry Gondorff in the first place is so that he will not perpetuate the shortcomings of his early experiences as a grifter.I have mentioned a few of the main characters, but this is the first time I found myself listing nearly the complete cast in my notes, because this really is an ensemble effort pulled off to brilliant effect. The film leaves you on a lighthearted note, but from the beginning around its contours is the darkness of the death of yet another black man whose life was lived under the mantle of American Criminality on a grand scale, underscored by the melancholy strains of a master pianist and musician whose genius was somewhat stifled beneath whorehouse sheets, but remains with us still. There is an interesting interplay of Life and Death, Good and Evil here, but it would appear that according to Henry Gondorff, the clever and resourceful best know how to play both sides of the street.",The Sting
132,brefane,Not Stung,2,4 May 2013,"Like Chariots of Fire, The Sting is an undeserving Best Picture winner that owes it's enormous success to its score. In this case, Scott Joplin adapted by Marvin Hamlisch. Inspired by the success of Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid (1969)which also featured a popular, Oscar-winning theme, The Sting reunites the director and the 2 stars with diminishing results. Butch Cassidy was diverting, had some charm, and was nice to look at, but The Sting is cloying, claustrophobic, and its charm calculated, and at 129 minutes it seems interminable because nothing in this film about an elaborate con involving good-hearted crooks seems to matter. As for movies dealing with cons, I prefer A Big Hand for a Little Lady, Trick Baby, House of Games, Felini's Il Bidone (""The Swindlers"") and even Harry in Your Pocket which was released in 1973 the same year The Sting was named Best Picture while Badlands, Sleeper, Payday, The Homecoming, The Long Goodbye, Mean Streets, Paper Moon, The Last Detail and Serpico were not even nominated for Best Picture",The Sting
133,krational66,Liar has a lot of flavor.,7,26 April 2020,"All in all, it's a relaxing film. Because the ending of the story is so obvious, it is like reading a novel, some novels have already guessed the ending halfway through. But that metaphor doesn't stop it from being a good movie. At least it looks good and looks good.
This is a film about the friendship, or possibly may be more suitable for a bit, and then there's the elder and the young man's story, in other words is mature and impulse dialogue, as well as about wealth, should be the irony of wealth - by means of cheat never moral man hands to get the money - so obviously both sides.As Luther put it, ""it's the untalented cheater who makes the big bet.""The survival of the swindler is also a technique. The business of swindlers is not a highly profitable business, the cost is huge, any so-called highly profitable business costs are huge, even with Luther on the same life. Hook would have lost his life without the guidance of Henry constable, which is the biggest difference between a stable con man and a punk con man -- the former keeps his damage to a minimum, while the latter simply lacks the thinking. Perhaps that was what Luther meant in a passage before he died. After all, life also needs positive thinking.The film is divided into seven rings: a bait trap under the bait trick wager horse attack excitingThe story is smooth, watchable and enjoyable.Impulse is the devilAn impulse begins with folly and ends with regret. The voiceover on the first layer of the movie is supposed to have this in it, too. Henry constable's success, hook learned to think carefully to get rid of the impulse in his body, and longan because of losing money on the train, then impulse, of course, may also be the reason for the character, resulting in the final eat a big loss, dull loss.Clever deception requires careful planning, excellent acting, and the ability to handle emergencies. Of these three, hooker's greatest lack is the first, which is especially important, especially when it's a trick that lasts a long time, rather than the street-level trickery of the beginning. I remember when the cheater emperor Henry confe and his three partners were discussing where to start the con game, and I was thinking, this is really... It's a technical job.The details are handled well. For example, there is the technique of the big fat man knocking on the door when snyder goes to the liar's tavern to find hooker. This detail, I think, can well illustrate the vigilance and thoughtfulness that a liar should have.Crooks are a business, hook said. I like that.Henry conf: it was worth it, wasn't it?They all said: what a blast!Cheaters seem to have another golden rule: clothes make the man.Psychological warfare, it should be said that this film teaches us psychology.

It's a masterpiece, a showcase of fine acting, fine direction and a masterclass in film-making. The 70's was rather over-burdened with films set in the 20's and 30's, and I didn't bother going to see 'The Sting', telling myself it was 'just another sepia-toned wise-cracking film'. How wrong I was, as I found out when I saw the film on TV many years later. The ingenuity of the setup, the audacity of the wiles employed to put each part in place for the final sting, and the gloss and panache of its execution are almost enough to make one gasp in admiration. I've had the restored version on DVD for a few months now, and I'm trying to wait for the perfect time to settle down with my wife - who also loves the film - and spend two hours in film-based bliss. EDIT: OK, we chose last night to watch the DVD and we were not disappointed - this film gets better every time you see it. Just a few more comments from me, and then i'm off to watch the bonus 'making of'. My first comment concerns the fantastic 'night before the big sting' scene, in which Hooker desperately seeks companionship with the girl at the drugstore. It's a long night, nerves are on edge and no-one sleeps. It's done with no dialogue and very little sound except for the low-key music and a carefully handled feeling of the approaching dawn. It gives me shivers just thinking of it, what superb direction. Then of course the end.

No heavy, needless violence, no sex, no really bad language, but superb acting & wonderful directing. Why do modern movies think it so necessary to have all of the former but very little of the latter!The lavish 30s production is spot on, making you feel as if you're part of the era. The acting between Newman, Redford and Shaw sparkles like a polished diamond - especially the poker game scene. Shaw plays one of his best performances on a par with From Russia with Love and Jaws. He has those wonderful deeply set eyes that will turn your soul to ice if you try and cross him.But its the chemistry between N&R that really makes the film so welcoming. There are no egos hogging the screen here unlike with some so-called big stars who share the billing with other so-called stars.Redford has that playful innocence about him, the loveable urchin who needs a hug and some worldly advice. While Newman plays the relatively elder statesman with authority but with that radiant little grin that he is blessed with.Together they seem to reprise and update their Butch & Sundance roles but with a tad more fluidity this time. They don't have to try too hard to impress us unlike their first film together. There isn't a single flaw in this movie. I've tried to find one but failed, although I suppose if I really, really, really wanted to be picky I would say it was a bit too stagey. Not enough exterior scenes to give the film some breadth and a chance to smell the air.But I'm quibbling. The Sting stung me years ago and I've been infected ever since!*****/*****",The Sting
136,HelloTexas11,a real crowd-pleaser,8,25 December 2007,"'The Sting' features the most likable bunch of thieves, scam-artists, and con-men you've ever seen in your life. There's not one of them that you wouldn't want to sit down and play a game of poker with, even if they stole your pants off. Even the baddest of the bad guys, Robert Shaw's Doyle Lonnegan, is likable, because he's such a great foil for the two most likable rogues, Paul Newman's Henry Gondorff and Robert Redford's Johnny Hooker. If this were a serious movie about confidence men in the 1930's and the 'sting' they pull off, that likability factor would be a fatal drawback, but it's not, so it isn't. No, 'The Sting' might well be considered the ultimate crowd-pleasing flick, consistently hitting all the right buttons for a mass audience. Everything, right down to the music, or maybe even especially the music, is just right. Scott Joplin's piano rags are masterfully adapted for the film by Marvin Hamlisch; you'll be humming them and hearing them in your head for weeks after watching. In fact, 'The Sting' is almost like a period musical without singers or dancing. It's too brightly lit, too cozy and comfortable with itself, too (I'm trying desperately not to say 'likable' again) in love with its characters to achieve any really threatening moments, even when one suspects that it wants to. There are surprises here and there, but against this feel-good backdrop, even the most potentially shocking ones go down easily, like cotton candy. The ingeniously whimsical plot takes us on Gondorff and Hooker's journey to swindle Lonnegan, a big-time crime boss, out of half a million dollars. The 'big con' is set up elaborately and methodically over the course of the film; that is what accounts for most of the enjoyment we get from it. Grifters are recruited, a fake gambling hall is established, false identities are created, all for the purpose of making Lonnegan believe he can win big by putting up a half-million dollar bet in Gondorff's place. Along the way, there are many subplots, each providing background or motivation for certain characters (mainly Hooker) and in the end, these threads are all neatly tied up in a final scene that is funny and satisfying and which usually results in the film audience breaking into spontaneous applause. None of the performances, with the exception of Robert Shaw's, is particularly outstanding. Newman and Redford have a comedic chemistry that is undeniable, as they proved in 'Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid,' but this isn't really a showcase for either's acting versatility compared to other films they've made. The rest of the cast is a gallery of character actors and it's nice to see them all playing such lovable crooks. I daresay 'The Sting' was a career high point for at least a dozen of them. When the film first came out, it grossed nearly $160 million and it seemed damn near everyone in the country had seen it and loved it. Not many films can make that claim, and so I will say it for the record now: 'The Sting' is the most likable movie ever made.",The Sting
137,son_of_cheese_messiah,Entertaining but sanitised and contrived,6,4 May 2012,"Viewed as pure entertainment, this is a diverting way to spend a couple of hours. The objective is to turn the brain off and not think too deeply about the shallow fare before you. However when you do think, some troubling aspects come to mind.This is the 1930s viewed through rose tinted spectacles. Typically Hollywood idealised 'grifters' (why does Hollywood always side with thieves and prostitutes?) inhabit a multicultural utopia. There is no racial tension between the characters and no sign of the segregation which was in force in much of the US at the time. The grifters, in reality were hardened conmen who would happily steal from a poor box, are here good natured folks.We see them target a random victim at the start. It does not matter to them whether he was a charity worker taking money to deposit at the bank, they indiscriminately rob from him. It is only by chance that he turns out to be a bad guy and therefore, retrospectively, seen as an acceptable target.This might be OK if they were motivated by poverty, but the actual motivation is sheer greed and laziness. Redford immediately wastes his share -about a year's wages in the 1930s- gambling in one night. Yet we are supposed to sympathize with him? The murder of his black partner is portrayed as a tragedy, with the usual Hollywood ratcheting up of emotion by having this be his final job before retirement. However, I can only have limited sympathy with a man who has made his livelihood by stealing from others.We are supposed to want one group of criminals, led by Newman, steal from another, Shaw? Hollywood achieves this by having us recognize that Redford and Newman are the 'good guys' despite their criminal ways. And to aid this, In this world, in a Hollywood moral inversion, the sole representative of law and order is a violent and corrupt cop.The plot is very contrived and convoluted. In particular the addition of the female assassin seems an unnecessary addition. Redford's seduction of her is a rather silly and unconvincing detour. And she is unceremoniously gunned down by one of Newman's henchmen? Surely that means that Newman is a murderer too, no better than the villain Shaw?",The Sting
138,kyle-cruse,One of the best ever made,10,19 August 2008,"I was blown away by ""The Sting."" I'm a fan of caper films such as the ""Ocean's Eleven"" or ""National Treasure"" movies, and this is no exception (in fact, this is probably the best caper film I've seen). I didn't think Robert Redford and Paul Newman would be able to top ""Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid,"" their previous film together, but they totally did. It's a great plot that ends up ""stinging"" not only the characters but the audience as well (see it to find out what I mean). It's a great balance between comedy and drama; it can be quite dramatic, but when it's funny, it's very funny. The plot involves Newman and Redford taking revenge on a gangster who killed one of their men. It's a complex, fun-filled story that entertains and mesmerizes. Some people are shot with guns, but nothing in the film is too difficult for the average person to watch, in my opinion. Not only are Newman and Redford excellent, but so is the supporting cast, including Robert Shaw, Harold Gould, and Charles Durning. The film won Best Picture of 1973, which was deserved. The film is just excellent. One of my personal favorites.**** out of ****",The Sting
139,JaydoDre,Cute movie,7,25 February 2015,"It is really weird how the starting credits show the characters as they appear in scenes from the movie. That is something you see at the start of a show but looks weird in a movie. Like a collage of not-spoilers. AnywayParts of this movie can be hard to understand and that is largely due to the dialogue. For one, a number of characters, especially the main villain, speak with an accent that takes a moment to understand. The other reason is the words used. Characters use fancy gangster language, like ""fold the con"" and contemporary terms like ""Faro"" (a card game apparently). A combination of this cool language and quick mumbled speech means that it is hard to understand anyone, sometimes with the frequency of every sentence in a scene. Some dialogue is happening in the background. Some of it does not get a set-up and none of it comes with any explanation for the viewer. All of this makes the movie sound natural and smart, but it also results in loss of meaning. Where the movie really shines is when it comes to its performances. The two main leads, Robert Redford and Paul Newman are really charming. Possibly the archetype of a charming bandit. The villain, played by Robert Shaw, though he acts well, is a weak character. He looks intelligent, but he eats up everything the other con artists feed him. In general the story breaks down if you think too much about it. For example, without spoiling anything, ask yourself after watching this movie: why would a trained assassin waste several days pretending to be someone else just to kill an unarmed person when there were countless opportunities to do so, and then you will find an answer: for the sake of an exciting twist.Also, where did all these conmen find all the money they needed for the big job? The two main characters especially are shown to be down on their luck and the con involves an army of people, rented spaces and investments. It feels like this movie fooled many people into believing that it is smarter than it actually is.Having said that, it is really charming and well-acted.",The Sting
140,BadWebDiver,Brilliant mix of intrigue and comedy,10,9 June 2002,"This is one of the best written and well-paced films ever.  It has a great mix of pacing, characterization, plot twists and comedy.  With stand-out performances by Paul Newman and Robert Redford as the two affable leads, and Robert Shaw as the mark for the con, this is a delight to sit through.  From the first scam I think most viewers would be totally hooked in the story.And it also deserves a lot of credit for re-popularizing Scott Joplin music, like ""The Entertainer"" - which can only be a good thing.  About the only films I can think of to come even close to the style of this classic are THE ITALIAN JOB, and the recent film THE SCORE - but this is still the grand-daddy of all comic heist capers.",The Sting

Excellent direction, screenplay, editing, setting, costume and score. The plot revolves around two con men who have been out of the game for awhile aside from a few short- cons. They team up again with several of their grifter cohorts to pull off the long- con. Their mark is a rich crook known to con and cheat people himself. On their tale is a relentless detective. This is where the fun begins. Now the two must outwit the law and a man of their own kind. The plot is clever, witty, has twists and a fantastic ending. It remains the greatest buddy con movie ever made and has influenced several con films to follow. It's the last time these three artists worked together and the last time Redford and Newman performed on screen together. That is the only disappointment one could find with this film. It remains a classic and one of the very best in it's genre.",The Sting
142,Gideon24,Terrific entertainment with charismatic stars and a riveting story.,8,14 March 2016,"The Sting was the feel-good hit film of 1973 that won the Oscar for Best Picture of the year and documented that the chemistry Paul Newman and Robert Redford created in Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid wasn't a fluke.Set in Chicago in the 1930's, Redford plays Johnny Hooker, a second rate con man who finds out that a criminal banker named Doyle Lonnegan (Robert Shaw) was indirectly responsible for the death of his long time partner. Determined to avenge his partner's death, Hooker enlists the aid of veteran con man Henry Gondorff (Newman), who has his own issues with Lonnegan and, together, they set up an elaborate con, a ""sting"" if you will, to get Lonnegan where he lives...in his wallet.One of the strongest aspects of this film is the Oscar winning screenplay by David S. Ward, who has chosen to let this story unfold very slowly and with serious attention to details in story execution. This is one of those stories that if you miss five minutes of the movie, you won't have a clue what's going on, so have that pause button poised if you're interrupted. I have always felt that this was the sign of a really great screenplay, that every single detail presented on screen is germane to the story.George Roy Hill's meticulous direction and the chemistry between Redford and Newman are the other things that make this film work. Hill has mounted an elaborate story here with striking attention to period detail and to serving the story. Newman and Redford are a well-oiled machine here. Redford actually received his only Oscar nomination for Best Actor for his work here, which I think was also in recognition of his other big performance the same year in The Way We Were. There is also a first rate supporting cast including Charles Durning, Ray Walston, Eileen Brennan, Harold Gould, Dana Elcar, and Dimitra Arliss.Hill won his only Best Director Oscar for his work here, Edith Head won her fourth and final Oscar for her costumes, and Marvin Hamlisch's musical scoring also won, based on the music of ragtime icon Scott Joplin and believe me, after seeing this movie, you will be humming ""The Entertainer"".

146,sandnair87,The Con is On in this Sensational Heist Thriller!,9,29 March 2015,"Viewing The Sting is cinematic pleasure at its purest - a true filmmaking classic that works as much as wholesome entertainment as it does as a story of revenge.Set in the Depression-era Chicago, Henry Gondorff (Paul Newman) is a resourceful old pro who has quite a criminal run behind him but now he's just holed up, semi-retired from crime and slowly drinking himself to death. Enter young Johnny Hooker (Robert Redford), a small-time grifter who wants revenge on big-shot racketeer Doyle Lonnegan (Robert Shaw), who ordered the murder of Hooker's partner. An intricate scheme (called the 'big con') is devised by our two con artists to fleece Lonnegan. First, the quarry is hooked in a wonderfully testy poker-playing session which becomes a cheating contest with Gondorff pretending to be a drunken easy mark. The baiting continues. A fake off-track betting parlor is hastily constructed and, with the help of some clever impersonations by the con men involved in the scheme, the victim is slowly convinced that here is a place where he can make easy money. The victim is now set up for the kill. Then it comes, the long-awaited moment of ""the sting,"" when the mark is parted from his money; and with that also comes the realization that if anyone has been conned it's the viewer, not that this con game hasn't been fun while it lasted.In the Sting, con games are a way of life. Everyone is out for what he or she can get. And it is that kind of cynicism which pervades the movie. The story is so well-told, guided by the sure hand of George Roy Hill, that it turns into a wholly engaging piece of movie-going candy. The Sting boasts a superbly well-written screenplay, ripe with perfectly constructed dialogue and a plot line riddled with suspense along with a clever interweaving of key sub- plots. But the real pleasure comes from the striking chemistry between Newman and Redford. With their compelling, effortless charm, they have the audience eating out of their hands without even trying. The casting of Shaw is a major coup: his taciturn menace commands attention even when he is simply part of a master shot - a less-imposing presence would have negated the impact of the story. With his icy, self-possession, he is just the kind of man one would like to see brought down.With a parade of eccentric characters, well-developed sinister figures, and clever exchanges of dialogue, The Sting isn't your typical sensationalistic Hollywood potboiler. So, sit down, turn off the lights and prepare for 2 hours of joyous escapism and boundless charisma!",The Sting

150,movieman-200,The Con Is On Us - Universal's latest reincarnation of The Sting still lacks in Image Quality,8,6 September 2005,"George Roy Hill's The Sting (1973) is the ultimate crime-does-pay movie. It reunites Robert Redford and Paul Newman (fresh from Butch Cassidy & The Sundance Kid) as a pair of loose canon con artists. Redford is Johnny Hooker, a reprobate being groomed by slight of hand master, Luther (Robert Earl Jones). Together, the two devise and carry out an elegant con that nets them a tidy bank roll. However, when mob boss Doyle Lonigan (Robert Shaw) learns of their deception, he orders his men to rub out Luther and Johnny. Hooker is shaken down by crooked  if slightly sympathetic police lieutenant, Will Snyder (Charles Durning). But Luther is killed, sending Johnny on a mission to avenge his mentor by employing one of his old acquaintances, Henry Gondorf (Newman). Henry used to be a man in the chips. Now he's yesterday's news. But is he ready to throw in the towel and become a legitimate and productive member of society just yet? Director Hill peppers the plot in a series of ironic mishaps and implausible twists that somehow never become contrived. The culminating shake down and final con is memorably set to the music of Scott Joplin's ragtime.I'm not sure what Universal means when they advertise a disc as 'digitally remastered with completely restored audio.' Does that suggest that the video is only partially restored? After a dismal initial offering from Universal, which was NOT widescreen  but then even more insultingly repackaged and advertised as a collector's edition  we get a 2-disc Legacy Edition DVD of The Sting. It IS widescreen and thankfully enhanced for 16X9 displays. However, the image quality presented throughout is hardly something to get excited about. As with the previously issued full frame disc, colors remain pasty, slightly faded and generally unnatural looking. Flesh tones are usually too pink or slightly orange  but never appearing as natural. Contrast levels are weak. Blacks are rarely deep or solid. Whites are more bluish or grayish than white. Overall the characteristic of the image is soft. Occasionally we get some nice crisp looking close ups of Newman or Redford in which fine detail on clothing and make up can be observed, but for the most part details become lost in a dull looking image that has little to recommend it. The audio has been remixed to 5.1, DTS and a cleaned up Mono track (as originally presented in theaters). The 5.1 and DTS offer virtually the same listening experience  flat, largely isolated in the center channel and with little to no separation  except in the musical tracks and occasional sound effect. Otherwise, they might as well have been mono.Extras on disc 2 boil down to an extensive documentary on the film's creation, success and longevity, inexplicably divided into three chapters that abruptly end, and are really a reason for Universal to advertise them as three extra features  rather than one giant one. There is NO audio commentary track  a gross oversight for a 70s flick as beloved as this one is. Overall then, The Sting gets recommended as a must have on this time around. But it's not the reference quality collector's piece that it might have been. Oh well, the con is still on.",The Sting
151,Kubris,One Cool Caper,8,5 February 2013,"I was very pleased with myself, having avoided absolutely everything about this Best Picture-winning classic. I have never seen a Paul Newman film before, and was disappointed by Redford as Gatsby. I didn't even know what this film was about. Absolutely nothing. And it made the film that much better.The Sting is about con men performing 'the long con' on a shady banker, as revenge for a former partner. With throwback title cards we are walked through the process, which comes down to an elaborate gambling hoax. It was a bit frustrating to not know what was going on though. Not even the surface-level plan. And for a modern audience, 'straight poker' is a bit alien. Nonetheless, comprehending the plot is the most thinking you'll have to do during The Sting.Don't expect a life-changing moral or social criticism: entertainment is the goal of this slick, 30's set robbery.

155,Don-102,"A Lightweight, Clever Throwback to the Big Cons of the 1930's.",8,24 January 2000,"At first sight, THE STING appears to be nothing more than a television movie.  It is entirely plot-driven with no real stand out characters or personalities.  What makes the film work is excellent production design and a delightfully clever plot filled with many surprises.  The movie is feather-weight emotionally, but the depth of the ""con"" and the way it is fashioned by screenwriter David Ward leaves you with a pleasant experience.This is more Redford's film than Newman's, who reunite with George Roy Hill, director of BUTCH CASSIDY AND THE SUNDANCE KID.  The legendary actors were more flesh and blood in that film, but here, they are merely players who carry the story along.  With lesser actors, THE STING may have been a forgettable piece of work.  Redford does all of the dirty work after Newman's initial ""hook"", but the omniscient presence of Newman, as big-time grifter ""Henry Gondorff"" exists throughout.  A mysterious gloved character, a crooked cop, the FBI, and a seemingly bigger con-man ""Doyle Lonnegan"" (played by the late, great Robert Shaw) are some of the players who are involved in some events that seem to be manipulated by an unseen force.  Is Newman as good as he claims in trying to clean out Shaw?  We'll see.The film is shot simply by Hill.  No tricky angles or contrived camera movements are used.  The action takes place simply in front of us.  The production design by Henry Bumstead and James Payne recreates old-time Chicago through the use of built sets, matte paintings of a smaller sky-line, and some location shots.  It gives the film an almost artificial look which is fitting considering it is a direct homage to the 1930's and the gangster pictures that so dominated that decade.  The story is even furthered by title pages describing ""the set-up, the hook, and the sting"". They are turned like pages in a book, adding a drop of elegance to a crooked world.  An iris is even employed in some scenes.THE STING is definitely lightweight entertainment.  It does not provoke much thought or insight into what is happening on screen.  Fun is the word for this amusing little film that depicts a masterful plan for a big steal which would be impossible to pull off today.  Look out for Ray Walston in a hilarious role announcing horse races and their results as they are ""happening"" just after receiving word of the ""real"" race results from a back room in the betting house.

But laid along side ""The Conversation"" ""Lenny"" ""The Godfather PII"" ""Chinatown"" and others, it's pretty slim pickings.

And yet, despite its freshness, it is an undisputed classic that virtually everyone has seen (or at least has heard of), and which has inspired numerous subsequent films.""The Sting"" is about the story of two con artists, Johnny Hooker (Redford) and Henry Gondorff (Newman) who team together to rip off a mafia boss, Lonnegan (Shaw); Hooker wants to do the heist mainly for revenge, since Lonnegan has killed a friend of his, while Gondorff goes for the cash. Despite their differences, the two make a perfect duo; they quickly devise a plan, and together with some accomplices they prepare a brilliant trap for Lonnegan. Of course, things are not as easy as they would want to...The pace is fast, while the plot is clever and offers plausible twists. The direction of George Roy Hill is good, and although one could argue that some elements of it belong to a past era of cinematography (for example, the scene transitions), the ""dated"" feel they produce matches perfectly with the movie style. As I said in the beginning, the movie looks very fresh, and even if it was directed today, it would be a mistake not to follow the same principles Hill did back then.Of course, the two biggest pluses of the film are its two star actors, Redford and Newman: They both deliver a fantastic performance.

What is different about their relationship in this compared to Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid is that Hooker has no experience and is therefore low on knowledge about how to do a long con compared to Newman's Character Gondorff who has more experience at them. Gondorff is Hooker's mentor who shows him the ropes. Hooker starts off cocky, not believing there is anything Gondorff can show him but gains respect for him the more he is around him. Robert Shaw brilliantly plays Lonnegan and the rest of the cast make the film a success- Robert Earl Jones (Luther), Eileen Brennan (Billie), Charles Durning (Snyder), Dana Elcar (FBI Agent Polk), Ray Walston (J.J. Singleton) and Harold Gould (Kid Twist).I think all the elements come together so well- the music, the costumes, the story and look of the movie. There has been a lot of complaints that the music is wrong to use because it wasn't around at the time of the film and yes, it wasn't around at that time but you can't deny it works so well with the action and compliments it so well. It is very interesting to see the type of cons played in those days to how they are played today which are showed in TV series like Hustle.The film is another hit for Newman and Redford which worked so well because as I have said all the strands came together so well thanks not only to the cast but the people behind the camera such as George Roy Hill (Director), David S. Ward (Writer), Edith Head (Costumes), Scott Joplin's music and Robert Surtees (Cinematography).",The Sting
164,jdhb-768-61234,Simply one of the best ever !,10,25 December 2019,"Is there anything that I can add to what has already been written ? Probably not, so I won't say much.I first saw ""The Sting"" in the cinema when it was released in the UK and have seen it many times since. My first impression was that it was a wonderful film, an opinion shared by the cinema audience who broke into howls of delight and spontaneous applause at the card game when Gondorf produces 4 Jacks - I'd never before, or since, experienced anything like it.""The Sting"" benefits from a terrific story, a brilliant script, superb casting and direction and, above all, incredible acting. Oh, and then there's the musical score which brought the ragtime of Scott Joplin back to life after 60 years.In my humble opinion, and others may agree or disagree as they like, ""The Sting"" is one of the greatest films ever made. It has drama and humour, romance and pathos; it brings 1930s depression era America to life in a way few other films do. It's a 10+++ always and forever.",The Sting
165,nzpedals,disappointed,4,16 May 2016,"The DVD cost $1, and had three other Newman movies, none of which feature in any article about Paul, but which I rated higher! (""Winning"" gets a 9), I do remember seeing ""The Sting"" on TV some decades ago, and knew the reputation, and so was so disappointed in seeing such a boring and confusing mess.1. So many men in suits, with hats that have a black band? Who is who, and what are they doing? I couldn't follow.2. The story? Something about the underworld of whatever era it is set in. Shady, unpleasant, devious. And we are supposed to applaud? Na. Does the FBI feature? Or is that part of the multiple deceptions?3. Acting? Nothing special here, yet so many BIG names? Robert Shaw's character is very lightly explained.4. Any really good scenes, with memorable dialogue? Na, but I did like it when Redford hops on a passing street sweeping machine.5. Near-zero for the ladies. Does the female audience approve? 6. Two (at least) unlikely events, ie, the skint Redford blowing $3,000 of stung money, at a time when Marge 'really needs $5' and then much later, the big shot calmly putting $500,000 on a horse race? Na. Does anyone anywhere really believe that? 7. In spite of watching a couple of times, I still don't understand the first little sting with Luther, and an uncredited passing thief?8. The DVD said ""amazing surprise ending"", so I stuck it out just to see what happens. No spoiling, just more unbelievable disappointment. Big phoney shoot-outs do not appeal.",The Sting
166,dalton2,An unforgettable classic,9,16 September 1998,"This is one of the best movies about swindlers I have seen. If we analyze its elements, we find outstanding acting (Newman and Redford are fantastic, as they use to be, not to mention the rest of the cast). We also find a great story perfectly captured on the 'chaptered' screenplay, a wonderful musical choice, very good cinematography and editing... Can we use a single word to resume all of this? Yes, we can use a word to express everything and several more things present in this film: It's a classic. Some scenes are unforgettable. A film to be seen again and again. My rating is 9 out of 10.",The Sting
167,Chuck-149,"Newman, Redford and George Roy Hill did a better job with ""Butch Cassidy"".",6,31 August 1999,"First of all, let's understand each other here.  ""The sting"" is not a bad movie.  On the contrary, it's a good comedy about small-time con-men who hit the big-time.  There are many scenes of pure comedy and the script is intelligent and clever as well. However, I believe that Redford, Newman, and George Roy Hill were, altogether, better in ""Butch Cassidy and the Sundance kid"".  All I'm saying is that I believe it is a little too over-rated.  But anyway, it's a good movie.  Robert Redford and his friend rob a man who they didn't know, works for Doyle Lunnigan (Robert Shaw) who, upon hearing the news, orders his men to have Redford and his friend Luther murdered.  However, Lunnigan's men only get Luther.  After this, Redford goes to Chicago to meet a friend of Luther's, Henry Gondorff (Newman in a hilarious role), who will teach him everything about becoming a great con-man and help him steel from Lunnigan.  Once Redford and Newman meet up, the movie really kicks off with strong performances from an excellent cast and great directing by Hill.  There are many funny scenes and the movie is definitely worth watching.",The Sting
168,tord-1,This is one of the best!,9,16 May 2007,"While many films get a very high rating, when Hollywood's PR guys are afoot, this is a gem that lasts. It is a feel good film, its a thriller, its a perfect Paul Newman and Robert Redford vessel, and more!I saw it some 35 years ago, and I saw it again tonight, and it haven't lost one bit!Can't mention many films that can do that! Nary any, except 'The Sting'!Paul Newman at his top, and Robert Newman better than ever, at least in my book! The rest of the cast are equally good, like the inimitable Robert Shaw, Charles Durning, Ray Walston, and Harold Gould - could you find a better cast?!In short, one of the best films, ever!",The Sting
169,tjsdshpnd,Oceans Series Fans will love The Sting,9,15 October 2009,"An excellent beginning, a shocking ending and infinite twists and turns in between - This can be used to describe this comic con movie by the same team that gave the classic western 'Butch Cassidy And The Sundance Kid'. The protagonist of the movie Johnny Hooker (Redford) is a small time street conman who along with his team intelligently cons people on the road. After a usual day in the office, they find out that they have stolen the money from a big shot crime boss who now is determined to kill all involved in the theft. When the mafia kills one of Hooker's team members and a good friend, he intends to take revenge. Thus along with another big time Conman Henry Gondorff (Newman) and his associates they plan to con the Crime boss himself. The plot is itself very engaging and the director leaves no stone unturned to enrich it. He has divided the movie into different chapters like 'The Hook', 'The Players' etc . A special mention to the BGM which sets the mood of the movie. The piano tune is very catchy and lingers in your mind. This is a Robert Redford movie and he has performed well. Paul Newman is in my list of top 5 actors and he stays there after this one. Robert Shaw also plays the crime boss perfectly.The team of associates of Newman have done a great job as well. In the end, if you liked Con movies such as Oceans 11 etc, then The Sting will not disappoint.Rating : 9/10",The Sting

172,Putzberger,You Can't Watch It Just Once,9,13 February 2006,"""The Sting"" is a puzzle box of a movie, and it takes maybe a viewing and a half to decipher the plot, and probably two full viewings to figure out exactly who conned who(m). The time passes quickly, because it's a breezy, wonderfully paced film with no dead spots, even though a few scenes were obviously left in for their charm -- for example, when Kid Twist interviews the Englishman, the audience learns next to nothing about the characters and the plot doesn't advance, but we do feel lucky to be in on the scam. After you've watched it a few times and can anticipate all the plot machinations, you begin to wonder what director Hill & co are trying to sell you here. The film seems to be making the point that all men are thieves, and you can only trust a man who admits he's a thief. (And yes, I mean ""men,"" the women in this film are peripheral, although they're almost all treated respectfully.) That's a rather cynical message, and it makes ""The Sting"" very much a product of the time it portrays, the Depression, and the time it was made, the Watergate era.All subtext aside, it's a fun film, a brilliantly constructed entertainment. Newman and Redford, the most romantic couple of the early 1970s, are both fine, for the most part relying on their star power rather than their acting abilities. Robert Redford is not a great actor, but he's a great presence and Hill centers some nice images on him -- catching sight of the window where his best friend was just thrown to his death, getting cleaned up for the big con, dawdling in the street as he plots a romantic conquest. Newman is charismatic as ever and seems to be enjoying himself thoroughly, if perhaps at the expense of any menace or vulnerability we should be seeing in his character. As Lonerghan, the villain, Robert Shaw was cast to be somber, grouchy and loathsome, and he doesn't disappoint. Two of the most affecting characters are Luther and Alva Coleman, friends of Redford in Joliet who are very nice, God-fearing people as well as lifelong criminals. Hill could have probably made a smaller, darker movie about the Colemans if he had wanted, but not as many people would have gone to see it.After seeing the movie ten or twenty times, the mechanics of the storytelling can get a bit annoying -- the way Hill conceals the identity of Redford's mob stalker is pretty lame, since he never uses point-of-view camera work at any other time. Plus, the scene where Redford escapes from the cop by hopping the turnstile at a train station, dashing up the stairs and climbing onto the roof above the platform is fun to watch, but a little overdone. Would it really be so hard for Robert Redford to escape from Charles Durning? But these are just a couple of the gimmicks that don't work, better to focus on all the gimmicks that do work (and there are plenty of them). Enjoy.",The Sting
173,Chrimle,The Sting is the real thing!,8,9 September 2020,"Amazing story, with good twists and turns, which never gets boring due to its good pacing. The acting is good and so are the characters, although getting to know everyone took longer than it should have. The other issue is with the main protagonist, as his character is likeable but very flat. Moreover, this was not as comedic as the genre categorisation would suggest, as solely how the story was told was quite comedic.",The Sting
174,cleary-joshua,"This is a feel-good film, which ticks all the right boxes...",8,6 January 2015,"If you look at the 10 films that won an Oscar for ""Best Picture"" in the 1970s, you'd notice a general trend. The majority of them are long, hard-hitting movies – just look at Parts 1 and 2 of ""The Godfather"", ""Patton"" or ""The Deer Hunter"". There are two exceptions to this trend: the hilarious ""Annie Hall"", which was awarded in 1977, and ""The Sting"", which was nominated in a year where none of the other nominees were standard Oscar bait. It's a feel- good film, which ticks all the right boxes in terms of its light-hearted nature, great soundtrack, and the way it embodies its chosen aesthetic.The film tells the story of two con-men, played by Robert Redford and Paul Newman, and their attempts to escape the police and get one over on the crime boss Doyle Lonnegan. It's a film which makes you care about its characters, despite them being criminals, whilst also being fun and keeping you guessing. The film's greatest successes are its plots, from the very opening scene to the big finish at the end. It's cleverly written so that you don't always have as much information as the two leads, making the reveals even more rewarding. Throughout the film, the dynamic between Redford and Newman is outstanding in every emotion they show, whether it be friendship or falling out. Each of them gets to show their skills individually too, and Newman's entry into a poker game halfway through is exemplary acting.The challenge which ""The Sting"" faces is not taking itself too seriously, without being too light-hearted. In order for it to be a success, you have to care about the characters but feel the fun in their capers. The 'prestige' of the film simply wouldn't work if you weren't constantly rooting for the characters and didn't believe that the plan has failed. The film adopts the aesthetic of its time, with inter-titles, costumes and use of Scott Joplin (somewhat anachronistically) to make you feel the Great Depression. It's not a film without flaws, however, and at just over 2 hours, it sometimes feel like it's dragging on.The other problem it faces, which is very difficult to pull off for any film about tricks or magic, is that it occasionally has one too many twists and turns to follow. Discovering late in the day that a character who you've previously believed to be a bad guy is actually working with the whole operation can feel a bit cheap sometimes, and while ""The Sting"" just about pulls it off, it's not always effective.""The Sting"" is undoubtedly a cinematic achievement. While it might not be perfect, it is extremely fun, thanks to two excellent lead performances, and is not afraid to keep its audience guessing its tricks.",The Sting
175,asenkron,"Contains a lot of ""Carlito's Way"" trick methods",10,7 March 2009,"If there was a chance to back to the past, an alternative name would be Gondorff's Way. In some definite movies, couples complete the role of each other perfectly. This is also one great example of them. On the other hand, this doesn't mean famous couples have to create a good energy in enormous projects. For example, I haven't admired the combination of Paul Newman and Robert Redford in Butch Cassidy and Sundance Kid.First of all, In my opinion George Roy Hill made history with this film. The technics, directing methods, effects shortly all details for a director made him deserve all praises and let us watch a wonderful movie. I should admit that I am regretful for postponing to watch this film a considerable time.Newman as Gondorff, Redford as Hooker and Robert Shaw as Doyle Lonnegan are respectable in their roles and present an amazing watching enjoyment fluently during the film.Hooker's incredible advance from a simple vagrancy to an first-class trickings, Gandorff's tactics upon cheats for gamble and fake organizations upon deceiving Lonnegan and of course Lonnegan's self-confidence are all admirable. I couldn't find a point that may be criticized but as usual Paul Newman dominates Robert Redford even if the due to needed role. But, if necessary to be honest, Redford shows one of the best-second man role in the film.When I saw Carlito's Way, I was very happy to see it, but this film contains a lot of ""Carlito's Way"". Furthermore, some predictable twist and turns reminded me Hitchcock's North by Northwest.Ask for The Sting? When we watch the Academy Awards, there aren't too many respectable films. Shortly, IMDb 250 list has proved itself and The Sting made an impression on me. I absolutely suggest the people who are curious about it.",The Sting

177,Laitue_Gonflable,Classic Entertainment,9,4 March 2003,"The Sting is a quite brilliant and thoroughly entertaining film with a unique style of its own. It manages to mirror both the 70's in which it was made in terms of its film-making and visually the 1930's in which it is set. Robert Redford and Paul Newman both give enjoyable performances and the rather unusual, at least by today's standards, cinematography is a real winner that makes this film stand out. Admittedly, the plot is quite predictable but I don't think it matters. When I watched this film I was constantly guessing that everything that befalls Redford and Newman in the course of their con, is set up deliberately to create the facade, and as it comes out in the end, that is correct. But all it does is make it more enjoyable; when the end is approaching, the anticipation of what is about to happen is intense and an extremely likeable experience, although I can imagine that to certain members of a modern film generation, the sort of person who enjoys Fincher's films for the violence, the predictability would somewhat spoil this film, but to someone who enjoys a good story, this is the right movie.Scott Joplin's music is also a superb backdrop for the story and while the music is not there to set atmosphere or mood, it suits the movie well and embodies the themes and values displayed in the film. It is fitting that the movie begins with the piece ""The Entertainer"" because that is exactly what this movie is. 5 stars out of 5.",The Sting

179,severindringel,A film of a very different kind,9,31 December 2020,"When you think of this gangster film from 1973, you automatically associate it with its legendary score. The Entertainer is a song with cult status and breathes even more life into The Sting than the film already has. Led by the two acting icons Robert Redford and Paul Newman, this two hour long film is entertaining at all times. For its originality it won seven awards at the Oscars, including in the main category of Best Picture.The film can also be seen as Robert Redford's big breakthrough. He plays an experienced mug who cheats his way through life with dirty tricks and rips people off with his partner. He is always careful to stage this without the use of violence. When he suddenly finds himself without a partner, he teams up with one of the country's most notorious gangsters, played by Newman, and vows revenge against a rival gangster. The chemistry between the two main characters is palpable in every scene and they always dominate the screen.The Sting is such a specal film mainly because, unlike other gangster films it doesn't go for bloodsheds. The era of the mafia film was ushered in the previous year by The Godfather and perfectly revolutionised by The Sting. Until then, it was hardly known how many facets this genre actually has. In this case, it solves its problems in a very humorous and subtle way that leaves it open until the end what will actually happen. As a result, the film can be a little long-winded in places without delivering a great spectacle. But since this leisurely process is clearly intentional, you still remain focused and eager to see what happens next. The Sting is an incomparable film that, due to its peculiarity, is clearly to be considered a classic!",The Sting

This movie really is homageto a simpler time in America where you can't help rooting for thecon artists.

This sluggish film absolutely does not deserve to be called a classic or a masterpiece or flawless or anything of the sort. How in the world did it attain such unearned prestige among critics and film buffs? How often are there stretches in this film in which nothing noteworthy happens? Why does the film make us wait for such a feeble climax? These questions were swirling in my head as I grappled with finally getting through this lumbering mess after I first gave it a shot. As a teenager, I didn't make it half-way through. Twenty-five years later, watching it the second time around, I had the strong temptation to turn it off again. It was every bit as boring and uneventful as I remembered. This is Exhibit A that not all old films were better.Don't get me wrong. It does have its good points, like a great 1930s jazz soundtrack and excellent period detail, fully capturing 1930s big city America. But the look and feel of a film are not enough when the story lacks energy and is not compelling. There are a couple of well-executed scenes sprinkled here and there (like the card game on the train), but they are entombed in this lifeless, overlong piece of dreck. It is laughable to me that a film this poorly made would win the Oscar for Best Picture. Was everyone just stoned in 1973? I know it has a huge following, but it's just not enough to simply listen to the consensus- because here the consensus is dead wrong.

Snooty critics were hoping against hope that what they considered a ""great film"" would upset ""The Sting"" and take home Best Picture. That ""great film"" was ""The Exorcist"" and since I lacked the courage to sneak into an ""R"" rated feature I had not seen it. Well ""The Sting"" walked away with 7 Oscars and became one of the biggest hits of the decade playing in Spokane for over 35 weeks. It was in the days before VHS and people had fond memories of films and could only hope that they would play soon on network television.Why was ""The Sting"" so under appreciated by establishment commentators? Well for one thing that despite the plot twists it was a realatively straight forward feature. It lacked deep meaning, it wasn't in line with the ""message"" films that were becoming popular at the time. The idea of recasting The Butch & Sundance stars was considered a pure marketing ploy. There was also the belief that if a film was really entertaining that it couldn't be that good.A lot of those ""message"" films look pretty feeble nowadays after the context has vanished. The Exorcist now looks pretty tame by todays gore standards. ""The Sting"" holds up perfectly with countless lines of the script embedded in film-goers' minds. Not only were these great line but they were all delivered perfectly. Even the bit parts are flawlessly executed. To this day when I doubt the likeliness of any sort of venture succeeding I can say ""Flate Rate"" to a number of friends and they will know exactly what I mean.Another valuable asset to ""The Sting"" is that it is fit for kids to see.

They are 2 different movies but I found this one more substantialone reason could be that I am not a big fan of Westerns. The 1st hr of the movie isn't as well paced as the 2ndthis is when Newman appears. This is also one of the rare movies that I have seen where they use the word Con which I guess is usually restricted to fiction novels. It has a good plot, no doubt about that. The screenplay is well done especially for the train scene. Another worth noting thing about the movie is its art direction, you really feel you are into 1930s. It is hard to say who, Newman or Redford has done better job, just like in Butch & Cassidy.

Sure, Scott Joplin music was actually popular several decades before the 1930s (when the film was set), but who cares? It sounds great and fits the mood perfectly, if not the time period.If you're the kind of person thinks that good films need to be deep and filled with angst, you probably won't consider this to be a good film, because it's the least angst-y movie imagineable.

Robert Redford, in one of the two lead roles, is Luther's friend and partner-in-crime, Johnny Hooker, a brash young grifter who seeks the help of Paul Newman as Henry Gondorff, a wise and experienced con man who has forgotten more about grifting than most grifters ever know. Hooker wants to find a way to con Doyle Lonnegan, played by Robert Shaw, the gangster boss who ordered Luther Coleman's hit when Hooker and Coleman pull a grift on a ""mark"" who happened to be carrying the week's take on the rackets for one of Lonnegan's managers.And therein lies the story: the ""sting"" of Doyle Lonnegan, who is a dangerous gangster with no inhibitions on ordering a hit on anyone who crosses him up or threatens his position in the organized crime world.The movie plays out suspensfully, with several twists to the plot that all come together at the end. I'm glad I'm old enough to have seen this movie when it first came out, so I didn't know what those twists were, and I won't spoil the movie by giving them away.What I am going to say: when you're tired of all the movies that are big-budget action stories, when you've had enough of the movies that are sequels and prequels and spin-offs made because they can make money, when you're fed up with comic-book heroes and movies made from books or ""graphic novels"" or other sources that guarantee the movie an audience, sit down and watch ""The Sting."" You'll be seeing a genuine original movie made by and with people who loved what they do and do it well. You'll come away at the end wishing that someone would make movies like ""The Sting"" now, just for a change....And you'll be seeing a movie that is one of the all-time great entertainment movies ever made.",The Sting
194,stephen7272,All Paul Newman,6,20 April 2013,"The Sting succeeds on two levels. It succeeds with it's plot and it succeeds with it's characters. This is a rare feat, since most movies fail on both.The mere suggestion that it's possible to win at gambling is horrendous to many people. But to win by cheating is even more of a crime. However, to those of us who have lost a small sum on a pony or a hand of cards, The Sting is a smug rebuke at the bookies.Paul Newman carries this movie. His pool shooting character Fast Eddie in The Color Of Money, and jail bird, egg-swallowing Luke have matured into an experienced, confident hustler. We don't think of Paul Newman as the king of crime, but he has more cinematic criminal form than Marlon Brando. Paul Newman is the acceptable version of the criminal world, a role taken over by Tom Hanks in Road To Perdition.The movie is about cause and effect. If you do A then B will happen. And it never fails. It's also about making words fail...I've explained that in my review of Titanic.Of course in the real world, something, many things would have gone wrong with the plan in The Sting. Somebody would have sneezed, resulting in a moustache falling off, revealing the entire scam. The whole idea works on the thinnest of error margins.It's quite frightening how the concept of The Sting solidified itself in the real world of finance with the scandals of Enron and the sale of sub-prime mortgage CDO's to unsuspecting investors. The Sting shows how easily people can be fooled by the promise of making a quick buck.A movie to watch once, probably twice, but three times is once too many.",The Sting
195,michaeltong-29180,I Got Stung,5,17 October 2018,"The big con here is the score, I don't get it. The film is neither bad nor good, it's just flat. There is no dramatic tension, suspense, or emotion. There are a few peaks that keep things interesting, for example the compelling poker scene that built up the characters well, but other than that The Sting has no pulse.It's so mundane I don't even know what to say about it. At least if it were terrible I could be amused by all the things it did wrong, or if it was a masterpiece I could marvel at its timeless elements. Alas, The Sting is like eating a plain cracker. It will give you some nourishment, but it will neither fill you or excite your taste-buds.",The Sting
196,LaDonnaKeskes,The Sting has no sting,5,10 January 2011,"I anticipated the ""surprise"" finish, which has been reproduced in other films to better effect. What a slow-moving, tedious slog. This is only for people who really like long, long setups. Play a card game, dodge a bullet. Run a wire store, dodge more bullets. The only time I as entertained was in the first 10 minutes. As to the script, what's in it? Not a single comedic line, not a single bit of physical or situational humor, not a single memorable quote. Robert Redford's stylishly tousled golden hair never lets us forget that this is the 70s, not the 30s. As for a caper flick, Redford's ""Sneakers"" was snappier and funnier.This comes across as a vanity vehicle for the star power of Redford and Newman. I'm not sorry I watched it, but now that I have I can forget it. I'm not a huge fan of either actor, so I had not bothered to see it in theatres, and I sure didn't miss anything. ""American Graffiti,"" a sharper, funnier, more affecting, and overall IMMENSELY better film, should have won the Oscar. This film is a crashing bore.",The Sting
197,Artless_Dodger,Undeniable star power and top quality production values lift this depression set caper movie.,7,24 January 2016,"Undeniable star power and top quality production values lift this depression set caper movie into something more than the standard fayre it might otherwise be. In reality, it's lightweight entertainment, but it's put together with panache and a lightness of touch and you can't help but enjoy it.Robert Redford was bigger box office when this film was made and his role affords him much more screen time that that given to his co- star, Paul Newman. It's a shame because it's the scene's that involve the two of them together that leave the most impression. Their previous, superior, outing made the most of their combined chemistry and you can't help but wonder if this movie could have been even more fun.If you feel like a little light-hearted entertainment one afternoon, this will do nicely.

You aren't blown away by anything, though the costumes and sets are fantastic. The Sting, quite simply, wants to entertain you, while offering a very interesting plot. This is where it succeeds, as you'll be hard pressed to find a movie that combines fun and a great plot as well as writing than The Sting. I won't go into details, but this is a movie you should watch beginning to end, with no interruptions. Otherwise, you will probably miss some important details. But let me tell you, I got sucked right in, all the way to a great ending which I won't spoil for you. It's just a wonderful movie.

199,calyeager,It's worth four threes!,9,29 March 2021,"George Roy Hill knew that Newman and Redford were an impeccable combination from Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid and decided to go for it again. This movie inspired how I think about cinema in a few fundamental ways. The first is that the film never gives the audience all of the information (never ""shows its hand"", if you will). The swindles on the viewer feel fresh and so ridiculously different from contemporary heist movies that instead describe the plan so when it goes wrong you feels the pressure. The second is that each piece of the film feels like it contributes nicely to a solid resolution. With the exception that I felt Redford's character should have given his earnings to Luther's widow, the film was logical and worked to a point. I'd give The Sting a 9/10.",The Sting

Reflecting on this , this movie is not that great. Compare this to nowadays series in the likes of The sopranos or Boardwalk empire and this movie falls flat on acting, pacing.As for the directing : its too much directed, you feel that all the scenes are so carefully chosen and that the characters are mainly there to fill the screen. Now, we have today also directors such as Tarantino where you know that every single scene is already played in his head before someone hits the record button, but it doesn't feel that way in most cases ( at least not in this time , maybe in 20 years it does ). I must admit that I do not like Redford. His acting- skills are as bad as Bruce Willis and let's keep it friendly and call it overacting or trying to act. The music is nice though and fits. The sets are OK, but so so visible as done in studio. I liked this movie in the 70's , less liked it in the 80's , and by now I don't like it anymore. It's a typical movie of its time and fortunate there are other older movies which stand the time-test better.",The Sting
201,zianimustafa,The Sting(1973),10,19 January 2018,"The meeting of the crime with the drama in a comic template, it seems to you that the commercial commercial announcement only no more and no less, but there is a strange feeling in this film after I saw him but I thought it was a period and go away but after watching it again I realized that it is not just a comedy and crime And some drama, I discovered that it is a film that combines the beauty of performance and the quality of the output (George Roy, who received his film this Oscar) and the magnificence of the script and its simplicity. All these things attracted me to the film and even repeated viewing does not make you bored although the quality of such films may classify films She has lived her experience only once.About the film: The story of a young man (first-rate shooter / Robert Redford) in the 1930s in Chicago turns escape with his skin from a gang and uses his old friend Henry (Paul Newman). Great events mixed with a comic template make you not tired of watching this movie, with the theme of the beginning, which is a landmark and famous as you hear it until you remember this movie.",The Sting
202,Valek-5,Brilliant,10,18 October 1999,"This is undoubtedly one of Redford's best movies.  I found everything about this movie spellbounding.  The twists, the suspense and the sheer brilliance and plotting of the sting itself.  The plot, the storyline, everything is amazing.  Something else about the movie is watching Robert Redford.  He was a lot younger then and a lot faster, but he hasn't changed all that much.If you haven't seen this movie, watch it.  It will keep you riveted!",The Sting

It was an interesting story and I like the theme music (now made familiar through music played by the neighborhood Good Humor man), but there was not enough action. I found myself sitting around waiting for something interesting to happen but nothing ever did. It wasn't that the plot was weak. It's just that things that happened in the plot were NOT INTERESTING! I don't quite understand why this movie is considered a classic. Maybe it just wasn't my kind of movie. If anything, this movie is for cinema fanatics only. It's too much art and not enough substance. Not for the excitement and intrigue seeker.",The Sting
204,grafspee,Fabulous 1930's style movie with a flawless script of two con artists seeking revenge on a gangster for the death of a personal friend.,10,28 February 2010,"You would never get tired of watching this exciting film with Paul Newman as (Henry Gondorff) and Robert Redford (Johnny Hooker) combining to form a partnership, to set up mean vindictive respectable style gangster Robert Shaw (Doyle Lonergan) with a well planned heist, for ordering the killing of well loved drifter Luther Coleman (played by Robert Jones), who conned one of Lonergan's runners out of several thousand dollars in illegal cash. Gondorff, getting himself on a train from New York to Chicago gets involved in a cheating game of poker with equally cheating Lonergan and wins his stakes infuriating the latter accordingly, particularly when he finds out that he was staked on his own pick pocketed cash.Hooker plays up to Lonergan with a ruse of taking over Gondorff's enterprise and citing his basement racing shop as a means of getting control and inducing Lonergan to bet money on past posted races via an elaborate set up on a false con with a Western Union wire relay.In between there is corrupt Lt. Snyder (Charles Durning) State Police (Bunko Squad) who thinks he has a deal with a fictitious FBI team to get Gondorff (for a promise of reward dollars), for nabbing Hooker and getting him to rat on Gondorff.Lonergan thinking he has now the perfect means of taking down Gondorff places a huge half million dollar bet on a past posted race. The fake FBI intervenes just at the end falsely shooting Hooker and Gondorff,who are playing dead , Lonergan exits at Snyders insistence because of two murders having just occurred, raving at his loss of money left in the racing shop.In the meantime the team cleans up - Gorndorff and Hooker come back to life and they all share in Lonergan's proceeds.This movie could well be described as acting within acting because that what it is - a perfectly rehearsed tale of deception by a host of characters who played their parts splendidly -great cast and one of the best productions I have seen.The musical piano ragtime tunes of Scott Joplin interposed therein throughout the sequences add a special flavor to one of my favorite best films.",The Sting

Was just a kid then and it made NO sense to me - or my folks.Reconnected with it in the 1990s when video rental was all the rage and it won me over for life! I LOVE IT and rewatch it at least once or twice a year.The costumes and sets are immersive and the plot takes more twists and turns than Mario Andretti could keep on course with. That is awesome because 1) it engages you and 2) it keeps the movie unpredictable yet 3) believable.The acting in it is great, just great! The actors all seem to have a chemistry and authenticity that makes all their interactions and relationships very very believable.There's some great lines in it too.

These two guys go together like Laurel and Hardy or Tracy and Hepburn, by now they should have made at least 3 more movies together. I herd Newman wants to make only one more movie and make it his swan song and then retire, I hope its with Robert Redford.

It's the over-the-top plot (probably one of the greatest in the American filmography ever), the great performances by all the actors, the card tricks, the surprises, the music, and so much more.Someone might think that it's far too silly of a movie. Well, I only have one thing to say: Look further. It isn't just an indulgent movie; it's one with a point: a tribute to friendship, loyalty; the clever (Redford-Newman) against the wicked (Shaw); it may as well be another version of a Bildungs-roman: Redford doesn't only take revenge for his friend's death. He learns and learns as the movie goes along. It takes more than lust to beat the powerful; he has to learn about real life first.I rest my case.

209,darthmatthew-442-606491,The greatest con film,8,21 August 2012,"So I watched ""The Sting"" a couple days ago, and now, here is the review. In 1973, ""The Sting"" won the Oscar for best picture, and for your information, it mostly likely deserved it.The story was pure genius; it totally had me fooled until the end. The story moved along smoothly, never at any point did it become boring. Every scene had purpose, and overall, it felt very polished. It stands as my favorite heist movie.The characters were mostly excellent. The main characters were well developed and had interesting back stories; however some characters, although they only played a minor part, felt deficient of information. I would have preferred it if they had at least were named, like in Ocean's Eleven for example, where all the team members had a defined part in the con. This was a minor issue though.The acting was simply perfect. Robert Redford is perfect as usual, and Paul Newman gave me goosebumps as the colorful Henry Gondorff. During one scene, I simply had to smile because of Newman's screen presence. The cinematography felt very familiar to that of the Ocean's series; I wouldn't be surprised if Ocean's Eleven borrowed it from ""The Sting"". I have always loved the style of editing and cinematography that is employed by movies such as ""The Sting"". It is abnormal, yes, but also interesting and different.The music added the final touch. It fit perfectly with the setting.Overall, ""The Sting"" was gripping, humorous, and dramatic, all at the same time. Although it wasn't emotionally impactful, and you won't be leaving with any life changing messages, ""The Sting"" is still an absolute blast. It feeds off the charm of the actors, and the brilliant story to deliver a true masterpiece.",The Sting
210,Achoo42,Timeless masterpiece,10,16 January 2017,"At first I was only interested in this movie because of the prominence of Scott Joplin, but I soon found out that it had a lot more going for it than just the score.Highs: Let's start off with the obvious: the soundtrack. Even if the movie was unbelievably bad the music would still be good. I mean, it's Scott Joplin! I'm not going to give Marvin (may he rest in peace) too much credit here because all he did was adapt it a little, but kudos for using Scott Joplin in the first place. For a 1930s-style movie the script is on point. Not only is it witty but it just sounds like what would be expected of the era. Very entertaining in and of itself; the same thing could be said of the soundtrack.We can't leave off the plot; this movie is in fact so plot-centric that it would probably be considered a failure if George Roy Hill somehow managed to not pull it off smoothly. Of course, it all works out like clockwork, and it's a fantastically entertaining series of events to watch.The acting is impeccable. I've seen better but really it can't get that much better than this. Redford and Newman work together just as well as in their previous masterwork ""Cassidy and the Kid"", or, rather, have the audience fooled otherwise. Seems a little clichéd but remember this is a 70s movies; it's only a cliché now BECAUSE of this movie. The plot twist was in no way dated in the time period in which it was shown. I'm not going to spoil it; to do that would be an injustice to any first-time watchers.Despite the seeming anachronism, the Sting still retains a strangely timeless quality.Lows: Any Joplin purist (which I often will be) will oppose to the orchestral adaption of the pieces. I actually have no problem with these adaptations, they don't really feel out of place or anything. Which leads me to the next point: Joplin's music SHOULD be out of place. He was already a forgotten figure for at least 15 years when the movie took place. With that being said though, the soundtrack still fits swimmingly with the rest of the work. It's actually incredible how well the song selection fits with the plot. If you know Joplin and can name the tunes as soon as they float from the screen (as can I) then you really have to give Marvin credit for placing them where they are. ""The Entertainer"", of course, is during the opening and the title selection; where the audience requires a little...entertainment. ""Easy Winners"" is played right after Luther and Hooker walk away loaded after a con...easy money. And Solace is, of course, played during Hooker's search for love...or solace. I can't find anything to say about the ""Pineapple Rag"", for obvious reasons (this movie doesn't mention or show fruit very much at all) but the others are pretty genius.The only real con here is that Marvin is given a little bit too much credit. Many people will remember him as the ""composer"" of the brilliant tunes while it is in fact the one and only Scott Joplin who originated them. That is probably the only legitimate low I can find here.",The Sting
211,jscherber,No headline.,8,26 December 2020,"The strongest aspect of this film is the plot. The con devised by the protagonists is incredibly elaborate and rather than being explained at the beginning, the viewer learns it by watching it play out. This allows it to cleverly surprise the audience several times and only at the end do we fully understand it. Another strong aspect is the production design. The sets and costumes manage to create a beautiful and fully authentic picture of the 1930s and the film could probably stand on its imagery alone.
The protagonists Hooker and Gondorff are both likable but the character who really stands out is the antagonist, Doyle Lonnegan. He has a quiet, aloof demeanor and lives a straight edge lifestyle but is shown to be utterly ruthless and his actor, Robert Shaw, gives an intimidating performance. A lot of entertaining side characters can also be found, particularly among the con artsits.
Another noteworthy aspect is the dialogue, which is rich with slang and colloquialisms from the time period. Some might find it a bit confusing, while others will like it.
The ragtime music, though anachronistic for the time period, is another strong point and does a great job of setting the mood. Overall, though I'm not sure if I would consider it one of the greatest films ever made, I thoroughly enjoyed this and recommend it to anyone.",The Sting

Yes, both its setting and release-date go back to a more innocent time so don't expect blood, guts, and explosions, but what a well written film this is.  The characters and acting are superb, the story is fantastic, and the ending is one of the most classic of all time!  Newman and Redford are both great, as is the entire cast.  Cops, comedy, and cons at every turn!  What an excellent motion picture.  If you're disappointed in ""The Sting,"" then you have no idea what a classic movie is all about and maybe you should try and write a better movie yourself.  Just look at the awards this classic won and you'll get the drift.  The scenes of the poker game on the train are classic Redford/Newman/Shaw and remain among my favorite pieces of film writing/acting of all time.

It was, of course, ""The Sting."" The next week I saw it and I felt the same way.I don't think there is any such thing as a flawless movie but ""The Sting"" comes close. First, the cast. You can't beat a Newman/Redford combination and American movie-goers were hoping that the 2 actors would star in another movie again but it didn't happen. Robert Shaw, Eileen Brennan, Charles Durning, Dana Elcar, Ray Walston, and Harold Gould all put in fantastic performances.Second, the story. The movie takes place in Chicago around 1935. Prohibition had been repealed a few years earlier and another way to make some money was pulling off a few scams--both big and little.Redford plays Johnny Hooker, a small-time hustler who works in a threesome with Luther Coleman and Joe Erie. The three grifters work well together and steal a lot of money, until one day they con a guy who's a ""runner"" for Doyle Lonagan (Shaw) take $11,000. Doyle is determined to track down these guys and kill them. He has Luther killed but can't find the other 2. In the meantime, Hooker goes to Chicago and teams up with Henry Gondorf (Newman), who used to work ""big cons"" but has now settled down in a whorehouse with a madame named Billie (Brennan). They decide to do one last ""big con"" and Lonagan's the ""mark."" Gondorf gets all his old friends together and they plan a huge ""sting"" against Lonagan. Besides planning out the con, they also have to make sure nothing else happens because a crooked detective (Snyder) is after Hooker.What's interesting about this movie is that you are also part of ""the sting""--only you don't know it! When you watch this at home, please put it on pause if you get up from your comfortable seat, as you can't afford to miss a minute, you really have to follow the movie. And the ending is enough to make you fall out of your seat.Hollywood doesn't make movies like this anymore and it's a shame!",The Sting

The twists are all through the movie untill the unexpected climax. The screen play is very tight and all characters have played their part very well. THe way Paul Newman cons Robert shaw in the poker and the way everytime he calls him with a wrong name is worth watching and is very hilarious.The movie has a very intellegent plot. The only hole I saw in the movie was if the assasin ""Salino"" knows who Hooker was (Robert Redford) how he is able to con her boss Lonnegan (Robert shaw) as Kelly.

I think this is the first time I saw Paul Newman in the screen and I must say am impressed. I really look forward to see more of him. The poker scene was perfect in this scene I was sold. He plays incredible well in this film and he overshadows in my opinion Robert Redford( its not a competition tho, but you get what I am saying).

218,crood,"Entertaining, but Not Without Flaws",8,2 March 2018,"It's always entertaining and I'll usually watch it if it's on. Redford and Newman have great chemistry. The supporting cast is full of TV and Movie veterans like Ray Walston and Harold Gould who round out a solid cast. The best is most certainly Robert Shaw as Lonnegan. He's a truly brutal main who only barely manages to maintain the cover of a legitimate businessman. You always feel he's about ten seconds away from killing someone.For fans of Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid, note this is not a Redford/Newman buddy picture. The character dynamic is that of mentor and student. Hooker is clearly the main character and in the bulk of the scenes, whereas outside the poker game, Newman doesn't have much in the way of character development and rarely appears without Redford. As I said, the chemistry is still great, there's just not as much of it and Redford interacts with more of the rest of the cast.I'd say the biggest problem is the ending. How the sting is actually played out. It really feels that they didn't have good idea and use a twist of language the NO ONE would ever use in the real world. The followup is arguably even worse and it presumes Shaw and Charles Durning's cop character won't read a newspaper the next day. That would be fine if they hadn't made a point that Lonnegan could never know he'd been conned. However, it does recover a bit with a final interaction between Redford and Newman. They really are a likeable pair with a natural chemistry.",The Sting

There are many episodes of the TV show ""Hustle"" better than this movie.Many (!) scenes between main characters exist solely to mislead the audience, no need to play conning each other all dramatically behind closed doors. It is quite annoying if you already smell the rat.""Comedy""? Didn't even smile once.
Costumes? Well, ok, a couple of pinstripe suits and a completely unnecessary fake beard = Oscar.
The music is annoying, basically the same melody over and over, kept reminding me of Tom &Jerry. Won an Oscar.
And so on...to win ""Best Picture"".Sidenote, rigged poker game: he changes your ordered cards? Well, then show everyone the whole deck, his cards have to be doubles. Not a big deal, most people won't care, still so badly thought out. So many unnecessarily risky/easily examinable situations to make it cinematic.As soon as the ""FBI"" says to keep it from the police, no mystery for the finale is left. Boring and stupid(ly acting people).Without the charme of the two (morally bankrupt...) protagonists this movie has nothing.

I think ""Saving Private Ryan"" knocked it off, but that's understandable. ""The Sting"" is still the greatest movie I have seen whose prime intent is to entertain the viewer.  I usually give this style movie less of a rating, because humans are, in essence, pretty darn easy to entertain, but to get them to THINK is a lot harder (which is why ""Saving Private Ryan"" and ""The Truman Show"" are the only movies I have ever given a higher rating to.Everything about this movie is great.  From the acting to the music, it is simply phenomenal.  The whole story itself is great, some of the individual scenes are unforgettable, and right to individual lines and reactions, ""The Sting"" exemplifies great writing, directing, and acting.  For purposes of this rating system, I give it a 10.  On my personal scale, a 9.4.  If you've never seen this movie, something is very, very wrong.",The Sting

If you want to be caught with a giant grin, finishing the film up to five times and still saying 'what?', then watch 'The Sting'.Funny, fast and entertaining from start to finish, I much prefer 'The Sting' to its sadder counterpart 'Butch Cassidy'. This film is about a young man (Robert Redford) who suffers an injustice in his hometown with one of his close friends. This prompts him to go looking for a man to help (Paul Newman) and they set the movie into cartwheel after cartwheel of dizzying, 'what'-like scenes as they frame a rich man with their 'sting' operation.In the end you will have a smile on, yet still be trying to figure how they pulled off that last sting. And this adds to the joy, because then you can justify watching it again and again!I recommend this film for anyone over the age of twenty who likes movies like 'Ocean's Eleven' and 'The Usual Suspects'- this is truly the best of its genre, the acting is superb and the plot funny as it is fast-paced.

It is a treat to see Paul Newman and Robert Redford act together in The Sting - their chemistry is really cool. When I see them together on the screen, it just looks right. They both give great performances, Redford as the young grifter Johnny Hooker and Newman as Henry Gondorff, the experienced con man he teams up with to execute 'The Sting': the big con of a lifetime. Newman, especially, has some very memorable scenes. The Joplin ragtime score and the 'chaptered' setup of the plot are both wonderful compliments, and, like the actors, they are just right for the film. If you watch this movie (I recommend it for almost anyone), make sure to pay close attention, because the intricate plot and the specialized vocabulary of the script may give you a run for your money.

229,Dvd Avins,Forgotten Influence,10,27 January 2004,"So often, when something about a film enters into the culture at large, it actually diminishes the film for later generations. That's because the aspect which is so striking to the original audience is commonplace to those who come after.The use of ragtime in The Sting is a good example of that. It had been almost forgotten music, which had very little popularity from WWII until the Hamlisch arrangements caught people's fancy here. It was that that IMO caused the brief flurry of piano and orchestral interpretations of Joplin's work through the rest of the 1970s. And ragtime has never receded to its old post-war levels since. Because of that, the music is not likely to seem as new and therefore as delightful as it did in 1973.The Sting is also, of course, a wonderful example of revenge served cold. In that regard it's the only film that form me does as good a job as Poe's short story The Cask of Amontillado.",The Sting

I've seen it so many times I can quote most of it by heart, yet every time I watch it, I just can't help but laugh at all of the same scenes and be throughly mesmerized by what's happening on the screen in front of me. Paul Newman and Robert Redford are real stars in this film, and in my opinion neither have made better films before or after this (although Redford comes close with All the President's Men). And the villain... well, once you see Robert Shaw in this role once, you can't help but think ""yeh fallah?"" any time you see him again.The whole plot is centered around the ""Big Con,"" a massive confidence scheme that involves many of CHicago's top con artists. As tensions rise (assassins...the mob... the FBI!), the viewer can't help but watch in awe as the cool demeanor of Newman and the rugged enthusiasm of Redford captivate your heart.

This is truly a timeless movies you can still watch it and be awed. Paul Newman is also quite a towering figure throughout the movie, is has enough twists in the plot and unexpectedness to keep you seated for the full 3 hours! Have not seen Robert Shaw who plays Doyle Lonnegan the villain of this movie in many other films, but his performance stands out, he will creep you out as a villain, I cant think of many who have been able to have such an effect in the role of a villain, and his limping makes it really uncanny.If you are a movie buff you should definitely not miss this one.It's 10/10 for me.",The Sting

233,Belgand-4,"Fun, but vastly over-rated fluff.",3,15 April 2006,"While the Sting was entertaining it is also astoundingly over-rated.The music, while setting a fun mood, is incorrect as ragtime had fallen out of favor 20-25 years before the film is set. Likewise the costuming and set design are cartoony and create a sense of time and place that never existed and will only be recalled by viewer who have little to no experience with the actual time and place and simply view it as ""old-timey"". The sets in particular stand out as being obvious studio backlots and the requisite editing to make chases and the like seem seamless are glaringly obvious.Most films based on cons tend to share the characteristic of keeping something back from the audience in order to keep a level of suspense up that would otherwise be lacking (afterall, the viewer is in on the con already). There are a couple of such cases in this film, but they're all pretty obviously telegraphed and the ending feels a bit hollow as everything simply plays out before you just the way you thought it would. Even without knowing the details of some of the cons used they're all presented simply and obviously enough that it's no feat to tell what's going on. At times it feels like the film has intentionally set the bar a bit low so that the audience will feel special and clever for picking up on the supposed ""twists"".Redford and Newman both do a decent job, but (especially in Redford's case) neither seems to really inhabit their role. Instead it's just Redford playing the guy who's a conman rather than a legitimate character.At the same time it's still a fun and enjoyable film. A good way to waste away a lazy weekend afternoon.

It's hard to explain what's so great about this. It has the duo of Newman and Redford which was shown to be a good match in Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid. It has a lot of great dialogue, and it even manages to have quite a few action sequences. But the best thing about this movie is how the Con has a sort of life of its own. It steals the show. There is some fine acting in this movie from some of the best actors in the history of film, but it's all about the Con. The best moments in the film are when the secrets of the con men are revealed.

There have been plenty of films that have the twists and turns but the first time you see ""The Sting"", you truly see how so many other films had stolen for this one.This movie is a ""period piece"" and that can't be forgotten. The scenery really gives the film a 1920/30's feel to it, right down to the train ride and train stations. I do hope more young people check out and see this film. I mean Newman and Redford in there prime to boot. I have to tell you, these 2 guys are great - there is a reason they were the super-stars of the time and to be honest.

After seeing The Sting and shortly thereafter, Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid, upon the insistence of my father I realized that perhaps the movies of his time had more to offer than simply old vernacular and bad punches. It was around this time that my criteria of the definition of a good movie shifted more towards performance and plot rather than special effects and bullets. Sometimes our parents are right. I should note that when I first watched this movie I was about 10 years old and spent most of my days playing outside and watching espn fishing shows on Saturday morning, waiting for the highlights.The Sting features the lovable give and take, son and father, leads Paul Newman and Robert Redford.

239,lifetimejuli,Crime for the Whole Family,8,10 June 2009,"It's good to see a movie more concerned with humor and character than with blood and death like The Sting, a comedy film directed by George Roy and written by David S. Ward. The Sting won seven Oscar's not only because every element in the film leads credibility to the story. But also, the two stars (Paul Newman & Robert Redford) make all the difference between simply an OK film and a greater one. Redford plays Johnny Hooker, whose friend and mentor Luther Coleman (Robert Earl Jones) is murdered by millionaire Doyle Lonnegan (Robert Shaw). Hoping to avenge Luther's death, Johnny begins planning an elaborate scam to destroy Lonnegan. He enlists the aid of ""The greatest con artist of them all,"" Henry Gondorff (Paul Newman) Hooker and Gondorff gather together an impressive array of con men, all of whom hate Lonnegan and wish to settle accounts on behalf of Luther. The twists and surprises that follow are too complex to relate in detail. The Sting is a film that holds up a few surprises until the very end, keeping the audience in suspense. One of my favorite scenes is at the beginning of the movie when Hooker and Luther scam several thousand dollars of a cop, who turn out to be a corruptive one, working for Doyle Lonnegan. It is a funny scene with a twist. This scene sets the pattern of the movie. If, I had to point out a blemish, I would consider the slower pace of some of the scene, and the looks of the hookers. They were not attractive at all. Maybe the director purposely planned to focus the attention on the two good-looking starts. Overall, The Sting is a great choice for movie watchers who enjoy a good Hollywood gangster movie.",The Sting
240,krcoe,The Sting,10,8 June 2009,"The movie The Sting was released in 1973. It is about Jonny Hooker, a small time hustler, happy to play the marks in Joliet until one day his mentor, Luther, gets murdered by the dirtiest mug in Chicago, Doyle Lonnegan. Jonny would rather kill Doyle outright, but then settles for a big con that will hurt Doyle's pride. Jonny gets help for a game scanner named Henry Gondorff. The mood set in the film is perfect. Set aside from most other movies with their moods being dark and heavy, the mood in this film is light and joyful. The Sting has many twists, turns, and a very clever plot. You would have to pay close attention to catch all of them. It consists of one con game after another having not only you fooled but the characters as well. It has its humor. It also has a surprise ending!! The film was very detailed from the setting, to how characters talked, to what they wore. It also has a fast momentum to it. The movie never pauses. Even though the music was made a few years earlier, it goes perfect with the movie. The music has an up beat to it. The cons that go on in the movie keep you on your feet. Wondering if they are going to be caught and when. You can really tell they put a lot of thought not only with the plot of the film but the cons in the movie think everything through. I really liked the film and cannot think of anything bad to say about itPaul Newman and Robert Redford did a flawless job on playing the roles of Henry Gondorff and Jonny Hooker. They were the ones setting up the big con against Doyle Lonnegan. Doyle Lonnegan was played by Robert Shaw, who did a fantastic job taking on the role as the dirtiest mug in Chicago. If and when you watch the movie, you would think that someone was actually filming this and was not a movie. All of the characters did an amazing job playing their roles. Everyone was a contribute to the movie. The ending is fantastic and comes as a total surprise. It is a very detailed film and I want to see it again. It is a little long but worth every minute.

246,footballer239,The Sting can keep its Stinger,6,8 June 2009,"The Sting is set up to take place in the 1930's and is a film about two professionals and how they con a mob boss. The movie is broken down into seven distinct sections. Each section breaks down the major plot of the film. We have a guy named Johnny hooker, played by Redford, who is a small-time con man. He and his fellow men manage to get $11,000 from a guy who was bringing the money to a guy named Lonnegan. His one friend tells him that he is retiring from his crime life and that he should seek Henry Gondorff (Newman) so that he can become a ""big con man."" Gondorff agrees to help Hooker run a sting on Lonnegan for revenge on their friend. Hooker becomes the bait for the scheme that Gondorff is plotting. A majority of the movie is a back and forth gambling fight between the two men on that can out cheats whom. The night before the final act, Hooker hooks up with a new waitress named Loretta. When he wakes up in the morning, she's gone. As he is leaving and walking down the alley, he sees her and a guns man turns the corner and shoots her in the forehead. Hooker finds a gun on her and the guns man tells him that she was plotting to kill him. This gunman is one of Gondorffs friends that have been sent to look over Hooker. The final scene takes place at a gambling parlor where Lonnegan brings a case filled with half a million dollars. Bets are taken and the movie ends with great twist that shocked me. The Sting contained a very tricky plot that shocked me by the time the end of the movie came around. I enjoyed the setting being in the 1930's with the gangsters and mobs. The effects used were very minimal and it made the film to be very realistic. The characters used in the movie made it seem like I was in the 30's and in the city. Some things I didn't enjoy so much were the constant running back and forth between the two sides. The movie took place in Chicago, which I think should've been in New York or some place more northern. For being mobsters, there wasn't a lot of gunplay. It almost seemed as if they tried to make the shootings one on one and secluded from everyone else I enjoyed watching Paul Newman (Gondorff); he played a very smooth and laid back mobster. He was very sneaky in his plot against Robert Shaw (Lonnegan). Overall, I think this movie had a very simple yet tricky plot. There were definite dead scenes and some actors that could've been cut. If this movie had a different cast or director, I think it could've been a lot greater or more enjoyable. I don't think it was a total flop, the three main characters made the movie and I think the movie should've had just those three men because everyone else seemed to be just extras. I would recommend this film for older people over thirty. I wouldn't watch this film again just because I think it had a lot of dead scenes. I'd rate this film 6 out of 10.",The Sting
247,jrocker13,Now I've got the sting,5,7 June 2009,"At first I didn't get the title of this film, but after watching it I realized that ""the sting"" was referring to the addiction to gamble. The cast was very well picked out and played their characters wonderfully. The one that really stood out to me was Eileen Brennan. I loved how she played the sultry hostess while getting away with covering up being a pick pocket. This film should be considered a classic because it does bring back the glory days. All the sets and stage areas were crafted so beautifully that it was possible to lose yourself in the movie. The picture itself was not that clear and in my opinion, a little bit fuzzy. But that just added to the overall ambiance. Some things I didn't like about this move was that the plot did get confusing from the middle to the ending. The actors themselves played their characters well, but there could have been better interaction between them. At several points in the movie it seemed that there was no genuine interaction between the characters that were supposed to be working together. Betting and gambling was never any interest of mine so the fact that this movie revolved around that was kind of boring to me. It was fun however, watching foolish men gamble away their money in the hopes of making more on what they bet. The best part was at the beginning when Hooker and Luther pull of a con to get eleven grand from an unsuspecting target. I really believed that Hooker gave the guy the money and was surprised when he opened the package to find tissues instead of money. I would recommend this movie to anyone who enjoys watching movie's with clever plots and memorable actors.",The Sting
248,canganjj,Easily one of the most entertaining films to date,10,9 June 2003,"I have a hard time believing that anyone can dislike this film, for the simple fact that it has become the quintessential gambling/caper film.  By calling this film ""mediocre"" is doing it a severe disservice. The acting is top notch (except for Dana Elcar, who is noticeably corny in everything), the direction is tight and the film's overall presentation is very cohesive. The music, as adapted from many of Scott Joplin's pieces (which were by no means popular when he wrote them) have been adapted for the film and helped fuel a resurging interest in his work that was definitely ahead of its time. It is hard to ignore both a work of art and commercial success, so if you haven't seen this film yet, please do yourself a favor and rent it tonight. However, if you wish to purchase the DVD, I would wait until the 30th Anniversary Edition is released this year (although I haven't dug up any information on it thus far), because the current edition out right now is a bare bones fullscreen presentation which is noticeably grainy and, because it is fullscreen, it just looks lame.

249,paulywanna,A simple crit.,10,22 March 2003,"This crime comedy is set in the late '30s and is captivating right through to the end. The viewer is held by the clever plot layout and several twists, which make the 1973 film worth watching today. Robert Redford and Paul Newman team up and make a great partnership in crime. The film is historically stylized and the images work together with the Scott Joplin's piano rags to make a fun and contiguous whole. The film is logical and linear and very easy to watch, which makes it all the more engaging. The viewer can then concentrate on the complete story and see exactly how `The Sting' takes place.  We enjoy the ride as we watch Doyle Lonnegan (Robert Shaw) get conned. I thoroughly enjoyed this movie for the simple fact that it was fun and entertaining. I love the brilliant twists.

One day Johnny and his band unknowingly con a man running money for the vindictive, Irish, mob-boss Doyle Lonnegan(Robert Shaw). Presently a member of the band is found dead and Johnny flees to Chicago where he teams up with the legendary Henry Gondorff(Paul Newman) to sting Lonnegan and so avenge his friend.Redford's performance wavers from mediocre to superb. But where Redford fails, Newman pulls of what must be his best performance(judging by the movies with him I have seen thus far). Newman and Shaw's acting against each other is magnificently tensioned and provides for much comical relief.Except for the occasional sloppy filming and inconsistency in lighting, the movie maintains a strong cinematic language that artistically conveys a recreation of 30's cinema - using wipes between shots, chapter cards between acts and other such eccentricities.Besides the enticing world of con artists, what carries this movie and makes it so effectively entertaining is the plot construction and twists. It is very fitting for a movie dealing with deceit to be so deceitful with its viewers; for we are subjected to parallel story lines, when intertwined, throw our conceptions around and lies are revealed to be disguised as truth.Simply as good as a movie in this genre can get!",The Sting

Performances to die for, by Robert Redford, Paul Newman and Robert Shaw at his best, together with all the essential ingredients,such as stunning cinematography, enhanced by a fantastic sound track, complimenting both the music and effects elements combined. Art direction is superb and wardrobe and make-up are intriguing...the net result produces hugely entertaining and fascinating cinema! A movie that could be enjoyed over and over again...now I have the DVD I will certainly regard it as an all time favourite!",The Sting
254,colbhoy,Superb,10,6 August 2006,"This is just a superb film. The performances from Redford, Newman and Shaw in particular are outstanding and they are ably supported by an excellent supporting cast. This is not an easy film to follow, there are a lot of characters and a fairly intricate plot so repeat viewing is essential.The score is amazing as is the portrayal of 1930's Chicago. The best scene in my opinion is that set on the New York to Chicago train where Gondorff (Newman) first meets Lonnegan (Shaw) over the poker game and ""sets up"" the Sting. The suppressed rage that Lonnegan portrays is brilliant as Gondorff outwits him time and time again by ""cheating better than him"".This is a film well worthy of a Best Picture Oscar.",The Sting

256,cynthia-flynn,"a caper, so well acted, so well written...you'll see",10,7 May 2010,"The pair was younger when they first hit movie gold together but never better as Paul Newman and Robert Redford head a tremendous cast in a story that deserves them. From the first glimpse of Newman, the phrase growing old gracefully lets you know he won't be outrunning anybody like his younger partner. The older trusting conman goes for one more for the sake of an old friend's widow. The set up roles out a cast of characters until the good guys and the bad guys get a complicated enough story going that you begin to believe, and it breaks your heart. But the cast, oh that cast, the secret signal, the costumes, the accents, the props and the girls on the carousel. Eileen Brennan is a gem, Harold Gould so perfect and Robert Shaw so hateful. Paul Newman was one of the greats of American film, so good looking he really had a lot to prove before he was taken seriously. But then we found he had stopped taking himself so seriously, just his craft and the other things he believed in. That is what makes this movie so darn good, it is why people went to the movies during the depression. They left happier than when they went in, I sure did. This is the perfect movie for our bad economic times. Download it, rent it, buy it, but enjoy.",The Sting

261,duganfry,Outstanding film,10,17 September 2006,"There's nothing but pure praise from me on this movie. It's a classic and I swear, whenever it's on television, I'll watch it over and over.My favorite scene (like the rest of you) - The train scene card game is pure classic. How many of us would LOVE to be in the roll of Paul Newmann (Henry Gondorff) when he walks into the poker game as though he's so drunk that he makes himself look like an easy mark for Lonigon's cheating. Hey, don't forget Gondorf's smart ass cocky smiley attitude after taking the rest of these goofs to the cleaners. Hysterically funny. You're laughing your butt off like your Gondorff yourself but you can understand why the rest of these guys would be completely p.o. at him.The last part of the train scene, of course, where Lonigon (Robert Shaw's character) thinks he's out-conned Gondorf has us all fooled. Who would have thunk Gondorf would throw down jacks to beat Lonigon's hand AFTER LONIGAN STACKED THE CARDS AGAIN! Priceless. Shaw played Lonigon so well, you swear you can almost see the steam coming out of his ears. That was so dang funny. Whoever wrote the whole card game train scene should have gone home with the Oscar.Shaw was great in this scene but nobody could have pulled off Gondorf's card game con like Newmann. Newman's eyes and expressions are the selling point of this scene. You don't need words when you can read everything in this scene in both of their eyes and expressions.THAT IS PURE GREAT ACTING FOLKS!",The Sting

263,bhwest,Seeing it on DVD is like having Hamlet read in English class by a bunch of bored teenagers!,10,25 June 2016,"When we were first married in the early 1970's and living near Chicago, we would treat ourselves to two days worth of first run movies in the downtown movie palaces/theaters and stay over night in a ""nice"" hotel between Christmas and New Years Eve! We wandered into the tiny Loop Theatre shoved up next to the palatial Chicago Theatre simply because it was very cold and we didn't want to wait an hour for the movie to start again at the Chicago. So we said, what the hell, lets see whatever is playing at the Loop Theatre next door. At least it will be warm and since it is downtown, how bad can it be?That was the greatest understatement of our marital history of now 45 years. We bought two of the few remaining tickets side-by-side and sat down just as the Scott Joplin rag, ""The Entertainer"" started up slowly.The ending was the most electric experience we have ever experienced as movie goers/addicts! It was the only movie we payed twice for and got in line again as the theater was filling up for the 9pm showing. We wanted to watch it again since we now knew the ending AND since it wasn't until after the first sting had played out on a street in Joliet that we began to realize that we may have struck a home run by accident!We took my mother to see it several weeks later for a 3rd time (but 1st time for her). The ending fell flat simply because we were in a movie house next to a shopping mall that was only about 20% full and I suspect that at least 90% of that 20% were second time viewers or even third, like we were.Newman and Redford never made another movie together since how could they improve on perfection? It was Marilyn Monroe in ""Some Like it Hot!"" Chicago during the gritty 1930's is the classic part and the movie is the classic example of how a superb movie can be transposed into a classic movie simply by adding a classic music score from a rejiggered timeless composer.Don't watch ""The Sting"" at home. Invite the neighborhood in for popcorn and beer and maybe you will be lucky to have a good percentage who have never seen it!

266,fetreis,Speaking of amdmiration,10,3 March 2004,"This is by far and away one of my favorite movies.  Aside from all of that top 100 ranking nonsense this is one of the richest, genuine forms of film. The casting is simply perfect.  Hill's direction along with the impact of a witty, thoughtful script make this a movie admirable throughout the ages. The poker scene on the train with the exchanges between Lonnegan and Gondorff is worth seeing by itself.  The soundtrack makes the movie as well, and one of my favorite parts is at the end when Redford and Newman exchange glances and head out after the con is played while ""the entertainer"" starts up slowly in the background.  In a way i think its unfair that Redford hasnt been more decorated by the academy or his peers.  I think because of the fact that he is so picky with his roles that critics to tend to over analyze him.  With that said I still think Redford should have one his best actor award that he was nominated for that year.  Redford absolutely nailed the Hooker character and his ability to convincingly play both sides between Lonnegan and Gondorff certainly had me fooled the first time i saw the movie.  But there is no question that Redford's character was made better by Paul Newman.  The two playing off each other is classic and i think Paul Newman was grossly overlooked for his role as Gondorff.  Unfortunatly Newman is so talented that i think we tend to take for granted his greatness. Robert Shaw as Doyle could argued as the best character in the movie.  His mannerisms and style make you want to see him get conned.  But its the subtle things about the character that Shaw hits perfectly.  Such as the way that if you look at his face during the poker scene you see the growing distaste for Gondorff.  Or the fact that he only smiles twice in the movie (when he boasts 4 nines and when he tells of putting the 1/2 million on lucky dan) both times he gets conned!  The rest of the cast rounds out well, my personal favorite being Kid Twist.  His scenes with Redford while they string Lonnegan along are believeable even though Doyle is skeptical of the operation.  A movie like this simply captures a persons attention and for that reason The Sting will always be a movie to admire...",The Sting

I knew the hype surrounding it (the seven Oscars and all the Critics lists) and I must say that this movie actually lived up to all of the hype.It might be that I love period pieces, or that I think Paul Newman is one of the best (and best looking) actors to ever hit the screen. The chemistry between Redford and Newman in this movie was absolutely fantastic. It worked also in Butch Cassidy. I know most people don't like this movie because it's a bit outdated. There are no cool effects, no car chases, nothing to wow the viewers visually. The script and acting more than make up for the lack of effects. This movie is definitely on my top ten list.

I finally rented it a few years back and was very delighted by the film. It is a bit long, but interesting. With most movies I watch, I attempt to guess at the ending and more than not I am correct and disappointed that it was so clear. In this film I had no idea what was happening and the ending caught me totally off guard which makes it even better in my opinion. It also has some really great music in it.

Time went on and I had forgotten about the film, but I've subsequently become a big fan of 60's and 70's films and I finally wanted to see 'The Sting' and looked forward to it when I got Netflix.I thought to myself, this is gonna' be great. Is it going to be like a harder edged 'Paper Moon', a 1930's version of 'The French Connection'? A film noir made in the 70's, done right? Alas no. I thought it very cheesy overall. Overdone cartoonish costumes and props, very fake looking back lot sets, forced stilted dialog.

Now, I'm not saying it was a bad movie or anything because I feel i did enjoy it in many parts. I feel it just need to be short and sweet. Instead it was dragged out and sort of repeating the same plot the whole movie. Another thing that bothers me about these movies is how under developed we were back in that time. I just think of how the females are lesser and seen as like romantic pawns in these movies. It make me a little uncomfortable. But all in all this movie wasn't the worst.

The plot is absorbing and so cleverly put together that watching just once is not enough. I've just read a previous comment that perhaps Robert Shaw was not a good choice for the role of Doyle Lonnegan, I could not disagree more! He was a fine actor that could slip into character and always gave a superb performance. Newman and Redford are simply perfect for this film, they both complimented each others characters and left you with the impression that even though their characters had only just met they genuinely liked each other. This was the con of a lifetime that Newman, aka Shaw, had been waiting for and you could tell it was the Big One for him and he was going to pull something special out of the bag to sting Lonnegan. And I defy anyone not to laugh at the scene on the train, the Poker game, where he 'hooks' Lonnegan, it was true comedy brilliance - pretending to be drunk, calling Lonnegan Linnerman/Lonnerman etc, then beating him.

288,kur-02608,OK but,8,10 April 2015,"That must have been tough for the Academy voters because to single out Redford as opposed to Paul Newman must have felt a bit unjust. For though Newman was nominated many times over his career and finally did win for The Color of Money, did not get a nomination for The Sting.Robert Redford is a small time grifter who while working a bait and switch street con takes off a numbers runner carrying the weekly take. The orders come down from the head man himself, Irish-American gangster Robert Shaw to kill those who did this as an example.Redford's mentor, Robert Earl Jones, is in fact killed, mainly because Redford starts spending a lot of that newly acquired loot that tips them off. Redford wants revenge so he looks up big time con man Paul Newman who himself is dodging law enforcement as is Redford also.They work the big con on Shaw and it's a beauty. The scheme they have is something to behold. They also have to do a couple of improvisations on the fly that lend a few twists to the scheme.The costumes and sets really do evoke Chicago of the Thirties and director George Roy Hill assembles a great cast to support Newman and Redford. My favorite in the whole group is Charles Durning, who plays the brutally corrupt, but essentially dumb cop from Joliet who nearly gums up the works and has to be dealt with.Special mention should also go to Robert Shaw. He's got a difficult part, maybe the most difficult in the film. He's not stupid, he would not have gotten to the top of the rackets if he was. But he also has to show that hint of human weakness that Newman, Redford, and the whole mob they assemble that makes him vulnerable to the con.During the sixties and seventies Robert Shaw was really coming into his own as a player, getting more and more acclaim for his work. His early death was a real tragedy, there was so much more he could have been doing.Can't also forget another co-star in this film, the ragtime music of Scott Joplin that was used to score The Sting. It probably is what most people remember about The Sting. Music from the Theodore Roosevelt era, scoring a film set in the Franklin Roosevelt era made while Nixon was president.

291,potterfan9791,not good at all.,1,18 January 2011,"this movie is so bad. i really don't like the story or acting. it's overrated in my humble opinion and makes people fall asleep. watch the social network instead. this movie just makes no sense because it talks about things that are boring and not fun. i wouldn't recommend watching it at all. sometimes i wanna fall asleep so bad that i have nightmares i am still awake. the only interesting part was the naked woman at the beginning. if there was more of that this could deserve a two star review. but even that can't make me love it. it's one of those movies you have to be crazy to enjoy. the part where they steal the money is predictable and dumb. i've seen barney produce better feature films. have you ever seen the count of Monte cristo? this is WORSE. can you imagine? stay away, stay far far away.",The Sting
292,dbondu-1,Love that Gondorff (sp?),10,12 March 2006,"My absolute favorite part of the Sting is the way they take care of the perisitent cop who tails RR to the big city and sticks to him for the duration of the movie. LOve the denouement when the FBI guy is one of the con artists.I am sure we can assemble a willing group of FBI, CIA, IRS, BATF agents who ARENOT on the TAKE. Time to go knocking on some BIG doors, doncha think? Lord have mercy, the trouble boys can get into. Good thing they have really SMART female lawyers to get them out of hot water...well...kinda.And pretty soon, we need to change the venue of the horse race to the STOCK MARKET. Mr. Greenspan needs to puke like he's been on Mr. Toad's wild ride. And a WHOLE BUNCH OF OTHER BANKERS. Round them up. CITIBANK, MBNA and RIGGS should be high on the hit parade. The TOP 3.Is there enough silver to go around for the good guys? Each good guy will have a silver bullion 1 oz coin (not a freaking badge).Be creative. I'm sure you will have no problem in that arena.And hell, if I don;t go take a shower I'm gonna start to stink! Napster is gonna go get wet.Back in a few.",The Sting
293,thesevr,Best Movie Ever,10,19 March 2006,"okay, okay, you don't agree with the heading of best movie ever. however, consider this: this movie has all the ingredients to qualify.,2 of the greatest screen stars, with an awesome supporting cast, a plot that keeps the view totally interested until a very surprising ending, scenery and wardrobe that puts you right into that era, and to top it all off, how could you not love the Scott Joplin, ragtime music performed by Marvin Hamlisch? this is the total feel-good movie that you just cant resist. its not very often you come across a movie where everything hits on all cylinder's, and i know some people might not put this in the Citizen Kane category, but all in all if a movie is for entertainment value, then this a true 10..again, best movie ever!!",The Sting
294,miniminime5,Brilliant,10,29 March 2006,"This is one of the best films ever made. This film is just quality with all its twists and turns it is the best classic ever.Robert Redford does some marvellous pieces of acting.This could go up against any modern day film and beat it. When I first heard about it I thought it was going to be dull and boring but it proved me wrong.It was made in 1973 which put me of it but trust me when you watch it your eyes will be glued to it.The director, actors and cast deserve to be put in the hall of fame for this one. 10/10 5/5 Amazing. The only other director to direct a film better than this is Ridley Scott. This film is suitable for 10-90 year old aged people in my opinion.",The Sting
