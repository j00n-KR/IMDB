0,SnoopyStyle,memberberries,6,1 September 2017,"Inspired by the Bre-X scandal, it's 1988 Reno. Hard drinking Kenny Wells (Matthew McConaughey) and girlfriend Kay (Bryce Dallas Howard) are struggling. He's a lifelong wildcat prospector working for his respected father until his sudden death. With nothing left in business, he goes to Indonesia and connects with geologist Michael Acosta (Édgar Ramírez) who has a revolutionary theory. They head into the jungle and become gold mining legends.I do remember Bre-X. Some of it came back to me along with the movie. I remember one of the reporters telling the story of a souvenir core sample. They handed out samples to reporters and investors. As the scandal broke, they went back to test those samples. I think there is a missing character. It needs an investigative reporter who uncovers the scandal. Kenny and Kay's breakup seems abrupt. The second half seems a bit rushed although the two hour running time probably forced some cutting. McConaughey may be trying too hard shooting for an award. There is a compelling character story here if not fully realized as a thriller.",Gold
1,boblipton,Inspired By a True Story: There is a Country called Indonesia,6,29 January 2017,"I didn't follow the Bre-X scandal in detail when it broke in 1997. The first I heard of it was when their geologist fell from a helicopter. As the news came out and the massive reserves of gold vanished like fairy gold, it didn't affect me, since I avoid junior miners (exploration) and certainly try to avoid Indonesia; although my ban has continued out of habit and inability to figure the stock market there, back then the nation was run by Suharto for personal gain, and was famous for setting up cartels -- and busting them for its own profit. It isn't just caveat emptor. It's don't empt at all.So when Matthew McConaughey shows up in this one, bald and with a paunch, it was clear to me that he wished he had been in American Hustle. Naturally the names, nations and stock exchanges are changed to protect the guilty. Although it annoys the heck out of me whenever a movie comes out ""Inspired by true facts"" and every detail has been changed (Newmont Mining is referred to by name early on; later, when the company turns villainous, it becomes ""Newmark Mining"", and in any case, it was Barrick in reality; Bre-X was never on the NYSE, but it was on the Toronto Exchange, etc. etc.). Nonetheless, if you accept the fact that these guys pulled a fraud on the stock-buying public, and it's the analysts' fault because they shouldn't have been hoodwinked, it's an entertaining movie.",Gold
2,Horst_In_Translation,"This film may not be a nugget, but it's worth watching if you don't have to dig too deep",6,4 May 2017,"""Gold"" is an American movie in the English language from 2016 and the most recent directorial effort by Oscar-winning writer Stephan Gaghan. He was not in charge of the screenplay this time, but the script is by Emmy nominees Massett and Zinman. It runs for pretty much two hours exactly and Oscar-winning actor Matthew McConaughey is basically in every scene during these 120 minutes. I must say I enjoyed the watch pretty much, even if the formula behind the film is more simple than it may seem. It's basically all about the ups and downs of the protagonist. Up#1: He is having a great job at a prestigious prospector mostly thanks to his dad. Down#1: His dad is dead and he is low on money not finding any investors. Up#2: He reunites with a partner in an attempt to find gold. Down#2: He suffers from malaria and the workers leave. Up#3: The workers return, they find gold and he is healthy again. Down#3: A rich company uses its political connections to ""steal"" all the gold. Up#4: With the help of a politician's son, he manages to get the gold back and also receives a prestigious award. Down#4: It all proves to be a scam and the protagonist is a victim just like everybody else, except his partner. Up#5: The fact that there will be no criminal proceedings apparently and the final letter.So yeah, it's a roller coaster of emotions for McConaughey's character here and he gives a pretty strong performance that is deserving of awards attention too, though probably not as much as his Oscar-winning turn because the subject is also not really that significant by today's standards. As for the story, there may have been one or two plot twists too many eventually, but it's okay if you don't really look for extremely great depth or so. Not that there isn't any, but the film is at times just a bit for the sake of it and may take itself a tad too seriously. There are some comedy moments too with everything about the protagonist like the yellow roses scene. But McConaughey plays a really likable character I think and especially his private life when it comes to romance depicts him as somebody worth cheering for. He is dedicated, his name means more to him than money and he is also not scared of hard labor to reach his goals. The wrong decisions he makes perhaps really only result from people next to him that have a negative impact on him like the promiscuous journalist woman or Stoll's character. It's maybe accurate to describe the central character as a mix of a raccoon and King Midas in this story. I also think the last shot is really interesting as you can still debate if he was in it the whole time or just got lucky with his former partner sending him half of the money. Of course, he will not give it back, but at that point, if he wasn't in on it all the time, you like the character enough that you won't blame him for it. The film may not make a powerful statement on greed (like TWBB for example) even if it really wants to, but that's fine as it succeeds sufficiently in other areas instead, maybe even some where it did not really try to.Anyway, after talking so much about McConaughey's character, let's also say a few words about Edgar Ramirez (""Carlos""). I quite like him and I think he did a great job with the character. This was pretty tough as his character makes pretty much the biggest waves when he is visually out of the picture, namely in the last 20 minutes, but I think Ramirez holds his own very well next to McConaughey despite not having great material to work with at all. And that means quite something as McConaughey's transformation from weak cheesy romance movie actor to one of Hollywood's finest is something that cannot be denied. Also some good supporting players in here like Keach and Nelson and even the annoying one from ""Veep"" was somewhat bearable here. Eventually, I would not say it is one of the best films of the year, but still worth checking out, especially if you like Matthew McConaughey. It is somewhat true that these days you cannot really go wrong with him. Alright, alright, alright, watch it!",Gold
3,kosmasp,"All that shines ... no wait, that's not it",8,5 August 2017,"Based on a real story and what a story it is. It's about the pitfalls of working hard for your success, but while focusing on the big picture forgetting about smaller details. And it's being made clear early on in the movie, that something will happen. And still the attention the movie demands is high. It's not like you will outright know where this is going (unless you know the original story that is of course).Matthew is playing Gold league in this (no pun intended). His performance is central, because you have to feel the urge and determination the character feels. You may not always understand his motives or why he keeps on chasing that dream. But that's character trait for you. Being focused on one thing can easily be called a negative thing. If you can't see anything else around it. Of course, if you are fixated that will happen eventually, but not until you either achieve what you set out to do or crash very badly. Or maybe both? Well that's for you to find out, if you like your drama slow paced and unnerving, but as gripping as it gets",Gold
4,blanche-2,loosely based on a true story of unmitigated greed,6,27 August 2017,"Matthew McConaughey, Edward Ramirez and Bryce Dallas Howard star in ""Gold"" from 2016, based on the Bre-X gold mine scandal in Canada.After his father dies and the fourth-generation prospecting business goes belly-up, Kenny Wells (McConaughey) does not want to give up on his dream of finding gold in them thar hills.He approaches a well-known geologist, Michael Acosta (Ramirez) and talks him into partnering with him. Michael hasn't found gold either but thinks he knows where in Indonesia to look. Wells manages to get a few investors and the two go to work, but without luck. It's looking like another failure, especially when the workers quit. Knowing they need fresh water in their community, Michael lures them back to work by providing purifying systems for them.Wells contracts malaria and is out of it for weeks. But when he is well, he learns that Michael has found gold. Their subsequent success is enormous.This is one of those pathetic stories we've seen and heard about a million times - Enron, Madoff, etc., etc., where no one questions anything because -- as Wells says at the end -- everyone is making too much money. This to me was one of the more outrageous stories. It's amazing to me that enormous corporations will buy into anything, no matter how stupid, if they think they can make a few dollars.The film is entertaining, with McConaughey a vision with his shaved head, 45-pound weight gain and false teeth, giving a fine performance as a man who looks like a loser and kind of acts like one. Ramirez is subtle and underplayed, in good contrast to the bombastic Kenny.Nice ending.",Gold
5,LeonLouisRicci,Not an Easy Movie to Enjoy...Movement Without Rhythym & Repulsive,5,24 May 2017,"There is No Real Reasonable Explanation Why the Lead Character (Matthew Mcconaughey) needed to be so Repulsive Looking, or for that matter, Smoke like a Stack and Swill Endless Drinks of Alcohol.It's a Boring Movie despite the Rah-Rah and the Tonal Shifts are Irritating. The Stakes Involved (billions of dollars) and the Infringements on the Ownership of Labor are Barely made Interesting.The Film's Style and Thesis are a Modern Trend and this one is Evidence of an Evisceration of a Theme that has been Stripped Mined and Played Out.A Good Cast can't Keep Up with Mcconaughey's Antics of Sweaty Enthusiasm Strutting around in His Underwear and Spazzing about like the Tasmanian Devil.Worth a Watch, but just Barely and only to Spot the Cameos, Ogle the Beauty of Bryce Dallas Howard, and to see what the 2016 Version of an Oscar Baiting Performance can Look Like (it's not a pretty sight).",Gold
6,neil-476,Not very engaging,6,15 May 2018,"Heavy smoker and prospector Kenny Wells teams up with Mike Acosta and when they find gold, Kenny runs the risk of being outsmarted by big business.Inspired by a true story (it says here), Matthew McConaughey undergoes a physical transformation every bit as comprehensive as the one in his Oscar-winning Dallas Buyers Club performance. I don't think he will be getting an Oscar for this one, though - it is seriously hammy. McConaughey can do subtle, but does not do so here. He appears to be having fun, but in the same way someone playing the villain in panto has fun.The story is quite a good one - the search for gold, the things in Kenny's make-up which drive him, the scheming and plotting and serial outwitting which goes on once the find is established, and the twisty resolutions to the tale - but the telling of it is dragged out a little too long. It's a bit of a puzzle, because there are some extremely good directorial touches, but something in the telling is distinctly off. The film should have been much better than it is.The best thing in it, in my view, is Bryce Dallas Howard as Kenny's wife, who doesn't actually want the things which drive Kenny. Hers is a performance of touching and understated emotion, and a likeable character in the middle of a cast of characters who are largely fairly repellent.There are some good things in this movie, but I can't honestly recommend it.",Gold
7,ferguson-6,all that glitters and jitters,6,26 January 2017,"Greetings again from the darkness. What is your dream worth? Would you sell it? How much would it take? Kenny Wells is a dreamer. Sure, he is a third generation mining prospector, but he'd rather tell you the story of his grandfather and those mules than actually dig in the dirt himself. In fact, talking is what he does best (and most often). It's the first film from director Stephen Gaghan since his 2005 Syriana, for which he received an Oscar nomination for his screenplay. This time he collaborates with writers Patrick Massett and John Zinman to deliver a blend of The Wolf of Wall Street and The Treasure of the Sierra Madre, with a dash of The Big Short and American Hustle.Matthew McConaughey is nearly over-the-top in his portrayal of Kenny Wells, a prospector with the spirit of a wildcatter. This isn't 'sexiest man alive' McConaughey, but rather ghastly Matthew. Balding dome, protruding gut, and hillbilly teeth  it's all there wrapped in a sweaty cheap suit and accessorized with booze and cigarettes. The actor seems to relish the role.The story kicks off in 1981 Reno, showing Kenny as an eager to please son to his distinguished father played by Craig T Nelson. Flash forward to 1988 and Kenny's struggling through the recession in an effort to keep his dad's company alive. His loyal employees work the phones from the musty cocktail lounge where Kenny's girlfriend Kay (Bryce Dallas Howard) waits tables.Billed as ""inspired by true events"", Kenny goes to great extremes to meet up with legendary geologist and miner Mike Acosta (played by Edgar Ramirez). These two need each other and team up to sniff out a gold mine down the river in Indonesia. What follows is despair, desperation, malaria, elation, big investment bankers, a hostile takeover attempt, political maneuverings, heartbreak, pride, and a surprising twist. It's a wild ride and doesn't always take you where you assume it's headed.The supporting cast includes Corey Stoll and Bill Camp as part of the Wall Street investment group, Stacy Keach as a supporter and investor of Wells, Toby Kebbell as an FBI agent, and Rachael Taylor as a contrast to Bryce Dallas Howard's working class character. Also appearing is Bruce Greenwood as the king of the prospector hill and featuring an awful accent that adds to the borderline cartoon feel of some scenes.Hope and greed could be viewed as a disease, but for Kenny Wells, we are urged to believe it's all about the dream. What's left if you sell off that dream? Instead, if you aren't part of the fraud, maybe you live for that moment on stage when they present you the Golden Pick Axe award, and you finally believe your father would respect you. Iggy Pop and Danger Mouse collaborate on an included song, which somehow fit in with the string of 1980's music that plays throughout. The rapid and numerous changes of direction will keep you entertained, though we do wonder how much truth from the Bre-X scandal was actually used, and how much was just a chance for McConaughey to go all out.",Gold
8,bombersflyup,Such a cold finger / Beckons you to enter his web of sin,8,19 July 2018,"Gold is a good film, with an engaging real story.A good story told well. McConaughey and Ramirez both excellent in their roles. Consistently good music throughout, I recall bopping along having never heard any of it before.

9,deloudelouvain,Gold fever!,7,10 April 2017,"Story based on true events, that alone makes it more interesting to watch for me. Add on that that my wife is from Reno, Nevada and that she knows a couple of Wells families from when she was young and you get a movie that will get my attention. But that's not a guarantee it will be a good movie. But it was, with strong acting from Matthew McConaughey as Kenny Wells the main character in Gold. Sometimes it gets a bit complicated with all those bank terms but you get the point even if you are like me not interested at all in that kind of business. The story has a couple huge twists that you don't see coming and that's a good thing. If half of this story is true I can imagine the devastation it will have made in some families at that time. Good acting with a solid story, certainly worth a watch.",Gold
10,Hellmant,"Slightly amusing, but also slightly a bore.",7,1 February 2017,"'GOLD': Three and a Half Stars (Out of Five)A crime-drama-adventure about a desperate businessman, who teams with a geologist to find gold in the jungles of Indonesia. It's based on a true story, from 1993. The film was directed by Stephen Gaghan (who also helmed 2005's 'SYRIANA'), and it was written by Patrick Massett and John Zinman (two veteran TV writers). The movie stars Matthew McConaughey, Edgar Ramirez, Bryce Dallas Howard, Corey Stoll, Stacy Keach, Bruce Greenwood and Toby Kebbell. It's received mostly negative reviews from critics, and it's also been a disappointment at the Box Office. I found it to be slightly amusing, but it's also slightly a bore. Kenny Wells (McConaughey) was an unlucky businessman, who always dreamed of finding gold. He tracked down a geologist, by the name of Michael Acosta (Ramirez), and talked him into going into business with him. The two then traveled deep into the jungles of Borneo, to look for gold together. They're adventure became a huge story in 1993.The movie starts out interesting, and it ends interesting as well. It's not always involving, or entertaining, in-between though. The performances are all decent, especially McConaughey (who always gives 110 percent), and it's always nice to look at also. I definitely wouldn't say it's a waste of time, or anything like that, but it's also nothing special either. It's not as bad as the bad reviews make it out to be though.Watch our movie review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1M9osPwjfbM",Gold

12,Pjtaylor-96-138044,"It doesn't quite strike gold, but it's fun to watch it try.",6,14 July 2018,"'Gold (2016)' falls firmly into the category of bio-pics that favour a fast-pace and 'cool' façade, the ones that stick their big star into a quite unglamorous real-life role and have them narrate their way through a pretty predictable rags-to-riches (and usually back to rags again) plot. While it certainly isn't up to the gold standard of such features, it doesn't have a hard time grabbing its bronze-tier medal and holding onto it with both hands. Beneath the exact same aesthetic and overall presentation is a decent story, one which does surprise in a few key places and actually provides a sturdy vehicle for its leading man to ride about with wheel-spinning glee. It's usually entertaining enough to warrant its existence and also has the benefit of not being a prolific enough headline to come with expectations, in terms of its general plot and its actual journalistic integrity. It doesn't quite strike gold, but it's fairly fun to watch it try. 6/10.",Gold

Kenny Wells (McConaughey) is a prospector struggling to survive. After being turned down from everyone he decides to risk it all on a dig in Indonesia. He enlists help from Michael Acosta (Ramírez) and together the two find one of the biggest gold mines in history. The two soon realize that finding the gold was the easy part, what happened next was the real struggle. This is a movie where expectations played a huge part in how I felt about it. I went in, without watching a preview, thinking it was going to be like an Indiana Jones action movie, and it was not. The movie did have some interesting aspects and the end was great, but the movie really, really, really drug throughout to the point of me losing interest a few times. McConaughey really transformed for this role and he was good but the pacing really hurt this movie quite a bit. Overall, a decent movie with a good story but just a little too slow to get fully involved in. I give this a B-.",Gold
14,capone666,The Vidiot Reviews...,6,30 April 2017,"GoldThe worst part of gold digging is that you to have to spank an 80-year-old ass.Fortunately, this drama is about prospecting, not sleeping with the elderly.Kenny's (Matthew McConaughey) an ineffective entrepreneur who tries his hand at mining. Partnering with a geologist (Édgar Ramírez) the two raise enough capital to fund a dig in Indonesia. Initially unsuccessful, they eventual strike a vein that sends Wall Street into a tizzy.With investors and governments now onboard, Kenny finally gets the notoriety he craves. But a ploy by his partner could put their entire deposit in jeopardy.A loose adaptation of the 1993 Canadian mining company sandal that rocked the industry, this well-acted yet highly fictional account of Bre-X not only Americanizes the Canuck content, but it also dumbs down the material with its derivative crime-drama script.However, when Canadians do strike it rich, they tend to pimp out their igloos.

15,Reno-Rangan,Treasure hunt meets the wall street!,8,4 November 2017,"Loosely based on the real. It's both a treasure hunt film, and a wall street tale. The great mix of two made it a fine film. Wall street based films always fascinates the grown-ups. So do this film. Matthew McConaughey playing in one of two main role, I thought it should have been called 'Fool's Gold 2'. You will know why I said that once you watch it, or maybe you know it already. But the end twist was something different, changed everything.The man who inherited the family business of mining, is now in the crisis of losing everything. His final move is to join the hand with another man struggling as same as he is. They both pull off successfully the initial hiccup. And after a long struggle, seems they had hit a bullseye. The lives have changed forever or is it! Another trouble follows them, following, the story reaches the end with a twist.At first, I thought it was like in the line of 'There Will Be Blood'. As the narration progresses, the gear changed between the two worlds. One being in the US and then in Indonesian Jungle. I thought the end should have been little more detail, but it still worked fine.An underrated film for sure. If it was a DiCaprio film, it would have been highly praised.Actually, I liked it. Well written screenplay and performances. Matthew McConaughey was awesome. We talk about actor like Johnny Depp for playing roles in awesome costumes, but this guy turned the roles to reality. It's either 'Dallas Buyer's Club' or this or any others. He deserves well respect more the big names right now. Thousand times better than accidental actor, DiCaprio.Edgar Ramirez was also good. Bryce Dallas Howard had an important role as well. Overall, This is one of the films not to miss from the 2016 calender. It could have been a box office bomb, but definitely will be recognised as the time pass by. I would surely suggest it to anybody.8/10",Gold

The direction which was made by Stephen Gaghan, it was good and he did an excellent job on creating us the same feelings of his main characters such as desperation and anger. Both the interpretations of Matthew McConaughey who played as Kenny Wells and Edgar Ramírez who played as Michael Acosta, were very good and I believe that the combination of these actors was an excellent choice for their parts.

17,Floated2,True based story but content lacking,5,26 July 2019,"Loosely based on a true story and true events, Gold is an intriguing little drama about greed, upbringings and ultimately luck. Matthew McConaughey gives a very good performance but it is clear the studios and people involved in this film expected this film (and his role) to garnish Oscar nominations/wins.

18,eddie_baggins,Another notable McConaughey turn can't save this drama,6,14 June 2017,"A few years ago a performance like the one Matthew McConaughey delivers here in Stephen Gaghan's based on a true tale Gold would've created quite a stir.It's a credit to the actor, who resurrected his career from the doldrums of so-so romcoms, Surfer Dudes and other forgettable affairs to all of a sudden become an Oscar winning and HBO headlining legend but with that career revival has come an expectation that McConaughey going method and fully inhabiting his characters is the normal and therefore less of an event that it was, a mere few years ago.No more so evident than in the fact Gold came and disappeared with very little fanfare in the awards season rush at the end of 2016, McConaughey chewing up the scenery wasn't enough to draw people into the cinemas, as the beer bellied, hair thinning and sweaty thespian found himself being the best thing about a so-so film that never feels completely assured of itself.Telling the rather complex story of struggling 1980's American prospector/mining magnate Kenny Wells, who found fame and wealth by teaming up with prospecting master Michael Acosta in the jungles of Indonesia, Syriana director and Traffic screenwriter Stephen Gaghan never pieces together the many various elements of Well's story into a satisfactory whole as events come and go and Well's journey takes its twists and turns.As is with any film in the vein of Gold, it's always a fine balance for a filmmaker to strike the perfect line between pandering to an audience or keeping them in the dark and unfortunately for Gold there ends up being too many times where we're left in the lurch a little by the plights affecting Well's while some scenes in the film that feel hugely important to the whole scheme of things, often feel underutilised or passed over which leaves the trials and adversities of this American mogul emotionally unengaging.What can't be denied in the film however is the aforementioned work of McConaughey, who's a joy to watch as Wells, the car crash waiting to happen.In a loaded cast that includes an underused Bryce Dallas Howard as Well's long-suffering girlfriend Kay, Edgar Ramirez as Acosta, Corey Stoll as Wall Street player Brian Woolf and Toby (needs a new agent) Kebbell as FBI investigator Paul Jennings, McConaughey stands head and shoulders above the rest and while its far from his best turn over recent years, it's a quality actor that can deliver such above average performances on cue, as McConaughey does here.Sometimes clad in nothing more than some worn-out white underpants or looking dishevelled beyond belief, McConaughey's turn as Well's deserves a better film and showcases what might've been for Gold had it managed to match the chaotic nature of its main character and the commitment of its on form leading man.Final say – Digging up another memorable McConaughey turn, Gold doesn't strike it rich due to tonal issues and a lack of emotional engagement but Gaghan's slightly disappointing film is still an often intriguing true story made all the better by the work of its leading man.3 pot bellies out of 5",Gold
19,TheMovieDiorama,Gold occasionally glitters but is weighted by the dullness of mud.,6,24 February 2018,"An overused and tired formula, oh you know the one: ""main character starts with nothing, soon earns everything and then loses it all"". An extremely saturated trope where any new additions really need to standout. Unfortunately for Gold, it was too safe and uninteresting. Kenny Wells desires to become a prospector and run his own mining company, to which he sets off out to Indonesia to strike gold (quite literally...). All seems to be going well until major companies want a piece of the action where Kenny may gain even more money or lose it all. It's not often a biopic makes me feel conflicted, it's actually a genre I really appreciate and enjoy. An intriguing scandal brought to the big screen with safe directing, safe dialogue and a safe supporting cast. Everything about this felt safe, and ultimately that is its downfall. It becomes uninteresting, dull and actually rather ugly. Matthew McConaughey gives a committed performance and probably one of his better roles, just behind 'Dallas Buyers Club'. I'm still not a huge fan, but his method style of acting is unquestionably devoted. Edgar Ramirez certainly looked the part, same goes to Corey Stoll. But the supporting cast were wasted. Bland, uncharismatic and simply just a vehicle to boost McConaughey's performance. The jungles of Indonesia looked lavish and luscious. The third act alone saved this from being a mediocre borefest. It just hooked me immediately and I couldn't take my eyes off. A shame that the rest of the film couldn't maintain that sense of tension and grip. The story was just ugly. The greed of man, constantly revolving around money, business and stock. Unlikeable. Gold is just fine, I wasn't bored yet I wasn't entertained either. McConaughey and the third act just about push this to be classed as ""good"". Wouldn't watch it again in a hurry...",Gold
20,paul-allaer,So-so crime/treasure hunt movie fails to connect,5,29 January 2017,"""Gold"" (2016 release; 118 min.) brings the story of Kenny Wells. As the movie opens, we are ""1981, Reno, Nevada"", where we get to know Kenny, working at his dad's company, a mining outfit called Washoe Mining. We then move to ""Seven Years Later"". Kenny is having no luck finding underwriters for his next project. One day, he has a dream to go to Indonesia to find gold. He teams up with geologist Mike Acosta. When Kenny at a certain point is having doubts about their quest, Mike reminds him: ""there is no right or wrong, just hits and misses"". At this point we are 15 min. into the movie but top tell you more of the plot would spoil your viewing experience, you'll just have to see for yourself how it all plays out.Couple of comments: the movie is ""inspired by true events"", we are told. To me that typically means ""loosely inspired by true events"", and we really have no idea how much of what we see on the big screen really happened or not. If anything, Hollywood takes this artistic license to tighten up the story line and dramatize it for our entertainment purposes. Sadly, director Stephen Gaghan (best known for his Oscar-winning script ""Traffic"") is not able to deliver on that promise. The movie is essentially a two-in-one: the search for gold (the initial 45 min.) and what happens after gold is found. The first part of the movie is a snoozer. Why? because we know going in that gold will be found! The second part is better, with a couple of nice twists towards the end. But even then, at no point did I feel emotionally interested in any of it, despite an all-out engaged (and chain-smoking) Matthew McConaughey in the lead role. Bryce Dallas Howard plays his on-and-off romantic interest/girlfriend. Keep your eye out for Craig T. Nelson (playing Kenny's dad). The photography (with Thailand standing in for Indonesia) is beautiful. There is also tons of great music in the film, both as tho the original score (composed by Daniel Pemberton), and song placements, both old and new (including a new Iggy Pop tune, ""Gold"", that plays over the movie's end titles).""Gold"" opened wide this weekend, and the Saturday early evening screening where I saw this at here in Cincinnati was attended okay. I really don't see this playing very long in theaters, but if you are in the mood for a crime/treasure hunt movie, you may want to give this a chance on VOD or eventually on DVD/Blu-ray.",Gold
21,jtindahouse,An inconsistent film,6,11 February 2017,"'Gold' has very uneven tone about it. There are periods that are bordering on cringe-worthy, some dialogue that is bland and uninspired, and some pretentious moments where the film acts as if it's Best Picture worthy at the Academy Awards. Conversely, there are some very good scenes at times, and an ending that certainly gives the film a lot more weight. There were two writers for this film and it almost feels like one would write one scene while the other would write another section of the movie altogether, both with varying degrees of quality.This was an interesting role for Matthew McConaughey. We know he's tried to achieve a make-over of his career, and has done a very good job of it. Gone are the days where he was simply showing up to be the charming guy in a lifeless script and collect a paycheck. Still here, I didn't think he was quite at his best. To be fair some of the dialogue he had to deliver was pretty terribly written and would have been difficult for anyone to pull off. Even still, his performance just felt a little off to me. It's hard to judge an inconsistent film. Overall I'd say it leans more towards being a badly made film than a good one. There was a story to be told here (it's based on a true story), but I just think the way they structured it left a little to be desired. An enjoyable and clever ending does boost it up a bit in quality, but it's still not enough to entirely save it.",Gold
22,stevendbeard,Follow Your Dreams,6,28 January 2017,"I saw ""Gold"", starring Matthew McConaughey-Interstellar, Amistad; Edgar Ramirez-The Girl On the Train, The Bourne Ultimatum; Bryce Dallas Howard-Jurassic World, Terminator Salvation and Craig T. Nelson- Parenthood_tv, Blades of Glory.This is based on a true story about a persistent mineral prospector, played by Matthew. It takes place in the 1980's and Matthew really went all in for the part: He gained 47 pounds, partially shaved his head and even wore false teeth to not look like his normal lovable self-maybe he is hoping for an Oscar nod? Anyway, Matthew comes from a line of prospectors-his father & grandfather-but is temporarily down on his luck. That's when he literally has a dream of finding a tropical jungle with a big gold mine and when he wakes up, he takes off for Indonesia. Bryce plays his devoted but ticked off girlfriend-she is mad because he pawned some of her jewelry to get to Indonesia. Once there, he finds Edgar, a geologist that is just as desperate to strike it rich as he is and the digging begins. Craig plays Matthews' supportive father that inspires Matthew to dream big and go for the gusto in life. When Matthew & Edgar hit it big on the gold mine-arguably the biggest gold find in history-problems come from all directions. Matthew starts drinking a lot, hostile take-overs pop up, everybody wants a piece of the gold and then, the gold disappears. That's when the F.B.I. shows up. It is an interesting story with some good acting by the whole cast but Matthew in particular. It's rated ""R"" for language and sexual content-including nudity-and has a running time of 2 hours & 1 minute. It's not one that I would buy on DVD-once was enough-but it would be a good rental.",Gold
23,alindsay-al,An above average crime thriller,6,6 December 2017,"This film had a big buzz going round it and I have now seen it and I have to be honest it was okay but quite underwhelming. The premise of the film sees a businessman get a last chance to find gold with an eccentric searcher. Now Matthew mcconaughey plays the lead in this film and he owns the screen, there is a clear physical transformation and it helps give him this presence on screen. He commits to this role and gives a great charismatic performance. Edgar ramirez plays his business partner in this film and his usual quite stoic performance works here as there dynamic does really work. Corey stoll also has a good role in the film providing some entertaining scenes. Bruce Dallas Howard plays mcconaughey's romance in the film and I just didn't find there relationship to be very interesting and really didn't need it in the film. Toby kebbell also has a really small role in the film and he was completely underutilised in this film. The first half of the film has an interesting story to it as you see these guys trying to build there project up and I enjoyed it. Unfortunately, I find the last act to be convoluted and all over the place so much that I lost interest in what was going on. The script has some humour in it that does work mixed with a bit of good drama. But there is also too much exposition that I still didn't understand and made the film overly Complex. The style of the film has some good scenes in it especially early when showing how the gold harvesting works. Though there really isn't anything really unique in the film and it does feel pretty run of the mill stuff. Overall this film is an okay but overall forgettable experience.",Gold

Yes, the lead character is a drunked clown who is out of his depth with the sharks of Wall Street, but we forgive him for that because he believes in what he is doing. He even sacrifices a few hundred million dollars because of what he believes. Of course, he is a complete idiot when it comes to doing business; but he is devoted idiot. He believes in his best friend and in keeping his father's name for the company. His ride goes up and down more times than an elevator in the Empire State Building.

25,AudioFileZ,Better Than Many Reviews...A Pretty Wild Ride All In All,7,11 February 2017,"This is a movie one very much wants to find an amazing story within. One that has twists, turns, and, ultimately, a heroic figure who transcends everything to win. And, Gold has all those elements, but they are a bit rushed at times making it a bit of a commitment perhaps not all viewers may share?. I recommend just rolling with it.Based ""around"" a true story it may be best if you're like me and have no previous knowledge. As such I'm ready for a good tale and if parts are true all the better. There's already a few reviews that compare it to the real life story which really isn't the point since this about the movie only. That said the story of Gold is the story of man's search for the ultimate mineral plain and simple. It's why the term ""gold fever"" remains in our present day lexicon. Greed is one thing, but gold causes even more madness Most who seek it end up broken. So, the story of Kenny Wells and Washoe Mining Corp is another, albeit higher profile, story of rags to riches to rags. But maybe there is still a last twist?Matthew McConaughey continues to impress even as this is a character you hold back a bit rooting for. I think that's kind of fascinating in itself. Instead of portraying the ultimate underdog we get a slovenly arrogant P.T Barnum that lacks Barnum's trump card of business acumen. It would be a much easier to root for a J.R. Ewing.. Wells feels like he's going to crash from the start and McConaughey makes it like a train wreckwatchable because you can't turn away. In this way this is actually better than many reviewers seem to be giving it credit for. I say give it a chance and you'll stay for the ride. I like the way it leaves some questions in the end which is unusual because usually open endings are frustrating. It seems right here. Maybe Wells was P.T. Barnum after all?",Gold
26,burlesonjesse5,VIEWS ON FILM review of Gold,6,29 January 2017,"A mediocre businessman and rattled, treasure prospector finds out that there might be gold buried deep in the jungles of Borneo (the largest island in Asia). That's the gist of 2016's Gold, my latest review.Based loosely on true events (and I do mean loosely), Gold changes the names and places to protect the you know what (ha ha). It's a two hour film that gives you a story told once too often. It's rags to riches then back to rags again. It's also the rise and fall of the untrustworthy American dream. Are parts of Gold entertaining? Yup. Are parts of it fully compelling or invigorating? Eh, a little.Anyway, Gold stars Matthew McConaughey in the titled character of Kenny Wells. Did he know he wasn't making an Academy Award winner here? Probably not. Regardless, McConaughey is fully committed to his part. Strutting like Les Grossman from his own Tropic Thunder and looking like Albert Finney when Albert played Ebenezer Scrooge, McConaughey dons false teeth, a receding hairline, an over dramatic sense of being, and forty pounds of extra weight. He then proceeds to chew scenery as if he were a canine staring down five T-bone steaks. Matthew's Wells chain smokes and drinks hard liquor in almost every scene in Gold. It's enough to get lung cancer and then have that cancer get cancer. No joke.As for the rest of the cast, well Edgar Ramirez plays Michael Acosta. Acosta is a geologist and the veritable ""straight man"" to Kenny Wells. Ramirez seems to be in a lot more movies these days. I almost forgot about him completely after he appeared in 2005's Domino. Lastly, the gleaming Bryce Dallas Howard channels Kenny's longtime girlfriend Kay. She supports him and goes along with his plight before it gets out of hand. Howard comes off as a side trouper but still supplies plenty of eye candy. I dug her retro hair style. Believe that.Now Gold is set in the late 1980's yet it appears like it could have went down in the mid-70's. Heck, it's still a decent looking film all around. Indonesia appears lush from a helicopter (you could almost imagine Indiana Jones hiding in the background), Nevada is dusty and seedy, and New York is well, New York. Gold's music is by Daniel Pemberton. It sounds similar to something along the lines of trip hop master David Holmes (Holmes scored Ocean's Eleven and Out of Sight). Finally, the choppy editing by Douglas Crise gives Gold the distinction of having slight plot holes. Likewise, Gold supplies you with the feeling that it takes place over a decade when in fact, the happenings pretty much occur within a year's time (1988 to be exact).All in all, Gold is hardly authentic (get it). It's a movie that might have made more of an impact had it come out fifteen years ago (that's just pure speculation). Nevertheless, it's emulation Scorsese and me-too Paul Thomas Anderson. It also contains remnants of 2009's Middle Men, Johnny Depp's Blow, and last year's War Dogs. If this appeals to you, then it might be worth a look. Still, it sure seems like an odd choice for director Stephen Gaghan. He won a screenplay Oscar for Traffic and got nominated for one with the critically acclaimed Syriana. His Gold is a tad too animated and/or satiric to be taken seriously. Bottom line: It feels like Gaghan might be a little above this material. Overall rating: 2 and a half stars.Of note: During the last quarter of Gold, Matthew McConaughey's Wells has his picture shown on the front page of a newspaper. The headline actually reads, ""Fool's Good"". A subtle nod to McConaughey's nastily panned film of the same name? Perhaps. Either way, it's kinda funny.",Gold
27,vengeance20,Pretty good watch!,6,10 February 2017,"Saw this last night at the Odeon & thought it was a pretty good film!Matthew McConaughey, Oscar winner of 2014s The Wolf of Wall Street, stars as Kenny Wells, a prospector who busts his balls to get a stroke of luck by trying to find gold in the Indonesian jungle. The film follows ups & downs a he rises to fame & comes crashing down from those trying to screw him over!I found the film to be some what moving & quite entertaining, I myself was sort of not in the mood from nearly being late to see this but it sort of lifted me to watch it almost, it wasn't boring or slow, it kept you on you seat pretty much, though my arse did begin to ache a little near the end, but overall it was a pretty decent watch! Reminded me of The Wolf of Wall Street in a lot of ways too!6/10 A decent watch of a film!",Gold
28,bkrauser-81-311064,All That Glitters is Not Gold,6,31 January 2017,"In many ways, Gold is very similar to the recently released The Founder. Both stories are about a singularly persistent fella who finds his fortunes on a hunch. Early on, a lot of plans are foiled by inflexible thinking, people live to rue the day they underestimated their opponent and our protagonist is eventually changes and lost to the corruptible powers of fame and fortune. Yet the difference between the two films is while The Founder is clipped by problems of unfocused narrative, divergent themes and clumsy directing, Gold crashes and burns under the force of those same problems.Gold tells the story of a scrappy Nevada prospecting firm privately owned through the years by three generations of gold hunters. After five years of running the place, CEO Kenny Wells (McConaughey), struggles to honor the name of his belated father (Nelson) and grandfather. Down on his luck, Wells pawns his girlfriend's (Howard) jewelry and makes buy-in calls from a local tavern to make ends meet. Then, in a whiskey induced haze, Wells has a vivid dream about a thicket of Indonesian jungle. He wakes up convinced he can find gold in them thar hills and recruits the only geologist (Ramirez) wily enough to chance an excavation. ""The last card you turn over, is the only card that matters,"" says the mad-eyed Wells. And his last card just may be the biggest gold find of all time.Much of the film's charm relies on McConaughey's bravura performance as the bumpkin-like Kenny. Bearing false teeth, a beer gut and a bald patch, Kenny completely lacks the physical or professional attributes needed to stratify the American class system. ""It's like a raccoons got a hold of the Hope Diamond,"" says Corey Stoll's investment banker character. A metaphor that describes not only the conflict between Kenny and the powers that be but McConaughey and this movie.The movie in this case is the raccoon, which has no idea what it's doing with such a committed performance. It uneasily treads the plotting of a rags-to-riches story then loses itself in second-rate heist movie entanglements and airless buddy comedy clichés. All the while it keeps darting up through the tall grass waiting for audiences to respond with the same gasps they would be uttering if they were watching, say, The Treasure of the Sierra Madre (1948).Yeah sorry movie, comparing you to the Humphrey Bogart staple is like comparing Citizen Kane (1941) to Other People's Money (1991). The narrative is so disjointed, the themes mined of all substance and the supporting characters feel robbed of any defining characteristics. Meanwhile the cinematography, while decent in parts, can't find a unifying tone let alone real human character amid lush jungle and McConaughey's bilious scenery chewing.It's all so morally convoluted as well. The film tries to setup Kenny as a working-class hero while simultaneously building itself as a movie against accumulating wealth for wealth's sake. Kenny takes great strides to elevate his profession; waxing poetically about the nobility of gold prospecting as if it were a quasi-religious affirmation. His fidelity to those he works with, his family's legacy, not to mention the movie's constant willingness to portray him as an underdog, all point to a character worth rooting for. Yet I ask, how honorable is such a character when, within the context of the movie, all his decisions are made for the purpose of ego and saving face? It becomes even more disgusting when you consider everything in the context of history. The real story of Bre-X Minerals (based in Calgary, Canada not Reno), is one of unsurpassed fraud. Fraud that resulted in billions of dollars lost including the pilfering of several public pension funds and retirement boards. The real life owners of Bre-X (for which Kenny is a composite) all claimed their innocence at the time despite finding refuge in The Bahamas and The Caymans respectively.As a story of rags-to-riches, a story of fraud and a story based on real events, Gold all but fails to live up to its name. It is instead, a hollow, boring and long movie that leans heavily on McConaughey's hooting and hollering to carry it through to the end. My advice: if you want to see a better McConaughey performance that gives complex real-life events a simplistic but satisfying narrative - watch Dallas Buyers Club (2013) instead.",Gold
29,tomsview,Looking for the mother lode,7,27 July 2017,"""Gold"" seems long and has around three finales, but has a great ending that makes up for a lot.It starts in the 1980's; Matthew McConaughey plays Kenny Wells, a man who goes on a life-affirming quest to get funding for a new gold mine in Indonesia. He is a prospector at heart, although the physical search for gold is carried out by geologist Mike Acosta (Édgar Ramírez). The two join forces and seemingly discover a mountain of gold. However there are problems with the finance, the workers and eventually the Indonesian government. Finally there is the possibility that the whole thing is an elaborate scam.Kenny's love life suffers as his relentless search for the mother lode damages the relationship with his girlfriend, Kay (Bryce Dallas Howard). Matthew McConaughey goes to town on this role. Along the way he starts to lose his hair and develops a paunch; it's a pretty amazing performance and he does a number of his trademark, offbeat monologues.""Gold"" feels like ""The Wolf of Wall Street"" but without the laughs – it takes itself far more seriously. Kenny Wells is a driven man, and it's hard to totally identify with such self-focused characters. Leonardo DiCaprio's Jordan Belfort could laugh at himself and it made all the difference.With that said, the film has terrific locations and some great scenes including one where Kenny adds to his credentials as a risk taker by staring down a tiger. Iggy Pop channels Leonard Cohen to add a cool sound to the soundtrack with the theme song ""Gold"" and Daniel Pemberton's score is pretty chilled out, giving the film a mood without being obvious.As Kenny's fortunes ebb and flow, ""Gold"" seems a frustrating experience. However as the story plays out, Kenny's exuberance grows on you. Despite the pain in getting to the end, like Kenny, we exit the story with a smile.",Gold
30,areatw,'Gold' is bronze at best,5,8 September 2017,"The synopsis of this film couldn't be more misleading. This is NOT 'a journey to find gold in the uncharted jungle of Indonesia', like the synopsis suggests. It's more like an office drama set in the big city, with only sporadic scenes of actual gold hunting. It has completely the wrong focus and is told in a way that the viewer can't help but feel detached from everything that's happening on screen.Part of the problem is that this film is supposed to be based on a true story, yet the whole thing feels like pretentious Hollywood crap. It's dull and emotionless. The entertainment in this film is restricted to only a few scenes, while the rest of the film is just extended scenes of dialogue, which the audience couldn't care less about.Speaking of the dialogue, a lot of scenes at the start of 'Gold' are mumbled and difficult to understand, which only added to my dissatisfaction.",Gold

Robert Elswit is completely wasted here as cinematographer. His work here is beautiful to look at, as always, which at least makes this film semi-watchable.

35,rockman182,Gold (2017),6,11 February 2017,"Well, The McConaissance had to end sometime. Its also not really surprising that it comes to a screeching halt with Gold. I didn't really enjoy The Free State of Jones either but thought The Sea of Trees was interesting, even if it tried to tug on your emotions. With Gold you have a film that is too long, too uninteresting, and one that just fails to leave a lasting impression. its definitely a January dump film disguised as something that could be award worthy.Gold is inspired by a true story of a down out of luck guy who thinks he strikes gold in the jungles of Indonesia, only to find out this is not really what it seems. Matthew McConaughey stars as Kenny Wells, a very awkwardly balding man who needs something big to happen and becomes optimistic when it seems like it does. This sounds a bit like a film I saw recently called The Founder, but with much less payoff. I cannot really blame McConaughey for his committed performance in the film, I just wish he would spend his time on better projects. He was on a hot streak early on in the decade and he was in great works. This is a completely forgettable film that becomes frustrating as it goes on .There is an impressive cast, whose strengths are mostly underutilized because the film has to try to go forward with a narrative that tries to shock but is nowhere near gold. There's nothing amazing about the cinematography, I would have at least expected gorgeous scenes of the Indonesian landscape. At times the dialogue is too subdued and slow for me, the film tries your patience. I think Bryce Dallas Howard is great but there wasn't any real chemistry between her and McConaughey. Its just a film that everyone involved should move forward from.Stephen Gaghan is an ordinary writer and filmmaker, I'm sorry but its true. His films subject matters do not offer enough engagement for a wide audience nor are his films really memorable. Yes, I've seen Syriana and stills and by that. I'm not overly offended. You got a real view of what the film would be like from the trailer, and if you thought otherwise you were chasing Fools Gold (I just had to try to pun another awful McConaughey film with a similar title here).6/10",Gold

He dreams that he will find a strike in Indonesia so he sets out to find his dream.The movie goes for a great American story feel as McConaughey drinks and smokes through the film and as I watched I was under the impression that it was a closer to truth than later research revealed. Wells is married to Kay (Bryce Dallas Howard) who wants a simple life but is supportive of her husband's unfettered ambition. Howard is entertaining as the simple woman who sees through the niceties of the Wall Street bankers like Brian Woolf (Corey Stoll).

This time he fully committed (and few actors dare to sacrifice their physical image portraying a mediocre egocentric, selfish and drunk gold digger) sadly the movie does not reach the level of Mr McConaughey acting skills and sacrifice.The basic story is about a mediocre mine searcher that after almost ruining his family company; in a last attempt to success and squeezing his last resources; find a Geologist (the always reliable Edgar Ramirez) and together find a gold mine in Indonesia. The finding looks very promising so all people that never trust him (Banks and Investment companies) start helping him but only to take control of his project; and ultimate steal it from him.He is able to fight them back and recover until an unexpected twist change things again (if you do not know the real events it will surprise you).The movie is ""inspired by true events"" which basically means only few points are real; however the most important facts are real.The movie does not try to be historically accurate; just to show how small companies are used, betrayed and destroyed by the financial marketers in order to protect the biggest corporations and most important how at the end; only the small investors (basically the common people) are the ones that lose their life savings deceived by those ""legal scams"".It is a pity Stephen Gaghan (the director who also directed SYRIANA) did not dig more on the intricacies of the gold market and the big scam it really involves instead on focusing on a hideous character that become just a little likable only because Mathew outstanding effort.There are a few great actors in the movie; aside from the outstanding Ramirez, Stoll is very good as the financial adviser with his own agenda and Bryce Dallas Howard as the suffering girlfriend.

42,brankovranjkovic,The Wolf of Boredom (Not Engaging and Pretty Dull),2,4 February 2017,"Very loosely based on a true story of a gold miner in the pursuit of striking gold in Indonesia. This film is set in 1988 and stars Matthew McConaughey as the protagonist Kenny Wells, whose driving ambition is to strike gold in a big way. He has a dream, but not just in terms of determination, he actually has a dream and decides 'I must follow that dream at any cost!' He discovered the largest gold find of the decade, his wealth is unimaginable. Then it all starts going wrong. It turns out that his geologist partner was 'salting' the extracted rock samples to give the impression of a great gold find. The rock analysis results could not be recreated, and so the FBI is called in. The FBI extensively question Kenny for fraud over several days, but eventually release him due to lack of evidence. However, you're left wondering whether he was always in on it, especially when he gets a cheque for half the $164,000,000 swindled money. But then you can't help wondering how he's ever going to cash in the enormous cheque with the FBI closely watching his every move! McConaughey is a great method actor, and for this character he puts on 47lbs around his belly, he's seen constantly drinking, chain smoking, and has very thinning hair. The furthest from his normal superstar heartthrob self that you could imagine.This film looks like another made for TV drama, I didn't care about the character's or their eventual outcome.

It was an interesting moment in a class where dry material was a daily problem. So when I heard about Gold, I was in immediately. Having seen Gold now, critics have been pretty harsh.

He explains to her about his job as a prospector and what the company does. He has a short meeting with his dad and they talk about their projects and how lucky they are. Kenny then tells us that was the last time he saw his father alive.We then flash forward 8 years and Kenny is in some dire straits. Kenny has gained a lot of weight and drinks way too much. Washcoe is still running but it's running out of a bar. Kay works there as a waitress and they're on the edge of losing both the business and their home. Wells tries to go raise some capital to investigate in a new dig site in Manitoba but he's invited in and dismissed just as quickly. He falls asleep in a drunken stupor at Kay's place. When he's asleep he dreams of a gold mine in a jungle in Indonesia. When he awakes, he's sure he's had a vision and he steals his girlfriend's jewellery. He then pawns it and buys a ticket to Indonesia, he's going to seek out a former whiz kid Michael Acosta (Edgar Ramirez) who's fallen from grace and together they'll find the site for the mine.I'll dive into the character of Kenny Wells first. One of the minor problems the movie faces is Wells lives in a small area between hero and villain. He tries hard and cares deeply about his profession which makes his motivations easy to like but he's prone to sabotaging himself through booze, infidelity and hot-headed decisions. I say this because I think you end up liking him because of McConaughey giving it his all instead of actually rooting for Wells. His friendship with Acosta is really his saving grace. While Matthew and Edgar are a believable pair of friends, the nature of their friendship is undercut by the movie's ending (more on that later).The next thing is that I found the plot of the movie to be pretty interesting but it doesn't stray too far away from your typical rise and fall story. I liked how the movie showed how dirty and even slimy the world around mining can be both in the conditions and with the people you have to deal with. No one can begrudge Mike and Kenny of the hard work they did even though things didn't work out. Gold did a decent job explaining the mining process and how hard it was to get things going. If there's a problem, the bad guys they run into are given very little dimension and they're pretty interchangeable. You get to see some of the cool things Wells and his friends got to enjoy when they achieved success but it pales in comparison to things in The Wolf of Wall Street.I think the reason that viewers will tune into Gold is to see McConaughey doing his thing. I'm happy to report that his performance anchors the movie. He does a good job and he's obviously committed to the role but he walks a fine line between fun to watch and chewing the scenery. He ends up overdoing it sometimes but he's easily still one of the best parts of the movie. I also liked Edgar Ramirez, he plays off of Matthew well and you can buy them as friends. Their underdog chip-on-their-shoulder friendship is believable. I'm a big fan of Bryce Dallas Howard and she does excellent work with a relatively shallow character. She has good chemistry with McConaughey, her character might be quiet but her support was vital for Kenny. Corey Stoll and Bill Camp are given very little, their parts might not be worth actors of their talent. Toby Kebbell is barely in the movie as is Craig T. Nelson.My biggest problem with Gold is how they choose to tell the story. They bring in the investigation into Waschoe relatively late into the movie. It's something that you would think they would bring it in at the beginning or the end but to start it in the middle felt weird. I also found the ending to be confusing and poorly managed. They never make completely clear how complicit Wells was in the fraud, how much did he know or not know? I felt the movie was really ambiguous about that. Even having known the story going in, I also found the twist really came out of left field. You would think that they would have done a little foreshadowing but they just drop it right in the last 20 minutes.Gold ended up being decent instead of great. There's nothing wrong with that but I still left the theatre a little disappointed. If you're interested in the story or a big McConaughey fan, I think you'll like this but I ended up agreeing with the critics that it might end up being forgotten next to films like The Wolf of Wall Street or The Big Short.",Gold
45,rubenm,Capitalist adventure movie,7,9 April 2017,"Essentially, 'Gold' is an old fashioned adventure movie. A hostile environment, changing fortunes, shifting alliances, unexpected adversaries, a seemingly betrayed friendship: it's all there. But the setting is out of the ordinary: it's the financial world with millions of dollars pumped into promising mining stocks. But those millions can just as quickly be withdrawn when the prospects change.The adventurer in the midst of it all is Kenny Wells, son of a Nevada gold prospector and heir to an almost bankrupt mining company. In an all-or-nothing attempt, he travels to Indonesia for a meeting with a legendary drilling expert. The next step is to find the money required for the drilling. What follows, is a roller-coaster ride of successes and setbacks.Matthew McConaughey is amazing as Kenny Wells, a raving maniac with a fearless can-do mentality and a complete lack of respect for Wall Street hotshots or mining moguls. This is one of his best roles ever, and it's worth an Oscar. You can see the doubt in the eyes of everyone he meets: is this a madman who doesn't know what he's up to, or a go-getter who doesn't give up until he reaches his goal? Wells is both, and McConaughey makes his complex character completely believable.There are some extra layers in the story underlining this complexity: the relationship with his wife Kay, and the friendship with his business partner Mike Acosta. The latter is responsible for the spectacular ending of the story, with a really nice surprise in the last seconds.The whole story is based on the Bre-X scandal, which hit the worldwide headlines in the nineties. Some details are changed, but on the whole the story follows the real events pretty accurate. The scandal was a prime example of excessive capitalist greed, and the film is a nice reminder of it.",Gold
46,chicagopoetry,An Epic Masterpiece,8,10 February 2017,"Just watched GOLD starring Matthew McConaughey. This is an epic movie. It's only two hours long but it feels like a three hour movie. I don't mean this in a bad way. It's not that it's slow and boring and seems like it's taking a long time, more that it's so complicated and has so many unexpected turns that it feels odd that it's all packed into two hours. This film starts out kind of like Boiler Room and then turns into Wolf of Wall Street but then takes a pretty depressing turn in the third act, but what can you do--it's based on true events. McConaughey is as brilliant as ever, playing a gold prospector who is way over his head and out of his league and one of the things to be noted about this film is the costumes: it really took some guts to continue to dress the characters like white trash as they suddenly find themselves in Wall Street society. And the musical score as well is suburb and very foreshadowing. I really loved this movie. Well worth a watch.",Gold
47,Okonh0wp,Gives us little to reason to care until the second act,3,4 February 2017,"The problem with ""Gold"" is that it takes you into an esoteric world (in this case, let's call it ""large-scale multi-national gold mining?"") without making us care about the intricacies of the topic. Instead, it follows the template laid out in Oliver Stone's ""Wall Street"" (and that Martin Scorsese bludgeoned to death in ""Wolf of Wall Street"") of showering the viewer in capitalism porn: Shots of people getting rowdier as visual cues (i.e. graphs going upwards, the stock exchange ringing) show them getting richer and richer. This is a shame because Stephen Gaghan masterfully wove story threads in an Altmanesque manner to tell the story of the global oil crisis.Perhaps my expectations were high here, but without that effort to make the economics of an economics film engaging (""Big Short"" is a better example of this), there's little reason to care about this story. It's just some schlub who looks an awful lot like Christian Bale's character in ""American Hustle"" (another better film with which this one shares suspicious stylistic similarities) who hits a lucky streak and experiences good things.In the second half, some twists emerge, including one big blind-siding whopper that is very likely what catapulted the real life story out of obscurity and led to the existence of this film, but by then it's too little too late and there's not really any foreshadowing that makes the big reveal interesting. What's even more frustrating is that what could have made the film palatable was right there in the script. The story is framed around a mysterious interview that McConaughey's character has with either his lawyer or the FBI but this narrative device is employed extremely half-heartedly.Despite the film's grandiose ambitions, the film is only memorable in the end for a smattering of striking images that don't lead up to more than the sum of their parts: The ""Apocalypse Now"" allusion of a man coming to terms with his demons in the Southeast Asian jungle, the contrast between the sweetness of Bryce Dallas Howard and the raw ugliness of McConaughey (I'm presuming he gained weight for this part), and the odd homoerotic gaze with which McConaughey shows to Edgar Ramirez's character.",Gold

49,kaptenvideo-89875,Greed is good!,7,29 January 2017,"Prospector and geologist desperate for a lucky break (Matthew McConaughey, Edgar Ramírez) try to find gold in the uncharted jungle of Indonesia. They find what they were looking for but keeping the gold may be even more difficult than finding it.Based on a true event from the 1990's. Also appearing: Bryce Dallas Howard, Corey Stoll, Craig T. Nelson et al.Do you remember the times when Matthew McConaughey used to have ripped body, look like million dollars and star in mainstream movies?The current decade has brought us a new kind of McConaughey. He prefers to look like sh_t, doesn't care much about mainstream, and has sworn allegiance to method acting, or whatever it's called these days.In short, the man doesn't do roles anymore, he becomes who he's supposed to play. And luckily for movie buffs, he picks projects that really have something to say.McConaughey was always a good enough actor but the new him is something of a revelation. He brings this fresh kind of – for want of a more suitable term – in-your-face style where every detail and nuance of the performance has been made to count, cameras often close-up.Only a few movies are using this approach – psychologically, it probably asks much from both thespian and director working with him. But McConaughey has absolutely nailed this brave method, best witnessed in ""Interstellar"", first season of HBO's ""True Detective"", and now ""Gold"".I don't always consider the appearances of a character an essential part of the performance, especially if the movie is not related to sci-fi, but this time is an exception. This is the role remembered by both powerful acting style described above and how the character looks like.The man looks even more deliciously disgusting than usual, sporting pot-belly (result of gaining 20 kilos for the role), false teeth (making him look a bit like working class Austin Powers from 1990's USA) and skullet. And all this only enhances his usual energetic in- your-face performance.A word about skullet. This amazing hairstyle is, by my definition, the second worst crime a male person can commit against his appearance. Google it or something.It's basically a bald head WITH mullet and in real life it would be reason enough to make many people stay away, I imagine. McConaughey does not shy away from it and it becomes another reason you will remember ""Gold"" for.This is director Stephen Gaghan's first movie since 2005's intelligent but raher boring ""Syriana"". And the comeback is noteworthy indeed.Thus far, I haven't written much about movie as a whole, for two reasons. First and foremost, although the cast is big and good, it is McConaughey's show. If you happen to not care about him, there's little motivation to watch.The main possible exception is Bryce Dallas Howard as leading character's wife, in a kind and warm role the Supporting Actress Oscars are perfect for. Except she didn't get nominated. But it perfectly compensates the manic energy of the main man.Secondly, it's basically another of those countless ""greed makes good"" American stories which are inspired by and copy the basics of 1987's seminal classic ""Wall Street"". You know, the rise and fall of a underdog who never gave up.Although they make the same old tired story function nicely, one can't really call it inspiring or fresh again. I felt the same about ""Wolf of Wall Street"", by the way. The less you have seen this type of stuff, the higher you'd score ""Gold"".Somehow the project hasn't gotten recognition during current awards season, having only won Hollywood Film Award for the ensemble of the year and gotten nominated for the Golden Globe for the best song.The critics at RottenTomatoes and Metacritic doesn't give it a warm welcome either. Let me disagree on this one. ""Gold"" is not original but perfectly decent watch anyway.",Gold
50,trublu215,Entertaining Yet Uninspired.,5,1 January 2017,"Gold is, by far, the oddest film of the Oscar season. It's not good enough to be featured with some other award-based films yet it is far from being a bad film. It's just a very uninspired piece of filmmaking that had an excellent script and a great cast to it, yet no flavor to the filmmaking here. It is a standardized piece that serves as a lackluster love letter to Martin Scorsese and David O. Russell without ever really admitting it. Majority of this film is spent watching McCounaughey's Kenny Wells as he maneuvers through businessmen that want him to be put down, political groups that want to steal his fortune and friends he can barely trust. It sounds like an amazing film and it could have been had Gaghan not directed this film himself. Every frame that passes, it feels like Gaghan was either worried about feeling too much like Scorsese or worried that it wasn't enough like Scorsese. Either way, we know where his influences lie here. Honestly, you're better off watching The Wolf of Wall Street, if you're hoping for something like that.Stephen Gaghan is a very talented writer, he's given us very layered stories with very interesting characters but this particular topic feels like it went over his head. It is never engaging enough to sustain lasting power. McConaughey and the rest of the cast do a fine job, nothing outstanding but fine nonetheless. This was probably the most disappointing part of this film. Over the past 5 years, Matthew McConaughey has given us more than enough reason to love his performances. They're layered, they're relate-able and, most of all, they're acted to perfection. This performance, in which he trades in his slim physique for a bloated, overweight and balding man. Right off the bat, this may have been a physically demanding role for McConaughey and he does put his all into his performance but it still doesn't match the caliber of his previous performances. His dedication is clear but it still didn't feel like the great performance we thought he could give in this film which comes back to the issue of Gaghan's direction.Overall, Gold is far from a bad movie. There are cool scenes in it that are bound to interest you even if it's for a little bit. But this is a film that comes down to a problem with the director. Gaghan, while being a very talented writer, has a hard time determining his own vision for a film that had many chances to be great but failed to really capitalize on any of its strengths. By the end of the film, you won't feel cheated out of your ticket money but I'm sure you won't feel all that good about it either.",Gold
51,PetarNeo,McCounaghey never stops,7,4 March 2017,An easy example of how everybody goes mad around gold is this movie that tells a story about massive if can be called fraud but more trick played. Kenny Wells (Matthew McCounaghey) is a successor of company that deals with findings of minerals and making profits outs of it and as time went by they were running deeper and deeper into a hole. After all hopes are lost Kenny decides to take a big risk and travel to Indonesian to meet with Michael Acosta. Michael (Edgar Ramirez) is a geologist that has belief that gold is somewhere in forests in Indonesia so he gets Kenny to turn everything around and help him dig that out. After being sick for many weeks and almost dying and when all hopes seemed lost Edgar bring a happy news. They found gold so now only thing that needs to be done is to find someone to finance that digging and there comes Jeff Jackson (Timothy Simons). He gets so hooked up to idea that there is a massive gold lying somewhere around that he manages to get a lot people in buying stocks of Wells company. Everything was going great but after discovery that it was all set up by Edgar and that he got away with ton of money movie just gets mad. There is everybody being tricked by one guy and story losses it power because of fact that they all forgot to check report and analyse in their greed and belief in him. Including love life of Kenny and his girlfriend Kay in story was something that should not be bigger focus but at times it felt that way. Story seems great and there is some of good dialogue but it lacks in focus on importance of things but feels surreal and silly to even happen. Ending was a huge improvement in story and it probably lift character of Edgar. 2.5/4,Gold

He also talks too much and even though you can see that he is good-hearted you can't refrain from wondering why a slightly overweight but still pretty Bryce Dallas Howard doesn't desert him.

54,rutzelb,Overrated but sort of entertaining,5,3 May 2017,"This is inspired by true events: the 1993 Bre-X Mineral Corp mining scandal.Running a failing mining company - Washoe - Kenny Wells (McConaughey) teams up with Geologist Mike Acosta (Edgar Ramirez) to find gold in Indonesia. Mike convinces Kenny that he knows how to find gold. Gold is found and everything looks good; then J.P. Morgan wants to buy Washoe out eliminating Kenny's name and Kenny says no. Then the Indonesian government takes over the mine. All seems lost until Kenny and Mike shore things up with the son of Suharto, the head of the Indonesian government and things are back on track. Then Mike gets arrested and everything falls apart. This was sort of entertaining, but I didn't care about any of the characters and just let it roll along. McConaughey as Kenny Wells played a sort of maniac resulting in over-acting and I just didn't care for this. I kept thinking that this was a Woody Harrelson movie, (Was he offered the job?) but we kept seeing an out-of- control person only concerned about finding gold which seemed to be more important to him than the money it brought in. Strange, eh? And Harrelson would have been more convincing with his hooting and hollering. Ah, I can see it now. There is a major twist in here and we learn a lot when Kenny sits down with FBI agent Jennings (Toby Kebbell) near the end and it is here the movie became good.Unless I missed something I am not sure if Kay (Bryce Dallas Howard) was Kenny's girlfriend or his wife. (Well it doesn't matter too much) Kay does warn Kenny that J.P. Morgan people are out to get him out of the business. Notables: Stacy Keach as Clive, a financial backer of Kenny and friend of Kenny's father played by Craig T. Nelson; Bruce Greenwood as Mark Hancock with Barrick Gold, who tries to make a deal with Kenny; Corey Stoll as Brian an executive with J.P. Morgan who tries to get Kenny out of the picture. I was very impressed with Edgar Ramirez as Mike Acosta and we looked to him to be sure everything was on track. He was the sane person in here as opposed to the out–of-control, but very determined Kenny Wells. This is overrated, sort of entertaining and it would have helped if I cared about the characters, and I didn't. Something wasn't right in here, but all will be surprised at the ending.

58,makleen2,Gold Glitters,8,25 September 2017,"Greed and obsession collide in Gold (2016), a gritty morality tale set in 1980s Nevada, Wall Street, and Indonesia. Matthew McConaughey plays Kenny Wells, a prospector desperate for a lucky break. He teams up with geologist Michael Acosta (Edgar Ramírez), and together they descend into the uncharted jungles of Indonesia hoping to find one big score. This poorly-advertised film almost escaped my notice, until I saw it playing at my local theater. I'm glad I took a chance on it. Gold is a solid film and surprisingly entertaining. Matthew McConaughey disappears into the role, achieving absolute rock bottom in body and spirit.Gold is loosely based on a true story. In 1995, a small Canadian mining company called Bre-X, owned by David Walsh, claimed to find a massive gold deposit deep in the Indonesian jungle on the Island of Borneo, near the Busang River. Filipino geologist Michael de Guzman and John Felderhof convinced Walsh to invest $80,000 to purchase and develop the gold mine.In 1997, Bre-X collapsed and its shares became worthless in one of the biggest stock scandals in Canadian history. On March 19, 1997, de Guzman committed suicide by jumping from a helicopter in Busang, Indonesia. An independent investigation of core samples from the mine determined de Guzman had been ""salting"" the samples with gold flakes, some from his own wedding ring. Walsh died of a brain aneurysm in the Bahamas in 1998, and in 2007, Felderhof was acquitted of securities charges. The scandal cost investors an estimated $3 billion.Gold follows Nevada prospector Kenny Wells, who inherited his father's company, Washoe Mining, in the early 1980s. Stress-induced alcoholism caused by the economic downturn leads him to sell the last of his jewelry and fly to Indonesia to meet geologist Michael Acosta. There he endures hardship and survives malaria. When he emerges from the illness, Acosta tells him he made what might be the largest gold discovery in history.Enter Mark Hancock (Bruce Greenwood) and the Wall Street tycoons who try to wrest control of the mine from Wells and Acosta. Wells refuses to budge, saying, ""If you sell your dream, what do you have left?"" Meanwhile, the overnight success destroys his relationship with longtime girlfriend Kay (Bryce Dallas Howard) and strains his friendship with Acosta.Just before the fraud is revealed, Michael Acosta dumps his shares and disappears, leaving Wells to pick up the pieces and deal with angry investors and the FBI. FBI Agent Paul Jennings (Toby Kebbell) tells Wells that Acosta's body was found, eaten by wild boars, in the Indonesian jungle. I won't spoil the rest, suffice to say, the movie leaves Acosta's death open to interpretation.Directed by Stephen Gaghan, writer of Syriana (2005), Traffic (2000), and Havoc (2005), Gold looks and feels like American Hustle (2013) and The Wolf of Wall Street (2013), but a little more down-to-earth. Kenny Wells is believable and flawed. McConaughey sells him to the audience. We want his dream to come true as desperately as he does. It's not about the money, he argues, it's about the gold. By finding the mine and saving his family business, he will prove to himself and his long-departed father he's not a failure. Who doesn't understand that kind of motivation? I criticized Patriots Day (2016) for playing a little loose with the facts. After all, it was trying to dramatically portray actual events–events most of us watched unfold on television. Doesn't Gold suffer from the same problem? Not really. Although it's marketed as, ""based on a too good to be true story,"" Gold never claims to be retelling history. Although there are times when it blurs that line, the characters are fictional, the company is fictional, the Wall Street tycoons are fictional. In that regard, it is more like American Hustle than The Wolf of Wall Street. While the Bre-X scandal rocked Canada, most Americans have probably never heard of it.In fact, screenwriters Patrick Massett and John Zinman were inspired to write the script after Massett saw an episode about the Bre-X scandal on a crime show. What seemed like a good idea for a movie turned into a screenplay inspired by, but not entirely based on, true events.Some critics have unfairly dismissed Gold as lackluster and uninspired. Granted, it's not a huge Hollywood production, but it has heart. Bryce Dallas Howard gives a good performance as Kenny Wells' girlfriend Kay, who seems enamored with Wells' enormous dreams but ultimately just wants to live a simple, quiet life. Though it flew under the radar, the film grossed $3.47 million in its opening weekend. It's definitely the best movie I've seen so far this year.",Gold

When your at your very lowest, with nothing left to lose, then risking everything, isn't too difficult. Matthew McConaughey is brilliant as he always is. The mystery of his ability is different from other actors. He looks, talks and seems very much the same in all his roles, yet somehow makes you believe he is that person. Bryce Howard also gives a good performance. Her physical appearance is trans-formative, and you clearly would never recognize her. This movie combined the elements of a treasure hunt, and the allure and adventure of the find, with a corporate thriller. Realism, however, prevents me from going higher.

It seems to have everything; the American dream, money, sex, exotic locations, the little guy risking it all, international intrigue, the will to power, and based on a true story too. Damn, sign me up!But somehow it never quite all comes together, and there's blame to go around.The screenplay by Patrick Massett and John Zinman never settles on a point-of-view on Kenny Wells (Matthew McConaughey), and the exploits of American companies overseas. Are we to view him and his ilk as swashbuckling entrepreneurs who do things their way and bring fortune not just to themselves but to all who work with them? Or is he, and all like him, just a lucky fool who swaggers and cons his way into the big time
Has manifest destiny been made flesh in Kenny Wells as he takes from the foreigners and makes America rich? Or has corporate America feasted too long, and now only makes money by selling dreams to each other?You could make the case for any of this, but the film makers are not willing to go to those places despite the material clearly leading them there. Why even make Wells the centre of the movie when the central gold claim is made by another man? The movie goes out of its way to show us that Wells was sick while others acted during the crucial moments.The movie cannot resolve the tension between wanting to examine American capital at work in the world, but not having the courage to condemn where necessary.McConaughey won't explore the merits of modern global capitalism but he is willing to go to a more ugly place physically. His Wells is an overweight, hard drinking, gambler with a receding hairline, and boy, does the camera really want us to revel in just how overweight McConaughey is. Unfortunately, physical ugliness is as far as McConaughey is willing to go. Wells loses the family business, steals from his girlfriend, and gets rich on the back of others work but he is played as a lovable rogue. And I admit, it works; McConaughey's charms just can't be resisted. I was hooked, and was rooting for his personal success even as I had doubts about the merits of his business dealings.Director Stephen Gaghan wrote ""Traffic"" and ""Syriana"" - both admirable and wonderful attempts to unpack the impacts of America's role in the world, and I wish he had been the one to write this. As it is, his direction is fine but doesn't bring the material to life. He doesn't find a way to communicate the hard edged grind of life at the bottom of corporate America, nor the sweltering poverty of Indonesian miners, or the shiny excess of New York boardrooms. It's all a little flat, a little perfunctory.That not-quite-there sense permeates the film. The sense that this could have been something is borne out by the participation of great collaborators like cinematographer Robert Elswit, and a cast that includes Edgar Ramirez, (a wasted) Bryce Dallas Howard, Corey Stoll, and Bill Camp.Somehow, despite promising readings, they strike not gold, but copper.",Gold
63,jaapeelman,Very good movie,8,28 July 2017,"Once again Matthew McConaughey is playing a superb role as gold-digger Kenny Wells, who travels to Indonesia to persuade a geologist to look for gold with him. After a lot of trouble and malaria they apparently succeed. Off course than the big guys want a piece of the action and some scheming is going on. Finally it turns out that it is all a big fraud which has been set up by the geologist. Wells is questioned by the FBI but they believe he is innocent. The final scene is just brilliant. I saw this movie at home but it is one of the best movies I have seen in a few months. A lot of the blockbuster-movies like the Mummy etc are a piece of crap compared to Gold.

There were quite a few of the same notes as The Founder from earlier this month, just not as well executed. Matthew Mcconaughey completely committed to this role, but the character isn't very sympathetic. He probably thought the film would be praised far more than it ultimately was. Bryce Dallas Howard was great, but was ultimately wasted in the film. Their performances just weren't enough to elevate the writing and pacing.

67,Ben_Cap,"A Piece of Advice Worth It's Weight in Gold, Don't See This Movie",5,31 January 2017,"I feel that it is my duty that when I review a movie, that I stick around for the entire run and not bail out early even with the bad ones. The Free State of Jones(2016) tested me in this regard eventually forcing me out to hit the eject button and make it home what seemed like weeks after the movie started. I did not write a review for that movie, and the reason I bring it up is that unfortunately Gold gave me the same feeling. Both star Matt McConaughey, who just a few years after his McConnisance has hit a bit of a rough patch, even though it's not necessarily at fault. Both films were birthed from a good piece of history that is not very well known, but both seem to become about more than the original idea, and maybe they should have kept it simple.Gold is actually based on true life events, well that's not exactly true. It takes some elements from a real life event, but Gold should not be taken as historical fact. McConaughey plays Kenny Wells, the heir to a mining company run by his father and started by his grandfather. When we first see Stills the company is booming and his father is alive. Then we jump to 7 years later, Stills Sr. has passed on and it seems the company is on the same boat. Then in one of the worst examples of forcing the main character to get off the couch and start his journey, Stills dreams up a gold deposit in Indonesia, and no that is not word play, he really gets drunk, falls asleep, and dreams up the motivating factor in this movie. Stills then goes to Find Mike Acosta(Edgar Ramirez), who is apparently the real mastermind behind this Indonesian gold mine and together they search for the gold deposit in the rain forest. I have just laid out the most interesting and part of this story and that all takes place in the first act.The news is not all bad, McConaughey is solid in the lead role, but similar to a great player on a bad basketball team it can be difficult to get into a rhythm by yourself. Edgar Ramirez lacks chemistry with McConaughey which was vital for this movie. These two men go through quite a bit together and they never really seemed to click. Bryce Dallas Howard is basically here to give the lead a romantic interest and someone to treat horribly when he inevitably goes off the rails. Side characters are filled with some pretty solid actors such as Corey Stoll and Toby Kebbell, but they basically add up to one role, and neither character is interesting at all.Gold seemed like it wanted to be a mix of a high level stock market drama and a treasure hunt movie with a dash of historical fiction thrown in there. The problem, other than that mix sounds like a terrible idea for a genre, is that the movie never comes close to succeeding in either regard. The plot is terribly uninteresting and none of the characters save for parts of McConaughey's performance are in any way redeeming. I had expected it to be rough when it was completely skipped over in every year end list but I did not expect this. There is nothing I can say is remotely worth your time here. There are plenty of other places to see good McConaughey performances where he does not look gross and out of shape. After these last two stinkers(which both are probably in the running for the worst movies I have seen in the last year) Mr. McConaughey should think about he chooses his roles. Skip Gold and see something else, I beg of you.",Gold
68,roguegrafix,Hilarious Comedy,2,25 February 2017,"As a geologist, this film was one gut-busting laugh after another. Hilarious! Interesting to see Hollywood's take on how to conduct gold exploration in Indonesia --NOT!.Where do I start? From the Ring of Fire ""Theory"" -- ha ha ha: it's geographical description first year geology students would be aware of -- or the decision to place a drill hole by simply getting to the top of a ridge and banging the ground with your walking stick? Finding a mine on ""an eighth of a ounce""? Or delineating the field by radial drilling? People, even rogue prospectors put in more groundwork before deciding to drill. Drilling is the last stage of exploration and follows months, if not years of geological mapping and sampling of an area. Once field samples are analysed, the target area is further defined by digging and sampling costeans or trenches on a grid layout. To decide to drill is a monumental decision because of the expense and diamond core drilling (the drilling done in the film) is really expensive--probably around $500 or more per metre. And their ""great quality safeguards"" as seen in the film -- people tossing core around all over the place were rubbish. Each drill hole is logged by a geologist -- i.e he physically examines every inch of core and I saw no-one doing that in the film.Then we have a mine on an eighth of an ounce. I.e roughly 4 grams per tonne -- not bad for a medium-quality open-cut mine but for the ""hard rock"" underground mine they were preparing to open, you need at least 2 or 3 times that to make it worthwhile. Some African gold mines have 15-20 grams per tonne. And at 4 grams per tonne, you would not see gold with the naked eye.So if you're a geologist you'll have a real belly hoot laugh from beginning to end. Sadly, this lack of science just spoiled the film for me.",Gold

Look no further than this movie for compelling evidence to the contrary. That the mere potential for discovering a rich seam of the yellow metal beneath our feet has us all a quiver.There are many different angles from which one could review this film, most of which can't be explored in a review that implores you to watch it unburdened by any prior knowledge of the subject matter.However, the main angle for me is one that is easily shared either pre or post watching this great movie.

72,showmethemoviescontact,Gold ShowMeTheMovies Review,6,25 February 2017,"Matthew McConaughey reprises his role from The Wolf of Wall Street to present us with a repetitive storyline which doesn't make the most of its source material.I kid, of course; Kenny Wells (McConaughey) is not actually the same character as Mark Hanna from The Wolf Of Wall Street. However, if you were to put the film side by side with Gold, then there would be many moments I would be unable to tell the difference; bar McConaughey's receding hairline in the more recent movie.Gold has a plot loosely following a true story; two men who find a gold mine in Indonesia which was predicted to be the largest gold find of the decade. The sequential events involve big-time stockbroker involvement and multi-billion dollar investments into Kenny Wells' company following his discovery along with Michael Acosta (Edgar Ramirez). The plot doesn't offer much else, and has tendencies of being repetitive throughout the storyline.The trouble with the adaptation of a true story into a movie is that films are not often representative of real life in many ways; directors are often tasked with a perplexing decision: stay as true as possible to the story or dramatise and exaggerate for the sake of the audience's enjoyment? Gold does not achieve an effective balance at all, in an attempt to remain as true as possible to the real life story of the Bre-X mining scandal (all bar a couple of scenes added in to create tension).As a result, the movie shows an up-down-up-down relationship with the plot, unable to decide where the storyline is actually going to go, and while this is much like how reality operates, no one has a sublime story arc in real life - it does not make for a great film. The amount of times in the film that Kenny Wells is celebrating how rich he has become, then losing all of his money, then getting it back again only to lose it once more... you get my point.It is a shame that this was the case because it seems like this role was practically written for McConaughey, he clearly relished his opportunity to perform as Wells, but his character does still lack originality. To mention it again, moments of the film where the company are celebrating the fact they've made a lot of money on the stock market floor and when the main cast are calling up potential investors and essentially lying to them to obtain a greater investment, look basically ripped from The Wolf of Wall Street.Gold is not a bad movie - it is merely mediocre. When I find myself not caring about the characters during their times of need or desperation, they must not be written very well. In fact, most are completely forgettable other than the main two cast members. I can't particularly justify a reason to go and watch the film other than to kill time, it didn't have a great deal to offer.",Gold

Balding anti hero, red head love interest and short cut to riches story set in the 1980's. 'American Hustle' must have been such a breakout hit that it green lighted all similar scripts. McConaughey's character in this film is a cross between Tom Cruises 'Les Goldman' from Tropic Thunder and Christian Bale's 'Irving Rosenfeld' from American Hustle. There may even be a poor man's Jerry Macguire thrown in for good measure. It is all too familiar. Strangely Tom Cruise is set to also release a film soon with a rags to riches story line set in the 1980's called....wait for it ''American Made''. McConaughey's love interest also happens to have red hair and is a poor version of Amy Adams. Come to think of it this brings to mind Jessica Chastain ( a red head ) in ''A Most Violent Year'' set in 1981! How many of these Scarface-esque characters and story lines can be sustained? The movie is just not interesting enough to hold your attention for very long and doesn't have the same kind of excitement or humour that American Hustle has so I give it a 2.

The 2 hours flew by as the story, based on real events, takes us to Indonesia to look for a gold mine. The events come to life on the screen, real and authentic – from fighting malaria and mud, to the deals made in the high-rise offices of Manhattan's suited investors. McConaughey especially surprised me with his Woody Harrelson-look as a disheveled alcoholic and gold mining addict. I waited for his transformation to heart-throb, and it came in different ways. McConaughey's fake tooth, greasy hair, potbelly, and unshaven face destroy my lady's man image, remnants of the J-lo movies. But it shows his professionalism as an actor. In Gold, McConaughey is a man's man and becomes Kenny Wells, friend to Mike Acostas – a mining geologist. These characters clash in both looks and goals throughout the movie. The acting is so well performed that you feel the characters' elation when they find gold, sadness when the money is gone, and the frustration of not reaching their dreams. The end makes sense.

The movie itself was fantastically shot with amazing props and costumes representing the 80's era perfectly. Something else that caught my ears was the amazing soundtrack.

99,wisal-albulushi,"Beautiful values, but boring",5,22 February 2017,"The movie is about pursuing a dream and believing in yourself. Matthew McConaughey, who played the main character, was convincingly showing the passion and the desire to make his dream come true. The movie started off very weak, then it improved after about 15 minutes. The movie script contains valuable meanings; however they were not well addressed in the boring repetition and details.",Gold
100,markd_weinberg,Brilliant Performances.....,8,28 April 2017,"McConaughey delivers a great performance in this one. The story is good, the script is better, the filmography is great and its based on a true story (although stretched out a bit). Check it out, you won't be disappointed. Unrated on IMDb but when you look at the reason's why, its not justified. This was a great effort of a film from the filming to the music and acting. Thumbs up!",Gold
101,therealbenz,More than GOLD,8,3 September 2017,"With a very deep voice that'll reach you, ""A bird with no feet sleeps in the wind"", just one of the quotes that'll have you think and not just watch. This picture is an experience that can teach a thing or two. The protagonist Kenny Wells has that connection with everyone, including those unattractive occasions in your life. It is rare for me to be sitting at the edge of my seat while a film is ending this one has put itself into that category. Gold isn't just Gold it's something you might want to live.",Gold

If you liked Blow, or Wolf of Wall Street... this is just as good! Maybe not so deep story, but still, amazing Matthew does what he's supposed to.Don't follow the ratings and check this out!",Gold
105,vivekjain-13-24832,McConaughey the 'GOLD'en guy,7,13 July 2017,"First of all McConaughey the only guy runs this movie. I liked the plot,actually McConaughey takes this average plot to an 7/10 with his performance. Movie never slows down, that is the good thing.McConaughey always get into the character that makes you feel like how desperate was that guy to find GOLD. I was expecting a lot from Edgar Ramírez but he couldn't deliver as per the role he got here but don't worry McConaughey will not gonna waste your time. I would recommend it for those who are in dilemma due to the overall rating this movie has got; this will not waste your time.",Gold
106,tifo-19097,Good Movie,7,22 February 2017,"It is a movie, which is gives you a good idea about the mining industry in that time (eighties). Mackonhey and Ramirise make a good performance. The story is moderate and directing also. The end is marvelous. worth to be seen, but it is not a master peace, it just a good movie.",Gold
107,mwinglunchan,Actually a pretty entertaining movie,8,21 March 2017,"I actually thought this was a pretty good movie, despite the relatively low ratings. Both McConaughey and Ramírez played very well, also good to see Stoll in this movie. The story was entertaining, never a dull moment (unlike Moonlight, sorry, but that was really boring and I believed the rave reviews...). Anyway, it was worth seeing it!",Gold

109,Spinetinglers-UK,McConaughey is the glitter in a film without much gold,7,27 January 2017,"Longing for the American dream should never be inextricable from the determination of an individual. Dreaming about achieving a goal should go hand in hand with proactively doing it. Without veering off on a transcendentalist tangent, let me introduce Kenny Wells. Wells is a pot-bellied, greased up chain smoking alcoholic, perhaps uncomfortably seen as the heir to the throne of the Washoe Mining Company based in 'the biggest little city in the world' and where Johnny Cash sang of a prisoner shooting a man, 'just to watch him die'. The one and only, Reno, Nevada. So maybe I haven't painted Wells in such a great light so far. He certainly isn't the godchild of Emerson, but that's what director Stephen Gaghan appears to try and convey. This is Oscar winner Matthew McConaughey as you've never witnessed before, presented in a way that's far from an idealised sharp-suited image of the American dreamer and stoically opposed to Ron Woodward's skeletal frame in his winning performance in 2013's 'Dallas Buyers Club'. However, he's the film's gleaming treasure in a somewhat clichéd quest for glory, even if the main aesthetic shine is only from his forehead in an Indonesian jungle.'Gold' is loosely based upon the Bre-X mining scandal of 1993 with Gaghan confusingly transporting us straight back to the 1980s to a world of questionable suits, post-punk, Iggy Pop and the romantic aspirations of Wells. His journey is somewhat instigated by the death of his father, luring him further into the volatile and unpredictable world of gold mining, conducting the train through its successes and abrupt halts. From the smoky testosterone filled bars of Reno to the sweat inducing tropics of Borneo, we realise how integral McConaughey's performance is to the success and believability of the narrative. Although somewhat charismatic through his wittiness and general naivety to the overall project, Kenny Wells is a man who is out to make money. Wells' sidekick, geologist Michael Acosta (Edgar Ramirez), is bestowed with elements of morality and spirituality, clearly seen in his proactive interaction with the Indonesian people. So therefore, Wells' financial determination combined with Acosta's endearing qualities and intelligence make the relationship such a strong focal point of the film. The strength of the characters makes the adventure seem almost tangible, yet still questionable.Looking at McConaughey's transformation, you may just begin to question how Kaylene (Bryce Dallas-Howard) has fallen for such a downtrodden hopeless wanderer. However it's her innocent undying belief in him that makes Wells' decline even more forceful. There is an essence of the childhood sweetheart in her demeanour, the archetypal support mechanism to Kenny's weaknesses. Yes, she rides on the wave of success to its highest heights with Wells, lavishing herself in material riches but in a way, she is the moral spine of the film, never losing sight of the real Kenny Wells she's grown up loving. Kaylene acts just as much as the voice of reason as Michael Acosta and it is the combination of powerful relationships that we will really take away from the screen. The dizzying heights of financial success ultimately lead to a strenuous, yet somewhat predictable breakdown between Kenny and Kaylene and we can't help but feel like she is completely unworthy of any of it. Whiskey plus money plus the inability to maintain your dignity. Well you know the rest. That's not saying Kenny Wells is a vile person, despite his, for want of a better term, shabby look. We're willing everything to work out for both of them, yet the American dream just becomes too much to handle.McConaughey's character compared to the regimental sharp suited Wall Street bankers is a deliberate contrast by Gaghan. Our willingness for the sugar coated American dream to work out is pitted against the cold-hearted capitalist intentions of Brian (Corey Stoll). Wells' resilience to counteract an offer made by Stoll and his legion of top button fastened, tight tied troubadours, can only be admired. The ambition to fight against globalisation, to hold onto your dreams, to recapture lost determination and to let nothing stand in your way in fighting for what you want, is made believable through McConaughey's stellar performance. However, in what should be an adventure full of undying speed to keep up with the lustful desire for success, the film's narrative is too slow to match the pace of Wells' dreams. McConaughey is the glitter in a film without much gold.",Gold
110,LordManhattan,"A lot of content, not a lot of substance",7,22 April 2017,"First of, Gold is better than its IMDb rating and meta-score. I feel this movie is a victim of the studio going wild with a pair of scissors, trying to make it short(er) (even at 2 hours) to please the mainstream audience, but while doing that, this movie loses a lot of substance. Character development is lacking, apart from our protagonist, so it doesn't really feel like we get to know them. One moment we have a new (seemingly an important) character, and then he or she will either disappear or roam in the background. I guess that happens when you start cutting. I suspect there's a great version of this movie out there, and I'd rather watch a 3 hour version with everything included, than this. The movie also takes place in the late 80's(?) or early 90's, but I don't feel like time was important here, which makes things a little confusing. I have no idea if they've been at something for a week, a month, or five years. The whole movie also feels a little rushed in the sense that it tries to get to the end as quickly as possible. It lacks the details; Slow down a little, speak to us, breathe. I want to know more, I want to see more, but it ends up being a National Geographic article instead of a book. It's far from bad though, and it's an enjoyable watch. Just don't go in expecting a masterpiece.",Gold

112,mugi-18651,A Must See,9,18 January 2017,"This is a great movie and incredibly entertaining. Given the director's past films (Traffic, Syriana) there is no question why he was brought on to tell this incredibly complex story - and he did an amazing job. if you are not familiar with the real story you are also in for a real treat. And for all of you men that are feeling a little overweight after too much alcohol over the holiday, leave it to McConaughey to make us feel slim and sober again. But, for me Ramirez and Stoll stole the show... wow! They were both great, you couldn't take your eyes off of Ramirez, and every scene Stoll was in he made you feel like you were there with him. Net, net, don't miss this one...",Gold
