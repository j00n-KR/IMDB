0,SnoopyStyle,intriguing premise sappy execution,6,7 January 2020,"Stella Grant (Haley Lu Richardson) suffers from cystic fibrosis and spends most of her life getting treatment in hospitals. Even a lung transplant would only last about 5 years. As a precaution, patients are required to stay six feet apart to prevent cross infections. Poe (Moises Arias) is her gay best friend and Barb (Kimberly Hebert Gregory) is the protective head nurse. Stella falls for fellow patient Will Newman (Cole Sprouse) but they are forced to stay apart.The premise seems intriguing. I don't have any experience with CF so I don't know the reality. The use of video blog seems to have replaced the education film as the exposition dump. I still like the films more. They allow for clearer expositions. One can quickly dump and move on. In this movie, Will could be forced to sit through the film which he faints interest. The video blog thing can sap intensity without knowing it. For example, she talks about five feet with the pool cue for her blog when it would be infinitely more powerful to do it in front of Will. This movie does a great job transitioning from the blog to Will. It still creates a distance between the characters. With a premise that already creates that distance, the movie needs to work harder to physically connect the two young people. Ok! Boomer. Sure, I'm old and the blog is meant to project the reality of youth. Their closeness heightens the danger. Physical touch is the water for Jaws. As for Romeo and Juliet, it screams for a tragic ending. Despite some intriguing ideas, it falls to the two lovely leads to maintain chemistry. These are lovely actors and this is a nice ""cancer ward"" romance.",Five Feet Apart
1,nogodnomasters,Breathing Borrowed Air,4,4 May 2019,"This is another dying teens love story. They don't have cancer and run off to Europe and have sex. They have cystic fibrosis (CFers) and show each other their scars at a distance. Stella (Haley Lu Richardson) is a bit of a basket case and wants to save the world from Saint Grace hospital using an experimental drug waiting for some organ donor nearby of the same blood type to get decapitated in a car accident. She takes a shine to another CFer who is a bit of an MFer. But as always, she changes him because women always think they can change men.For me, love is never having to watch another dying teen love story. UGH! Like ""Twilight"" and ""Will Ferrell"" people will say how great it was and then grow out it and say, ""I can't believe I liked that.""",Five Feet Apart
2,kosmasp,Perspective and represantation,6,15 July 2021,"I just read a review that is from a person that actually has CF. And it reads genuine, not like someone who craves attention or just plain lies about it. That person overall likes the movie and thinks the represantation and the mostly accurate depiction of certain things (therapy and so forth) weigh more than the fact that the movie goes Hollywood on us. Romantic drama Hollywood that is - apparently there are other movies that get a lot more wrong.So who am I to dispute that or say something different? I am glad that person feels that way and I hope that is true for others who watch this. That being said, I would not be honest to myself or anyone else if I wouldn't rate this the way it felt to me. And the cliches that are being used, the predictability of it all and the fact that the movie ... well goes Hollywood on us, is something I can't leave outside my review and rating overall.The actors do their best with what they got and while it is tough for someone who doesn't have the experience of what they go through to know or understand all their reactions, we as viewers may understand certain feelings because they are human. Being closed away is one thing - wanting to break free or bend the rules another - one that has to thought about especially considering the risks one will take with it ... the ending is as dramatic and Hollywood as it gets and again something that is to be expected.So depending on your experience and your willingness to suspend your disbelief, you will be able to ""enjoy"" this more or less than others.",Five Feet Apart
3,Quinoa1984,A wonderful performance tops a mediocre sick-love story,5,7 April 2019,"As others have noted already, Hayley Lu Richardson is not only the part of this movie that holds it together, she single-handedly makes a (at *best/least*) two dimensional John Green rip-off (do we call this Greensploitation?) feel genuine and heartfelt and rising above the cliches. It may be that she just stands out so wholly because the rest of the cast is just competent and OK (including Cole Sprouse, who seems to have tried to channel a young American version of the form of Richard E Grant, and would have succeeded had he not been so bland), but she is simply one of those small revelations right now in the movies: charisma and charm but a seriousness and depth of soul that balances out the adorable quality. It's an A minus performance in a C plus film.... Oh, I'm sorry, did I say C plus? Um... Well, look, this movie does some good things for the first half to two thirds when it tries to not be so melodramatic and the characters can interact and the script gives some decent lines to two sick lovebirds... Not to say it isn't fighting against two giant types, one sorta muted (Black Sassy Nurse), but not too bad because she's, also a flaw as a missed opportunity, underdeveloped and underused as a full person in this story, and then, hold on folks, the (in Patton Oswalt voice) GAY BEST FRIEEEEEEEND!Like... C'mon, writers, this is what we have in 2019 (and just a month or so after Isnt it Romantic?) The gay dude who is there to literally be the sound-board for our leading lady (and sometimes leading artist-bro)? And maybe, for a moment or two, the filmmakers try to give him a little dramatic weight, but that gets deflated once his fate is revealed (spoiler: he also gets that bit where he gets to say to someone at a party, ""oh I cant wait to see so and so next week"" and I just put my hands over my face saying, ""oh no, not *this* old gag"").But I tried with Five Feet Apart, and to the director's and writer's credit they were trying (somewhat, but points all the same, like giving out gold stars and so on) to give this some pathos, and surrounded by the physical component of Cystic Fibrosis, where the characters can't touch and have to be in this space away from each other, and if I wasnt fully engaged like with a Green YA medical-sad-amusing romance I was at least letting it take me along and wasn't all that stupid and infuriating a journey (save for the occasional ""ill brood on the roof ala My Sister's Keeper).....But then the last fifteen minutes happen, and it turns into complete BS theatrics and hysterical nonsense, with sudden twists, a decision by a character that simply doesnt make sense based on what we have known about (spoiler) CPR *FOR DECADES*, and a final scene that you can tell the filmmakers are practically screaming from a bullhorn by the video village on set ""CRY you're gonna CRY NOW RIGHT? Flow my tears, the carpetbaggers said!"" But.... Yeah, no, this is all rushed hooey.If this kind of movie with a melancholy soundtrack and amiable and more or less talented leads and a warm and too gooey for its own good heart appeals to you, then go ahead and check it out once it's invariably on Lifetime in two months. Otherwise, you'll be left pondering a couple of things while not necessarily paying 100% attention to the plot, such as a) why doesn't Stella have anymore OCD after, oh, about an hour into this when it was clearly established as a key part of her character early on (and I know As Good As It Gets did that a little too, but not like this); and b) whatever happened to Claire Forlani? Hmm.",Five Feet Apart
4,neil-476,Engaging,8,1 April 2019,"Stella is a bright, breezy 17-year old, in hospital for a regular ""tune up"", necessary as a cystic fibrosis patient. Fortunately, she is a keen blogger, and her blogs give us the main information we need to appreciate what follows - the prognosis that most sufferers die by the age of 30, and that sufferers should never get within 6 feet of each other for fear of infection. So when Stella encounters fellow CF patient (and wilful free spirit) Will, it is only a matter of time before they fall for each other. And they can't even kiss.""Disease of the week"" movies are far from unknown and, more often than not, they are cross-pollinated with teen romance, as is the case here. Having said that, this is not bad of its kind. Haley Lu Richardson and Cole Sprouse are attractive - perhaps too attractive - as the leads. Moises Arias pleases as Poe, another CF patient, and is a world apart from the character he played in Ender's Game.The plot meanders away from the expected every now and then, although this is not an illness where happy endings are commonplace. The film is often emotional without too much blatant manipulation. The thing which saddened me most was the fact that these two young people in love are never able to kiss. Heartbreaking.",Five Feet Apart
5,ferguson-6,Rising star Haley Lu shines again,7,15 March 2019,"Greetings again from the darkness. The all-too-familiar sick/dying teenager genre is frequently associated with Lifetime Channel movies or something of that ilk. What sets this one apart (and above) many in the slew of similarly themed movies is the script, and more so, two outstanding lead performances. Director Justin Baldoni is best known as an actor and director of TV projects, but he (mostly) handles the script from Mikki Daughtry and Tobias Iaconis quite well.Rising star Haley Lu Richardson (COLUMBUS, SPLIT) plays Stella, a teenager who has been dealing with Cystic Fibrosis (CF) her entire life. When we first meet her, she has checked back in to the hospital for a ""tune-up"". Despite her breathing struggles and medical issues, Stella is a shining light of optimism who is friendly with the entire hospital staff and other patients. She's also OCD and maintains a strict regimen on her meds in hopes of hanging on long enough for the holy grail - a lung transplant, or ultimately a miracle cure for this death sentence disease. Stella maintains two to-do lists: one for the day, and another for her bucket list. She also runs a YouTube channel where she educates us on what it's like living with CF.On one of her frequent visits to the hospital nursery to watch the newborn babies, Stella crosses paths with Will (Cole Sprouse), a more cynical CF patient who has B cepacia form - so deadly that sufferers aren't included on the lung transplant list. In contrast to Stella, Will wonders if the hassle of treatment is worth the pain and inconvenience, when so little hope is present. CF patients are required to don gloves, masks, and oxygen packs. One rule that must not be broken is to maintain at least a 6 foot distance at all times between themselves and any other CF patient. The risk of passing along their specific mixture of bacteria is simply too great.'Opposites attract' is in play here as Stella and Will share only one trait, and it's a bond where being too close could literally kill one or both of them. These are smart and interesting characters who understand there are no ""happily ever afters"" in their future. We are along for the ride as they learn more about each other. Will is a talented sketch artist with a wicked sense of humor in his cartoons, while Stella carries a special burden of putting others at ease while focusing on the present and looking to the future, thanks to the exploits of her beloved older sister Abby (Sophia Bernard).Other supporting actors include Claire Forlani as Will's mother, Parminder Nagra (BEND IT LIKE BECKHAM) as the doctor, Kimberly Hebert Gregory as the strict and caring Nurse Barb, and Moises Arias as Poe, a witty gay teenager and fellow CF patient, who has been friends with Stella since they were young kids. As the romance blooms for Stella and Will, there are some too-familiar moments and a couple of lame musical interludes with slow-motion ... but there are also some terrific and heartfelt scenes. In particular, a pool cue at the pool is extraordinarily tender and romantic.The film teases us a few times with assumptions, but the theme of human touch is ever-present. For CF patients, is love selfish or is it an inherent need? 'The lights are like stars' is a nice touch that explains how this disease forces these folks to think a little differently and find joy in the moment ... yet still keep their distance. Sure, Ms. Richardson (a bona fide star in the making) and Mr. Sprouse are a bit too old to be playing teenagers, but their talent allows us to take in the layers here with the disease and the limitations on life. The film has plenty of laughs and plenty of tears (bring your tissue) as we watch a heartfelt romance while also learning some of the challenges facing the 30,000 CF patients in the U.S.",Five Feet Apart
6,ThomasDrufke,Another Star-making Turn From Richardson,6,29 March 2019,"I was hesitant to go and see Five Feet Apart for a few reasons, one being that the marketing material never caught my interest, and the other that this looked like a beat for beat remake of The Fault in Our Stars. That's pretty much exactly what the outcome of the actual product is sadly. However, the one clear standout here is that Haley Lu Richardson's performance is absolutely fantastic. She breaks free from all of the painfully cliched teen sick coming of age elements to give a star turn as Stella. She has great chemistry with Cole Sprouse, though the writing felt far more blatantly formulaic from his mouth than it did with Richardson. This felt very reminscent of Jessica Rothe in Happy Death Day, this realistically should be Richardson's breakout role. Not enough people have seen her previous work. And to put it bluntly, she saved this movie.6.2/10",Five Feet Apart
7,westsideschl,Had Potential,6,28 June 2019,"The complex genetic forms of cystic fibrosis, and range of partial (especially latest) treatments could have used more time in place of the overriding viewer enticing hook of teen love (I know, got to pay the bills.). Liked the presentation of the Burkholderia cepacia bacteria found commonly in the environment bacteria, but also would have liked to know more about it. Anyway, you knew a death was in the works as well as a happy (sort of) closure.",Five Feet Apart
8,ops-52535,emotional,7,27 May 2019,"Cf, a disease i had forgotten due to calcification in my amusing amazing brain, having read about it at nursing college, but here in norway treated just in the most developed hospitals, and they never live to the ageing that usually qualify to my trade, elderly care taking . i have had aids patients, but no cf'ers, alot of kols patients, but theyve usually made the mess at own riskits a good film, lots of ups and downs, the 6 feet rule is bend into 5 feet as the film runs, the acting are great, and the fact sheet pretty well followed.
what hesitates me though are the length of this movie and its passifistic pace of ''action''. there are many movies on the subjhect of '' i just died in your arms tonight'', that i feel have flown instead of still flying.anyway, have a look ,you wont regret it , because the issues are so important and dead serious, and i really melted by the looks of the female lead, especially her hair and the way its styled, just like my wife many years ago, and hers were even better,and still is, so the grumpy old man thinks that you should take care of every moment in your living life, itll soon be over and oblivion will make order.",Five Feet Apart
9,UniqueParticle,Haley Lu Richardson is so beautiful and spectacular!,9,3 January 2020,I didn't know anything about CF but I sure love this film and everything around it!

10,cruise01,Predictable but sweet and emotional.,6,15 June 2019,"Five Feet Apart (3 out of 5 stars).Five Feet Apart is a decent romantic drama that is about two teenagers diagnosed with cystic fibrosis that are stuck in a long treatment in a hospital. While they both fall for each other but with their disease they have to keep a distance from each other. Yes, it is that romantic film that is filled with clichés and sappy dialogue. The film does build some strong emotional connection with what the characters are going through. It may not be as strong as The Fault in our Stars film. It was not as bad.The plot follows Stella (Haley Lu Richardson) who has been diagnosed with cystic fibrosis for a long time. She has OCD and a control freak personality. She keeps all her treatments and medications planned throughout the month. She meets another patient who is also stuck in the hospital for the same treatment as hers. Will (Cole Sprouse) who feels like he has given up all hopes of his condition. He soon falls for her too.This being a romantic film. Yes, it is quite predictable. Two characters falling for each other. And an obstacle with their disease being the problem. And they have to keep a distance with each other which it can be fatal if they are close. Very much cliché as well. When one character decides to make a stupid decision in the end cause they can not go through without the other one being okay too.Haley Lu Richardson did great with her character. She has her charms and the emotions you can feel for her character. As she spends most of her life with treatments. And she hears about her friends going out and travelling. Cole Sprouse was also okay as well.Overall, Five Feet Apart is a fair film. It tries to be an emotional story about people struggling through this disease and falling for each other. The story and direction is cliché and predictable.",Five Feet Apart

12,lisafordeay,If you loved The Fault In Our Stars and Me Before You then you will love this,8,11 September 2019,"Five Feet Apart is a CBS film starting Cole Sprouse and Haley Jo Richardson and tells the tale of 2 young teenagers who suffer from Cystic fibrosis and cannot touch each other as their condition could kill them both. Despite the fact the two fall for each other will they fight it and be together in the end.The story is nice,the acting was top notch and yes I got teary eyed watching it. Both Haley and Cole had amazing chemistry yet half the time I mistook Haley for Emilia Clarke as she looks so much like her.If you are a fan of the movies I mentioned in my title for this review then you will like this film.Also stars Claire Forlani and Moises Arias(who played Rico in Hannah Montana)",Five Feet Apart
13,jtindahouse,An important film to remind people not to take simple things for granted,9,17 April 2020,"I'm a sucker for sad movies I have to admit. It doesn't make any logical sense for humans to want to feel sad, yet for some reason we do. Most of my favourite films of all time are tear-jerkers in one way or another. That being said, I don't typically watch a lot of romance-dramas, however 'Five Feet Apart' caught my eye. The concept of two people falling in love, but not being able to touch each other, intrigued me. I wondered how the film would pull it off and what creative ways they would use to keep the interactions fresh. They always manage to though. Nothing ever feels repetitive. The film impressed me a lot in that sense.The chemistry between the two leads, Haley Lu Richardson and Cole Sprouse, was terrific. Not only were they each extremely likeable, they also interacted very naturally. Younger actors don't always manage to get that right, yet it is crucial to the success of the film that they do. Because without that base the rest of the film collapses. We have to care for the characters and their relationship.The thing I liked most about 'Five Feet Apart' though is the underlying message. The simple things we all take for granted everyday are not available to everyone. Yet we never give them a second thought. I think almost 100% of people on earth under-appreciate their life to some extent. If it takes films like this to remind people of that, then that's a great thing. This is a very sad, but also very important and well made film that I highly recommend people see.",Five Feet Apart
14,jadavix,Better than I expected,7,4 September 2021,"""Five Feet Apart"" is better than I expected. It mostly comes to life due to the central performances of Haley Lu Richardson and Cole Sprouse. The supporting players also do fine work, in particular Moises Arias and Kimberly Hébert Gregory. This, along with what the movie teaches you about CF, is almost enough to carry it past the clichés it predictably employs.I didn't really mind the clichés so much. I did wonder why characters in romance movies always have to hate each other at first sight, and then come to love each other later. What's that about? Is it about giving hope to people who generally dislike the opposite sex on first meeting?The movie does strain credibility with some of the behaviour of its desperately sick protagonists, and I wasn't surprised to hear that whereas some members of the Cystic Fibrosis community praised the movie for raising awareness of the illness, others were worried about the risky behaviour it displayed.The movie looks beautiful, and that, along with its performances, kept it afloat for me.",Five Feet Apart
15,JoBloTheMovieCritic,Five Feet Apart,5,20 July 2019,"5/10 - while it is nice to see a movie that focuses on patients with CF, this subgenre has been done before and much better",Five Feet Apart
16,tadpole-596-918256,Maybe an exception can be made for a few major celebrities . . .,7,20 March 2019,". . . such as ""Steve Hawking,"" who are stricken with rare and expensive inherited conditions AFTER they've made their mark on the world (and who are in no position to pump bad genes into the shallow end of the pool). However, generally speaking, FIVE FEET APART makes the case for ""pulling the plug"" on the run-of-the-pill young and really unhealthy. FIVE FEET APART focuses on the difficult life of ""Stella,"" born with a serious chest defect. As shown around 26:05 and again at 1:06:20, Stella barely can be credited with mosquito bites, struggling mightily to fill up her upper body training lingerie. (This anti-heroine says that she's depressed because her congenital mammary deficit has reduced her lung capacity by 50%.) Stella obsesses over weird dietary supplements, and like her Real Life fellow FLATLINER ""Pepper Dots,"" she tries to foist off her potentially deadly substance abuse habits upon innocent bystanders, such as ""Will."" FIVE FEET APART's villainess spends her days lurking near a maternity ward, plotting for the opportunity to pass her pine-plank physique down to Future Generations. ""Don Juan's"" daughter may have found financing for ""B"" or ""C"" implants after her first 50 bouts with Gray Drapery, but such surgical tinkering only compounds this genetic predisposition for the dispossessed chest by tricking unsuspecting mates into rounds of deflationary procreation. How sad!",Five Feet Apart
17,CubsandCulture,A shameless tearjerker...acting saves the film,7,16 March 2019,"The script to this film is quite bad. It leans into cliches. It makes some pretty melodramatic and repugnant choices in its third act. It repeats the basic medical issues of cystic fibrosis a lot. The exposition isn't even handle in a clever way. (The main character has a YouTube series about cystic fibrosis). The plotting is thoroughly predictable and if you seen the trailer you know where the film is going. I will say the characterizations of Will, Poe, and Stella work. They each have a starkly different orientation towards cystic fibrosis; Will and Stella end up meeting in the middle of their opposite viewpoints. Yes that is a pretty common structure and boy can you feel the writers reaching for your heart strings. Lastly, I suspect cystic fibrosis is misrepresented in the film. I am really surprised this script got shot.The direction is a little better but it does nothing but embrace the soap opera tone of the script. In particular I found the cinematography too glossy to really capture the trials of chronic illness. The direction is traditional and risk adverse. Some of that is because of the script but I feel a more daring director would have done more with various conceits in the script. In particular, a few of the dates sequences could have been different than a montage and a pop song on the sound track. (I hated the soundtrack. It was very pop muzak for the most part).With all of those problems why on Earth am I giving this a positive review? Well it features three of the most well considered and charming performances I have seen in a teen melodrama. Arias as Poe is solid friend character; given Poe's fate Arias' likability and sweetness were very much needed. Sprouse is very tender when Will needs to be. He also captures the free spirited nature of Will with easy charm. He makes a good romantic foil. During the film's big erotic moments Sprouse just oozes sexiness and vulnerability.But above all Richardson owns this film. She makes Stella a person you care about and the character's quirks feel real. The script saddles her with some of the worst lines but she makes them work. She really leans into her character's physical limitations and the resulting material feels authentic. It is an absolutely winning performance. I don't know if that feature alone is enough to see the film, but it was enough for me to enjoy it on the level it was intended.",Five Feet Apart

19,masonfisk,I THINK I NEED MORE SPACE AWAY FROM THIS MOVIE...!,5,24 March 2020,"A YA film adaptation of a popular novel which treads the same water as Everything, Everything or The Fault is in Our Stars from last year starring Cole Sprouse (Riverdale) & Haley Lu Richardson (she one was one of the kidnap victims in Split). We have 2 young people suffering from cystic fibrosis which keeps them isolated from most people (as per the distance spelled out in the title). She has learned to deal w/the disease (as she awaits a lung transplant which will extend her life by a few more years) to the point where the hospital staff lets her self medicate while he is a rich boy undergoing a diagnosis for a variant of his affliction & who's into drawing. The usual meet cute ensues w/both parties by film's end learning to appreciate the finer things in life even though that life will be shortchanged due to some fluke of fate.

20,rgkarim,Five Feet Apart From Other Romance Dramas,8,15 March 2019,"Teenage romance movies always hold special places in a lot of people's hearts, but depending on the decade your familiar with, the elements and presentation are a little different. Eighties brought comedy with emotional drama, nineties was the Nicholas Sparks beginning with the cute, cheesy tactics, early 2000s were all about the Nicholas Sparks, super dramatic stories that hold a lot of places in the hearts of the public. Then came the 2010s and the twist was now romance, but put some type of terminal illness with it to sweeten the deal... So tonight's movie continues this current trend, taking another story in hopes of invoking tears and pulling the heart strings of the audience at the same time.

Nice SurprisesSUMMARY: The latest movie fills the formula of sad, drama meeting the romantic teenage plotlines. Fortunately, the acting is there to bring a fantastic dynamic to latch onto in the form of Cole Sprouse and Harley Lu Richardson. Their chemistry is amazing, bringing the two sides of the romantic cone to life in a very sweet, charming, and surprisingly realistic way. Five Feet Apart takes these characters and does a fantastic job advancing them past the carbon copy templates most of these films do. The supporting cast does a wonderful job of being integrated into the story, their own tales and dynamics meshing well to bring out the main characters in new ways.
Of course the movie somehow manages to add on to the simple romantic story by appreciating other dynamics that can be included in romance movies. The comedy is simple and classy, fitting very well with the tone of the movie without being too forced. For those enjoying symbology in the visual arts, the rooms and works of our proverbial Romeo and Juliet have plenty of artistic bite that is quite impressive to behold, instigating a little jealously in my mind about their artwork.
As for the romance component itself, again I give them props for finding a way to bring love and beauty into a realistic way that was both poetic and fun to behold. Five Feet Apart takes most of the cheese factor out of the romance, and instead makes it an adventure that is fun to go on. The ordeal of the disease contending with the blossoming love is a driving force of the film and somehow manages to be fresh despite how plotted love tales are. Perhaps it is also the surprises that come in at points that assists with keeping the adventure going, finding ways to divert from the film, without going too far away from the tale at hand. With all these components it works very well for me.
DISLIKES:Predictable
Cheesy At Times
Scientific Stretches
The Parent Components?
SUMMARY: No surprise, the movie follows much of the same formula, and my friend and I were able to predict much of the movie based on the trailers we had seen. Fortunately, surprises were able to help with this, but they still held some trouble keeping the romantic movie cheese fest from happening. Five Feet Apart leaves much of the mushy, gushy, Nicholas Sparks like drama that is difficult to get away from, which is a selling point for most going to these movies, but for me could have used a little more spice up.
In addition, some of the scientific plausibility for one with my mindset are difficult to get over in terms of the miracles vs. the statistical chances of the real life. Some of the interactions, primarily in the ending occurring the way it did, was very unrealistic and seeing these miracle moments only added to the cheesy coincidences that this series is famous for. If that's not something that bothers you, no worries on this, but for me this is just something to warrant on. As for the parents, they were okay, but I felt that for something as intense as the themes in this movie, some more involvement would be seen. Five Feet Apart's weakest characters are actually the parents, reduced to a few lines of dialogue and the background images. Sure, it's not about them, but in the other films similar to this, the parents were very active in the support of the kids. What happened here?
The VERDICT:Overall, Five Feet Apart was much better than I had anticipated, with a lot more heart, artistic beauty, and adventure than many of the romance/dramas that I've seen. A strong cast, character usage, and surprises in terms of comedy and plot were the selling points for this reviewer in regards to this film. It still has predictability and cheese factors, primarily in the scientific stretches, but the good far outweighs the bad for me in regards to this category of movies. I think this is one for the theater in regards to dramas. If not check this one out for a rent/stream because it's got the heart that movies are known to have.My scores are:Drama/Romance: 8.0

24,rockman182,Five Feet Apart (2019),5,17 March 2019,"I feel this time of year we usually get a teen romantic film. Last year we got Love, Simon around this time. That film was actually pretty solid. Had to kind of role my eyes at this when I saw the trailer but I ended up watching it to learn more about people with cystic fibrosis and how the disease effects their everyday functioning. I was into the first hour of this film but some of the character decision making and hammy romantic elements ruin the latter portion of a film. A film that is truly anchored by its Haley Lu Richardson's performance.The film is about two people at a hospital with cystic fibrosis. The disease is so dangerous if you already have the disease so co carriers need to stay six feet apart, as to not infect each other with bacteria. The two strike up a romance and learn about each other and what how the disease and the idea of dying impacts their lives. They learn to love each other but cannot even touch each other which makes things difficult. The film also co stars Cole Sprouse of Riverdale fame.This film isn't very good. Haley Lu Richardson's performance is really good though. I noticed a bit of her talent first in The Edge of Seventeen but this is the first time I got to see her take a leading role. I also found it interesting to learn a bit more about a disease that I had previously only known of in name. The film goes through the motions after a while and some of the plot points are predictable. Believe it or not the film could have ended respectfully had it not gone down a terribly cringe route.I know its a movie but the characters going against logic at times was hard to ignore. They place themselves in a dumb situation which leads to some of the most hammy romantic dialogue and moments that made the theater laugh. Yeah, that's not good for a film that's trying to be serious. Its not something you need to see unless yo are really curious and want to sit through a subpar and inferior version of The Fault in Our Stars.5/10",Five Feet Apart
25,tm-sheehan,A pleasant surprise and so well acted,7,12 April 2019,"My Review- Five Feet Apart . My rating 7/10It's really refreshing when you don't know any of the actors in a movie and they impress you with their performances and sincerity.Haley Lu Richardson I discover I have seen before in Split the James Mc Evoy thriller playing one of the terrified kidnap victims and she was very good in that film also .This time she co stars as Stella with Cole Bruce as Will and Mouses Arias as Poe a stand out role who gets some great scenes.This trio of young teenagers all have cystic fibrosis and are undergoing treatment in hospital that can't save them but may give them some extra years of life .Stella and Will eventually fall in love after a bumpy start to their relationship while Poe is Stella's childhood friend and confidante who happens to be gay and about to turn 18 when the American health system deems that now you're on your own now and must finance your own health treatment.It's an unusual love story and makes you aware of the plight that people with any disability or infectious or terminal disease go through. In this case they can't touch each other at all hence the title Five Feet Apart because of the risk of deadly infectious bacteria from each other but they still can fall in love and experience all the emotions and senses except touch.It may sound a depressing film , it's not I found it very uplifting funny in parts sentimental in others and extremely well acted and I'll look out for these 3 young actors in the future.",Five Feet Apart

27,Azanspy,This could have been one of the best romantic movies of the year.,7,16 June 2019,"I was thinking why critics and most audiences are giving mostly unfavourable reviews after watching the first 60 minutes or so. It was so good in the beginning. Really good introduction to the characters and very good memorable scenes were there in the first half. But the second half was so bad comparing to the first. I felt liks another director is directing the second half. If the first half was filled with fresh scenes, the second was full of clichés. Still I recommend every romantic movie lovers to watch Five Feet Apart. Haley Lu Richardson was outstanding. She was just brilliant in every single scene. The remaining cast was just good. It could have been one of my favourite romantic movies if they followed how they made the first half rather than turing into a cliché one.",Five Feet Apart

29,sweidman-28016,Typical Romance,6,4 April 2019,"Five Feet Apart:Five Feet Apart is about a pair of teenagers with cystic fibrosis who meet in a hospital and fall in love. I wasn't going to see this but then when every 14 year old girl walked out of the theater sobbing I thought I would see it. I saw it and that's about it. The plot is literally like ever disease romance movie that's come out in the past 5 years starting with The Fault in Our Stars. Except this time they have cystic fibrosis. It wasn't awful it's just that it was the same stuff over and over again with no surprises. So the best part of the movie was Haley Lu Richardson. I really like her and I think she's a good actress. She made her character, Stella, her own and I liked her a lot. Though her character was typical I still liked her. Kimberly Herbert Gregory as Nurse Barb was funny and she seemed to use logic rather than impulse. Now everybody was freaking out since Cole Sprouse was in this. I was interested to see what his career after The Suite Life on Decl brought. He literally annoyed me so much. There was no emotion since he was supposed to be edgy and it was too much. That's about it for the noticeable acting. The soundtrack contained a lot of indie love songs, some even from The Fault in Our Stars, which was typical but I did enjoy some. There were a few cool shots with the camera. Honestly not much to say. I did focus on the audience quite a bit while watching. The girls were all crying and stuff but I laughed since it wasn't anything new and they were just sobbing. There were enjoyable and touching moments though. If you're someone who likes these kinds of movies I'm sure you'll have a good time. If you're looking for quality however, this won't be your movie.My Grade: C+",Five Feet Apart

31,jamiedarlow-37510,Brilliantly acted!,8,28 March 2020,"One that your heartstrings will need some serious recovery after watching! The story follows Stella (Haley Lu Richardson) a girl born with Cystic Fibrosis, who while on a medicinal drug trial in hospital meets a boy named Will (Cole Sprouse) with the same condition. While getting to know each other, they fall in love although can't get too close to each other without risk of spreading bacteria and reducing their life span. They need to find a way to be able to be in each others company without their lives being at stake. Very much in the vein of The Fault In Our Stars which has spawned a whole new sub genre within the teenage romantic drama, this one manages to stand up there on a par with last year's great Midnight Sun. The script has moments that when thinking about it on paper are incredibly corny to the point of contrivance but it's testament to how well made the film is that you get past that and get completely engaged in the characters. I think its highlight are the performances; Richardson is a instantly likeable and phenomenal lead and Sprouse, although you're unsure of what you feel about Will at the start, brings a performance that blossoms over the running time. The entire cast are great with plenty of heartfelt performances from Moises Arias (Enders Game, Nacho Libre) as Stella's best friend Poe to Kimberly Hebert Gregory as head nurse Barb. It has stayed with me a while after watching; there are genuinely upsetting scenes and the overall theme of the film I think is positivity in the face of doom-laden circumstances. It also raised my awareness of the life-threatening disease which I had not known enough about beforehand; very well portrayed. The romantic aspects of the film may not work 100% of the time when the love is more plainly addressed but shines in the more discreet and tender moments! A heartbreaking but lovely portrayal of human connection and inner peace in trying times",Five Feet Apart

33,aminifatimaaa,intense story of love & death,8,24 June 2019,"Five Feet Apart is an emotionally compelling and deeply poignant teen drama that borders on conventional melodramatic levels.

34,coombsstephen,A good film but a tough watch as a parent,7,23 March 2019,This is film is probably aimed at teenagers rather than their parents but it's not a bad film even watching as a parent.The subject is quite a novel one which does work and is well acted. It does give a bit of an insight into youngsters in that position and is rightly focused on them rather than those around them.But be warned this is not a feel good film it was a tough watch as the plot develops and it just seemed to find your emotions then stamp on them....Hard.,Five Feet Apart
35,zac-04879,Quite a Sappy Tale That Just Doesn't Live up to the Hype,5,22 June 2021,"Five Feet Apart is another bland, predictable and average sick-teens-romance-drama that earns a sincere disliking. Despite the painfully heartbreaking performances by Haley Lu Richardson, Cole Sprouse, and honestly pretty much the entire cast, this film is obviously very dramatic and incredibly overrated. Both the story and pace do not live up to any of the hype.This tedious novel adaptation is exactly what you'd call a ""sick-teens-in-romance"" kind of film. The story follows two flat characters played by Haley Lu Richardson and Cole Sprouse who meet each other and just start loving each other's company. A pretty typical idea for a romance film. However, Five Feet Apart is slightly different as it focuses on the love between two cystic fibrosis patients which makes the story a little more fascinating. But as the title and genre suggests, there's a lot of dramatic and sometimes sorrowful moments.It's a real pity that the love, ideas and acting is completely demolished by how slow the film is. You don't have to have any liking for this movie just because it's about the romance between two CF patients.Not only is this romantic drama slow, but it also seems like it's now an unoriginal idea. Every romance film is just two delightful people meeting, enjoying each other, becoming partners, and sometimes getting sexual in higher rated films. The performances and CF idea are the only really pleasing elements of the story, but it's still another forgettable, dull and unoriginal drama.If you liked this review, check out the full review and other reviews at aussieboyreviews.",Five Feet Apart

39,mr_bickle_the_pickle,Very cliched,6,15 March 2019,"It is super cliched and you can tell where the story is going to go. He's the rebellious kid and she's the goody two shoes. She learns to live a little, and of course tragedy will strike. The thing is, despite the tropes it could have been a good movie if the characters were a bit more fleshed out and did stuff that made sense every once in awhile. Theres one scene where the Nurse warns Will (Cole Sprouse) about not getting too close and how she had 2 patients in the past that were in love and ended up dying and she's not going to let that happen again. And so Will decides to ignore Stella's (Haley Lu Richardson) calls the next day and basically not be near her to ensure she survives. And Stella's plan is to is to say F U to Cystic fibrosis by ""taking one foot back"" and saying that they should stay 5 feet apart instead of 6 like instructed. And Will is suddenly like ""Oh heck yeah"". Which makes the heart to heart with the Nurse suddenly meaningless. Which not to mention the whole 5 feet apart plan is kind of dumb to begin with since there were definitely times before where they were less than 6 feet apart. And she also apparently inspired by this plan by looking at a hand washing poster? And thats not the only time where characters seem to flip flop on their emotions/decisions.
And theres another scene that kind of felt meaningless too. And this is spoiler-y although considering the tropes isnt too hard to guess, but her friend Poe ends up dying. She seemingly is a mess for maybe like 30 min before deciding that she ""wants to live"" and takes this romantic stroll with Will to ""see the lights"". Not only does she go from sad and angry to happy quickly (considering this was her supposed best friend) but his death is never brought up again. And it just feels cheap. I also dont buy that they fell in love this quickly either, but whatever thats common in movies.It certainly isnt the worst movie ever and I feel like the actors were doing the best with what what they were given and there are some parts that are nice and touching but you could probably wait to see this film. Its not anything special.",Five Feet Apart

41,cgearheart,The Faux in Our Stars,4,30 April 2019,"Down to the sick teens in love to the use of M83s ""Wait"", this movie is a shameless and obvious ripoff of The Fault in Our Stars.
The plot is simple: two teens with Cystic Fibrosis fall in love but can't touch each other or else they die. I would've felt a lot more emotional with this film if it wasn't so corny and poorly delivered (I can't take Cole Sprouse seriously when he's trying to act romantic; it comes off as super insincere and comedic). I find this especially sad because my cousin/best friend suffers from CF and it breaks my heart whenever I see her back in the hospital, but this just seemed phoned in. It tried to be sincere but it was knee deep in Velveeta cheese. When Stella fell through the ice, I was less scared for her and more frustrated with how stupid she was acting. The other thing that didn't make sense was easily they fell in love and how the two suddenly switch roles (Stella goes from over protective to rebellious and vice versa for Will). It kinda ticked me off, honestly. The biggest highlight of the film was Haley Lu Richardson, who deserves better roles than this.D+",Five Feet Apart

You might need a box of tissues when watching this movie. It makes you cry a lot. All of the character who are not family, nurse, doctors and other things like that are all sick. I don't have the disease that the character do so I don't know how realistic there portray of it is. But to me who knows a little bit about it. They seem to have done a good job on it. They did a great job making you care about the people in the movie. The romance was great too. They had great chemistry together. All of the actor did a great job on the film.

I never really knew about CF too much but this movie taught me how hard it is. The acting was astonishing! I have to give kudos to these actors for making it look like there were a CFer. Also the props looked great. The things I didn't like though is how it was pretty predictable. From the beginning I knew what was going to happen.

This movie just tries way WAY too hard to make you cry. I am sick of people using ""cancer"" or other terminal illness in movies just to make you feel sad.REMEMBER that South Park Episode about the crack babies, and how they put sad music over crack babies playing basketball just to get some sadness from people? This movie is just like that episode, but way way worst and not as creative as South Park at all.This is only meant for people who think that real life ""love"" is like what you see in a fairy tale story.

51,JankiSharma,Life is full of measurements,10,17 March 2019,"Director Justin Baldoni's movie Five Feet Apart is about the lives of mainly three young teenagers diagnosed with cystic fibrosis and their lives in (mostly) and out of hospital. Haley Lu Richardson as Stella is terrific . She is organized and manages to keep up with nurses medication schedule and her doctor Dr Humid( Parminder Nara from Bend it like Beckham) instructions. Stella is on lung transplant list and aware that new lungs will give additional 5 years to her life. Stella's best friend in hospital is another patient Poe (acted very well by Moses Arias) who is gay and afraid to take chances with his love life because of his CF . And then there is Will (excellent Cole Sprouse) another teenager with CF and in an experimental drug trial. Stella and Will like each other and know all there is to know about their lifespan. Screenplay is terrific. Everything about the movie is touching and actors did a great job. Having spent time in pediatrics unit as part of medical team, I am glad there are really patients like Stella who make the most of what is given.

52,LiveLoveLead,Another tearjerker about sick teens...,7,26 March 2019,"Haley Lu Richardson, as Stella, shines in this movie. She's beautiful and effervescent and is the saving grace to this pretty depressing movie. The film is about teens with cystic fibrosis who are stuck in the long term ward of the hospital. Because they could catch one another's bacteria they need to remain at least 6 feet away from each other. Brooding Will (Sprouse from Suite Life of Zack and Cody) and OCD, perky, Stella try to find a way to have some control over their lives which are full of regulated medicine, treatments, rules, and hospitalization that keeps them from friends, school and regular teen activities. The CF kids form tight bonds with each other and the caring hospital staff but generally live a very difficult and short life. Like I said... Depressing. Although somewhat predictable, and made more for the YA crowd, the film has its share of humor, tenderness, and heart-wrenching scenes that pull you into the emotional story.

The main characters in this romantic-drama are played by Cole Sprouse and Haley Lu Richardson.Both the main characters suffer from Cystic Fibrosis (CF) - a terminal illness that limits their lifespan. ""Five Feet Apart"" has been more authentic in showing the everyday problems and experiences that people suffering from CF have to deal with ; the therapies, vesting, the G tubes, the o2 , surgeries, the isolation, and so on. Of course, it is a movie, not a documentary - thus it is not one hundred per cent accurate. After all, movies are supposed to have at least some entertainment value.

When she has her lung transplant, he's there telling her as soon as she opens her eyes that he is doomed. Not the first thing you would think of telling someone that loves you when they first wake up from complicated and dangerous surgery.

That's a point off, and the fairytale setting of the frozen lake with the artificial snow around it was a bit stale. And another cliché had to be used, unfortunately. The best gay friend dies first.

Emotion display, to day's intellect class of patients covered in the story it self. Medico would definitely enjoy more. Films on Hospital Medical back ground are usually expectantly melodramatic.

Heck they even use ""Wait"" by M83 which was also used in Fault and on their Original Soundtrack. ""Five Feet Apart"" is not a carbon copy of Fault by any means. Cole Sprouse, Haley Lu Richardson and Moises Arias do an outstanding job acting in Five Feet portraying CF patients . The supporting cast especially Kimberly Hebert Gregory as nurse Barbara did a great job as well. It is a movie so accuracy may be off at times for the drama. It works well though. Highly recommended.

71,codygdietrich,Witty drama,9,16 August 2019,"Let me preface this by saying I hate romances, I find them to be tacky cliche and two dimensional. I'm not sure I'd classify this movie as a romance, it has a romance aspect but is also as much if not more a coming of age and finding one's identity in life story.I love the sarcastic insults between friends, it's refreshing. The fact that the supporting characters have depth and a bit of a back story vs living props like most romance films is great. The line of ""life's short it will be over before you know it"" can mean so many different things to different people. Regardless of how it may or may not end I know a lot of people that would tell me it's a depressing film, where as I found it refreshing and up lifting.I saw a thing that said ""life that awkward moment between birth and death"" and I feel this movie embodies that oh so well.",Five Feet Apart

I found it hard to get invested as the events unfolded in a very predictable and inorganic way. To its credit the ending was refreshing but it's a shame that the rest of the film couldn't be as subversive. I'm glad this film is bringing awareness to cystic fibrosis but it's a shame that the film itself feels like another YA film that will be forgotten in a few months time.",Five Feet Apart

The leads in the film do a good job especially Richardson and the film almost delivers but until the 3rd act of the film.
It becomes 'oh are they gonna do that' or 'I've seen it all before' type of scenario's, Very dramatic and quite the predictable ending but still the film isn't bad and really the message it tries to deliver us is that life is precious so please don't waste it.

Best acting from the amazing Haley Lu Richardson who played Stella and the amazing Cole Sprouse who played Will. Ten out of ten highly recommend it if you have a spare hour and fifty six minutes on your hands as you will laugh and cry a lot like I did.

84,MacArthur_Parker,"Just as sappy and predictable as any one of these ""sick teens"" movies can get",4,14 March 2019,"Based on the best-selling book by Rachael Lippincott with Mikki Daughtry and Tobias Iaconis, Five Feet Apart tells the story of Stella (Haley Lu Richardson) and Will (Cole Sprouse), two teenagers diagnosed with cystic fibrosis; in short, prone to difficult breathing and coughing up mucus due to lung infections, and aren't able to be within six feet of each other in danger of bacteria from one to infect another. They are treated at the Saint Grace hospital in an undisclosed location, and are monitored primarily by head nurse Barb (Kimberly Hebert Gregory). Stella is a vlogger who relies heavily on her ""clinical OCD"" to attend to the drug trial in which might extend her life. Will, however, has a devil may care attitude towards his sickness, often neglecting his regimen. They're practically opposites attract.The two major characters in their lives-or, much rather, Stella's life are her childhood best friend, fellow CF patient Poe (Moises Arias), and her older sister Abby (Sophia Bernard). Poe has accepted his illness but has trouble letting others in enough that they might help, which damages any romantic relationships. Abby lives a carefree, wild lifestyle, which she does in order to live life out for Stella as well.The film goes as expected. Will's morbid view of life clashes with Stella's optimism; she attempts to make him follow his schedule and only succeeds in that they're spending time together (for his benefit, he gets to draw her; not in that Titanic-y way but it's still weird); they sneak out at night to go on fun dates-Stella states about halfway through that the disease has claimed enough of their lives that they can take something back: using a pool cue, she dictates a new five-foot rule of separation.I can't really form a valid opinion without spoiling at least one thing, so read on at your own risk.It turns out that Abby died a year prior to the events of the film from a cliff diving accident. Like who could have not seen that coming? The amount of teen melodrama of the past few years only likens this ""twist"" to the Jeff Atkins plotline on 13 Reasons Why, except here, it doesn't take ten hours to get to that discovery. When Stella discovers that Will's eighteenth birthday is fast approaching, she rallies Poe and their two groups of friends into a surprise birthday party, sharing stories of the past and having a great time until they are discovered by Barb.I'll leave the rest to the viewer but this thing is just an attempt to cash cow off of ""The Fault in Our Stars"" (except that was actually GOOD) and Sprouse's success from ""Riverdale"". The cast is, without a doubt, insanely talented. Their chemistry works, just not for the movie they're in. Put Richardson and Sprouse in a romantic comedy, it's gonna be good. Similar to the cast of Twilight, they're a great ensemble caught in a sappy, laughable melodrama. 2/5.",Five Feet Apart
85,novacasa42,Haley Lu Richardson's MASTERCLASS.,9,12 October 2019,"I cried, I laughed, I smiled, This film had me go through all of that.Five Feet Apart is a very beautiful story that reminds us that life is precious and should be lived to the fullest, Stella & will's romance is charming and so seamless, it had this fantastic charm to it, mainly due to the two leads, especially Haley Lu Richardson who performed wonderfully throughout the film, now I know this might be filled with cliches and whatnot, but it felt genuine and heartfelt and that's right there is what matters at the end of the day.Chirs Nolan once said that films are meant to be felt not watched, this is exactly what I did with this one, absolutely breathtaking.",Five Feet Apart

Sometimes they keep distance sometimes they don't.Except for Barb nobody cares where the patients are going. They roam around all over the hospital, they organise a party and they even go out of the hospital. They play in snow, they take a dip in swimming pool.

94,dolive-578-564987,A terrific movie,9,27 September 2020,"If you give yourself into it, you'll enjoy this film. You'll have to be tolerant of a familiar death-and-dying trope and its attendant plot and dialogue cliches, and of a story that is as emotionally manipulative as the tour-de-force Terms of Endearment (1983), a classic tear-jerker. That said, Richardson's superb performance alone makes this movie a must-watch. Richardson is is convincing as a smart, responsible and caring person, who has to be that way or her affliction will defeat her. Her male love interest is not so convincing, but Richardson's thoroughly enjoyable persona puts that issue in the shadows. The movie is well-timed for the pandemic, with its theme of personal and collective responsibility. It also explains the basics of cystic fibrosis, and what patients strong of heart and mind (and good humor) do to survive all live-threatening health conditions. The movie runs a bit long. The place to cut is the falling-through-the-ice scene. The scene makes no sense given that Richardson's character is too smart to do such a thing. And coming late in the story, it overburdens an audience that has already endured a great deal of trauma. But the combination of Richardson, a good story, and the technical excellence of the movie makes Five Feet Apart among the best films in recent years. It's also a triumph of financially responsible filmmaking, with a budget of just $7 million, far below the average for mainstream releases that are so often forgettable. It's gratifying that Five Feet Apart has connected so well with audiences that it earned backed its production cost 13 times over within a year of its release.",Five Feet Apart

This movie had plenty of over the top moments, moments that would never happen in a hospital, but I think the writer/s and the director needed to stray from the substantive reality of cystic fibrosis, because for many patients CF can be quite difficult to manage and even insidious when they develop respiratory infections. Actually treating/meeting young people with CF and CF patients after receiving lung trasplants, I felt Five Hours Apart did a fine job portraying the bravery, the old soul wisdom, and the grit that young people with CF often have, and for me that's what made this movie a 10.",Five Feet Apart

There aren't really any risks taken and you're not going to get anything new, making the story very predictable at times. There are pacing issues as well, as the movie really begins to drag in the last act.The relationship between Stella and Will itself shows a lot of chemistry. However, I had a slightly difficult time buying it as realistic mainly because there was not a lot of build up and it felt very rushed.At the end of the day, the film is worth the watch despite the flaws primarily because of Haley Lu Richardson's absolutely charming performance. It doesn't take long at all for you to fall in love with her character. She is the emotional anchor of this story. The rest of the cast is also great in support.Characterization is what Five Feet Apart does best and should be commended for it.

110,SmashandNasty,The Fault in Our Stars Pt II,7,14 March 2019,"Stella (Haley Lu Richardson) is a teenager that spends most of her time in the hospital as a cystic fibrosis patient. Her life is full of routines and she has got everything figured out until she meets Will (Cole Sprouse), another teen with the same terminal and chronic illness. Flirtation quickly turns into broken rules with potentially deadly consequences.Our Take: If you're in the mood for a good cry in a dark theater, it's a good watch; but it will be just as good when it is on Netflix and can be watched in the comfort of your home with your favorite stuffed animal and a box of Kleenex.
Post-Credit Scene: Nope, you can run to the bathroom as soon as they start rolling.Let us guess: you loved The Fault in Our Stars. So are you in the mood for another sick kids movie? Well, this checks all the boxes. There are kids. The kids are sick. Plus, it tugs on all the appropriate heartstrings. But if you look beyond the trope, what is there?Here, there's actually a lot to unpack.This was the directorial debut for Justin Baldoni (of Jane the Virgin fame) and he did a decent job putting the movie together. The cast was the right mix of a popular teenage heartthrob, a kid you remember from some show you used to watch, and a talented girl next door. There's an appropriate amount of chemistry between Richardson and Sprouse. The soundtrack assembled every indie rock song that mentioned medicine or illness, but it was employed in a very tasteful manner. There were a few moments of questionable shakey cam footage that made watching difficult. There was a scene that was purposefully dragged out for the purpose of making the audience uncomfortable in a completely unnecessary way. The dialogue was a bit weak at times, but for characters that you knew had an impending expiration date, they were all fairly well developed. It wasn't perfect, but in the grand scheme of sick kid movies, it certainly ranks and in some ways, set itself apart.Unlike similar films of the past (A Walk to Remember, The Fault in Our Stars, and Everything Everything to name a few) this one wasn't based on a book (plot twist: there's a book based on it). It is also set primarily at the hospital and over a fairly short period of time, which tightened the narrative in a strange and at times off-putting way that other films have managed to escape. The film stayed fairly true to treatment mechanisms that are available to those with cystic fibrosis thanks to its consultant, the late Claire Wineland, though it fell into the same controversy its predecessors have by casting able-bodied individuals to play diseased and disabled characters. Some have called the film disease-appropriation, but as two people who don't have cystic fibrosis, this film did bring our attention to a disease we'd never heard of. It's not our place to say whether this newfound awareness is good, but we do hope that it has a positive impact by showing a snippet of what some people with CF deal with.",Five Feet Apart

It is actually funny I only read the book because my mother bought it for her, my sister, and my niece to read it so they could go see the movie. None of them read it though only I did. After finally watching the movie I was very pleased by it almost every scene and line were straight from the novel and each actor did a good job portraying their respective characters. The only things that were missing were narrative type things so I didn't have a big issue with them being left out. However, I would've liked to see more of Wills's friends Jason and Hope because they weren't very important in the movie but in the book essential to the chapters about Will the same can be said about his mother too her story is way more important in the book. But I get why they weren't essential to the movie since it focuses purely on Stella instead of the back and forth between Stella and Will in the novel. All in all, this was a good adaptation of the book and a sweet romance flick. I recommend it.",Five Feet Apart

The acting was spot on, but it was also refreshing to see Cole Sprouse take on a very different role to that of his ""tough guy"" character in Riverdale.

121,ansonlam,"Bittersweet at times, corny at times, romantic at times, cliche at times.",8,17 September 2019,"Boy oh boy did this movie give me mixed feelings. I've been a sucker for these romantic dramas ever since I watched The Fault in Our Stars. Despite having their similtarites at times, ultimately they part ways in story-telling and artistic style. Generally, it's a good movie. It made me cry at intended timestamps, but must I be absolutely frank, I could have held back those tears. I had high hopes for a supposed tear-jerker and it somewhat delivered, so why not go along with it.I can't deny that I ship Stellar and Will, but it did initially seem a bit cliche, circumferential and rushed. Very often these movies fall into the same pitfall of not being able to really, in a way, impressively prove that the lovers are the perfect couple, and I believe this movie has one foot in that pitfall right before the other punctually drags it out.Is it a tear-jerker? Well yes, but no. There are beautiful moments, as well as ones that really try to squeeze your eyes dry, but perhaps I have matured way too soon, it just didn't give that stab-in-the-gut feeling, only the this-is-pretty-sad-so-I-shed-some-tears-because-why-not?.Wow, I've slammed this movie harder than I'd envisioned. Don't get me wrong, it's a good movie, but t/here are undoubtedly expectations unfulfilled and gaps unfilled. Overall, an 8/10.",Five Feet Apart
122,jessfaith-45971,Simple yet Touching,8,17 March 2019,"5 Feet Apart is a very charming movie with an important message about the importance of being with the people you love. The movie has some very beautiful moments between Stella (Haley Lu Richardson) and Will (Cole Sprouse).The acting in this movie is amazing. While the first interaction between Will and Stella seems a little forced, the rest of the acting is on point. Stella's reaction when she learns of her friend Poe's death this truly heartbreaking to watch as he was her best friend. Everything from her initial reaction to her looking at a picture of him is outstanding. Haley's performance knocks it out of the park.Although this movie was amazing, I felt that the plot was a bit predictable. I reminded me of The Fault in Our Stars. Because of this, I already knew that the boy would die.Aside from that, 5 Feet Apart is still a genuinely good movie with that's very touching and simple. I would definitely check it out.",Five Feet Apart

I just watched it tonight and cried my eyes out. The two main characters played their parts beautifully. This is not a story with a happy ending, however, so be forewarned. It will break your heart. I follow ""The Frey Life"" on YouTube so I know a fair amount about Cystic Fibrosis, but it really did a good job on illustrating the dangers of how CF patients can spread germs to each other. I was not aware that there is a very dangerous, drug-resistant CF bacteria, so I learned that from this movie. All in all, I was thoroughly impressed by the acting.

126,Sam56800,Nicely done,7,15 March 2020,"I was put off by the trailer because it really made it look like a generic cheesy teen romance. But in the opening scene, the dialogue felt very natural and realistic. The actress has a very likeable quality about her - kind, compassionate, chill, and funny. She carried the film brilliantly. The chemistry she had with Sprouse was great. The film balances the romance and the depiction of CF well. The audience is given time to know the characters, their stories, and the implications of the disorder. What really held my attention was the naturalism and realism of the dialogue. The jokes, the quips, and the way the characters talked really felt real and normal, which is a rarity in teen romances. Often it comes on too strong, or scripted, or cheesy (ahem... fault in our stars), but this was great to listen to. If you liked the movie 50/50, you'll enjoy this one too.",Five Feet Apart

Sick teens, fights at first, falls in love, does things to comfort each other, one lead saves the other with some tears and a hopeful ending. There would be no over the top moments or mind bending twists. This movie follows a template like I mentioned but its not boring. Haley lu is expressive and you feel for her. She has a complex to be organized and wants to live and expects other to follow the same. Cole sprouse is rigid at first but towards the climax, he has a powerful scene to redeem himself. Climax I feel was a bit stretched , could have been crisp if it was short. A decent directorial debut from justin baldoni. All in all a decent movie. Delivers what it promises..

143,indyshafa,Too cliche. Script was poorly written.,3,30 March 2019,"The idea of shining light onto CF patients is really nice; it makes them feel known, and that's really good, you know? I'm glad they showed the specific medications CFers had to go through, their daily routines and whatnot. However so, if the scriptwriter had wanted this movie to have a little comedy-it completely failed. None of Will's sarcastic remarks were funny. The beginning, too, when they first met at the NICU didn't make sense. Sex, sex, sex. Then all of a sudden the next time they meet Stella says she has control issues and wants him to do his medications? Also not at how Stella claimed to be OCD yet the actress very poorly acted out that 'part' of the character. Didn't even look like a perfectionist. If you can't even pass to play as a perfectionist, how would you pass as an OCD? Did the actress and scriptwriters get mixed up between OCD and perfectionism? Come on, man. A little research won't hurt you. There were so many plot holes, and what agitated me the most was how unrealistic their love bloomed in a span of a month. Will's last words when they parted were extremely cliche, not touching. The fact that Will was originally introduced as a 'bad boy' kind of guy and suddenly he turns into a sotie because of Stella? Isn't the naive one who has never kissed or had sex Stella, not Will? The main leads' characters I felt were not developed well. If they wanted them to be dynamic characters at least put some more effort into the acting. This was extremely cliche. I didn't even shed a tear. Not one bit. The only thing that could differentiate this movie with other sick-and-in-love teenage romance movies would be the disease the both of them were suffering from, other than that, everything's just too easy to guess. There's no excitement. They meet, somehow fall in love without a clear development, lack of detail into the building of their relationship, and of course: the two leads not ending up together. The build up of their relationship to me was mediocre. I had no attachments towards whatever it is they had or shared. And how were they never caught until Will's birthday? It's not like the hospital has a lack of staffs? Too many coincidences, it's unrealistic.",Five Feet Apart

The difficulties faced by the characters and how they confided in one another and bonded over their struggles is an aspect that many can relate to in real life.

Will finds out his treatments aren't working, so when Stella wakes up from her lung transplant, he says goodbye in a glamorous, and tear- jerking way, and walks off into the night. they left an open ending, wanting an audience to decide what happens for themselves. a list of things could have happened; Will most likely died probably less than a year after he left the hospital, and Stella got 5 years added to her life after the transplant, but its never clear whether Stella will die early or old. the happy version is she could be able to have kids, since in the movie she loves babies, get married to someone she feels the same way she felt about Will, and maybe even still talk to Will occasionally, but that likely didn't happen because talking would lead to the temptation of seeing each other, which could spread bacteria. however you want to end it, i think it was a great movie and everyone should get to see this",Five Feet Apart

Anyone who does not cry watching this film is not even human. Empathy towards anyone who is ill is a human trait, too bad some guys do not have even that in today's world.

The acting was sublime.

196,bluesteele,Richardson and Sprouse Make This Work!,8,17 March 2019,"I feel compelled to write this review for all of those guys who get dragged along to see some cheezy romance flick by the wife or girlfriend and can barely make it through without trying to duck into the adjacent theater for something action oriented.That's how I ended up watching this, but honest-to-God . . . I have to give credit where credit is due. I'm usually so cynical about movies that seem so clearly intent on going straight for the heartstrings and forcing every girl in the audience to go for the emergency kleenex stash in the purse. I hate that feeling of being manipulated. ""Five Feet Apart"" actually works very well on all of the important levels. Cystic fibrosis is not a common disease, and I certainly wasn't familiar with it. But the script and the actors handle the condition with surprising sensitivity. Rather than making it the focus of an emotional trainwreck, no one seems to be working overtime to make you feel sorry for them. Rather, we get to see what seems to be a surprisingly appealing group of teenagers who've accepted the condition in various ways long before the opening scenes of the movie, and they are going to move forward with life without asking for our sympathy.There is a serious level of chemistry between Haley Lu Richardson and Cole Sprouse that has to be one of the most believable pairings I recall in this genre.
The growing sparks between them effectively places this truly debilitating genetic condition in just the right context. They don't want your sympathy--they just want a slim chance at happiness. Yes, the teenage girls in the audience were crying rivers at the end . . . but for once . . . I could completely understand it.",Five Feet Apart

212,sapphire_rain30,Cringy Teen Movie for Teen Audiences,5,20 April 2019,"This movie is okay, but it is no masterpiece. Sure, there were some 'nice' and 'cute' moments in this film, but it's not worth seeing in the cinemas. Save your money. I found this film to be predictable, poorly written and incredibly cliché. It lacks any kind of originality and creativity. There are SO MANY plot holes. It also lacks important character development. Due to the lack of character development throughout the entire film, I felt hardly anything when the major 'shocks' and 'climaxes' occurred in the film.In my opinion, I found that Will (Cole Sprouse) and Stella (Hayley Lu Richardson) did NOT have natural chemistry. It was clear that the casting directors only included Cole Sprouse in the film as the lead made to attract his worldwide teenage female fans to the film. There was no consideration as to whether Cole and Hayley actually had chemistry that could work successfully on the screen.As stated in the title of this review, this is most certainly a teenage movie aimed at a teen audience. If you are a mature adult with a taste for more complex or independent/artistic films, then you'll be disappointed by this one. This is just another typical teen film. It is a misrepresentation of the actual suffering involved in experiencing a terminal illness, such as cystic fibrosis.",Five Feet Apart

Who does not want more time on this beautiful plant? Who does not want to spend every single moment and take every single breath in the presence of a loved one? That being said, it is a movie that I would recommend to anybody looking for an entertaining love-story that takes your breath away and leaves you in tears.Anyway that being said, I do not want to actually spoil any of the content, since that might ruin the movie for a person (such as me) that prefers to discover the end by themselves, without having read it in advance.

218,venny-laturette,Awareness of CF through a flat love story,7,17 March 2019,"Five Feet Apart (FFA) is a film about a couple of teenagers Stella Grant( @haleyluhoo ) & Will Newman ( @colesprouse ) who are patients with Cystic Fibrosis who fall in love with each other although the disease only allows them to be near each other within 6 feet but then Stella changes it to 5 feet as the act of rebelious to the disease.The screenplay was written by #TobiasLaconis & #MikkiDaughtry then they sold it @justinbaldoni as producer and director. Also in November 2018, novel with the same name was published, the writer is Rachel Lippincott.The film has 3 big points, about love, hope & struggle, awareness of CF.For the love story, it is not new and quite similar with The Fault In Our Stars and flat. The characters meet, opposites attract (Stella is OCD and hopefull vs Will the random, artistic and pessimistic about his treatment), the hard relationship, the sweet gestures and so on.On the other hand the message about hope and fight for life is delivered strong through Stella, her hopeful behaviour for the treatment and lungs transplant and her fiery words everytime she needs to encourage Will, they resound nicely .The actors are not disappointing...but Will and Jughead are quite similar in terms of behaviour so no big changes for Cole's acting for those who watch Riverdale.",Five Feet Apart

222,CrumbsReviews,Amazing from Beginning to End,9,19 March 2019,"Let me start this off by saying I have never read the book for Five Feet Apart. I was intrigued by the trailers I've seen and had some high hopes for this film mainly due to my love for romantic movies. Even though this movie is classified as a romantic movie it does a great job informing the audience about Cystic Fibrosis. Going into this film I didn't really know much about Cystic Fibrosis but the movie does a pretty good job en lighting the audience about the illness. It provides information about the illness through a charming personality of Haley Lu Richardson's character Stella. This movie was great! It will make you laugh, cry and smile throughout the whole film. It has everything you want in a film. In my opinion this is Haley Lu Richardson's breakout film.While she was good in her supporting role in Edge of Seventeen, she was fantastic in this role and definitely showed her acting range. Cole Sprouse was also great in this film. Both their characters have great chemistry between one another and sold the romance aspect to the audience. Without spoiling anything this movie does have some really deep scenes that will get you emotional and have you tearing. This film hooked me right in from the opening scene with Haley Lu Richardson's charm and kept me engaged the whole time. I definitely recommend this movie to anyone who either want to see a romance movie or just wants to see a great movie in general.",Five Feet Apart

224,alexcmoore-23831,"Great acting, rushed story, questionable actions",6,15 March 2019,"The movie as it stands alone is cute. Both leads portray their characters well, and the movie can be related to The Fault in Our Stars in many respects. However, the movie was terribly rushed but was drawn out. The first hour of the movie had very little character development and instead of developing the characters and letting you make opinions on them, it stated facts and rushed into the characters. For example, when Poe died in the movie, I felt very little because he had not been developed at all.
My other complaint is how picky they are with what they can and cannot do. There were times throughout the movie where you said to yourself ""this is not a safe thing for someone with CF to do"" but they do it anyway. For example, they dedicated a scene of where Stella vigorously washed her hands and clothes after going in and touching things in Will's room, or when Will wouldn't blow out his candle for fear of contaminating the dessert, but five minutes earlier, Poe is seen cooking with his face in the food that everyone is going to eat.

Reminiscent of The Fault in Our Stars with quite the performance from Cole Sprouse and Haley Lu Richardson. And I dare say, I think it's way better than The Fault in Our Stars.

229,supratimpaul-11773,Great movie!! Surely a good masterpiece.. Close to the heart.. It makes us emotional.,9,23 August 2020,"""We need the touch from the one we love as much as we need to breathe"" , when Stella said these lines every person whose lover is far from them can feel it really hard. Two cystic fibrosis patient(Stella Grant and William Newman in short ""Will"") met each other at the same hospital and eventually fell in love. But destiny never allowed them to stay together. As CF patients have to keep distance of a six feet, they neither could touch nor come close towards each other. But love knows no bounds. They both knew that their life-span is too short but that love which blossomed in their hearts gave them a hope to live, a hope to enjoy their short life together. Stella and Will kept meeting, made magical moments keeping five feet apart. They loved each other for their true real selves. The bond between Stella and her friend Poe who was also a CF patient was also shown beautifully. The end, though, was very painful and heartbreaking as it was realistic. The way Will saved Stella's life and let her go to start her a new Cf-free life shows that his love was selfless. He knew that it is harmful for both if they stayed together and real love neither harms nor hurts. The movie ""Five feet apart"" shows that love is unconditional and irrevocable. Sometimes life is hard, you break, your whole existence gets shattered, you can't take the pain anymore. But you still want to see each other happy though you are not destined to live together with the person you love. In the very end Stella gives a heartwarming message to all that as long as you have the chance to touch the persons you love, touch them, hug them, kiss them. ""Life is short to waste a second""- she was absolutely right.",Five Feet Apart

243,nirvanwali,Unexpected and Superb Acting!,8,26 May 2019,"Okay this was unexpected. I never thought this movie will be so good. I expected something like ""Forever be my Girl"" or ""Juliet Naked"" but I didn't see this coming. I didn't like the movie till first 30 thirty, but then boom!
Direction was good, acting was amazing and story was kind of predictable but beautiful. I haven't seen Cole Sprouse or Haley Lu Richardson before and I'really impressed. Both did justice to their roles and the movie. The chemistry between the whole team was amazing. An amazing idea executed amazingly.
Now there are people who always say that these movies are so unreal and like fairy tales. There's nothing real or natural in them. Well you can't make a love story or romantic movie and make it real. They will watch Marvel and DC with great excitement but will call movies like this unreal.",Five Feet Apart

So basically the movie is based on a terminal disease ""Cystic fibrosis"" which results in filling of your lungs with mucus.
So the movie starts with a girl which is really uptight, actually uptight is an understatement.She has a great heart and everything typically the good girl type. And obviously she has the disease.And the chick-flick movie that it is she meets a boy with the same diagnostics . They fell in love and so on , everyone knows where its gonna go ,so no surprises.
If you are looking for something refreshing don't bother watching this .
Not saying that it is a bad movie but there are much movie better in this genre noting new.
So good luck",Five Feet Apart

250,vikanabila,Showing true love,9,15 May 2019,"Have you ever watched a movie and you are really obsessed with it? As a big fan of romance movie, of course I have and here I want to give you some reviews about a movie that I've watched last March with my friends. It is Five Feet Apart. The movie is directed by Jonas Baldoni. FIVE FEET APART is a movie adapted from novel which tells about teens who fall in love under life-and-death circumstances. They are Stella (Haley Lu Richardson), a kind and rule-following 17-year-old cystic fibrosis (CF) patient who's back in the hospital for a ""tune up"", and Will (Cole Sprouse), rule-breaking 17-year-old who also has CF and is in the hospital.
They are supposed to stay away at least six feet apart from one another to avoid contagious infections that could worsen their condition. The two begin closer and flirt each other that leads to romance story. Stella helps Will be more disciplined and not to be ignorant with his treatments, and he helps her learn to seize and enjoy the day of her life.
Five feet apart such a great film, because its teach us how beautiful true love is. No matter what your condition, love always find its way.
For me, it is a good movie. It is such a heart-warming movie you could ever watch. Even though most of the action takes place inside a hospital, don't imagine that it'll be so boring. We can feel and imagine how people live their life there. We can see how does it feel to see people finally can survive of their own sickness or not. I love how this movie has a realist approach to such a tender subject. As well as placing the characters at a human like view. The story is easy to follow and you can always guess what will happen next. Still, it's a cute and lovely movie.",Five Feet Apart

258,ohunivers,a rebirth of a beautiful piece,8,18 April 2020,"The thing about movie adaptation is that it always somehow leaves something out, fails to transfer certain feelings which is understandable because words are just endless, whereas a scene is. but the thing about this movie is that the actors delivered, way more than the characters themselves which was amazingly fulfilling for someone who felt that the book and the basic plot was flawy from the very start. it basically went from a cliche to a heart wrenching story, just the way it was supposed to be. one of the best movie adaptations out there, the cast made it happen.",Five Feet Apart

Under the pretense that one's family is going to watch the movie for support, I never understood how one could get involved in a big kiss or an uncensored sex scene.

I'm not saying this is a bad movie but it's not as good as I expected at all!",Five Feet Apart
266,brittneybff,Best emotional film ever!!,10,15 May 2021,"Wow, where do I even begin with this amazing film. It is truly.extraordinary I mean really focuses on the proper health of.cystic fibrosis knowing people who are truly dealing with that in this world isn't the luckiest since anyone else in the hospital with the same condtion makes even harder to not touch the ones that you love. Stella and Will's story is just breath taking I mean I was quite surprised to see how it had some.similarities of the book I mean a few months ago now I read Five Feet Apart and I felt the exact same emotion I did when I watched the film in cinemas it was truly powerful and how so much depth wthin in their storyline. Will and Stella honestly truly deserve a happy ending and to know how in the months apart and the.alternate ending of the movie how they saw each other again you could.physically tell how much they just simply wanted to jump into each other's arms and touch one other and share that sweet bitter kiss but they couldn't because.with having a lung transplant because of the.cystic fibrosis you never know when it'll come back into those fresh lungs so that's why instead of them running into each other's arms tbey just stared at each other knowing that they both were okay but I truly want to know what happened next. Did Will die after a few months after seeing her? How's Stella's life? There's just so many burning questions I have! This entire film was just filled with some many great and memorable scenes that will have you in so many tears that you literally couldn't hold back for.This film just showcases how much yourself and your loved one cherish their lives more than anything because most of us can't cherish our lives like others because endless nights and dasys in hospital wishing we could go home but we do treatment and try our best to look after our health so it isn't for those who struggle every single day so this movie and the book was such a powerful way of spreading the message to everyone and those with cystic fibrosis that life isn't easy but we do try every day to make sure we live this world as much as we can because some days we are just simply not as lucky as those dealing with those serious health issues!",Five Feet Apart
267,AmrishaSaha,"""I will fight for you. I always do, until my heart is black and blue""",10,20 June 2021,"What a movie! ""Five Feet Apart"" is more than just a love story between Stella and Will. It's a story about love, life, compassion, taking chances, and taking risks. The cast of this film is amazing. Haley Lu Richardson and Cole Sprouse have done an excellent job.

271,dancerdion,Just like the book,10,17 March 2019,If you have read the book then you will be happy when you go see the movie. I knew from the beginning that the movie was going to be an emotional rollercoaster if they did the book justice and they did. I've never seen a movie where it portrayed the book accurately. The casting for this movie was spot on and everyone's performance was top notch. If you are a hopeless romantic then this is a movie for you. Be prepared to cry.

This movie is fantastic and is my favorites that I have seen this year. The characters are relatable and lovable, the music is perfect. The humor is natural feeling and adds the the overall atmosphere of the movie. The acting is freaking perfect and unlike anything I have seen Cole sprouse do. 20/10 would recommend",Five Feet Apart
275,emilymarshmallows,I have CF - here's my opinion,8,19 March 2019,"I'm a 35 year old with CF. I was excited about this movie because any representation is potentially great. But I've seen other CF movies, seen it on TV, and it's usually terribly done. Incorrect nonsense, people are on o2 but climbing hills like it's no big deal, the severity isn't properly shown, etc.This movie manages to mostly stay away from that. Is it 100% accurate? Of course not. It's still a Hollywood film. It's not a documentary. That being said, this does a better job than any other CF fiction I've ever seen. It includes a lot of the real things that CFers deal with: all our therapies, nebs, vesting, the ports, the G tubes, the o2, surgeries, the isolation, the survivor's guilt, and many others.A lot of people in the CF community have been up in arms about two CFers getting together despite the bacteria concerns. While I understand the hesitation, I personally know four couples where both spouses had/have CF (had because some have died). We need to look at this as a real situation because it is. There's a lot of isolation in CF, and reaching out to the only people on the planet who can truly understand you is only natural. As long as both people are consenting adults, know the risks, and go for it anyway, we need to respect that.I appreciate that this movie tackles both the reality of CF and the controversial subject of CFers breaking the six foot rule. This is a very real film, and not once did I feel offended or roll my eyes. Not 100% accurate, no, but I feel seen. I feel represented. Absolutely worth seeing, and i look forward to seeing it again.",Five Feet Apart
276,CrisBSola,One of my favorite films,10,19 April 2020,"The film (based on a book) tells us about Stella, Will y Poe.
They're teenagers with cystic fibrosis, a lung disease with no cure and with which you can consider yourself extremely lucky if you get a transplant to try to live 5 more years. One of the risks of this disease is getting closer to other patient with the disease, so any type of contact is prohibited.Super hard, super beautiful. It broke my heart.",Five Feet Apart

279,reusjy,Could Be Better,7,2 September 2019,"I respect this movie.Going into this movie I pretty much knew what to expect. Two CF patients kindling a fordbidden love. The first act I enjoyed greatly. The movie sets up the characters with interesting backstories and how they interact with each other (except Will his backstory was a bit lackluster). But there is a point where I felt like the Will and Stella's relationship did a 180 without justification.Second act was a bit drawn out. Imo the second act was a bit too long, many scenes could be cut without affecting the impact of the third act, in fact it would enhance the impact of the third. Aside from being
a bit stale, it is also marred with expected clichés, there was so much potential for the movie to go somewhere special but it didn't take it. There's just not much substance.Third act was the best. Sure it may have been a bit dramatic and the characters may make some questionable decisions, they're teenagers after all I can't fault them too much. Not sure if the message at the end was a correct one but my god was Richardson amazing. I've only really seen her in The Edge of 17 but in this she proved that her acting was incredible. She bumps the emotional factor of this movie up by one.I really hoped the movie could be better, like life changing better, it had the potential. But it settled for a standard tear jerk romance flick and I guess that's that. Pretty enjoyable and worth a watch.",Five Feet Apart

295,alexandrafischer,"amazing, heartbreaking, beautiful",10,19 March 2019,This was probably the most amazing movie that I've watched in a while. Definitely a 10 out of 10. The movie shines a light on how hard life can be and presents a romance with a non-sexual atmosphere which is something 9 out of 10 movies lack now days. Most romances are anticipated with a sex scene and to not put one in makes this movie perfect. This is also a very heartbreaking movie and heartwarming in the same sense. Some of the scenes in this movie make you want to cry your eyes out and other scenes in the movie make you want to turn to your side and hug the person you came with. Two days later and I'm still crying inside because of the ending. It makes people open their eyes to what the world could be for them and to how easy some people have it. I honestly don't have a single issue with the movie. I am definitely going to refer this movie to everyone I know. Thank you for shining a light on things others are scared to.

BUT THE BLOODY ENDING OF THE MOVIE IS INCORRECT AND UNSATISFYING!!!
In the book's end, Stella lungs work perfectly and Will goes to another hospital for another treatment. Stella travels the world. At the airport she comes out of departures and Will is standing there, smiling. He's cured. They run to each other and step closer- 4 metres apart- and touch hands. That is a happy ending. I wanted that ending in the film so bad.
But the directors wouldn't let us have it. I know its kinda unrealistic but I wanted it so bad. I would of made me happy. I'm sad now. Let me brood in my sadness.",Five Feet Apart

317,kenziedunlap,Love from Five Feet Apart,9,22 January 2020,"Five Feet Apart is the best tear jerker I've seen in awhile. Similar to Fault in Our Stars, Five Feet Apart is a sick teen love story. With a storyline based on the real life couple Dalton and Katie Prager, the film captures real raw emotions. Justin Baldoni, the director, uses familiar ideas we often see within the plot to reel in the audience.Stella Grant (Haley Lu Eichardson) and Will Newman (Cole Sprouse) are both patients battling Cystic Fibrosis, a genetic disorder that affects lung function and has a high risk of cross infection within other patients with Cystic Fibrosis. That being said, the majority of the movie is shot in a hospital, nicer than any I've ever seen... it has a swimming pool! Cystic Fibrosis patients are ordered to remain six feet apart from one another at all times. Will also contains a bacteria that puts other Cystic Fibrosis patients even more at risk.With feuding personalities, it was only destiny that Will and Stella would fall in love and fulfill the idea that opposites attract. Stella's type A controlling personality and Will's ""live-on-the-edge"", ""we're-dying-anyways"" personality are just naturally drawn to each other. The director explores this relationship in detail, drawing out the best from both actors as they offer a believable performance. As the two begin falling for each other, Stella coaches him though the treatment plan he has been choosing to ignore. The video chat calls weren't cutting it and they started hanging out face to face. The six feet rule began to be unbearable so the couple daringly decides to lower the distance to five (hence the title Five Feet Apart). This leads the audience to wonder how far they will go. Will they forget all rules? Will they kiss? Hold hands? Justin does a good job of engaging the audience here. Many red flags arise to the nurses. That is the least of Will and Stella's worries, at this point they are willing to risk things if it means they can be together. The couple spends most of their time together in hideout, trying not to be found by nurses because that ends in separation and a long talk.During their last adventure together an unexpected event leds to an expected end result. It was called for and falls into the path of the genre. Even though it was called for I was so emotionally invested that when Stella fell through the ice my heart stopped along with hers. The sad soulful music only adds to the emotions and the conversations shared among Will and Stella really grab the viewers. The script is so realistic I felt as if I was there listening live. The video chats between Stella and Will serve as a good break up in filming style and editing rather than the constant panning. Themes of death and love are displayed. Death becomes a reoccurrence. Poe, Stella's sister, it was beginning to happen so fast it makes us wonder who is next? Will it be Stella? Will it be Will? Stella and Will are possibly the best example of showing first hand that love is not easy and that it takes sacrifice. Stella ends the movie by speaking on the importance of touch, an ending that will leave you in tears for sure. Five Feet Apart is a must watch for Romance movies.",Five Feet Apart

331,f-01384-31235,"Review to ""Five Feet Apart""",9,10 December 2020,"The last film I went to see at the cinema was ""Five Feet Apart"" directed by Justin Baldoni (2019). Actually, I didn't expect that much from this film considering it as a yearly far-fetched teen romance film with a predictable ending, but yet it took me out of emotional balance. By the way, my friends also liked this film.
This gripping story is about two teens with life-threatening incurable lung diseases like cystic fibrosis falling in love with each other. So, cystic fibrosis patients are supposed to stay at least six feet apart from one another to avoid contagious infections that could worsen their already precarious condition. It all starts with a timid friendship and a flirtation that eventually leads to romance, which is predictable.
I can't say that the main cast (Sprouse and Richardson) should be nominated for an Oscar, but I think they did their job pretty well, they showed sincere love, without pathos, breaking clichés of a young adult tragic novel in places. Especially in this regard, I liked Hailey's character , at least for not playing a dying swan, instead being an optimistic and sensual girl, which in the end is explained by her mania ""not to die"".
To sum up, this film is more about fighting which is sufficiently thought-provoking, not a love at all. Fear of death, pain of loss, but at the same time hope, love, joy -a whole storm of emotions. Isn't this the main goal of art - to awaken feelings?",Five Feet Apart
332,tony-1333,Overwrought final act,6,10 September 2019,"The first two acts were realistic and emotional. Then the film veered into camp and melodrama. Still worth a watch, but be prepared to be let down.",Five Feet Apart

339,abidon-06108,"Mucoviscidosis, a daily fight",10,22 May 2021,"The perfect mix of a touching and believable story. The film touches its audience with its subject matter of cystic fibrosis. Will and Stella are two teenagers with this disease and cannot get within five feet of each other without risking contracting the other's bacteria. Thus, a friendship is formed between Stella, an optimist who believes in the drug treatment they are taking, and Will who has no confidence in it. Friendship that will eventually turn into love. The film is very well played between tender and hard moments but also deals with a subject that is still little known to all. We spent the whole evening crying in front of this film, my friends and I, which proves that it touches the deepest part of us. It's a masterpiece that should be ranked at the top as it is well made and realistic of a world where these patients have little visibility. ""We need that touch from the one we love almost as much as we need to breathe. But I never understood the importance of touch, his touch... until I couldn't have it. So if you're watching this and you're able, touch him, touch her. Life's too short to waste a second"".",Five Feet Apart
340,deepkonar-29498,my take on this movie,8,27 June 2021,"Five feet apartLove Stories always have to have a reason to keep the couple apart and this was not an exception infact in this case they are really apart. So for us breathing isn't a luxury but for people with lung diseases like cystic fibrosis (CF) every breath is precious and the struggle is real. You never know when it's gonna be your last breath. In the movie five feet apart the teenagers with CF understood their disease and limitations. With time hospital has been a second home to Stella and the medical staffs have become are family. Even though she had such serious illness ,it didn't hold her back from enjoying simple joys of life. Her bestfriend Poe is back in hospital too and so is Will who's another CF patient. While Stella cooperates well in her treatment hoping to be able to get lung transplant, Will is faultfinder and a rebel who's pessimistic. With time both of them become more than friends and were madly in love with eachother. But it wasn't until they had to face consequences and they were unaware of the risks. It's so tempting that director Justin Baldoni balances compelling specifics of CF with the serious question that everyone face about creating meaning in a world of uncertainty and loss. And he does it with two talented young stars, especially Richardson, whose graceful expressive face shows us hope, repentance, agitation and yearning Stella's perception. Baldoni shows the sensitivity and insight in exploring the issues within a fictional story. Even healthy people can die. Illness can devastate people's lives financially and emotionally. It is frightening to love someone but it is even scarier to let someone love you, especially when you are insecure. In reality films like this remind us that we could all do better at making sure we get the most from the time we have and loving a little too much. This movie was a masterpiece.I would rate it 3.5/5 because it was touching, romantic, emotional, and tearjerker, the characters also left some memorable remarks and it's a must watch. This movie proved that love someone unconditionally, there aren't any limitations. I would recommend it for anyone who's looking for a beautiful and heart wrenching story. The film could have given the CF couple a fair chance but it had sad ending and it seemed more realistic. It portrays the simple things in our lives which we often overlook.Initial release- 15 March 2019, IndonesiaDirector- Justin Baldoni

By the end of the movie I was suprised by how far fetched it became. I thought the two main characters had known each other for atleast a total of one year. But no, this movie unfolded over the course of 1 month.
Correct me if I am wrong, but having cystic fibrosis does not speed up the perception of time to make 1 month feel as though it has been a lifetime.

I love the fact that this movie it's not the common clichè, which I also why I want to became an actress so bad in the future, as I would love for people to watch my movies, and to get the message and the emotions I'm trying to spread in them. Anyways, a recap of everything? TOTALLY recommend it! The best movie I've watched so far! I wish there could be a sequel because I'm really curious on how the story would keep going..would they ever meet again? Will Stella be able to survive with the new lungs for more than 5 years? I cried so much because, even though I don't have the disease, I still felt the character's pain, which is something that happens really rarely for me while I watch a movie..as I mentioned above..the BEST movie I've watched so far! Go and watch it!",Five Feet Apart

372,agotavidrinskaite,i never cry at movies,10,27 May 2019,"Touching. this movie touched my feelings so hard that i cant even explain any of it. i never cry at movies, maybe couple of tears try to get out but never do. this one was like all stress situations from my life has been put to a two hour movie and i loved it. highly recommend cause it changes something but i cant explain what it just does.",Five Feet Apart

374,graceberlin,Sweet but typical romantic teen-movie,8,15 April 2019,"When I watched the trailer to this film I was sceptical, 'cause I kinda felt like it's gonna be a second ""The Fault in our Stars"" with different actors and another disease. But I was quit suprised how much more I actually liked this then TFIOS. Sure it's still a typical romantic teen-movie, but I liked it for that. You get what you expect in a delightful and real way. And a plus point for me is also the representation of CF. Before this movie I didn't even know that a disease like that exist and know I want to research and learn more about it. I had a lot of fun watching this movie would recommend it !",Five Feet Apart

377,carenwils,A definite tearjerker,8,7 August 2019,"Up until seeing this movie I only knew Justin Baldoni as 'the guy from Jane The Virgin'. Man, my respect for him has grown a tonne since seeing Five Feet Apart. I expected this to be another sappy and predictable teen romance movie, with yet again another storyline of people who are ill and can't do much about it. However, I was pleasantly surprised. In my opinion the acting was incredible, it felt real, down to Cole and Haley's giggles and shrugs. This makes the situation of the two hit even more. I can say I cried a few times, sometimes when something sweet happened and sometimes when someone was in danger.
Every now and then the writing was a little cliché and Poe's death felt kind of rushed to me. But maybe that's because everything moves so fast when you're looking death right in the eye. I'm glad I'm not in the characters shoes. Seeing the reviews of how this movie represents real people with CF and how it does a good job though, makes me glad the movie's out here for everyone to see. And spoilers: it's beautiful.",Five Feet Apart
378,gemmaneeleman,Haven't cried this much with any other movie,10,21 June 2019,"This movie has such a great acting work, that I was crying non stop (I even had a headache for the rest of the day) honestly I can't recall any movie where I cried this much. You really start to understand how hard it is to be either one of the main characters...",Five Feet Apart

380,thedennyteam,Hollywood takes a subject matter risk & it should pay in Oscars,10,3 July 2019,"'Five Feet Apart' I am standing in my living room applauding Hollywood and the 'powers who be' that greenlighted this project! If this movie, its two main actors, the script, the producers and director aren't nominated for Oscars THIS YEAR, then the Academy has a screw loose. Finally, somebody found an original topic, developed an interesting script - touching, informative and accurate (maybe a few dramatic liberties), mezmerizing performances from EVERYONE involved, perfect editting and scoring - simply fabulous! I was glued to the screen, tears rolling down my face, laughing, learning about a topic and members of my human community of which I previously knew nothing about and cheering at the simple, yet profound wisdom contained within some of the lines of this script. First Time Director, Justin Baldoni nailed it! His attention to details literally blows this one out of the park - absolutely no scene was overdone, no part over played, no point over made - and, while he shot an alternative ending, made the right choice sticking with the one he did. If this is what Justin's first attempt at directing looks like - I can't wait to see what else he does! And, just in case I've left anyone in doubt, I thoroughly enjoyed this film and HIGHLY recommend watching it!",Five Feet Apart
381,margomary-27106,This is the Love Story movie for millennials !,10,19 March 2019,"This is such a romantic, sad , but very uplifting movie. As a breast cancer survivor I can honestly say that Cole Sprouse & Haley Lu Richardson give believable performances as Cystic Fibrosis patients . Go see it & be inspired about the will to live each day to the fullest!",Five Feet Apart
