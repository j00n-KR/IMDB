0,TheLittleSongbird,One of Brian De Palma's best films,10,13 February 2011,"I was thoroughly impressed with Carlito's Way. So far it is my favourite Brian De Palma film alongside Carrie and The Untouchables. De Palma's direction itself is terrific, while some of the set pieces such as the pool fight, the 15-minute subway chase and the shenanigans on the train-station escalator are among the best in any De Palma film.The cinematography is excellent, the lighting is used in an interesting way and the scenery and locations are striking. In short, the film looks good. The soundtrack drives the film very well too, the script is smart and funny and the story is ceaselessly compelling. The pace is spot on, and the acting is very good. Al Pacino gives a suitably restrained performance which was a refreshing change from his excessive performance in Scarface, while the supporting cast have plenty of time to enjoy themselves.In conclusion, a fine film. 10/10 Bethany Cox",Carlito's Way
1,bkoganbing,They pull Al Pacino back in again in this film as well,8,8 March 2015,"The tragedy of Al Pacino's character Carlo Brigante is that after his shortened stretch in the joint he realizes there is a life out there beyond his gangster world and the mean streets of East Harlem. But Pacino only finds that out way too late. And like that other iconic Pacino character Michael Corleone he gets sucked right back in. In retrospect Pacino should have had a ticket for Florida waiting for him the New York minute he got out of prison.This would be a film totally dominated by Al Pacino had it not also been for the incredible performance of Sean Penn. If in fact Penn took the role only for the bread he certainly gave the movie-going public its money's worth when they paid to see Carlito's Way. I'm surprised that he was not given Oscar consideration.When a lot of money comes to Pacino and I won't reveal how, he buys into a nightclub with the intention of earning just enough money to set himself up in business in Florida. But in his way Pacino is a man of honor. He does owe his lawyer Penn big time. Penn in fact found a loop hole as good lawyers do and got Pacino sprung from a long rap. So when Penn asks for a favor, Pacino has to oblige.Penn is fascinated by the life the criminals he defends lead. The easy access to money and power and women have turned him into a pleasure maddened hedonist. Some other criminals he's been the attorney for Penn has not behaved honorably to put it mildly. He asks Pacino to help him cover up that fact though Pacino does not realize it at first. It's part of the undoing of both of them. The other part is the dismissive way he treats an up and coming gangster John Leguizamo. Think of Gregory Peck and how he treats Skip Homeier. in The Gunfighter.Penelope Ann Miller is a young dancer who is fascinated by Carlo Brigante and is drawn to him. For the audience she embodies us and our fascination. For Pacino she represents the good life he aspires to.In character development Carlo Brigante most resembles another of Pacino's iconic parts, that of Tony Montana. But classic film fans will recognize a strong resemblance to one of Humphrey Bogart's gangster roles in The Big Shot. If it were not for what Sean Penn gives us in Carlito's Way this would be strictly a personal Pacino work. Their scenes together in Carlito's Way are unforgettable.",Carlito's Way
2,Leofwine_draca,A second gangster classic from De Palma,10,23 December 2015,"Brian de Palma scores once again with another gangster epic. Despite having a number of flaws, CARLITO'S WAY is still a very good film, chronicling as it does so the life of Al Pacino's gangster as he is released from prison and determined to go straight. But we've all heard that before... Okay, so this film is behind SCARFACE, which was one of the best gangster films ever, but for the '90s it's very good and stands up on its own amongst all the junk filling the shelves these days. De Palma adds in all his trademark homages to Hitchcock (especially in the last twenty minutes) and stylistic touches which make this film interesting and sometimes exciting to watch.Where it falls apart somewhat is in the dialogue scenes, especially in the added romance between Pacino and Penelope Ann Miller. The film's running time does feel excessive (2 hours 19 minutes) and a lot of these scenes are dragged out. Miller is miscast as Pacino's love interest, because she just isn't a very convincing actress. Thankfully these stodgy moments only account for a quarter of the film. For the rest of the time we're back in familiar territory. The cast is populated by seedy villains (John Leguizamo is a standout as a creep), and it's Sean Penn who really excels in an unrecognisable role as Pacino's crooked lawyer, a cokehead to boot. Penn is very good here, a real character you love to hate.Obviously, though, it's Pacino who stands head and shoulders above the rest of the cast, and he doesn't disappoint either. He portrays a character who is out of touch with the modern world, a romantic who is sometimes crooked, sometimes violent, but infinitely likable. The violent content to the film has been toned down a lot since SCARFACE, but there are still a couple of bloody moments to behold from de Palma's gory, glory days including a wince-inducing shot to the face. Where this film really excels is in the final twenty minutes, a lengthy chase scene. This sequence is taught, tense and totally thrilling, and easily the best part of the entire film.Okay, so there are numerous flaws; the voice-over seems unnecessary and intrusive, as if De Palma had watched GOODFELLAS one too many times, the whodunit aspect of the ending is easily guessable, and the running time is far too long and needs judicious trimming. But despite these factors, CARLITO'S WAY is still a cut above the rest, and prime viewing for gangster fans.",Carlito's Way
3,SnoopyStyle,Good solid gangster movie,7,8 October 2014,"It's 1975 NYC. Puerto Rican Carlito Brigante (Al Pacino) is released after 5 years in prison when the evidence against him is thrown out. He claims to be reborn and dreams of buying into a car rental business for $75k in the Bahamas. Dave Kleinfeld (Sean Penn) is his lawyer. Dave wants to buy a club and have Carlito run it. His cousin Guajiro drags him to a drug deal but it all goes wrong. Guajiro is killed and Carlito escapes with the money which he uses to buy into the club. He is still in love with his ex Gail (Penelope Ann Miller). Benny Blanco (John Leguizamo) is a young gangster who feels slighted by Carlito. Meanwhile Dave is in trouble after stealing his client's $1 million payoff money.Director Brian De Palma reunites with Al Pacino in a gangster story. The problem is that it feels very familiar but it doesn't really measure up to past glory. It also seems like De Palma is retreating after a couple of missteps. On its own, this is a good solid gangster movie but it's not the best of the genre.",Carlito's Way
4,mark.waltz,The diary of an ugly life.,6,16 March 2017,"There's no rising above your station in life or destiny when you've been trained since adolescence. Pacino goes from Cuban mobster in Florida to Puerto Rican drug lord in the barrio. Not much has changed in my neighborhood as far as locations are concerned with the Metro North running above Park Avenue. The only difference is the clean-up it has undergone with police presence. But once upon a time, there was little safety walking down the streets of East Harlem, and this documents those ugly violent times where gang members didn't break into sing and dance a la ""West Side Story"".Practically every well known tough looking Hispanic actor makes an appearance in this, including several comics who show off their dramatic chops. While John Leguizamo went onto great fame in comedy standup, Rick Aviles (in a bit role as a brutal thug who gets a violent demise) is best known for the murdered in ""Ghost"", yet had a promising career in comedy before his early death. Among the other Hispanic actors, Luis Guzman stands out as Pacino's best friend who stands by him until a shocking end. Individual moments with these characters make you want them to escape, just as other moments want to make you see them fry.So while the cast is uniformally great (including a much disguised Sean Penn as an equally messed up defense attorney), the lives their characters lead are not so respectable. Through Pacino's voice over's, you get to hear his inner voice longing for a way out, but like Moses being lead to the burning bush, it's his destiny. He loves a beautiful white dancer (Penelope Ann Miller), but escaping his life is out of the question thanks to his past always sneaking up behind him. There are enemies who openly hate him (Leguizamo), those he trusts who betray him (Penn and Guzman) and the woman who loves him (Miller) and openly fears seeing him dying slowly in the middle of the night. While the film runs a lengthy 2 1/2 hours, the horrors of the every day fears will keep you mesmerized. Throats are slit, heads are bashed in, and flying bullets strike their victims in the most shocking of places. Many of the characters are pretty much perverts or beyond reproach, although there's a subtle hint of the gentleman in the often philosophical Carlito, as far away from ""Scarface's"" Tony Montana that Pacino and director Brian DePalma could make him. But it's obvious that this is a life where there are no winners. Like Faye Dunaway reveals as Bonnie Parker sadly, the only way out is death.",Carlito's Way
5,kosmasp,Say Hello to my Lawyers friend,8,3 August 2019,"The documentary on the disc was quite interesting. While not revealing everything (the names certain characters are based on, mostly a mix of string of people anyway, for example) I personally didn't know this was based on the second book that was written about Carlito. So the sequel, which actually was a prequel many years later was the one that is actually based on the novel called ""Carlitos Way"".Trivia aside, you have a Pacino who never does wrong, even if as De Palma predicted wouldn't help the movie much. Though many political reasons played into that. And while it did not get the immediate recognition back when it was released, it has quite the after life. And after life is a good point on the main character. What to do after life in prison? Going straight is easier said than done. Especially if you still are being influenced by many bad sources and hang out with the wrong people. Also Karma ... can you swing your luck and destiny overall?",Carlito's Way
6,gavin6942,Sean Penn's Best Role,8,18 May 2011,"There really is not much to say about this film -- Al Pacino stars with Brian De Palma directing. Separately, they both have made plenty of great films. Together, they made ""Scarface"". While this film may not be as iconic as ""Scarface"", it is every bit as good -- and features a character you can feel real sympathy for, as he is more than just a criminal.But I think what sets this film apart from others like it is Sean Penn. Oh man, this is easily his best role. I did not even recognize him until almost halfway through the film, despite staring right at the man. The voice, the mannerisms -- brilliant. And that hair, oh my. I cannot say I have ever been a huge Penn fan, but this is his crowning achievement and nobody could claim otherwise.",Carlito's Way
7,lee_eisenberg,"Even if Al Pacino gets typecast in crime-related roles, then movies like this justify it",7,8 May 2005,"Al Pacino plays Carlito Brigante, an ex-con who gets released from jail in 1970's New York City. He hopes to live an honest life, but his past unfortunately won't allow it. When he resists, things then get very ugly for everyone (to say the least).Pacino and Sean Penn (as his cocaine-addicted lawyer) are in their usual top-notch form, and Penelope Ann Miller adds an interesting spin as Carlito's legitimately living girlfriend trying to help him lead a straight life. While ""Carlito's Way"" may contain many of the things that one anticipates in a movie about criminal life, it always fulfills our expectations of what an A-list movie should be. Definitely one of Brian DePalma's best.",Carlito's Way
8,jboothmillard,Carlito's Way,7,14 November 2006,"From director Brian De Palma (Carrie, The Untouchables), I was looking forward to seeing the star of Scarface and its director reuniting ten years later. Basically Carlito 'Charlie' Brigante (Al Pacino) Puerto Rican ex-criminal who has served five years in prison, and he has vowed not to go back to his old ways, living as a regular citizen. He begins by rekindling his relationship with ex-lover Gail (Golden Globe nominated Penelope Ann Miller), buying a night club and saving money to go to the Bahamas. But Carlito's past fellow criminals aren't leaving him alone, his nephew gets him in a shoot-out, his criminal turning lawyer David Kleinfeld (Golden Globe nominated Sean Penn) wants ""favours"", and an old friend wants the police to catch him. Carlito plans to escape to Florida, but he has gotten involved with the wrong people for one last ""favour"", and he is wrongly blamed for a mob boss's death, so they are chasing after him. It all comes to a head with Carlito asking Gail to wait for him at the train station, and the mob gag members are trying to catch and kill him. Even after killing them all, Carlito still catches a bullet from Benny Blanco (John Leguizamo) and betraying Pachanga (Luis Guzmán), but don't worry, he lives. Also starring Ingrid Rogers as Steffie, James Rebhorn as Dist. Atty. Norwalk and The Lord of the Rings' Viggo Mortensen as Lalin. Pacino makes a good restrained, gently lisping ex-criminal that can't get away from his past, the supporting cast, especially Penn and Miller make fantastic performances too, and the witty script from Spider-Man writer David Koepp makes this quite a watchable crime thriller. Very good!",Carlito's Way
9,rmax304823,Injustice is meted out.,7,24 January 2008,"It's quite a decent movie. Al Pacino is Carlito Brigante, a Puerto Rican New Yorker. Sean Penn is Kleinfeld, the lawyer who gets him out of the slams after only five years on a thirty-year sentence. Penelope Ann Miller is Gail, the old girl friend Carlito takes up with again after his return to the city.Pacino used to be a big drug dealer and, having learned some things about life, is now ready to retire, with the intention of taking his cut of some money from the club he partly owns and flying off to the Bahamas or someplace with Miller, there to open a car dealership. He wants out of a city in which everyone now seems more corrupt than before he went upstate, a city in which ""honor"" has become an almost meaningless word, useful only in coercing help from someone else, merely an instrument.""You owe me,"" says Penn. And Pacino, honor bound, must do favor after favor for the weaselly, duplicitous, coke-snorting lawyer including, finally, involvement in the murder of a Mafia member and his son. Penn does the killings. Pacino didn't even know about Penn's plans, but the mob holds him equally responsible.And while he is running his club and figuring out the details of his escape to the Bahamas, Pacino is forced to enact the role of a man so unyielding and unforgiving that he must brush off brash youngsters who would like nothing more than to take his place in the city's underworld.It's a complicated world that Pacino inhabits. He needs to juggle too many goals. At the end, he is betrayed by his best friend and brought down, just as he is about to board the train for Florida. I once heard a lecture in anthropology on Hispanic fatalism and thought at the time it was just another cooked-up thematic generalization. But subsequent experience has made me wonder. This film, including Pacino's narrative voice over, could have been written and directed by that anthropologist, . (Or by my fatalistic barber, Luisito, for that matter.) The acting is fine all around, with not a sour note. The direction is equally competent. No show-off directorial adventitions. Everything looks just about right, from Carlito's wardrobe (black leather coat) to the interior of his night club with its neon distractions. Penelope Ann Miller, in a dramatic role, is to die for, or at least to dance with. When this movie was made, Pacino could still run like hell, just as he did in ""Serpico."" Actually, the direction is fine, aimed at an adult audience. There is a shoot out at the end, almost obligatory by now, but it's preceded by a super-tense game of hide-and-seek in Grand Central Station, with four mob guys darting around and looking for Pacino, who is doing his best to get to Miller and the train. A less mature execution would have involved dozens of guys with Uzis and thousands of bullets and exploding glass windows and naked women taking showers and cars blowing up in fireballs and Niagras of blood and berserk speeding trains and endangered baby carriages and little old lady by-standers and murdered clowns -- and it all would have been carried out in slow motion. The director has done such things before. Not here. The fact that the story can generate so much suspense and excitement with a minimum of gore is a tribute to the people who put this together.",Carlito's Way
10,blanche-2,another great Pacino performance,7,24 November 2011,"Al Pacino does it ""Carlito's Way"" in this 1993 film, also starring Sean Penn, Penelope Ann Miller, John Leguizamo, with Adrian Pasdar and Viggo Mortensen in small roles. Directed by Brian de Palma, as others point out, it is inevitable to compare it to Scarface. However, each film deserves to stand on its own.Pacino here plays Carlito Brigante, an ex-drug lord who, when he gets out of prison, decides to go straight. The story is told in flashback. He needs $75,000 to buy into a car rental business with a friend of his in Florida. To get the money, he agrees to manage a sleazy nightclub. Well, going straight turns out to be not that easy. He has a cocaine-addicted lawyer (Sean Penn) with his own problems -- problems that affect Charlie (Carlito) negatively. Not to mention the fact that the people around him assume that he wants back in, when he doesn't. And he has to convince the girl he left behind (Miller) that he's changed and get her back into his life. It's all a big struggle.Truly excellent film with the usual de Palma violence, but the story is well told and the characters are fleshed out and interesting. Pacino is fantastic as a conflicted man who wants to help his friends but is determined to go straight. Sean Penn matches him in an excellent performance - these truly are two of our greatest actors. Penelope Ann Miller does a great job. Her character is in love with Charlie -- in fact, they're soulmates, but she can't bear to be around him if he hasn't gotten out of the life.A great script, fine direction, wonderful performances, a great soundtrack, great cinematography, a must see. Carlito's Way is suspenseful in spots, less violent than Scarface, and it's not as action-filled as Scarface because it also deals with a love story. Very compelling filmmaking.",Carlito's Way
11,Quinoa1984,"""If you can't see the angles no more, you're in trouble""- One of the best of 1993, a sublimely self-conscious crime picture",10,8 September 2003,"What makes conventions apart (not essential, but always there, like mildew in a shower) of the studio system of movies, as well as in the industry year in and year out, is that they set up the basic track lines for the viewer, to which then he or she can see if the re-treaded storyline will be more impressive than the last movie to take a convention to use.  Brian De Palma makes one of his best (and under-rated) films by letting the viewer be as self-aware of the on-coming chiches and pit-falls of the drama the story intones, just by the narration.  The aged, contemplative voice of Carlito Brigante (Al Pacino) that chimes in more often than not, is as essential to the way the story unfolds as Henry Hill's was to GoodFellas- this guys been on the inside, he knows the ropes, he knows the stakes, he knows the nature of the beast that goes with the people he associates with, and now that he's out of prison, he doesn't want it anymore.  Un-like a lesser film, we start to believe his intentions and reasonings.Carlito's just been released, thanks in part to his counselor David Kleinfeld (Sean Penn), five years gone in a thirty year sentence, and when he returns to the street many look at him as if he's changed hearing that he's retired.  Carlito just wants to get some money together, open a car dealership of sorts with a friend in the Bahamas, and works in a nightclub right smack dab in the heart of the coked up late 70's.  As Carlito's tale unfolds, so does Kleinfeld's, as an inmate who's a client of his makes a demand that he can't turn down, which in turn brings a perpetually reluctant Carlito along with him.  Another wise decision on De Palma's part was the casting: Pacino's screen presence is sometimes enough to be intimidating, but his performance as Carlito is the part of the heart of the movie (the other part is with Penelope Ann Miller as his estranged girlfriend), compelling, tough, and intelligent from years of dope dealing and soaking up the gang-land atmosphere around him.  Personally, I would put this over Tony Montana any day, if only because the accent rings truer as do his emotions.  Then there's Sean Penn as Kleinfeld, a scheming, vain little man who starts off seemingly as legitimate as a lawyer of criminals, but as we soon learn, he has slipped into a world that he has no place to belong in.  When I first saw little sections of this movie on TV, previous to recently watching it all the way through, I really didn't know who it was playing Kleinfeld, with his balding, curly hair and nervy, cranked voice appearing like it was Sean Penn, only as Woody Allen if he were ever an attorney.  However, when the viewer looks into his eyes, both terrified and ravenous, one can understand the pathway to excess that most conventional crime movies take for granted. 
Including supporting work by Penelope Ann Miller and John Leguizamo as the convincing critter Benny from the Bronx, and magnificent set-pieces that confirm De Palma's worth as a director of thrillers as well as dramas, this is an example of Hollywood movie-making that is waiting to be discovered over and over again, as proof of the value that can come in re-fashioning a genre piece.",Carlito's Way
12,edwagreen,Carlito Goes All The Way-Carlito's Way ****,10,31 December 2012,"Simply put, an outrageously great gangster film with Al Pacino, as usual, turning in still another phenomenal performance as a Puerto Rican gangster who wants to grow straight, but is eventually pulled into a situation which causes tragedy for him. He is equally matched by Sean Penn as a cocaine addicted lawyer who draws him in and Penelope Ann Miller, the girl he loved but tragically could not have.It's basically a well-crafted story of environment having its hold on people and trapping them once they have committed crimes.The music at the club that Pacino owns is absolutely fabulous with an array of popular songs for the period.",Carlito's Way

14,sunwarrior13,All About Carlito Brigante,10,18 August 2013,"Carlito's Way is a crime drama based on the novels Carlito's Way and After Hours by Judge Edwin Torres. The film adaptation was written by David Koepp. It stars Al Pacino and Sean Penn,together with Penelope Ann Miller, Luis Guzmán, John Leguizamo, and Viggo Mortensen in supporting roles. The story follows the life of Carlito Brigante after he is released from prison and vows to go straight and retire from criminal activities. However, unable to escape his past, he ends up being dragged into actions that got him imprisoned in the first place.The movie is narrated by Carlito himself, who explains his hopes, his strategies, and especially his mistakes. Brian De Palma directed the film.Carlito, a fabled heroin dealer, is released from prison after serving 5 years of a 30-year sentence. Tired and middle-aged, he wants out of the business as he has lost the juice for it—for the risks, the killing. It's the mid-'70s, the era of cocaine, fast sex, and disco glitz, and he takes a job running a dance club partially owned by his oldest and most trusted comrade, the coke-addled mob lawyer David Kleinfeld. Carlito's plan is to make some quick cash and move out of the country. But he is dragged down by his roots—by his hair-trigger survivor's instincts, honed while he was still a switchblade-wielding street kid, and by his loyalty to Kleinfeld, who tricks Carlito into helping him execute a mob hit.This film is one of the truly underrated films in the Brian De Palma and/or Al Pacino filmographies. It may have been unjustly derided and dismissed upon its theatrical debut during its year of release, but the it has received a cult following for many years now.The acting is great as the viewers are tickled by Sean Penn's weasely performance, Al Pacino's electric lead, or that crazy-cool chase through the NYC train station. Aside from its excellent performances,it has memorable moments, and some serious action and violent scenes. Overall,Carlito's Way is a smoother piece of filmmaking than Scarface, the only other picture De Palma has made with Pacino.",Carlito's Way
15,Theo Robertson,Why I Liked This Film,7,23 August 2002,"In reply to the people who`ve been coming on this site to ask what all the fuss is about I`ll point out that CARLITO`S WAY is an extremely well acted film . One thing I do admire about Pacino the actor is the fact he chooses quality over quantity . Look at De Niro in the past 10 years who`s appeared in some absolute crap like WE`RE NO ANGELS ,  THE FAN , and MEET THE PARENTS which leads me to believe that the star of TAXI DRIVER and RAGING BULL must be another actor called Robert De Niro . Pacino can never to accused of slumming it , and you know you`ll always be guaranteed an intense performance from him . Boy does Pacino give it 100% here. Amazingly Pacino didn`t even receive an Oscar nomination for this which is the best performance by an American actor from that year ( So much better than Tom Hanks ) , and he`s ably supported by Luiz Guzman and Viggo Mortensen and proving perhaps for the first time what an accomplished actor he is Sean Penn who was also strangely snubbed at the Oscar nominations . The only failure on the acting front is Penelope Ann Miller who plays the love interest",Carlito's Way
16,LeonLouisRicci,"""I am Born Again, just like the Watergaters!""",8,18 April 2014,There are Legitimate Comparisons to Director Brian De Palma and Al Pacino Teaming Up in Scarface (1988). But the Tone of this one is Quite Different. It is a More Subtle and Personal De Palma at Work here and the Same is True of Pacino.The Movie has some Outstanding Directorial Flourishes. The Pool Room Scene and the Climax Stand Out and are Vintage De Palma. Sean Penn is a Repulsive and Despicable Contrast to Carlito and makes the Reformed and Retired Drug Dealer that more Sympathetic as do the Romantic Elements with Penelope Ann Miller as an Emotional Anchor. The Film Creates the Gaudy Setting of the Disco Era in the Minority Community with Music and Fashion Authenticity. Although the Scene at the Lawyer's Mansion has a Feel of De Palma in Overdrive and comes close to Parody while the rest of the Film does not.Overall this is Top Tier De Palma and Mid Tier Pacino and it all Works Splendidly. It is a Violent and Gritty Neo-Noir with its Splashes of Brilliance at Times Mesmerizing. The Director and its Stars have All done Better but this is a Fine Film. The Camera Work is also worth Mentioning and Adds some Surreal Sensibility to the Straight Forward Drama/Action.,Carlito's Way
17,lastliberal,The dream don't come no closer by itself. We gotta run after it now.,8,1 September 2007,"Is there a bad Al Pacino performance? Maybe, but I don't recall seeing one. This was another great and gritty film with Pacino in the lead directed by Brian De Palma.The film also had superb performances by Sean Penn as David Kleinfeld: ""f*ck you and your self-righteous code of the goddamn streets. Did it pull you out of a 30 year stint in only 5 years? No, it didn't, I did. Did it get you acquitted 4 f*cking times? No, it didn't, I did, so f*ck you, f*ck the streets, your whole goddamn world is this big, and there's only one rule, you save your own ass.""

18,grantss,Great movie,9,2 April 2018,"More than simply a gangster movie, a great drama. Good plot, superb acting by Al Pacino and Sean Penn. And Brian De Palma's direction was excellent, for once more than a B-grade version of Martin Scorsese. (Scarface was another exception).",Carlito's Way
19,Boba_Fett1138,Just when he thought he was out they pull him back in!,9,14 September 2005,"This movie is yet another fine gangster movie with Al Pacino as the main lead. You might think that this movie adds little to the genre, also because it stars yet again Pacino in the main role as gangster. Well, this movie is surprising good and original enough which is also thanks to the always wonderful to look at style of directing by Brian De Palma, who before this with Pacino already made the much acclaimed gangster movie ""Scarface"".The movie its story is original and is about an ex-criminal who just got out of jail and is determined to stay on the good path and escapes his old life. But due to unforeseen circumstances and some old 'friends' he soon is, against his own will, pulled back again in the dark gangster underworld and activities of New York City. The movie features more than enough good and original moments and has plenty of memorable scene's.Of course once more the acting is top-class in this movie. Having Al Pacino playing the lead in a gangster movie is always jackpot and he once more succeeds in portraying a good and realistic character. Also truly excellent is Sean Penn in a role that you normally would never expect him in. John Leguizamo is also really good in a typical gangster role. The movie also features the now very well known Viggo Mortensen in one of his very first big movie roles.The movie has some good looking and professionally made shootouts and moments of violence. The whole ending at the train station really is the best part of the movie. Director Brian De Palma surely knows how to create some tense sequences and the end chase of this movie is once more proof of that.The movie has a fine musical score composed by Patrick Doyle. It's not always fitting for the movie but that doesn't take away that it's a good score.When you're a fan of gangster/crime movies this is an absolutely must see for you. Also for De Palma fans there is plenty to enjoy here. There are some typical De Palma moments and camera movements and the end sequences on the train station alone should be reason enough for De Palma fans to go and watch this movie.In my opinion this movie is even better than ""Scarface"".9/10http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/",Carlito's Way
20,view_and_review,"Not Godfather or Scarface good, but good",7,22 June 2020,"Al Pacino is pretty adept at playing the gangster: Michael Corleone, Tony Montana, and now Carlito Brigante. Unlike the former characters, Carlito had a desire to get out of the game. But you know how that is.1975, Carlito is released from Lewisburg Prison in New York. He re-enters a world that is different from the one he left and it's not long before he gets roped into trouble. How Carlito navigates the muddy waters of escaping the street life while also trying to earn enough money to ""retire"" is what this movie is all about. He has a renegade lawyer dragging him down played by Sean Penn, an old friend that's still a hothead played by Luis Guzman, and an up-and-comer trying to be him played by John Leguizamo.Matters only got more complicated when he hooked up with his old flame named Gail (Penelope Ann Miller). She was everything Carlito wasn't: blond, white, non-street. She didn't even call him Carlito, she called him Charlie as if with her he transformed into a different more socially acceptable person.""Carlito's Way"" is a good movie, but it can't touch ""The Godfather 2"" or ""Scarface.""",Carlito's Way
21,gridoon2021,"The flip side of ""Scarface"", and perhaps Brian De Palma's best film",8,24 April 2016,"Ten years after ""Scarface"", Brian De Palma and Al Pacino reteamed for another gangster tale; this time the title character that Pacino plays is older, wiser and more mature, and so is the director himself. De Palma remains a master of visual storytelling, creating moments of pure cinema (the climactic foot chase in Grand Central Station is a classic sequence), as the camera smoothly glides, swoops and tracks the characters. But this time, and this is often not the case in De Palma's films, the style is completely at the service of the story, which is an ironic tale of second chances, dreams, betrayal, and fate. Has there ever been a more emotional De Palma movie? To quote Pauline Kael's review for his ""Blow Out"", ""it's as if he finally understood what technique is for"". Al Pacino is rock-solid in this role, but he gets almost overshadowed by Sean Penn's brilliant, chameleonic turn. It's a great film. ***1/2 out of 4.",Carlito's Way
22,HotToastyRag,Classic Pacino flick,7,27 January 2019,"Did you not get enough of Al Pacino in Scarface? Good news, folks, because you can rent Carlito's Way, which will tide you over until the next time you watch Scarface. In this one, which is also directed by Brian De Palma, he plays a Puerto Rican ex-con who gets lured back into his old criminal ways despite the protestations of his girlfriend, Penelope Ann Miller. And while Penelope is no Michelle Pfeiffer, Al is significantly better looking as Carlito than Tony, with his beautiful long locks and a nicely cropped beard.This is going to sound crazy, but bear with me: Carlito's Way is a really good date movie. Ladies, if you've done something wrong and are in the doghouse, suggest this movie to your boyfriend to get back in his good graces. It's a very manly movie, with tons of violence and a storyline about being a bigger bad guy than the other bad guy-but you can chuckle to yourself as he thinks you're being entirely selfless, since there are also tons of steamy scenes with a handsome leading man. Is the famous scene where Penelope takes her clothes off behind a locked door really for the guys in the audience? Or is it so the girls in the audience can see Al lose control and break the door down?You're going to have to take the good with the bad during Carlito's Way. The good is, obviously, Al Pacino. This is a classic, typical Al Pacino movie with a crime-ridden plot and lots of violence, so if you like his usual movies, you'll be happy with this one. The bad is a less-than-stellar heroine who's rather stupid and a heavily disguised yet incredibly annoying sidekick, Sean Penn. The rest of the supporting cast is pretty good, though, with Luis Guzman as a loyal crony, John Leguizamo as the rival gang leader, and a young Viggo Mortenson in a small role. If you're still on the fence, watch the preview. It's a very accurate representation of this '90s drama.DLM Warning: If you suffer from vertigo or dizzy spells, like my mom does, this movie might not be your friend. There are a few scenes, including the first and last during which the camera spins, and that will make you sick. In other words, ""Don't Look, Mom!""Kiddy Warning: Obviously, you have control over your own children. However, due to language, violence, and sexual content, I wouldn't let my kids watch it.",Carlito's Way
23,The_Void,Brilliantly done crime flick,8,28 August 2005,"This film is often seen as the follow up to Brian De Palma's Scarface, and while the films share a logical line of progression and the same director and star, they're not related really. To be honest, I'm not a big fan of Scarface. That film has it's moments and a great powerful turn by Al Pacino; but it's also very messy, overlong and relies on it's good elements a bit too much. Carlito's Way suffers from some of the same problems that Scarface did; but on the whole, this is a much more assured, far better made and just generally superior crime flick. As mentioned, Al Pacino takes the lead role and is on fine form as the recently released criminal Carlito Brigante with the desire to go straight. Unlike most criminals, Carlito has realised that a life of crime is only going to lead him to an early grave, and has therefore decided to get out before it gets that far. However, things aren't so simple and when his lawyer friend David Kleinfeld who got him out of jail needs Carlito's help to get a client of his out of the can, it isn't long before Carlito realises that walking away is more difficult than it appears.I've never subscribed to the idea that Al Pacino is one of the greatest actors ever. He's good, but he chooses roles that are too similar far too often. This film sees him in another familiar place, but this time he brings more to the table than usual. The way that he bleakly reminisces is brilliant and this brooding performance is definitely one of his best. Al Pacino is the star of this film, but wrestling him for every scene they share is Sean Penn, who's on fine form! Penn gives life to the sleazy lawyer brilliantly, and it's impossible to watch this film and not absolutely hate his guts. The acting isn't what makes Carlito's Way what it is, however; it's the plot and style that do that. De Palma is well known for 'borrowing' from other directors, and a lot of this film feels like it could have been taken from an old crime movie. De Palma was at the height of his confidence with this film, and that is always evident. The plot is brilliantly thought-out, and it isn't too far away from truly great character pieces, the likes of William Shakespeare. The ironic ending being of particular note. Pacino's voice over gives the film it's final edge; it's haunting, the way that Carlito reflects upon his life of crime.",Carlito's Way
24,christopher-underwood,I have always rated this one and consider it one of de Palma's very best,9,18 November 2020,"Despite my slight prejudice against American gangster films, I have always rated this one and consider it one of de Palma's very best. I love his more psychological thrillers with The Fury (1978) a personal favourite but there is something magical about his relationship with Al Pacino that seems to help this, and the earlier Scarface (1983) to reach another level. We are as involved with with his wavering romantic liaison as we are with the violent action and the camera seems to love his every move, whether walking along a New York street or wielding a cue in the pool room. I think the boat rescue scene is a bit of a weak moment and this might be because we simply do not particularly care about the protagonists at this stage. Apart fro this possible lapse, however, the movie is faultless, with absolutely wonderful dance and nightclub scenes, seemingly so difficult for many directors, and a hard enough edge to maintain the tension brilliantly.",Carlito's Way

Al Pacino,(Carlito Brigante),""Chinese Coffee"",2000, gave an outstanding performance and is truly a great actor. There were many action filled scenes through out the film, however, the most exciting one was running through the subway cars and the shooting up of Grand Central Terminal on the escalators. Sean Penn(David Kleinfeld),""Up at the Villa,"",2000, got what he deserved for being such a two timing friend of Carlito.

This 1993 Crime-Drama, offers some really gripping & well-written moments, that truly hold your attention. Even the Direction is perfect, and the Performances are first-class. If there something missing here, it's clearly it's popularity. Al Pacino stars Carlito Brigante, A Puerto-Rican ex-con, just released from prison, who, pledges to stay away from drugs and violence despite the pressure around him, and lead on to a better life outside of NYC. It's his journey. Carlito Brigante is an interesting person to lead 'Carlito's Way'. His journey comes in-tact with strong violence, usage of drugs & blunt honesty. And cinematically, you try to understand Carlito, in this never-ending journey he has taken. It's a character, who despite a choosing a side, will again have to go the way, he just had left. It's a complicated, yet sympathetic character. David Koepp's Adapted Screenplay is mostly arresting & gripping. However, the culmination comes across as half-baked. It leaves you in mixed emotions and even the impact is missing. Brian De Palma's Direction is perfect. He handles the story of this one-person, with utmost patience & understanding. Cinematography is neat. Editing & Art Design, are satisfactory. Performance-Wise: Pacino gives Carlito Brigante, a soul, with his match-less performance here. Sean Penn is terrific. He stands out. Penelope Ann Miller is impressive. John Leguizamo does well. Jorge Porcel & James Rebhorn lend good support. On the whole, An Under-Rated Crime-Drama, That Deserves A Watch.",Carlito's Way
27,MovieAddict2016,"More human than ""Scarface.""",8,11 October 2005,"""Scarface"" was a great operatic film rooted in Greek tragedy, primarily the downfall of its protagonist related to his own hubris and pride. Its over-the-top theatrics and scenery-chewing acting complemented the absurdist tone of the film; some carping critics complained it was ""too violent,"" but it was silly violence...and it worked.""Carlito's Way"" is considered by many to be a companion piece of sorts to ""Scarface"" - but in its own ways it is vastly different. As ""GoodFellas"" differed a great deal from ""Casino"" in its narrative methods, ""Carlito's Way"" isn't as broad and theatrical as ""Scarface."" Of course, it's still a DePalma film, and that means we get some beautiful set pieces - but for the most part DePalma avoids his excessive visuals and instead opts for a balanced mixture of both storyline and directorial flair. It is not a sequel to ""Scarface"" - it is an expansion, and it seems entirely apt that its narrative is more mature, considering that Carlito Brigante (the main character) is wiser than Tony Montana from ""Scarface."" Carlito is a Puerto Rican ex-con who gets out of a thirty-year jail sentence based on a technicality after serving a mere five years of sentence. Faced with a new life and fresh horizons, he decides to heed the lessons he learned in jail and embark on a new and honest lifestyle.""Scarface"" was Greek tragedy insofar as Tony Montana was doomed to a downfall based on his own egotism and stubbornness. Like Oedipus in Sophocles' classic story, Montana was too bull-headed to take the advice of his wife and friends and was entirely responsible for his own emotional (and, in ""Scarface's"" case, physical) demise.""Carlito's Way"" is the flip side of the coin. It's still Greek tragedy, but it offers a new perspective. This time, the protagonist tries to change his fate, but his life is doomed to its inevitable conclusion. Carlito tries to change his ways, but - to paraphrase a character from another film - there is only one guarantee...Carlito Brigante will never see heaven. That's the fundamental truth of this movie, and DePalma's less showy camera-work, and the more mature characterizations by the actors, and the believable script, ensure that ""Carlito's Way"" is an entirely human experience - far more so than ""Scarface."" (Which is still a great film based on its own goals.)",Carlito's Way
28,Red-Barracuda,A fine gangster film,7,29 August 2015,"Brian De Palma's Carlito's Way is like a 90's version of his 80's cult classic Scarface (1983). Both star Al Pacino as the lead character who is a gangster from an ethnic minority group. Unlike Tony Montana, however, Carlito Brigante is tired of his life of crime and wants a way out. He is a former drug dealing gangster who tries to escape his past after being released early from jail on a technicality. He re-starts a relationship with a stripper who tries to keep him on the straight and narrow, while at the same time his sleazy lawyer slowly drags him back into crime. The action revolves around the Puerto Rican criminal underground in 70's New York.The film benefits from De Palma's stylised and technically accomplished direction, with some bravura set-pieces including a well-staged shoot-out in a pool hall and a pursuit scene in Grand Central Station which includes a highly impressive long single-take mobile camera shot. The film also benefits from fine acting from its two leads. Al Pacino gives a very measured performance as Carlito, a character with a lot more to him than gangster bravado, while Sean Penn may be even better as Dave Kleinfeld the sleazy lawyer; Penn also has to be given special mention for donning a truly eye-poppingly repulsive wig throughout – now that is what I call suffering for your art! The disco era period detail is well delivered and adds another welcome aspect. If I had to criticise it would be to say that it is probably a bit overlong and could surely have told this story in a slightly more concise manner. But on the whole, this is an impressive bit of work.",Carlito's Way
29,KineticSeoul,Engrossing crime drama with romantic element that gets better as it progresses,7,22 December 2011,"This is one of Al Pacino's greats, not sure if it's one of his best but it's still a good street movie. The story is about a man Carlito 'Charlie' Brigante(Al Pacino) who comes out of prison to start a new life but like other movies like this the past always come to haunt the man that tries to escape it. Al Pacino plays a character that is difficult to get use to with the street slang and the accent he uses. But after a while I got used to it, he plays a guy that goes by the code of the street and loyalty means everything to him to the point he will go to difficult length because of his loyalty and his street code ethics. So yeah even criminals have codes and ethics they go by and this man is a guy that goes by it no matter what. I wasn't quite sure I should like his character or not in the beginning but he becomes likable as the movie progresses, I mean he isn't the nicest guy and goes balls to the wall when he needs to, but he is likable because of his ethic and loyalty. This movie starts off a bit slow and might take a while for some to get there attention but it really does as it progresses and as the characters develop some more. The romantic element also works in this and has some good twist that is well developed. The acting is really good and for the most part believable, even the side characters are fun to watch because of there mannerism and they way they speak while also being believable. Anyone that likes gangster movies with a bit of romantic element will probably enjoy this.7.6/10",Carlito's Way
30,Robert_duder,An Epic of a different sort...Pacino blows you away,8,4 February 2007,"Carlito's Way is sure to go down as one of Pacino's great accomplishments and another great accomplishment but gritty crime director Brian De Palma. The thing that surprised me about Carlito's Way was it's heart. Amidst it's action and drama, and gory scenes and foul language was some real emotion...a love story...a man determined to turn his life around but doesn't quite get to escape it all because of one wrong choice. Brilliantly cast, and brilliantly directed Carlito's Way is like an epic journey of this man's life. We are shown what he used to be through the eyes of those around him while we are shown the way he wants to be right now after being released from prison on a technicality. In essence De Palma shows us two completely different sides of the same man in the same picture...that's brilliance.What can you say about Al Pacino?? Does he truly ever do wrong?? Not in this film. His portrayal as the wanna-be changed Puerto Rican Drug Runner Carlito Brigante is brilliant...an iconic film character. He's a complete anti-hero by definition because he's the furthest thing from a hero but you truly want him to succeed in escaping his past and living life out with his girl. Pacino is such a versatile actor and this role gives him the range to show us every emotion possible. He is perfect for the role. Sean Penn (not one of my favorite actors) does a very good job in a barely recognizable role as Carlito's slimy, underworld attorney David Kleinfeld who Carlito feels great loyalty to as one of his only friends and for helping him get released from prison. Penn truly is slimy as Kleinfeld and you are in the position that everyone else in the film is in...you don't understand Carlito's loyalty to him that ultimately leads to his downfall. Penelope Ann Miller is the love of Brigante's life that he returns to and convinces her to leave with him and escape the life of crime. Miller and Pacino do have great chemistry together and even their sex scene is quite steamy and well filmed. Miller's role comes across as a little whiny and needy but perhaps that is the character. John Leguizamo plays a small but very vital role in the film as a local hood that runs drugs the same as Carlito did and idolizes Carlito until he gets the cold shoulder. Leguizamo is appropriately sleazy and bad and great for this role.Certainly shot with a gritty and nasty appearance of New York's underside. Shot from key locations including Grand Central Station the film is riveting and easily one of the great films of the nineties if not severely under appreciated. The film was based on a series of books and De Palma could have easily made it feel like we were missing a history of this man but you never feel that way. Instead you feel like you get to know him through the other people, and dealers and old friends and compare it to the new Carlito, desperate to escape. This is an absolute must see for fans of Pacino, De Palma or Crime drama in general. It's an absolute classic!! 8.5/10",Carlito's Way
31,ElMaruecan82,The Tragedy of Carlito Brigante ...,9,30 December 2011,"1993 was a very interesting year for gangster films, Robert De Niro and Al Pacino, the veteran (always rivaled) actors who define the genre like the Cagney and Robinson of their generation, starred in two films that are, in my opinion, pivotal in the evolution of the gangster genre, respectively ""A Bronx Tale"" and ""Carlito's Way"". These two films are less similar in their method than the overall approach which tends to depict the gangster lifestyle with the same seductive/destructive dimension than other classics, transcended by a psychological dimension. Whether it's between crime and family or crime and honesty, the main characters suffer from an intolerable contradiction, their souls are like trees whose branches try to reach the sky of a honest and decent life, while the roots are already poisoned by the devil.Al Pacino never collaborated with Scorsese but there's something very Scorsesian in Carlito's character, a man of principles, lured into his own demons while trying to defeat them. Carlito is surrounded by many characters who all sin by naivety or treachery, on the top of them, his lawyer, the crooked Kleinsfeld, Sean Penn in a performance that should have earned him an Oscar nomination for Best Supporting Role. The only oasis of purity in this ugly setting is Gail (Penelop Ann Miller) the woman he loved before and still love after jail. Things have changed for worse since he was released but Gail would remain pure to be the guiding light of Carlito's heart in his soul's darkness. But the weight of Carlito's past apparently prevents him from taking off for a brighter horizon. Brian De Palma, on the road again with Al Pacino, signs another gangster classic, working like a sort of revisionist version of ""Scarface"", less flashy and flamboyant, but with a depth so hypnotic it might have cost him the same iconic success of its glorious predecessor.Carlito is a Puerto-Rican criminal who spent five years in jail and through the help of the barely recognizable Sean Penn, got his ass out of jail before the end of sentence. The speech Carlito gives in the beginning has a sort of showiness which I always thought not to belong to such a serious character, but the more I think of it, the more I realize that this is the realistic enthusiastic reaction of a man who feels like being born again, having a new chance. This 'new chance' is the defining element of Carlito aka Charlie, a strong desire to go forward and turn the back on an obscure past. This is ""Carlito's Way"": look forward and never turn your back, the tragedy of his character is that the same mindset that would prevent him from committing a mistake will ultimately sign his own death warrant.Now, I wonder if I should mention that the review contains 'spoilers', is it spoiling the film to say that Carlito dies at the end? the film clearly opens with the scene where he's shot by an unknown face. Who did it? Why? These questions don't matter since it leaves no doubt about Carlito's fate (he got enough bullets not to make us expect a happy twist ending) The gravity of the opening credits contrasts with the joyful courtroom scene and Charlie's celebration of his victory over Law with Kleinsfeld, but it creates something powerful that a few movies managed to achieved: the tragedy. Carlito's story is a tragedy because the inevitability of his death is already painted in bloody letters implying that all his actions will ultimately be swept off by the wind of futility. If he's dead, it's because he didn't see it coming, and from someone who decided not to look behind, this is one of the likeliest things to happen.""Dead-End"" this is the French title of ""Carlito's Way"", and the word itself conveys the inevitability of Carlito's death, even his clothing, his dark hair and beard, and his leather jacket are the mark of a deadly presence watching him. Evolving in the 70's disco era, with all its flashiness and abundance of sex, drugs and violence, Carlito hardly gets incognito; a serious handicap for someone who just wants to finds his place. Carlito wants to make enough money to work for a friend in the Bahamas. Like in ""Scarface"" a criminal massacre plays a pivotal role as he finds enough money to invest from a drug deal incident which he's the only survivor, in both cases, we see the reality which Montana wanted to plunge in and Carlito wanted to leave. Carlito's way is a journey between two worlds trying to trap him, Law and Crime, with many obstacles, treacheries, and betrayals. But we end up realizing that Carlito's most dangerous enemy is Carlito.His torment can be compared to a sort of cat-and-mouse chase between two sides of his soul, culminating with the real cat-and-mouse chase sequence, which remains one of Brian De Palma's greatest contributions on the field of cinematic thrills. Now, should the movie have started with Carlito's death? I say 'yes' because otherwise, we would never stop complain about some of his unwise decisions, despite the way he justified them. The film is not about the tragedy but the reasons of this tragedy, reasons that make Carlito one of Al Pacino's most appealing characters. And if we have the feeling of being ahead of him all the time, feeling an imminent danger coming in that direction, we forget that the danger will always come from behind, and the irony is that he couldn't see it, because he was too busy walking, and sometimes running forward, but like in some of our most disturbing nightmares, he was also going backwards to finally meet his demise.This is the tragic aspect of ""Carlito's Way""  with the light of hope incarnated by Gail's pure figure and something of Carlito growing inside her  well maybe the ""Dead-End"" title is misleading after all",Carlito's Way
32,ThomasDrufke,"""If you can't see the angles no more, you're in trouble""",8,22 October 2019,"In the years since, there have been plenty of films about characters trying to get out of or 'escape' the troubled life they're living. There's something infinitely appealing about watching characters who can't quite leave their criminal life, and perhaps no one plays them better then Robert De Niro and Al Pacino. Pacino plays the titular character this time around, surrounded by early turns from Sean Penn, John Leguizamo, and Viggo Mortensen. Much like several other classic Pacino performances, Carlito's Way is an excellent showcase of his talent, and a time when crime films were a whole lot better than they are now (for the most part).

The opening shows Carlito Brigante, former criminal, being hauled away in a stretcher, covered in blood after being shot. Well, now I know how the film ends. The suspense of the film's climax is ruined if we immediately know his fate. Duh! Pacino (surely more deserving of an Academy Award here than he was for his overrated performance in Scent of a Woman) narrates us through the last week or so of Carlito Brigante's life as he is let out of jail after five years out of thirty for mitigates circumstances coming to light. Determined to go straight, Carlito shrugs off all advances from crooks old and new but is eventually drawn back into a quagmire of trouble by his cokehead lawyer (Sean Penn dressed up as Disco Stu from The Simpsons, who also deserved to take home a Best Supporting Actor Oscar)The 145 minute running time passes in a breeze and there's loads of interesting story developments to keep you hooked. But DePalma's sterile widescreen photography and sets reek of the crassness of Scarface. This film is miles ahead of that junk (but let's not get into a debate about that) though I do think that a more vivid production design and cinematography and slicker editing would have stopped the film from looking so bland.I don't think DePalma is a great director but I do enjoy Carlito's Way, The Untouchables and Snake Eyes.

The acting by all of these actors is very good. Pacino is really excellent in this film. Mortensen and Ann Miller are as well. The suspense is really good and the action scenes are very good. The movie is filmed very good. The music is good by Patrick Doyle. Brian De Palma directed the film excellently! The film is quite interesting and the movie really keeps you going until the last moment. This is a very good and thrilling film. If you like Al Pacino, Sean Penn, Penelope Ann Miller, and the rest of the cast in the film, action thrillers, dramas, and interesting films then I strongly recommend this film!",Carlito's Way
40,Dr_Coulardeau,So human and yet so cruel,10,28 September 2009,"A gangster in New York gets thirty years in prison. But his lawyer manages to have that reduced to five years. He is truly trying to remain clean and to make some rather honest money in a club, though he gets the necessary investment from a bad deal that had cost the life of a few people. He was only an asset to a younger dealer, a recommendation, a referee if you want, aired and exhibited by the younger one. But that younger one was dealing with young gangsters and of course they tricked him into dying, losing his money and getting nothing, except that Carlito puts things right, to his own and sole benefit. But he has to deal with a vast Italian family in his club and outside. The main twist in the plot is that the lawyer who rescued him out of prison had been dealing with these gangsters, and this family in particular, even trapping one in prison after appropriating the million dollars this particular gangster had made in his business. But a lawyer will always be an amateur gangster and he drags Carlito into the last act of his own drama. That will cost their lives to the lawyer, Carlito and half a dozen members of the family in the brilliant setting of Grand Central Station. At the very moment when he could have walked out of this life of outcast crime, he is reminded that the leash that is attached around his neck will never disappear. This film has some depth somewhere about the great ease with which honest people can become dishonest, and at times with the idea that they are not dishonest since the people they steal or rob are thieves themselves. The code of the street is all powerful and definitely stronger than any law imaginable. The film is brilliant too as an action film, even, this time with suspense and great actors, Al Pacino being doubled up by Sean Penn. Brilliant rendering of the dilemma of a drug lord turned old and would-be honest.Dr Jacques COULARDEAU, University Paris 1 Pantheon Sorbonne, University Paris 12 Créteil, CEGID",Carlito's Way
41,johnnyboyz,A brilliantly told crime/character relations drama with plenty of principals going for it.,10,11 October 2006,"'Carlito's Way' is another fantastic example of a film chronicling the rise 'and rise' and fall of a petty gangster. This time there's a bit of a twist in the initial narrative as the gangster anti-hero is attempting to 're-rise' the hierarchy, albeit briefly for cash purposes, upon being released form prison.I really and genuinely liked Carlito's Way. I thought it was funny, well paced, contained likable/dislikeable characters to whom you could really get stuck into as a viewer and just generally held its own for two hours. What I really liked about the film was the use of mise-en-scene; particularly the use of setting and lighting. It seemed that different shades and tones were used for different scenes and moods. The colour red was used to distinguish danger and warnings where as other, lighter colours acted as relief. Examples can be when the colour red was used in the club scenes. Confrontation is always a possibility with eventual party-pooper 'Benny from the Bronx' when the club is the setting and this continuous threat acted nicely with the lighting, just as the red lighting in the strip club when Carlito sees his love interest working there, it has a sort of 'shock factor' to it as he feels confrontation with his own emotions and probably a little bit of a heart broken feeling, also.Whenever this red light crops up in the film, Carlito is facing danger and/or conflict with himself or others and it is threatening his American dream of moving to the Caribbean. Thus, the lighting signals where and when he'll have is conflicts along his journey to a retirement of some sort.The feel the film has to it is also very realistic. When Carlito is involved in an early shoot out in a bar, he is taking cover in the toilets and is genuinely concerned about the dangers that lie in the bar area waiting for him and although he doesn't realise he's already done the business, he treats the situation like it's critical; issuing threats, buying time and trying to think up a plan of escape even though there's no need.Al Pacino really pushes home his character in this film. We see the two sides of Carlito at numerous, well paced times and it's a real treat. The reformed, kind hearted Carlito is blended in very well with the once violent, ruthless, professional Carlito that ultimately got him into prison in the first place. This reminds us that there are two sides to him and alters our opinion on him throughout. The violent distractions that frustratingly pop up for Carlito act as a mental subplot in the film and they really add to the character and to the experience of the film.This is well directed, well thought out and well acted. The action scenes, shootouts, dialogue driven scenes and love interest scenes are all blended in very well and make for a superb, gritty action-crime drama.",Carlito's Way

There, he has the support of an amazing director, Brian De Palma, thus their union is quite explosive, all the more they tell the impossible fate of a crime boss who repents.Watching his last moments are quite gripping, because you know that whatever his best efforts, his purest intention, he can't escape what it's waiting. Sure, it's a fantastic example of courage and bravery, but it's also the total opposite, the harshest reality, the saddest discouragement because you know that whatever you do, it won't be enough! For such a great character, it needed the best actor and Al gives it all: I never seen him so charismatic: silent and explosive, big heart and cold hate.. and what about his look: superb beard and fantastic wardrobe! A moment: his expression when he rejoices Gail! His face is really touched by the power of love! And don't forget De Palma! A great director is before all, an ""eye"" and De Palma doesn't need glasses! His camera is alive. You can feel her pulse and really share his vision.I can't compare it with ""Scarface"" having not yet watch it, but ""Carlito"" is really close to ""Godfather III"", the later having only a better score!

44,imseeg,Very slick and romanticized gangster story.,8,10 January 2019,"Miles apart from the gore of Al Pacino's ""Scarface"", this movie is definitely made to please the masses, with a very slick and romanticized gangster story full of romantic love scenes and glorified cool gangster poses. Suited for 12 years and older. Lots of violins, lots of worn out gangster cliches, but in the end ""Carlito's Way"" is still a nice old fashioned gangster story to pass the time with and dream away from the real world.Al Pacino ofcourse is the star that makes this movie shine bright, although he looks somewhat as a hairdresser with his tightly trimmed beard and shiny slick hairdo. That shiny and slick look suits the role he plays of a gangster who swore that he has retired from crime. Will he hold that promise when his criminal lawyer friend (Sean Penn) gets into trouble with the mob? Or will he be pulled back into the sewer of gangster violence?Direction is done well but very slick. Everything from editing, to soundtrack and photography is slick and shiny. That in itself isnt bad, because it creates a great looking gangster picture, but my only criticism would be that it is a bit too shiny and and a bit too romantically slick to be a real gangster movie. It's definitely marketed as a date movie for the masses. Great fun to watch for sure, but for those who wanna see a true hardcore gangster movie better watch Al Pacino in his younger years in ""Scarface"".",Carlito's Way
45,videorama-759-859391,Way to go Al,8,2 November 2015,"C.W. is a perfect example of a well crafted pic of even flow, a tight well executed mafia piece. Too, it's the deeply written characters of the three mains, that make this pic work well. We really feel for the newly released Carlito (Pacino) evading a much six time longer sentence, owing it too much to scuzzy lawyer Kleinman (Penn), unsurpassable in this, bringing so much depth to a character, who just engrosses us from day one. It's a riveting performance with the fuzzy wuzzy, kind of Leo Sayer hair do. Pacino again brings another masterpiece of a performance, his way, like Carlito, who before his stint in prison, was the Puerto Rico bad arse drug lord. But here, he truly wants to go straight, trying to dodge the surrounding corrupt forces, trying to suck him back in, and won't foil his plan to make enough money, to take off with his reunited sweetheart Gail (Penelope Ann Miller, really sexy in this, and like Penn and Pacino, has a meaty character to work with. Carlito also has a real arch enemy lawyer, riding his tail, so wanting him back inside, where like one scene in it's starting, where Carlito theatrically, addresses the court, that makes a smarmy, with his victory, it's so much fun again where these two rivals, are back in the same room. The first dying scene, may'be we could of done without, as it would of been much more intriguingly suspenseful, especially nearing it's closing in a wonderfully orchestrated shootout scene, to see if Carlito was gonna beat em', but like we know in many other examples, that's rising a flimsy chance and desperate hope. Carlito's choices, about doing things his way, made sense to. The other shootout scene, much earlier, unconsciously for me, drew homage to the other but bloodier betrayal shootout + chainsaw slicing scene in the early part of Scarface. That's what it really felt like to me, in this reuniting of Pacino and De Palma reuniting pic, with a great beaty Cuban tune, accompanied. The script is really good, I must say, too, and Viggo Mortennsen's performance of a pathetic wheelchair bound ex con, Puerto Rican, who's wired up you could say, must claim mention. Also John Leguizamo as a new wannabe gangster, Benny Blanco, moving up, but not favored by Carlito, who reminds him of what he used to be, gives some of his best work, while truly creating a memorable bad mafia dude. C.W. is so enjoyable, it passes quite fast through it's 144 minute duration, but it's a film that must be seen, on all accounts.",Carlito's Way

The latter produced a compelling narrative with fantastic performances from his cast (De Niro, Joe Pesci and Ray Liotta) and a hard-line message. Not so Brian De Palma however.De Palma's inconsistency has never been in doubt, it's always prevalent. Yet surely one would question a man who casts Al Pacino first as a Cuban (""Scarface"") and then as a Puerto Rican. Pacino is the most Italian looking guy in Hollywood. Mind you he gives a professional performance, and Sean Penn, as his corrupt Jewish lawyer, is again outstanding.""Carlito's Way"" is impressively shot too, but De Palma lets the film ramble on too long, and makes the mistake of showing the conclusion of the story at the beginning of the show (ala ""Intersection""). A shorter, more action-thriller type approach would have worked much better than this failed endeavour.

While there are some similarities between the two films as they both deal with Latino gangsters and both are great looking movies greatly benefited by Brian De Palma's use of lush visuals.

He is joined by Sean Penn as a sleazy lawyer who Carlito goes into business with running a nightclub.Penelope Ann Miller is stunning as his woman and Luis Guzman is cool as always as Carlito's right hand man.

But the five years left an impression on Carlito. He is going clean, he has a dream to move to Bahamas and rent cars to tourists. To do that he needs some money. He is set up by his friend and lawyer Kleinfeld to manage a disco. But no one really believes he is clean and the DA is out for him. Carlito struggles to keep clean and also rekindles his relationship with Gail, the woman of his dreams. But Kleinfled has some trouble with his mafia-clients and Carlito is a man that helps his friends. Even if it means trouble...Comments: First off, I believe this move could have been a lot better with just a simple adjustment. If it had not shown the ending at the beginning, the entire movie would have benefited. Now you know how it's going to end, right from the start. And its not too hard to figure out who either. Otherwise it is a well made movie, but it has its faults. For one, its very front heavy. By that I mean that it puts a lot of time to establish characters and the environment, and it almost seem like they panicked when it came to the ending, realizing they didn't have much time left to do it in. So the ending is simple, predictable and very short.The best part of the production is the acting. The entire cast gives a very strong performance with Pacino and Penn leading the way. Those two are exceptional. I also was impressed by Mortensen's short scene. But when the story is too slow, the acting matters less, unfortunately. So I can't rate higher than a (even though the acting almost deserves more)...6/10",Carlito's Way

Adapted from the novels by Edwin Torres, Carlito's Way, may seem long to some, but it is a linear story that is bold and assertive, yet equally slick when it wants to be. So what exactly is the problem? How about the fact that the opening credits are over a montage with spoils the climax big time. I feel a little insulted. I guess in the end, it doesn't do severe damage. The climax is only moderately climactic, in part because it is spoiled....anyway.The curtain rises on a courtroom in session. Former New York drug king Carlito Brigante has gotten off the hook, thanks to a good lawyer. He is planning to go strait, raise a few thousand dollars, and start a car rental business, after getting back with his old gal (now a club dancer). One night however, his lawyer asks him to do a bloody favour, (actually he begs him). Carlito very unwilling to do so helps his friend, but things go south and suddenly Carlito is in danger again, from the cops. When they give him a chance to make good, does he take it or risk almost certain death by following his plan for the sake of his future with his girl.All in all, Carlito's Way does its job.

Film also has a great performances by the whole cast. By Pacino that never lets us down in any of his performances. We have Sean Penn in a great part as Kleinfeld as he falls down the path of corruption that we hardly recognize him with big bald frizzy hair. Also some performances by Luis Guzman, John Lequizamo & Viggo Mortensen in some their first parts. Guzman now get lots of the best supporting parts their are. Leguizamo is a great comedian & serious actor with a career already. And Mortensen, that is one the best actors around.Directed by Brian de Palma (""Carrie""), this is one of the most realistic, and historic accurate pictures of life in New York City's urban jungle during the late 1970's/early 1980's. Brian De Palma had just come off a lukewarm reception for yet another Hitchcock homage, ""Raising Cain"" and was in need of a hit to appease the studios. And so, a re-teaming with Al Pacino in an effort to recreate the magic of ""Scarface"" made commercial sense. ""Carlito's Way"" was much more sombre in tone than the cinematic shotgun blast that is Scarface. It is a tragedy about how a criminal tries to go straight but is ultimately doomed from the get-go. Penelope Ann Miller (""Adventures in Babysitting"" is great as Brigante's love interest, and Luis Guzman always is a scene-stealer playing Pacino's right-hand man. ""Carlito's Way"" is a fantastic film that is sad in a sense, but states a sad truth.

55,eric262003,The Direction Compliments Nicely to the Performances,9,19 May 2014,"Under the careful direction of Brian De Palma written by David Koepp based on two novel by Edwin Torres, ""Carlito's Way"" tells the story of Puerto Rican criminal Carlito Brigante (Al Pacino) who after being released from jail for five years from a thirty year sentence thank mainly to his committed lawyer friend Kleinfeld (Sean Penn) is now focusing on trying to live off that horrid past by going straight. Feeling grateful towards Kleinfeld for getting him off early, Kleinfeld tells him to open up a nightclub that runs properly in which Carlito gladly obliges. Carlito thinks this will pave his way toward his goal to run a car selling business in a warmer climate.Unfortunately, Carlito discovers that Kleinfeld is nothing more than an untrustworthy shyster. Carlito has to put up with an excited and enthusiastic urchin named Benny Blanco (John Leguizamo), who think he's some punk kid who toughness is just an act to blend in. Carlito seeks towards his old sweetheart Gail (Penelope Ann Miller) who has ambitions to become a ballet dancer, but is struggling to make ends meet as she lowers herself to stripping. There are a myriad of memorable scenes where Gail tries to persuade Carlito to get away from the people he's dealing with fearing that it could put him into serious trouble or at the very worst, death.I may have mentioned that Kleinfeld was a corrupt little weasel, but that was an understatement. He's also a coke-addict and a conniving thief, who finds himself in a precarious situation and depends on Carlito as a way to try to get him out. Feeling like he's going to regret this sooner or later, decides to help him out on account the Kleinfeld released him from jail earlier than expected. next thing you know the Italian mafia is on the hunt after Carlito and Kleinfeld. Carlito does everything to escape from their clutches and to prevent Gail from getting involved. From the opening scenes, this crime drama of a film has a tragedy subtly implanted in the script which adds more bravado to what the story is intended to be.Viggo Mortensen is in a small supporting role as Lalin, a once powerful leader of a Hispanic mob, is now reduced to cutting deals with the cops and is now confined to a wheelchair. Feeling like there's no point in living as he begs Carlito to kill him, Carlito, out of pity and reluctance decides to finish him off.The poetic and power themes of the story is quite sublime. It's not a mindless violent gangster movie, in fact, the violence is few and far between. Instead it focuses on how humans degrade themselves and how life on the streets has an impact towards individuals who simply just want to live in peace and harmony. There's one great tender scene where Carlito tells Gail about a moment when he was 13, he had a fight he wanted no part of, but had to defend himself because he had to in order to survive. It tells you what you must do to ensure you throw back what life throws at you.The performers were pretty much impressive as a whole. The strange thing was that the movie is centered around Latino characters, with the exceptions of Leguizamo and Luis Guzman, the rest of the performers were not of Latino extraction. Pacino, who's Italian has a funny scene where the Italian mafia actually mistook Carlito for being Italian because of his physical complexion. Penn looks greatly transformed as a Jewish lawyer complete with the curly frizzy hair. Mortensen, is not very convincing playing Hispanic. Makes you wonder, with a plethora of Latino performers, why didn't De Palma search widely for more Latino performers to play these characters? It would have been more realistic.",Carlito's Way
56,Sandcooler,The worst of times,9,6 September 2008,"One of the classic crime epics, a genre I personally can't get sick of. Brian de Palma does his best to stick to what he's good at and I won't say he's rehashing his previous work, but there are elements that keep returning. Dark night clubs, sordid back alleys, bad neighbourhoods, stereotypical gangsters and movie violence, we've dealt with it before. The obligatory central idea this time is that crime doesn't pay, as expressed through the tone of the narration, there's an undying sadness to it. Carlito Brigante tries to steer clear but it's simply no use, and though there are some moments when things are actually looking fairly good, you never really feel at ease. You're not supposed to. Al Pacino is a great actor, but it's Sean Penn who's really giving a once in a lifetime performance. His character doesn't fit into a category, he's just some really bad person. Sadly this film still has too much of a ""more if the same"" feel to it, it doesn't bring much new to the table. Of course it's still great, de Palma knows what he's doing.",Carlito's Way
57,winner55,"Overlong B-movie, well-made but....",6,12 August 2007,"Whether DiPalma likes it or not, the audience is entitled to think of this as the B-movie companion piece to ""Scarface"", since DiPalma is mapping the same terrain with assist from ""Scarface"" star Pacino once again playing an Hispanic mobster in the late 1970s. However, all the play-it-to-the-max ballsiness of the older film has been lost. And that the Pacino character here is a reformed mobster, much older and mellower than Scarface could ever hope to become, only excuses this in part - specifically, the sappy romanticism that finds its focus on the relationship between Carlito and Gail - which would be wholly unbelievable if this clearly weren't a B-movie to begin with, with all the plot-loops, stereotypes, ""message"" and daffy sentimentalism that implies.Still, even granting all this, there's a lot wrong here; That the Italians that show up at Carlito's club at the end all have names of the Family bosses of New York may have seemed witty when written, but unfortunately serious mob-watchers - and mob-movie watchers - may feel at first confused and then disappointed - the film seems to be playing for realism here, but it's only a joke after-all. Sean Penn starts the film at top form, but somewhere along the line decides it's not worth the effort, and he's almost right. Pacino himself seems to be running out of energy - his Spanish accent in ""Scarface"" was overdone, but was consistent with the character; here, he wanders into southern drawl, general Manhattanese, and 'Donnie Brasco' 'wop' (no offense, you know what I mean), trying to find some focus to his character that will explain his pulling punches while leaving him an edge. But he doesn't make it; Carlito feels like the wimp others think he's become. And when he needs his smarts most, they let him down - not just his smarts, but his actor, his director and his writer. Finally one has to remark the late '70s kitsch filling the background here. We saw this kitsch before, in ""Scarface"", where it played an important role in defining the emptiness of the culture Montana so desperately wants to dominate; here, it just floats around in the background, largely unfinished (those Afros! not every brother wore them in those days!), taking up space.But the real problem here is that a B-movie ""Scarface"" companion piece ought to be a distillation of the action episodes with some swift dialog to hold it together. This film is WAY too long and drawn-out. DiPalma used his slower moments in ""Scarface"" to give us rich set-pieces of humor and irony, like the cunnilingus-gesture pick-up scene, or the wildly gaudy room-sized bubble-bath scene. Here, the slow moments are filled with, well - talk; and if the talk were interesting, these would be bearable; but it's not, so they aren't.It's a well-made and watchable crime-story, but it not only pretends to more, it could have been more, much more; so it doesn't even get ""B"" for effort.",Carlito's Way

(R)De Palma reteams with Pacino for another gangland saga and manages to top ""Scarface""; Pacino again plays a Latino gangster (Puerto Rican this time, instead of Cuban), but after a five-year prison stint, he actually wants to go straight--you know what they say about good intentions, though. Script by David Koepp (based on two Edwin Torres novels) is full of familiar scenes and types, and some of the dialogue could have used a punch-up (the final piece of narration from Pacino is hoary enough to earn laughs), but its basic tale of a reformed crook undone by an outdated code of honor is a solid one, and De Palma brings his usual flashy bag of tricks to make the cinematic qualities jump off the screen. Pacino is an arresting screen presence (as expected), though he seems to be wavering between his sybaritic ""Scarface"" thug and his cantankerous ""Scent of a Woman"" colonel; Penn, nearly unrecognizable as his sleazy cokehead lawyer, is even more exuberant, a dangerous high-wire act of a performance; Miller, sexy but vulnerable, brings more to the ""gangster moll"" role than most others before her. The climactic chase starting at a nightclub and ending up in Grand Central Station is a virtuoso piece of filmmaking, but the suspense is diluted because the audience already knows the outcome from the opening credits!78/100",Carlito's Way

61,sme_no_densetsu,A somewhat overlooked gem from de Palma & Pacino,8,16 August 2019,"When it comes to crime dramas starring Al Pacino and directed by Brian de Palma, the first film that naturally comes to mind is ""Scarface"". Released in 1983, ""Scarface"" is arguably the definitive gangster movie of the 80's, so the attention that it gets isn't undeserved. However, what a lot of people don't know (or have forgotten) is that de Palma & Pacino teamed up again ten years later for a markedly different gangster movie.""Carlito's Way"" features a more world-weary Pacino as a recently released convict who just wants to put his past behind him and fly straight long enough to retire to a comfortable but not extravagant lifestyle. Unfortunately, it isn't long before his acquaintances drag him back into the world of crime. Reluctantly bound by loyalty, Carlito's carefully laid plans start to unravel and it seems that he'll be lucky just to get out alive.In the lead role we have Al Pacino, just one year removed from his long-overdue Best Actor Oscar win for ""Scent of a Woman"". He shows some bluster in the opening courthouse scene but, for the most part, his performance is nicely subdued. Pacino serves as the film's anchor and much of its success is directly attributable to him. That being said, there are a few standout performances in support, most notably Sean Penn's uncharacteristic portrayal of Carlito's lawyer and close friend, Dave Kleinfeld. Penn got a Golden Globe nomination for his efforts and so did Penelope Ann Miller as the romantic interest, though I found her to be a bit of a weak link. Meanwhile, John Leguizamo stole some scenes in a smaller role and Viggo Mortensen made a memorable appearance as well.As you might expect, de Palma's direction is expertly handled, particularly when it comes to the showstopping chase scene that occurs late in the movie. Although not as flashy as ""Scarface"", there are some nicely executed artistic flourishes from time to time. In fact, the movie has nice production values from top to bottom, so it's a bit surprising that it got a lukewarm critical reception at the time of its release.Despite the movie's initial tepid response it has endured to become a cult classic. It will probably always be overshadowed by ""Scarface"" but it's a worthy gangster movie that's more thoughtful than most of its brethren. I will say, though, that the way the movie starts at (or, rather, near) the end and flashes back seems like it would rob the movie of some of its suspense. In retrospect, I see what the filmmakers had in mind but I wonder what first time viewers will think of it.",Carlito's Way
62,Howlin Wolf,"Enthralling film from De Palma, with just a touch of the 'seen it before's...",8,10 November 2001,"With ""Carlito's Way""; De Palma has crafted the second gangster opus of his career, after '83's (?) ""Scarface"" remake.  Both films introduce us to the minutaie of the life of an immigrant criminal, and the dealings he has with others.  The difference is, in ""Carlito's Way"", said 'gangster' is determined to go straight...   As I said at the start of this review; both films are great and deserve to be seen.  Which is better?  I will always prefer ""Scarface"", because it was made before Pacino REALLY got typecast into playing mobster-types; and the fact is, watching somebody go into a downward spiral makes for better entertainment than watching them try and keep to the straight and narrow does.   In truth though, it's not really the comparisons to its 'cousin' that hurt ""Carlito's Way"", more its similarities to every gangster film made before or since.  Perhaps it's unfair to criticise a movie for having had such a big influence, but despite the best efforts of the cast, what I was watching never felt fresh.  It was even - dare I say it? - slightly predictable.  The best part of the movie for me were the scenes between Pacino and Leguizamo; the latter playing the scuzzball pretender to Carlito's throne.   It was good to see Penn back onscreen again too, but I felt that his role was perhaps hyped up more than it deserved.  The film takes its darn sweet time to get to the crux of the story, and in a way that's good, because we get to know the characters intimately.  However, it also means that the thrust of the movie is somewhat lacking, meaning that it doesn't quite have the intensity of a ""Donnie Brasco"" or a ""Godfather""   All this criticism may give the impression that I don't like the film. Not true.  The problems I've pointed out just serve to highlight how I feel the film could've been made better than it already is.  Even unchanged, it's still miles better than 90% of the stuff you'll see at the cinema today. 
   What you should really take away from my review is this thought: If ""Carlito's Way"" were the first gangster film you had seen, you'd be hailing it as a masterpiece.  It very nearly IS just that, but I felt that it didn't possess the 'hook' to make it legendary.  This is sort of 'Scarface in reverse' then, so if you loved De Palma's earlier effort and feel you want some more of the same, then you're onto a winner.  I love both, but ""Scarface"" has the edge.  Whichever way you look at it, De Palma has now managed to make TWO great gangster films in his career, and some directors can't even manage to make one.  A great film, especially if you get the tape where it's back-to-back with ""Sea of Love"", like I did!",Carlito's Way
63,seymourblack-1,"Violent, Romantic & Very Fatalistic",9,3 November 2017,"Any movie about an ex-con who tries to go straight but comes up against all sorts of obstacles, really has to be good to overcome the natural scepticism of audiences who will justifiably feel that they've seen it all before. Fortunately, there's enough about ""Carlito's Way"" that's original, interesting and enjoyable to prevent it from being seen as too hackneyed, too predictable or too run-of-the-mill and a great deal of the credit for this must be down to the fact that it's based on two books called ""Carlito's Way"" and ""After Hours"" which were both written by Judge Edwin Torres who, no doubt, drew extensively on his experience as a New York State supreme court judge to inject his story with its impressively high level of authenticity.In a New York City courtroom in 1975, Carlito Brigante (Al Pacino), a Puerto Rican drug dealer and alleged assassin, becomes a free man again after having served only 5 years of his 30-year prison sentence. The legal loophole that was exploited to secure his release was spotted by his shady lawyer and best friend David Kleinfeld (Sean Penn). Now feeling older and wiser after having had plenty of time to reflect on his life, Carlito announces to the court that he has been totally rehabilitated and is determined to leave his old criminal life behind and finally go straight.Carlito makes his first mistake when he returns to his old neighbourhood and is persuaded by his young cousin Guajiro (John Ortiz) to accompany him on a routine delivery of some drugs to a local dealer. Their meeting descends into chaos when Guajiro is double-crossed and murdered and after the ensuing shoot-out, Carlito finds himself back on the street but $30,000 richer, after having pocketed some money which had been left unattended after all the shooting had stopped.Carlito promptly uses his newly acquired windfall to buy a partnership in a nightclub with the intention of earning the $75,000 he'd need to fulfil his long-held ambition of taking up an offer he'd had from an old friend to buy a share in his car rental business in the Bahamas. Soon, he starts to make good progress in achieving his goal and things then get even better when he meets up with his ex-girlfriend Gail (Penelope Ann Miller) and they rekindle the relationship which they'd been forced to end when Carlito was imprisoned.An unwelcome development then follows when Kleinfeld is cornered into assisting an Italian mob boss to escape from the Riker's Island prison barge where he's been incarcerated and Carlito feels that he can't refuse when his friend asks for his help. When the escape plan is put into action, the seriously unstable and coked-up Kleinfeld kills both the mob boss and his son and this leads Carlito to decide that if he's ever going to fulfil his dream of going to the Bahamas with Gail and their unborn child, he'll need to do so rapidly because the mob boss' son and his men will inevitably be coming after him with revenge on their minds.Told in flashback with Carlito providing the narration, this gangster movie is consistently tense, violent and very fatalistic but it's also surprisingly romantic. The relationship between Carlito and Gail is beautifully portrayed throughout and a hug that they share soon after reconciling provides an especially warm and powerful expression of their feelings for each other. Similarly, there's another particularly romantic moment at the end of the movie when Carlito, accompanied by the sound of Joe Cocker's ""You Are So Beautiful"", stares wistfully at an illuminated advertisement which features a picture of a Caribbean Island and the slogan ""Escape to Paradise"".Brian De Palma's use of slow motion, black and white and revolving camera-work at various points is both stylish and effective and the extended chase sequence that brings the movie to its climax is brilliantly executed. Commendably, there's also a consistent vibrancy that runs through the whole movie that makes its duration seem significantly shorter than its actual 144 minutes.Al Pacino is marvellous as the ageing gangster whose downfall is ironically sealed by two of his more noble actions when he, through loyalty, agrees to help Kleinfeld and also unwisely shows mercy to another character who doesn't deserve it. Sean Penn is terrific as the corrupt, duplicitous and cocaine-fuelled lawyer who long ago lost sight of the line between what's legal and what isn't and the remaining cast members are also excellent with stand out contributions from Penelope Ann Miller, Luis Guzman and John Leguizamo (as the unforgettable ""Benny Blanco from the Bronx"").",Carlito's Way

65,hnt_dnl,Al Pacino's best film performance post-1990!,10,9 April 2010,"CARLITO'S WAY (1993) is the real best Al Pacino performance after 1990. Love him in his Oscar-winning role in SCENT OF A WOMAN (1992); it's not as overrated as people say and he is infectiously good in that. But in CARLITO'S WAY, Mr. Pacino plays the more difficult role of Carlito Brigante, who deserves as much respect as Michael Corleone or Tony Montana! I've got to preface the rest of my review by saying that I've seen this film a bunch of times, starting with right after it first came out in the early 90s and have loved it ever since. It is one of those films that has EVERYTHING in it that will appeal to anyone. You like Action? CHECK...Romance? CHECK...Drama? CHECK...Thrills? CHECK...Humor? CHECK...This is one of the rare films that has it all!The legendary Pacino seemed to specialize in playing ambitious, crafty, respected gangsters and Carlito is no exception in those general aspects; but in this film, Carlito is in large parts different from both Corleone or Montana; whereas both Corleone and Montana were very powerful men that controlled empire throughout the bulk of their films, Carlito WAS a powerful gangster who lost his empire and did jail time; also, Corleone and Montana were inherently suspicious and possessive men to the point of being paranoid, and dare I say it, inherently evil; whereas Carlito was justifiably suspicious, but also ironically forgiving and accepting of other people's shortcomings and at his core, a GOOD man! The other 2 men chose to live a certain way and either never tried to redeem himself (Corleone) or never had a chance (Montana), but Carlito has lived the hard, gangster lifestyle, paid for his sins, and now wants redemption and to start anew. From the moment the film starts in 1975 with his courtroom speech (the only pure comic moment in the film) ""thanking"" the judge for releasing him early from his 30-year prison sentence (he only served 5 years) to the very end, the viewer HAS to root for Carlito Brigante! Carlito, upon release, wants to start a whole knew life and become legitimate. No more drug-dealing, no more killings. He wants to play it straight. Carlito's lawyer that gets him off is Dave Kleinfeld (played by the great Sean Penn in a superb performance), a shady man who is hooked on drugs and has his own troubles as he has stolen money from one of his other imprisoned gangster clients, who finds out about it and blackmails Kleinfeld into helping break him out of prison. This is definitely one of my favorite Sean Penn performances and ironically in a supporting role. He's effortless as this scuzzy, posing, pathetic, out-of-his-league lawyer and in a way, his tale is as tragic as Carlito's.The film's first ironic moment occurs when Carlito's young cousin gets him into a scrape with some low-level drug dealers in a crappy gin-joint/pool hall, where Carlito must use his old school cunning and instincts to survive. His cousin had $30,000 to make the deal for the drugs, but the dealers were going to kill him and keep the drugs and money for themselves. Carlito can't save his inexperienced cousin, but outsmarts the dealers and gets away with the money. He uses that money to buy into a partnership with disco-owner Sasso. At this point, he sees a dancer one night that reminds him of his old girlfriend Gail (Penelope Ann Miller in a sexy, sweet performance). He seeks out Gail one night after her dance class and they go to a diner to talk about their past and possible future. Honestly, I think that ""beauty"" is an overrated word and there are even actresses that are (supposedly) beautiful in real life that don't do it for me on screen, but Miller as Gail totally does it for me! Gail is a REAL woman, who, like Carlito has goals, ambitions, desires and they complement each other perfectly. Gail is sexy in a very natural way.Things look good for Carlito, but feeling he must help Dave out of his scrape, he goes along with him the night of the prison escape on a boat with the gangster's son and Dave kills the son against Carlito's wishes. Carlito cleans his hands of Dave. But there is another up and coming gangster Benny Blanco (John Leguiziamo in a wonderful performance) that has an unhealthy admiration for Carlito and won't leave him alone. So Carlito finds himself surrounded by all these shady types that he can't shake. He decides to run away with Gail, who is pregnant.Directed by the great Brian DePalma, CARLITO'S WAY is a very authentic period piece as he captures the essence of the 1970s without the film bogging itself down in that time period. The focus is on the characters and the story, but has an epic feel with a lot of long-view tracking shots, an operatic score, and Pacino's brilliant narration of his characters thoughts and emotions. The cinematography is amongst the best I've ever seen in a modern film. All these elements perfectly complement the bombastic personality, yet contemplative nature of Carlito Brigante. I don't know if I've ever seen a film where virtually all non-human elements of the film reminded TOTALLY of it's main character! Another thing...this film is almost 2 and 1/2 hours long and is NEVER boring! That's an incredible feat in and of itself.Great supporting work is also provided by Luis Guzman (as Carlito's right hand man Pachanga), James Rebhorn (as the D.A. out to nail Kleinfeld), Paul Mazursky (as the judge who freed Carlito), and my favorite one played by Viggo Mortensen (as the wheelchair-bound Lalin, an old associate of Carlito's).But in the end, this film is ALL Mr. Pacino's, who effortlessly essays the title character and gets some of the most quotable dialogue in the gangster genre of film. A top 10 film of the 1990s!",Carlito's Way

67,TOMASBBloodhound,Showing us the ending at the beginning didn't help.,6,18 June 2006,"Maybe with Brian De Palma directing Al Pacino once again, my expectations were too high. Carlito's Way is not a bad film. It's filled with many memorable scenes and characters, but ultimately it just can't pull them all together.Al Pacino plays Carlito Brigante. He's a mid-level Puerto Rican crime lord who has just been released from jail after serving only five years of a thirty-year sentence. Apparently a technicality and Carlito's brilliantly slimy lawyer (Sean Penn) have set him free early. Carlito sets out to raise $75,000 and move to Jamaica so he can buy his way into the car rental business. Yes, he plans on going legit. His slimy lawyer basically laughs in his face when he hears Carlito's plan. How can a man with such a violent past ever go legit, asks the conventional wisdom on the street. Carlito isn't out of jail more than a day or two before he's already involved in a violent shoot out and running a seedy nightclub for the money he needs. He tries his hardest, but it's no use. Not only does he have trouble avoiding his violent tendencies, but he's surrounded by thugs and low-life's (his lawyer in particular) that constantly bring him down. He hooks up with an old flame and asks her to come with him when he leaves the city. Of course she says yes, but with everyone after Carlito by the end of the film, will they make it out of New York alive? Unfortunately, that question is answered in the first five minutes of this film. Why the hell did they do this? Well, sometimes that technique works. Casino and Fight Club come to mind. But here.... I don't like it. That conclusion would have been a hell of a lot more convincing had we not seen it happen so soon. The film plays itself out fairly well to get us back to what we've already seen, but I just wish the film could have started out in the courtroom.Pacino is good, but not great. His accent needed a little work, and it comes and goes. Of course, he is talented enough to make any performance more than watchable. I'll lay it right on the line... Sean Penn walks away with this film. His scumbag lawyer character is one of the most unsavory creeps I've seen in a film in a long time. Penn's character is the embodiment of nearly everything that can be wrong with a person. He seems to revel in his character's sleaziness. Most of supporting actors are also very good. John Leguizamo shows definite promise in one of his earliest roles.Overall, it just wasn't as good as I'd hoped. The film shoots itself in the foot by showing the ending at the beginning. And also, there are way too many references to other De Palma films in this one. It's like every ten minutes he has to remind you of all the other films he's done.6 of 10 stars.The Hound.",Carlito's Way

Unfortunately his old associates don't want this to happen and Carlito is in a race against time to get away before his luck runs out. To complicate matters he rekindles an old romance with Gail who (wrongly) never really believes he can go straight. His bent lawyer oversteps the mark with someone and Carlito is in real trouble.

69,ajs-10,Another great Pacino performance...,8,11 December 2010,"I remember seeing parts of this film back in the nineties, but I think this is the first time I've seen it all the way through. This is a very decent gangster movie; I was impressed with both the performances of the main cast and the production. But more of that later, here's a short summary first (summary haters please wait in the car with Pachanga; we got some business to attend to) Carlito Brigante has just got out of jail on a technicality. He was supposed to go down for thirty years, but thanks to the hard work of his lawyer, David Kleinfeld, he gets out in five. He vows that he will not return to his life of crime and intends to go straight from now on. This, as we discover, proves a little harder than Carlito at first thinks. Things have changed a lot on the streets in the five years he's been inside, but there are still some of his old associates about. Carlito has a plan, a plan that depends on him getting his hands on $75,000. The trouble is there are not very many legitimate ways to get your hands on that kind of cash. David Kleinfeld sets him up with a job, running a night club that he has a stake in and, at first, things seem to be running OK. He re-kindles the relationship with his ex-girlfriend, Gail, a dancer, and she is keen for him to go straight also. But then he is slowly dragged back into the world he is trying to escape by David and the colourful company he has dealings with. I will leave my summary there; don't want to give too much away.Although I found it a little long, I did enjoy this film. For the most part it is engaging and it is sometimes slightly unpredictable. Great cinematography and I thought the use of music was also very well done. Great performances from Al Pacino as Carlito 'Charlie' Brigante, Sean Penn as David Kleinfeld and Penelope Ann Miller as Gail. Honourable mentions must also go to, John Leguizamo as Benny Blanco, Ingrid Rogers as Steffie, Luis Guzmán as Pachanga and Viggo Mortensen as Lalin.As I've already said, I felt this film was a little too long. I also felt that a little too much was made of the love story between Carlito and Gail. I think that Pacino maybe isn't as convincing on screen as a romantic lead. But having said that, the love story does have its place at the send of the day. Quite an enjoyable film over all with some great performances Recommended.My score: 7.9/10",Carlito's Way

73,dave13-1,I liked this one a lot better than Scarface,8,13 April 2012,"As a cinematic walk on the wild side of crime and drugs, Carlito's Way is both entertaining and challenging. The presence of Pacino make comparisons to Scarface inevitable, and Carlito's Way could actually be a kind of sequel, assuming Pacino got nabbed at the end of Scarface, got out after five years thanks to a technicality and decided to go straight. His hood friends and sleaze bag lawyer, however, make sure he gets sucked back into a life of not just crime but criminal intrigue, complete with double-crossing and murder. Scarface had a certain macho appeal to everything, but I always liked this one better. It's a more hard-boiled crime thriller, and less superficially pretty in its production design and cinematography. The criminal scheming has a greater complexity to it, and the mobster characters seem more desperate and closer to the edge. Scarface was played out in the big money high stakes world of the cocaine trade, but here the possibility of death by double cross seems to hang on the heels of everybody much more. Sean Penn's lawyer character, like any good movie villain, seems capable of anything, and drives the action by weaving schemes around one character and then another and having them double cross each other. This makes for an interestingly plotted movie as we follow one scheme after another, each trickier and more desperate than the last, some succeeding, others falling apart. The question is not whether it will all come down at the end, but rather who will manage to dodge the fallout.",Carlito's Way

Brian De Palma (Scarface and The Untouchables), directs another successful film that has colorful characters, a good soundtrack, and a good screenplay by David Koepp. The performances were good especially by Al Pacino (who performs with another accent like in Scarface), Penelope Ann Miller, John Lequizamo, and Luis Guzman. I didn't think that Sean Penn was that great in this film. I thought he tried too hard and I sort of thought he did the part pretty badly honestly. Don't get me wrong, I like Sean Penn a lot, but I just thought he played a dull performance. Overall, this is a good film by Brian DePalma, that will be appreciated more and more in the future.

76,oOoBarracuda,Carlito's Way,10,17 February 2017,"I feel like I need to personally write an apology to Al Pacino. I've been labeling him as a mediocre actor for years, obviously without seeing his best roles. After watching Dog Day Afternoon last year, I was blown away by his performance, but thought it may be the only standout in his career. After seeing Carlito's Way, however, I can say without question that, at the very least, he had two career performances. The 1993 film directed by Brian De Palma was a brilliant film exploring the life of a former Puerto Rican convict pledging to stay on the straight and narrow. Starring Al Pacino in a brilliantly acted role, along with Sean Penn, and Penelope Ann Miller, Carlito's Way was an artful representation of the wide-reaching impact the mafia has on those inside it, and just how hard it is to leave that lifestyle.Pledging to stay on the right path after his release from prison, a release due to a legal technicality obtained by his less than ethical lawyer, David Kleinfeld (Sean Penn) Carlito(Al Pacino) vows to stop selling drugs and make a living in a more honest way. In hopes to leave his trafficking ways behind, Carlito takes over a nightclub in hopes to raise enough money to leave New York and the mob scene behind. Along the way, Carlito is tempted to return to his ways and encounters mobsters out to get him at almost every turn. When Carlito resumes a relationship with Gail, (Penelope Ann Miller) the dancer he fell in love with before he went to prison, he is more determined than ever to live an honest life, perhaps even settling down in marriage and fatherhood. When he learns that his lawyer and friend, David has gotten himself into trouble with the Italian mob, he feels it is his duty to help him, no matter the cost. Helping David, however, ends up getting Carlito into more trouble than he may be able to escape.I experienced a fair bit of amazement upon finishing Carlito's Way. Having not experienced many De Palma films, I was in awe of aspects that are probably typical for the director. For instance, the entire film is gorgeously shot. De Palma's use of color is brilliant, beautifully encapsulating the vibrant energy of Carlito's environment. The camera work was mesmerizing; De Palma shows his mastery through brilliant low-angle shots, effective bird's-eye view shots, some of the most masterful tracking shots I have ever seen, and pans and overlays like a genius. Carlito's Way is an example of the unique way that film truly is moving art on-screen. The performances De Palma was able to pull from his principles help cement the film in one of the most formulaic genres. I never thought I would buy AL Pacino as a Puerto Rican, nor anything other than Italian, but his nuanced performance with enough unique idiosyncracies will have anyone buying his portrayal hook, line, and sinker. Sean Penn is also brilliant in a role that requires an equal mix of evil and naivety, something difficult to imagine Penn pulling off. Narration can go one of two ways in a film, but in Carlito's Way, the titular Carlito narrating much of his life was absolutely perfect. One of the best aspects of the film was the chase scene taking up the last 20 minutes or so of the film. The fact that De Palma chose to do a dramatic chase scene done on foot was sensational. Car chases, boat chases, train chases, even motorcycle chases have all been done before, but to film a chase scene that takes place on foot, proving tension can still be established in an underused way proves De Palma's mastery as a director, and one that I now vow to use more of his work. A true standout in the genre, Carlito's Way is truly a gut-wrenching watch, full of suspense and brilliant story telling more than worthy of a viewing.",Carlito's Way
77,FilmFanInTheHouse,Superb,9,19 February 2009,"Carlito's Way (1993, Dir. Brian De Palma) Finally released from prison, Carlito Brigante (Pacino) has vowed that he will not go back to the life he once had. His move to a new life isn't easy, as Carlito must resist every taunt and every opportunity back into his old lifestyle. He meets up with his old love, Gail (Ann Miller) who shows him the person he can be in a happy life, but his good friend and lawyer, David Kleinfeld (Penn) is having problems of his own and would love the help he could gain from the legend known as Carlito.Superb crime thriller which places Pacino further as one of the masters of this genre. The supporting cast, with a wonderful turn by Sean Penn, and the well written script keeps you hooked into the very end, with the want for more.There I am, sitting in jail, wondering where you are, what you're doing, who you're with.  Carlito (Al Pacino)",Carlito's Way
78,richieandsam,A very good film... one of Pacinos best.,7,26 June 2013,"CARLITO'S WAYI thought this was really good.The movie is about an ex con who gets released from prison and is determined to go straight. He is not interested in crime anymore. The problem is, he has got such a big reputation, that all the gangsters and criminals find him for advice, deals and help... some even want to kill him.The film stars Al Pacino, Sean Penn, Penelope Ann Miller, John Leguizamo, Ingrid Rogers & Luis Guzman.Everyone did a great job. Al is an amazing actor. He is over the top in some of his movies and there are scenes in this film where he is over the top too, but his performances always brings intensity. He is such an intense person and he can be a very scary person. But i think he is great! Sean Penn plays his lawyer... and at the beginning of the movie I felt he was a geek. Big curly hair, geeky glasses and he looks like he doesn't belong in the company of these gangsters... but as the film goes on he changes. The pressures of life gets to him and he can't handle it. His character has a hard time and i felt sorry for him towards the end of the film.I loved the action sequences. The gun fights and make-up were great. There was one scene where a guy gets shot in the face, it was so well shot. The way it was filmed made it look so real.It was a good crime drama/thriller... and I was pleasantly surprised at how good it is.I will give this film 7 out of 10.Al Pacino knows how to play a great gangster... and you can't help but feel sorry for him in this film because all he wants it to get out, but no matter what he does he just gets dragged back in.For more reviews, please like my Facebook page:https://www.facebook.com/pages/Ordinary-Person-Movie- Reviews/456572047728204?ref=hl",Carlito's Way

80,MovieCriticOnline,You really have to overlook a lot of stuff to like this,3,25 February 2020,"It was so poorly written and executed. I could spend hours writing about everything wrong with it. The music was all over the place. It's like they didn't look a the year the songs were released, they just added them randomly irrespective of the release dates.Then you had the phony Hollywood gangster stereotypes. One of De Palma's worst movies. Pacino's character was so smart he could spot trouble miles away but couldn't see any of Sean Penn's character's problems.Then Leguizamo was totally miscast as the bad guy and so was Viggo. Al Pacino as Puerto Rican? This was a part that he didn't need to do. He already done Scarface so there was no real reason to do another one.It was almost offensive how bas these caricatures were. I didn't believe 90% of the dialogue. I didn't like it the first time I saw it, and after revisiting it several times it gets worse.The whole movie Pacino says he is out of the crime business but he keeps getting involved. That was the movie.",Carlito's Way
81,rooee,De Palma at the top of his game,7,12 April 2010,"Based on novels by Edwin Torres, this heartfelt gangster flick makes for a fine sequel to Scarface - or at the very least a very welcome revisiting for Al Pacino and director Brian de Palma.David Koepp's script paints a picture of a mean New York, full of thuggish opportunists and snivelling cowards (Viggo Mortensen's slimy Lalin is a must-see for all Lord of the Rings fans wishing to see that actor's range). And at the centre of it all is Pacino's Puerto Rican Carlito: relocated, reinvigorated; reborn and going straight... or so he hopes.There's something undeniably tragic about Carlito's plight. It provides a lovely narrative goal; while lawyer and best friend David Kleinfeld (Sean Penn) wilfully digs his way into a violent criminal world, Carlito wants out - and he wants to bring his stripper girlfriend Gail (a miscast Penelope Ann Miller) with him. Oliver Stone's wickedly cynical script for Scarface described a conceited monster; it's easier to warm to this redeemed version: still artful and egotistic, and yet blessed - or, as it happens, cursed - with a shrouded sense of morality.The representation of the relationship between Carlito and Gail is mawkish, but it's worth remembering that this is a portrait of broad strokes. De Palma has never been a stranger to melodrama - in fact, he fairly relishes it. Here he draws a memorable performance from Sean Penn, while his framing and movement are as dynamic and assured as ever. The pace is pulsating; Pacino's anti-hero is effortlessly sharp and angry; Patrick Doyle's music is aptly melodramatic; and the final burst for freedom - an expertly-staged, fifteen minute foot chase sequence - is pure cinema.",Carlito's Way
82,DavidYZ,Very good crime film,9,21 April 2017,This is an excellent film about a middle-aged Puerto Rican ex-convict who's drawn back into violent crime in New York City soon after being released from prison.

84,eagandersongil,"Relationships of love, and crime",8,12 August 2017,"Brian De Palma has a unique tone for his mafia films, and ""Carlitos Way"" is no different, with a suspense characteristic of a thriller alienated to a good script and good pace, Brian was already an experienced guy had already directed His greatest classics when he took over the direction of this Longa, and you can see his touch and tone in the film. We have a script that tells the ending, and then shows the story, is an interesting resource, and is applied wrapped in many techniques, such as the mixture of PB with color, the camera ripple and the narration, is a moment almost the part of Of the film, after this moment we see in fact the trajectory of Carlito 'Charlie' Brigante (Al Pacino), the gangster who is taken out of jail, back in the streets, and all he wants is redemption and live the rest of his life away from Streets with his beloved, but ends up wrapped in the problems of his friend and lawyer David Kleinfeld (Sean Penn). ""Carlitos Way"" is a film that talks about redemption, Carlitos really is trying to change and believes that he can change, until he reaches the point where he accepts his destiny, it is a lyrical love story that has as background the Mafia, Murders, traffic and crimes, we see the love of friendship, loyalty and the special person, and how the relationship between them works, is an interesting and very well-adapted story. Even often using ex-machine features, Brian holds and strings his script convincingly giving Carlito a look of a Tony Montana mixed to Eliot Ness. Brian de Palm is a very accurate guy in the technique of his films, he knows how to work the camera very well, and here it is no different, he makes the viewer a compliment, we have a little camera used in tripod, that walks, Zoom, opens the frame and especially, is always in the right place in moments of tension, even some plans of the film are very simple, in the directional aspect, Brian does not miss, the movie sometimes reminds the great ""Scarface"", perhaps the scenes Of nightclub, but the photograph, she is different, she is gray and more suburban, aligned to a punctual trail that always pulls to a suspense. Al Pacino and his beard fill the screen always, even if his acting is not brilliant, Al Pacino has a masterful grandeur, it is impossible to take his eyes off him and not feel intimate for his character, Sean Penn is also very well in his moments, First a centered lawyer and then a mobster who hates gangsters, Penelope Ann and her almost angelic beauty is also wonderful, and contrasts even physically with Carlito's character making the viewer cling more to the couple in that air of ""Forbidden Love."" ""Carlitos Way"" is among the best works of Brian De Palma for his subtlety and because he can keep a footprint and lead to the end without making the film coarse or boring.",Carlito's Way

The latter half or so is an action packed delight featuring tightly woven suspense segments, awesome memorable direction, acting, writing and cinematography. Unfortunately the development sequences more often then not show both DePalma and Pacino tripping over themselves in an embarrassing fun house mirror reflection of their classic Scarface. Pacino at times is a laughable caricature as Carlito, who among other things cant nail down which accent he likes best, John Milton, Tony Montana, or Michael Corleone. His acting is unbridled hammism at its worst, but even worse is the film itself. The beginning development scenes are either cringe bad, downright boring or both. But hang in there, because it morphs into well above average fare once it finally finds itself long about the 4th reel.",Carlito's Way
86,jcbutthead86,"An Excellent And Stylish Gangster Classic. Brian De Palma,Al Pacino And Sean Penn At Their Best.",10,21 November 2013,"Carlito's Way is an Excellent and stylish Gangster classic that is filled with great direction,amazing acting,a wonderful script and a fantastic score and soundtrack. All of those combinations make Carlito's Way one of the greatest Gangster Films ever made and is Brian De Palma,Al Pacino and Sean Penn at their best.Based on the novels Carlito's Way and After Hours by Edwin Torres and set in New York City in 1975,Carlito's Way tells the story Carlito Brigante,(Al Pacino)a former drug dealer who after five years in prison has been released. While out of prison,Carlito wants to go straight and get out of the business and rekindle a relationship with his former girlfriend Gale(Penelope Ann Miller). But Carlito's efforts to go straight are interrupted when corrupt lawyer and friend Dave Kleinfeld(Sean Penn)as well as other associates and enemies who are trying bring Carlito back into his criminal lifestyle. Will Carlito keep trying to go straight and start a new life or go back to his old criminal life?Released in 1993,Carlito's Way did decent business at the Box Office but surprising received a lukewarm to mixed reception by film critics some of the criticisms was that Carlito's Way was too similar to the other Brian De Palma-Al Pacino Gangster classic Scarface. But overtime Carlito's Way gained a Cult Following thanks to Home Video and many television showings and is now seen as a one of the best Gangster films of all time and the praise is well deserved. Carlito's Way is Gangster classic that is amazing from beginning to end because while the storyline of Carlito's Way has been done before(i.e ex-convict trying to go straight)director Brian De Palma and Al Pacino bring something unique and creative to the film giving viewers a movie that is stylish and powerful,dark and tragic,romantic and beautiful as well as intense and thrilling. CW is a Film that is also rooted in the style and tradition of Film Noir with the gangsters,criminals and thugs are vicious and follow the rules and codes of the streets and the tone of the movie is gritty and dark. CW is also a Film Noir with the narration of the main character Carlito because with the narration we as the viewer are pulled into Carlito's mind and thoughts which are done almost like quiet whispers that are haunting and talks about the past and the present. While Carlito's Way is a Gangster film,De Palma has time to put in a few exciting and thrilling Action and Suspense sequences. De Palma knows how to film Action,suspense and thrills and De Palma is at the top of his game with CW because with each Action scene there is a great build up and a satisfying payoff and with Action scene there is attention to detail as well as amazing timing. The most memorable and explosive Action scene is the train station chase sequence which is directed like an Alfred Hitchcock scene and will also remind viewers of De Palma's classic train station scene in The Untouchables and if you loved the train station scene in The Untouchables you will the train station scene in this film. The character Carlito Brigante is great character because he is complex and has great depth and you will relate to him in wanting to go straight despite all of the things going on around him and we as the viewers are rooting for him to succeed and start a new life. While wanting to go straight Carlito still follows the rules of the streets but Carlito also follows his own rules and as you watch Carlito's Way you will see Carlito make great attempts to stay out of his old criminal life and while some of his friends and associates are trying make him go back to his old ways which makes Carlito sympathetic and tragic. The screenplay by David Koepp is fantastic and memorable,with Koepp giving the characters dialog that is gritty and tough matching the tone of the film. The ending of Carlito's Way is amazing.powerful and sad but it adds to the greatness and tragic feel of the movie. A powerful ending.The whole cast is great. Al Pacino is excellent and at his best as Carlito,with Pacino bringing grittiness,depth and intensity to the role. Sean Penn is brilliant as Kleinfeld,Carlito's friend and lawyer with. Penelope Ann Miller is terrific and beautiful as Gale,Carlito's girlfriend and love interest. John Leguizamo is fantastic as Benny Blanco,a hood from the Bronx. Ingrid Rogers is wonderful and sexy as Steffie,a club girl. Luis Guzman is outstanding as Pachanga,an old associate of Carlito's. Viggo Mortensen is great as Lalin,an old friend of Carlito's.The direction by Brian De Palma is brilliant and stylish,with De Palma always moving the camera bringing his usual visual style and tone to the film with zooms,close-ups with tracking and over head shots. Great direction,De Palma.The score by Patrick Doyle is amazing,powerful,tragic and intense matching every important scene in the movie. Terrific score,Doyle. The film also has a great soundtrack with songs by The Bee Gees(You Should Be Dancing),The O'Jays(I Love Music,Back Stabbers),KC & The Sunshine Band(Shake Shake Shake)Shake Your Booty,That's The Way(I Like It),LaBelle(Lady Marmalade),Joe Cocker(You Are So Beautiful),The Hues Corporation(Rock The Boat),Cheryl Lynn(Got To Be Real),Santana(Oye Como Va),Ed Terry(Disco Inferno,Rock Your Baby), and more. In final word,if you love Gangster Films,Crime Dramas,Brian De Palma,Al Pacino,Sean Penn or films in general,I highly suggest you see Carlito's Way.an excellent and stylish Gangster classic that is Brian De Palma,Al Pacino and Sean Penn at their best. Highly Recommended. 10/10.",Carlito's Way
87,random_avenger,Carlito's Way,7,16 August 2010,"New York, 1975: A Puerto Rican criminal Carlito Brigante (Al Pacino) is released from prison due to a technicality and announces his plans of going straight and leaving his old gangster life behind. Easier said than done: in his job of managing a night club there are plenty of old friends and enemies trying to pull him back into the shady side of life, and especially Carlito's long-time lawyer and friend David Kleinfeld (Sean Penn) proves out to be dangerously unpredictable in the maze of temptations known as the nightlife of 1970s New York. Luckily Carlito's girlfriend Gail (Penelope Ann Miller) is there to support him, even if she's unhappy about the hazards in his life.Director De Palma does a good job at portraying Carlito's world. The colourful lighting in the nightclubs, the long takes, tracking shots and Dutch angles are skilfully used and only occasionally become distracting from the story. Especially the final chase scenes in the subway and train station are also excitingly presented, even though the main focus of the film is not on action.The actors are generally good, especially the bearded Pacino in the lead role, but Sean Penn is convincing as the weasely lawyer Kleinfeld as well. The presence of Pacino also leads thoughts to the 1983 De Palma classic Scarface, as both deal with Hispanic figures in the American underworld and are quite lengthy and unhurried, even if the later film ultimately contents itself with a less epic style and Carlito Brigante is a much calmer character than Tony Montana. In short, Carlito's Way succeeds fairly well in bringing life to its characters and the technical direction is enjoyable to follow, so every crime film fan ought to give it a go – De Palma fans won't be disappointed either.",Carlito's Way
88,barberoux,Racist,4,14 July 2003,I thought `Carlito's Way' was a distasteful movie.  The movie portrayed Latinos as criminals and dopers.  The other main character was a dishonest Jewish lawyer.  Even though Carlito was surrounded by Latino beauties he lusts after a skinny white women with a Hampton Hairdo.  The white women couldn't have an affair with a Latino unless he forced himself on her as represented scene with the chain on her apartment door.  Of course you had to have some Italian mafia types to round out the stereotypes.  Overall this was a horrible movie and an insult to all involved.,Carlito's Way
89,The_Core,"Not flawless, but great, great filmmaking",9,10 November 2000,"***SPOILERS***   ***SPOILERS*** ""Carlito's Way"" is a work of incredible filmmaking.  It is not without its flaws... as has been stated, Penelope Ann Miller's acting skills are not the best in the world, and a few lines seemed a bit out of place to me, such as right at the end in the voice-over when Carlito says ""Gail's gonna make a good mom.""  That didn't seem to fit the situation too well and sounded a bit corny to me, but no screenplay is perfect (American Beauty comes durned close, but that's another story).The sheer realism depicted in this film is enough to recommend it.  Sean Penn gives the most brilliant performance of his career, in my opinion, and Pacino makes the Carlito character come to sparkling life (although he should have worked a bit more on the spanish accent -- he slips a few times and doesn't quite sound like a native, especially in the few lines where he actually speaks spanish).But these are minor quibbles.  ""Carlito's Way"" gets better every time I see it, and that's enough to put the movie in my top ten list of favorites (I've seen hundreds and hundreds of films).  ""Casino"" is excellent but too depressing to watch very often, ""Goodfellas"" is also excellent but is not repeatedly viewable like ""Carlito's Way.""  Scenes like the one where Carlito is standing in the rain with a garbage can lid watching Gail dance, and the entire sequence towards the beginning when his cousin gets killed in a drug deal gone wrong, are just unforgettable.  This movie is full of such unforgettable screen-burning scenes and brilliant lines.  It's truly a feast for the eyes, ears and mind.If you haven't seen ""Carlito's Way"" yet and you appreciate the ""neo-gangster"" genre, you're missing out big time.  If possible, see it on a big-screen TV, in the DVD format.  The final scene where the ""Paradise"" poster comes alive and then fades to purple is just so moving, the colour needs to fill a whole room and reflect off all the windows and walls.  The perfect closure to a true work of art.9/10.",Carlito's Way
90,tnrcooper,One of the worst haircuts ever seen on film,8,26 September 2004,"This film gives more ammo to critics of lawyers, that's for sure. Sean Penn plays a lawyer so crooked, lawyers may actually be offended at their depiction. Lawyers may actually be ashamed, if that's possible. I remember this film coming out and didn't remember how well regarded it was. But I really enjoyed it. Plot is not too revolutionary...just the story of a local drug pusher named Carlito (Pacino) recently released from jail and trying to keep to the straight and narrow. However, some don't wish to leave Carlito free and safe on the sidelines, including a lawyer named David Kleinfeld (Penn). Kleinfeld has Carlito in his debt and it is through his convoluted entanglements that Carlito is pulled back into the fringes of crime. Pacino's accent conjures up memories of his turn in ""Scarface"" as a Cuban hood, and it does sound vaguely pimp-ish. Nevertheless, as acting goes, Pacino is solid without edging into self-parody and Penn adds another notch to his belt of roles he can play. The perm notwithstanding, he is superb in the film, and, while I'm not sure if he received an Oscar nomination for this role, I think he may well have deserved one. He plays an insecure, homicidal, drugged-up lawyer. Penn manages to capture the real danger that this man, as insecure as he is (and who wouldn't be, really, with that perm?), poses to those with whom he clashes?",Carlito's Way

Sean Penn's depiction of an absolute twit is astounding. This guy can play anyone. All featured roles are great.

92,mattiasflgrtll6,The best of Al Pacino.,10,13 October 2015,"Carlito after spending several years in jail finally gets out and decides to never get involved with the mafia again. And it's not only because of legal reasons, but moral too. He wants to start over, become a better person. That proves not to be so easy, as he already starts to fail on the first day...Holy. S'hit. This movie is a f'ucking masterpiece. Rarely have I before seen such a heartbreakingly honest and involving movie or gotten so infatuated with a character that I got completely lost into the movie so much that it felt like real life. The dialogue is a fantastic mix of philosophy, heart and even a little tint of humor. Al Pacino and Sean Penn are both so incredible in their roles that it's hard to decide who's the better of them. The music is tremendous. And of course, how can I do this review without mentioning Brian De Palma's directing? There are lots of creative camera angles and the action (when it happens) is more intense than I've seen in any other movie. Gorgeous is what it is.Carlito is an ex-gangster who just wants to do the right thing at the same time as he finds it hard to fight against his gangster instincts and can snap anytime. Kleinfeld is a lawyer who used to live the perfect life but quickly screws it up more and more. And... he's nuts. He's out of his mind! Which means it's a perfect role for Penn, doesn't it?The love story between Carlito and Gail is beautiful and doesn't feel the least bit unnatural. The scenes between the two are very humane and among the more romantic parts of the movie. The chemistry is astonishing! Al Pacino and Penelope Anne Miller make for a wonderful screen couple.What really breaks this apart from all the other gangster flicks is its story. Where else do you find one where the main character doesn't want to be a gangster and enjoy the high life, but actually get out of the hellhole that it is? Carlito is unusually enough not somebody you think is cool but know is an asshole. He's somebody who regret his evil ways and wants to be a good person once and for all, THAT makes him cool.I was horrified and cried when it got to the ending! Oh man, this is such a feel-bad movie it's not even funny.If you love Scarface and Brian De Palma, you've GOT to see this!",Carlito's Way

Set in 1975 Carlito Brigante(Al Pacino)is a former drug baron(Of course he is, he is Tony Montana, Scarface) trying to go straight after a long spell in jail, but his crooked lawyer(Sean Penn) has other plans for him. As inevitable as Greek tragedy, but Pacino and Penn are bpth spellbinding. Carlito guides us through the film as narrator of what is going on as though we are reading his diary. And let us not forget that there is a beautiful love story in here too. This film has a great script and a great pace to it, but im not too fond of the chase towards the end of the film.",Carlito's Way
94,JaydoDre,"The mood feels off, but a well put together film otherwise.",7,19 November 2014,"When Al Pacino played a certain other Southern gentleman in the movie Scarface, I believed he was from Cuba. In this movie he is supposed to be a Puerto Rican gangster, but frankly, what I see is an older white man who's trying to walk cool and he only looks whiter because of the black clothing and dark glasses he is wearing.The believability of characters suffers overall due to their actions and the mood that this movie picks. Al Pacino's character for example is charming to the max and never does anything evil or at least undeserved...for someone who is supposedly a hardened criminal. His love interest, and by extension their relationship, is not very believable. Not because they do not have chemistry, they do, but the story is such that she should hate him or at the very least have a very complicated attitude but instead it plays out like a fairytale.At one point in this movie during a heartfelt moment I started hearing high pitched touches on a piano, the kind of music you would hear in a romantic comedy.This light mood is strange because at times there is some pretty violent stuff happening.One of the best things about this movie, though it takes a while to pay off, is Sean Penn as the shady lawyer. This guy has some range. Seeing him as this nervous slithering pair of round glasses with curly hair is amazing, considering the other roles he has played.The storyline is largely transparent. A criminal is trying to retire and that does not want to work. It's another gangster movie.But it is an entertaining gangster movie. It flows well. It has a style it is sticking with. It is well shot. It is like a shiny 80s blues or jazz record. It is a bright gangster movie if there is such a thing and it grows on you towards the end.",Carlito's Way

Also, i really like Sean Penn, he had a supporting role in the movie too, and the combination of him and Al Pacino seemed fitting for this movie. It may be underrated, because it gets compared to Scarface a lot, Scarface is very different, since the story of Carlito's way is like an upside down plot of Scarface, in Scarface Tony Montana wants to be the greatest drug dealer in the world, here Carlito wants to completely cut himself out of the business and live a normal, happy life with his beloved woman. But as they say - you are married to the game. Once you are in, you are never getting out.Has some of the classic gangster/ crime movie gags, maybe with less violence, shows you that nobody can be trusted once it comes to business, money over everything etc. Nonetheless, if you like Al Pacino, this is a must watch, not saying it is his best performance ever, but it is decent enough!",Carlito's Way

98,matija-trost,A CLASSIC AND ONE OF THE BEST...,9,25 March 2002,"...among the gangster movies.  You could compare it with a legends such as Scarface, Goodfellas, Casino. It may not be such a huge movie, but it got something else. A vivid love story. On one side a tough gangster and on the other side a fragile, yet a strong beauty. The question is: Could he make it...all the way to the happy end?Or a better question: Is it possible to make a gangster movie with a happy end?  The biggest credit in this movie goes to Al Pacino, who was after Scarface, once more brilliant. I can't imagine anyone else who could do his role. And beside him, there was talented and beautiful Penelope Ann Miller, who was also the perfect pick. All in all, there isn't any bad acting in this movie...especially the Italian and Mexican gangsters were convincing.
 Carlito's Way remains one of my top 10 choices. Why? Great acting, (before mentioned) love story, tense action, great scenography (70's style), strong characters, good music, and something undescribable. Something, that made me watch this movie about 7 times, since it was released. And I never got bored.A strong 9 out of 10",Carlito's Way
99,RickHarvey,Carlito's way,7,9 December 2010,"Brian De palma has both style and substance in his films. Undertones of scarface are buried under the surface in carlito's way. But to state that both are similar is idiotic. Tony was a rag to riches story while carlito stands on the complete opposite of the pole. Carlito a big timer, a figure who is known and after serving five years in prison, he wants to leave his past behind and to locate himself in a new location, away from all the crime. That the plot and being 145 minutes long, it good to enough to keep you hooked from start to finish.Al pacino does his typical gangster role but seeing that he delivers every time (past couple of years he been of his game )i have no problem seeing him act out the role. A huge amount of credit goes to him. While his past is kept secret, you know carlito has done so pretty bad things in his life, you know he used to be cold blooded killer not so long ago. but despite all this, you can't help but like him.I had mix feeling on the soundtrack. The club scenes, very familiar with Scarface, jointed well the songs but my worst gripe with it was during the Love scene. For a gangster film, i thought it was too corny.Another problem was with the final act. Nothing wrong with the cat and mouse scene, that was brilliant but it the fact that we all knew what was coming which ruined somewhat of the suspense for me. Plus, not to mention the predictable ending, in which, it was easy to know who was going to do it.Apart from that, this is a overall strong gangster film with fantastic acting. No doubt Al pacino made this role his own and with other strong actors such as Sean Penn staring, there not very much that could of gone wrong.",Carlito's Way
100,Panterken,A must-see for every self-respecting crime movie-lover ! Brilliant...!!,8,2 December 2007,"Carlito's way is Scarface's older brother...it's a movie with a similar theme and with the same director and lead actor. I believe Carlito's way to be as good as or even superior to Scarface. Pacino's performance is one of the best of his career but it's Sean Penn who proves with this he's worthy of his recently received Oscar. Carlito's way is deeper than Scarface, there isn't as much action but fans of the genre will still be satisfied. There's one scene in particular I consider to be one of the most memorable scenes in recent cinematic history. I'm of course not going to spoil it for the rest of you, but you'll immediately know what I mean when watching the movie.This is a must-see for every self-respecting crime movie-lover out there. Even if you're not a fan of the genre, watch it for Pacino & Penn's marvelous performances.This gets my highest recommendation. 10/10",Carlito's Way
101,m_madhu,reminiscent of scarface .... but different nevertheless,8,2 March 2002,"brian depalma and al pacino get together again to try and recreate the magic and success of scarface. and yet again, they deliver. while the movie is quite similar to scarface in terms of generic plot. the difference really is in the characters, where scarface was ruthless and going down the drain, carlito is desperately trying to turn a new leaf and return to the ""normal"" world.again, al pacino shines and steals every scene, but the surprise package here is sean penn who is quite impressive as the conniving evil lawyer. this movie is a lot more subtle and gentle than scarface. the one big problem really is that the viewer is constantly comparing it with scarface, and the earlier movie's shadow looms large throughout. for those who have not seen scarface, this will be a revelation and an engaging couple of hours. however, the warning is that the mood is sombre and heavy for the entire length of the movie, there are no light moments or trivialities and honestly, the romance angle doesnt really cut it.however, this will still be a must-watch for all fans of gangster movies and offcourse al pacino fans cannot afford to miss it.an engrossing 8!",Carlito's Way
102,elcopy,Overlooked jewel,8,15 June 2007,"De Palma and Pacino pair up once more in a movie about another Latin outlaw, yet this is as close to Scarface as it's going to get. This movie is completely different, which is going to disappoint Scarface fans. Pacino's Carlito Brigante is not Antonio Montana by a mile. If you're going to watch a great performance is going to come from Sean Penn and his bad perm. Trust me, it's one of the greatest performances in movie history. De Palma has many hits and misses in his career, this movie cleared some bad taste out of the stinker that was ""The Bonfire of the Vanities"" and it's perhaps his best film after Scarface and the Untouchables.",Carlito's Way

I don't see how it could be called a classic though. It has it's moments and the visuals are good as are they in most Brian De Palma films. It has good acting and Sean Penn does another stellar performance but it's missing something. What it's missing is originality, and that is what Scarface had even though it was kind of a remake it's self. This film even ends the same way Scarface did. This film might be better if you have not seen Scarface but I could not say because I watched Scarface first. I don't see what would draw you to see this film besides having liked Scarface except maybe you are just a fan of De Palma and this is what you came across first.

105,brandon_lee420,Al Pacino rocks in this film!,8,21 January 2010,"Right from the start this film looked promising and it sure was all the way through to the end. It is predictable that whatever Al Pacino stars in is going to be a masterpiece of some sort. Carlito's Way is another one of his masterpiece and what's even better is that Sean Penn costars and Brian De Palma directs this film as well. The beginning makes no sense at all but right from that moment as Al's character voice overs it just gives you a good masterpiece sort of feeling. Everyone should be grateful and privileged that they are seeing one of the best movies ever made. The dialog is fine and the story is interesting while some of the action scenes are smart and cool. Al Pacino is the best actor in this whole film because without him this film would be junk and should be avoided at all costs but thankfully Brian De Palma casted him. Sean Penn was good as well but his appearance looked hideous and made him look like a complete retarded lawyer. To put a long story short: Sean Penn could not give a better performance than Al Pacino. The real credit goes to the director, Brian De Palma. for creating this and without him all would be lost and watching this movie would be a waste of time. F*ck the Golden Globes for not giving Carlito's Way an award because this film is as good as Scarface and Good Fellas. The music is this film is pretty explosive and it really captures you at the end fight scene.Carlito, a Puerto-Rican drug boss, is out prison after serving five years all thanks to his lawyer friend David Klienfeld. He vows to stop his past from landing him in jail again but trouble starts following him and young druggies want to make a name for themselves. He becomes embroiled in something dangerous even for him and when things go bad he has to run away from some enemies. His old girlfriend gets back with him and together they have to make it out alive. A trail of deception always follows him. Cops and killers will be after him and he has to outwit them all and save himself.This film is not like how Scarface was, all blood and guts with no story, but this film is unique because it offers a great potential story with minimum amount of gore. You have to watch out for the fight sequences because they will blow you away and I mean really blow you away. This film does have flaws and one of them is the bad acting from Viggo Mortensen and he sucked bad because he didn't look like a gangster at all. Guess he was still a rookie back then. The other big flaw is Al Pacino's Puerto Rican accent which fails him completely to where he was born: America or Puerto Rico. Overall, this film doesn't disappoint but many people will be disappointed because this film tells the end before the beginning and they are right that it ruins the point of the film. Everyone should have a good time even though if it is a little bit slow or boring but wait until the end. Please! If you liked this film, I also recommend Good Fellas, Scarface, Casino, American Gangster, and Death Sentence.",Carlito's Way
106,rusoviet,Long boring film that had a great cast....,3,4 March 2012,...but little besides. The director was either controlled by his cast or he was given a bad script. It began with promise but it seemed like a sanitized version of Scarface cept' this time the protagonist is a reformed hoodlum. That had promise but then it begins to wonder into the same bad choices seen in 'Rounders' by Matt Damon.Penelope Ann Miller is a very plain looking female and I mean plain then again maybe that is what the script called for.I turned it off with 20 minutes to go - there was no compelling reason to finish watching the film. Sean Penn's skill was wasted in this film. It was a claustrophobic meandering mess. Plain boring and bad.,Carlito's Way

Or run away and be locked or killed by gangs. He chose to run.I found the film a little bit boring in the middle of it. A lot of talking and sceneries with just sound. I might even say that there is 15 to 30 minutes that are just unnecessary. waste of time.,Carlito's Way
108,frankwhat,So Emotional,10,12 September 2004,"What a fantastic movie. This is seriously the only movie I know that you can take a snapshot of any part in the film and it would classify as a gorgeous picture. The cinematography is just so beautiful it's so easy to get lost in the scene. Plus the acting is glorious with Pacino giving one of his top 3 performances (including ""Scent of a Woman"" and ""Scarface""). I rarely like Sean Penn but this was one of the few roles that even I have to admit he did a great job on. I'm sorry but Ángel Salazar is a pimp and anyone who says otherwise doesn't know what they're talking about. I'm just kidding but that little guy is just so awesome, he was in ""Scarface"" too and all the girls think he's adorable. If I was a director I'd throw him in so many more movies like he deserves. Also props to Luis Guzman as Pachanga, he is seriously one of the ugliest actors out there and to make it big looking like that I have to give my hats off to him as he is a fabulous actor and deserves all of it. You get so attached to Carlito because he's such a lovable guy even with his shady past that the end is very hard to accept.

His cocaine-addicted lawyer David who helped him out of prison embezzled a big sum of money that belonged to an in-jail gangster chief. To solve the problem, tricky David made good use of Carlito. But that landed both of them in a dangerous situation.Although Carlito did his best, he failed. It was ironic that his mercy made his tragedy. The final chasing scene was really breathtaking.

111,jcanettis,Al Pacino Plays A Different Type of Gangster,8,12 April 2005,"Al Pacino has starred as a prominent gangster in several masterpieces: ""Godfather"" I, II, and III, as well as ""Scarface"", have shown his undisputed talent. In all four of them, Pacino played the mean and ruthless mobster, who dominates the street: Either as a skillful and much-feared ""capo di capi"" in the ""Godfather"" series, or as a talented, yet self-destructive, mobster who rises to the top (and then collapses) in ""Scarface"".""Carlito's Way"" would seem to be a replica of the above successful formula, at first sight: Al Pacino is Carlito Brigante, a mobster who has just got out of jail with the help of his friend and lawyer, David Kleinfeld (Penn). However, this is where the similarities end. Whereas in all the above films Pacino is portrayed as a determined and unreformed criminal to the very end, Carlito is a very different type of guy: In fact, as soon as he is out, he has taken the brave decision to change path. He wants to give up his criminal ways, and become an honest citizen. To this end, he runs a bar, trying to collect some money so as to set up a car-rental business. However, although he has the wholehearted support of his girlfriend Gail (Miller) to this project, it is difficult to escape his past. Even his friend and lawyer, Kleinfeld, proves to be an obstacle to his road towards salvation.Brian De Palma has directed a great film, in which he portrays brilliantly the character of a man who agonizes to make a clean start, but encounters everywhere forces which push him back to his dark roots. Al Pacino is (again) great, while both Penelope Ann Miller and Sean Penn are very good as the two competing and opposite influences for Carlito.""Carlito's Way"" is less a crime film, and more a drama one, according to my opinion. The story is beautiful, and although the beginning of the film seems to give some hints, we do not know until the very end whether this man of good intentions managed to escape from his ghosts or not. Watch and find for yourselves! 8/10.",Carlito's Way
112,amirma-78982,Al Pacino,8,20 May 2020,"Al Pacino is an icon of gangster movies , I don't think another will cover his place in this kind of movies.
Good to watch another good movie of him .",Carlito's Way
113,n-mo,Flawed but underrated,8,7 August 2009,"The understandable temptation is to compare ""Carlito's Way"" with ""Scarface""--Al Pacino as a Hispanic lead character embroiled gangster wars--but the two films are nothing alike in their approach. ""Scarface"" takes a definitive ""shoot-em-up"" line, while ""Carlito's Way"" is far more character-driven. And it is an excellent film, drawing us into the underworld as a closed system with its own set of rules and a society truly apart from ""good old-fashioned mainstream American justice,"" so that we can sympathize with these characters despite their criminality.Some may find the romance scenes distracting. Graphic, certainly, but the addition of Penelope Ann Miller plays Gail extremely well opposite Pacino, and furthermore is a valuable addition to the cast for the way she fits into the theme. As a female character who walks the line between the beacon of moral light that is traditionally a woman in such a story and playing--in a woman's way--with the ambiguities of quick cash versus personal integrity, she helps Carlito to take a step back and think about the global implications of his struggle and his choices.Sean Penn's character was perhaps a bit more difficult for me to swallow: while the filmmakers went out of their way to foreshadow potential trouble, they failed to show much to indicate a deeply compromised internal character until almost right before the climax.As for the scene at Grand Central Terminal, what can I say? Cliché, perhaps, but extremely well-executed. The idea of having to catch the train and running up against that narrow wall of time and death when everything in your world is at stake is a nightmare I have dreamt many times over and easily kept me on the edge of the seat. (Incidently, I don't think I've ever made the train/plane before waking up, but neither can I recall actually missing it.)All-in-all, good for a quick evening alone with some whiskey in a big city besides New York to make you think about going back to New York... almost.",Carlito's Way

As he was doublecrossed by his lawyer Kleinfeld ( Sean Penn) it turned into a cat and mouse game, with roles reversed . Al Pacino is Carlito personified and Sean Penn as the evil, coke sniffing lawyer with a clown's head played the anti hero like it's his second skin. Brian de Palma had a string of solid material in the 80s and 90s, Carlito's Way is one in the list. Joe Cocker's song will make you cry and sentimental at the very end.",Carlito's Way
115,JimD73,Very solid entry into the gangster genre,8,16 August 2009,"A very solid entry into the gangster section of your local video store, but not quite the greatness of Goodfellas or Godfather, nor quite the unabashed fun of De Palma's Scarface. The storyline is a little different than others, with Carlito (Pacino) legitimately attempting to go straight after a brief prison stint, but continually being dragged back into the business.The solid plot is supported by an excellent cast. Pacino is perfectly in his element, perhaps a version of Tony Montana who's had time to wise up. Sean Penn steals the show as his slimy lawyer/friend Kleinfeld. If you've played GTA Vice City, you know the character quite well. Penelope Ann Miller is very seductive as Carlito's long lost love. Also memorable is John Leguizamo's up-and-coming hothead. Viggo Mortensen takes the cake as a one-scene wonder, a wheelchair bound ex-gangster. Iin his short screen time gives by far the best performance of the movie.The end sequence is very harrowing, despite being one of those movies that shows the beginning first. Carlito gives periodical voiceovers, which are supposedly full of wisdom but just become tiresome after a while. They are perfectly reasonable introducing certain characters, but sometimes less is more.Carlito's Way isn't the best film of its genre, but it is plenty serviceable and very enjoyable. If you've seen all the big ones, this is a good choice to put next in the pecking order.",Carlito's Way
116,CinefanR,Carlito's ways with women...,10,1 June 2012,"Not nearly as funny as De Palma's other masterpiece of the ""unintentionally hilarious"" (""Scarface"" of course), ""Carlito's Way"" has its moments though. Pacino's struggle with linguistic intricacies such as ""foreign accents"", is once again, very funny, especially since he seems to occasionally switch from this supposedly ""Puerto Rican accent"" to his ""Scent of a Woman"" mannerisms. The insertion of ""You Are So Beautiful"" song was so out of place, it earns a chuckle. Also funny was a surprising cameo from Viggo Mortensen.It turns out Carlito is none other than Mr. Right. Who could have imagined that a mobster can be such a nice guy? You've gotta admire Carlito's ways with women. He's so respectful, understanding, kind and always in control (he's not even jealous) Now of course that's completely unbelievable for a mobster (a killer that is), but it's alright, it's a De Palma film.The terribly uninspired narration by Al Pacino deserves a special note. Badly written and contrived, it adds nothing more than embarrassment.The movie is very enjoyable nonetheless. And unlike Michael Corleone, I really like Brigante.",Carlito's Way
117,eamon-hennedy,The finest collaboration between Pacino and De Palma.,10,17 November 2003,"This is one of those films that should you bring it up in a conversation, a lot of people will not have seen. They may have heard of it, but you may get someone who doesn't even know that it exists. If you find it on television, it will be buried away at a graveyard slot and this is a shame as Carlito's Way is without doubt one of the finest crime films to grace the screen is undoubtedly the best collaboration between Al Pacino and Brian De Palma. I really like Scarface, it is a hugely enjoyable film, but if Scarface is more similar to a a bottle of beer, then Carlito's Way is more like a bottle of fine wine. It has a more graceful taste that less excessive taste goes down more easily. There is none of the excessiveness that punctuated Scarface. The production design is not as over the top, the violence is toned down a notch and the performance from Al Pacino is more restrained, bringing to mind his finest performances from the 1970's such as The Godfather Part I and II, Dog Day Afternoon and Serpico. Here he delivers a performance that undoubtedly deserved Oscar consideration, while De Palma proves there is more to him than just a stylish sensibility. Yes, there are many of his trademark directorial touches such as the prolonged suspense, the main action sequence taking place in a train station and frequent long takes where the camera continually moves and never stops. Truth is the story here is what makes this film so compelling, despite the foundations that it rests on being cliches from every other crime film that you will have ever seen.
The character of Carlito is released from prison and is determined to go straight. We all know that this will never happen. He wants to set up a new life in the Bahamas operating a car rental agency. This will never  happen. He wants to start this new life with the woman he loves. This too, we know, will never happen. What makes this film so brilliant is that De Palma decides not to treat the audience like idiots. The first image of the film is of Carlito being gunned down, lying on death's door in a train station. Immediately we know that this character is never going to escape and despite this De Palma still manages to squeeze every inch of suspense in the final moments. This makes the film one of the most moving that I have ever seen. We really grow to like this character to the point that we hope that he doesn't die in the final reel, but alas this is no fairy tale and no matter how hard he tries and how much we want him to, Carlito is doomed.Al Pacino's performance here is, and I cannot stress this enough, fantastic. He never shouts, never goes into blistering shouting mode, he delivers a performance of amazing restraint that one quickly realizes why he is always at the top of lists that deem him to be the finest actor working today. The supporting cast here also put in some great work. Sean Penn quite possibly puts in a career best performance as Carlito's lawyer, the character who is the real villain of the piece, while Penelope Anne Miller is luminous as Gail, the love of Carlito's life.  The chemistry between both Miller and Pacino is superb and one really gains a sense of why they are willing to run away from it all at the end of the film.Behind the camera De Palma proves what a versatile and fantastic filmmaker he is. Forever doomed to be known as a director of Hitchcock tributes, he shows us what he is really like behind the camera, proving to his detractors that he can make material on his own merit. Unlike previous films he has made, you will be hard pressed to find homages to Hitchcock and Eisenstein films here. This is undoubtedly his finest picture and one that should have earned him a nomination for best director at the 1993 Academy Awards. Likewise Pacino and Miller. Amazingly Penn did get a much deserved award for his performance, amazing because for once the Academy did something right.On top of all this we have a fantastic music score from Patrick Doyle and one of the most moving death scenes in recent memory, if you have yet to see Carlito's Way, please do. It is quite simply a masterpiece.",Carlito's Way

I remember the first time I watched Carlito's Way, aged 18, as one of the most cathartic experiences in my life. At the end, I was choking with emotion, my eyes were welling with tears and my trembling hands instinctively rose in the air and clapped, as I shouted ""Bravo!"", even if the rest of the auditorium were already grabbing their coats as if they had just watched any old movie. The infinite beauty of this romantic tragedy had left me gobsmacked and I just wanted to stay there and sit through the whole thing again, straight away. For weeks afterwards I became obsessed with the world of Carlito Brigante, with Al Pacino, with Brian De Palma (I also saw Scarface in that period, and it instantly became another of my all-time favourites). I had already loved movies before, but Carlito's Way cemented my love for cinema forever and made it into a passion. And ever after I saw Carlito's Way, I have been going to the cinema as often as I can, driven by the hope that another film will come along that can make me feel the same ""high"" as that unforgettable day. A handful have achieved it (Shawshank, Seven, 12 Monkeys, Cidade de Deus...), but Carlito will always stay in my mind as the film that discovered me the overwhelming power of what a roll of 35 mm celluloid tape can do to the human soul.",Carlito's Way

122,Aditya_Gokhale,Great movie..vastly underrated!,9,2 December 2005,"Great movie..and I can see why it is underrated...possibly due to obvious comparisons to Scarface (Brian De Palma, Martin Bregman, Al Pacino team), which was much more brutal in its approach.Al Pacino as Carlito, awesome as he is, is still much softer compared to the sledgehammer Tony Montana. And then there is some romance mixed in with the story of a gangster trying to reform himself.I didn't like the romantic scenes myself...thought they interrupted the flow of the story...hence I gave it a 9 instead of a 10! There is also some clichéd dialogue. I happen to be a big Pacino fan and so I am being a little bit (though not entirely) biased and am sidelining all these things. If you excuse these small potatoes, this one is a great flick from start to finish, very entertaining, with some fantastic performances from the supporting cast, e.g. Sean Penn.

126,mrrockey,"A Bit Familiar, but Still Entertaining",7,27 July 2014,"Carlito's Way is basically the thematic and stylistic sequel to Scarface. Not only does the film have a very similar aesthetic look to Scarface, the film basically tells the inverse story of that film, what if he tried to change? Scarface was about a man who thought he had it all and overestimated his own intelligence and luck which ultimately led to his downfall whereas Carlito's Way is about a man KNOWING that he can't survive in the violent world of crime and trying to escape it.Al Pacino plays a Puerto Rican ex-con named Carlito Brigade who gets out of prison after serving five years of a thirty-year sentence due to technicalities with the help of his lawyer, David Kleinfeld(played by Sean Penn) in 1975 New York Spanish Harlem. Carlito tries his best to stay away from his past life of dealing drugs so he works at a nightclub to make enough money to retire in the Caribbean. But sooner or later, Carlito is dragged back into a life of crime, murder, and betrayal.Carlito's Way is certainly not a bad film. It has some good performances, the direction is great, the cinematography is often beautiful to look at, and the film is entertaining from start to finish. But what makes the film good but not great is its familiarity. Not only does the film feel exactly like Scarface, the story just feels very familiar. It's the classic story of a criminal trying to redeem himself but the film never puts any interesting spins on the concept. It basically just boils down to him not wanting to be part of crime anymore, then he's forced to do a job for someone, then he's forced to use violence and break the law again. The film's story is never as engrossing as I wished it to be, because it just feels so familiar.But even though the story is a bit familiar, this is an undeniably well- made movie. For one thing, the direction is highly energetic. As usual, De Palma directs the film with a stylized feel that makes the film have a very larger-than-life, cinematic feel. It's as if De Palma KNOWS that it's just a movie and doesn't really care about realism and while a lot of people like to complain things that are ""unrealistic"" these days, I think De Palma's direction actually works in the film's favor. The emotions of every scene are always brought to the forefront with a somewhat melodramatic score by Patrick Doyle and some showy camera-work. Some may say this makes the film lack subtlety, but I think it makes the film much more entertaining than had if he went for a ""realistic"" approach.De Palma's direction really shines during the final chase sequence. The camera-work is incredibly fluid with an excellent use of long takes following Carlito around as he's being chased in the train station and the whole scene is flawlessly edited and incredibly suspenseful. Doyle's score adds to the tension as well. This scene alone, makes the whole film worth seeing at the cinemas.The cinematography by Stephen H. Burum does an excellent job conveying both the gritty, crime-ridden environment of Spanish Harlem and the high-end style nightclub where Carlito works. The scenes at the night look JUST like Scarface, with a disco, neon, purplish look to the whole thing. While this isn't a particularly challenging role for Pacino, he once again, does a good job and is a complete bada$$ the whole film. Penelope Ann Miller is OKAY in the role of Gail, Carlito's love interest, but I feel this role could've been given to a bajillion other actresses at the time. But for me, the biggest scene stealer is Sean Penn as David Kleinfeld. Penn is just great to watch as this coked-up, sleazy lawyer. He easily has the most energy out of everyone in the cast and is the most interesting character of the film. John Leguizamo is fun as a young, up-and-coming gangster not unlike Carlito in his early years.If there's any gripes I have with the film, outside of the fact that it feels too familiar, it'd be Carlito's downfall. While it's well-written for the most part, I feel his first act of violence in the film where he shoots up some drug dealers in a set-up deal his cousin brought him to, comes too soon in the film. Carlito just shoots them off and there's that, no repercussions whatsoever. Now there is something I like to this, which is how quick the violence escalates in the film. It keeps the pacing nice and brisk but at the same time, I feel his downfall would've had more impact if it was a straight-forward downward spiral. Instead of starting out peaceful, then violent for a bit, then back to peaceful a bit, and then back to violence.Overall, while Carlito's Way's story may feel a bit familiar, De Palma's direction, the performances, the cinematography, and the overall entertainment value still make for a decent film. As long as you don't expect the brilliance of Scarface, you'll enjoy it. 7/10",Carlito's Way
127,concrndone,Cartoon gangsters,8,9 October 2021,"I must have watched this a million times in the 90s as a student, I loved this film so much. Now as a middle-aged man, it's ok. Its like a cartoon gangster film compared to say a Godfather or Goodfellas which still hold up. Very stereotypical characters. Viggo Mortenson, Sean Penn and Pacino stand out and make this what it is.It still has immense entertainment value though.",Carlito's Way
128,Lt_Coffey_182,"Acting, direction and writing all spot on for a top gangster film",8,16 November 2005,"Inevitably, Carlito's Way will always be compared to Scarface. Same director, same star, same genre; it is difficult to watch this film without thinking of Scarface. This is very unfortunate for Carlito's Way as it is second rate compared to Scarface but it is a very good film and many people have failed to see this.Where Scarface was about a South American battling his way to the top of the crime world, Carlito's Way is about a South American gangster trying to leave his past behind him. The story is very good and believable, the problems for Carlito (Al Pacino) are very typical for someone in his position and the relationships are all very convincing. The fact that Edwin Torres based his characters on real people and that events in the film are inspired by real life, really help Carlito's Way to be a credible film. The fact that it is Carlito's lawyer, Kleinfeld (Sean Penn), who got him out of prison and then becomes a loose cannon who provides Carlito with too many problems is a great illustration of respect and excess going to someone's head.The performances in this film are extremely strong. Al Pacino is one of the best actors ever to be witnessed and is on outstanding form here. The beard, shades and long coat are a very good look for him and definitely provide him with one of his most fashionable roles to date. What is most convincing in this performance is his charm towards Gail (Penelope Ann Miller) as the audience, along with Gail, fall for him instantly, despite knowing his past. His scenes with Sean Penn are also amongst the films strong points because it always good to see Pacino act angry. The dialogue between these two is exceptional and really highlights how strongly Carlito's Way is written. Sean Penn does not let Pacino outclass him and gives one of his strongest performances. As an arrogant coke head, Penn portrays a character who is really repulsive and dislikeable and incites a great sense of hatred from the audience. Penelope Ann Miller does well to give the film feeling and bring it down to earth. It is pleasurable to watch her inner conflicts regarding Carlito as she pulls off the emotional scenes very professionally and is very effective at drawing out an emotional response from the audience. Luis Guzman and John Leguizamo are the two most memorable characters from the supporting cast, they both fit specific niches very well and both give great performances. It was nice to see Adrian Pasdar in the film, shame he wasn't in it for longer as the writers could have made something more out of his character.My only negative criticism of the film is that it could have done with a touch more action. Gangster films are at their most exciting when there is a high drama shootout but Carlio's Way only has two major action scenes. Luckily, the content is good enough to make up for this. The two shootouts are very good scenes, especially the last one as the tension build up is so intense.Stylish, realistic and stimulating, Carlito's Way would be a classic gangster film, had it not been overshadowed and over compared to Scarface. All the ingredients are right to serve up a fantastic film.",Carlito's Way
129,jb-448,Excellent,8,2 March 2008,"Everybody puts out here. The male characters put out brilliant performances and Penelope Ann Miller puts out her lady lumps! And she does well as Gail. This has to be one of the best Pacino movies ever and feels a lot more personal and more of a character study then De Palma and Pacino's earlier Scarface. We basically follow Carlito Brigante trying to go legit after leaving jail. His lawyer Kleinfeld (Penn) draws him to disaster after they kill a gangster. Benny Blanco, a punk Carlito dislikes eventually kills Carlito. He hooks up with old flame Gail and we later find her in a strip club, (cue nude scene)! Anyway, this movie is yet another good way to spend a couple of hours 8/10",Carlito's Way
130,brainofj72,"Very Well-Made, Yet Somewhat Formulaic",8,27 August 2005,"It seems like there is a point in many directors' careers when they feel the need to try and recreate a former glory they once had. This attempt usually results in a not-so-glorious film. Scorsese did it when he tried to practically remake ""GoodFellas"" with ""Casino"", Coppola did it when he made ""The Godfather Part III"", and De Palma did it when he made ""Carlito's Way"".""Carlito's Way"" is the story of Carlito Brigante (Pacino), a street gangster who is acquitted of a thirty-year sentence after just five years thanks to his weaselly lawyer (Penn). He then tries to make a legitimate life for himself by running a nightclub, but ties to his old friends sucks him unwillingly back into the criminal underworld.The film is incredibly well made. De Palma has become a masterful director by 1993, and he showcases his full talent in ""Carlito's Way"". Every shot is thought-out and followed-through excellently, resulting in a film with perfect direction that maintains an extremely coherent visual feel throughout its 140+ minute running time.So why only a B+? Well, the fact is that ""Carlito's Way"" is just not very original. There are multitudes of gangster films out there, and sometimes it's just hard for one to stand out. Also, as I stated earlier, De Palma is repeating himself. An ethnic gangster...a nightclub...Al Pacino...a life of sex, drugs, and violence...any of this ring a bell? Any of this sound suspiciously similar to Scarface (1983)? But all that aside, ""Carlito's Way"" is still a well made, thoroughly enjoyable crime film, and really, anything Al Pacino is involved in most likely warrants at least a viewing or two.8/10",Carlito's Way

Acting excellence that extends from uniformly well-etched and acted secondary roles and performances all around,superbly enacted romantic allure from Penelope Ann Miller to a performance from Al Pacino -- as strong as his turns in the Godfather films-- that unifies the film and lends it the dignity of tragedy.

134,Josh_The_Third,A classic,8,23 April 2015,"This movie is great. I'd like to compare it to ""Donnie Brasco"". Both are about gangs, both are Pacino-centric. Makes you think - which one is better? right off the bat you might say ""Donnie"" takes it. It has much more character study and interesting relationships, with the excellent Johnny Depp there, and the few comedic moments are gold. ""Carlito's Way"" doesn't have all that, it keeps things more simple, BUT, the simplicity does give the plot a more solid edge with more ""sting"" to it, also due to the better, if not ingenious, action scenes; Carlito's not just a (ex)gang leader, he's an assassin. Oh well, I can't really decide here - both are good. I will say tough, that I personally find both are way better than the popular ""Heat"". Sorry De Niro !Lastly, I must add, the more I see of Pacino, the more he becomes one of my favorite actors. Many are talented and can ""steal the show"", but Pacino doesn't just steal it', he practically MAKES the movie what it is. He's not just in the movie. He IS the movie.

135,morfeus,A brilliant gangster movie!,10,31 December 2004,"This is one of the two greatest works of a true master - Brian de Palma. Just like it's ""brother"", Scarface, the movie gives us an insight of a criminal world, with all it's cruelty, deceit, lies and fatal decisions which can change ones life forever. As we observe the last days of a retired gangster Carlito Brigante, it's hard not to admire skills of the director, as a quite usual story of a good guy trying to quit ""the business"" turns into an epic and a cult movie right in front of our eyes. The movie also contains some important messages, and one of the most important is: ""Never give up your friends, no matter what...""

The monologue/narration is bad; it tries to supply some depth to the movie but the acuteness is just not there and it ads nothing to the plot - it reveals the ending at the beginning - depressingly little intelligence here; the movie lacks in punch and does not have the credibility it seeks. Al Pacino and Penelope Ann Miller's love affair is unconvincing, there's no chemistry between the two, their emphasis is often wrong. Thought Al Pacino as Carlito Brigante is quite good, Sean Penn is brilliant as Kleinfeld.

I first heard its in ""Carlito's Way"" and I listen its until today. Brian De Palma made a lot of great films, I'm delighted with ""Scarface"", ""The Untouchables"" and ""Casualties of War"" but ""Carlito's Way"" is that film that I will take with myself on a desert island because it's perfect example of flawless directing, excellent acting and really timeless movie.

The climax scene which reminded me of ""The Untouchables"" was fun, but for me, the greatest de Palma moment came in the first ten minutes when Carlito gets mixed up in a pool-room gunfight.

147,Johnny0581,One of the best crime dramas of the 90's,10,6 March 2005,"Brian De Palma and Martin Bregman, the guys who were responsible for the gangster classic ""Scarface"" had scored another classic with ""Carlito's Way"". Based on a novel by Edwin Torres, the screenplay adaptation, who incredibly was about to be turned down by Bregman, is one of the best crime movies of the 90's or perhaps of all time.I was always curious about this movie and waited over 10 years to see it. I finally decided to just buy the DVD, and let me tell you it was the best twelve bucks i've ever spent in my life. I was not disappointed one bit.Al Pacino gives an Oscar-worthy performance as Carlito Brigante, a Puerto Rican hustler from the 70's who has just served five years in prison and has vowed to live a clean life and stay away from crime, but finds it very difficult to stay out of the streets and out of trouble once he gets back to the old neighborhood and meets up with his old acquaintances, and little by little finds himself going back to the same life that put him behind bars in the first place. Sean Penn gives another Oscar-worthy performance as Brigante's lawyer and friend David Kleinfeld, who is very much involved in Brigante's world of crime in his own way and is way crazier and reckless than he looks. Penelope Ann Miller is great and very sexy as Pacino's love interest Gail. The rest of the supporting cast is excellent as well: Luis Guzman, as Carlito's right hand man Pachanga, the then-unknown Viggo Mortensen, in a short appearance as Carlito's acquaintance, Lalin, and of course one of the most memorable characters, John Leguizamo as a drug-dealer with high ambitions, ""Benny Blanco from The Bronx"". This movie is filled with great dialogue and even greater performances and is one of those movies that usually critics pound but that audiences love for generations. The movie's soundtrack is great as well, the disco hits and the salsa music perfectly fit the mood of every scene and truly take you back to that time. This is by far one of Pacino's best movies in his career and he should've definitely at least been nominated for an Oscar.

The standout of this film however, has to be Sean Penn. His acting was so brilliant that without him, the film would've suffered quite a bit.

I happened to be flipping channels on my TV one night when I came across ""Carlito's Way"". Immediately, I was drawn into the film. By the time the credits rolled by, I knew I had just witnessed the greatest film I had ever seen.What makes ""Carlito's Way"" such a great film is the fact that even though you know what is going to happen at the end, the movie makes you want to know how this character, Carlito Brigante, ends up where he does.  And what a ride it is.Al Pacino is simply astonishing as Carlito Brigante, a reformed criminal who wants nothing more than to leave his old life behind and start anew.  Sean Penn proves once again that he is one of the most effective actors working today in a role that not only sees him keeping pace with Pacino, but should have netted him a Best Supporting Actor Oscar.  John Leguizamo and Viggo Mortensen also deliver solid performances.""Carlito's Way"" is filled with scene after incredible scene, and line after incredible line; all of which lead up to one of the greatest finales in motion picture history.

152,haasxaar,Pacino and Penn deliver a knockout,9,3 October 2006,"There is a scene midway through the film that really exemplifies why I think it is so good almost purely because of the acting. Penn, in the shape of a sleazy, lowlife lawyer wants to persuade Pacino, Carlito (a reformed gangster) to help in a jailbreak. The dialogue is not that great. The direction is good, albeit not noteworthy. Yet, what really makes it so good is the chemistry, the talent of Penn and Pacino together - they make their characters just that much more memorable, that scene just that bit more inviting and engaging and the film instead of being an above average gangster flick into something quite brilliant.The story is quite simple really. Carlito, a former Puerta Rican bad-ass wants to make good and start up a legitimate franchise renting cars. He remains trapped by his criminal instincts, his whole social circle is entrenched in immorality. The world seems different now, Carlito is now older, he needs to find a way out of the New York underworld before it kills him. He rekindles an old romance in the hope of starting a new, normal life.The characters in this film are unforgettable, although not always armed with the best dialogue De Palma gives Penn, Pacino and the rest of the cast enough opportunity to shine. By no one does no one element in this film deliver. Kleinfeld, is not just another lawyer, thanks to Penn he is now a vulnerable, moody cocaine addict. Carlito, is not just a merciless criminal, he is also a sensitive, varied character. De Palma manages to create individuals and individual moments that really cannot be easily erased from memory. The set design, and set pieces are were De Palma really comes into his own. There are many brilliant scenes in the disco, in nightclubs, in New York Central Station that belong to De Palma's best work.De Palma avoids the more showy and gauche tendencies of his direction to give us a truly great character study. There are so many scenes that really stay with you for awhile thereafter and the ending, though maybe not unexpected will definitely have you thinking and asking - why doesn't De Palma produce something this good ever again?",Carlito's Way

156,luminous_luciano,Far More Substance Than Scarface AND Good Fellas BOTH!,7,12 May 2006,"What an underrated yet truly great film! The Brian De Palma-Martin Bregman-Al Pacino association sparks obvious comparisons to 1983's Scarface, their first collaboration - however 1993's CARLITO'S WAY is the richer film in so many important ways. It has so much subtext, emotion, delves far deeper into the mind and even the soul of its main character with the result that Carlito Brigante becomes someone you root for and care about - which was not necessarily true about Tony Montana, despite his gory end in ""Scarface""...The name ""Brigante"" makes one who speaks French immediately think of ""brigand"" - a bandit from the gutter right there. The irony here is that it is the name of the reformed criminal and very much worthy human being that we wind up 100% behind in his hopeless quest for a brand new life... a future... and el paraiso.The romantic scenes were an oasis of bliss amidst the grisly world and tangled web that was weaving itself around Carlito as the movie unfolded (thanks to Carlito's crooked counselor but also, quite ironically too, thanks to Carlito's own willingness to reform and ""be good""...) Verily, the romance with Gail (what a luminous -what else- performance by Penelope Ann Miller) is what humanizes this film. Whereas Scarface was soulless almost, cold and all about the underworld, this film has a soul and this romance is it. She is the angel who can lead the way to the dream of El Paraiso for Carlito - the sharpest contrast there could be; he dresses in black and she is blonde, with a porcelain complexion and ethereal almost! The problem is that she is not the only ethereal presence in the film, and the other one is a ghastly one that haunts him and will never go away until it destroys him. That ghost finds an eerie embodiment in ""Benny Blanco"" (another -of many reasons- to hate John Leguizamo; this role right here!) and Carlito will pay the price for sparing someone that could come back to haunt and hurt him... This unfortunate bit is my lone gripe against this masterpiece; but a happy ending would have cheapened this ode to the human frailty, probably...For, indeed, Carlito's Way has a message - and that message is that, no matter what we do, we cannot escape what we are - ""our way""- and we are destined to follow the course of that until the end. No matter what our intentions are.The supporting cast is phenomenal here, Penelope Ann Miller and Sean Penn especially. Special mentions go to Luis Guzman and even one Viggo Mortensen, who is far from his Aragorn form here - which only proves that he has some range... He is no Pacino, but then again few are... or ever will be.Think of it: Al Pacino has played it all; here, he is the fallen one seeking redemption. And achieving it, though not in the happy ending formulaic way. This same splendid thespian has played the same type of role before - and none were quite alike! Each role has his unique feel and proper substance. Pacino even played the fallen angel who will never seek redemption and he was MORE than believable in that role as well! Truly, he is one of the GREAT ONES. And Penelope Ann Miller holds her own opposite this great thespian. Unlike what many have said, she was NOT miscast here. AT ALL. She hits every note she has to hit, in a truly luminous performance. I would say that she has the same attributes too; every role she undertakes, she gives it a new twist, even if only through some small, almost imperceptible nuances and nothing else, making it all, in the end, new and fresh. One has only to compare all of her previous roles - Gail is unique. And beautiful - not just to Carlito either. That old Joe Cocker song never found a better subject to ""give it life"" than this character right here.This film does leave us with a sad ending though - a lyrical one but one we were hoping not to see. Gail's fears and words come true in the end - and it is bitter irony to realize that we could have had the ""happy ending"" here only if Carlito had kept his ""way"" like it used to be - ruthless all the while through.",Carlito's Way

160,Cinesnatch,Credible big-budget De Palma with Penn in full form,7,31 October 2003,"Brian De Palma lends his masterful directorial hand to a story about a recently released convicted drug dealer. He insists that he's going straight, but, then, he says something not quite as memorable as ""just when I thought I was out, they pull me back in."" Al Pacino playing a Puerto Rican-American is a stretch, physically and vocally. The latter of which becomes all too pronounced whenever his voice pops in the annoying narration. But, this is familiar territory for Pacino, except without the family. He's on the other side of the Italian mob and nobody has his back. His closest ally is cocaine addicted Jewish lawyer cum gangster-wannabe, played by Sean Penn. If you want to know why people bandy about how Penn is `the greatest actor of his generation' and don't understand why, then perhaps his performance in this film will convince you. Any other actor would like a fool in the hair and make-up he sells to the audience rather effortlessly. The guy is a chameleon. Viggo Mortensen appears briefly in a cameo and leaves quiet an impression. At times, particularly towards the end, the material gets trite and cartoonish. Yet, there are scenes that are so well choreographed and teem with tension, that you have to take your hat off to the director. He's a living legend. 7/10.",Carlito's Way

I just can't help my self smiling looking at the guy who run after Carlito in the last scene at Grand Central, he acted like was into Hot shot or a Leslie Nielsen movie, and how about the Big fat guy who didn't even got the chance to shoot right not ""one time"" to Carlito right in front of him...And I must not forget the clock at grand central signing 11.17 and the 25 minutes passed without the 11.30 train have been left yet.I loved Al Pacino acting, simple and deep. Calm like and old and mature man and mean just in the right scene. Nothing over the top and mostly natural.Sean Penn did a great job, but still... a little more irony in his role have would give the character a spin up.Good job for Penelope as well in the role of the Al Pacino so long lover, caring and loving.About the Director of photography I agree with the idea of the big screen shot but some close up were a little ""too much"", better If they would have been left out in my opinion.Music... right for the genre, but sometimes it just didn't fit in, I guess something more could have be done on it as well, for instance, nothing comparing with the ""taxi driver"" soundtrack.So for a movie that pre load the Pulp Fiction break out, GOOD JOB! 8/10 is fare enough.",Carlito's Way

As others have mentioned it is Scarface with ""feelings"" - feelings so strong that I will hapilly admit to welling up at the end. The action is still there in part, but Carlito's Way is a much more grounded and reflective film than Scarface - there are no 70 men gun fights, and Brigante manages to restrict himself to far fewer than the 500000000 odd F words that are spouted from Montanas lips.Although, nothing will ever top Scarface for me, this was deffinetly a worthwhile project and it goes down as one of my faverout films.

Certainly important role in this masterpiece it has gone right Sean Penn, and it is very good, that for that moment it required money! I shall note also, that the main female role obviously concedes to the main things man's, but not because it plays badly. It plays well, but Al Pacino and Sean Penn are simply magnificent. The ending is good, when all seems, that to the protagonist удалосб, and we are waited with the USUAL ""good"" ending, but there is no also this moment very sentimental.

I was totally stunned by my Wife's comment in the theatre after the film when we saw it on it's release week while she was crying and reading the credits at the same time: ""Who did Sean Penn play?""That's how good this film is.

166,g0dolphins,Some of Mr. Pachino's best work,8,9 August 2005,"The recent viewing of this movie for the first time since it was released in the mid 90s confirmed my long held beliefs: this is some of Mr. Pachino's best work on film. But not only does he shine as Carlito, great performances from Penelope Ann Miller (his love interest) and Sean Penn (Carlito's lawyer) are masterfully directed by Brian De Palma in a credible tale of attempted redemption.In this gritty crime/gangster tale, Carlito is released from incarceration on a technicality, and thus begins his attempts to stay clean and legitimate after squandering a lifetime that had culminated with his 30 year sentence. His goal is simple: secure enough money to buy his way into a legitimate business venture. But achieving this is another story altogether. The journey we witness is walking a fine line in the old neighborhood, where he must compete with his reputation among both his peers and the up and coming thugs who have hustled their way into prominence since his conviction some five or so years earlier.Carlito proves to be a complex character with a solid understanding of both right and wrong, as well as very strong ambitions. These two traits are quite often opposed with one another, and it is in this conflict that De Palma brings out the best of Pachino. Somewhere along the way Carlito has won you to his cause, and despite the character flaws and set backs, you want to see him achieve his dream. But as the story unfolds, the stakes and risks are greater and his success seems less likely.What I especially enjoyed in this movie was the narration Pachino had of Carlito in many crucial or pivotal parts of the script. Unlike many of his more well known and recognized roles, where Pachino had long brooding scenes, it was left to our imagination to often times wonder what the character was thinking. In Carlito's Way we are offered a glimpse into that thought process, and it is quite rewarding indeed.Highly recommended. 8 out of 10",Carlito's Way

Unfortunately his crazy dumb lawyer David Kleinfeld (played by a nearly unrecognizable Sean Penn) and the gangs that hang around at his club makes him still in the organized crime land.Pacino is arresting as always. Penn has never been better. Unfortunately sometimes the film goes a little aloof. The music is fantastic. This was filmed a little bit like the films in the 40's and 50's. The best scene had to be when Carlito goes back to his old street for the first time at an unrecognizable club with his cousin and realizes that he actually does not want to be involved with the drug dealing business ever again. Some points in the story are not of value though. It is still a great movie. 8/10",Carlito's Way

One valid criticism could be that the lines get decidedly cheesy at times, but at the end of the day, you can feel yourself in Carlitos dilemmas which appear constantly through the film.  His 'code of conduct' prevents him from doing what he wants to do on several occasions.

While Scarface is more raw, stylish, and edgy, it seems to be trapped in it's own era of dated production. Carlito's Way comes across as a much more refreshing and polished effort. Though not a sequel to the first film, Carlito's Way puts together a good story all its own. The story-plot is similar to ""King of NY"", as a big name gangster returns to the streets after lengthy incarceration, balancing the police on one side and the underworld on the other. But that is where the similarity ends. Pacino plays Carlito Brigante, a ""reformed"" Puerto Rican hood just released from prison in 1975. He gets a second chance at life but soon becomes tangled in a tragic web spun by his previous reputation and one fatal decision. The movie has plenty of familiar faces; Sean Penn, Luis Guzman, Penelope A. Miller, John Leguizamo...

But this film isn't about an ordinary gangster. As the film goes by Carlito comes closer and closer to the criminal world, so in the end this world kills him. His idea was that sometimes men change, but in fact they always suffer from it. It means that if you are in the criminal world you have either to kill or they will kill you - just like in an animal world. Carlito's way has a tragic end, because he tried to free from this cruel world. That's what I understood. Sean Penn is a true master of disguise. You can hardly recognize him.

Good directing from Brian De Palma, but not his best. Pacino plays his role superbly, but does nothing in this movie that we haven't seen him do before, except maybe speak with a Puerto Rican accent, not unlike Scarface's Cuban.

Its a nice tale narrated in a beautiful manner.Pacino ( though he looks better without a beard) has once again played it to the galleries. The dialouges are good, the direction is perfect and the climax grips you. I guess Carlito;s way has all the ingredients to make a good flick. But i wonder why this movie does not make much of a mention like other Pacino flicks. Maybe, it was never marketed well.aaah!! Sean Penn looks different with his fuzzy hair and glasses.

177,Jigsaw_At_The_Disco,Carlito's Way -- The Master of its Genre,10,27 October 2008,"Al Pacino, Sean Penn, and Penelope Ann Miller create an artistic and romantic twist to the gangster genre in Carlito's way, story of a convicted gangster by the name of Carlito Brigante, known to his ex-lover as Charlie, who manages to get his way out of jail thanks to crooked drug-addicted lawyer David Kleinfield. After his release, he's convinced himself that he's never going back to his life of crime, but before he knows it, he's inevitably being pulled back thanks to his corrupt friends and family.While Scareface centered around the action and grittiness of the gangster life more then anything else, Carlito's Way tends to lean to the romantic side, giving the film an artsy twist. For example, in one scene there is a close up shot of a revolver, the chamber slowly moving to an empty slot. There is another famous scene with Carlito inside of a dark bathroom, his back against a wall with a pistol in hand. The way the camera is placed, the way Carlito is standing, and the way the lighting reflects off of the wall and his leather jacket are all taken in to account by De Palma. To make a long story short, Carlito's Way is very beautiful, and this is all thanks to De Palma. He directs the movie very well, you can tell that he put some true dedication in to this film.Needless to say, the acting is incredible, no matter what you might be hearing. Al Pacino is as always great, and Penelope Ann Miller is as well. But most of the time you'll find yourself deeper inside Sean Penn's character then Pacino's or anyone else's. He's steals nearly every scene he's in, if not then he steals all of them. He's almost too convincing.The scores are very, very strong and add on to the artistic feel to the movie. Not only do they add on to that, but it adds to the tension, the romance, and the tears as well.To sum it all up, Carlito's Way is the best gangster film ever made. I love it more and more every time I think about it.*****/*****Riveting.",Carlito's Way

I watched this movie only yesterday and i was amazed. The screenplay was amazing in this movie, as it gives the movie a tone of darkness throughout the film without being full of in-your-face violence. The directing by Brian De Palma was outstanding, and the chase sequence in the train station had my complete attention all the way. The acting by Al Pacino was as good as always, and Sean Penn gave an excellent performance as the coke-headed lawyer-turned-wiseguy. It was also interesting to see Viggo Mortensen as the crippled Lalin.Another interesting thing about this movie is that along with re-uniting director and actor from Scarface, it also features some of the actors from Scarface in minor cameo appearances, such as Hector from Scarface appears as Rolando, who is the man smoking a cigar at the beginning of the movie, who doesn't believe that Carlito retired.A must see movie for fans of Pacino or De Palma 10/10",Carlito's Way

181,militon,Yet another '90s mafia flicks,7,23 January 2008,"I love Al Pacino. Just wanted to state that upfront. Now, his presence is not necessarily a guarantee for a five star movie, but usually it means that the movie is not total crap. This is the case with this particular title.The story is decent enough - Pacino's character, Carlito, is an ex-drug dealer, fresh out of prison, trying to go straight, but unable to do so, as one would expect (there's no quitting or retiring in the crime business).The characters are well enough developed. Carlito, as the main one, in particular. Especially his inadequacy in a world that's new to him (not only the legit world, but also the crime scene, with the new punks, people he knew but he finds to be changed, etc). Sean Penn (who I find annoying at times, but can't deny his talent) plays the support character of David Somethingorother, Carlito's old friend and lawyer. He once again does an extraordinary job. Some of the other characters might seem a little too stereotypical, but most of the '90s crime flicks suffer from this.Brian de Palma does a good job directing this flick, but I can't help wondering if he didn't spend too much of his career doing movies like Carlito's Way, The Untouchables, Wise Guys, Scarface (which are all great, don't get me wrong, just a little similar) and not enough doing things like Bonfire Of The Vanities or Raising Cain.

Having a terrific plot and great story are the elements of this film. The characters involved are very good! I can honestly say that this is highly recommended like ""Scarface"".Al Pacino's character (Carlito Brigante) has sprung from prison on a legal technicality by his cocaine-addled attorney, former drug kingpin Carlito Brigante stuns the local underworld when he vows to go straight. Taking a job managing a glitzy, low-life nightclub, he tracks down his onetime girlfriend and rekindles their romance, promising he's changed for good. But Carlito's dream of going legitimate is undermined at every turn by murderous former cronies and even deadlier young thugs out to make a name for themselves. Ultimately, however, his most dangerous enemy is himself. Despite good intentions, Carlito's misguided loyalties and an outmoded code of ""honor"" will plunge him into a savage life-or-death battle against the relentless forces that refuse to let him go.

Al Pacino's Carlito - a good bad guy who wants to go straight but isn't allowed to (""Just when I'm trying to get out, they drag me back in!"", as he said in Godfather III) - would have been a natural for the young James Cagney, much of whose exhilarating on-screen vitality Pacino shares. De Palma as usual devotes most of his attention and talent to the action set-pieces (especially the joltingly violent pool-room shoot-out and the tour-de-force chase sequence through Grand Central Station), not saving much for the sometimes very lazily handled bits that go in between, but gangster aficionados won't care about that.
Tell you how good a movie this is: when Carlito Brigante got whacked in the final scene, the girl sitting next to me in the cinema gasped ""Oh, no!"" and nearly started crying. Not the most sophisticated reaction in the world, but a more telling guide to a film's powers of emotional engagement than 100 blase reviews in the New Yorker.

185,lopezmaggivonkarma,"""Carlito's Way"" My modest film review",8,2 May 2014,"This is another of Brian De Palma failures that have left him with little chance to reverse, falling totally in the collapse after ""Mission To Mars"", and this Pacino movie has emerged as a cult film. It's actually not so true this last statement: ""Carlito's Way"" is not so much a cult classic, simply because it is always overshadowed by her capricious sister ""Scarface"", but also due to the same reasoning is not completely forgotten because shares a similar geneticIf one compares, ""Carlitos Way"" is slightly better than ""Scarface"", but also has the usual De Palma serious problems (and we do not talk about Hitchcock imitations). But though this 1993 film is based on a book, has a striking eye to correct the errors of the film 1983. Al Pacino is much more controlled (however here also tends to overflow, to relax) and while sometimes falls into inertia, on the other hand is brilliant in the dramatic moments. Also, the relationship with Penelope Ann Miller is much more heartfelt, unlike the insipid and quasi-misogynist Tony Montana / Elvira connection. There is a sense of sophistication over Carlito Brigante, and even the soundtrack is much more current than the over-stylization of Giorgio Moroder, same with the aesthetic that is much less colorfulBut it is true that the argument does not click where it belongs. This is the story of a man who is redeemed, and could be taken two ways: become an existential crime drama à la Woody Allen (highly unlikely), or be a Western transferred to mafia traditions. Instead deviates to casual reflections in the vein of ""The Godfather 3"" (""Just when I thought I was out, they pull me back in""), and then continue as a bastion of ""Scarface"" in style and repeating many of its sins: again the flashy aesthetics in the disco, again the unimpressive criminals, again the ridiculous nicknames for the gangsters (here: ""Saso""; ""Pachanga""; ""Lalin""), again the relentlessly repetition of the word ""fuck"" (the most punished is Sean Penn, who often repeated), again the mediocre actors. While ""Carlito's Way"" corrects some problems of the 1983 movie, in turn there are some pretty bad scenes: the pool scene is artificial, with Pacino went really placing the ball to give right on the target, with Pacino running so clumsy to the bathroom. It is certainly an achievement of direction and style, but it is less shocking than the chainsaw scene of ""Scarface"", plus it follows the same pattern: the pool scene, like the chainsaw, are disconnected from the film, with the sole purpose of generating a ""Wow! "" scene; plus we again find mafia scams who want to kill their main stockistsAnd like ""Scarface 1983"", the film is long, full of easily editable sequences: for example the appearance of Viggo Mortensen seems a desperate cameo for the actor to appear in the movie. The OFF voice of Pacino is good, although it is packed with some Pop psychology about urban life rather than a true reflection of his redemption. But despite the errors, the script and De Palma are responsible for a great moments. Pacino's relationship with Penelope Ann Miller is felt, even with some nonsense (Pacino goes to a home roof, with a trash can lid on his head to cover from the rain, watching his beloved) and the fact that De Palma costs to move to another instance (which makes the romance consume unnecessary minutes). For its part, the script adds sophistication to Carlito Brigante: this is a smart guy who knows the actions of the mob. Pacino performance in the drama is excellent: in the pool scene for example, Pacino's face in the first moments warns us that something is wrong here; and other scenes we can also discover more of his interpretation (when Penn appoints the boat in front of Miller). About style, De Palma sometimes tuned to ""The Untouchables"" and is generally pretty good, but suffers from excessive expressionism: Not all camera movements and angle distortions are subtle. However, in his honor point out the sequence of persecution in the terminal, which is even more tense than the defaulter tribute ""Battleship Potemkin"" in ""The Untouchables""(Warning: Spoilers in this paragraph) And while the film is fairly good (even the non-gangster Carlito Brigante nature of his redemption can justify some numbers: eg supposedly prestigious and millionaires mobsters using only a few thugs, ahem), the film decides to commit a suicide in almost end.

Seing it's a 7.9/10 (at the time I'm writing this) gangster movie with Al Pacino, I expected a solid gangster flick, but not to be thrilled. My expectations were exceeded and I got more than I bargained for. The IMDb description for the movie is pretty spot-on so I think there's no need for me to retell the story, I just want to say that if you liked Heat (1995) and Scarface (1983) you'll like this, it feels like it had the elements of both those movies. The ending is especially thrilling, I'm not someone who gets all jumpy during a movie but here I did.",Carlito's Way

You'll probably like watching this cool old gangster's every move, even his masculine face, covered with beard. I especially like the scenes, when Carlito Brigante and his pretty woman shout at each other -- blame his fate. The film contains some crazy chasing, mad shooting scenes, and sometimes passionate and touching love scenes. However, it's obvious that Carlito Brigante, as a changed man, can't get out of mess whatever he tries. He doesn't want any trouble, but somehow trouble finds him. -- Well, you must see the whole film, to understand what I mean.To summon up, I have to claim that, what we have here is a really good film, that I can watch again and again.",Carlito's Way
192,targetmrktng,American Classic,9,4 December 2006,"Carlito's Way is basically the second installment of Scarface. For the most part, this movie is the follow up. Instead of the drug lord being killed, he decides to go legit. While on the road to going legit, Carlito(Pacino), find out that its harder than he thought to escape the person he was and the life he had previously led. After several run-ins with the law, drug gangs, and the mafia, Carlito is running out of time to achieve his final dream. This movie shows you Carlito's trials and tribulations on that road. A film VERY much like Scarface in almost every aspect, but more refined with less violence and vulgar language. Even for the most hardcore ""gangsta"" fans, you will enjoy the acting, dialog, and screen shots in this film. One of my all time favorites.",Carlito's Way

Not only that but this is not just a mindless gangster movie with your general lashings of glamorised violence it is a terrific story of a guy who has dug deep found some morals and wants to set right the things of the past and leave all that criminality behind.De palmas direction is at his usual fast paced action style to my mind he is such an underrated director, and even though Al Pacinos performance is great I get the feeling that this is Sean Penns film he plays what can only be described as a piece of well you know what I'm driving at . To sum up great story brilliant setting and to compliment this the soundtrack is so good and mixed into the background perfectly .This is a truly underrated film I personally cannot understand why it is not at least in the top 250 it should reside somewhere there",Carlito's Way

Instead, a landslide majority of his films have been exercises in waste production.  This one, however, projects DePalma in the way he SHOULD have been with his years of experience; it is fast, brilliant, excellently acted (the ONLY reason Pacino wasn't nominated for an Oscar in my opinion was the fact that he had won it the previous year...and what's with the Academy not nominating this for best picture?  Ok, there was Schindler's List, but still...) and for once DePalma deserved an Oscar nomination for best direction.  Pretty much a perfect movie.",Carlito's Way

Although it's not as good as Scarface (1983), it still is beautifully crafted and directed, with an amazing cast. A basic summary of the movie is Al Pacino, Carlito gets out of prison after five years and is so delighted.  That's why he vows to never sell drugs or anything else ever again. If you haven't seen the movie, you have got to see it.  I suggest watching Scarface (1983), then watching Carlito's Way (1993).

Although kind of dry in some parts of the movie it more than makes up for it in the end. Pacino has yet another excellent role but this time as an ex-drug kingpin. Penn his once by the book now turned crook lawyer carries a lot of weight as well as a great supporting actor. It is almost cut and dry if you like drugs, crime,or cash movies watch this film! Once again I'm going to have to say this is one of the best movies made in the early 90's ( see Boyz N The Hood review). Pacino still showing he can turned out a classic even with a few miles on.

It is too long, and the ending does not hang together because there's no way that the cops would not have shut down Grand Central. If Carlito was willing to kill in the opening scenes of the movie why wouldn't he have taken care of Benny in the club? These mistakes are in the minor category. Pacino is really good in this, he holds something back, letting you look inside him rather than screaming in your face, as in Scarface and Heat. Penn is beautifully slimy, the atmosphere reeks of 70's New York City, in fact the city seems to be a character in the movie. Penelope Ann Miller is heartbreakingly sad in a thankless role. I find myself watching the movie more than once in spite of its flaws.If you are looking a cool movie with good performances, this is a good choice.",Carlito's Way

200,gusdanjaq,underrated perfect film,10,11 March 2010,"This has to be one of the most unfairly underrated film in movie history. It's a perfect film, and much better than any other De Palma film (I am a big fan of De Palma but this film is just perfect). Ex-drug dealer Carlito Brigante, recently released from prison, tries to live a decent live while dealing with the ever present temptations of going back to it's old one (mostly from his friends, who aren't very happy with the idea of Carlito becoming a decent citizen). He is always accompanied by his best friend and lawyer David Kleinfeld, who is a coke addicted and increasingly paranoid lawyer with dubious connections in the mob world. As you can see, with friends like these it would be a hard job for Carlito to abandon his old life. However he finds strength and inspiration to continue his efforts of cleaning his act by reuniting with his old love (from before he went to jail) Gail. This story is a perfect thriller whose structure and development feels a lot like a Greek tragedy reinterpreted as a film noir. There are few action sequences, but the dialog is so perfect that you just want to know more and more about the characters. The few action sequences are beautifully filmed, and i assure you: you will not be disappointed, they will keep you on the edge of your seat. The performances are great, Pacino gives a great Humphrey Bogart-like performance as the ex-con always tormented by his past (the narration is also great, it clearly shows us how Carlito is feeling, and how i think an ex-con would think trying to clean his act with temptations in every corner). Sean Penn gives an academy award worthy performance by giving a believable approach to Carlito's increasingly drug addicted, paranoid and even homicidal lawyer. The beautiful Penelope Ann Miller gives us a wonderful performance as Carlito's only positive influence and inspiration in his life (I think this performance should have established her as strong leading lady, but as i said, this movie doesn't have even half of the recognition it deserves). All in all, Is a great movie, and personally, one of my all time favorites (if not favorite). Great Performances, Perfect Film.",Carlito's Way

202,hornany,the Pacino/DePalma combination works yet again.,9,3 January 2006,"To me, this movie has always been a kind of SCARFACE 2. I like to think that if Tony Montana were incarcerated and got off, this would be his movie. It has some good acting, some good directing, and as always with DePalma, lavish visuals and interesting camera usage. I found this movie to be profoundly detached from other movies of the general genre. Even though its a pretty common story, the execution through which this movie was made was fresh and interesting. The city, the drama, the violence, all captured well on both the written page and the screen. I found that everybody fit their roles with the exception of Penelope Ann-Miller. She didn't overact so much as lack the needed prescence for the character. She wasn't holding the screen with Pacino, and damn it, as the female love interest, she better. But things like that are minor contrivances to the great movie that is Carlitos Way. The action was well orchestrated, and the character interplay consistent. I felt that the best cast character of ANYONE in the movie, the role that was inseparable from the actor who portrayed it, was Sean Penn's Klienfeld. Beautifully acted, the whole time, you just want to punch the seedy little bastard in the face. The fact that i don't like Sean Penn too much as an actor says my liking for the role. So yeah, i felt it was a 9. But only because Penelope Ann Millers performance brought the movie down.",Carlito's Way

With the firm conviction of staying out of trouble to avoid prison again, Carlito faces many enemies who want him back in the joint: other drug dealers, the district attorney Norwalk, and even his lawyer. He also bought a disco to collect $70.000 and leave to the ""paradise"" island of Bahamas with his beloved woman Gail. Based on a novel by Puerto Rican author Edwin Torres, the movie brings back to life the Spanish Bronx in the 70s brilliantly, with all its mafia, corruption, and action. Many of its characters are impressively complicated, like Charlie, Kleinfeld, Lalin Díaz (Viggo Mortensen), and dangerous capo Benny Blanco from the Bronx (John Leguizamo).

206,manubezamat,A different kind of gangster,10,13 May 2008,"Most people don't highlight 'Carlito's Way' among Al Pacino's gangster movies, but in my opinion it's an instant classic. It's not as hyped as 'The Godfather' or 'Scarface', but it's an extremely honest and captivating film, that wins you over exactly because it doesn't seem to have been created to make it into film history.All the characters are very well defined, so there are no ambiguous or contradicting behaviors. Al Pacino is extremely charismatic, convincing the viewer that as well as he can play an Italian or a cuban, he can play a puerto-rican. And his complete change from one character to another is what makes this movie so special among the other great gangster movies.Carlito Brigante is a more mature gangster, reformed from his years spent in jail. Differently from Tony Montana, Carlito doesn't feel, or needs to feel isolated. He reaches out to the people around him. He wants to trust, and mainly, love. Gail, his love interest, is put on a pedestal, as the person with whom he wants to escape to 'paradise', and the entire film revolves around the expectations and the hope that the viewer feels for this romance that along with Carlito's way out of the crime world would lead them both to the dream life. If Michael Corleone's essence was in honor and Tony Montana's in money, Carlito Brigante's is in this sensitivity, that make's you forget about his ethnicity or his background, which isn't so in 'Scarface'. His body language and his looks as a Latin-American also change amazingly compared to Tony Montana.The supporting actors were also amazing, mainly Sean Penn, that really embraced his character, Kleinfeld, a stressed-out, corrupt lawyer, who betrays everyone around him. John Leguizamo is also great as 'Benny from the Bronx'.Overall the film is very well paced, as it begins with a bit of action, when Carlito returns to his neighbourhood, goes on revolving around him getting his life back on track and making plans with Gail, and ends with the thrilling and greatly edited scenes of the Grand Central Station chase. Finally, when he's shot, you're left wondering if there was any way out to begin with, and if there's really a possibility of 'paradise', even for a reformed gangster like himself.",Carlito's Way
207,aaronalmarez,"The ""so-called"" sequel to Scarface",9,20 December 2012,"Just like ""Casino"" has been considered the ""so-called"" sequel to ""Goodfellas"", in my opinion, ""Carlito's Way"" is basically the ""so-called"" sequel to ""Scarface."" The reasons for that explanation is because of the stars and similar story lines of each movie. With ""Goodfellas"" and ""Casino"", both movies starred Robert De Niro and Joe Pesci and were directed by Martin Scorsese. When it comes to both ""Scarface"" and ""Carlito's Way"", both movies star Al Pacino and were directed by Brian De Palma. And even actors that played minor roles in one movie appear in some capacity in their counterparts. Also in the past, there were weekends were I would watch both sets of movies together but on separate days from each other. But of course, there are differences between ""Tony Montana"" and ""Carlito Brigante."" ""Tony Montana"" was basically a Cuban refugee hoodlum who along with other Cuban refugees, arrives in Miami, Florida during the ""Mariel Boat Lift"" in 1980 and within a few years becomes the top drug lord in Miami and uses cocaine as a source of power. But that particular drug also contributes to his downfall in the end. With ""Carlito Brigante"", he's a Nuyorican(Puerto Rican New Yorker) ex drug lord who returns to the streets of New York City in 1975 after serving 5 years of a 30 year prison sentence. Now planning to live a legitimate crime free life, he also tries to rekindle his relationship with Gail(Penelope Ann Miller) that he had before his imprisonment. But there are two causes to Carlito's downfall. The first is his lawyer, David Kleinfeld(Sean Penn)who not only has a very bad cocaine addiction but is corrupt and is also a retaliatory target of incarcerated Italian mob boss, Tony ""Tony T"" Taglialucci(Frank Minucci), another one of his clients. Carlito's second downfall is ""Benny Blanco"" who is a young, inexperienced punk who is trying to rise up in the drug trade by trying to surpass Carlito and is played by actor/comedian John Leguizamo, respectively. But in the end, is it Carlito himself that contributes to his downfall just for having a loyal trust in Kleinfeld and Pachanga(Luis Guzman), an old friend from his past. ""Carlito's Way"" was released in 1993 for which it was 10 years apart from ""Scarface""(which was released in 1983). And another difference between each movie is the musical score. With ""Scarface"", the score was conducted by Giorgio Moroder and was synthesizer based. With ""Carlito's Way"", the score was conducted by Patrick Doyle and was more symphonic/orchestra based. But the soundtrack also consisted of songs from 1970's Disco groups such as KC and the Sunshine Band, The O Jays, The Hues Corporation, The Bee Gees, LaBelle, etc. that fit the time period of the movie(1975). And the soundtrack also consisted of songs from Latin music artists such as Celia Cruz, Hector Lavoe, Willie Colon, and Santana as well. And besides the other aforementioned actors, the other actors that comprised the cast such as James Rebhorn, Viggo Mortensen, Adrian Pasdar, Joseph Siravo, Richard Foronjy, John Ortiz, Ingrid Rogers and the late Argentinian comedic actor, Jorge Porcel(in his only American acting appearance) also put in good performances in this movie. And besides Al Pacino, other ""Scarface"" alumni such as Al Israel(Hector), Angel Salazar(Chi Chi), Cesar Cordova(Cuban cook), and Mike Moran(Nick the Pig)also make brief cameos in ""Carlito's Way."" Just like he perfected the Cuban accent for ""Tony Montana"" in ""Scarface"", Pacino perfects the Nuyorican accent for ""Carlito Brigante"" in ""Carlito's Way"", even if he is an Italian-American actor. Although ""Carlito's Way: Rise to Power"" was, in my opinion, a good prequel starring Jay Hernandez as a young ""Carlito"" in his early years, it will never compare to the original film from 1993. ""Carlito's Way"", in my opinion, is another great gangster film that should be included in the ranks with ""The Godfather"" trilogy, ""Once Upon a Time in America"", ""Goodfellas"", ""Casino"", ""A Bronx Tale"", and of course, ""Scarface""(both versions from 1932 and 1983/Al Pacino respectively). Also, look out for a director's trademark that director Brian De Palma left in both movies that involves a gun that includes a silencer and an arm in a sling. Of course, both ""Scarface"" and ""Carlito's Way"" have to be watched together side by side to find that director's trademark along with its symbolism.",Carlito's Way

Amazing performance by Sean Penn, who really carries the film forward despite the powerhouse presence of the great Al Pacino. The characters were very well written and performed beautifully, especially from the less know (at the time) Vigo Mortensen and John Leguizamo.While this can be considered a ""gangster movie"", the love story of Carlito and Gale serve as the perfect motivation for the title character to escape the street life.

Al did a great job in not making Carlito resemble Tony Montana at all. I read in an interview that it was actually Al who suggested that Carlito have a beard as to not make the movie seem like a Scarface sequel. I liked how there were some scenes where Al casually used Spanish slang that you would only know if you were Puerto Rican or heavily studied Puerto Rican slang (eg. mi pana (buddy) being tossed about during many of the scenes with other Spanish speakers). It was nice how a movie that was set in New York was actually filmed on location, and the last scene was a highlight on that. 10/10, will be buying this soon to add to my collection of favorite movies.",Carlito's Way

213,movie-monster,"Gritty, authentic and moving crime thriller that surpasses Scarface",9,22 May 2014,"Carlitos Way (1993) marked the second cinematic collaboration of director Brian de Palma and Al Pacino, the first being Scarface (1983). As a result the films often draw many comparisons, especially since they are both stories concerning the rise and fall of two charismatic immigrant criminals, both trying desperately to live out their own contrasting visions of the American Dream. While Scarface is now quite rightly considered one of the finest gangster films of the 1980's, in '83 this was not the case. It was critically slammed on release, and its a testament to its ambitious approach to illustrating the drug trade, and Pacino's iconic, unforgettable, almost career-defining performance as Tony Montana, that it has earned such a massive cult following since. Carlito's Way, by comparison, is completely overlooked, and something of a forgotten gem. Pacino's character, Carlito Brigante, is infinitely more likable than the explosive, irrational and ultimately paranoid & treacherous Montana. Its clear from one of the opening scenes in a courtroom, where Brigante is acquitted somewhat miraculously of all charges laid against him. He takes the opportunity to deliver a speech to the court, about how he is a reformed character and a changed man. Deep down he genuinely wants nothing more than to keep his head down, destroy his association with organised crime, and earn enough money in a straight job so he can move to the Caribbean. His lawyer and close friend played by Sean Penn, laughs at this suggestion. His character, by contrast, is a spineless coke-fuelled snake, who respects no-one and betrays Carlito's trust several times in the film. He continues to get on the wrong side of characters you should never cross, and Carlito repeatedly bails him out.Brigante is clearly very streetwise, with Pacino narrating much of the film in first person, and giving a fascinating insight into the mind of an ex-con, whose determined to go straight, despite the continued pressure from those around him, many of whom consider him something of a legend. There is not one scene in this film where the audience can consider him anything less than an genuine, honest, loyal and decent guy. Ironically, its Brigante's own morals and desire never to kill again that seal his fate. Later in the film, street justice is served ice cold, and his demise is as tragic as it is inevitable. Brian De Palmas unique cinematic style serves this film particularly well, with countless memorable tracking shots, the highlight of which has to be the railway station chase scene at the end. One of the most gripping, tense and suspenseful moments of any film I've ever seen.Carlitos Way is a long film, at almost 3 hours, but it passes by in a blur. No scene is too long or too unnecessary, they all serve to paint a vivid and convincing picture of the world these characters inhabit. In Brigante, Pacino portrays a character with dreams and ambitions, that to many seemed far fetched or even absurd, and that despite his honesty and loyalty, he is betrayed by almost everyone close to him, though ultimately he was still a good guy, who only wanted what was best for himself, his girlfriend and his unborn child. He wanted desperately to escape from the violent, cruel world in which he grew up, but it was a part of him, and he couldn't outrun his own past. In the final scene I was on the edge of my seat, praying Brigante would make it to the train, knowing deep in the back of my mind, that it wouldn't happen. In Scarface, the conclusion felt justified: Montana had betrayed people, he killed his best friend in cold blood, warped the innocent mind of his younger sister, and gets gunned down in his own mansion by a hit-squad, while 'high on his own supply.' Brigante, on the other hand, just didn't deserve it. It is simply the most moving ending to any film I have ever seen. I literally burst into tears. This is what makes the conclusion to this movie so devastating and powerful; it defies Hollywood convention. In spite of his past, and the errors of his ways, in the end the good guy dies. When he was so, so close to breaking free...",Carlito's Way

One cannot help but to shiver for him at the end during the long and riveting runaway sequence in the underground, one that I managed to see quite a lot of times, and every time a part of me still believes that it's going to be all right, he'll get out of a life of betrayal, small crooks and cons, but he ends up getting killed, as the introduction scene shows it. De Palma's direction is once again inspired, especially when Carlito looks at his love interest under the rain, hiding from a it under a garbage can, watching her dance or during the action sequences. It's probably DePalma's film with the most obvious references to Hitchcock or Welles. (the snooker scene is just brilliant).

This film is so breath taking that I could watch it over and over in spite of its running time. I do think this is as good as classic mob movies like Goodfellas, The Godfather, Casino, or Hawks'Scarface. This is also a very moving flick. Each time I see the ending I cry, because it's so beautiful. Carlito's Way represents the sunset of the mob, like Unforgiven was the sunset of the West.

Full of cliché predictable scenes and a jukebox soundtrack that make it a shame Shaun Penn had anything to do with this, someone whom ordinarily I hold in high regard. And there was nothing wrong with his performance in this. I'm convinced that the more times you watch this film, the more it'll begin to irritate you.**SPOILER** There is one or two delightful very memorable scenes however in my opinion. Firstly, when he's ran out of ammunition in the toilets, and secondly when Penn is sick onto the fence looking out onto the harbour.This film is text book, gangster film for the sake of a gangster film (A genre I usually try to avoid at all costs). Poor dialogue, coo-coo land fantasy plot lines, and probably it's most effective drawback is that it's made a mockery thanks to the terrible casting choices of ham extras and jobbing rent-a-crowds (Who are employed ad infinitum in an abundance of scenes).I get the feeling that sometimes whilst watching Paccino in this film, that even he wishes he'd never got involved.Pay close attention to the extras, it'll ruin this film for you.

218,dronhak,"This film can be called ""poetry in motion""",10,8 January 2004,"It is really unfair telling the story of the film, because it sounds so banal and familiar, that many viewers (including many critics) just skipped it. Otherwise I cant explain why this really magnificent film was most underrated.When I first saw this movie, I just knew that I want to see it again, immediately. I Saw it 3 Times in the theatre (a week interval between each other)and each time I was more and more convinced that this was the best film ever (I still think so 10 years after).What made me love this film so much is that it is much much better than its ingredients, which are praise for themselves. The story line is much complex, interesting and surprising than it sounds in the beginning. We know at the beginning how it ends, but the ""story telling"" is so delicious and thrilling that knowing the end just adds to our involvement with the protagonist. The acting of all the cast (Pacino, penn and Ann Miller, Guzman, Leugziamo and mortensen) is like Carlito says ""Top drawer"". The music scores and the seventies era illustrated in this film made me very nostalgic and allegic. The real hero of this film is De Palma. He seems to make this masterpiece effortlessly, combining great action and horror scenes (which he masters without a competition) with surprisingly tender and touching love scenes. It seems like he winks at us, as to say ""If I wanted to, I could have bit Coppola or Scorsese in their playground without sweat""",Carlito's Way

221,Joecool1-1,Carlito's Way is one of Pacino's most underrated films,9,15 June 2010,"The actors in this film are outstanding, from Pacino & Sean Penn to Penelope Ann Miller & an early John Leguizamo this film sports an outstanding cast. Brian De Palma is also in fine form here as he directs this movie seemingly without effort and with his usual unique (these days) style. The film is a seen as a sequel of sorts to Scarface, but saying that does Carlito's Way an injustice. Carlito's Way stands apart and on it's own very well. The world in this film is fascinating to behold, a bit of mob, a character wanting to reform, a love story and an action story. Also Pacino has a lot of nice sayings in this film. If Scarface is a 10 then Carlito's Way should be a 9. This film has been too underrated for far too long, it's time justice was done which is why I gave it the deserving 9 stars.

222,aaamail,"Great movie, good party scenes, sympathetic portrayal the gridlocked city life",7,18 October 2017,"Carlitos way is about inner city people trying to make it in a cruel a ruthless competition for money and power. Following both a street thug and a morally bankrupt star lawyer the movie portrays human beings from different social classes each trying their best to make against the backdrop of the coke and crime ridden urban environment of the 70's USA. Al Pacino gives Carlitos warmth. He stands out as a sympathetic guy trapped in a game of honor codes and eye-for-eye mentality, while Sean Penn shines as a the highly educated and cynical chess player, while also coming off as being ridiculous and pathetic. Sean Penns dance moves are hilarious. This movie is remembered for the tension between the sympathetic yet slightly grotesque portrayal of 70/80 coke parties and crime fests, like movies from Scorcese. Everyone seems locked in to their destiny and despite trying to skew it ends up on their chosen path. Just like the movies title alludes to.Like Scarface the movie features some of the best and most ridiculous cocaine party scenes, complete with old business men dancing and prancing with sweaty foreheads and near heart attack looking moves.",Carlito's Way
223,Gav-19,One of THE Greatest Gangster Movies of All Time,10,18 December 2001,"Since making his name for his role as Sonny in 1975's Dog Day Afternoon, Al Pacino has grown into of one the pre-eminent actors of his or any time. The Godfather trilogy, Scent of a Woman and Heat punctuate a golden filmography for the charismatic Puerto Rican, but it is in one of his lesser-known films, Carlito's Way, that Pacino gives one of his most impressive performances.Brian De Palma, who directed Pacino in Scarface, chooses to begin his film at the end, which allows him to use the eponymous Carlito himself as narrator. In the opening sequences we see Carlito released from jail on a technicality 5 years into a 25-year sentence for narcotics smuggling. He is intent on going straight, but a corrupt lawyer and his old drugs cronies among other elements stand in the way of his dream, an `escape to paradise.'Loyalty is the most profound theme the film explores, as Carlito's anachronistic code of honour and the resuming of his relationship with Miller, after a 5-year hiatus, dominate the picture.Carlito's Way is a film that will largely appeal to a male audience, as it explores a man's adjustment to a changed world, and his one-mindedness in attempting to escape that cruel world. That world, late-1970s New York, is well created in the picture, with an early disco soundtrack doing much to craft that setting. There is terrific range in De Palma's movie: the set-pieces are highly memorable, the script, adapted from two Edwin Torres novels very sharp, and Miller is adequate as the necessary love interest. Pacino is as charismatic as he ever has been, delivering his lines with characteristic flair.Carlito's personal narration, which gives the viewers insight into his hopes, fears, mistakes and dreams, ensures that Carlito's Way will have universal appeal. Excellent.***** (5 Stars)",Carlito's Way
224,ROBL-2,"Forget Penn & Teller..... Penn & Pacino, what a performance",10,7 July 2001,"This film was not well publicised to my mind in England. What was happening when this film was released so that it went un-noticed? I'm not going to say much other than it's a tough (but thoroughly warmhearted) gangster movie. Set in the mid seventies, I suppose that I do get a bit nostalgic but whether you weren't around then or didn't like the ""disco"" era you'll find the performances of Pacino & Penn rise far far above any distractions.
The story itself, written by an American judge that had a tough upbringing, is the final piece of a brilliant whole movie. Where were the awards for this film? Yes you could criticise the slightly weak performance of one of the other main characters but.....no. 10 out of 10",Carlito's Way
225,Tokur,Don't miss this!,10,15 May 2006,"Carlito Brigante is an ex-drug-lord who has just been released from prison, and has vowed to go legitimate. However, when he revisits his old neighborhood, all of his past memories come back to haunt him in a flash, starting with a shootout in the back of a barber shop. Director Brian De Palma ('Scarface') teams up with Al Pacino ('The Godfather' films) once again to film this movie, and it works. Unlike Scarface, Carlito's Way had much more of a smooth flow that tells a story without too much violence in it, and what Carlito was trying to do to get away from his past. Every minute of the film is gold. The performances are the key in this movie, and every performer is great with their role. To me, the one that stood out the most was Sean Penn's ('21 Grams') character because it showed just how his character could change in a matter of time. He was the most convincing character in the movie. This film also gave John Leguizamo ('Ice Age 1 & 2') better recognition as an actor. Overall, this is a classic film of the crime genre, and should not be overlooked. -- (10/10)",Carlito's Way

227,pinturicchio_juve,Pacino works his magic yet again!,10,11 May 2013,"I just love Brian De Palma films. They're just so good to watch and have the right mix of good dialogues and an appealing storyline to get the viewer hooked. Scarface and The Untouchables would serve as worthy examples to this fact, and now that I've watched it, I guess Carlito's Way does too. The film is an adaptation of Edwin Torres' novel ""After Hours"" which follows the story of ex-con/gangster/drug peddler Carlito Brigante (played by Al Pacino), who tries to shun away from a life of crime after being released from prison. Brigante had in actuality been serving a thirty-to-life sentence, which had gotten reduced to five years, owing to the influence his lawyer, David Kleinfeld (Sean Penn) had with the jury. Once out on the streets, Carlito pledges to live life the right way and reluctantly agrees to co-own a nightclub so that he can save just enough money to leave New York and start a car rental business. But inevitably, he's lured into crime once again, and how he fights the odds forms the rest of the plot.One thing that struck me as I watched the film was that everything was very direct. There is not really much for the audience to interpret. Each character is sketched out quite well at the beginning itself, and one kind of knows what he/she would tend to do under the given circumstances. For example, Sean Penn's character, David Kleinfeld is exposed as a corrupt lawyer, and subsequent events throughout the film show him as one, with all his shady dealings and money laundering activities coming back to haunt him. I liked this about the movie, because one is not left wondering what a particular scene means, or what that character was trying to say. Its all said and done. There. Take it or leave it. Of course, this kind of storytelling will not work in all situations, but here, it feels just right. Then there's that aura of the gangster about Carlito. In the beginning, he accompanies his cousin to a drug dealer's hangout for a transaction. As the scene develops, one can feel Carlito sensing that there's something amiss about the place. The tension is brilliantly captured by De Palma here and you can just feel Pacino getting into the skin of the gangster he's portraying. He knows exactly what's going to happen, he's prepared for it, and when it does happen, he knows what to do. This gut instinct comes to the fore in the latter half of the film as well and is part of the reason why this films works for me.There are a lot of scenes and characters which contribute to making the film what it is, such as John Leguizamo as ""Benny Blanco"" the young upstart who tries to get chummy with Carlito but fails, Gail, Carlito's former lover, with whom he rekindles his relationship and Luiz Guzman as ""Pachanga"", Carlito's right hand man. But to me, this one is Pacino all the way. He carries the film on his shoulders and commands respect in almost every frame. You can see that he's always in control and this again points to the direct nature of the storyline. The De Palma-Pacino-gangster plot combine gives rise to obvious comparisons with Scarface. But the two are so different. While Tony Montana is just a drug dealer, Carlito Brigante is much more than that. He's a larger than life personality with a heart, remorse, and a conscience. He believes he has a shot at redemption. Montana has none of this. He's arrogant, ruthless and has absolutely no feelings of guilt or regret. The differing nature of their characters make the two films widely different, thus making a comparison would just be a wasteful exercise. The climax sequence, shot at a railway station does bring back scenes reminiscent of The Untouchables, though the events that unfold in the two films are entirely different.Carlito's Way might have its share of flaws which may not put it in the league of gangster flicks such as Goodfellas or The Godfather movies, but it is still a classic, and a highly underrated one at that. De Palma himself is a hugely underrated director (It is a surprise to me how he hasn't won an Oscar yet), and this film just underlines his capability. This one's a must watch for all fans of mob films, but I think that at its very basic level, it's just a story about a man with a heart.",Carlito's Way
228,batterypark123,Like Al Pachino,6,28 August 2017,"Where Scarface was about a South American battling his way to the top of the crime world, Carlito's Way is about a South American gangster trying to leave his past behind him. The story is very good and believable, the problems for Carlito (Al Pacino) are very typical for someone in his position and the relationships are all very convincing. The fact that Edwin Torres based his characters on real people and that events in the film are inspired by real life, really help Carlito's Way to be a credible film. The fact that it is Carlito's lawyer, Kleinfeld (Sean Penn), who got him out of prison and then becomes a loose cannon who provides Carlito with too many problems is a great illustration of respect and excess going to someone's head.The performances in this film are extremely strong. Al Pacino is one of the best actors ever to be witnessed and is on outstanding form here. The beard, shades and long coat are a very good look for him and definitely provide him with one of his most fashionable roles to date. What is most convincing in this performance is his charm towards Gail (Penelope Ann Miller) as the audience, along with Gail, fall for him instantly, despite knowing his past. His scenes with Sean Penn are also amongst the films strong points because it always good to see Pacino act angry. The dialogue between these two is exceptional and really highlights how strongly Carlito's Way is written. Sean Penn does not let Pacino outclass him and gives one of his strongest performances. As an arrogant coke head, Penn portrays a character who is really repulsive and dislikeable and incites a great sense of hatred from the audience. Penelope Ann Miller does well to give the film feeling and bring it down to earth. It is pleasurable to watch her inner conflicts regarding Carlito as she pulls off the emotional scenes very professionally and is very effective at drawing out an emotional response from the audience. Luis Guzman and John Leguizamo are the two most memorable characters from the supporting cast, they both fit specific niches very well and both give great performances. It was nice to see Adrian Pasdar in the film, shame he wasn't in it for longer as the writers could have made something more out of his character.My only negative criticism of the film is that it could have done with a touch more action. Gangster films are at their most exciting when there is a high drama shootout but Carlio's Way only has two major action scenes. Luckily, the content is good enough to make up for this. The two shootouts are very good scenes, especially the last one as the tension build up is so intense.Stylish, realistic and stimulating, Carlito's Way would be a classic gangster film, had it not been overshadowed and over compared to Scarface. All the ingredients are right to serve up a fantastic film.",Carlito's Way
229,milanbaros_948,The greatest redemption movie ever!,9,28 August 2005,"De Palma, De Palma, De Palma. Although Brian is a brilliant director little lapses in foresight often stop 10 star movies gaining top marks. The first time I saw this movie I missed the first 10 minutes but caught on quickly, I was familiar with Gangster redemption tales and this seemed to fit in with those. The movie really captured me with the snooker 'trick shot' scene and for the rest of the film I was hooked. By the time I had reached the ending I had grown to care for Carlito Brigante immensely and was extremely tense in the getaway scene. Every close call i was rubbing sweat off my palms. I truly wanted this character to escape his inevitable(?) doom. At last I thought he had made it and was literally jumping for the air when the killer shock comes...Carlito is killed by a two-bit punk I had forgotten about 'Benny Blanco from the Bronx'. The shock hit me hard and I was deeply moved by Pacino's monologue. The credits rolled and I had been exhilarated and moved by this story ad would straight-away have given it 10 stars.However, last night I saw the movie was on and set a reminder, I saw the movie from the start...big mistake. The opening credits are a montage of shots from the end sequence, totally taking the shock away from the ending, moving the surprise from Carlito dying, to who killed him which makes the impact of the last scene seriously dampened. If you know from the start he does not make it you have lessened your enjoyment considerably.Never-the-less this movie is still must see despite De Palmas idiotic mistake of the opening credits his style remains and several shots are breathtaking. Pacino is at his usual best, one look with those eyes out-acts any Tom Hanks or Tom Cruise performance. Just cut the opening credits if you make a directors cut Brian...pleeeeeaaaassseee!",Carlito's Way
230,timothy-devereux,Carlito the Pragmatic Gangster!,9,10 September 2013,"DePalma's film is a masterpiece on many levels. For one, it is historically accurate to the letter. Carlito, a former smack peddler, is released from prison after a few years. When released, the drug business has changed. Cocaine, rather than heroine, is the drug of choice for most New Yorkers. It is more expensive and much more widely used than heroine. Before Cocaine, drug dealers were guys who operated on the fringes of society and catered to artists and musicians. In addition, Heroine was relatively cheap compared to Coke. This was the world Carlito was used to in the 50's and 60's. Yet he was somehow able to make a name for himself in this parched landscape through toughness, street smarts and pragmatism.Now released from prison, he finds out that the dope business changed while he was on the inside. Cocaine is easily available and in high demand. Drug users are now part of mainstream society. They include young professionals, politicians and athletes. As a result, drug dealers are not only able to make more money, they also become celebrities in their own right. This was so true about New York in the 1970's. Guys like Nikki Barnes made the cover of magazines because of Coke. It was ridiculous. Another important issue to point out is the escalating violence that results as well. Because Coke is more expensive, dealers are able to buy more guns from the windfall profits. DePalma does an excellent job incorporating this into a generation gap issue between Carlito and the newer criminals. Carlito is a killer and a thug. But he killed for survival. Perhaps his mothers death when he was young gave him more respect for human life or his generation as a whole valued life more than the new generation of gangsters. Carlito was born in a time when many people did not survive childhood. Some women still died during childbirth. World Wars also took the lives of many men. Since the new generation didn't experience death like he did, they value human life less. More guns in circulation feeds the beast of indifference. Pachanga said it best: ""They shotgun you just to see you fly up in the air"".Overall, a great movie with a tragic ending. The movie incorporates many themes about living a life of crime, changing social attitudes and capitalism. Highly recommended.",Carlito's Way
231,bener1hannover,An underrated masterpiece from the Scarface-duo,10,23 January 2006,"After seen it several times, I must admit it gets better every time you watch it. I think the beginning was a nice little trick to make the film more unpredictable. The ending is very sad and ""satisfying"" at once. It's one of the best endings I have ever seen!Pacino gives a great performance as Carlito Brigante who wants to start a new life and try to get his big love back after he has served 5 years in prison and had a life full of crime, drugs and murder. He wants to open a car-rental business and needs money to start it. But he can't get out of the vicious circle of his old friends! The real star of the movie is Sean Penn, who gives an Oscar worthy performance as Brigantes perfidious lawyer David Kleinfeld. I must say all of the actors gave a great performance, especially Penelope Ann Miller as Gail! The cinematography is very well done. Especially the scene when he is in the bathroom, after his cousin gets killed and he shoots the 3 guys at the pool-table (which also is the DVD-cover)! Then, of course the magnificent ending/opening shot and another good example is the chase in the station!

245,jon-551,"""I know a Puerto Rican when I see one"" -- Chris Rock",2,19 February 2005,"I'm shocked to see this film so well-reviewed, but seeing all the thumbs up on this site I do have to acknowledge the good points in ""Carlito's Way"". It's true that Pacino and Penn are two of the best American film actors ever, and their work in this film, as well as DePalma's effort as Director, does deserve praise. Latter day fans of the actors, or fans of Scarface, will see something of a reversal for Penn and Pacino - Pacino is simmering and reserved (complicated in a word, like many of Penn's pre- and post- ""Fast Times"" roles), and Penn is the bombastic psycho, a la Pacino's Tony Montana. And DePalma shows his technical and visual expertise, and deft handling of underlying violence, tension, and suspense, in many of the scenes mentioned in other reviews.But part of the reason the three principals here merit some applause, is that the script for this film is awful. It is paint-by-numbers without a shred of humor or irony. Pacino's ""Puerto Rican"" accent is unbelievably bad, as if he were mocking his own role, or if the text of the script were so bad he felt a need to mangle his own delivery. It's even worse than his Cuban accent in Scarface, without the cartoonish humor. Tony Montana couldn't even speak his few Spanish lines convincingly. Carlito sounds like a Cajun with bad gas, not a Puertorriqueño. Also, while I agree with other reviewers that Pacino's physical look in this film makes a big contribution (Penn's even more so), I have never met a Puerto Rican who looked as white as Pacino. Rick Aviles is Puerto Rican. John Leguizamo is half Puerto Rican. Pacino? Not remotely.This flaw is made worse by Pacino's voice over narration - one of my least favorite devices in cinema. The narration is so horribly written, it must have been added after the original cut. On occasion, narration is thus added to a completed film as an afterthought, where the original cut otherwise might seem confusing or incomplete, or to novel adaptations (like this one), to make up for the lack of illuminating backstory or detail. In ""Carlito's Way"", it's simply unnecessary and annoying. The film would have been shorter and better without it. I also agree with other reviewers that the very ""True"" romance between Pacino and Penelope Ann Miller is a departure from other Pacino gangster films, where his character is too unflappable or monomaniacal to be involved in and motivated by any such relationship. And the premise of two lovers who have been tragically separated - and shed some of their narcissism in the process - is compelling. But the pair's actual performances as lovers are childish and irritating. I agree with an earlier review here that the mock rape scene is so ridiculous that it's a chore simply to sit through it.To sum up, the whole cast and the director are excellent, but the script is garbage. Such a combo worked a lot better in ""King of New York"", a far less ambitious film, but one that is more watchable than this one because it sticks to its strengths.",Carlito's Way
246,IMDBcooper1971,"""You think you're just going to sail off into the sunset, @$$hole? Think again.""",9,14 March 2017,"This quote from the film's third act could easily be the tagline for Carlito's Way, one of my favourite films and even a possible contender for my top 10 of all time. It tells the story of Carlito Brigante, a former criminal on early release, and his attempts to leave his past life, despite pretty much everyone around him dragging him back.It's only natural to draw comparisons between this and Scarface, both are crime movies directed by Brian DePalma and starring Al Pacino and in some ways the automatic comparison might be what has hindered this films popularity. Scarface is the more iconic and quotable film (and rightly so) but for my money Carlito's Way is the better film overall; a more mature and contemplative piece. There's a scene in a diner about mid-way through the movie in which Carlito tells Gail""This counsellor in Lewisburg, Mr. Seawald, once said to me: ""Charlie, you run out of steam. You can't sprint all the way. You gotta stop sometime. You can't buck it forever. It catches up to you. It gets you. You don't get reformed, you just run out of wind.""""This felt almost like a direct acknowledgement of Scarface and how this film would differ from it; Tony Montana in Scarface is clearly a character who tried to sprint all the way and ultimately paid for it. Carlito's lived to be older than Montana, he's more world-weary and experienced. In some ways Carlito's Way benefits from the fact Scarface came before it. Montana was petulant, he lived fast and died young. Now DePalma and Pacino present us with a different story, one that takes its time and carries the weight of experience and of maturity.There's several instances where Carlito shrugs off something that would've outraged Montano. Clearly Carlito's the more relaxed of the two, more comfortable in his own skin and less likely to cause a stir when it's unnecessary. Carlito seems tired of who he was in his youth and so he tries to do something different.The main problem with this plan, and the main conflict of the film, is that his departure from who he used to be is far from a clean break. He takes what he tells himself is a temporary job, running a nightclub populated by criminals, many of whom knew him when he was younger or are familiar with his legend. In other words: bad influences. Carlito makes the potentially fatal mistake of trying to be both a semi-gangster and a reformed citizen simultaneously and the end result was always going to be problematic.This very interesting dimension of DePalma's film is brought to the forefront by the character of Benny Blanco, an up-and-coming criminal who Carlito takes a strong dislike to despite the fact a friend tells him ""It doesn't make sense you should hate this guy because this guy is you twenty years ago."" He's essentially the physical manifestation of Carlito's younger self. When Carlito compromises on his no-crime promise and runs the nightclub, Benny is often lurking in the background. He represents Carlito's old life and Carlito now represents the new life he wants, it's only natural conflict should arise between the two. This external conflict between them matches the internal conflict between the two forces inside Carlito. Because he doesn't completely eradicate his younger avatar and instead keeps him around, the past (Benny) ultimately throws the future (Carlito) into severe jeopardy. When Carlito throws Benny out of the club, the two stand illuminated by red light. Blanco's whole face is covered in it; he's fully a gangster, totally at ease with what he is with no internal struggle to rectify. Carlito only has red light on one half of his face, divided exactly in the middle. He's not quite a gangster anymore but he can't quite fully leave it behind. It's this internal struggle that causes so many problems for him.There's also themes about growing older and hopes being dashed. There's a great scene where Carlito goes to see his former girlfriend who he still has feelings for. She tells him she's a dancer, yet, when he goes to see her perform, it turns out she's a stripper. Pacino plays it brilliantly, keyword: nuance. Up until that moment he had thought Gail had achieved her lifelong dream and yet instead he sees it's simply a pale imitation (a storyline that parallels his own). He has his shirt buttoned up to the top but when he enters the club and sees what kind of place it is he unbuttons his top button, adjusting his expectations (as well as demonstrating how easily he can oscillate between the two worlds when really he should stick to one). It's a film about the perceived necessity of compromise but also the dark ramifications of it.The dialogue, and Pacino's delivery, can feel a little cheesy occasionally but, if you let yourself enjoy the film and be invested in the characters, that won't be a problem.Slow in parts, but never boring, when the action scenes arrive they're some of the best you'll see in film (Particularly the chase sequence). DePalma uses long shots for the chase scenes rather than the more traditional quick, excessive jump cuts and the end result proves to be very effective, giving a real sense of peril. IMDb only allows 1,000 words so I can only briefly praise Sean Penn's fantastically seedy character and the excellent soundtrack.Overall, it's an interesting story, exploring a dimension of criminal life that's rarely been explored (and rarer still been explored this effectively). The tragedy of this film is that Carlito just can't shake off his former life, his compromises end with him getting in his own way, which makes for a more human story, even a more relatable one. One of Pacino's best films and the best DePalma film I've seen so far. Great for fans of cinema, directing and characterization.9/10",Carlito's Way

It draws even the most harsh hearted watcher into hoping that Carlito - a character played brilliantly by Al Pacino - will succeed in his struggle against a society where the code of the streets that he grew up with has changed beyond all recognition.

Aside from a few very movingmoments, plus a couple intelligent ones the dialog is lacking, andthe structure is wandering.  The first hour and 20 minutes feelslike 3 hours.

""Carlito's Way"" is an emotional and captivating story, depicting the life of former trug kingpin Carlito Brigante (Pacino). Brigante's intention is to go straight, clean up his act, and make money managing a sleazy nightclub.  David Koepp's screenplay has the depth it needs in examining the intense struggle an ex-druglord must endure when trying to escape his violent past.  Stephen Burum's nearly flawless camerawork and DePalma's flamboyant and operatic direction are a visual splendor that complements the emotional story.  This film is a highly underrated work of art that needs to be appreciated.  Great supporting performances from Sean Penn and Penelope Ann Miller should not go unmentioned.",Carlito's Way
256,cynthiax,Are these sympathy votes and/or simply allegiance to Pacino (et al) talking?,1,12 March 2005,"After wanting to see this film for years, and now finally having done so, disappointed to say that this is one of the worst I've ever seen. I've watched hundreds - thousands - of films, and can really only think of half a dozen or so that I've found to be worse than this. I could tell after the opening monologue/narration that this was going to be comedically horrendous, and only kept watching to see how much worse it might get.Having just sat and read through loads of pages of good reviews here, I cannot work out from where these positive comments are coming. From the first scene to the last, everything about it just seemed utterly ridiculous. The predictability, accents, costumes, set design (how is all of this 1975??), and, perhaps worst of all, the script. Completely over the top, all of it. I couldn't take any of the characters seriously, and simply could not believe what rubbish dialogue they were given to spout. Poor Viggo Mortenson - how can he not be ashamed? ('you no hear?' Please!). Poor everyone...I don't necessarily feel I'm including any spoilers, but have ticked the little box just in case; therefore, to further say: The theme of time/mayhem was slightly clever (ie 'we'll only be in there ten minutes', '30 minutes, tops', and 'i'll be 5 minutes, trust me' - and then of course, madness and violence ensues. But these were all as predictable as a character in a teen horror film saying 'I'll be right back' - we all know what's going to happen. Also found the station/stairs(escalator)/shoot-em-up correlation between this and The Untouchables (also DePalma) to be crossing the 'auteur' line bit too much - I kept waiting for the baby buggy to turn up. Yawn.Speaking of which, I note that in the 'goofs' section here, there is no mention of the moment where, after calling him Charlie (far too many times) in a scene in her apartment, at one point Penelope calls him Tony. And for any caption/subtitle users (I sometimes watch with them, as the house where I live can tend to be loud), in the scene where Pacino, Penn, and Steffie (gal from the bar) are at the posh country house, for one line of Steffie's dialogue, the subtitles mistakenly note that her character is called Gail. Nice.The only almost-remotely, almost-redeeming scene involved a certain peering through an apartment door and a mirror; but even with that, we are given Penelope Ann Miller. Really bizarre choice.In all my years of using IMDb and voting for films, I believe this is the only '1' I've given, and definitely the only review I've felt compelled to post. How can anyone who truly appreciates, say, The Godfather {or insert a standard considered-to-be masterpiece title} put this piece of gunk in the same calibre? I just don't get it...",Carlito's Way
257,Chet Brusk,Solid work on all fronts.,8,25 February 2001,"Recommended by a friend for great performances, this movie nonetheless snuck up on me. Sean Penn disappears into his character, who (visually at least) recalls a younger Gene Hackman. Al Pacino refrains from chewing scenery to deliver a human being trying to shake his past. Very few of the characters fall into familiar stereotypes; each has a real twist.The only disappointment was the main character's voiceover narration, which seemed to deliver over-the-top lines that were incongruous with the rest of the film's believeability.",Carlito's Way
258,phantomdan13,Awesome example of how a gangster film should be,9,7 June 2001,"Carlito's Way is one of those films that just touches you after watching it. Not a typical gangster film. Pacino stamps his mark on this film in a role that can't help but be compared to his classic role as Michael Corleone, in both the first Godfather, and the final one. He plays Carlito Brigante, an old streetlord trying to go legitimate (sound familiar?). The basic storyline does no justice to this film though, for it is what lies beneath that really captures the imagination. The story develops into a complex, yet followable tale. The subplots intervene at perfect times. The overiding desire to become straight really is evident in Carlito's character. I still haven't caught my breath after this one. The end is unthinkable. It had the tell tale signs of being a very predictable finale, until the final twist.Pacino oozes street instinct right from the very first scene of trouble. This film was made for him, although his voice is rather annoying at the start of the film, until it becomes more familiar. If ever he came close to bettering Michael Corleone, it is this role.",Carlito's Way

With Charlie Brigante trying to go straight it almost mirrors Michael Corleone's attempt to make the 'family business' legitimate. The big difference is that in Carlito's Way we aren't seeing a vain attempt to cash in on the success of a popular film series, which really is all The Godfather III ever was.Al Pacino was on fine form in the title role, but is probably outshone by Sean Penn as the coke-addict lawyer, David Kleinfeld, who was almost certainly the inspiration for Ken Rosenberg in Grand Theft Auto: Vice City, which of course is directly connected by the involvement of Luis Guzman in both titles - as Pachanga in Carlito's Way and as the voice of Ricardo Diaz in GTA: Vice City.Also it's good to see Viggo Mortensen in a role so vastly different to those he played in Lord of the Rings, Hidalgo or even GI Jane. As an actor who usually plays such strong characters, it is a refreshing change (if you can regard it as such) to see him in a wheelchair with a colostomy bag.All round well acted, beautiful setting, and some laugh-out-loud moments to boot.

260,antonuccichristopher,Vastly underrated movie,10,13 October 2007,"What can you say about this movie? This is a masterpiece, and yet, very underrated. It is overshadowed by Scarface and this movie deserves to be in the rankings of Scarface and one of Al Pacino's best roles. Also, with a surprisingly good role from Sean Penn made this movie even better. We also see a young Luis Guzman.When I first saw this, I didn't know what to expect. I knew it was directed by the same director of Scarface and the front cover almost looks the same as Scarface. So, I rented it and was amazed at how good it was. I had a feeling it would be good and amazed that it was really good. In my opinion, I think it is better than Scarface.So if you like Al Pacino, violence, and liked Scarface, I recommend Carlito's Way to you.

That's Carlos Brigante. Pacino does his usual top flight job. Some of the romantic plot line is overdone. I also agree with others that Penn was stellar. This is one of his best roles for sure. This or Sgt Tony Meserve in Casualties of War would be at the top of my list. In both, Penn flawlessly portrays a man who completely loses his moral compass in the midst of his descent into a chaotic underworld. DePalma always does a terrific job with the period details too.Good gangster flick. Not in the pantheon, but that's rarified air.",Carlito's Way

Rivaled only, in its genre, by the likes of Goodfellas and The Godfather.Carlito's Way runs counter to the orthodox in terms of classic 'gangster' movies. The focus is not on rising from the gutters and gaining reputation and status, as we may expect, but rather on redemption. Pacino plays Carlito Berganzi, a Puerto-Rican ex-con who is trying to avoid the seduction of the streets whilst raising enough money to get away from New York. De Palma's classic shows a love story with Carlito reuniting with his true love (Penelope Ann Miller) after 5 years, and subsequently aiming to redeem himself in her eyes. The lure of the streets is evident throughout, as well as Carlito 's pride and loyalties to his coke-addicted lawyer (Sean Penn). The movie contains frequent edge-of-the-seat action scenes and phenomenal pieces of acting throughout. It allows us to empathise with Carlito and believe that he is genuine in his reformed spirit. The casting is perfect and allows for a movie reminiscent of Scarface, with an added romance not dissimilar to Casablanca. A must see for anyone.",Carlito's Way

Through superb acting Al Pacino builds the character of Carlito Brigante in a way that the audience simply cannot help but become involved in his plight. Carlito is an ageing, former hood in New York, just released from prison with help from his illigitimate lawyer friend, Dave Kleinfeld. He is torn between his shady past and his longing to lead a normal life with his true love, Gail. Brigante takes us on a dangerously exhilerating ride as he juggles his past and present; loyalty and distrust; friends and enemies; and life and death. Sean Penn is excellent as Kleinfeld, De Palma's cinematography is superb and Pacino is as always, breathtakingly good. Anyone who watches this film should be touched by story and moved by Pacino's performance. It develops emotions in a similar way to films like American History X, Donnie Brasco, and The Hurricane.

We hear Carlito: ""Where are all the mini-skirts..."". The man is entranced by a girl's behind and drops the match. Only a few seconds later does he shake his hand as if he got burned. This is one of many details (not listed on IMDb) that poison this movie. Other aspects will strain your belief:How can a 300-pound man survive in East River hanging to a buoy? When exactly did Pacino's character take out the bullets from the gun in Kleinfeld's room? Why does Carlito tell the mafia he ""hasn't seen"" his lawyer when that's a dead giveaway for his implication in the killing of a mob boss? A pro like Carlito simply wouldn't make that mistake.Of course Carlito's Way is not without its brilliance. The party at Kleinfeld's summer house where everyone is snorting coke, the early pool bar shootout, etc. Great performances by Leguizamo and Mortensen. Sean Penn is simply brilliant as Kleinfeld, the corrupt lawyer, and his portrayal no-doubt inspired the Rosenberg character in the Vice City and San Andreas games. De Palma, however, falls in a common trap in Carlito's Way, he's afraid to take chances. Watching the ""making of"" documentary included on the DVD was almost painful. Carlito's Way clearly had many great ideas that were later dropped. One example is how the dialog was extremely vulgar gangster slang but reportedly was later changed to regular English because it made the Latino community angry. The pool bar scene is extremely well shot, but David Koepp, the screenwriter, admits that it's only a device to fool the audience for the next hour and put up with the rest of the movie which is mostly talk. Ouch. (note: If you want a movie where Pacino delivers lines flawlessly, watch Glengarry Glenn Ross)Then there is Jorge Porcel in the role of Saso, the club-owner. Porcel seems deaf and wooden when Pacino interacts with him. I thought it was an error in editing the first time I watched it. Again watching the ""making of"" explains it. De Palma cast a non English-speaking actor who has no idea what Pacino is telling him or when to deliver replies. As the audience you might be asking yourself ""why'd they do that?"" Carlito's Way was a bomb waiting to explode, you see, for its portrayal of Puerto Ricans or Latinos on a broader scale, as criminals. Solution: cast Jorge, a well-liked Argentinian TV personality, in a supporting role and hope to appease the masses. Some directors who become veterans decide that after a while it's just not viable to take chances anymore. Politics is what hurt Carlito's Way the most. This movie could have been number two in a trilogy of De Palma/Pacino gangster movies but in fact buries any chance of another gem like Scarface from being released.",Carlito's Way

It shows how even a hardened criminal has a human quality and is capable of loving his girlfriend and remaining loyal to the ""code of the streets"". I am actually not a huge fan of Sean Penn and he was even hesitant to do this film. With that said, I thought it was a perfect casting. He played the 'nervous jew lawyer' brilliantly.

Combined with great performances from Sean Penn and Penelope Ann Miller, this film is a roller-coaster ride of ""will he, won't he"" tension and heavy , though not gratuitous, violence.So swept away do we get in Carlito's struggle that we actually forget that he's dying at the beginning of the film, and are praying that he'll make it by the end.

All other movies are judged with Carlito as being 10/10, 5/10 OK, 1/10 so bad I couldn't finish watching it.  I would love to see another 10 film, but have yet to do so. The characters are excellent.  Carlito is flawless, Gail is exceptional. Clienfeld is just the perfect lawyer-scumbag.  Norwalk was obviously created by someone who has dealt with cops before.  Even his cousin is just so real. Benny Blanco is like the typical gansta wana be. Great movie.",Carlito's Way
278,jpy,"As good as it gets, a must for any fan of Scarface (1983).",9,8 February 2001,"Carlito's Way (1993), is a brilliant cinematic work. Pacino's performance as Carlito Berganzi displays the duplicity and subsequent torment between his reformed spirit, and the endless seduction of the street, embodied more specifically as his reputation,legacy,those who know him, of him, and those whom he allows in his innermost circle. Sean Penn is phenomenal as the lawyer representing Carlito, his metamorphosis into character is testament to his depth of talent. Penelope Ann Miller, as the long-suffering love of Carlito's life is dramatically and visually enchanting. The casting is perfect. The supporting cast superb, perfectly augmenting the film. The script is alive with literary devices, the story line(s), characters, dialogue, themes, sub-texts,etc., make this an almost endlessly watchable film. Of this genre, Its all there, action, suspense, violence, confrontations, chases,  prerequisite street and wise guy character profiling with the right dialogue to make it work. Directed, executed and rendered a cinema great. Carlito's Way is atypical of the gangster genre, although it adheres to certain basics. It is also  a love story, not boy meets girl, ad nauseum, but real, destined soul mates, wrenched apart and thrown back together five years later by some abberation of fate. As one experiences spiritual,moral disintegration, the other the anti-thesis. Carlito's Way is a mix of genre's veiled with diligent artistic discretion. I even see certain thematic similarities to Casablanca. Watching Carlito's Way I had the feeling that De Palma wanted to resurrect and redeem poor old Tony Montana, Scarface (1983). Perhaps it was self-redemption, or a means to a great film with a second view or maybe the fun of bringing back that great ensemble of talent, based on a similar theme. A sequel of sorts, not to diminish either film in anyway. Released exactly ten years after Scarface, the comparisons are more than obvious. Ten years later, De Palma and Pacino. Oliver Stone missing, but another great script. In Carlito's Way, Pacino again plays a Hispanic drug lord. Now Puerto Rican in New York City, before Cuban in Miami. Now drug lord repentant, whereas in Scarface, drug lord vehemently unrepentant and devoid of remorse, from beginning to surrealistic end. Instead of classic gangster genre prerequisites employed in Scarface, such as, coming from the bottom, rising in status, trust and favour in the eyes of the mob boss, eventually killing him, and gaining his empire his woman(Michelle Pfeiffer). Love? Its not in the equation- Carlito only wants to unite with his TRUE LOVE. To redeem himself in her eyes, after causing her the heartbreak of losing him forever.(Which it would have been, if not for the quirk of intervention by Carlito's coke addicted, sociopathic lawyer). Carlito seeks solely to prove to his love that he is truly changed, honest, sincere, and even has a plan whereupon they can live happily ever after. Carlito and his girl are likeable. Upon viewing this film one is compelled to empathy, wanting them to escape insurmountable odds (the almost onmniprescent serpent-like ""street""), finding and deserving of happiness as long as they may live. However, it is though The Angel of Death has been hidden somewhere in every frame of De Palma's film, casting a shadow, waiting patiently to put his hand upon...Even the ancillary characters from Scarface are brought back in legions for Carlito's Way. Carlito's Way is Scarface with ""feelings"". Which is another similarity in the two films, ""feelings"" is the Achille's Heel of both Carlito Berganzi and Tony Montana. I also believe both films were vastly underrated and overlooked by the mainstream media, but upon populist vote, they are both widely esteemed as ""classic"". I'd give Carlito's Way (1993) nine out of ten. If I saw a ten, it would be a life changing event.",Carlito's Way

Carlito's way did this for me. It just completely blew me away. it is a fantastic movie, plain and simple. Sean Penn is brilliant as Pacino's crooked lawyer, his acting is convincing but looks so effortless. As this movie finished i sat still for a few minutes just going over the movie in my head, thinking about how good it is. If you get the chance to see it, you should, you will not be disappointed. If you have yet to be convinced of how good Pacino really is (unlikely if you have seen Scarface,The Godfather,Scent of a Woman) go see Carlito's Way. Work of a genius!",Carlito's Way
282,nejore75,Probably the best Brian de Palma film,10,20 November 2019,"After watching this film out of the blue on its satellite premiere back in the mid 1990s, this became one of the best I've seen. I've watched hundreds of films, and can really only think of half a dozen or so that I've found to be better than this. I could tell after the opening monologue/narration that this was going to be an emotionally charged ride.Yes, perhaps revealing part of the end at the beginning was an unusual choice, but the viewer still doesn't know the full circumstances of what happened or what the final outcome of that scene is. It is thanks to the intelligence of the script, acting, and direction that we are still distraught when this scene does come back around again at the end.From the first scene to the last, everything about it is expertly handled: the costumes, set design, the script. The film holds no punches with many suspenseful scenes and action. The quieter moments also allows Al Pacino and Penelope Ann Miller's interaction to give the film a softer edge, which comes to a distraught conclusion at the finale.Both Al Pacino (as Carlito Brigante) and Sean Penn (as David Kleinfeld) are on excellent form. David Koepp provided a solid script, full of memorable scenes and dialogue. And despite not being very knowledgeable of music from the '70s, I enjoyed the soundtrack very much. Accompanying the soundtrack on the film is Patrick Doyle's musical scores, which are exquisite, especially during the Grand Central station scenes and ending.Full of emotional moments, solid action scenes, and a jukebox soundtrack that add to the overall atmosphere. The more times you watch this film, the more the brilliance of it will become clear. There are many standout scenes, and while subsequent views of the escalator scene may seem overlong, it is all masterfully put together, combining great acting, direction, and topped off with a super music score. A brilliant sequence of set pieces.This is one of Brian de Palma's most solid films that builds up to an explosive finale. Watch it multiple times: once to follow the film and there after to marvel in the filmmaking techniques. It was good to see such a talented director back on top form again with such enthusiasm and using many of his patented camera techniques to give the film extra gravitas.",Carlito's Way
283,solarize,gangster movie with lots of suspense,9,9 August 2002,"The reason why I find this movie so great is because this isn't just a shooting gangster movie instead it is a movie where the suspense level is building till the end of the movie, keeping you on the edge of your seat. And great acting work of Al Pacino as retired gangster and Sean Penn as corrupt attorney. A Must See movie!",Carlito's Way

I don't now why is not a World recognized classic triller!!!...the history is perfect, the acting is perfect (God bless Pacino). Idefinitely recommend this outstanding movie. (Sorry my horrible English) Brian the Palma make a master piece. Sean Penn incredible acting, Penelope Ann Miller beautiful and convincing, Jhon Leguizamo has a surprising appearance. The history involving you from the beginning until the end. I guarantee that this movie is good!!! Very Good! Excellent! A collection piece.",Carlito's Way

Outside he decides not to return to crime, to gather some money and get out of New York ASAP.However things are not going as smooth as he hoped for. First, decision to be straight is received as a joke of the day. Then, after his gang dispersed, new guys shoot first and ask questions later. Finally his best friend has an agenda.Pacino is marvelous as an ""out-of-date"" ex-con, a Tony Montana that developed conscious, who's trying to achieve his goal, but is being constantly pushed back into murky waters of crime. Penn is just as impressive as a cracked-up lawyer that is not making Carlito's job any easier.

288,tobinatort,Award for 'Worst Movie Ending In History',10,12 August 2009,"I recently watched this movie for the first time. From the start I really enjoyed the film. There was plenty of action and a really good story line. The directing and acting was excellent all the way through the movie. Any movie with Al Pacino is going to be a good movie right? I was really into the movie throughout the lenght of the film, to the point where I did not want to take my eyes off the screen because I was afraid I would miss something. However, without telling what happens, don't you think that the event at the end of the movie was horrible? They built up all this suspense towards the ending and then just crushed it. Even though I really enjoyed the film, I was extremely disappointed with the ending. So as a warning to others who have not yet seen the film, be prepared for the 'Worst Movie Ending In History'. They should make an actual award for that, this movie would definitely win, even this many years later!",Carlito's Way
289,HiddenShadow_247,Al Pacino rocks in this film!,8,21 January 2010,"Right from the start this film looked promising and it sure was all the way through to the end. It is predictable that whatever Al Pacino stars in is going to be a masterpiece of some sort. Carlito's Way is another one of his masterpiece and what's even better is that Sean Penn costars and Brian De Palma directs this film as well. The beginning makes no sense at all but right from that moment as Al's character voice overs it just gives you a good masterpiece sort of feeling. Everyone should be grateful and privileged that they are seeing one of the best movies ever made. The dialog is fine and the story is interesting while some of the action scenes are smart and cool. Al Pacino is the best actor in this whole film because without him this film would be junk and should be avoided at all costs but thankfully Brian De Palma casted him. Sean Penn was good as well but his appearance looked hideous and made him look like a complete retarded lawyer. To put a long story short: Sean Penn could not give a better performance than Al Pacino. The real credit goes to the director, Brian De Palma. for creating this and without him all would be lost and watching this movie would be a waste of time. F*ck the Golden Globes for not giving Carlito's Way an award because this film is as good as Scarface and Good Fellas. The music is this film is pretty explosive and it really captures you at the end fight scene.Carlito, a Puerto-Rican drug boss, is out prison after serving five years all thanks to his lawyer friend David Klienfeld. He vows to stop his past from landing him in jail again but trouble starts following him and young druggies want to make a name for themselves. He becomes embroiled in something dangerous even for him and when things go bad he has to run away from some enemies. His old girlfriend gets back with him and together they have to make it out alive. A trail of deception always follows him. Cops and killers will be after him and he has to outwit them all and save himself.This film is not like how Scarface was, all blood and guts with no story, but this film is unique because it offers a great potential story with minimum amount of gore. You have to watch out for the fight sequences because they will blow you away and I mean really blow you away. This film does have flaws and one of them is the bad acting from Viggo Mortensen and he sucked bad because he didn't look like a gangster at all. Guess he was still a rookie back then. The other big flaw is Al Pacino's Puerto Rican accent which fails him completely to where he was born: America or Puerto Rico. Overall, this film doesn't disappoint but many people will be disappointed because this film tells the end before the beginning and they are right that it ruins the point of the film. Everyone should have a good time even though if it is a little bit slow or boring but wait until the end. Please! If you liked this film, I also recommend Good Fellas, Scarface, Casino, American Gangster, and Death Sentence.",Carlito's Way
290,jodie-mansell-898-557369,Beautiful stylish gangster film,8,15 November 2010,"Carlito's way is a master class for budding writers and directors of how to do an understated beautiful gangster film. For me the opening sequence sums it up; Carlito has just been shot and rather than high action and colossal amounts of blood we are given black and white, quiet and serenity. It feels like the camera never stops moving twisting and turning from Carlito's POV to the bystanders, this effect mimics the sick feeling of passing in and out of consciences incredibly well and at times is hard to watch. The nineteen-forte esquire Humphrey Bogart style voice over is the icing on the cake, it's not self-indulgent or corny, and it doesn't give away the rest of the film but wets the appetite for what is to come.",Carlito's Way

Wow...since then i never waste an occasion to watch it again every time i find this masterpiece in different TV channels. An absolute classic. A towering performance by Al Pacino. After this film he should be retired from acting to end a glorious carrier with The Masterpiece. Every great gangster movie has an obvious human drama. Carlito's Way has it.A beautiful love story, not finalized with an happy end, but this is what you expect from a brilliant script. It has great cinematography that pulls you into the story. De Palma took another risk by choosing Al Pacino, who was then going through a lean patch in his career, to play Carlito's part but what to say at the end...Wow...You did it Brian! Brian De Palma did an amazing job directing this movie. Powerful! So unbelievably powerful!",Carlito's Way
292,T-1000-101,How can anyone NOT like this movie.,9,24 April 2004,Every facet of this movie is Depalma triumph. Poor Carlito (Pacino) tries to do the right thing in a world that's changed more than he realises. His loyalty to his friends in an age where friendships are cheap and willingness to shed his murky past are admirable and the audience simply falls for this character. The events at the end have such a huge impact at the end of this movie as a result. The score is again brilliant even when compared to Untouchables and Scarface and the action has your heart pounding as it did in Jaws and Terminators 1 and 2.It's a shame that this movie is not as well known as it shouldfive stars,Carlito's Way
293,avibas619,Good Film,8,21 September 2014,"Hard to admit that it is SEAN PENN himself because I have seen Gangster Squad first and then this movie. And the way Sean's character turned from being innocent to a bad guy with no faithful or loyal feelings for others is, how to say, hard to do but shown that it is possible. And something to learn is the way Al Pacino's character reacts in stressful situations,notice his eyes never gives away anything even in tense situations. Also the heroine's act is very good. There have been some similarities with Scarface, but as the movie is based on a Porto Rican we can't really blame. (There are few recurring characters from Scarface movie) Watch it. You will not be bored. Instead you will enjoy it.",Carlito's Way

A gangster trying to get out of his dark world, but find no ways. Overall an interesting movie. Specially the most interesting part of the movie is the last 20 minutes. Suspense about the unknown ending. All performed the best. I think this movie is underrated. It is some how classic, may be that is the reason. Sean Penn's character was also very interesting, a lawyer who becomes a gangster. But Al Pacino says ""Not taught at school and No beginning at late."" John Leguizamo also performed well. Penelope Ann Miller was very beautiful. Overall Nice Movie.",Carlito's Way

Al Pacino is great as always in his role as Carlito Brigante. Carlito's Way is an extremely underrated Al Pacino movie and deserves to be appreciated as one of the greatest films there is and also i have seen and to mention one of Al Pacinos greatest.

299,ufo_sk8r,Masterpiece in every sense of the word.,10,13 November 2005,"Carlito's way is an excellent film, definitely a masterwork of both Al Pacino and director Brian De Palma. I just saw this film for the first time last month when a friend of mine recommended it to me, Coincidentally the Special Edition had been released and it was only $16.88 at Wal Mart so I figured what the heck? I watched it and WOW! This film is probably one of the most under rated movies I've ever had the knowledge of. I've watched it at least 5 times since October 28th and it hasn't gotten even the least bit old or too familiar. Easily superior to Pacino and De Palma's earlier rendezvous ""Scarface"" in terms of wit, cast, and overall performance. The character of Carlito is like a more humanly motivated version of Tony Montanna, and a good guy somewhat compared to the vicious Montanna. Pacino has also gotten more comfortable with his role of a Puerto Rican character since Scarface also, this time his accent's way more convincing and one of the film's high points. Sean Penn also gives the performance of a career playing Carlito's two faced, coke head lawyer.This movie is a masterpiece, one of the top ten films I believe everyone should see.",Carlito's Way
300,kennethsayers,One of Al Pacino's best and that's saying something!,10,6 January 2017,"Just a quick summary really. I'm a big film fan and this is one of my top 5. Great story, brilliantly cast and filmed, you feel you're walking alongside Pacino as he narrates you through the plot and dynamic locations, you can almost feel the buzz and underlying menace of his neighborhood! You find yourself desperately routing for Carlito to succeed despite his vicious past, which he justifies by claiming to have had few options, and this you easily accept as Pacino shows a softer side to his characters nature with such artistry. Notable performances from Sean Penn and a young John Leguizamo amongst others add to the quality of this movie and the feeling of real characters being portrayed. This of course does the book (After Hours) justice as the author, Edwin Torres, was writing about the barrio in which he grew up and characters that he himself encountered there, the film preserving that feeling of intimacy with its subject. If your're a Pacino or gangster film fan then you need to watch this film. If you're both then you've already seen it!",Carlito's Way
301,Ya_dad,Powerful... Gripping... Telling it as it is,10,15 November 2005,"Having seen this movie so long after having heard many people go on about it, I would summarise that it's fair to say it definitely lived up to it's expectations. Al Pacino excels in his portrayal of the gangster-go-clean fella who can't break free because of his old companions and old life holding on to him, slowly trying to drag him back into a life of crime, risk and danger. Having personally experienced life on the streets, this film tells it as it is... straight up, and shows just how in the end no matter what you do, how much you make... it all comes back on you. This is an excellent film with great acting performances, which powerfully displays a message into your mind and leaves you thinking at the end. A must see for all.",Carlito's Way

I may have had too high expectations, but the IMDB rating is unrealistically high, probably obtained from Al Pacino and Sean Penn fans. The film is quite average, already seen and not even close to gangster classics. The acting is good, Penn is great, but the story has a lot of flaws. Almost all dialogues and monologues are uninteresting, the connection between Al Pacino and Penelope Ann Miller, looks artificial and does not arouse emotions. Due to high expectations, I ended up quite disappointed with this film.",Carlito's Way

It has romance, violence, betrayal, gangsters, sex and sorrow. What makes this film excellent is that all the pieces of the puzzle come together beautifully, great intense acting from Pacino, excellent directing and an excellent screenplay. To me, this was another 'Scarface'(different level of gangster), with one exception, that being the intensity of the character. We see Carlito now has plans for his life and is a thought out person in contrast to the crazy, uncontrollable and unsustainable Tony Montana he portrayed in Scarface. It's suspense all the way, and Sean Penn serves as a finishing touch as his faithful 'save your own ass' kind of guy. At just over 2hrs in length, this film kept me wanting more. The ending, is of course tragic and well defined but yet makes you feel so sorry for Carlito, after coming so close to reaching his ultimate dream of paradise, he was found short by the one thing he respected, that was friendship. Any Pacino fan out there, this is a MUST for their collection, along with 'Scarface' and 'Scent of a woman'.",Carlito's Way
