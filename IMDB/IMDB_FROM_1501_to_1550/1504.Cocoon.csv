0,TheLittleSongbird,Youthful innocence and ageing wisdom,7,22 September 2018,"With a great idea, a director in Ron Howard who has done good films despite being disliked by many and a talented cast (Don Ameche, Maureen Stapleton, Jessica Tandy, Wilford Brimley), 'Cocoon' sounded to me like it would be good. Another interest point was its Oscar wins for Best Visual effects and Best Supporting Actor for Ameche (his only Oscar during his comeback period in a long career full of very good films and performances).'Cocoon' fortunately struck me as a good film, very intriguing that lifts the soul and charms with fun and emotional moments. It could have been even better and isn't perfect or one of the best films from that year, but there is an awful lot to like and even love here. Sadly it is rather overlooked today, a distinction that is not deserving, and deserving of much more credit than it gets. It may be overlong, with it faltering and running out of steam towards the end where it gets predictable, and the alien characters (excepting Brian Dennehy's, who fares very well here) are not quite as interesting or as developed as the older cast. Also found Tahnee Welch (while fetching) a bit bland in a plot-device role and Steve Guttenberg rather forgettable and somewhat annoying in his. To me, the older cast are far more memorable and compelling. All are very sassy and distinguished, with Ameche being an absolute joy (am not going to go into the debate of whether he deserved the Oscar or not, despite seeing many people citing his as one of the worst in the category and saying it was a career Oscar it wasn't an issue for me because it was a great performance in its own way). Stapleton, Tandy and Brimley bring sass and zest to their roles and Jack Gilford is a scene stealer. Visually, 'Cocoon' is very well made, the effects holding up well and thankfully not being overused or abused like is the case for some films. The photography boasts a lot of style and atmosphere, as well as an expansive and vibrant touch. James Horner provided a typically lush and not too sweeping or syrupy score that adds poignancy to the proceedings. The script has gently and laugh-out-loud funny moments, charm and heartfelt emotion and the story is uplifting and in particularly the first half imaginative with a suitably bittersweet message. Howard keeps things steady and in control and doesn't make the film wallow in sentimentality too much which was a wise move.Overall, an easy to like and watch film. 7/10 Bethany Cox",Cocoon
1,bkoganbing,New Spring in their step,10,10 February 2013,"The Citizen Kane of Ron Howard's directorial career has to be and still is Cocoon. It's a film that combines fantasy and science fiction better than any ever done before or since and it's the most life affirming item you'll ever see on the big screen or small. It also gives some of our older players some really fine roles and brought an Oscar late in his career to one of the class acts of Hollywood.The citizens of one of thousands of nursing homes are just whiling away the end hours of their lives and in Florida there's more of these homes than most places. Three of those citizens are Wilford Brimley, Hume Cronyn and Don Ameche. One of their activities is to go into an indoor swimming pool in a vacant house next door.But those activities are interrupted when four strangers, Brian Dennehy, Linda Harrison, Clint Howard, and Tyrone Power IV rent the place. It's that swimming pool that interests them. The quartet also rents Steve Guttenberg's boat and they bring up some large size boulder type rocks which they place in the pool.Our senior citizens keep going into the pool even with the rocks there and pretty soon they're noticing some marvelous changes, in Hume Cronyn, the most marvelous of all as his cancer goes into a complete remission, mystifying his doctors. That leads our group now joined by wives Jessica Tandy and Maureen Stapleton for Cronyn and Brimley and companion Gwen Verdon for Ameche that these are some special people.Special they are, humans they're not as the quartet shows them they're aliens in human body suits. And after some heartache and tragedy for both earth people and aliens, the aliens offer these old folks a chance never given to any humans before. For that you see Cocoon for.This is the kind of film that you can watch over and over and still feel good about yourselves and feel good that there are others out there in the vast universe who've played the game of life and have mastered the rules. There are so many other science fiction films that show monsters and other worldly creatures coming to earth with the most malicious of intentions. Cocoon is such a refreshing change.Cocoon got two Oscars in 1985 for special effects and a Best Supporting Actor Award for Don Ameche. In a sense it was wrong to single out Ameche because all the senior citizen players cut some fine characters that you'll remember and enjoy. But Ameche was always a class act in Hollywood, a person you'll not hear an unkind word about written or spoken by his contemporaries in a career that lasted from the Thirties to the Nineties. It was an award for a lifetime more than anything else.One of those characters also was Jack Gilford. There's a famous classic Twilight Zone episode which also takes place in a senior citizen home where the residents there are given the same chance as these people are. With a lot less attention I might add. Gilford fulfills the same function as Russell Collins did in The Twilight Zone, the one who stays behind because he can't bring himself to take the step necessary.Who knows how long or if humankind will approach what these aliens have, but in many ways Cocoon offers a peak into an existence more fabulous than ever portrayed on film before.",Cocoon
2,Leofwine_draca,Gloopy sentiment,5,1 August 2019,"COCOON is one of the big Hollywood sci-fi pictures of the 1980s, although it's also one of the most sentimental. I could stomach the similar *BATTERIES NOT INCLUDED thanks to the interesting plot and aliens, but this is an all-out feel-good movie that seems to have been particularly designed for elderly viewers to enjoy (Steve Guttenberg is, in particular, an unnecessary presence in the story). My main problem with it is that there isn't much in the way of a story. A group of old-timers have fun, swim in a pool and recapture their youth, but the whole second half is a rather dull journey with thriller elements that never take off. I found Brian Dennehy to be miscast as well. Certainly not a bad film, but it's not something I'd watch again.",Cocoon
3,SnoopyStyle,heart felt movie with legendary actors,8,17 April 2015,"It's the Sunny Shores Villas Retirement Community in St. Petersburg, Florida. Art Selwyn (Don Ameche), Ben Luckett (Wilford Brimley) and Joe Finley (Hume Cronyn) sneak into the mansion next door to swim in the pool. They are slowly losing against time. Jack Bonner (Steve Guttenberg) is a struggling boat owner. Walter (Brian Dennehy), Kitty (Tahnee Welch) and their group hire Bonner and his boat. Then they rent the mansion next to the retirement home. The old men sneak into the pool and discover that the new people have put in egg shaped boulders. They find themselves rejuvenated.Directed by Ron Howard, this is a real feel good movie. It doesn't hurt to have acting legends doing some 'heavy lifting'. There is a real heart in their story. Guttenberg is almost comic relief as he drools over Tahnee Welch. That's perfectly understandable. The plot is somewhat like 'Close Encounters of the Third Kind'. The older characters are not simplistic. They have fallibilities and nobilities. They make the movie great.",Cocoon
4,mark.waltz,The mix of laughter and tears gets me every time.,8,28 October 2021,"Get to know your extra terrestrial, especially when they have hearts as big as the ones played by Brian Dennehy, Tahnee Welch and their two fellow aliens, on earth to remove the more than dozen cocoons which they left behind thousands of years before. When Dennehy sheds a single tear over the ailing aliens dying after the life force is sucked out of them, you see something different than the monstrous ones from science fiction past. Only Robert Wise with ""The Day the Earth Stood Still"" and Spielberg with ""Close Encounters"" and ""E. T."" saw the potential of having aliens with souls bigger than anything humans could imagine, and here, it's Ron Howard who has continuously showed us his soul through similarly touching films of this nature.You've got one of the greatest ensembles here with veteran actors Don Ameche, Hume Cronyn, Wilford Brimley, Jack Gilford, Gwen Verdon, Jessica Tandy, Maureen Stapleton and Herta Ware as senior citizens living their last gasp at life as they try to find a fountain of youth, and for one of them, it will be too late. Ameche gets to break dance, Brimley bonds with a beloved grandson and Cronyn gets his groove back a bit too much while grouchy Gilford denies his ailing wife the chance to swim in the pool of life.The wives don't get the screen time of their husbands (although Ameche and Verdon are not married), but they each get tender moments that shows the kindness in their souls. Tandy and Cronyn get the strongest material dramatically while Ameche and Verdon seem to be having the most fun. Stapleton, her big heart shining through her infrequent moments, is very touching. Gilford and Ware are the most heartbreaking with the usually comical Gilford cast against type and giving a beautiful if bitter performance, yet very real.Then there's Steve Guttenberg as the struggling boat owner who aides Dennehy and finds love with Welch, funny and incredulous as he learns the truth, and getting a classic line when he discovers how these particular visitors from another planet make love. So there are lots of laughs and a few tears and amazement as you see all the great special effects that come in the way of this Sensational story, maybe truly out-of-this-world but one that will grab your heart and never let go.",Cocoon
5,classicsoncall,"""You know, I can't remember the last time I really took a risk"".",7,7 June 2009,"I generally get a kick out of stories wherein old timers (and for perspective, I'm almost there myself, already am by some reckoning), find renewed enthusiasm and vigor from a mythical fountain of youth. This one however only took me half way to the finish line. Maybe it had to do with the involvement of space aliens and giant pods, but more so I think with the virtually one sided opinion expressed by most of the central characters that giving up everything they have to live forever was the 'right thing to do' (sorry, that's just the way it came out, I wasn't thinking of Wilford Brimley's commercials).The set-up with Brimley's character you see, seemed to be pointing entirely in the other direction. The relationship with his grandson begged for a thorough soul searching moment in which Ben (Brimley) would decide in favor of staying put to share in the the joys of watching his fishing partner grow up and become a man. Sure, there was that one moment of doubt that was discussed with wife Mary (Maureen Stapleton), but it was dismissed rather quickly. Ultimately, I came away feeling that Ben's decision was somewhat selfish. Additionally, the way the picture ended, with the young boy gazing happily heavenward, didn't ring true for me. After all, he would grow old and die someday, while his grandparents were tooling around the universe in immortality.Without the whole alien pod subtext, I think the picture would have shown greater promise. There's nothing wrong with experiencing the sublime and magical, and if it makes you feel young again, so much the better. There may be 'better' things to do than running around the backyard with my own grandson as he tries to squirt me with his water gun, and falling down when he 'gets me'. But I don't think I'd want to give that up for a shot at living forever if I had to miss the experience.I'm reminded of a 1962 Rod Serling 'Twilight Zone' episode titled 'Kick the Can' that also took place in a nursing home. In that one, a senior citizen believes he's found the secret of youth in playing children's games. As in ""Cocoon"", there's another resident like Bernie (Jack Gilford) who remains a hold out, in favor of acting his own age. The story ends when the old man realizes he missed his opportunity to be a kid again, as he watches his friends skip off into the darkness to revive their youth. That mere twenty five minute story holds a lot more poignancy for me than ""Cocoon"", and as support, I've remembered it for forty years since I first saw it.",Cocoon
6,lee_eisenberg,When was the last time that Steve Guttenberg starred in a movie like this?,7,13 March 2006,"Ron Howard's movie ""Cocoon"" portrays several senior citizens who, after swimming in a nearby pool, begin to feel young again. The movie is bittersweet, as some of the characters die during the film, but uplifting overall; not a masterpiece, but quite well done. The final shot is really impressive.Not that this is really a part of the movie in general, but one mildly befuddling thing here is the presence of Steve Guttenberg. It's weird to think of him in a such a well regarded movie. Oh well. C'est la vie. The point is that Ron Howard made quite a movie here. It's likely to make you wonder what will become of you as you age.",Cocoon
7,jboothmillard,Cocoon,8,9 January 2008,"I must admit I tried watching it once and got bored or tired, but seeing it again I'm glad I gave it another chance, it is a pretty good science-fiction fantasy. Basically Arthur 'Art' Selwyn (Oscar winning Don Ameche, who I knew did the voice of Shadow, the golden retriever in Homeward Bound: The Incredible Journey), Benjamin 'Ben' Luckett (Wilford Brimley) and Joseph 'Joe' Finley (Hume Cronyn) are three ordinary old men living in the home, and they are annoyed that their swimming pool isn't heated. Meanwhile, Jack Bonner (Steve Guttenberg) has his boat hired by three ordinary looking people, Walter (Brian Dennehy), Kitty (Tahnee Welch, daughter of Raquel) and Doc (Mike Nomad) for three weeks, so that they collect some special underwater things, what look like rocks. These rocks, or rather cocoons, are put into their house swimming pool, and not long later Art, Ben and Joe are trespassing while they are gone to use the pool. After using the pool, they are discovering they can do more physical things they could not before, in other words, they are feeling young again. By accident, Jack discovers that his three passengers are aliens wearing skin suits, they call themselves Antereans, and they are on Earth collecting cocoons containing their friends, Jack agrees to help them, and knows they mean no harm. As the three old men embrace their new found youthfulness, they also discover the secret of the Antereans, and also the other old people in the home, especially Bernard 'Bernie' Lefkowitz (Jack Gilford) and Alma Finley (Jessica Tandy) wonder about (or do not want to be part of) this ""fountain of youth"", and when all the old people (except Bernie) jump into the water to soak in youth, this is what kills the aliens inside the cocoons. So in the end, since they have absorbed the youthfulness of the alien cocoons, all the old people have a tough decision to make, stay on the Earth, or come with the Antereans to their home world to live forever, so all except Bernie decide to go with them. Also starring Maureen Stapleton as Marilyn Luckett, Gwen Verdon as Bess McCarthy, Herta Ware as Rosie Lefkowitz, The NeverEnding Story's Barret Oliver as David, Linda Harrison as Susan, Tyrone Power Jr. as Pillsbury, Clint Howard (Ron's brother) as John Dexter, Charles Lampkin as Pops and Jorge Gil as Lou Pine. I don't think Guttenberg is as bad as the critics think he is, the special effects are impressive, and I can see reasons why Ameche won the Oscar, a good film. It won the Oscar for Best Visual Effects, and it was nominated the Golden Globe for Best Motion Picture - Comedy/Musical. Very good!",Cocoon
8,rmax304823,"If You Fill It, They Will Swim.",6,5 March 2007,"If you like ""Field of Dreams"" you ought to get a kick out of this Twilight-Zone fantasy too. They both follow a similar trajectory. Similar, in fact, to Twilight Zone's ""Kick the Can"" episode, in fact, from which both may be derived. The director, Ron Howard, hasn't taken any chances here in this sentimental, mildly amusing, mildly thought-provoking story, but then he rarely does.This expedition from Antares (looking quite normal on the outside) comes to Earth to retrieve some cocoons left behind earlier when their planet was about to be turned into a monstrous prune -- something like that, anyway. It doesn't matter.They retrieve the cocoons from the ocean floor and stash them temporarily in the swimming pool of a deserted Florida mansion. The pool is being secretly and illegally used for wading by a three old dudes from a neighboring retirement community, Wilfred Brimley, Hume Cronyn, and Don Ameche. Without anyone's seeming to realize it, the cocoons are infusing the water with some elan vital that is exponentially more powerful than Geritol and Viagra combined. The boys don't begin to actually look different but they regain, let's say, both their youthful vigor and the turgor associated with it.Instead of sedate dances at the club to old-time Glenn-Millerish swing music, they go to discos and Ameche does a break dance, wowing the audience. Soon their wives begin enjoying a dip or two as well, and the couples wind up climbing trees and chasing each other through the mangroves.There's a younger couple too, a girl from Antares (Tahnee Welsh) and the owner of the boat that the aliens have hired (Steve Guttenberg). They fall for each other. The problem is that underneath these plastic exteriors, the Antarens, Tahnee Welsh included, are diminutive bilaterally symmetrical beings with tiny mouths and big eyes and they glow with the blinding, eyeball-coagulating light of an arc lamp. This presents certain problems, as you can imagine, when the young man inquires of Welsh, ""How do Antarens, um, express affection for one another."" ""Not in the way you think,"" she replies, and we can feel the guy's heart sink, ""but we show ourselves."" Well, that doesn't sound too bad, especially when Welsh begins showing herself by ridding her plastic body of its hampering outer garments. But then, alas, it gets kind of twisted because the rest of what she ""shows"" him resembles one of those huge spinning wheels made of fireworks that one sees at the climax of a Fourth of July picnic. Call me old fashioned but I think it helps to be less than ten years old to appreciate that particular mode of affectionate self display.Tahnee Welsh can't act, unfortunately, but looks good just walking around. The three old dudes -- and their wives, and Brian Dennehy -- do quite well. Don Ameche practically renewed his career with this film. And Jessica Tandy STILL looks fine. One of the Antarens has a wordless part and is a ringer for Tyrone Power, probably because he is Tyrone Power, Jr.The cocoons are being drained of their mojo because of all the humans sucking up to them. The leader of the Antarens generously offers to take a few humans along with him back to his planet. Some go along. Some insist on ""playing out the hand they've been dealt, not shuffling the deck again."" (It's kind of like Burt Lancaster's character in ""Field of Dreams,"" stuck in the present.) I don't know that I particularly blame the risk-averse old folks who decide to hang back and not live forever. Who would want to be a bus boy or an assistant professor for one thousand years? Anyway, it was a successful movie. It must have been because there was a sequel, meaning that the committee of MBA's sitting up there on Antares decided to greenlight another installment because there was probably another nickel left to be squeezed out of this Fountain of Youth fantasy.",Cocoon
9,BA_Harrison,The old-timers steal the show.,7,10 February 2019,"Hard to believe it, but there was a time when Steve Guttenberg was a major box-office draw, and Cocoon was one of the films that made it so. Directed by Ron Howard, this touching (some might say 'schmaltzy') sci-fi is strictly Spielbergian in tone: two hours of family-friendly fantasy with a warmth and charm that it's hard not to appreciate. The plot might leave a few unanswered questions, but the action is expertly handled by Howard, the film offering moments of joy, wonderment and tear-jerking pathos.Guttenberg plays Floridian tour boat owner Jack Bonner, who discovers that the group of people who have hired his craft are actually extraterrestrials who have returned to earth after thousands of years to rescue their friends, who were left behind when Atlantis sank beneath the waves. Sealed in cocoons, the stranded aliens are retrieved from the sea bed and placed in a swimming pool to replenish their lifeforce, the very same pool that is frequented by three trespassing OAPs from a nearby home. When the trio - Art Selwyn (Don Ameche), Ben Luckett (Wilford Brimley) and Joe Finley (Hume Cronyn) - take a dip amongst the cocoons, they find themselves given a new lease of life.With so much experience between them, it's no surprise that the old-timers steal the show, leaving Guttenberg and his otherworldly pals to play second fiddle. Gutternberg is adequate in his role, Tahnee Welch plays the spindly-limbed love interest from another galaxy, and Brian Dennehy is dependable as the leader of the aliens, but none of them can hold a candle to the breakdancing Ameche and his elderly pals, with a special mention for Jack Gilford as reluctant pensioner Bernie Lefkowitz, who seriously tugs at the heart strings when he tries too late to save the life of his wife Rose (Herta Ware).The film does leave one wondering why the aliens took so long to return for their friends, why they are so happy to pop them back in the sea and take a load of meddlesome coffin-dodgers into outer space instead, and whether Jack is ultimately thrown into jail for manslaughter, but, hey, best not to dwell on these things... just sit back and enjoy the antics of the old people while trying to forget that Guttenberg's success in this film led to more Police Academy films and 3 Men and a Baby.",Cocoon
10,moonspinner55,Older folks (not) acting their age...,6,13 August 2006,"Retirement home residents are energized by alien pods being stored in a swimming pool. I'm not quite sure what the appeal is, but the sight-gag of an older person acting like a youth of today always brings the house down. ""Cocoon"" is a series of these sight-gags underscored with an kindly-alien theme, resulting in one sticky package. Successful with audiences and the Academy (with Don Ameche winning a Supporting Oscar), the film spawned several imitations such as ""*batteries not included"" and kept Ameche himself on a roll for awhile, playing wily old codgers. Ron Howard's direction here is sentimental but lively, and the older actors are glorious to see on-screen, but Steve Guttenberg and his broken down vessel are a chore (as is the old stand-by of having the boat's engine give out just when it counts the most). ""Cocoon"" rests heavily--frustratingly--on so many old, worn-out clichés that it turns into a witless pie a la mode; yet, it does build up a feeling of good will with its cast, so much so that many viewers don't mind wading through the obviousness of the entire conception just to get to the prolonged happy ending. **1/2 from ****",Cocoon
11,blanche-2,Sweet film that probably means more today,8,7 January 2008,"1985's Cocoon, directed by Ron Howard, asks - would you give up the emotional, mental and physical pain of growing old if you could? Baby boomers today feel that death is optional and seek out whatever it takes to make them feel and look young - so if Cocoon came out in 2008, it would perhaps resonate even more.The story takes place in a rest home inhabited by a group of friends: Arthur (Don Ameche), Benjamin (Wilford Brimley) and his wife Marilyn (Maureen Stapleton), Joseph (Hume Cronyn) and his wife Alma (Jessica Tandy) and a perky red-head Bess (Gwen Verdon). The guys have taken to going to an abandoned pool house and swimming - without permission, of course. Then the building is rented by a man (Brian Dennehy). This same man also rents a boat from Jack Bonner (Steve Guttenberg), who is down on his luck and can use the money. He watches Jack, his beautiful assistant Kitty (Tahnee Welch) and some other people skindiving and bringing up huge silver packages. These packages are then dumped into the pool. After the men swim there one day, they find themselves suddenly rejuvenated and start having sex, staying up, nightclubbing and having more energy. Meantime, on the boat, Jack has gotten a look at Kitty getting ready for bed...and notices that she removes her skin as well as her clothes and glows in the dark.This movie has many poignant moments - Alma coming to grips with the fact that her husband has always cheated, and the saddest of all, when Bernard (Jack Gilford) who has been violently opposed to the whole idea of the pool as a fountain of youth, desperately brings his wife there.Howard cast this with an eye toward man's normal immortality - children - with Raquel Welch's daughter and Tyrone Power's son, Tyrone Power Jr. as Pillsbury - while telling the story of people who have a chance at a different kind of immortality. Both Power and Welch bear strong resemblance to their famous parents. The old-timers in the cast are among the greatest actors of their generation and sadly, we've lost nearly all of them now. Only Wilford Brimley remains. The film revived Don Ameche's career, and the cast returned for a sequel, ""Cocoon: The Return."" A wonderful film to see the old stars in a very touching story and to ask yourself - if you had the chance, would you take it?",Cocoon
12,Quinoa1984,"Often sweet, endearing sci-fi film",8,24 December 2000,Ron Howard's Cocoon is one of his best works as he brings a story full goodness in a dramedy with good actors and fine visual effects.  The story- a group of seniors discover a fountain of youth (distributed by the cocoons) in they're swimming pool and it changes all of their lives.  Fine cast assists a lot in this fantasy that has some good original quality on it's side.  Oscar winner for Don Ameche (best supporting actor) for his role as a old guy and another for the visual effects.  A,Cocoon
13,edwagreen,Cocoon-Far From A Boon *1/2,4,13 July 2009,"This is a classic stinker with a big named cast, mostly seniors who were well past their prime and bedtime in this one.This is quite a depressing film when you think about it. Remain on earth, and you will face illness and eventually your demise.Gwen Verndon showed that she could still dance. Too bad the movie didn't concentrate more on that. Maureen Stapleton, looking haggard, still displayed those steps from ""Queen of the Star Dust Ballroom,"" so much more down to earth from 10 years earlier.I only hope that this film doesn't encourage seniors to commit mass suicide on the level of Jim Jones. How can anyone be idiotic enough to like this and say it gets you to think?Why did Don Ameche win an Oscar for this nonsense?If the seniors were doing such a wonderful thing at the end, why was the youngster encouraged to get off the boat? Why did Steve Guttenberg jump ship as well? After all, he had found his lady-love. This would have been a nice film if the seniors had just managed to find their fountain of youth on earth and stay there.Sadly, with the exception of Wilford Brimley, at this writing, Vernon, Gilford, Stapleton, Ameche, Tandy, Cronyn and lord knows who else are all gone. The writers should have taken the screenplay and placed it with this group as well.",Cocoon
14,hitchcockthelegend,Sweet and interesting without achieving its main goals perhaps ?.,7,4 March 2008,"It's a tough one to call because it's such a heart warming film, it doesn't fail to have the viewer firmly onside with the older generation and their dovetailing lives. Yet to me it feels confused with it's core heart, was I meant to feel sorry for the older generation?, was I supposed to feel that the young are foolish for being afraid of old age ?, or is it merely a fable to urge us all to embrace old age?. I can't help thinking that director Ron Howard wanted to make a statement of sorts here, yet it gets lost in its sugar coated sentimentality.That said, the film is still a winner to me, it's great to see a cast of old timers showing the way, Don Ameche {best supporting actor winner}, Hugh Cronyn, and Wilfred Brimley light up the film with great vigorous performances. The plot of the film sees a group of aliens {led by Mr Reliable Brian Dennehy} come back to earth to pick up some cocoons they had stored for the millennia at the bottom of the ocean. They use a swimming pool in an empty house next to an old peoples home to further store the cocoons. Three of the residents from the home like to sneak into the empty house to take a swim in the pool, even tho they are bemused by the cocoons in there they swim away and start to feel really invigorated, their lives are about to change.This sets us up for an array of funny scenes as the old boys find that sporting prowess is back, their once dead sex drive has returned {much to the delight of their respective partners}, and yes they can break dance with the best of them !. Obviously all doesn't stay perfect for very long as the film brings in a downturn of events, this wonderful thing can so easily go wrong if abused and not kept secret, and then ultimately the old people blessed by this alien gift are asked to make a life changing choice, the finale plays out nicely with a chase sequence that ups the adrenalin quota, and sure enough it's coated nicely in syrup to bring about a thought provoking ending, 7/10.",Cocoon

Then they store them in the bottom of a swimming pool next door to a retirement home. A group of oldsters from the retirement home take a swim in the pool and find themselves feeling youthful and reinvigorated.Charming, pleasant, and touching film from Ron Howard that's a showcase for a fine cast of elderly actors. Don Ameche, Hume Cronyn, Jessica Tandy, Maureen Stapleton, and the other oldsters are all great but Wilford Brimley is the standout. It could be argued Steve Guttenberg is only in the movie to give it some youth appeal, to say nothing of his 'sort of romance' with Tahnee Welch (daughter of Raquel). But he doesn't detract from things at all and is likable throughout the picture. It's a truly unique and wonderful movie.

16,grantss,Lightly entertaining,6,7 February 2015,"A lightly entertaining comedy-drama from Ron Howard. Interesting plot that isn't very watertight. Feels very loose and slapped-together. Whole movie, in fact, lacks the gravitas necessary to make it a classic. Starts to feel like a chase-caper toward the end.Performances are so-so. Wilfred Brimley does a solid job and Don Ameche got a Best Supporting Actor Oscar and most of the performances are fine, just some seem very unconvincing. Tawnee Welch is particularly bad, and Steve Guttenberg should really stick to B-grade comedies.So, quite disappointing for such a well-known movie. However, not all bad. It keeps up a decent pace, is never dull, concept is reasonably original (if not sound) and does pose some interesting questions about life. Watchable.",Cocoon
17,view_and_review,The Swimming Pool of Youth,7,14 September 2019,"What would you do if you could turn back the clock on your body? Not a total rollback of the odometer because you'd still look and be old but what if physically you were as healthy as a 20-year-old yet 70+?I think that situation is a tad screwed up. If I feel like a 20-year-old I would like to look like a 20-year-old as well but feeling 20 again is still good.That was the situation for Ben (Wilford Brimley), Art (Don Ameche), and Joe (Hume Cronyn). These three elderly Floridians liked to sneak a swim in a pool on unoccupied property. I don't know who was caring for that pool but never mind that. After swimming in the pool with some giant rock-like objects in it they came out feeling like a million bucks but still looking like they had a date with the grim reaper in a few days. They'd found the fountain of youth... in a sense.This was a fun and novel movie. The fountain of youth is a thing of legend that many dream about but not many movies have addressed.

It's just delightful.Wilford Brimley, Don Ameche, Jack Gilford, Hume Cronyn, Jessica Tandy, Maureen Stapleton, and Gwen Verdon are the luckiest seniors in America. They were cast in this movie, when I'm sure dozens of old timers would have clambered at the chance! All kidding aside, their characters are very lucky. They live in a retirement home in Florida, and their sedentary, lackluster sunset years are about to get rejuvenated. Don, Wilford, and Hume make a habit of sneaking into the big house's pool next door, and one day, there are large, mysterious boulders at the bottom of the water. After that swim, they feel as young as teenagers - and they put big smiles on their wives faces that night. It's very funny, and it's especially charming to see Hume and Jessica climb into bed together since they were a happily married couple in real life.But where did the big rocks come from? Steve Guttenberg, a lowly yacht captain, gets hired by a group of tourists (Brian Dennehy, Tahnee Welch, and Tyrone Power, Jr.) to sail out in the middle of the ocean. They dive down in wet suits and procure the boulders from the ocean floor, then transfer them into the large house they're renting. Of course, if you know the story, you know I'm leaving something out. But just in case you have no idea what Cocoon is about, I'm letting it be a surprise.Most of Cocoon is heartwarming, funny, and sweet - but there is a touch of sadness in it (as you can tell from James Horner's heart tugging theme). Everyone has his own big moment and scene to show off his acting chops. Wilford has a great relationship with his grandson, Barret Oliver, Hume is battling a terminal illness, and Jack's wife has Alzheimer's disease. Don is all laughs, though. He's the resident bachelor of the group, and he grins, giggles, and moonwalks his way into an Academy Award. It's quite ironic that he won the Oscar, since he's the only one without any drama. But, voters love to laugh - and he's very funny.The cast has a great camaraderie together, and you can tell everyone had a blast making the film. This might not be relevant, but I think it's awfully cute that Ron Howard directed the flick (so be on the lookout for his brother Clint). As a former child star, he probably had a different appreciation of old timers than the average Hollywood director. It's really not possible to dislike this movie, so rent it this weekend and remember your grandparents.",Cocoon
20,Aaron1375,"A nice little comedy, science fiction drama.",7,6 September 2009,"Yes, how many movies even fit the bill as a comedy, science fiction, drama movie? Probably this, the sequel to this and that movie that also has Jessica Tandy in it ""Batteries not Included"". This movie is nothing all that great, but is still a nice little movie to watch. Seniors find a pool to go swimming in, the waters though seem to have a very positive effect on them as they feel young again. The catch here is that the pool is being used by aliens to help rejuvenate fellow aliens left on the planet so long ago. There are twists and turns here and there and many nice performances by some older actors and actresses of their time and you get Steve Guttenberg before he became a very overused actor in bad comedy movies. It is nice seeing the older people feeling young again, and it is also a bit irritating to see them go berserk at the end and causing so much destruction. The story takes a interesting shift near the end and the aliens and the elderly work together to do some good and the aliens make them a nice little offer. I though the movie ended rather well and did not call for a sequel, but one would unfortunately be made three years later. I prefer to see this one as stand alone and dismiss it for what it is, a cheap attempt to catch a little magic again.",Cocoon
21,Wuchakk,"Discovering the ""fountain of youth""",8,31 March 2013,"On the surface ""Cocoon"" (1985) is about elderly folks at a retirement home in Florida unknowingly finding the ""fountain of youth"" via a pool on an adjacent property. A peculiar group of people rent the property to store boulder-like objects they take from the bottom of the ocean. As such, the pool acquires healing powers and restore's the old folk's youthful vigor.Steve Guttenberg stars as the likable protagonist, the boat owner/operator who helps the people get to the objects in the ocean, but he has no idea what's really going on. The stunning Tahnee Welch, Raquel's daughter, plays one of the members of the peculiar group to whom Guttenberg's character takes a liking. Unlike Raquel, who's known for being a bit biyatchy, Tahnee shines with a winsome disposition. Brian Dennehy is also on hand as the leader of the odd group, and he does very well.Most great movies have a deeper subtext, and so it is with ""Cocoon."" The story is a commentary on aging, death, grieving and the yearning for eternal life. The people of the peculiar group are types of angels or, better yet, the redeemed in glorified bodies. What they offer is the gospel, the key to eternal life in the ""new heavens and new earth, the home of righteousness"" (2 Peter 3:13). By ""the redeemed in glorified bodies"" I'm referring to the glorious bodies that are promised to believers at the time of their bodily resurrection (1 Cor. 15:42-44); these bodies will be imperishable, powerful and spiritual (not carnal) in nature. Believers will be able to defy gravity with these new bodies, walk through doors and teleport from one place to another, all of which can be observed in Jesus Christ after his resurrection.Needless to say, ""Cocoon"" has an incredible subtext. But it's not necessary to get so deep. This is just an entertaining movie with a good heart. More than that, it's inspiring. On the downside, the final act is overextended and should've been trimmed down.The film runs 1 hour, 57 minutes, and was shot in the Clearwater/St. Petersburg area of Florida with the underwater scenes done in the Bahamas.GRADE: A-",Cocoon
22,zetes,Pretty good,7,20 March 2011,"Pretty decent light sci-fi, kind of like E.T. except with old people instead of children. Brian Dennehy plays an alien come to Earth looking for cocoons left in the ocean a long time ago by their race. The cocoons they find are placed in an indoor pool next door to an old folk's home, and a few rascally old men (Wilford Brimley, Hume Cronyn and Don Ameche) sneak in and use the pool. The water has become rejuvenating, and the three men, along with their wives on subsequent visits, become reinvigorated. Steve Guttenberg plays a ship captain whom the aliens hire to take them out to sea, and Raquel Welch's gorgeous daughter, Tahnee Welch, plays one of the aliens for whom Guttenberg falls. Don Ameche somehow won an Oscar for his role, most likely for a silly break dancing sequence which he obviously did not perform. In my mind, Jack Gilford, as the guys' buddy who refuses to go into the pool, is the best actor in the film, though I don't think anyone deserved an Oscar nomination for it.",Cocoon

25,lasttimeisaw,Cocoon,6,5 March 2012,"An E.T. fairytale for the elderly with a rejuvenating therapeutic gambit for visual and subconscious entertainment and a belated fulfillment to slam the ageism towards the senior. Setting against a Sci-Fi backdrop, the special effects might not be cutting-edge even at its time (in a post-STAR WARS era, it is an insurmountable pinnacle, the same could be deduced now are in a post-AVATAR era), but serves benevolently to entice the concentrations and unleash a wacky but improbable plot of the expedition to the mystifying eternal longevity. The extra- congenial extraterrestrial Antareans are merely a wishful thinking, as human behavior has no exception will spoil their plan to rescue their companions sooner or later, their counter- behavior is inexplicably dumbfounded to be taken seriously. The film has locked two Oscars, one for the visual effects, another is an utterly surprising Best Supporting Actor win for Don Ameche (whose pivotal showcase is a stupendous street-dance stunt in the film, apart from which there is scant room for him to testify his flair), which could be divined that it is no more than an acclaim to the film's pandering penchant for the demography as most academic members are over-50 white male, this film might help them to mitigate the fear of aging uselessly and hopelessly. Anyway the entire prestigious cast has stuck together to make the indulging fantasy more refreshing than off-putting, ironically the film itself has not aging too well, unlike the characters in the sanitarium, after a minimal 27 years span, it seems that the film backfires on Ron Howard and the team behind it, who in my opinion is an excellent Hollywood hack than a venerable filmmaker.",Cocoon
26,Robert_duder,Eighties fluff fantasy that is cute but nothing spectacular,7,10 February 2008,"Cocoon by some is considered utter eighties classic and its understandable why. There isn't a lot like it. You have a cast of movie and theater greats past their presumed prime all getting together in a movie that is essentially about aliens. Plus you throw in the eighties camp acting great Steve Guttenberg, and you got yourselves a bonafide hit!! I happen to think that as cute and fluffy and perhaps even classic that it is...its not that great but Cocoon fulfills a certain entertainment quota with a really strong cast, with really terrific chemistry. Its like an ET for adults. Certainly you can't doubt the talent of director Ron Howard who has done some amazing work in his time although Cocoon was really one of his early hits following Splash. I think Cocoon hits the familiar note of what life in the eighties was like. The eighties was a time when people wanted THINGS...material goods, youth, vitality, freedom, it was like a materialistic hippie movement and Cocoon plays on that premise. Leaving behind family, friends, everything you've ever known so that you can have no sickness and eternal life is well worth it with just a little bit of sadness. And the idea that being old SUCKS.The cast of Cocoon is nothing short of brilliant. Playing the elder crew that find eternal life are Don Ameche, who won an Oscar for his role as free spirited and spunky Arthur Selwyn. I think the Oscar is a little much but his character is still blast. The incomparable Wilford Brimley as level headed leader Ben. Hume Cronyn as spirited womanizer Joseph Finley, who probably gives one of the best performances. He was nominated for an Oscar in 1945 and if anyone deserved one for Cocoon I think it'd be him. Oscan Nominee Jack Gilford as the sour and doubting Bernard Lefkowitz. Multiple Oscar nominated Maureen Stapleton as Ben's beloved wife. Oscar winner Jessica Tandy is terrific as Cronyn's spirited and scorned wife. The younger crew are played by Steve Guttenberg as the slapstick, comedic boat captain, the amazing Brian Dennehy as the mysterious head of the alien crew Walter, the very sexy and perfect eighties movie girl Tahnee Welch as one of the main alien crew members and the object of Guttenberg's affections.The cast works so well together in kind of a silly story but its still a feel good cutesy kind of deal. The young cast just mesh so perfectly with the older cast and everyone is terrific. I could have done without Guttenberg, one of the most over rated and over used actors of the eighties. He kind of made serious moments a joke and it just felt like he was demeaning all the talent in this film. The film does have some emotion behind it but its just kind of surface emotion before moving on to something. Cocoon won't ever be ground breakingly brilliant but its cute and fun and apparently Oscar worthy but it probably seemed like the most opportune moment to bestow Oscars on an aging but brilliant cast. If you haven't seen Cocoon then of course you should but likely you won't be blown away by it. Its just okay. 7/10",Cocoon

The performances of Don Ameche, Wilford Brimley, and Hume Cronyn are the main charm of this film.

28,vincentlynch-moonoi,The cast of seniors makes this a special film,7,15 March 2014,"After reading many of the reviews here, I wish to compliment our reviewer FilmFlaneur, who really seems to ""get"" what this film is about. Even the title of his review -- ""Charming fable..."" -- hits the nail on the head.I think what some other reviewers need to refocus on is: what story did Ron Howard decide to tell us? After all, there are many directions this film's basic premise could have gone in. For example, it could have become a science fiction film, but instead, Howard told a story that only depended on a science fiction substrate. The real focus here is actually human life ON EARTH. How do humans react to growing old.What a wonderful ensemble of actors portray a wonderfully interesting group of old codgers. The gem, of course, was the almost forgotten Don Ameche...for my money, one of the most underrated actors in American cinema; what a joy to savor Ameche's acting here, and to rejoice in a career renewed. Wilford Brimley...not a favorite of mine...is just right here. Hume Cronyn and Jessica Tandy, a real-life married couple that always brought joy and dignity to their roles. Jack Gilford, interesting as always. Gwen Verdon, another mostly forgotten actor who did very nicely here. So how are these old folks going into that good night? There's all variations here...just as there probably would be in real life.The aliens' characters are less well developed. I've never been a fan of Brian Dennehy, but he does nicely here as the leader of the aliens. Tahnee Welch has a decent amount of screen time, but it's a plot device, not the development of a character. Interestingly, Tyrone Power, Jr., son of Tyrone Power, is another of the aliens, but he mostly just stands around looking not as strikingly handsome as his father.The special effects here are pretty decent, especially considering that this was filmed nearly 30 years ago. Some of the special effects impressed me, others did not. But the special effects people did their jobs to help tell the story effectively.I found the ending a bit of a let down. I guess we just had to have faith that the seniors made the right decision to go with the aliens. It would have been nice had Ron Howard done a sequel to tell us the next part of the story. Steve Guttenburg, as the skipper of the yacht, is just kinda left there in the Gulf Of Mexico in a rather difficult legal position. What happened to him? So much more of a story could have been told.But, I'm not complaining. This was and is a satisfying film. A gem. Highly recommended.",Cocoon

These cocoons had been resting at the bottom of the ocean. They hire a boat from a local captain Jack (Steve Guttenberg) who helps them retrieve the cocoons.

Problems arise when three elderly people, Art (Don Ameche) Ben (Wilford Brimley) and Joe (Hume Cronyn) from a nearby retirement community have been secretly using the pool, and who discover a new lease of life after using the pool with the cocoons in it.All the lead cast are brilliant and Brian Dennehy is as excellent as always. Every time I see him on screen I warm to Steve Guttenberg, and I can't help but wonder what happened to his career, and looking on here, he didn't make a movie from 1990 (A sequel to ""3 Men & A Baby"") till 1995.

Today we just satisfy ourselves with surviving a few more years.The vision of extraterrestrials as more advanced than us and unable not to remember when they were born and when one has died in their vicinity is plainly absurd. No living organism can live forever nor have Biblical life spans.But what's more to consider it is normal and acceptable that a bunch of oldies actually murder by carelessness and breaking and entering two extraterrestrials is outrageous. It is murder, at least manslaughter, even if these superior organisms are extraterrestrials and not men, or women.And to see all these oldies rushing to the extraterrestrial promise of eternal life and no diseases is so pathetic that we dream of not getting that senile later on in our lives. Parkinson's or Alzheimer's are OK, but not that egotistic, self-centered, and careless about other people.This film should disappear in the big drawer of historically rejected cultural productions for lack of cultural value and human depth.Dr. Jacques COULARDEAU",Cocoon
32,Movie_Muse_Reviews,"A rare and truthful focus on the elderly makes ""Cocoon"" a nice film",6,2 January 2010,"Very few films have been made with seniors as the main characters. It seems that Hollywood producers are convinced we prefer to see younger people on the screen -- and they're probably right. ""Cocoon"" is a rare elderly-focused take on the fountain of youth concept, an ancient motif that's enough proof in itself that humans desire young age, whether in general or at the movies. Although science fiction, ""Cocoon"" is simple and mild-mannered like its lovable old protagonists. It might be light on drama but it's big on heart.Loaded with stars from yesteryear, among them Don Ameche, Hume Cronyn, Jessica Tandy and Gwen Verdon, one could say ""Cocoon"" was an '80s alien movie made specifically for an older crowd. And that's fair -- they deserve it. It's as if director Ron Howard was hoping to give his cast some of their youth back in letting them take prominence in the film, based on a story by David Saperstein and screenplay by Tom Benedek. It's not riveting sci-fi material but it prompts an honest conversation about aging, one that in reality someone of any age could understand and appreciate.The film takes place in a senior living center in St. Petersburg, Florida. As part of their recreation time, three of the senior men enjoy swimming in the abandoned pool just through the woods around the center. When a strange group of people come in and buy the old house and rent a boat at the dock, the stubborn old guys still come to swim in the pool, only it appears the people are storing rocks in the water. They swim anyway and find that with the rocks in the pool (actually alien cocoons) that they feel energetic, rejuvenated -- and younger.Howard's film is easygoing. There is not a lot of suspense or gripping conflict. Instead, you watch and get a kick out of the way these seniors and their wives behave having been affected by the water. Their sex drive, for example, reappears to comic effect and there's general misbehavior. They all come off as bigger children and each have a different reaction to this ""cheating"" of age. Thus the film's core conflict of whether it's right to defy nature appears and guides the rest of the film. It's a replacement for any major form of antagonism.""Cocoon"" is touching because the story is very frank in portraying these seniors as having nothing to live for but each other and whatever remaining family they have. When you're that old, a chance at prolonged life is like being granted a whole new world of opportunity whereas you're just biding time when you're old and physically and mentally unable to do the things you used to.There have been better stories, better special effects (although this one an Oscar in 1985) and better science-fiction films, so ""Cocoon"" is best appreciated as a unique film about old age, something movies rarely focus entirely upon.~Steven CVisit my site! http://moviemusereviews.com",Cocoon

I don't know if I'd swim in a pool that has moss-covered boulders tossed into it, but these guys do, and find their youthful vitality returning.Unbeknownst to the men, aliens on a mission have rented the neighbor's place, and set up the pool as their base of operations. Fortunately, these were post-ET/Close Encounters beings, so they had benevolent intentions.Great cast of some familiar faces, and the screen chemistry of the cast members is wonderful as they range from highly emotional to contentious in their interaction. The nursing home residents are marvelous in portraying their renewed joy of life. Don Ameche is dashing with the ladies, and acts the role of a youthful character very well. Hume Cronyn, Jessica Tandy, Mareen Stapleton, and Wilford Brimley are all great. However, the movie is certainly not all a feel-good warm fuzzies type of story; there are some sad tragedies that occur as the plot moves forward. My one criticism is that the film lacks the courage to address its central theme, the idea of eternal life, only skirting its ramifications. Only one character rejects the idea, but generic platitudes (like ""belonging here"") he says explain nothing of his reasoning. The film doesn't analyze the people who desire immortality enough, either. We get a few morsels about missing baseball, fishing, and grandchildren. But this shallow analysis gives insufficient insight to this infinitely critical decision the characters are faced with.It's an interesting tale, with a bittersweet message about our own mortality.

40,vip_ebriega,Enjoyable ET-inspired fable.,8,18 September 2008,"My Take: The all-star veteran cast is the selling point, but it's also a sweeping story about life and love. Ever since audiences were awe-struck with Steven Spielberg's heart-warming and crowd-pleasing E.T. THE EXTRA-TERRESTRIAL, many rip-offs and knock-offs tried to duplicate the success of the film (What blockbuster hit wouldn't). It's easy to consider Ron Howard's COCOON as a part of this cycle, but this is a very different tale all together. Sure it has aliens (that clearly looks like guys in an alien suit surrounded by animated lights) that came in peace. Sure it has a kid with a mother very worried of him suddenly running-off. Sure it clearly wanted to be the classic that E.T. was. But COCOON also has fine acting (by a veteran, all-star cast), a touching story and some very humorous and sometimes uplifting moments that make it a spellbinding tale.COCOON is much less a sci-fi movie than it is a drama, and a brilliant one at that. Howard provides both humor and touching tear-jerking moments and handles them both very well. Then it leaves the all-star cast to give the performances of their career (Don Ameche is at his peak when he boogies like John Travolta in one scene). The story concerns the arrival of peaceful extra-terrestrial beings, disguised as normal human beings, who aid the help of a skipper (Steve Guttenberg) to find one of their friends trapped in the ocean floor. Upon finding them, they are placed in a small swimming pool the next day. Coincidentally, a couple of elders swim in the pool, who are then endowed with youthful energy, giving them a chance to enjoy the last remains of their life they way they wanted to.As played by one of the best acting veterans he can handle, Howard's fantasy is a funny, poignant and simply charming fairy tale for the older set packed with laughs (seeing these old guys and gals party about like a couple of college buddies are warm and funny) and heart-breaking drama (the scenes where they discover the perils of time and age can't help but be tear-jerking). Howard is especially good at handling the film with originality, not looking at E.T. even for a minute. It ain't a flawless classic as the other film is, but it is nonetheless a very charming movie that much deserves a revisit.Rating: **** out of 5.",Cocoon
41,harry-76,In the Spielberg Era,5,19 July 2001,"Ten years after Stephen Spielberg released his landmark scifi thriller, ""Jaws"" Ron Howard brought out this comedy/scifi entry, ""Cacoon.""It seems once a precedent is set in Hollywood film making, all coming thereafter must either follow in the new  model's footsteps or take up where it left off.  Accordingly, every genre effort after 1975's ""Jaws"" began to look alike.

And the actors, too, seem to fall in line, caught up in the sytlistic spell of Stephen. As for the plot situations, writers now seem obliged to create ever more fantastic yarns and effects.  Indeed, when E.T. took off on his bike into space, that signaled a new era in imagination.  Now in the 21st century, we have our heros and heroines scaling 90 degree walls and soaring through tree tops with the ease of skipping down quaint village lanes of yore.Where it will end is anyone's guess, and Ron Howard does his best with ""Cacoon.""  To be sure, it doesn't have the quality of Spielberg's better efforts, but it does try hard -- and the added ingredient of comedy really helps the proceedings. A cast of stalwart veterans combine with more youthful aspirants to create some mixed, yet often interesting, results.",Cocoon
42,gab-14712,Surprisingly Sweet and Sentimental!,8,13 June 2020,"1985's Cocoon is a fine science-fiction movie, if not a little on the sentimental side. The main players are all elderly characters, so this movie appeals to the older crowd. As a younger person, I enjoyed the Spielbergian science fiction and charm you come to expect out of a Spielberg production. There is no frenetic pacing or any complicated plot mechanics. Ron Howard's direction is laidback, smooth, and often goes with the flow.The film was originally going to be helmed by Robert Zemeckis. Twentieth Century Fox, the studio behind the film, was also behind Zemeckis's first big-budget adventure, Romancing with the Stone. The studio hated that movie and fired him (and that film turned out to be a big critical and commercial success) and hired Ron Howard to take his place. Howard previously directed the fast-paced comedy The Night Shift and the magical Splash. After what he did with the mermaid movie, the studio believed Howard was the right man for this film. I was surprised that at such a young age and relatively inexperienced, Howard would have the chops to make a laidback, charming film about senior citizens finding the fountain of youth. He did and did an excellent job! The script was written by David Saperstein and the script was solid.Art Selwyn (Don Ameche), Ben Luckett (Wilford Brimley), and Joe Finley (Hume Cronyn) are three elderly residents of a nursing home. There is an abandoned building nearby with a pool and they spend their leisurely time trespassing. One day, the pool and the building are mysteriously purchased. The pool now has these strange rocks at the bottom (which are these alien cocoons). They still decide to keep swimming, but now these cocoons are making them feel young again. Their adventures are now just beginning.For a science-fiction film from a major studio, it was highly unusual for a movie to have such an elderly cast minus a few exceptions. It worked out very well as the film was one of the highest grossing films of 1985. The performances are all sweet and rather sentimental. The actors did an excellent job showing and talking about aging, but they also used comedic effect to show how they are ""young"" again. Don Ameche is the film's standout and actually won an Oscar for his performance. Wilford Brimley was only 50 when the film was released, so he spent time in the makeup chair in order to look old. Jessica Tandy and Maureen Stapleton delivered fine performances. As for the younger actors, keep an eye out for Steve Guttenberg and Brian Dennehy.Cocoon is not the best science-fiction movies of the 80's, but it is a perfectly watchable movie that is sometimes a bit sentimental. It's one of those films you may forget long after you watched it, but you have fun watching it as it unfolds. James Horner created a recognizable theme that you will not forget. The special effects are hit-and-miss. They do not hold up as well today. Ron Howard's directing prowess matured with Cocoon. I was pleasantly surprised.My Grade: B",Cocoon

44,Maziun,A tale about aging and dying,5,1 November 2013,"""Cocoon"" is one of the science fiction movies made on the popularity of Steven Spielberg's ""E.T."" . The other are John Carpenter's ""Starman"" , John Badham's ""Short circuit"" and Matthew Robbins ""Batteries not included"". All are family friendly comedies that have good special effects , humor and heart.""Cocoon"" is a lighthearted comedy about serious issues like aging, immortality and death. It's one of those rare Hollywood movies where old people are the main hero's of the story. Sure , there is Steve Guttenberg here , but he's a supporting character and a comic relief for the teenage audiences. I also like the appearance of Brian Dennehy (""Rambo : First blood"") and sexy Tahnee Welch.Don Ameche , Wilford Brimley , Jessica Tandy , Hume Cronyn and Jack Gilford – the old generation actors are the stars here. They have good chemistry together and really make you care for their characters.I don't think that Don Ameche deserved the Oscar for his performance. I like him , he's a good actor and he's good here , but the Oscar feels here more like a tribute for his overall career than for this particular performance.The special effects are great even after all those years (they won Oscar). Sure , some of the effects do look a little fake now , but most of them are outstanding – for example the alien in the cocoon . Add to that a great music by James Horner (a little too sweet maybe) and prepare yourself for audio-visual pleasure.As I mentioned earlier this movie isn't one that takes itself too seriously . It tells important truth – you're as old as you feel. Yes , aging and death are painful , but you should use life to the maximum and live with dignity to the end.I recommend this movie to everyone – especially old people . People who like darker and more serious science fiction movies might be disappointed with this one , but anyone with open mind and heart probably will enjoy it. I give it 5/10.",Cocoon

These are all veteran actors and their performances in this film reflect their experience. In short, this is a very well-acted, written and directed film. The story is a touching one, with elements of all sorts of emotions and human interactions. There is real depth to the story and the film can be watched on one of several levels and enjoyed on each level. If you're looking for just a good entertaining story, it is that.

46,raymond-15,Interesting and thought-provoking,7,9 August 2004,"Made 20 years ago with some former well-known actors, this film has stood the test of time very well and delivers a very interesting and thought-provoking story about the mortality of man.A group of people in a retirement village discover a neighbouring swimming pool which is out of bounds, but they have fun in it nevertheless.  There are some strange objects lying on the bottom of the pool, but even more strange is the fact that after swimming there the old folk feel transformed and the vigor of their youth returns to their bodies. This makes for some light comedy as their hormones begin to take over.These old people have a very serious decision to make and it is not an easy one. This is probably the best part of the film. Should they accept or decline the invitation? Having made the decision there is no turning back! We ask ourselves...what would we do placed in their circumstances? We feel very much involved. Thinking it over, isn't this proposal very much like what the Christian churches are promising us?The final memorial church service by the sea is such a fitting ending and the little grandson David gives such a knowing smile as he raises his eyes to the sky.",Cocoon
47,emm,"A different breed of science fiction, with the warm touch.",7,8 May 1999,"COCOON is not at all similar to every other science fiction movie (the ending is a pure exception), but this uses fantasy and magic as a way to express a heartwarmth feeling. What happens when the good elderly citizens of a retirement community discover the ""fountain of youth""? It's movies like this going away from the perilous trap and concentrates deeply on our human characteristics. A large cast of older stars, including the late couple Hume Cronyn and Jessica Tandy, contribute to the warmth and amusement of a non-violent ""sci-fi"" picture that is a breed apart from the rest. They act as if they're ""young again"" with incredible energy, and the moments offer the kind and gentle possibilities that wouldn't redeem this as science fiction, but it is. Ron ""Ritchie"" Howard gives this a whole new acclaim for internally giving us the human spirit that lies within an outside force. For those who crave hard on science fiction, COCOON is a slight misunderstanding due to the light-hearted story it has to offer. What's more entertaining than seeing old folks push over the limits of their acting potential? As Wilford Brimley once said in Quaker Oats commercials, ""It's the right thing to do."". Which also means COCOON is the right movie for showing off a different dimension of our feelings inside. And different is right!",Cocoon

From the very first time that I have seen this movie it has deeply moved me. The whole story is wonderful and the characters are all portrayed by an ensemble of wonderful elderly actors. This film is extremely heart warming and it always brings tears to my eyes!! This is definitely one of Ron Howard's best and most under-appreciated film. If you enjoyed films like ""E.T."", and ""Starman"", Cocoon is a must see. I guarantee anyone that they will be glad they gave it a try after viewing this film. ****1/2 out of *****.",Cocoon
49,SkullScreamerReturns,If you want a family-friendly sci-fi movie,5,17 October 2020,"I've seen the Cocoon dvd in stores and everwhere time and time again, and the poster looks cool, so I finally gave it a shot. I expected a little more of a sci-fi flick, and while there's some of that in general I'd describe this as a family flick and drama-comedy. The story is quite interesting and there's good acting. The special effects haven't aged very well and I felt like it brought the overall quality down a bit, but then again it's not the worst computer graphics for the time. It just feels a bit too cartoony and thus brings the whole thing a bit too far into a ""children's movie"" territory if you ask me.I liked that Steve Guttenberg (Mahoney from Police Academy) is involved. For some reason I remember never seeing him in any other roles outside the Police Academy series, even though it seems he's done a lot of movies. Maybe he just operates outside my usual genre preference.It's difficult to rate Cocoon because I see that it's quite well made film and some people will probably love it but it wasn't entirely my cup of tea. The tone is a bit too sentimental, and especially the orchestral music is used to give the scenes a larger than life touching feeling but it makes me feel like an overdose of Disney sugar. Don't get me wrong I've usually been into sentimental happy endings and corny stuff like that but somehow it goes a bit overboard with this one.If you want a warm drama-comedy with a little bit of sci-fi/fantasy thrown in, that you can watch with your entire family, then this is a good choice. As for myself, I'd rather pick something with a little bit more edge.",Cocoon
50,jldmp1,Prune Juice,5,7 August 2006,"The attempt here was to build something topical around legends: legends about Atlantis, the Fountain of Youth, alien visitation...and movie legends. Note how screen/dance legends Fred and Ginger are featured here, and particularly Fred with the ""Dancing in the Dark"" connection from ""The Band Wagon"". The late, great Ameche is here to tie all of this together via the big band ballroom dances, and to wink at us with modern b-boy power moves. Otherwise, this is silly. The dialogue openly acknowledges how silly the alien bits are -- the humans don't want to know more about them. And it's a rather tepid morality play, about as dry as a Talmudic discussion. The aliens are plainly post-""E.T."", and somewhat post-""Starman"", and have ridiculous 'Tinkerbell' fairy dust trails. The jokes center on virile old codgers, long before Viagra.If Howard were an inventor -- which he isn't -- he could have kept the great references to the classics and revealed as little as necessary about the aliens...something ""2001""-ish. ""Awakenings"" is a smarter example of the rejuvenation of movie classics within a larger movie.",Cocoon
51,Coffee_in_the_Clink,Excruciatingly boring. The script could have done with a swim in that pool,2,17 April 2020,"In Florida, a gang of old men at a retirement home make their usual spot of trespassing into a local derelict house with a large swimming pool for a dip. But today, there is something waiting for them in the pool. A rich group of scuba-diving enthusiasts have rented the house for a month and are out on a boat by day taking up large rocks and bringing them back to store in the pool. The old men have a swim, regardless, and find that the waters are rejuvenating. All their aches and illnesses subside, and they waltz back to the home and are the talk of the place. They persuade the wives to join them and fairly soon their sex lives are re-kindled, as well as their general well-being. This is all fine and dandy until the origins of the 'rocks' - which are really alien cocoons - and the identity of these strange, rich scuba-diving enthusiasts, are revealed to them...This is one extremely boring movie. The script is very weak and Ron Howard showed little effort in doing what the pool does for the old men here and adding some life in to it. Essentially, this is two hours of old folks swimming, dancing and jumping off diving boards, with some very silly looking aliens with pathetic sharp lights shooting out of them.

53,fimimix,..lovely fairytale for older folk (me)..,10,17 August 2006,"I've read all of the other comments and agree with all of them, plus ! I give the movie ""Cocoon"" a 10, because it's silly and fun, touching and realistic, well-acted and directed by Ron Howard. Dave Saperstein's script is a little nutty, but delightful. I didn't see who wrote the score, but it's lovely.Don Ameche deserved his Oscar, and some of the other cast-members should have been nominated, too - if for no other reason for the long number of years they gave to movie-goers in this country.Wilford Brimley (Ben) really held the story together, and did his role well, especially in scenes with his grandson. Hume Cronyn and Jessica Tandy have appeared in more roles than all these guys put together, and certainly added brilliance to the story. Maureen Stapleton and Jack Gilford were very good. Gwen Verdon - that fabulous dancing-lady in many Broadway shows - was painted like a young gal and had the most modern coifs......looked good and was great in the dance sequences. Chita Rivera paid her the highest compliment just this week for KCET's fund-raising program - said dancing with her was one of the highlights of her career.Young'uns, it is my opinion that older people defeat their sexual prowess by accepting the general public's denigration, themselves - but, I'm glad those guys found ""the fountain of youth"" and enjoyed it while they could. NOW, although he was the youngest actor in the cast, it is also my opinion Steve Guttenberg's character was ""sexed-up"" to the hilt.....lots of scenes without shirts, always tight trunks, lots of ""pretty-boy"" shots.....I was certain his ""boner"" was going to hang-out of his shorts at any time.....it was constantly visible.The cinematography of underwater scenes of ""Atlantis"" were gorgeous, and the camera was used effectively to show how the ""cocoons"" were taken out of the water and put back in it. Wouldn't we all like to find such a magic pool? The return of the spaceship was used effectively for the few ""alien"" aspects of the film, and certainly gave Brian Dennehy the opportunity to cap a well-played role. Another added excitement was the grandson being on the boat, wanting to go - then realizing his life was with his mother. All those Coast Guard boats were a lead-up to the thrill of the ""boat"" being drawn-up into the spaceship.....maybe they WERE going to heaven.......Not one violent scene in the movie, and EVERYONE loved it. What a ""feel-good"" movie!, and one for all people to contemplate how they'll handle their old-age........how you do really IS in your head. I'm 82-going-on-18 and loving it all.

59,Dandy_Desmond,Magical,9,31 July 2010,"Cocoon could have been very depressing and parts of it are very emotional and sad but beautifully handled. It deals with subjects that are quite difficult to sell - being old, facing the death of loved ones or coming to the end of your own time. However thankfully its also very funny contains great well rounded characters and has some great music from James Horner. Steve Guttenbergs character owns a boat and does crappy tours but is struggling to make ends meet and is down on his luck. Enter four mysterious strangers asking him to take them to a certain point in the ocean with no questions asked. He agrees and while spying on the pretty female played by Tahnee Welch (mmmmm!) he finds out they are actually Aliens retrieving Cocoons containing their friends that have lain at the bottom of the sea for thousands of years. Intercutting with this we have the story of an old peoples home and a group of friends biding their time until death takes them as it takes the people around them one by one. Three life long friends (Ameche, Brimley and Cronin)sneak into a local pool and relax but one day find the pool full of cocoons. After their swim they gain a new lease of life - they all get their libido back, their health and their sense of joy in life. I won't go into detail but what made this an enjoyable film for me was the characters. Each of the friends had their own background, their own questions and concerns as to what was happening and their new lease of life had a different effect on each of them. For example I loved how Hume Cronins character at the beginning was dying of cancer - you felt sorry for him as a sick old man, then when the pool cures him you find out as he gets his sex drive back he has an eye for the ladies and cheats on his wife and that its not the first time as he has treat her badly this way before. I also loved the relationship between Wilford Brimleys character and Barret Oliver. You felt a real grandfather - grandson bond between them. Special mention to the other friend in the group - the eternally grouchy Bernie who refuses to go in the pool or let his sick wife. After the old folks run rampant the energy from the cocoons is drained and the pool stops working its magic - then Bernies wife dies and he Carry's her to the pool begging for it to bring her back. Its pretty heart wrenching stuff for the likes of me. Thankfully though although sometimes I did have a tear in my eye there was some laughter to go along with it. The interplay between the old folks is very funny and its a joy to see them change from old codgers to teenagers overnight and I find Steve Guttenberg amusing as well. Overall I found Cocoon a very entertaining film. Emotional, sad, beautiful, funny and above all memorable. Sadly most of the cast is gone but through their work they live on.",Cocoon

The moment they hit the water, they feel strangely but wonderfully rejuvenated. Things are fine until the owners get back. Meanwhile, a local marine tour guide struggling to make ends meet comes across a group of people willing to hire him and his boat. Things are fine until he discovers they're not quite what they seem.The best sci-fi films are often those that have nothing really to do with sci-fi, but use the genre to tell a story in ways that would be otherwise impossible. The core of a sci-fi film has to be about people if it's going to resonate with the audience. This is just what 'Cocoon' does, dealing with issues familiar to us all - life and death. If another shot at life came along, what happens next? Equally, the film explores what life can become for people post-retirement, the 'can' being emphasised, because 'Cocoon' has a positive message. Life is what you make it, and only you can decide whether it's time to lie down and wait for death, not anyone else. But if you're not used to making that effort, it can be scary to take risks.With a cast of people like Don Ameche, Brian Dennehy, and Jessica Tandy, you know the acting side of things is in good hands. The only weak link in the chain for me is Steve Guttenberg, whose breathless nervous clowning works great in the likes of 'Police Academy' and 'High Spirits', but feels out of place here. Maybe it's because he's surrounded by older more experienced actors who take things a bit more seriously, but then he's clearly meant to be the youthful comic relief - the same way Barret Oliver is an obvious attempt to draw the youth demographic. A little more confidence in the script would have shown these things to be unnecessary. James Horner has never to my knowledge turned in a bad score. This one has the sound of his grandiose Star Trek II and III efforts, being of the same period, and fitting the drama nicely. Director Ron Howard ensures that even when he's not using Industrial Light & Magic to achieve visual splendour, he's using more down-to-earth backgrounds like sunsets to equal effect.It's rare I come across a sci-fi film I could watch with my grandparents, but then as I said, it's not really about the sci-fi.

They start to get stronger and their internal clocks have been turned back decades. Unknowingly to them aliens (including Brian Dennehy and Tahnee Welch) have placed cocoons (with a certain life-force) into the pool that they must take back to their own planet.I know, I know it does sound quite silly, but every actor and actress put in a great performance. It is also a very warm film and really has a good heart. To me this is a science fiction film disguised as a drama. Meaning you might not need to be a giant sci-fi fan to really enjoy it. It brings laughs, tears and even some pain.Not only did Don Ameche win an Oscar for his performance I think he also won Best Break Dance of '85. That scene where he and Gwen Verdon hit a night club to do some dancing always gets me laughing. Also won an Oscar for Visual Effects, which in my opinion do not look too bad thirty plus years later.

63,TVholic,Another under-appreciated gem,9,1 April 2001,"""Do not go gentle into that good night, Old age should burn and rave at close of day; Rage, rage against the dying of the light."" - Dylan ThomasThe senior characters of this modern day fable took this poem to heart.When we first meet the motley group, they are as many of us dread one day becoming. Kept in a nursing home, days filled with vapid activities like shuffleboard or mah-jongg, whiling away hours floating in a deserted swimming pool, watching people your own age drop like flies. When that changes through the magic of alien technology, they become, if not the picture of reckless youth, at least a semblance of the people they were once upon a time, proving the old cliché: you ARE only as old as you feel. In that, it's a good lesson for people heading into their golden years or even those of us just having midlife crises. We can't help but grow old. But it's up to us whether we want to BE old or merely mature.For a science fiction movie, it would appear to have few special effects. This is an illusion. There are quite a few effects shots, although the variety of effects is rather limited. The glowing aliens are quite good except for the all too familiar hand movements by Caprice Rothe, who first did the job for ""E.T."" Still, by and large the effects are impressive and convincing even when compared against the latest films of the 21st century. Even more impressive was the poolhouse, which was hastily constructed purely as a setpiece for the movie. It looks absolutely real, as if it had sat there among the Florida palms for decades.Tahnee Welch, daughter of the seemingly ageless Raquel, was wholesomely fetching here. Whether she was a limited actress or merely underplaying the role is for others to decide. Ron Howard wisely kept Steve Guttenberg's role limited, focusing mainly on the older characters. A little Guttenberg goofiness goes a long way. Also present are the standard Howard family repertory, with brother Clint as the nursing home attendant and father Rance making a brief appearance as a detective. Much as already been said about the excellent performances of the older cast members. This was, after all, the role that finally won an Oscar for Don Ameche. But they're slowly slipping away from us, one by one. First Jack Gilford, then Ameche, then Jessica Tandy and recently Gwen Verdon. At least we'll have this movie to remember them by. Maybe they weren't at the peaks of their careers, but quite possibly the roles they fit most comfortably.Two attempts to cash in on this movie failed. Both 1987's ""*batteries Not Included,"" starring Tandy and Cronyn, and the 1988 sequel ""Cocoon: The Return"" flopped. Neither had the genuine warmth of this original. Ron Howard showed good judgement in turning down the chance to direct the sequel.As for the musical score, it's one of James Horner's better works, mixing symphonic grandeur with childlike wonderment. Alas, he does fall into old habits and reuse some bars and measures from his ""Wolfen"" and ""Star Trek II"" scores.It's a shame this movie never found the audience it deserved. I first saw this in a shopping mall four-plex a couple of weeks after its release. There couldn't have been more than 20 people in the entire theater. The whole movie holds up remarkably well in the 16 years since, except for the break dancing. My god, has it been 16 years already? Where can I find some Antarean life force?",Cocoon

How would you know that that big interstellar ship won't break in the way letting those folks flying in the middle of the galaxy with no medic care and soap operas reception? Really. I know for a fact that there's no Champs Elysees on planet Antarea. Anyhow, the film is saved by the - for once - very nice and slow to get angry E.T.'s, admirably nice and easy going. And to call Tahnee Welch sweet and hot is just to use more pleonasms than is needed.Cocoon is cheesy and careless, and in my book also useless. How better would have been to dump the martians, and just let it be a history for older people with a similar scenario. That's what I would've bought.",Cocoon
67,alfredpr-69611,"Cocoon, you'll Want to Crawl in One",1,3 May 2020,"I cant tell you how boring this movie is. I recorded it on DVR from TCM and erased it halfway through the first viewing. It was whiny old people and the worst looking aliens ever.
I wish I had a dvd so I could break it.",Cocoon
68,IMSandman,Great Entertaining Film,8,10 July 2003,"I just finished watching this movie again on TV.   While many people may view this film and consider it a movie about a bunch of old people and some aliens, that is only part of the story.   This movie is deeper than that with a underlying theme about life and death. Is it better to live a ""regular"" life on earth or to live forever and forsake your family and loved ones to achieve this immortality?  This ideal is exemplified by the character of Bernie (watch and see).  
The rest of the movie is full of lighthearted humor and some very moving moments that will bring tears to your eyes.  Outstanding movie with great special effects for its time.   8.5 Stars.",Cocoon

70,mbuchwal,Inspired by a Classic,6,14 July 2005,"""Cocoon"" is a fine example of how films have everything to do with their predecessors. Ron Howard, the director, acted as a child in a ""Twilight Zone"" episode and his film ""Cocoon"" could almost be a feature length remake of another ""Twilight Zone"" episode called ""Kick the Can,"" which is very similar in concept, mood and effect, except it has no element of outer space aliens. This is not a criticism though, the story idea is a classic one and well done in its updating. For many viewers much of the appeal came from the appearance among the cast of former matinée idols, an approach which has also worked well in a number of other films made since the end of the ""Golden Age.""",Cocoon
71,Sweet Charity,What Can I Say? I love these people...,10,27 May 2001,"Cocoon has got to be just about the CUTEST movie I have ever seen!  What's cuter than a bunch of older people running around, dancing and hanging out with aliens?  Although I'm not a big fan of Wilford Brimley, he and Maureen Stapleton did a great job with their roles!  I'm also not a big Steve Guttenberg fan... but he's so funny whenever he finds out that he's on a boat with aliens.  ""I never accused you of being dishonest!  I accuse you of being from another planet... BUT AN HONEST PLANET!""  Jessica Tandy & Hume Cronyn are one of the cutest couples I have ever seen!  They always do such fantastic jobs, especially Jessica.  (Who else do you know that can play old lady with alzheimers/lady in nursing home who tells stories about people who barbeque dead bodies/lady being attacked by birds?)  Jack Gilford is great in his role as the crabby Bernie.  And of course, Don Ameche and Gwen Verdon... how awesome are they?!  (Especially Gwen... just watch her dance in this movie... I'd like to be able to move like that at 60!)  Like Jessica and Hume, they are always great in whatever they do!  Funny how every time I hear Don's voice I think of a golden retriever... and every time I hear Gwen I want to break into a rendition of ""Whatever Lola Wants.""  :o)  Thumbs up to Ron Howard for his direction!  These people look like they're having such a ball... be sure to catch this movie next time it's on!",Cocoon
72,ericventura,Old People and Aliens,3,28 June 2017,"What could have been a simple disaster movie took a late turn into the depths of mysteriousness and emotional ignorance. Like a horrible aftertaste, Cocoon starts out well and turns sour halfway into the meal. What Jaws (1975) did, Ron Howard decided not to do. Trading in simplicity for a screenplay of old people and aliens, he attempts to weave a tale of redemption and fate, instead finding himself directing an action movie with no purpose.In fact, this movie has no purpose whatsoever. It says nothing, it accomplishes nothing, and it does nothing. It's a story for telling a story's sake. But where Inside Llewyn Davis (2013) tells a story because of the existence of the story, Cocoon must search out the material to make the story. And the screenplay looks long and hard for that inspiration for a good story – and gives up. So we get a movie with old people and aliens. A story where old people of Earth have more in common with aliens from some distant planet (that have apparently been to Earth already, explaining certain human legends) than with their own kind. But where E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial (1982) makes good use of moral children and friendly aliens, this movie decides to attempt to make a sentimental story with a stupid child and indulgent aliens. But waitthere's more! Don't forget the necessary, underdeveloped, and makes-no-sense-whatsoever love story – in this case between a human and an alien.The beginning was decent however. Howard attempts to construct a slowly building tense storyline of gradually revealed twists. Which works until it feels like the movie should end at around the 80 minute mark instead of the 120 minute mark. The slow sci-fi drama of the first half is quickly overshadowed by the feel-good catastrophe of the second half.Don Ameche was decent, but I think the Academy has something for old people, like Art Carney in Harry and Tonto (1974). While good performances, do they deserve the Academy Award? The visual effects were good for the time and not abused unlike many an action and sci-fi movie of today, not to name names. If only Howard could have kept the slow build up going, like Arrival (2016), he would have had a fine classic entry into the 80s sci-fi movie collection. Now, we just have Cocoon, the classically bad movie.",Cocoon
73,nickelreviews,Never Gets Old (No Pun Intended),10,17 June 2013,"Cocoon was the first big movie Ron Howard directed after Splash. I grew up watching this movie. I've continued watching it (probably over 100 times) and it never gets old! It throws out that question what would older people do if they found the fountain of youth? It's too bad I have to travel back to 1985 to find a truly uplifting film. A movie you can watch that will lift your spirits, and although highly unlikely, is made believable by the great acting that actually landed Don Ameche a Best-Supporting Actor nomination that same year. Cocoon also starred Jessica Tandy, Hume Cronyn, Wilford Brimley, Brian Dennehy, and Steve Guttenberg. I love this movie...always have always will! Reviewed by AN/NR 11-14-11",Cocoon
74,keobeo-taylor,ET for adults.,9,26 December 2019,"Ron Howard's best film. One of the better examples of 80s positive alien films. Ron Howard keeps the acting, camerawork realistic and ditto the dialogue. Not over the top schmaltz but good honest emotion. It is very much like ET but superior in my opinion.",Cocoon
75,henrysarki-2,Pleasant sci-fi,9,21 September 2000,"The premise of this fine science fiction movie is plausible, and its cast of veteran actors makes it a real joy to watch. Don Ameche, who is making a comeback after all these years; the husband and wife team of Hume Cronyn and Jessica Tandy who have played together for ever; Wilford Brimley; Maureen Stapleton and the rest of this wonderful group make together a great combination. I first took notice of Brian Dennehy and his imposing presence in this movie, and he fits well in all his roles, good guy, or bad guy. I enjoyed watching its third re-run years after having seen it for the first time, and enjoyed it just as much. Maybe it's because I'm nearing 80 and I relate to those guys. It seems to be on its way to become a classic, despite its oft repeated ending.",Cocoon
76,davidm02,Good Fountain of Youth premise,7,14 July 2005,"Cocoon was a good sleeper movie for it's time. Take a bunch of old, washed up actors and throw them together in a film that turns out to be entertaining to all ages.Wilford Brimley is great and so is Don Ameche, Hume Cronyn and Jack Guilford and Brian Dennehy and Steve Guttenberg. The old guys (and gals) seem to all work well together. I loved the storyline and the humor and the touching, sad side as well. Those of us who have or had grandparents at the time can relate to their aches and pains and wish that they really could live forever and never get old and never die. WOW...what a planet that would be!!Most movies dealing with the elderly turn out to be depressing or boring, but this hit home with everyone. It gives everyone who is sick or aging hope.",Cocoon
77,jcroucher,Why aren't there more films like this?,9,18 August 2000,Cocoon is a unique movie in many ways.  It is hard to categorise as just a sci-fi or just a comedy.  It successfully melds many different genres.  It moves effortlessly from light-hearted comedy to touching drama.  Full credit should go to Ron Howard's confident and sincere direction and the support he gets from the ensemble cast.  If you like comedy or sci-fi this movie is well worth a look.  Note particularly the excellent score.  Hollywood needs more movies like this!,Cocoon
78,connorwayne,Another Ron Howard Masterpiece!,8,30 November 2012,"What a story! The story of this movie is believable and grabs you! The inner concepts are thoroughly shown in the movie and serves as a decent ""thinker"". Though Guttenberg's performance lacked...Brimley, Dennehy, Ameche, and Welch played their characters flawlessly! Hope and a greater appreciation for life are huge in this film which make it so good. The film leaves you with a great feeling for the future and what lies above us. The quarky comedy throughout does work and actually helps lowering the seriousness of the lives lost to a bearable level for all ages. This could have been an awful wreck but Howard and the actors turn this movie into a grand family classic from the 80's!",Cocoon
79,christopher_zook,"Loved since childhood, just realized something disturbing about Jack Bonner...",9,27 January 2019,"It centers around the fate Steve Guttenberg's character, Jack Bonner at the end of the movie. Seen this many times since childhood, but it dawned on me what the only possible outcome could be for him because he chose to stay. More than likely, Jack Bonner would have been held accountable in the deaths of more than 30 senior citizens, seeing as how they had a memorial/funeral for them with the preacher claiming the boat incident was the reason for their deaths. First of all, when the coast guard started chasing them through the harbor, they had a clear view of the name of his boat, so they're going to find out who he is no matter what. Working out of the harbor, he has to be registered with the harbormaster, so they will investigate. There's the issue of the fog. The coast guard couldn't see what was going on behind it, so they didn't see the spaceship, so they'll never believe him if he tells the truth Then, even though there was thick fog, there were so many coast guard boats, it's more likely they'll first find him floating around in the water in his life raft with the sack full of money given to him by Brian Dennehy's character, Walter, having to explain what happened to 30 plus missing senior citizens last seen alive on his boat he was driving, fleeing authorities, that he basically had a hand in kidnapping. Then he'll have to explain the ""mysterious group of people"" who rented his boat and the pool house next door to the senior home. Being Altereans, there would be no record of their existence on Earth. So, try explaining that to police. Good luck. You really think they're just going to let the guy go with his soaking wet burlap sack of cash, consequence free?? Sorry, but I think Jack Bonner's in a lot of trouble folks...lol",Cocoon

81,rs-nisha,Classic movie of all time!,6,15 December 2011,"I recently learned that this film was directed by Ron Howard. Being a fan of his movies, Ron Howard tests his skill in making this sci-fictional film as realistic as possible. 'Cocoon' as the title of the film goes centers on a group of senior citizens who get unexpected vigor on swimming in their neighbor's pool. A superb cast and Steve Guttenberg of (three men and a baby)fame giving that comedy punch. It is a all time family entertainer. The concept original and considering lot of sci-fiction movies emerged in the 80's , this film still stands for three things- oldies coming in form, exploring the unknown and last purpose in life.",Cocoon

This was the first film I saw her in (obviously) but from what I have read about her since - she certainly kept up here her fabulous acting career in this role.The twists and turns this movie takes are of course more obvious now that it's 2018 - but I was mesmerised by this film as a child.

84,meidego,Story about aliens and their positive effect on some older people on earth.,8,23 July 2007,"This movie is about aliens who bring ""cocoons"" that hold other aliens to the ocean for a while and then must retrieve them and return to their home planet. The aliens change their appearance to look like normal people so as not to be detected. They hire a boat to retrieve these cocoons from the ocean. The retrieved cocoons are then stored temporarily in a swimming pool. A residential community for older people is located near the pool where the cocoons are being held. Some of the older residents decide to ""break into"" the pool area and go swimming. The effect these cocoons have on some older people and the efforts of the aliens to not have their identities revealed is the main storyline. The interactions of the older people and the aliens is the body of the movie. There are some twists and turns making this movie funny, serious, and generally enjoyable. This is a feel-good movie.",Cocoon
85,narvaezt,Cocoon (1985),9,25 July 2012,"I first saw this movie in theaters in 1985. I never forgot it. It is really a great movie that has stayed in my mind all this time. When I saw the opportunity to buy it at a discount, I grabbed it. Tonight I watched it again, and being my age, it inspired me again. The love the couples have for each other is tremendous and the camaraderie of the friendships is truly something that few have ever experienced. I really love that the older you get does not mean that life is gone. ""I got a hard-on"", you got one too"" God that made me laugh and think. Why should life end just because we get old? I have always believed we were not alone in this universe. As Jody Foster says in ""Contact"" ""Do you think there is life on other planets? Her dad replies ""I don't know, Sparks. But I guess I'd say if it is just us... seems like an awful waste of space."" I have always believed there are others out there. This movie only inspires that belief and nurtures the thought that they don't want to harm us in any way. They are explorers just as we are. They want to learn and you knowthere is nothing wrong with that.",Cocoon
86,Lets_talk_about_that,Much more than just another alien film,9,20 February 2005,"This is one of my all-time favorite movies, for a variety of reasons: A) It treats the theme of aging with such tenderness and doesn't reduce the older characters to props, B) It evokes questions about the supernatural/the possibility of life ""out there,"" and C) The location (Florida) looks so pleasant and inviting. I have loved this film since I was a child in the 80s, and it is still one that I watch over and over (and I still cry at the same spots every time). I have to also say that--in my opinion at least--the characteristic feature of every great movie is a great score/theme melody. Cocoon definitely has it, yet without feeling ""epic"" and overpowering; the same plucked melody chimes in quietly at all the right moments in the film, lending a profound and quiet connection with each character (even the extra-terrestrial ones). There are moments in this film where, if you don't shed a tear, there must be something wrong with you. Highly recommended film :-)",Cocoon

I was upset when I discovered the DVD was missing the whole pregnancy issue with Gwen Verdon's character, and much of the discussions between the characters about why they should or should not go with the aliens. I would have at least expected the DVD to contain the deleted scenes. I encountered this before with the movie BIG where they changed the ending after the initial release, and didn't include the alternate ending on the DVD. I would think when a DVD is released, they should at least include deleted scenes and alternate endings for the people who saw it when it first came out and enjoyed the version they saw. If they had been true to the original version I would have given it a ten, not a six.",Cocoon
