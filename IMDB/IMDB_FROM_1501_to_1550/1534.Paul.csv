0,MartinHafer,A really nice idea that is practically ruined due to an unnecessarily nasty script.,4,30 November 2011,"""Paul"" is one of the more frustrating films I've seen in a long time. While the idea of the film is quite nice and I really like Nick Frost and Simon Pegg, too often the film relies on cursing and crudeness instead of cleverness. It's like someone took the script and gave it to a couple 12 year-olds to have them 'spice it up'. It's a shame really, as I really wanted to like this a lot more than I did.The film turns out to be a reworking of the story in ""E.T""! It begins with Pegg and Frost at Comic-Con. They are both total nerds and following the convention, they are going on a cross-country trip to see Area 51 and other odd sites. Along the way, they accidentally happen up an alien...Paul. Paul is a foul-mouthed but charming alien--and the pair decide to try to help him find his way back home. Along the way, they pick up a few friends....and enemies. Can they get Paul back to his own planet? Isn't it a foregone conclusion? As I said above, the film could have been really good and there are some nice moments. I also liked how the film paid homage to sci-fi films. But, it also was often rather nasty--with an unnecessary attack on Christianity (they are semi-brain-dead knuckledraggers here) and lots of VERY crude humor--the sort that might appeal to teens--but it's a rated R movie and they shouldn't be watching this film (but they will). For adults wanting adult entertainment that is clever--keep looking. This is NOT another ""Hot Fuzz"" or ""Sean of the Dead""---it's just unrelentingly crude--like you'd find if the writer of ""The Hangover"" re-wrote ""E.T."". A MAJOR disappointment unless you like fart jokes, the incessant use of the f-word and moonings. Uggh.",Paul
1,TheLittleSongbird,Far better than expected,7,4 September 2011,"Paul is not perfect, but it is not as good as Shaun of the Dead and Hot Fuzz. However I for one found it an enjoyable movie, and much better than people I know made it out to be. I mainly wanted to see it for the concept, which seemed fun and intriguing, and for the most part it was. The story is mostly fast-paced and entertaining, but there are some predictable moments with some gags going on for too long. Also while I loved Kristen Wiig in Bridesmaids, I didn't find her character here anywhere near as well written or engaging this time round. However, Paul does look great and has an appealing soundtrack. A vast majority of the writing and gags are very funny and on target and the direction is well above average as well. Simon Pegg and Nick Frost are a well-matched pair, both are likable and their chemistry infectious, while Seth Rogan, an actor I don't really care for, is surprisingly good as Paul. Overall, far better than expected even with the flaws. 7/10 Bethany Cox",Paul
2,SnoopyStyle,Love anything from Pegg and Frost,7,2 April 2014,"Graeme Willy (Simon Pegg) and Clive Gollings (Nick Frost) are two nerdy best friends. After attending Comic-Con in San Diego, they rent an RV and drive to tour America's UFO sites. At Area 51, they run across Paul (Seth Rogen) who is an alien escaping from government detention. Ruth Buggs (Kristen Wiig) is a religious fanatic home schooled since the age of four by her father. She gets taken by the boys after Paul causes her to faint. Meanwhile the group is being pursued by Agent Zoil (Jason Bateman).I love anything with Simon Pegg and Nick Frost. This one is pretty good. Although Seth Rogen sounds very odd coming out of Paul. I keep expecting Seth to unzip Paul and come out. I also like the sweet Kristen Wiig. The comedy is a little bit mild. I expected a lot more from an inappropriate alien. Nevertheless the movie has charm and fun. I just wish for more stupidity.",Paul
3,claudio_carvalho,A Funny Entertainment for the Whole Family,7,5 February 2012,"The British nerds and aspirant comic-book writers Graeme Willy (Simon Pegg) and Clive Gollings (Nick Frost) travel to the Comic-Con in San Diego, California, to see their idol, Adam Shadowchild (Jeffrey Tambor), among other sci-fi attractions. While driving to the Area 51, Nevada, in a road trip in the UFOs land, they meet the alien Paul that asks for help to reach the Area 51. They learn that Paul was captured by the military in 1947, in Wyoming, and kept prisoner in a base in a top-secret project. Paul has contacted his spacecraft that will rescue him but now he is chased by federal agents led by Agent Zoil (Jason Bateman). When they stop in a trailer area, they abduct the religious Ruth Buggs (Kristen Wiig) that changes her religious perspective to the scientific point of view after contacting Paul and she decides to join Graeme and Clive to help the alien. But their journey to Nevada with the agents and Ruth's father chasing them is dangerous. ""Paul"" is a funny entertainment for the whole family with a humor that oscillates between the British irony and the American scatology. The lead actors Simon Pegg and Nick Frost repeat their performance of ""Shaun of the Dead"" in the role of two stupid best friends and they are hilarious. Paul is also very funny and I laughed a lot with the scene when he revives the bird. My vote is seven.Title (Brazil): ""Paul""",Paul
4,nogodnomasters,THAT'S THE STUFF THAT KILLED DYLAN!,10,26 May 2019,"Paul is an escaped alien from Area 51 or somewhere around there. He is hip, foul mouthed, and rude. Paul is picked up by two English SF nerds who are touring the US following Comic Book conventions and visiting ""UFO"" sites. Eventually they kidnap a born again woman named Ruth.In order to fully appreciate the humor some basic knowledge of Star Trek, 2001, ET, Starman, X-files, Alien, and Close Encounters is required. My first laugh out loud moment came when they stopped at a gas station. As the two Brits were heading inside, Paul sticks his head out the window of the RV, bangs the side and yells, ""Don't forget my Reese's Pieces!""A must see for any Sci-Fi fan.Foul language and sacrilegious. No nudity.",Paul
5,kosmasp,Out there,8,20 December 2011,"I have to admit, that I was surprised by the language that is being used in the movie. Then I saw the rating and it kinda made sense (R-rating in America), though I didn't expect them to go that way. But while the way is what's important, it's also what might turn people a bit off the movie, especially the first 20 minutes might seem a bit slow. Something the rest of the movie will make up for! One of the things I was sad about, was the fact I knew the ""Bird"" joke from the trailer. It would've been great to just watch it unfold on the big screen. But the movie has quite a lot of gags and it is obvious that Nick Frost and Simon Pegg get along great, even when not on a screen or a movie set. Their chemistry (combined with that of out title hero) make the movie more than watchable! Not politically correct mind you!",Paul
6,classicsoncall,"""Look man. Sometimes you just gotta roll the dice.""",7,20 October 2012,"Not being attuned to mainstream pop culture, I didn't know what to make of the DVD cover when I saw this flick at my local library. I pretty much decided it was going to be either fairly funny or outright terrible. Turns out I was laughing pretty much the whole way over the film's witty dialog and clever sci-fi movie references throughout. The Reese's Pieces bit was under the radar funny and Paul's assertion that he invented Mulder was hilarious. Paul even self references his appearance to mainstream acceptance of aliens among us as described by Whitley Strieber and depicted in films like ""E.T. the Extraterrestrial"". To give you an idea how out of touch I am with present day celebrities, I have no idea who Pegg and Frost are, and even though their chemistry together was adequate, I couldn't really relate to them as actors I'm familiar with. On that score, it was a hoot to see Jason Bateman here who I recognized even though I probably haven't seen him since some time back in the Eighties on one TV show or another. I guess I'm signaling my age by recognizing him, Blythe Danner and Sigourney Weaver and no one else. Oh yeah, Jeffrey Tambor too, only on screen for a couple of minutes but getting some good licks in of his own. To be honest though, if you're offended by colorful language and digs against Christianity, you'd probably best stay away as the assaults just keep on coming. But if you enjoy sci-fi and have a passing interest in UFO's and alien life forms, this will crack you up like no other treatment.",Paul
7,lee_eisenberg,close encounter with the funny kind,10,15 February 2013,"Not only is there intelligent life elsewhere in the universe, there's also wise-cracking life! Simon Pegg and Nick Frost play nerds attending Comic-Con who then meet a sarcastic alien (voiced by Seth Rogen). A lot of the movie pokes fun at Americans' stereotypes of the English, as well as stereotypes of Americans, and also every conspiracy theory. Probably the funniest scene is when Kristen Wiig's fundamentalist Christian tries to convince the guys of creationism, and then when she attempts to curse for the first time. But more than anything, ""Paul"" is a movie that really knows how to be funny. It's also clever how they have people appear in surprising places, and how they inserted a bunch of references to other movies. It's simply a movie that you're sure to like, assuming that you aren't the religious type. A real pleasure.Am I the only one who thought that Jane Lynch's character looks like the wife on ""Mister Ed""?",Paul
8,jboothmillard,Paul,5,20 February 2011,"When I heard about this film I was quite excited at first, then my excitement was slightly lessened by a review or two by the critics, but i wasn't going to stop me going to see it, from director Greg Mottola (Superbad). Basically Graeme Willy (Simon Pegg, also writing) and Clive Gollings (Nick Frost, also writing) are best friends, and true geeks with a love for science-fiction, and they are in America to express this passion. They start with a visit to a science-fiction convention full of memorabilia and get an autograph from writer Adam Shadowchild (Jeffrey Tambor), before moving on to continue their road trip through all the memorable science based locations, both factual and rumoured. This includes a trip through Area 51, renowned for supposed alien landings, experimentation and events, and after an accident, this is where they find an alien named Paul (Seth Rogen). For sixty years he has been hanging out in a secret military base, and having escaped he i eager to go back to his home planet, and he hops onto the two chum's RV heading for the location he will be picked up. Along the way they find out that Paul is very rude, swearing a lot, he can pass on great knowledge of everything, make himself invisible, and has healing abilities, and they end up accidentally kidnapping Christian (possibly Creationist) Ruth Buggs (Kristen Wiig) who has her beliefs shattered. Meanwhile federal agents under the orders of The Big Guy (Sigourney Weaver) are chasing after them before Paul can get back home, and Ruth's father Moses (Volcano's John Carroll Lynch) wants his daughter back no matter what. After many heart to heart scenes, funny moments and close encounters with the authoritative kind, they do make it to the place where the alien ship is going to land, and after a fight and a near death, Paul leaves Earth and returns home. Also starring Jason Bateman as Special Agent Lorenzo Zoil, Jane Lynch as Pat Stevenson, Bill Hader as Haggard, Blythe Danner as Tara Walton, Joe Lo Truglio as O'Reilly and the voice of Steven Spielberg. Pegg and Frost are almost as good as they are in Shaun of the Dead and Hot Fuzz, Rogen makes Paul a very likable character, making you laugh with his hip attitude and foul language, it may predictable quite often with sentimental mush and stuff, but it is funny most of the time, with its film buff references to alien films and programmes, like E.T., Close Encounters of the Third Kind, Star Trek and Aliens, oh and Raiders of the Lost Ark, and the road movie format is okay, a not bad science-fiction comedy. Worth watching!",Paul
9,Tweekums,Amusing sci-fi road movie,8,18 November 2012,"Graeme and Clive are a couple of English science fiction fans who, after visiting Comicon, rent an RV to tour various sites linked to UFOs. It isn't long before they have their own close encounter with an alien going by the name of Paul. He is on the run from a government facility. They agree to help him get home but with government agents on their trail they decide to hide in plain sight at an RV Park. Here the accidentally kidnap the owner's adult daughter Ruth; a fundamentalist Christian who doesn't believe in aliens even when one is standing in front of her; when he cures her blind eye her faith rapidly dissolves and she is determined to do all the things she believed were sinful; it isn't long before she is swearing like a trooper and throwing herself at Graeme. On their drive north to Wyoming they have run-ins with a couple of rednecks, agents who want Paul dead and Ruth's father. Ultimately they arrive at a site that will be familiar to most sci-fi fans where they will have to face 'The Big Guy'; a person determined that Paul won't be going home.I'd enjoyed 'Shaun of the Dead' and 'Hot Fuzz' but was unsure about this as it lacks the direction of Edgar Wright and I feared its US and cast might make it too mainstream to be as good... thankfully when I finally got around to watching it I really enjoyed it; there are plenty of laughs to be had and any sci-fi fan will be mentally ticking of various film references as they go. These references are used in such a way that it doesn't spoil the film if you don't get them; it is just an extra treat if you do and as most of them are from some of the best known sci-fi films I'm sure most viewers will get a good proportion of them. Simon Pegg and Nick Frost perform well together; it wasn't a surprise that people kept thinking their characters, Graeme and Clive, were a couple. At first I wasn't sure about Seth Rogan's performance as the voice of Paul, thinking it wasn't 'alien' but as time passed thought he did a good job and it was probably the right move to give him a normal voice. Of the supporting cast Kristen Wiig and Jason Bateman were most notable as Ruth and Agent Zoil respectively; there was an enjoyably cameo from Sigourney Weaver. While I enjoyed this I can see how some people might be offended; there is quite a lot of swearing and the way Ruth's faith was mocked and demolished may upset some people although it is clear that she was the sort of Christian who believed every word of the bible was the literal truth rather than a typical mainstream Christian.",Paul
10,paul_haakonsen,Ready to get probed?...,8,8 June 2011,"From the trailers, I had come to expect quite a lot from the movie. Actually I had thought and believed the movie to be more than it actually was when I was done watching it. Now, I am not saying that the movie is bad or dull, far from it. The movie is pretty cool and fun, though there is nothing overly new and inventive about it. And that is what sort of made the movie a bit tame.The storyline in ""Paul"" is good. An alien has crashed on Earth and now many, many years later he escapes from captivity and hits the road, where he accidentally bump into Graeme Willy and Clive Gollings. With the government in chase, Paul and his newfound friends are racing to get across USA and to get Paul home.Right, well throughout the movie there was a bunch of subtle and not so subtle references to other movies. Many of these had me laughing, because they were hilarious and quite often in your face. And it was rather surreal to have a country/hillbilly band play the cantina band music from Star Wars, but it was hilarious.As for the cast and the acting in the movie. Well, it has long been established that Simon Pegg (playing Graeme Willy) and Nick Frost (playing Clive Gollings) have amazing on-screen chemistry and they add a lot to each other. So it was nice to have another movie with them working together. Jason Bateman (playing agent Zoil; you will love his full name when it is revealed) also did a good job. He was cool and to the point, and his character was really awesome. Bill Hader (playing Haggard) and Joe Lo Truglio (playing O'Reilly) worked well together as a goofy police unit, and added some weird comedy to the movie. It was a shame that Sigourney Weaver (playing The Big Guy) had such a small role. But despite this, she always delivers a good performance. And I just loved what was said right after she got punched in the face. That was one of my favorite movie references in ""Paul"". Now, Seth Rogen (the voice of Paul) is not really one of my favorite actors, but he did a good job with the voice-acting in this movie.For a comedy, don't expect to be laughing throughout the entire movie. The movie is driven by a good story and spiced with comedy here and there. Which in itself is a good combination, and it worked well for this movie.Not to forget the CGIs in the movie. They were excellent. The character Paul was so nicely made, and the textures of his skin, face and eyes was off the charts. And those effects really helped carry the movie.""Paul"" is a great movie, though it is not Simon Pegg's and Nick Frost's best movie, it takes a lot to top ""Shaun of the Dead"". But it is a good enough attempt, and the movie works well enough all together. A movie with a great story, some laughs here and there, and it will take you out of this world.",Paul
11,tavm,Paul is an uneven spoof of various Sci-Fi classics though it still warrants a one-time-viewing,6,9 April 2011,"After a few weeks of having watched this movie, here are my comments: In attempting to spoof many various Sci-Fi classics-the works of Steven Spielberg, who cameos his voice here, in particular-there's plenty to be amused by and some moments of hilarity but the results are mainly scattershot in trying to make a cohesive whole comedy. Still, I was pretty entertained by the likes of the movie's creators in the starring roles as well as by Kristen Wiig's role as an initial religious doubter becoming more open to alien truths (at least, according to the movie's version of it). Jason Bateman also provides a role in which we don't know which side he's on until nearly the end. It's also nice to see Blythe Danner-Gwyneth Paltrow's mom-featured in another major feature. And the voice of the title character as provided by Seth Rogen provides it's own charm. There's also a surprise appearance of an actress familiar with these kinds of movies that wasn't too hard to figure out that provided some pleasures. Still, Paul is uneven in providing non-stop laughs. On that note, it's at least worth a look.",Paul
12,studioAT,Average by Pegg/Frost's standards,2,24 June 2017,"The second you see Simon Pegg and Nick Frost's names attached to this film you know what you are getting. A film very very similar to 'Hot Fuzz'/'Shaun of the Dead' etc. Only with a more sci-fi twist.And I enjoyed those films, perhaps not overly, but they were passable enough films, buoyed mostly by the warm presence of the two leads.This one is not a part of the 'Corneto Trilogy' and actually that's a good thing, because it's not to be held in the same esteem as those films.It's funny yes, charming enough, but lacking that extra oomph that turns a good film into a great one.",Paul
13,hitchcockthelegend,He's not dangerous. He's kinda rude.,8,11 August 2011,"Paul is directed by Greg Mottola and written by Simon Pegg and Nick Frost. Film sees Pegg and Frost as two British sci-fi geeks on a U.S.A. road trip to see some famous Alien landmarks. Along the way their love of all things Alien is given an unexpected boost when they gain an unusual hitchhiker: Paul, a small, foul mouthed, pot smoking Alien being. Who asks them to help him to finally get home after years of being kept prisoner by the Government. Speaking of which, the three of them best get a move on because Government law enforcers are on their tail, and was it wise to introduce a God fearing Christian into the group?Their chemistry set in stone, Pegg and Frost once again bounce off of each other with a naturalism that's hard to top in modern day cinema. However, be that as it may, questions were still being asked on if their first writing collaboration would yield the same perky, witty and charming results as their on screen performances thus far had. The answer, except for some minor lazy moments, is a resounding yes. But it's not in fact down to them. Yes they are integral to the warmth and frivolity that exists within, but they are surrounded by very well written and funny characters, characters that are acted superbly by an on form cast. Kristen Wiig, arguably the best American comedy actress in film at the moment, plays Ruth Buggs, a one eyed God fearing Creationist, full of energy and salty humour. Jason Bateman, a serious faced man in black ""official"" who delivers his dialogue like sarcasm was an art form. Bill Hader and Joe Lo Truglio as incompetent buddy buddy feds are a riot, while secondary support from Blythe Danner and John Caroll Lynch leaves a more than mirthful mark. Then there's the small mater of the film stealing Paul himself, a CG bundle of uncouth hilarity voiced by a tonally perfect Seth Rogan. With Mottola in the directing chair instead of pal number 3 Edgar Wright, Paul is undeniably more commercial than Shaun and Fuzz, with that comes an inevitability that it's also more tender. But that's fine for this is attempting to appeal to a more wider audience, and in the main it succeeds because Pegg and Frost haven't, and are never likely too, forget their roots and influences. After a less than great first quarter that sees our ""geeks"" at Comic-Con, film hits its stride once they hit the open road and encounter Paul. From then on in its buffoonery, wise cracks, cusses and friendships formed and enhanced. There's even some smart asides to religion and homophobia in the writing, while the film deftly switches from being a road-trip movie, to an all out funny, action based chase one. And even though the finale is somewhat predictable, it's unexpectedly moving and lets the film segue into a fitting closure. The only real problems exist with the now over reliance on homages and reference points to movies since past. They just about get away with it here, how could they not with Spielberg, Siggy Weaver and a host of dialogue and musical nods acting as a sort of wink wink to fans of such genre classics? For sure Pegg and Frost are still movie fans making movies for movie fans. But this charming thread is in danger of being old hat, and feels like they filled gaps in the narrative with home comforts. But hey! This is their first joint writing assignment, so some cutting of the slack is not hard to give out here. Tribute, homage and even parody, Paul is a damn fine science fiction based comedy, a film that once and for all proves that geeks actually are a bunch of fun. So to are our friends from another galaxy far far away... 8/10",Paul
14,Theo Robertson,Lacks That Little Something,5,16 September 2013,Unlike the rest of the world I wasn't too struck by SHAUN OF THE DEAD or HOT FUZZ . This follow up of sorts lampoons the sci-fi genre and its fans . It's not strictly speaking a follow up movie because it's done by a slightly different production team but this doesn't matter to the marketing men and the film concentrates on having an affectionate tongue in cheek dig at both science fiction fans and the culture clash between Britain and America . The problem is that it never really takes off I appreciated the early scenes where uber-geeks Clive and Graeme attend a science fiction convention and I did understand the points it was making . especially the point that cult authors/celebs probably have a contempt for their audience if they're not spending enough money . I'm not saying this is true of course just perhaps that's it's perceived . The story concerns itself with Clive and Graeme then picking up an extraterristial and a Christian woman while they're pursued by some men in black types . I don't know if it's just me but I wasn't entirely enthusiastically engaged by the story which lacks a little something,Paul
15,Hey_Sweden,Lots of good laughs in this riotous sci-fi comedy / road movie.,8,24 August 2012,"""Shaun of the Dead"" & ""Hot Fuzz"" co-stars Simon Pegg and Nick Frost once again prove themselves an engaging team in this lively, hilarious, foul-mouthed movie for the geek in all of us. Pegg and Frost play hardcore nerds (Pegg's an artist, Frost's a writer) who after taking in the sights & sounds of Comic Con decide to take a tour of UFO related tourist attractions in the US. At night they come across an honest-to-God alien named Paul who's escaped from Area 51 and is in a hurry to return to his home planet. Along the way they get into assorted scrapes, and are pursued by a couple of government agents (Jason Bateman, Bill Hader, and Joe Lo Truglio), the latter two seriously lacking in the brains department. While this won't be for everybody (the deeply religious won't be happy with the way they get lampooned here), ""Paul"" is otherwise truly infectious fun. This viewer can happily say that he hasn't laughed this hard at a movie in a while. The dialogue is often quotable; for one thing, Paul, who's voiced by Seth Rogen, goes on a priceless, brief rant after the subject of anal probes comes up, and for another, Pegg & Frost, who also wrote the screenplay, delightfully sprinkle in lines taken from other movies, whenever appropriate. As in ""Shaun of the Dead"", in addition to all of the humour there's a real heart to this thing, and the characters are all very likable, including Kristen Wiig as the good-hearted woman who joins Paul, Clive, and Graeme on the road. The actors play the material for everything that it's worth; the capable comedy cast also features Jane Lynch as a waitress, Jeffrey Tambor as a celebrity sci-fi author, David Koechner as a troublesome redneck, Sigourney Weaver as the dastardly villain, and Blythe Danner as the lady who as a child witnessed Paul's arrival on Earth. A voice only cameo by a certain film director adds to the fun. And the special effects are expertly done. One can completely buy Paul as a character and ignore the fact that he's a digital creation. All in all, this is solidly entertaining stuff that keeps the gags coming through the closing credits and which manages to avoid ever getting dull. Highly recommended. Eight out of 10.",Paul

17,zardoz-13,Clever Encounter of a Third Kind,8,21 March 2011,"Anybody who loves cinematic science fiction should laugh their asteroid off at ""Paul,"" an alien-on-the-lam epic. This mischievous, profane, R-rated, ensemble, road-trip comedy reteams ""Hot Fuzz"" co-stars Simon Pegg and Nick Frost. Sigourney Weaver, Jason Bateman, Jeffrey Tambor, Blythe Danner, and Kristen Wiig are also along for this occasionally surprising, often witty 104-minute odyssey. At the same time, ""Knocked Up"" comedian Seth Rogan, who collaborated with ""Paul"" director Greg Mottola on the Judd Apatow produced comedy ""Superbad,"" provides the voice for the eponymous alien who shares little in common--despite his otherworldly heritage--with director Steven Spielberg's seminal alien character in ""E.T. : The Extraterrestrial."" Whereas E.T. was a prepubescent alien, Paul is a fully mature alien who shuns shirts, spouts swear words, smokes cigarettes as well as marijuana, and has spent the last 60 years as the 'guest' of the U.S. Government. Paul resembles the stereotypical UFO alien of the Cold War 1950s, too. He is gray-skinned, possesses a bubble-shaped head with huge eyes, and looks like Gumby from the neck down. Unlike E.T.'s spaceship that landed and left him behind by accident, Paul's ship crashed in 1947 and he was grabbed by the government. Graeme Willy (Simon Pegg of ""Star Trek"") and Clive Gollings (Nick Frost of ""Pirate Radio"") are British nerds on vacation in the United States. Ostensibly, these two geeky fanboys have come to the colonies to attend the annual Comic-Con in San Diego, California. If you have no idea what Comic-Con is, this four-day event is the biggest of its kind in North America. Comic-Con showcases comic books as well as a wide array of science fiction/fantasy books and film/television shows that have become a part of popular culture in the world. Willy dreams about illustrating comics, while his closest friend Clive has written an unpublished graphic novel about a pugnacious warrior woman endowed with three breasts. Chiefly, our heroes have come to Comic-Com to meet the sci-fi/fantasy writer they idolize the most, Adam Shadowchild (Jeffrey Tambor of the ""Hellboy"" movies), but Shadowchild politely sends them packing after he gives them his autograph. This doesn't prevent our two clueless geeks from shaking hands with him. When they are at Comic Con, Graeme and Clive blend in with all the other freaks. Nobody consider them as being different. As British citizens, they qualify as 'aliens' of a sort, too. After they exit Comic Con, they become the object of ridicule because everybody suspects that they are a gay couple. Nowadays, it seems, anytime two guys are seen together exclusively, the initial impression is that they are homosexual. Graeme and Clive, however, aren't gay. Nevertheless, everybody they run into suspects that they are, and director Greg Mottola milks this joke for everything that it is worth. Our heterosexual heroes decide to rent an RV and cruise through the American Southwest, touring the hottest UFO sites, ranging from Area 51 in Nevada to Roswell, New Mexico. No sooner have they embarked on their pilgrimage than they run afoul of two crude rednecks at a UFO café and smash up their truck. Hauling butt out of Dodge so to speak, Graeme and Clive careen down a remote desert highway and worry when they spot headlights racing after them. Oh, no, Nick cringes in horror, because he fears that they are about to be sodomized by the rednecks in classic ""Deliverance"" fashion. When the vehicle that passes them isn't a pick-up truck but a black limo, Graeme and Clive feel relieved. Suddenly, the limo swerves erratically and tumbles sideways to an abrupt halt. The Brits pull up to lend a hand. Nick urinates on himself after he sees a four-foot tall alien appear with a back pack. Later, Paul explains he took the opportunity to escape because the government had gotten everything from him that he can offer. Paul refuses to let Uncle Sam perform a lobotomy on him, so he makes a break for it. Paul has a friend on the inside, but Paul's chief adversary, the Big Guy, has dispatched a conscientious henchman, Agent Zoil (Jason Bateman of ""The Switch""), to pursue the alien. Along the way, our heroes meet Ruth Buggs (Kristen Wiig of ""Whip It"") who catches a glimpse of Paul when our heroes spend the night in an RV camp. They wind up abducting Ruth to prevent her from publicizing their secret. Ruth's crazy father Moses Buggs (John Carroll Lynch of ""Gran Torno"") follows them with his Bible and a double-barrel shotgun.This amusing comedy ripples with abundant references to sci-fi sagas, among them ""Mac and Me,"" ""Close Encounters of a Third Kind,"" ""I Come In Peace,"" ""Raiders of the Lost Ark,"" ""Aliens,"" ""Back to the Future,"" ""The X-Files,"" and ""Star Trek."" Interestingly enough, scribes Simon Pegg and Nick Frost, who not only wrote ""Shaun of the Dead"" but also ""Hot Fuzz,"" penned ""Paul"" as a tribute to Steven Spielberg who phones in an audio cameo. Actually, Paul has Spielberg on speaker phone from a warehouse that resembles the one in the ""Raiders of the Lost Ark"" movies. Spielberg shares his ideas with Paul about his upcoming film ""E.T.: The Extraterrestrial."" Some material in ""Paul"" may offend hardcore fundamentalist Christians because the Kristen Wigg character is a strictly scriptural adherent who clashes with our alien protagonist when he points out that he wasn't made in the image of God. Mind you, not many fundamentalist Christians would countenance watching this blasphemous sci-fi nonsense. As funny as this alien comedy is, ""Paul"" isn't as riotous as Pegg and Frost's other films, the zombie opus ""Shaun of the Dead"" (2004) and the crime thriller ""Hot Fuzz"" (2007). Those films bristled with an indie movie sensibility. Conspicuously absent from ""Paul"" is much of the sly British cultural comedy that made ""Shaun of the Dead"" and ""Hot Fuzz"" so side-splitting. ""Paul"" amounts to more mainstream, prosaic Hollywood fare, but you will definitely lose count of all its gags and jokes before it fades out.",Paul
18,Boba_Fett1138,I'm stuck somewhere between liking it and loving it.,7,20 November 2011,"Actually I never really was all that interested in seeing ""Paul"", since it just looked like a bit of a lame and simplistic comedy to me, even though I of course really like other Nick Frost and Simon Pegg movies. I however kept hearing really good things about this movie so I decided to give it a chance, which was something I really don't regret.Let's start off by saying that ""Paul"" is a great comedy. It made me laugh from start till finish and it was being way more clever and also more subtle than its trailer made it seem.It's basically an homage to the geekdom and references a lot of fan favorite '70's and '80's movies, from often the science-fiction genre. But thing with the references are that it aren't the usual obvious ones but more the ones you'll only catch and get when you have actually seen the movie they are referencing. It's what mostly makes the movie so much fun to watch. Maybe this is also why this movie wasn't that well liked and received by just everybody. Lots of people won't get most of the inside jokes but actually I'm still convinced about it that it isn't really a must to get everything this movie is referencing in order to really like it and to laugh at its jokes as well.It's not just referencing lots of genre movies but also to its style. Really, in lots of ways this movie has Spielberg's '70's and '80's style written all over it. Funny thing is that Spielberg himself actually has a cameo in this movie as well, in which he isn't afraid to poke fun at some of his own movies.There is something with its story. I don't now, it's hard to really put my finger on it but it maybe seems to me that the script they worked with was a first draft of something that could had turned into something truly great. I feel they could had taken things a bit further. It's often being clever with its references and inside jokes but the main story itself is only just so-so. On the one hand its a lot of fun but on the other it also perhaps feels a bit underdeveloped.The movie its story also sparks some controversy by kicking against Christianity. I can see how this movie can be quite an offensive one to some people. And lets face it, was this really necessary for its story? In my opinion really not. The movie could had really easily done without it and I can even say that it sort of made the story drag at times. But again, this might be due to it that the story feels sort of underdeveloped. They could had perhaps taken it somewhere interesting or funny but it just never quite gets there.Nick Frost and Simon Pegg do a great job portraying two nerdy characters, without the glasses or silly voices. They are being the more true, more common and modern nerd, of which there are actually so many off. They represent the little nerd that is in all of us and they are so easy to identify with, for most movie lovers. The movie is filled with some other great actors as well and also has some cameo's in it from well known actors. But it's not up to a point that it becomes distracting from the movie and it's actually weaved quite nicely into the movie its story and developments.Paul himself, who got voiced by Seth Rogen, is great and realistic looking. I was actually worried because he never really looked that convincing in the trailers and I was also worried about how the interacting between him and the 'real' actors would work out. But as it turned out, everything went incredibly smoothly. Paul actually became a really great and solid character and was being just one of the 'guys', as if he wasn't being a CGI created character at all.I was really close to really loving this movie but there are still a bit too many inconsistencies and weaknesses in it to truly consider this to be a perfect movie or an absolute must-see.7/10 http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/",Paul

20,neil-476,Particularly good fun for geeks. By geeks.,9,18 February 2011,"I like Simon Pegg's work to a limited extent. Nick Frost, less so, although the two of them have an easily affable chemistry which is appealing. So I went into Paul, knowing it is about two English sci-fi geeks on a road trip visiting US UFO sites and finding themselves playing involuntary hosts to an escaped alien (the titular Paul), expecting that I would be be moderately amused.This film delivered far more than I expected.It started off at the San Diego Comicon, and I immediately identified with two Brit fanboys satisfying a wish they have had since they were kids. And then the road trip started. As well as Paul, they encounter rednecks, fundamentalist Bible-bashers, FBI agents in pursuit of Paul, and nods to pretty nearly every alien-based sci-fi movie of the last 40 years (not least of which is having Sigourney Weaver voice the Government official in charge of dealing with Paul.) I laughed quite a lot during this movie as the two inept Englishmen abroad and the beleaguered alien (excessively humanised by his many years on Earth, and extremely well voiced by Seth Rogen) do their best to escape the pursuit of the diminutive visitor.Kristen Wiig is very funny, but the biggest laugh for me came from Blythe Danner - a huge involuntary guffaw. You'll know it when it happens.Certain elements of the US cinema going-public may not care for the pasting the movie gives to those of a fundamentalist creationist bent. Personally, I loved it.",Paul

Mottola aims for a more slick atmosphere, of smooth close-ups and arc shots round Willy and Gollings with their new pal, blocking any quirky,off-beat elements entering this extra extraterrestrial tale.Spending the majority of the film with a mo-cap CGI character along for the adventure, Mottola and Sher land the best laughs by impressively keeping the appearance of Paul grounded. Mottola displays real care being shown in the realistic reflections cast across Paul's large alien eyes, which allows Paul to seamlessly blend in to the snappy comedic set-pieces,where Paul's appearance knocks everyone out in shock.Reuniting on a project they both came up with, Nick Frost and Simon Pegg continue to be in a wonderful groove as Gollings and Willy,with the hilarious ease the duo display in throwing one-liners at each other when bickering, bringing out a real, relaxed warmth to the friendship between Willy and Gollings. Toning down some of his Stoner schtick,Seth Rogen gives a breezy turn as Paul,who wise-cracking is balanced by a shaggy dog sincerity in Paul becoming pals with Gollings & Willy.While detours are taken to bring celebrity pals into the mix, the screenplay by Nick Frost and Simon Pegg fire up their joy in paying tribute to classic Sci-Fi films with a lively Road Movie adventure, which takes the mismatched pairs dead-pan mundane road trip across the galaxy,as they have a close encounter with Paul.",Paul

After unleashing all the information that he possessed, he escapes and eventually ends up with two British buddies in an RV who just left a comic convention. From there it is a road trip to get Paul to his destination before ominous agents in black take him out in drastic measure. Director Greg Mottola scored big with the hilarious Superbad and the underrated and ultra cool Adventureland. Here he is given a weaker script that is reduced to road movie clichés but Paul looks fine as the foul talking alien who speaks English and can party. Pegg and Frost had much more backing them with Shaun of the Dead and Hot Fuzz but they survive the road movie formula with their chemistry and antics as they struggle to conceal Paul. The idea that they are attending conventions provides background but the religious elements are offensive. Kristen Wiig plays the stereotypical naive Christian who is turned into a vulgar foul mouth sleaze. Paul even brings one of the characters back to life after a gun shot wound. Jason Bateman plays an agent out to bring Paul in. The role seems standard issue until the film unveils a decent plot turn. Seth Rogen provides the voice of Paul and it is an amusing steal but cannot make up for the film's shortcomings. The comic book convention background provides an interesting theme as Paul seems to fit the criteria and the satire take on science fiction films referenced throughout. Score: 6 ½ / 10",Paul

After a car crashes on the freeway, they meet Paul. Who just happens to be an alien. the pair then get embroiled with visually impaired god botherers. soiled jeans, and the big guy.....I've been waiting nearly two years for this film to be released, and even though I am slightly disappointed by the outcome, you cannot deny the genius of Pegg and Frost.It is a funny film, but the writing lets certain jokes just linger on for too long (the inventive swearing got a little tiresome after a while).But if like Pegg and Frost, you love the movies, then this is a treasure trove of nods and winks to past movies we all know and love. From the obvious (star wars) to the random ones (jaws), the references do really work, even if some are obvious for non movie 'geeks'.Rogen is annoying at first as the titular character, but he soon becomes endearing and amusing. The best thing about the whole film though is the pairing of Pegg and Frost, who you can tell are best friends in real life. they just bounce off each other, and make the film more than just a fan-boy movie, this is the kind of stuff they love, and they are sharing it with the whole world.The last fifteen minutes are surprisingly heartwarming and uplifting, even when Blythe Danner quotes Weaver with her most famous line.It's not as good as Shaun, but on a par with Fuzz, but they are different movies anyway.But it's a fun night out at the movies, with some great characters and some great jokes, just a shame that some jokes were stretched a little too far.",Paul
24,Aaron1375,Simon Peg and Nick Frost team up with an alien for a rather funny film.,8,24 August 2011,"I enjoyed this film quite a bit, it is a rare comedy that started kind of slowly, but continued to get more funny as it went on. Usually I find a lot of comedies start kind of fast then fade out kind of fast. This one has two Brits who are in the United States for comic con, the end all comic book, science fiction, horror and a whole heck of a lot more conventions. These particular two are into aliens and there to not only take in the sights and meet a favorite author, but to drive to some of the famous alien spots out in the west. Well they quickly run into some trouble with some local rednecks and then end up witnessing a very bad wreck. They go out to explore the scene and end up meeting Paul, an alien who is apparently on the run and in the need of assistance. During the course of their adventure the two Brits must keep Paul hidden from government agents and also deal with crazy religious fathers and all sorts of other things one tends to find on the road. Probably why I liked this one as I always enjoy a good traveling comedy of which this can certainly be classified as one. I also enjoy watching Simon Pegg and Nick Frost working together as they have a good chemistry. They are a couple of the few actors who I will watch a movie specifically because they are in it. I used to have a whole slew of actors and actresses like that, but these days not so much. The comedy is funny, like I said it started a bit slowly as I think the comic con scenes could have been a bit funnier, but it really got going once they met up with Paul. Not much of a Seth Rogen fan, but he did a fine job as the voice of Paul. So all in all a funny comedy that kept me entertained throughout.",Paul
25,zetes,Lousy,5,6 November 2011,"A film that should have been so much better than it was. The writers and stars, Simon Pegg and Nick Frost, came up with an absolute classic with Shaun of the Dead several years back, and their follow-up, Hot Fuzz, might not have been quite as good, but it was good enough. This is their first collaboration in a while (after several faltering attempts by Mr. Pegg to become a star in America), and it's weak. One might look to the director, since Edgar Wright, the director of those two earlier films, did not return, but Greg Mottola's previous two films, Adventureland and Superbad, were both excellent. He should have been able to handle this. Really, though, the faults are mostly in the script. Paul is about two British sci-fi geeks (Pegg and Frost) who have come to America to tour famous UFO sites. Near Area 51, they meet up with a foul-mouthed alien named Paul, voiced by Seth Rogen (I'm not a Rogen hater, by the way, and he certainly isn't what ruins this, either). The two geeks agree to help Paul return home, along with the help of Kristen Wiig and Blythe Danner, whom they pick up along the way, but they are being followed by secret agents (Jason Bateman, Bill Hader and Joe Lo Truglio). Part of the problem is the film is overstuffed. Hader and Lo Truglio's roles don't make much sense until late in the picture (although they are both pretty funny - their hide-and-seek game in particular was one of my favorite gags in the movie), and Danner appears so late in the picture and is set up so poorly that they might as well have left her on the cutting room floor (not to mention she's such a dull actress the film could have only benefited from dropping her subplot). The film is also just never as funny as it needs to be. It's not terrible, by any means, and there are a few moments and gags that work (notably Wiig's learning to swear). But most of it is a drag, which depressed this fan of Shaun of the Dead quite a bit.",Paul
26,DICK STEEL,A Nutshell Review: Paul,10,14 May 2011,"At first it was the zombie genre, then they had a hand at buddy cop films. Nick Frost and Simon Pegg are showing that they certainly are film geeks at heart with their feature films poking intelligent fun at genre movies, and carries the flag that shows the distinct gulf of class between Brit humour, and the slapstick nonsense that folks such as Jason Friedberg and Aaron Seltzer churn out with their crass products that just tried to hard. Paul is Frost and Pegg's latest attempt at subversion of the alien genre movies, It's not easy mind you, given that the majority of films that deal with alien subject matter almost always have them as the adversary in some major shoot them up action sequences, so the duo opted for a story that's predictable, yet full of charm and heart that provides that warm and fuzzy feeling, not new mind you, given that it's been done before in classics such as Cocoon and E.T. even, and I appreciate the more positive themes of friendship and camaraderie over yet another invasion type of film that we're seeing a lot these days, from Skyline to Battle: Los Angeles. Perhaps it goes to show our lack of tolerance, or total intolerance in the modern day toward those outside our sphere of familiarity, opting for, agreeing and appealing to our growing hostility, compared to a time where ""I Come In Peace"" isn't met with skepticism and a loaded, pointed gun. And why not another film about friends given that the duo effortlessly transfers their real life friendship onto the big screen and this shows.Playing English graphic novelist Clive Golings (Frost) and illustrator Graeme Willy (Pegg) who fulfill their inner fan-boy and geek-hood puberty in making that pilgrimage to Geek Nirvana in the San Diego Comic Con International (note to self: you must get there someday), they take off in an RV on a road trip along the American mid-west to pit stop at various famous alien sighting and landing spots. Why not, since you've already spent money getting abroad, to go do what your heart desires, only that their wildest dreams came true when they crash into a car driven none other by an escaping alien nicknamed Paul (voiced by Seth Rogen).So begins a madcap road trip with the friends constantly bickering over the new alien stowaway, with Clive being extremely pissy with the risks involved, and Graeme being the more accommodating, wide-eyed kid that provides for Paul to showoff his abilities, from sharing of knowledge through touch, powers of resurrection (you can almost smell what's coming with this Chekhov's GUn, although how it's introduced here is simply hilarious) and plenty of smart alecky wisecracks and inside jokes on alien films and pop references, thanks to the nature of writers Frost and Pegg who inserted multitudes of references and easter eggs that makes multiple viewings worthwhile. Take for instance when they step into a crowded bar, the tune played by a live band takes after the exact tune in Star Wars when Ben Kenobi and Luke Skywalker entered a cantina in search of a pilot.Then there's this very smart critique on science versus religious fanaticism that was brilliantly tackled here through that of the romantic fodder in Kristen Wiig as Ruth, home-schooled by her dad Moses (John Carroll Lynch) and brought up to be all God-fearing, only for the presence of Paul to cast that faith into disarray. Her transformation into the all inquisitive, potty mouth lass is something of a hoot, and becomes the token romantic figure for Graeme that provides for some tension in the friendship between Graeme and Clive, who had stuck so thick and thin that there are no less than two situations they get mistaken for more than just firm friends (though it shows, mate!) Paul is totally CG-ed and Singapore may be proud to know that we had a hand in some of the aspects in bringing the film to fruition. Seth Rogen provides the voice of the alien designed after the famous alien head pop reference, and this geek's film is shouldered by an able supporting cast that includes Jason Bateman as the all too serious, pursuing Agent Zoil, Bill Hader and Joe Lo Truglio as bumbling detectives ordered to assist in his pursuit only to develop ideas of their own, David Koechner and Jesse Plemons as two recurring rednecks and one excellent surprise cameo that lifted the film in its climax, which was frankly, a fantastic masterstroke of genius for film fans.Nick Frost and Simon Pegg may not have the services of fellow collaborator in director Edgar Wright, but as these two showed, all you need is a very solid script and excellent buddy chemistry to make a film layered, rich, and thoroughly entertaining without dumbing it down into stupidity. Paul the alien is funny yet rude, full of himself and yet possessing some of the best qualities of humanity, and yes he will linger on as one of the best alien encounters on film. Highly recommended, and may I dare say this goes into my shortlist of favourites for the year!",Paul

28,StevePulaski,Cute alien comedy ruined by one small thing...,8,25 March 2011,"Paul is one of those films that isn't as good as it could've been. Although no potential was really set because this film is very much unique, I expected more out of the jokes and the execution. I did enjoy both Shaun of the Dead and Hot Fuzz upon their release because I'm a big fan of British humor. Not to mention I like Frost/Pegg's chemistry on screen.Seth Rogen is probably the reason I was not too fond of this film. Rogen voice is very out of place as the title character. It comes off as awkward and doesn't really feel like it's in place. Not too mention, Paul's character isn't too much different from Rogen himself in movies like Observe and Report and Superbad. It's Rogen in alien form. He doesn't take on a new direction for his unique character. That's a big problem I'll discuss later on.The film is about two British comic geeks named Graeme and Clive (Pegg and Frost) who journey into American soil, and attempt to see famous American locations like Comic Con and Area 51. Graeme and Clive get an unexpected surprise when a car accident leaves a little green alien named Paul (Rogen) behind. Paul needs the boy's help big time. But he is too being hunted by a secretive government official named Lorenzo Zoil (Bateman) along with two other bumbling detectives. All three are after one little, seemingly harmless alien.The film's big problem is Seth Rogen. I've liked Rogen in Funny People, but thought he had too big of a role in Superbad (ironically, Bill Hader, a detective in this film, was Rogen's character's partner in Superbad). In this film, his voice as Paul is completely out of place. It doesn't flow right, and Paul acts too much like Rogen. It seems in pretty much every film Rogen does the same character. Thats fine if you do it well, like somebody like Topher Grace, but not when you only do an average, whatever job.This is one of the first films with Simon Pegg and Nick Frost as the leads where Edgar Wright, the director/writer of Shaun of the Dead and Hot Fuzz was not involved with. Pegg and Frost wrote the scripts to this film and did a fair job, but it almost fires like a parody movie shooting reference after reference at the audience with almost no flow. If Wright was the writer of the film he would've definitely gave the references a purpose rather than being almost consistent.Aside from Rogen's only so-so job we do get a decent supporting role from Kristen Wiig playing a Bible obsessed Christian afraid of her own shadow. I've liked Kristen Wiig in pretty much everything she's done including Adventureland to Extract. She's just an all in all great female actress.Paul's humor wasn't always the tiresome bathroom humor, but great dialog one liners and some good jokes come along. It's never boring and a comedic E.T. in a way. It succeeds in being a good comedy. Not hilarious, but well done.Starring: Simon Pegg, Nick Frost, Kristen Wiig, Jason Bateman, Bill Hader, and Seth Rogen. Directed by: Greg Mottola",Paul
29,Smells_Like_Cheese,Have a good time with Paul,6,27 May 2011,"We were blessed in the United States several years ago when we were introduced to the amazing British spoof comedy Shawn of the Dead. What a great movie! It also brought us two incredible comedic talents, Simon Pegg and Nick Frost who later brought us Hot Fuzz as well. These two work so well together because besides the fact that you can tell that they are friends off screen, they have a passion for film and have such amazing chemistry. They spoofed the zombie genre, they spoofed the action genre, now they're spoofing the sci-fi genre. Only thing that's a bit sad is that this wasn't as big a splash as I was hoping it would be. We can tell that Simon and Nick are total nerds when it comes to this stuff, it's alright because I'm a nerd as well, but they did go a little over the top on the references. Not to dismiss this comedy totally because there are some really funny moments. When I saw the trailer I think my hopes just got very high because it looked amazing, it was just a small let down when I realized that the story was either a hit or miss moment.Graeme and Clive are two English comic book nerds and best friends who have traveled to America to attend the annual Comic-Con convention. Afterwards, the two take a road trip in their RV to visit all the sites of major extraterrestrial importance. Later, they see headlights racing up behind them and they speed off in their RV. The car suddenly wrecks up right in front of them, and rolls off the highway. When Graeme and Clive investigate the crash, they meet and discover an alien named Paul who is in desperate need of their help. Lorenzo, a government agent, arrives at the site of the crashed car and informs his female superior over the radio that he's closing in on Paul, and she recommends using local law enforcement as back-up. Graeme, Clive and Paul are now on the run to get Paul home but not without taking a special friend first.Simon and Nick are still hilarious together, Seth Rogan as Paul, it does work but it's pretty much any character he's played in a movie. I'm just getting a little sick of the constant slacker role that he takes. Now with the whole religion controversy that's going on around this film, I think it's a bit silly that people are taking it so seriously. It's only 5 minutes of the film that a character questions her faith and it's a movie! One of those moments where I can say just let go and have fun, if you're a person of faith and really cannot tell the difference between a movie and real life, then you have bigger problems. The special effects on Paul are alight, I can see that they were going for the more 50's style of what we thought aliens looked like. Though in my opinion, I do wish we could come up with something a little more original, but I guess they wanted to stick with safe and familiar, so I can let that go. But like I said, the references are a bit much at times, we get that Simon and Nick both love the sci-fi genre, who doesn't? But it doesn't mean you have to reference Aliens because Sigourney Weaver is in the film, that in itself is a great reference. But I would recommend this movie for a rental, while it's nothing special, it's definitely worth the watch, you'll get a few laughs out of it. It seemed like the cast and crew had a good time, it's harmless and fun.6/10",Paul
30,lasttimeisaw,Paul,6,11 August 2011,"A film riding along the tide of the booming nerd culture, written and starred by UK bankable poker face nerdy pair Simon Pegg and Nick Frost (SHAUN OF THE DEAD 2004, HOT FUZZ 2007), directed by Greg Mottola (SUPERBAD 2007 and ADVENTURELAND 2009), plus a dedication to Mr. Spielberg's E.T.: THE EXTRA-TERRESTRIAL (1982), who proffers a self-caricature cameo as well. Chances are it could been better! Firstly I need a self-introspection to appraise my nerd index, perhaps above average, however I am quite immune to cartoons and superheroes, so Comic-Con doesn't perk me up too much, and the Simon-Nick team loses its creativity which has gained them fame and confidence, in PAUL, the a shade corny bromance is the sole vestige. But the supporting cast is really coming to the rescue, the Saturday Night Live pack dominates the scenery, Kristen Wiig is challenging Tina Fey's comedienne throne (actually after the summer sleeper hit THE BRIDESMAIDS 2011, she is on her apex now) as the foul-mouthed Catholic girl who has a father issue (a hyper- protective one), other male members contribute every bit of their energy to deliver gags; the Big Guy, a tough Sigourney Weaver is never too shabby to watch and a surprising Blythe Danner offers the most tear-jerking moment of the film; however Jason Bateman as the ill-fated double-agent, whom I consider is a tinge mis-casted here. Furthermore, Seth Rogen's voice is a pitch perfect choice for Paul, relishing the threadbare alien image and adding more spontaneous laughters. After a four-year wait, the third vehicle of Simon-Nick collaboration is a moderately disappointing comeback and its overt aim to crown itself as the E.T. for the generation is well beyond its grasp.",Paul
31,KineticSeoul,Adult comedy version of E.T. But that ain't necessarily a good thing,3,25 March 2011,"I really disliked this movie, there is just nothing funny about it. There was one lady sitting two seats from me that laughed the whole way through and I really couldn't see why, the jokes are super bland. This movie is probably made by some nerd that is into scientology, I mean some of the guy's past movies were decent. But this one plain sucked, the story is basically a adult comedy version of E.T. Except the alien this this movie has the personality of Seth Rogen which isn't surprising because you can tell right off the bat that Paul is voiced by Seth Rogen. So basically it's about 2 nerds in a RV picks up a alien Seth Rogen and goes on a road trip while some people are following them and bunch of random stuff happens. There is just tons of stuff that doesn't make any sense and it's not the sci-fi elements but a lot of other stuff. But the main flaw is that nothing is remotely funny in this movie, almost none of the audience in the theater laughed or chuckled except on lady. I know what this movie tries to do but the bonding parts aren't well done and seemed a bit forced and the character development wasn't all that interesting. Also the dialogue went from decent to bad to worse as it progressed. Through most of the movie I kept checking the time when the movie would end, and I saw couple of the audience do the same or even text and I could see why and it was understandable. This movie is most definitely a rent at best if you really want to see it, but even that isn't really worth it.3.5/10",Paul

The movie also co-stars Jason Bateman, Bill Hader, Kristen Wiig, Joe Lo Truglio, Blythe Danner and Sigourney Weaver.Pegg and Frost play two sci-fi loving British geeks who travel to America to go to Comic-Con as well as take a road trip tour of all the famous American UFO sighting locations. When a car crashes in front of their rented RV, and they go out to investigate, they meet Paul and discover he needs their help. Paul has been doing government work for the US ever since he crash landed here 60 years earlier. When he discovered they wanted to dissect him, and get what else they could from him, he made a run for it. Now he needs these two reluctant heroes to help him avoid capture and make his way to a rendezvous point with his mother ship. Along the way they enlist the help of a religious fanatic motor park owner (Wiig) while avoiding three obsessed FBI agents (Bateman, Hader and Truglio).The film isn't at all what I was expecting from it. It's kind of a serious sci-fi action film at times and it has great fondness and love for it's comedic subject material (that's what I most liked about it; the film quotes and references are perfectly timed crowd pleasers). It's best and most frequent jokes are all very subtle and aimed at sci-fi nerds that inspired the lead characters as well as the film. It doesn't make fun of these people, or the movies they love, but instead pays tribute to them, in a humorous but heartfelt way. There are plenty of dick and fart jokes as well, to keep other audience members entertained too, and like I said there's some really cool action scenes and special effect sci-fi moments also. Mottola's directing is once again top notch and Pegg and Forst's script is almost flawless. It does start out a little slow but it builds and continues to get better and better (which is the best way to pace a film in my opinion; you don't want to blow your wad in the beginning). The film has a strong classic 80's feel to it and would have made a pretty cool kids film (like the ones of that decade and I grew up on) if not for all the swearing. It's the perfect sci-fi geek movie tribute, comedy done with respect!Watch our review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j95Zjdlcbe0",Paul
33,thesar-2,Believe it: Pauly Shore's Funnier,3,13 April 2011,"Even with the worse comedy, occasionally, I'll laugh – admittedly or not – at least once, such as the wretched Vampires Suck. Though, 2011's Paul almost held the record of the first ZERO-laugh comedy I've ever seen, it still took until about the one hour, fifteen-sixteen minute mark for me to finally laugh. (Wiig's character exclaims: ""It's okay; he's alive"" and runs.) And I'll even note two more ""huh""s – as in chuckles, one immediately before the credits and one during the credits.The movie's 104 minutes long and waiting 75 minutes into a COMEDY for the only laugh, is pathetic.Marketing should take some of the blame – all the ""funny"" scenes were in the trailers. But even then, they looked only mildly amusing. In fact, the only reason I wanted to see this is because of the fantastic team of Simon Pegg and Nick Frost – both of whom are responsible to the hilarious and highly superior Shaun of the Dead and Hot Fuzz. Perhaps they're just not welcome in the USA where this was shot and takes place.Speaking of the English duo, they were horribly miscast here. EVEN though they helped write it. You knowyou don't have to star in the same vehicle you helped write.Maybe I'm being a bit harsh on the ""miscasting"" comment. Allow me to rephrase: literally anyone could've played these roles, but if I had my pick, it would've been Michael Cera and his Superbad costar Johan Hill. At least thenI would've laughed more than a dozen times. Guaranteed.So, what was it that made an all-star/all-around cast that's usually hilarious become as much of a dud as the recent performance of ""The Situation"" on Comedy Central's Donald Trump Roast?Was it the references too overwhelming that made this film almost unbearable? I can only imagine that the Pegg/Frost team are probably not that familiar with the ""American Sci-Fi"" universe and inserted the top 20 (and yeah, 20 difference references, maybe more) searches on Google. They got so tedious and an actual distraction, all I could think of was a feature length film set in a bar called ""CHEERful"" and along with the numerous Sam/Diane look alikes, you'll have a bartender named Moe, prank calls from a punk kid asking for ""Mr. I.P. Freely,"" a beagle named ""Regal"" and the only thing served on the menu are ""blue oysters.""And speaking of whichdon't get me started on the constant and mean-spirited ""fag"" jokes that certainly weren't funny at first and got progressively repugnant as the movie wore on. We get it: two best friends go on holiday together overseas and they simply must be gay, or ""fags"" as the secondary characters call them. They made it an obvious statement that they hate God, but they further pushed the line with their homophobia as well. You'd think someone that was against God would also be pro-gay. (Yes, I know they backtracked with stating Paul's planet is completely bisexual, but after that's revealed, they coast back into the gay bashing gagfor the tenth time.)Another horse they beat to death was the swearing. Ha ha ha ha, I follow the juvenile humor, and at times, in other movies that can be comical, but here, it was frankly not amusing. Kristen Wiig's character, Ruth, is released from the Holy Book and has a ""rip roaring"" time by saying ""nasty"" words at inappropriate times. Honestly, she looked almost embarrassed to say her cuss-laced lines after the fiftieth time.Two nerd BFFs, Graeme (Pegg) and Clive (Frost) make it their dream to visit both a Sci-Fi convention and then scope out the most clichéd ""alien"" spots when all of a sudden, they find a real life alien! Named Paul! Are you laughing yet? Perhaps not, so they throw those darned Sci-Fi references that would be more appropriate in a 22-minute episode of Family Guy.At any rate, they need to transport Paul, the ""anti-probing"" crude cliché, from one spot to his departure spot, à la (many, but let's just say) E.T.: The Extra Terrestrial's finale. And putting in reference/side gag Steven Spielberg in this not only wasn't funny, but now I don't feel bad about bashing his wife in my recent Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom review.All the while, they're chased by more bumbling doofuses and let the slapstick begin!Not really. But it does make this seem like a perfect family movie and virtually harmless. Well, aside from the five hundred curse words, sexual references, nude shots – okay, just from CGI-Paul and death scenes. It's almost like they did have a ""sweet-hearted"" film, but thought: That doesn't sell!I will confess in the movie's defense: it wasn't the worst I've seen. I didn't get as annoyed or p/ssed as I usually get when a movie gets progressively worse or even less funny – if that was possible in this example. (Correction: I did get thoroughly frustrated with both the completely thoughtless gay-gags and one of the biggest references: the character ""The Big Guy"" who's only heard on a radio until the finale and we're supposed to be ""surprised"" when we find out who that was. If you don't know that is from minute one, then this is, in fact, your first ""Sci-Fi"" film. And that's sad.)For the most part I just stared blankly at the screen. Not necessarily with disgust – as I do often with humorless comedies – but with boredom and a dash of sadness. Pegg/Frost probably just had an off dayif it took even that long to write this.",Paul
34,cherold,innocuous comedy,5,1 June 2012,"I expected a lot from another movie from the writers of Shaun of the Dead and Hot Fuzz, but I didn't get a lot. Paul is a very mild comedy, and by mild I mean in the half hour or so I watched of this I laughed out loud once. There are some nice touches, like Paul himself, an alien who is more Disney side-kick than eerie alien, and it has a light comedy that made me smile pleasantly, but that's about it. I didn't stop watching the movie because it was bad, but simply because life is short and there are so many movies to watch that I saw no good reason to watch this one. I was mildly curious as to what would happen, most particularly I was curious as to whether Jeffrey Tambor was going to come back and do something interesting later on, but I didn't care all that much.",Paul

36,wellthatswhatithinkanyway,Decent enough far out comedy from the Frost/Pegg staple,7,4 January 2012,"STAR RATING: ***** Saturday Night **** Friday Night *** Friday Morning ** Sunday Night * Monday Morning Graeme (Simon Pegg) and Clive (Nick Frost) are two British sci-fi nerds on a cross country trail of the States. They run into some trouble in a diner and find themselves chased for a little bit...but then run into a little green alien named Paul (voiced by Seth Rogen) and find themselves running into all sorts of capers, involving government agents, devout Christians and the spaceship coming to pick Paul up.While most modern British comedy double acts seem content to broaden their horizons on the small screen, albeit try and break America, Simon Pegg and Nick Frost have ridden on the success of Shaun of the Dead and tried to sell their talents to a stateside audience with this quirky if slightly erratic sci-fi comedy caper that, despite it's flaws, still manages to strike more hits than misses.Since it's the image they try to sell of themselves, it's fitting that here Pegg and Frost are cast as nerdy comic book enthusiasts who have an encyclopedic knowledge of a lot of films and works that have worked themselves into popular culture, and it's something they manage well. Paul himself makes a memorable entrance, and Rogen gives him a decent comic edge, whether you can give or take him.The problem with the film is it's sort of all over the place, director Gregg Mottola not establishing any firm foundation in the story and leaving the trio to amble around without a real engaging plot to cling to. This lack of cohesion does affect the enjoyment of the film, because, well, it makes your attention span wonder.Paul is more on a par with Hot Fuzz than the over rated SOTD, never laugh out loud funny, but quirky and engaging enough, with some clever nods to popular culture and self referentializing gags. ***",Paul

Together they take to the road to evade everyone from angry rednecks to government agents.If you like Simon Pegg's other comedies (Shaun of the Dead, Spaced, Hot Fuzz and the like) you'll probably enjoy the humour here, plus Seth Rogen does a good turn as the voice for the swearing, smoking alien, Paul.Some people have criticised the film for 'selling out' and being 'too commercial,' especially when compared to Shaun etc. I didn't think so. I thought it was really funny. It probably helps if you're a sci-fi fan and you can pick up on all the genre references. Also, just ignore all the debates on the internet that this film has sparked up about 'religion vs non religion' - it's not meant to really teach you anything, just be fun - which it is.Definitely one for the nerds (of which I am one!).",Paul
38,MLDinTN,the Brits meet an alien,5,27 February 2012,"Once again, British actor, Simon Pegg, is back with an off the wall comedy. He is joined by a fellow Britt. The two are in the US for the comic con in San Diego. Afterwards, they rent a RV and go on a tour of the southwest visiting UFO sites. They pick up an alien and are chased by the FBI. They also encounter a super Christain woman played by Kriten Wiig and change her mind about her beliefs with the alien. That part was very questionable as it was somewhat disrespectful. But overall, the movie has its funny moments and was some what entertaining.FINAL VERDICT: Aimed for adults. It's OK if you want to see something with this type of adult humor.",Paul
39,g-bodyl,Hilarious!,9,31 January 2013,"Simon Pegg and Nick Frost have reteamed with each other to make the absolutely hilarious sci-fi comedy, Paul. In addition to all the humor in here, I loved the fact how this movie has a heart and pays good homage to all my childhood films. If you seen the movie, you would understand all the Spielberg references here. A little bit of a warning here-if you're religious, you may not like this movie as religion is questioned here. That being said, this is really hilarious!!! This film is about two British nerds who are on a vacation to Comic-Con. When they decide to go on a road trip to visit their top-secret UFO places, they run into a foul-mouthed alien. Now they must take him back to his ship and avoid the men in black while doing so.I love when Pegg and Frost are teamed up. They were awesome in Shaun of the Dead and Hot Fuzz. This is not as good as those two, but it comes pretty close. They share just delightful chemistry. The alien, Paul and Seth Rogen are one. What I mean is that the alien is just like every other role Rogen plays. But, I liked it. I also liked Signourey Weaver being cast. She knows a few things about aliens as we all know.Overall, this is a really funny movie with good British humor and a really good creature design. It's good because the alien is simple and most alien movies these days, good or not, outdo themselves with the designs. Once again, I loved how this film referenced E.T and Close Encounters during the final few scenes. I rate this film 9/10.",Paul

This sci fi road comedy uses the alien culture collision and stereotypical to great effect by the script and likely Simon Pegg, Nick Frost, and Seth Rogan with their comedic improvisation. There is a little confusion regarding the character personality of one of the secret service agents and not the one the audience might immediately suspect. The comedy violence in a few places seems to come close to breaking the general tone of the movie. Yet it is the delicious awkward moments, the unexpected dialogue and one-liners that keep this movie a moving a pace. Overall, this predictable but fun, entertaining movie incorporates some nice references to other movies and television series, especially Star Trek and Steven Spielberg's works.",Paul
43,The-Sarkologist,This film just outright annoyed me,3,19 October 2013,"Personally I really did not like this movie. Simon Pegg and Nick Frost can make a really good duo in a comedy movie (see Hot Fuzz), but they seem to fall flat in this film. Maybe because the movie is American and American comedy just simply does not do it for me (and even though I love the Big Bang Theory, the IT Crowd is just so much better).Pegg and Frost are two English Geeks on a holiday to the US to go to Comicon. After having an experience of a life time they decide to go on a road trip to visit all of the UFO sights in the South West. However when we here the words 'road trip' in a movie we know that something bad is going to happen, and when the main characters are geeks, then that bad thing is going to involve rednecks. It does to an extent.However, on their journey, the meet Paul, an alien. However he is a very down to earth, foul mouth, dope smoking alien. Somehow that is supposed to be funny, but the concept, to me, has been done to death. Even though I have not read it, the concept sounds suspiciously like 'A Conneticuit Yankee in King Arthur's Court' though here the odd one out is the alien.The other thing that I really did not like about this movie is the treatment of Christianity. I have no issue with movies promoting evolution (since that is the current religion of choice in the developed world), but when they go out and aggressively destroy the faith of Christian characters, then that puts me off. It demonstrates that the writers simply do not understand the concept of faith, nor do they understand God.There are two Christian characters in this film, a girl who is kidnapped and then forcefully converted, and her father, who relentlessly pursues her. It is the girl that was simply unrealistic, and further, romaticising a kidnapping and what is effectively a mind rape, just simply does not do it for me. In any case, while it is not explicitly denied, there is always the possibility that Paul is a deceptive spirit. That, however, is another story and simply reading something into the film that does not exist. In any case, this film gets a big thumbs down from me.",Paul
44,paulclaassen,"Well, this was a nice surprise!",6,19 April 2020,"Well, I suppose it was inevitable for me to watch this at some point. I must be honest, when I first saw the trailer, I wasn't at all interested in seeing it, as it looked too slapstick. I was so wrong, and so glad I watched it.The characters - being a comic writer and artist - are so perfect and immediately gave us an idea what we're up against. Their set-up was very effective and believable. Yes, off course some of the scenes were rather idiotic, but then again, that's probably what they were aiming for. The majority of the humor was actually really funny.I'm generally not a comedy fan, but 'Paul' offered so much more. It was exciting and interesting, with lots of action, great visuals, fantasy, and wonderful cinematography. There's also an interesting character twist. I thoroughly enjoyed this.",Paul
45,merklekranz,"Running out of time ... running out of ideas ,,,,",7,25 July 2016,"""Paul"" has a very promising beginning, with a good laugh count. The fish out of water scenario of an alien needing assistance to get home works initially. However, just passed the midway point, after the religious zealot girl gets involved, things change from clever to redundant, bordering on boring. I mean the cursing angle is way over done, and the film seems to have run out of ideas. The last third of the film is nothing more than a cartoon-like car chase. Overall, ""Paul"" is enjoyable enough for a watch, but repeat viewings seem unlikely. It's really a shame, because the alien creature is well done, but Paul ultimately wears out his welcome. - MERK",Paul
46,tomgillespie2002,"Some laughs, but shameless Spielberg worship",5,22 February 2011,"Two British sci-fi 'geeks', Graeme Willy and Clive Gollings (played by Simon Pegg and Nick Frost respectively), have gone to America, firstly to Comic-con and then on to a road trip diverting to all UFO hot spots in an RV. Whilst in the vicinity of area 51, they are run off the road by an out-of-control car, which makes them careen onto the sand off- road. This is where they encounter Paul, a grey CGI alien escaped from said area 51, on a mission to get back to the mothership. Paul has been on Earth since 1947 when his ship crashed. Paul is a wise-ass talking, pot-smoking refugee from a distant planet who was sent here on a science project. Graeme and Clive are sequestered into taking him to find his way home. On their journey they pick up fundamentalist Christian Ruth (Kristen Wiig) from a trailer park. They are also on the run from the feds, led by Jason Bateman's Special Agent Lorenzo Zoil.And that's it really. Written by Pegg and Frost, you'd think it may have the same verve and contextual Britishness of humour as previous work Shaun of the Dead and Hot Fuzz. However, like their characters here, they have seemed to Americanise themselves so that they can one day 'make it' over the pond. It is therefore a very American affair, complete with the fitting stylised emotional 'arcs' of the characters. Don't get me wrong, there are some very funny moments in the film. Such as Paul stating that he gets his weed from the US Military, which is so strong that it killed Bob Dylan; ""But he's not dead"". Paul answers ""That's what you think"" (or something along those lines). I really liked the t-shirt worn by Ruth showing an image of Jesus shooting Darwin with the statement 'evolve this' underneath. But unfortunately many of the gags are derived from reference.This brings me to the main thing that Pegg as a writer has consistently done since the brilliant TV series Spaced. Whilst the film references in Shaun and Fuzz were at times subtle, in both Spaced and Paul, they are nothing of the sort, kicking you in the face with their obviousness. Paul might as well be an hour and a half of Pegg and Frost giving Spielberg and Lucas a big massive w**k. (Spielberg also gives a vocal cameo in the film) References to all Spielberg's Sci-fi output, along with, of course Star Wars, are so tritely signposted that it might as well hold signs up stating ""We love you Spielberg/Lucas, please suck my c**k!"" Many of the characters lines are simply lifted from 80's fodder such as Aliens (Sigorney Weaver has a cameo) and Robocop, to name just two. But most gag/references are kept for the awe of said child/directors as previously stated.The two main characters are likable, but they just seem so clichéd. They may as well be lifted (particularly Peggs character) from Spaced. And Seth Rogen voicing Paul is amusing at times, but just falls short as its just another all-too-obvious stoner character for him. Pegg and Frost chose wisely (if they chose at all) to hire Gregg Motola to direct the film, whose previous films were the actually funny Superbad and Adventureland. He brought with him the the ensemble of actors used regularly in the Apatow group, but the script is just not good enough to give the characters much to do. Perfect example being, the usually excellent Bill Hader, who in my opinion stole the show in Superbad as one-of-the-boys police Officer Slater. So it simply seems that these talents were absolutely wasted.Well, in summary, the film definitely has some genuine laughs, but just seems to leave great streams of pearl necklaces on the faces of those filmmakers who revived (or ruined) Hollywood filmmaking from 1975 onwards.

Passably funny, though one suspects even die-hard sci-fi buffs will find the film's wall-to-wall pop referencing tiring and a tad lazy. In conclusion, Paul is an entertaining film, and that is the main thing which makes it worthy of a moderate recommendation.

49,Movie_Muse_Reviews,Light-hearted homage that will be enjoyed most by sci-fi fans,7,16 September 2011,"In a world post-""Avatar"" and ""District 9,"" where lack of creativity can no longer be blamed on the limitations of special effects (if that was ever a scapegoat), the goal of the sci-fi movie has been to innovate. Filmmakers have completely abandoned the minefield of clichés that is the retro ""Area 51"" alien with a big green head and black ovular eyes. Now they're into alien design with insect-like features, especially multiple extremities. ""Paul,"" on the other hand, dives right back into the old school. Our titular little green (greenish-blue?) man not only reinforces whatever stereotypes exist, but the reason is written into his back story in the form of a lighthearted but sentimental homage to the sci-fi films of yore, particularly Steven Spielberg's two infamous entries, ""Close Encounters of the Third Kind"" and ""E.T.""But above all else, ""Paul"" is a red-blooded on-the-run comedy that rejoices (quite innocently if you can believe it) in profanity with a self-irreverence that makes it hard for any honest geek/nerd/dork to dismiss.For starters, after a prologue of sorts, the film opens at Comic-Con. Clive (Nick Frost) and Graeme (Simon Pegg) are two British buddies, one a sci-fi writer and the other an illustrator. After the convention, they aim to travel the Southwest and visit all the alleged UFO landing/spotting sites. They get exactly what they bargained for when a car wreck reveals Paul (voiced by Seth Rogen), a scrawny bug-eyed alien wearing cargo shorts and flip-flops who's on the run from some feds. After Clive pisses his pants and Graeme is assured Paul won't anally probe him, they embark on a road trip with Agent Zoil (Jason Bateman) and his cronies (Bill Hader and Joe Lo Truglio) in pursuit.Say what you will about modern R-rated comedy, but ""Paul"" is a departure for ""Superbad"" and ""Adventureland"" filmmaker Greg Mottola. Although he manages at least some of the heart of those two films, ""Paul"" is foremost an exercise in goofy. Pegg and Frost wrote the script, so the comedy with an homage to another genre makes sense, but you'd expect a bit more sophistication from Mottola. Instead, he succeeds by recognizing the difference and playing to the strengths of the film, which is magnify the silliness and embrace the unoriginality. He uses melodramatic foreshadowing to cut the scenes from pursuer to pursued to compensate for the typical plot and he lets his actors take over with their own wit to keep them vibrant despite being one-dimensional.For Pegg and Frost, this is not akin to their films with Edgar Wright. There's the homage angle, but the satire is not as biting, nor is ""Paul"" an execution of homage before comedy but the other way around. ""Paul"" packs in references to sci-fi classics, but in a way that re-evokes the bright-eyed wonder that we first associated with the honored films when they came out. Music also plays heavily into this element of the film from the band at a local bar playing John Williams' ""Cantina Band"" to other Williams/Spielberg-inspired scores.You won't have to catch all the references to like ""Paul"" and appreciate what it is. Kristen Wiig helps drastically in this way by changing up the main character dynamic and playing what could only be described as a ""born-again sinner."" But there's no ""Doubt"" that those who like ""Paul"" the most will be the science-fiction fans it caters to; it does little to try and make first contact outside its target demographic. Given the premise, no one who presses play should be surprised by that, so don't expect any sympathy from this critic should you be.~Steven CCheck out my site, moviemusereviews.com",Paul
50,lisafordeay,Funny movie that takes homage to Sci Fi movies,7,23 July 2015,"I happened to have came across this movie last night on Film 4 and I decided to check it out. The film follows two British Sci-Fi nerds who come across an alien named Paul(voiced by Seth Rogen)who is on the run and is looking for his way home(like E.T). So they help Paul out and team up with another co-pilot who happens to be blind(played by Kristen Wigg)and together they try and help Paul out as a FBI agent(played by Jason Bateman) is after him.Overall I found this film funny. The special effects on Paul is very good as it looks so real looking(as Paul is CGI). The acting was great as both Simon Pegg and Nick Frost worked on this film and have starred in numerous films before like Hot Fuzz or Shawn Of The Dead.And the rest of it was funny too.

51,Turfseer,Brits misfire with boorish 'ET' characterization,3,14 August 2011,"Two sci-fi nerds also obsessed with extraterrestrials, crossing paths with a real-life ""ET"", seems like a clever enough premise for a new science fiction comedy. Unfortunately, the new concoction, ""Paul"", is completely predictable and features few laughs. This time the bumbling protagonists, Graeme Willy and Clive Gollings, are from Britain and after attending the annual ""Comic-con convention"" in San Diego, drive down in their RV to visit all the extraterrestrial sites of critical importance, including the most famous 'ET' site of them all, Roswell, New Mexico. In that vicinity, they run into Paul, a foul-mouthed extraterrestrial, who has a similar appearance to the aliens purportedly seen or captured in Roswell. Paul has been on the run from a shady government agent by the name of Lorenzo Zoil, who answers to a mysterious female superior who doesn't appear until the end of the film. Zoil also conscripts two bumbling FBI agents who have no clue as to Zoil's mission.The main problem with the film is that the 'Paul' character is unpleasant and unlikeable. Instead of the a gentle Spielberg 'ET', Paul is depicted as being crass and the film's scenarists (Pegg and Frost who play the lead characters) think that's funny. There's a scene that's symptomatic of the whole problem with 'Paul'. While driving in the RV, a bird is killed and Paul brings it back to life with his special powers. Graeme and Clive are overjoyed that Paul has been able to resurrect the bird but are suddenly horrified when Paul stuffs the bird down his throat for a tasty meal.There are other distasteful moments in 'Paul' including the elimination of the FBI agents as well as Zoil's superior (played by Sigourney Weaver), crushed by Paul's alien aircraft, which has come to back to earth to save him. In a lightweight comedy such as this, having characters killed off (especially since they're only ineffectual buffoons), spoils the light hearted tone of the plot.Speaking of the plot, there's little to mention here. Paul manages to convert a foul-mouthed Christian Fundamentalist (Ruth) into a mensch by first curing her of blindness in one of her eyes which she's been afflicted since childhood as well as sharing his knowledge of the universe via a kind of mind meld. Paul also seeks out the woman who saved his life when his spacecraft crashed back in 1947. Despite the fact that Paul killed the woman's dog when the spacecraft crashed, she seems genuinely glad to see him, as his presence vindicates her life-long claims that indeed she saw an alien when she was a child. Both Ruth and Tara are such ditsy, over-the-top characters, that one can hardly take either one of them seriously.'Paul' ends with a scene reminiscent of 'Close Encounters', with an alien ship coming to rescue a now more 'sensitive' Paul (his decision to revive Graeme after he's accidentally shot to death by Ruth's father) seems to invigorate his cynical soul. Zoil reveals that he's actually been trying to help Paul, Tara joins Paul in the spacecraft and the Brits end up at the next comic book convention with a new book based on their misadventures with the newly self-actualized extraterrestrial.Alone, the bumbling Brits truly have little to add in terms of 'on the road' comedy adventures. Their decision to depict Paul in their own image (boorish and crude), undermine the film's potential, which could have ended up more in league with Spielberg's charming take on extraterrestrial machinations.",Paul

But as I like British comedies and have seen some great films with Simon Pegg's participation, I decided to dedicate 1,5 hours of my life to Paul. Although the plot is hectic, not evenly running and some humour is banal, the overall picture is good, I had my giggles and joy of recognition. As for other actors, I found supporting performances even more fascinating: Jason Bateman as Special Agent Lorenzo Zoil, Kristen Wiig as Ruth Buggs, Sigourney Weaver as ""The Big Guy""; I am not so much into Nick Frost and Seth Rogen, I consider them as clown-like comedians. Still, I have to admit, that Paul's appearance and lines were funny.I am sure you will find the film good if you like comedies and have some knowledge about last-century science fiction films. And thanks to Brits there is witty scoffing at religious and conservative values.",Paul

54,freemantle_uk,Its probing time,8,17 March 2011,"Simon Pegg and Nick Frost certainly have a great working relationship since their days on Spaced. It translated into a success film career and now they have attempted their biggest project and without long-time director Edgar Wright. Greg Mottola (Superbad) steps in and tackles this sci-fi comedy with a lot of success.Graeme (Pegg) and Clive (Frost) are two British sci-fi geeks visiting America, starting with Comic Con. They travel the Southwest to all the famous UFO sites where on the road they encounter a real-life alien, Paul (voiced by Seth Rogen). Graeme, Clive and Paul quickly have to go on the run from government agents (Jason Bateman, Bill Hader and Gregg Turkington) as they help Paul, but end up kidnapping a fundamentalist Christian, Ruth (Kristen Wiig), on the way.Paul is not as good as Shaun of the Dead or Hot Fuzz, but it is a film that Pegg and Frost fans will enjoy. There are plenty of laugh-out-loud moments with really funny plays on convention (my personal favourite involves probing), but there are also cruder moments that Pegg and Frost have avoided in the past. This is, of course, a move to cater to Seth Rogen's style of comedy. Added to the mix is Bateman's deadpan style working against his numb-skull colleagues. The mix of styles works well for the most part and there are some good running gags, but some do not work as well.Wright's directing style is very quick and kinetic in Hot Fuzz and ""Shaun,"" but Mottola has a more relaxed style; he wanted Paul to unfold gradually. He is able to keep boredom from setting in, but he is working with a more rudimentary script.The chemistry between Pegg and Frost was never in doubt and Frost's character was made out to be smarter than he has been in previous films. They geeky pair play against Rogen's outrageous character who is intelligent but basically a frat boy. Wiig's role of a fundamentalist Christian turning into an atheist will possibly upset organisations like the Christian Science Monitor, but for me that is more an endorsement that shows some of the dogmatic views of creationists. Her discovery of swearing, however, does get tiring.The CGI for Paul was really effective, showing how a grey alien could really look. There was excellent little details in his face and the way he shows expressions. it's the kind of special effects that enhances a film.",Paul
55,Polaris_DiB,Them aliens sure can make an 'Merican genre film,7,16 April 2011,"Whereas the holy comedic trinity of Wright, Pegg, and Frost can be depended on for epicly entertaining epic entertainment, individually I find them to be pretty dependable on their own. It seems like the three had to split up over scheduling issues while Wright was busy making the best film of 2010 (that would be Scott Pilgrim vs. the World, in my humble opinion), Pegg did the hilarious Burke & Hare. Nick Frost was great in The Boat that Rocked (aka Pirate Radio, aka Good Morning England, aka whatever), and so all in all I've decided that these three guys are worth following. Pegg, in fact, has already proved to me capable of turning a tepid movie (Run Fatboy Run) into quite the endearing romcom.Anyway, to Paul. Pegg and Frost are two English sci-fi nerds who go on an extraterrestrial site tour of the United States only to meet an extraterrestrial, turning their slacker and directionless lifestyle road trip into a slacker and directionless run from the law. It helps that the ET they meet is a snarky, foul-mouthed, smoking dude voiced by Seth Rogan, by which I mean Paul might as well have been named Seth.What makes this movie is two things: One, the references and take-offs of various science fiction movies is actually built logically into the plot, as Paul explains that the greater bulk of popular culture extraterrestrial iconography is either inspired by or outright dictated by him. For some reason, that one detail really helps this movie make a whole lot of sense. It doesn't mean that all references necessarily fit... Lorenzo's Oil? Or that they fit comfortably... Sigourney Weaver's cameo was pretty forced. But once again, it's a movie made for fans of movies, so at least bothering to add that justification was a smooth and welcome move.Two, Simon Pegg in particular and to a degree Nick Frost seem really dedicated to making their characters really care, to help the audience care about them. The greater problem with modern day slacker and mook comedy is simply that oftentimes the characters really are not much more than clowns without face paint, usually lacking many interesting characters besides the fact that they're dumb enough to get themselves into whichever situation the movie contrives. Here, this is not the case. Between all cuss words and anal probing jokes are people who seem to really care for each other, and make wonderful connections and friendships as they go along. This is especially well done in the character of Paul himself, who basically needs help but really does not want to endanger anybody or step on any toes.That said, I actually think Pegg's and Frost's roles should have been reversed, mostly because they felt too aligned with the general character people are starting to recognize them for, when I know for a fact that they are both capable of mixing it up a bit. When I was watching this movie, I couldn't help feeling like the two wrote the script with the other person in mind, so that actually Pegg's role fits Frost better and Frost's role fits Pegg. Maybe I'm wrong on this, but I think it would have made a much more interesting dynamic, like how Robert Redford and Paul Newman switched roles in Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid to avoid playing to type.There are a few other nitpicks I have but I don't care enough about them to have them affect my enjoyment of this movie. The most important thing is that when I was watching it, I was not writing this review in my head or so involved in reference-matching to notice I was watching it. It lives up to its promise of being entertaining and endearing, and that is all I went into it for.Off-hand, intellectually I find it really cool that a couple of Brits got to make an American road movie together. You can tell they REALLY enjoyed it. The road movie is a genre sort of peculiar to the United States because of its land mass and cultural affiliation of expansionism and the ""freedom"" of open spaces, and whereas road trip movies do exist in various forms around the world, this one is obviously embracing the particularly American brand of the genre.--PolarisDiB",Paul
56,strong-122-478885,An Alien Encounter Of The Flatulent Kind... P.U.!,3,15 June 2014,"If Paul (in-between all of his incessant farting, saying ""F__k!"", smoking cigarettes, hurling insults and, in general, being a rude, little alien-bastard) had even once shared one worthwhile insight with us or told us a super-fantastic tale of life on his own home-planet, then, yes, I would've surely rated this hopelessly lame, one-note-joke, Sci-Fi/Comedy somewhat higher.But as an alien with a mighty mean mouth who has whole-heartedly embraced everything trite and despicable about today's pop culture (and who even made a point of encouraging a child to steal), Paul's predictable, little ""bad-boy"" schtick unfortunately wore out its welcome at about warp speed.I found the Paul character to be about on par with that of an obnoxious and belligerent 14 year old boy. In other words, Paul was pretty much a contemptible piece of ""you-know-what"". And it didn't help matters much that it was Seth Rogen who provided the voice of Paul. Rogen's voice was clearly all wrong for this particular character.If, in real-life, you were to actually meet an alien from another world, would the likes of Paul be your first choice? Would meeting Paul be your dream-come-true as far as a close encounter goes? Well, to be totally honest, meeting Paul wouldn't be my first choice (nor even my 5th choice) for an alien encounter. No way, Jose! I would hope that an alien-being would be able to teach me something really, really worthwhile - Something so utterly amazing. Something that I've never, ever heard of before. Instead of, like Paul, continually spewing out the vilest pile of poop straight out of a ""pop culture"" lexicon that I've heard about a zillion times before, ad nauseum.Ugh!..... No thanks!...... Like, E.T. go home and stay there! To me, Paul was a completely throw-away character.",Paul
57,dee.reid,"I liked ""Paul""!",8,10 August 2011,"""Paul,"" directed by ""Superbad"" Greg Motolla, is a great movie! I missed it at the theaters earlier this year, even though it starred (and was written by) ""Shaun of the Dead"" and ""Hot Fuzz"" stars/co-writers Simon Pegg and Nick Frost. ""Paul"" is their latest collaboration of bringing British-style humor to us tasteless Americans. ""Paul"" begins in 1947 (note the year, which is the same as the famous Roswell, New Mexico, alien-crash-landing controversy), when an alien spacecraft crash-lands in Wyoming, right on top of some poor little girl's beloved Golden Retriever Paul.64 years later, British sci-fi nerds Graeme Willy (Pegg) and Clive Gollings (Frost) are on a tour of the American Southwest, the heartland of (alleged) UFO activity in the country. In their travels in a fully-loaded RV, that's when they come across a genuine Little Green Man from another planet, the smart-ass alien ""Paul"" (voiced by Seth Rogen, continuing his likable slacker shtick in CGI form), the same extraterrestrial who crash-landed back in Wyoming back in 1947 and has been named after the dog he accidentally crushed to death.It turns out that when Paul first arrived here, he was detained by the military and was able to provide all of his knowledge to the government and subsequently influence more than half a century of pop culture (Mr. Spielberg, you devil, you!). Paul has unfortunately outlived his usefulness and the scientists who detained him are eager to learn more about his abilities. This would unfortunately include the dissection of his brain, and is also the reason why he is now a fugitive on the run from the government, and is on his way to a rendezvous with the mother-ship from his home planet in - you guessed it - Devil's Tower in Wyoming (the famous location of the human-extraterrestrial rendezvous in 1977's ""Close Encounters of the Third Kind"").But Paul is no ordinary extraterrestrial. He proves to be quite intelligent, but has obviously picked up a few bad habits by giving into American slacker culture over the course of his 64-year detainment. He has an extremely limited vocabulary, has a fondness for pot and booze, but is still incredibly likable and even sympathetic, like some of the best and most memorable movie aliens. In fact, Rogen's portrayal of Paul could in some way be considered a deconstruction of, or even a parody of, movie aliens (like the ones made famous by Mr. Spielberg in ""Close Encounters"" and ""E.T., the Extraterrestrial"").And even though Sigourney Weaver pops up here in a thankless villain role as a high-ranking government agent known only as ""The Big Guy"" (it should really be ""The Big Gal,"" but I digress) she does in fact get some of the movie's best and funniest lines and is in fact quite a funny actress in her own right; I knew that anyway, since she is my favorite actress, after all, in a role that's a complete 180 from my favorite movie of hers, ""Aliens"" (1986), which also gets skewered here. And Jason Bateman, Bill Hader, and Joe Lo Truglio turn in hilarious (and self-knowing) performances as bumbling government agents hot on Paul's trail.""Paul"" is a great adventure-comedy/road movie with a sci-fi twist. The acting from Simon Pegg and Nick Frost is brilliant, as they both were previously in the aforementioned ""Shaun of the Dead"" and ""Hot Fuzz."" Now here is where things get personal for this reviewer. In regards to some of the unnecessary controversy directed at this movie, some viewers have also expressed concern with the character of Ruth (Kristen Wiig), a Bible-thumping fundamentalist Christian woman whose faith is shaken by her time with Paul. It's a comedy, folks, and this is coming from someone with a Christian background, but is now more spiritual and philosophical than overtly religious.That does not mean, however, that I do not believe in the existence of God, or a ""god."" That also does not mean that I do not believe in the existence of extraterrestrial life. In fact, I personally find it offensive and a slight to God to NOT believe in the existence of other forms of intelligent life in the universe besides us measly humans; the universe is constantly expanding, new planets and galaxies are being discovered everyday, and there's just no way to believe anymore with a straight face that we are the pinnacle of God's masterwork. In fact, it could be argued that there's proof within ""The Holy Bible"" itself of mankind's past encounters with extraterrestrials; read the first and tenth chapters of ""The Book of Ezekiel"" for further reference.But, whatever; this is all just my honest, humble opinion. If you find ""Paul"" offensive, then just don't watch the movie, and that's all it is: a movie, a movie about a smart-talking, pot-smoking, slacker alien named ""Paul.""8/10",Paul
58,meeza,Sci-fi high alien is of the funny kind! Even though it resides in Silly Planet!,8,30 March 2011,"""Paul"" is a bizarre comedy that is really a two-hour homage fest of the great sci-fi pictures and TV shows of the last 40 years, which include ""Close Encounters of the Third Kind"", ""E.T."", ""Aliens"", ""The X Files"", ""Star Trek"" (did I just say that ""Star Trek"" is great, not a Trekkie), and a cluster of more; I cannot think of any more at the moment, I guess I am spaced out. ""Paul"" stars the British comic duo of Simon Pegg and Nick Frost as respectively (or maybe not after you get hold of these character names) Graeme Willy and Clive Gollings. Graeme and Clive are a couple of man-boys who delve into Comic Book Geekapolooza when they visit a San Diego Comic Book Conference. After the conference, they visit the fable ""alien-finding"" historic site Area 51, and guess what they encounter! An Alien! Wow! OK, sorry that my sarcasm is alienating you from this review. I will not stop, I mean stop. Anyways, the alien is a pot-smoking, obnoxious, ""out of this universal area code"" non-earthling called Paul. He looks just like the aliens we have seen and loved (in the movies that is) and there is a purpose to that which Paul explains to his new shell-shocked British ""road tripping America"" friends Graeme and Clive. Paul is just another ""alien on the run"" who has been held captive for the last few decades after crashing into a farmland years ago, due to his Alien Airlines (I mean spaceship) which had a mishap that caused it to crash. Paul escapes his captives and all he wants to do is pull an ""E.T. Text Home"" and return back to his planet with his alien peeps. A willing Graeme and a dubious Clive eventually decide to help Paul to have a close encounter with his kind by taking him to where he has a chance to leave Planet Earth and meet up with his brothers from the same planet mother. The problem is that Paul is being chased by a persistent FBI agent called Zoil (Jason Bateman), and a couple of clownish FBI amateur agents called Haggard (Bill Hader) and O' Reilly (Joe Lo Truglio). Let's just say that the latter two are not much of a Haggard hazard and a O'Reilly factor in trying to capture Paul. Or maybe they are? Wont spill the beans, don't want to be an alien Zoiler I mean spoiler? Now there is a ""Big Guy"" that is giving the orders to Zoil, and the Big Guy ends up being a big surprise. However, I will zip the big mouth and let you see for yourself who is the Big Guy! Anyways, the British lads and Paul hit the road and make a pit stop at a trailer rental community. There is where Ruth Buggs (Kristen Wiig) gets into picture. Ruth's father Moses Buggs (John Carroll Lynch) commands the trailer rental community and is a tenfold religious zealot. Ruth falls for Graeme's willy, I mean Graeme Willy; and after a wild scenario, Graeme and Clive's trailer is bugged with Ms. Buggs' presence. Ruth eventually sees her eyes (I mean eye, you have to see the movie to know what ""eye"" am referring to) on Paul and after a faint or two actually ends up transforming herself from a raised religious believer to a heavy-cursing free spirit; of course, with a little help from her newfound alien friend. The rest of the flick ""Paul"" is a cat and mouse of the FBI's and also Moses Buggs' quest in trying to capture the elusive Paul. Director Greg Mottola, who also helmed ""Superbad"" and ""Adventureland"", does not really bring much into the orchestration of ""Paul"" than his evident passion of honoring his favorite sci-fi flicks; I mean I love those movies (except ""Star Trek"") too but his love for them was a bit too far out for my taste. Frost and Pegg actually pegged this one down on paper by scribing the movie's screenplay. Speaking of paper, this character Paul and the movie's delirious narrative should not work on paper, it's too flimsy for it to work. But call it an unexplained ""out of this world"" phenomenon, but ""Paul"" actually works. I did laugh several times at Paul's obnoxious and slacker ways, and I could not believe I liked this movie. Yes, I was in the cinematic ""guilty pleasure"" planet. There is nothing earth-shattering about Seth Rogen's voice as Paul, or in the rest of the acting of ""Paul"", but somehow it worked. It looked that the Mottola regulars' comedic acting troupe were having a blast in ""Paul"" and just having a go with it; so it did not require for them to be master thespians in playing their over-the-top characters. ""Paul"" is not for all, but I think you should still have a close encounter with it. **** Good",Paul
59,CubsandCulture,Intergalactic Road Trip,10,22 July 2019,"I think I am in an extreme minority on this but this is my favorite Pegg/Frost film. It might be the road trip thing but I simply love this tale. It is funny, poignant and refreshingly in tune with what it wants to do. It is very much a sci-fi film for sci-fi nerds. The humor is very character driven and while it has the standard blue comedy of these sort of films it never goes too far. Every joke lands.The best parts of the film are Paul and Ruth's story. Paul is a wonderfully realized character at both the CGI level and the writing level. He is utterly believable at all times and I am shocked that this film didn't get more attention for its special effects. As a character he turns a lot of the tropes dealing with aliens inside out. He is such a bro and the explanation for why he is so in-tune with pop culture is really clever. Ruth's story is one of the few I can think of where a person losing their faith is a good thing. The film is a little too pat with how that happens but it is so refreshing to see this character arch in a in cinema.The area 51 memes made me remember to re-watch this film.

61,barnabyrudge,"Sci-fi spoof, very funny in patches but not sufficiently polished as a whole.",6,28 June 2011,"Simon Pegg and Nick Frost have already spoofed the zombie genre (Shaun Of The Dead) and the action genre (Hot Fuzz), and here they spoof the sci-fi genre with the epically silly ""Paul"". Parts of this film are pure comedy gold, easily as funny if not funnier than anything the Pegg-Frost duo have done to date. But the key word in that statement is ""parts"" ""Paul"" also has more longueurs that any of the other films the duo have made, and therein lie its flaws. Watch the funny bits only and this could be classed as Pegg & Frost's best film; watch the whole film and you'll probably come away considering it their weakest entry to date.British nerds Graeme and Clive (Simon Pegg and Nick Frost, respectively) are travelling around America visiting sci-fi conventions and major UFO sites. One evening they witness a car crash, but when they pull over to help they discover the car is being driven by an alien on the run from a secret base. The alien introduces himself as Paul (voice of Seth Rogan) and asks the pair to help him escape. Initially reluctant, Graeme and Clive soon find themselves assisting Paul as he flees from the government agents on his trail. Their journey takes them across America, where they pick up a travelling companion in bible-bashing trailer park girl Ruth Buggs (Kristen Wiig). But enemy agents are hot on their heels every step of the way, especially Agent Zoil (Jason Bateman) who receives his orders from a shady authority figure known simply as the Big Guy (Sigourney Weaver). Everything is resolved at Devil's Tower, Wyoming, where Paul has arranged to be picked up by a flying saucer from his home planet if he can stay alive long enough to make the rendezvous! There are so many in-jokes and cross-references to other sci-fi movies that you may need to rewatch ""Paul"" several times to get them all. The movie is certainly a sci-fi geek's wet dream. The performances are generally good, although none of the actors are particularly stretched – they could all do these kind of roles in their sleep. One surprise is that Weaver is rather disappointing in her cameo role as the head bad-guy. Most of the role is an off-screen, voice-only guest spot, but she belatedly turns up in person near the end and seems horribly wooden (as if her heart really isn't in it). The special effects are actually pretty good throughout, with Paul himself looking convincing for a CGI creation. The comedy is mainly of the vulgar type, with a surprisingly high quota of foul language and bad-taste jokes about bodily functions. It's funny enough if you're in the right frame of mind, and as mentioned a few of the gags are genuine side-splitters, but at the same time there's a slightly lazy air about some of the writing. It's been 14 years since Men In Black, yet some of the same old alien conspiracy theory jokes are still being recycled here. ""Paul"" is a laugh, no question, and it's all very enthusiastically presented. It just needed a bit more polishing around the edges.",Paul

Here he's again teamed with his partner in crime Nick Frost with Seth Rogan as the voice of Paul the alien. It's a road trip movie that sees sci-fi geeks Graeme and Clive picking up an extraterrestrial hitchhiker named Paul and then helping him get back to his mother ship while the FBI closes in on them.Paul is cute and funny in a dumb sort of way and works especially well if you're a science fiction movie nerd (like me). I appreciated all the homage paid to movies like 'ET', 'Star Wars' (cantina song) 'Close Encounters of the Third Kind', 'Alien' etc. Even with all that going for it though, this still wasn't as good as I was expecting and ultimately didn't quite hit the mark for me. 09.11",Paul

""Paul"" arrives and delivers a solid punch, with a story that many would never call original, but it is fearlessly executed, and it has a heart of gold. Whereas some of the expletive in ""The King's Speech"" were a little ""too cute"" and unnecessary, every single one of the ""spicy"" words can only add more zing and dimension to the already clever dialog that is the driving force of this very funny tribute to Science Fiction.I read somewhere there were 382 or so references to other movies in here, and I must have to head back to the movies to catch them because there were indeed several, and they are tributes, slight references, funny highlights, and seamlessly woven into the fabric of the film. A movie that tells the story of an extraterrestrial who must find his way back to his home planet or face death.""Paul"" hasn't quite been a central character in any movie before. This foul-mouthed, funny, and sympathetic creature teams up with a couple of British nerds who have finally made it to their dream vacation/location. Soon, they are being chased by rednecks, religious fanatics, and a few men in black, who happened to be soldiers in an army led by the ultimate ""female boss"". Has anyone noticed a few references already to some very popular blockbusters? Some of my favorite scenes involve direct and indirect references to ""E.T."", ""Duel"", and ""Star Wars"", and anyone might think them cheesy and outdated. Most are actually heartfelt and show much affection for the classics in a genre that is often under-appreciated. Mel Brooks would have made light fun of them, but the film feels more accomplished and way more entertaining this way. We know it's fantasy, and it is not new, but we can see a fresh touch up has been added. Just imagine improving on the sense of wonder while looking at the Mothership near the end.Prepare yourself to deal with silly lines, bawdy language, hilarious scenes vaguely resembling a comedy of errors, and an amazing and incredible take on the Cantina Scene in the original ""Star Wars"". Much praise should go to the cast who did a very good job bringing to life characters that could have been boring and trite. They all gave them solid dimensions and never forgot that behind every alien film that succeeded has been a sense of heart and honesty and a touch of faith to help us believe in its message.***** (5 out of 5) - an instant classic.",Paul

Shaun of the Dead, Hot Fuzz, The World's End are each tremendous and really made me think that putting Pegg and Frost together was a recipe for instant success. Then there was Paul. Obviously, there's a different team at work here but I still had hope...What holds true is that Frost and Pegg have remarkable rapport together. They work so well and really can pull of the nerdy blunders in a way a lot of guys can't. My issue is most everything else. Bateman, Lynch, Weaver, Hader, Truglio and Wiig are all solid here but their characters never quite hit that sweet spot because the tone of this is just off to me. Stoner Comedy with aliens just doesn't hit the mark for me throughout. It all coalesces in Rogen. To be clear, I don't think it's his fault but Rogen's voice is too iconic at this point, it's too distinctly his, so when we put him as the voice of Paul, it never quite works for me, especially when you add his Rogen-isms and the stoner humor.I don't mean to bag on this too much though, it's a fun movie, it's just not stacking up to the other, better works out there. Still, Frost and Peg are always worth watching and this ensemble cast has some genuinely entertaining moments, it just fails to all come together in a complete package for me. It's worth checking out if you can stream it somewhere, probably not worth paying for, not for most people.",Paul

( and believe me they are not that amusing). This has all the hallmarks of a kids movie but with the swearing hence it really struggles and becomes difficult to watch but the worst thing about this film is that its just so boring and that about the worst thing a film can be accused of.Pegg and Frost need to think long and hard with their next project and they definitely must base it in the UK because playing the nerdy Brit in the US had been done to death so many times before.Paul is not so much out of this world but more like out of ideas,",Paul

Its merger of crude/rude and witty comedy plus a cast where everyone brings their A-game, without going too far makes Paul a good watch.Let's start with top billing. I'll be among the few to say that I didn't love either Nick Frost or Simon Pegg in the Hot Fuzz/Shawn of the Dead duo. They wrote themselves with too much 'sour' in mind and too much self-mockery. For this script, I think they nailed it. Here they are not simply goofs, they are likable goofs, the parts have been written with a few more 'straight' moments, and honesty to balance the satire. The two of them are on an RV road trip in the south western states from Comic-Con to Roswell. Once in New Mexico however, they get perhaps a little more than they anticipated when they meet the survivor of a car crash in the middle of the night...a little green man, one who speaks English, has been on Earth since 1947, and is asking for a lift.Paul is delightfully beyond the reach of reason. It's actually a million light years more absurd than Shawn of the dead and Hot Fuzz, so I felt a little more explanation would've helped. It's not too hard to draw conclusions about how Paul learnt English, but why is he speaking it like a punk? He has some really great lines, but he seems way too human for an Alien. Then again, if he wasn't the movie wouldn't be quite as funny.As the movie starts to wrap up, it does so with a lot of spectacle (perhaps maybe a bit too much). A few too many guns get pointed bullets get fired for me, but at least the laughs keep coming which is important.Paul, creaks a little here and there, but it is appetizing as a comedy with a buddy movie spirit and a good dose of sci-fi satire.",Paul

Surprisingly enough, Paul is the joke that becomes least tiring throughout this film. He isn't always trying to be offensive, and actually brings a little heart and soul to the piece. I found there to be a lot of unnecessary Christian bashing going on throughout. As it was done without the slightest hint of satire, and in the movie God is disproved by the existence of a fictitious alien, it seemed a poor argument. Otherwise it's quite fun. It never had me laughing out loud, but I was mildly amused. Unfortunately, towards the end it is nothing but quotes from greater film. I mean the entire last 20 minutes seemed comprised of quotes delivered in all seriousness by the cast. Will aid a nice drinking game for cinephiles, but was tiresome while sober.",Paul
69,Seraphion,I really enjoyed this hilarious movie,7,23 September 2014,"The story opens up very mysteriously, kind of signature of any old time alien movie, then it snapped it the supposedly squashed dog. The movie then slowly build on the 'nerdiness' of the main characters pair, and their brush-ups with all the side conflicts up until the main conflict arrives. The entire movie feels like an old school classic non-horror alien first encounter movie such as Mac and Me and E.T, which are directly or indirectly mentioned, mixed with the usual crazy stuff by the Simon Pegg and Nick Frost pair. But this time, with all the American air around, I feel that the jokes and humor are more familiar to the wider audience. Also they feel more enjoyably laughable. The addition of thriller parts and action-felt car chases is not uncommon for the Pegg- Frost works, but in this movie they feel more gripping. Aside from the comedic pair of Simon Pegg and Nick Frost, which has kind of found their own private chemistry and made all their collaborations enjoyably funny, Kristen Wiig and Jason Bateman's performance looked very nice. They can make the serious parts feel quite heavy, even amid all the funny scenes.",Paul
70,RainDogJr,"it's evolution, baby!",10,14 August 2011,"British director Edgar Wright went to North America, cast Michael Cera, and the result was a darn masterpiece (the very best movie of 2010 for my money). With PAUL it was time for Wright's favorite pair of actors, Simon Pegg and Nick Frost, to go to America together, as the team they are. They landed in the best possible hands: SUPERBAD's director Gregg Mottola. And you can't do wrong when you put together the British ""Blood and Ice Cream Trilogy"" (aka ""Three Flavours Cornetto Trilogy"") team and the American Apatow team. You just can't do wrong. This is very self-referential stuff, so here Pegg and Frost play two comic book and sci-fi geeks, and best friends, from England, who are in the US (where everyone thinks they are a gay couple!). And they landed in the one and only place of the US where they feel as in home: San Diego Comic Con! This time, I don't think anybody will remember a lot of Pegg and Frost's characters (aside of their new long hair look), like we remember Pegg's Nicholas Angel from HOT FUZZ. It's the sort of point, as they are basically just being themselves (or better said, how we think they really are based on their previous performances), so you know it is a whole lot of fun. I guess all I'm saying is the obvious, as here they aren't the stars. And Seth Rogen's Paul doesn't disappoint as the star. Not at all, as he is one of the most memorable and likable alien characters ever (likable in the he-is-a-cool-bastard kind of way, certainly). You'll love him, and love also his whole background story (too darn memorable to reveal here). It's gold. So if you're into all of these stuff, you know, if you can't wait to check out a movie like ATTACK THE BLOCK, you'll absolute adore Gregg Mottola's third feature as I did (for sure one of my favorites of 2011 so far). I mean, we have hilarious Bill Hader yet again working with Mottola yet again as a cop (an agent to be exact)! If that makes sense to you, get the PAUL DVD/Blu-Ray as soon as possible!",Paul
71,Kamurai25,Seth Rogan's Close Encounter,7,7 June 2020,"Great watch, will watch again, and can recommend.As a fan of Simon Pegg and less of Seth Rogan, it is a weird juxtoposition to have them be the same movie. That said, Kristen Wig seems to be a great way to catalyze the two, with a stellar character choice.Paul is built with just enough plot convince it's not obvious, and the movie hides information from the characters at times and the audience at others in a very clever way with nice surprises sprinkled throughout.",Paul
72,lewiskendell,"Much anticipated, but does it deliver?",6,25 September 2011,"Paul wasn't as gut-bustingly funny as I hoped it would be. After all, it's a Nick Frost/Simon Pegg collaboration that also stars Kristen Wiig, Jane Lynch, Jason Bateman, Bill Hader, the voice of Seth Rogen, and some other famous actors that are best left as surprises. It's a shame that all that talent isn't given a better script, though.I love the idea of Paul as sort of a love letter to those who love science fiction, but as a comedy it's just not as funny as it should have been. Too many of the jokes are frequently nasty pokes at certain groups that weren't funny the first time, much less the fifth. Paul ended up being less of a movie about how science fiction has been a beloved part of countless people's lives for decades, and more of an attack on groups of people that, believe it or not, include individuals that love science fiction, too. To put it bluntly, this is no Shaun of the Dead or Hot Fuzz. The expected references and homages to classic movies in the genre are there, and there's definitely some humor, but Paul just fell below the high expectations I had for it, considering who was involved. On the positive side, the character Paul looked great. I completely forgot that he was a computer generated character as the movie went on, which is always a good thing.",Paul
73,brando647,PAUL is Fun but Forgettable,7,25 September 2011,"In my opinion, PAUL has a lot of similarities to the 2008 film FANBOYS. Both of these films are geek-centric with a lot of the laughs coming from the references to classic science fiction. Whereas FANBOYS relied on these references for pretty much 100% of the humor and would alienate any non (or even casual) STAR WARS fan, PAUL is more accessible to people who might not get all the winks and nods. It's definitely feels like another ""by geeks, for geeks"" film but the characters and the story are fun enough for general audiences to have a good time. Simon Pegg and Nick Frost are Graeme and Clive, a couple of English geeks on vacation in America for Comic Con. After indulging in their fandom at the Con, Graeme and Clive rent an RV for a tour of the west's UFO hotspots. Plans are interrupted by the chance meeting with Paul, an alien who has escaped from a government installation. Paul's ready to leave Earth, but the government has got other plans for him. The trio take off on a road trip to get Paul to his rendezvous point while Agent Zoil and his two government cronies try to track them down.PAUL is a funny movie. It's good for some chuckles and it's got a feel-good vibe. It's not a hilarious film. I'm not even sure I truly laughed at any point in the movie. Cracked plenty of smiles, sure, but the humor is pretty tame here. It's not as excessive as FANBOYS, but a lot of the funny bits are just the throwbacks to movies like BACK TO THE FUTURE, CLOSE ENCOUNTERS, and of course STAR WARS. Paying homage to a beloved film is great, but it's tough to make a consistently funny movie with it. The remainder of the humor comes from excessive vulgarity. I've got nothing against vulgar language in movies and, when done right, can add extra flavor (e.g. PULP FICTION, CLERKS.). Here it's just tossed out and assumed that the audience will laugh at anything ""dirty"". A lot of Paul's character is just how vulgar he is. Sure, it's funny at first...a little grey alien spouting curse words...but it only goes so far. Kristen Wiig is sort of wasted here. She's an excellent comedienne and her character's main quirk is her clumsy cursing. And it's a running gag that just keeps going and going long after it's stopped being amusing.I have a lot of questions when I think back about this movie. How much better would it have been if Edgar Wright had directed? Would it have actually worked better if they'd gone with a PG-13 rating so the filmmakers could've focused on writing better jokes. The cast is great, regardless. It's always awesome to see Simon Pegg and Nick Frost together on screen. Seth Rogen is the voice of Paul. I really didn't know what to expect at first. Rogen has a very distinct voice and I thought it'd be weird for him to voice the title character, but Rogen's voice acting and excellent CG turn Paul into a great character. Wiig, despite suffering from poor dialogue, is lovable as ever. The movie's fun and the characters are enjoyable. I'd be lying if I said it wasn't worth a viewing, especially if you are a fan of the sci-fi classics since this movie is loaded with love for them. PAUL's problem isn't that it doesn't entertain, it's that it's not too memorable. After seeing it in theaters, I'd actually forgotten all about it until I saw the home video ads.",Paul
74,moviewizguy,Who's up for a close encounter?,6,23 February 2011,"For the past 60 years, an alien named Paul has been hanging out at a top-secret military base. For reasons unknown, the space-traveling smart ass decides to escape the compound and hop on the first vehicle out of town -- a rented RV containing Earthlings Graeme Willy and Clive Gollings. Chased by federal agents and the fanatical father of a young woman that they accidentally kidnap, Graeme and Clive hatch a fumbling escape plan to return Paul to his mother ship. And as two nerds struggle to help, one little green man might just take his fellow outcasts from misfits to intergalactic heroes. (C) UniversalI've never really liked comedies so much because comedies released in recent years have ranged from decent to downright awful (not to mention, predictable). The only ones I seem to find memorable and enjoyable are the ones by Judd Apatow and ones that starred the dynamic duo, Simon Pegg and Nick Frost. Well, too bad they didn't have Edgar Wright to complete the perfect team. PAUL isn't any way a horrible film. In fact, it's funny, sweet, and charming. However, it's also predictable, clichéd, and completely forgettable once the credits roll. I chuckled in many places, but I never really laughed out loud.However, what makes the film work is the character of Paul. He's such a vulgar and crude alien, yet endearing and likable at the same time. Seth Rogen was definitely perfect for the role. I didn't think Simon Pegg and Nick Frost had much to do here. They were just playing a variation of their past roles in SHAUN OF THE DEAD and HOT FUZZ. Nothing special. I thought Kristen Wiig and Bill Hader stood out the most. They provide some of the film's most funniest jokes. There's also a cameo by a famous actor/actress that's pretty neat, but I shall not ruin the surprise.One thing I do think that would have made me enjoy the film more was if I were a bigger nerd, and I say that as a compliment. It was obvious there were many pop culture references (to certain sci-fi films and other stuff) but most of them just went over my head. While people sitting next to me were laughing out hysterically, I felt, wait for it...very alienated. Apparently, I'm not that huge of a sci-fi fan than I thought I was.I found PAUL to be decent entertainment to kill off a couple of hours but nothing more. It's like junk food, but I guess you've heard that analogy many times already: It's not good to consume but enjoy it while it lasts.",Paul
75,bob-rutzel-1,Disappointing,8,10 August 2011,"Paul (Voice of Rogan) is an alien who crashed to earth about 60-yrs ago, escapes from Area 51, hitches a ride with Graeme (Pegg) and Clive (Frost), 2-Englishmen on vacation in the USA. Paul is headed toward the landing site where his mother ship will pick him up. When I saw the promos, they made me laugh and I almost ran to get the DVD when it became available. I will never learn. I have the tendency to believe in what I think are good things much too quickly. Woe is me. In a nutshell, they are being chased by gov't agents, Ruth's (Wiig) religious fanatical father, and 2-burly biker types (sorry, didn't know what else to call them) who drove an SUV, not bikes So the plot is a simple one and had the capacity for some big yuks. Didn't happen. It took about a half hour before Paul comes on the scene and the banter between Graeme and Clive before that was nothing but lame and that lameness continued throughout. They were never funny.Ruth becomes a veritable dictionary of profanity when Paul convinces her they (people of earth) are not alone in the universe. So she decides to go against everything religious she believed in. Her profanity laced dialogue was meant to be funny, I am sure. Just didn't happen and it was embarrassing and annoying. Segourney Weaver was okay as the voice to agent Zoil (Bateman) but was not convincing when she physically shows up near the end. Kind of awkward scenes with her. (So you didn't like most of it. What did you like?) I thought Rogan as the voice of Paul was pure genius. He had some good lines but could have been given more. In a flashback to his Area 51 days Paul is on the phone with Steven Spielberg (his actual voice we are told) who is writing ET and we are reminded of Forest Gump and Elvis.I liked Jason Bateman who is becoming quite an accomplished actor. He's fun to watch. The CGI for Paul was exceptional. I guess it was CGI. That wasn't a real alien, was it? Huh?At the end of the movie when the space ship is lifting off and our characters are watching in the foreground, we see other human-like figures in the background far left. Who were they? Ah, someone goofed. Overall, not funny, lame dialogue and sight gags and. well, just disappointing. Violence: Yes. Sex: No. Nudity: No. Crude sexual content: Yes, loaded.

77,Troy_Campbell,Will have you smiling from start to finish.,6,19 April 2011,"Comedic duo Pegg and Frost are meant for each other. They share a dude-chemistry like so few male pairings on the big screen do. They've not put a foot wrong when working together, with both Shaun of the Dead and Hot Fuzz delivering comedy gold. This nerdy road trip flick marks their third filmic partnership and, unsurprisingly due to the high calibre of their previous output, it's their least successful effort yet. It lacks the ambitious and biting humour we've come to expect from them, offering a chilled out adventure instead. In lieu of the belly laughs delivered by Shaun and Fuzz, it will have you smiling from start to finish. Comparisons to their own work aside, Paul is a laidback and amusing homage to the sci-fi genre that is still better than majority of the trash that hits our cinemas calling itself 'comedy'.Those who usually shun science fiction films (or T.V. for that matter) need not avoid Paul. The screenplay – written by the multitalented Pegg and Frost – is accessible to all levels of fans of sci-fi and comedy in general. If your total experience of extraterrestrial tales is E.T. or Alien, or the only film featuring time-travel you've seen is Back to the Future, then there is plenty ingrained into the story for you to enjoy. If you're a more devout sci-fi geek then there's a multitude of stuff for you to sink your teeth into as well, including 'Battlestar Galactica' and 'Star Trek' gags. Those who just want a chuckle and care little for the plethora of hidden references then you're catered for as well. There's a string of running gags – most notably Kristen Wiig's newfound joy of swearing – littered throughout and a game supporting cast featuring regular humorists Bateman, Hader, Wiig and Lynch in addition to acting stalwarts Danner and Weaver, who all have their moments in the spotlight.And then of course, there's Paul. An entirely CGI being with stoner-comedian Rogen's voice, Paul is a unique little creature indeed. Although he doesn't convince 100% – the CGI is fine, it's just Rogen's accent never quite matches the physical look – the eponymous alien is certainly an entertaining character to hang out with nevertheless. He has a filthy vocabulary – ""Hey F***nuts, it's probing time"" – and an even filthier sense of humour. I can understand why Graeme and Clive would go to the lengths they do to help Paul, with his potbelly figure and propensity towards chillaxing with some fine weed, it's just impossible not to like him.An impressive entry into Pegg and Frost's joint resume, even if it doesn't stand toe-to-toe to their prior outings.3.5 out of 5 (1 - Rubbish, 2 - Average, 3 - Good, 4 - Great, 5 - Brilliant)",Paul
78,dunmore_ego,Kind Encounters of the Close Third.,7,14 August 2011,"It's a comedy of the crude kind, a road movie of the chase kind, a close encounter of the third kind! Hey, isn't that Roger from American DAD? Or do all aliens just look alike to me?...Two Brits on a pilgrimage to famed UFO sites in Nevada pick up a real extraterrestrial alien on the run, named Paul, and find themselves targets of a manhunt (a little green man-hunt) from government spooks (Bill Hader, Joe Lo Truglio and FBI agent Jason Bateman, playing it cooler than a polar bear drinking Coca-Cola).Simon Pegg and Nick Frost are the two Brits, Graeme Willy and The Writer Clive Gollings (that's how he introduces himself - hilarious! I gotta start doing that! - for the sci-fi story he has spent his adult life penning, with Graeme providing the cover artwork - a hot alien chick with three breasts, which seemingly has the same effect on everyone, human or alien, without even reading the story - ""three titties: awesome!"").Pegg and Frost (as co-writers of this film) do a great job of capturing that uncomfortable vestige of American jingoism when they ask a Mexican concierge, ""Do you believe in aliens?"" and he suspiciously replies, ""What do you mean, 'aliens'?"" Alien Paul is a CG entity thrown amongst this real life comedy, styled after the infamous ""grays,"" with big eyes, big head and tiny gray-green body. Voiced by Seth Rogen, Paul is pretty much just an easygoing stoner dude, who has been filling his time on Earth since his crash landing in the 50s working with the government and dabbling in giving Spielberg movie ideas. Now he's on the run from that same government, and lamenting that all his fictional ideas - like Mulder and Scully - are being attributed to others.The trio pick up Creationist fanatic Ruth (Kristen Wiig), whom Paul mind-melds with to make her understand evolution, whereupon she realizes she can fornicate and drink and cuss all she wants. The great character actor John Carroll Lynch joins the chase as Ruth's bible-thumping father.Add points to movie for its atheist stance. Paul laments about Creationists, ""You just can't talk to these people!"" Subtract points for the character paradox: UFO fanatics Graeme and The Writer Clive Gollings claim to be ""men of science"" and they poo-poo Ruth claiming the Earth was created in five days and is 4,000 years old. And so they should... Yet they believe the government is hiding crashed extraterrestrial spacecraft at Area 51. You just can't talk to these people! PAUL is a fun romp across the Nevada desert, a straightforward action chase comedy, yet the story contains a lot of heart and is touching in places, with the payoffs hitting well; with innumerable nods and winks to iconic extraterrestrial movies, among others, E.T., ALIENS, STAR WARS, and the greatest extraterrestrial movie of all time, CLOSE ENCOUNTERS OF THE THIRD KIND. We even see the greatest alien fighter of all - Sigourney Weaver in a surprise cameo.And of course, Jeffrey Tambor as vain, cynical sci-fi writer-god Adam Shadowchild.

So begins the road trip element of ""Paul"". The humour begins when they meet Paul, an alien, on the run from the men in black. Some of the humour is along the lines of Clive peeing his pants when he sees Paul—yes, pretty childish, but funny enough.The film is an homage to, and a spoof of, all the alien movies and stories. It also includes all the classic elements of Hollywood stories, romance, love, friendship, death-defying situations, but it all works. Rather than being its downfall, it is its saving grace.Of course at the heart of all this is Paul (Seth Rogen), the classic grey alien with a big head and all-seeing blue eyes. And yes, he smokes pot, but no, he does not perform anal probes. Seth Rogen is Seth Rogen, but I like him, I find him funny, endearing, and real, and all of that charm comes through in Paul.I laughed most of the way through ""Paul"". I'm not a comic book geek, so I'm sure I probably even missed half of their alien pop culture jokes. The humour ranges from silly and adolescent to biting religious commentary, and it mostly works.

The two pals head to Comic-Con and are living life when they stumble upon Paul, an on-the-run alien who's looking for a little assistance. He's being chased by dingus FBI agents, and basically, that's it. Save Paul, learn life-lessons along the way. Ugh.Gotta admit, this didn't do much for me. Besides the treasure trove of movie nods this movie dishes out, there are only a couple redeeming aspects. Of course, the acting is solid, as all involved are truly talented actors. Well, I should say Simon and Nick weren't that funny, as they wrote this thing, and only fanboys and poindexters will truly find this worthwhile.There's lot here to complain about. Be it the lackluster bad guys chase good guys, or the reliance on hearing Paul or whatsherface swear to make you laugh, or the super lame gay jokes....it was just a total wash. And how many times did they use the triple boob joke? The film had a nice light vibe about it all, which will sucker you right along with it, but the filler - the cliché filler combined with the very disappointing writing, will have many people (probably not you though, because you GET humor) feeling pretty let-down. I know I was.And this leads me into my college approved thesis for my Film Studies class - the Mac and Me vs. Paul throwdown! As I mentioned earlier, more than any other aspect of the film, they succeeded big time on the movie nod front. They even said the word, 'Butthorn'. Only a select few will know where that's from. They also mentioned the film Mac and Me - a timeless classic family movie that revolves around a little alien connecting with a little handicapped boy all while trying to find his family. What I'm trying to get at is, what is the better of the two films? Paul, a big-budget scifi/action comedy with big name stars, or Mac and Me, a average budget film that is sponsored by Coca-Cola products? Let's get it on!Paul has swear words, Mac and Me does not. But Paul relies on swears words for laughs, and that's never a good thing. Mac wins this round.Paul the alien is voiced by Seth Rogen; a bulbous Jew who sounds like he has a toad in his throat. Mac is a non-speaking alien played by some no name actor that communicates by whistling. Mac wins again.There is a dance sequence in Paul where they dance to crappy music around a camp-fire. In Mac and Me there is a legendary dance scene at a McDonalds with break-dancing and awesome 80s beats. Mac + 1.Paul has a mediocre sounding mainstream soundtrack. Mac and Me has a soundtrack with amazing ballads and again, awesome 80s tunes. Mac for the win again.Paul is a comedy that tries to splice in dramatic elements to no affect; it's neither funny (minus a couple giggles) nor emotional. Mac and Me is a family film that delivers an emotional roller-coaster of a ride as you watch Mac's family starve to death and Mac himself suffer tremendously. Mac with another easy win.Paul like Mac had some action in it. Paul had a couple shoot-outs and some car stunts. Mac has a stunt where a dude in a wheelchair jumps off a cliff into a quarry, another stunning wheelchair stunt in high-speed traffic, huge explosions, chased by dogs....Paul is about an obnoxious alien who has the heart of a frat boy. He smokes, swears, and make witty quips. Mac is a curious little fella who doesn't complain, drinks soda, eats skittles, and can whistle dixie in your face! Mac!Paul has special abilities. He turns invisible, can pass knowledge to others by physical means, and can heal living beings. Mac can whistle, break-dance, stretch his limbs, roll like a ball, flatten like a pancake, put his hands into the position of a 'big vagina' ala Larry David to communicate with his family, is fire-proof, AND can heal living beings. Beat that hot shot! Enough is enough. The bottom line here is Paul was a disappointing film that didn't bring anything new or cool or funny to the table. Mac and Me, is hard to beat in any comparison.",Paul
81,Andy-296,Starts well but loses steam; only intermittently funny,6,27 January 2012,"Two British nerds (who seem to be on their thirties) go to San Diego for the Comic-Con, apparently a very huge Comic Book convention. A running gag in the film is that everybody assumes incorrectly that these two are gays - though this is never stated, it is likely that these thirty-something losers are virgins. On their return trip, they decide to rent a huge van to visit sites in the US West related to UFO conspiracies (Area 51, Roswell). On the road, they find an actual alien, the Paul of the title, who is diminutive, grumpy and foulmouthed, among other things, and is on the run from some Man in Black types who has held him imprisoned in a secret base for decades. The three soon see themselves on the lam, not just from the US agents, but also from some rednecks and a Christian fundamentalist who believes they have kidnapped his grown one-eyed daughter. All this is funnier on paper than on film. The best part is the first fifteen minutes, with its pointed satire of Nerd culture. After that, the film loses steam.This is the first film I have seen from the British comic duo of Simon Pegg and Nick Frost (they wrote the film and starred in it), and I must say that I wasn't too impressed with them. The movie never reaches its potential and is only intermittently funny. Also, I must say that for a semi mainstream movie, its mockery of Christian people is pretty pointed and harsh.",Paul
82,MrGKB,"Genre references are nice, but...",6,23 October 2011,"...they can't really carry a movie the distance, and neither can a wise-cracking, foul-mouthed alien road companion. Simon ""Shaun of the Dead"" Pegg and Nick ""ditto"" Frost's latest foray into the world of nebbish pals just doesn't work as well as the aforementioned ""Shaun..."" or ""Hot Fuzz,"" and to a great extent I think this is because they've Americanized their stock in trade. The result is a substitution of crassness and overkill for wit and subtlety. There are moments that work wonderfully (and more often with the supporting characters than the leads), and too many others that fall flat, like the love interest's unfettered vocabulary. The acting is fine; Pegg & Frost have a good rapport, supports like Kristen ""SNL"" Wiig, Bill ""SNL"" Hader, John Carroll ""Fargo"" Lynch, Joe ""Pineapple Express"" Lo Truglio, and most particularly Jason ""Arrested Development"" Bateman assay their roles well. Seth ""Superbad"" Rogen voices the titular lead with assurance, rounding out a cast that has, for the most part, worked well with director Greg ""Adventureland"" Mottola before. The CGI work is good; Paul is a believably present character and not a cartoon insert, which helps the disappointing script immensely.Despite all the pluses, the minuses outweigh, and the drabness of most of the humor can't lift the film out of the realm of forgettable. At film's end, one can only wonder what it might have been like had Pegg and Simon stuck closer to home with a similar story. Watchable, but sadly dispensable.",Paul
83,KnightsofNi11,"Sure it's not a comedic masterpiece, but its a lot of fun",7,26 March 2011,"It's been a long wait, but finally, for the first time since 2007 Simon Pegg and Nick Frost team up once again as the unstoppably funny duo. Their pairing this time isn't quite at the same quality of comedy as Hot Fuzz or Shaun of the Dead but let's face it, those two movies are comedy gold. Paul is still hilarious and it is rife with highly quotable jokes that you can laugh about for days. Plus it has plenty of great nerdy sci-fi humor that only us true geeks and catch on to. Paul follows two British tourists in America, Graeme (Pegg) and Clive (Frost) who are traveling cross-country to visit all of the most famous UFO sightings in America. While in Area 51 they pick up a hitchhiking alien named Paul who is excellently voiced by Seth Rogen. Graeme and Clive quickly learn that agreeing to protect this extraterrestrial is giving them a lot more than they bargained for as they are chased by the FBI, hillbillies, and a religious shotgun toting nut job.If there's one thing I can commend Paul on, it's finally giving us the satisfaction of an R rated sci-fi comedy. The blend of the two genres is great and making it a vulgar, violent riot is just what fans needed with so many lame PG-13 comedies floating around these days. Pegg and Frost wrote a hilarious script for this movie, one that easily could have been ruined by a few edits to suit a PG-13 rating. But thankfully they got to keep it their way and give us something obscenely entertaining.Paul isn't one of those profound comedies that breaks the barriers of typical comedy or goes unforgettably above and beyond, but it is really funny. The jokes are hilarious almost every time. It's not high brow comedy by any means and there are a number of fart jokes, gay jokes, poop jokes, and so on and so forth, but I can't say that they didn't make me laugh because I most certainly did. But as an added bonus the film is filled to the brim with sci-fi film references. They range from blatant, like a set of fireworks that make the Close Encounters of the Third Kind tone, to as subtle as the band in the bar playing the Mos Eisley cantina song from Star Wars. This has got to be one of the nerdiest scripts ever written, and I absolutely loved it. I'm sure there are a number of references I missed or didn't get, but that's just because every little thing is a reference to some sort of sci-fi film or theme. To quote the Brits, ""It's brilliant!"" There's no two ways about it, Paul is cast perfectly. Pegg and Frost are obviously excellent and you couldn't find a better duo of British nerds anywhere. Seth Rogen does a surprisingly good job voicing the alien, whose animations are also excellent and add a lot of comedy to the film. Other supporting characters are great in their roles, like Kristen Wiig playing the neurotic ex-Christian Ruth Buggs. Jason Bateman plays a straight man role as the FBI agent leading the chase after Paul and he is hilarious in his own deadpan way. Bill Hader and Joe Lo Truglio play two other FBI agents who make a hilarious little side pair of characters who have their own running jokes and quirks. Then there are tons of cameos from very recognizable actors such and Jeffrey Tambor, Janey Lynch, David Koechner, and even Sigourney Weaver. There's hardly an actor in this film that I don't go, ""Hey! I recognize that guy"" when I seem him or her.Paul by no means transcends the comedy genre but it is no doubt funny. If you don't find at least some of the humor in this film amusing then there is something wrong with you. Sure it's cheesy at moments, OK it can be predictable at times, but as a comedy it really works and it gave me a solid hour and forty minutes of great entertainment. If you love a good R rated comedy, go see this movie, and if you're a sci-fi nerd you have to see this movie just for the fun of catching references. This is a great little comedy that is plenty of fun to watch.",Paul

A bit of the de rigueur ""bad boy"" elan, but with integrity",8,17 May 2011,"A rollicking good time, punctuated with 1) real pathos and 2) moments of wince-inducing (but ultimately forgivable) camp. Fine writing, great directing and acting. The technical work on Paul's physical presence was a delight to see. They captured Rogen's (and stand-in's) facial expressions and teased them onto the alien face with nuance and artistry.But what about the story? It's got an alien, it's got rednecks, it's got Brits, it's got a faceless fearless leader; all the timeless elements of an aliens-among-us conspiracy riddled yarn. It's got bad guys, it's got good guys, it's got some odd turnabouts.And, by the story's end, there are a few lessons.If you're a sci-fi nerd, you definitely have to see it!",Paul
85,Ruskington,Pegg and Frost's tamest effort so far,5,23 September 2020,"I'm generally a fan of Pegg and Frost movies but 'Paul' left me feeling a little disappointed. I'm not sure if it was a result of being intentionally aimed at a wider market, but the dry British humour that made Shaun of the Dead so brilliant was sadly nowhere to be seen. And whoever decided to give the voiceover role to Seth Rogen really screwed up. Rogen's voice is just too distinct (and no to mention, annoying) to transfer onto an animated character. Perfectly watchable but way too lightweight and surprisingly bland.",Paul
86,ajs-10,"Not the funniest thing I've ever seen, but not all that bad either",7,11 March 2012,"Very well made with some nice CGI work and effects; I also very much liked the choice of music, but if you open with 'Another Girl, Another Planet' by The Only Ones you've got me right there! All the performances were pretty good, although I particularly liked Kristen Wiig as Ruth Buggs, she really stood out for me performance-wise. Of the others, well, Simon Pegg as Graeme Willy and Nick Frost as Clive Gollings pretty much did what they usually do and Seth Rogen as the voice of Paul was just about what I expected. I'll give honourable mentions to; Jason Bateman as Agent Zoil, Bill Hader as Haggard, Joe Lo Truglio as O'Reilly and, not forgetting, Sigourney Weaver as The Big Guy.A film littered with nods and homage's to many classic sci-fi movies; you could spend hours going through it and noting them all. This could be distracting, but, as it's a comedy, I'll let it slide (this time). I thought the theological question was handled quite well, although I can see it not going down too well in certain quarters. It's a well scripted piece although I did get the feeling it had been very much 'tweaked' towards the American market; although a couple of 'Brit' in-jokes did squeak through. I must say I did enjoy it though and, at the end of the day, it did what it said on the tin. I was afraid it would go off in a certain direction at one point, but in the end they managed to steer it home! Would I watch it again?... Yes!...

88,Prichards12345,Hit and Miss but more of the former,7,21 April 2012,"Paul isn't really up to the same standard as Shaun Of The Dead and Hot Fuzz but it's an engaging, reasonably funny flick. Several laugh-out loud moments and a general air of amiability bring it home; and it's sort of a living proof us geeks are inheriting the earth!Simon Pegg and Nick Frost play two British Nerds having the holiday of a lifetime at the San Diego Comic-Con and they have a subsequent plan to travel to the famous UFO hot zones in the region. And it isn't long before they run into a real living alien (a superbly blended CGI creation voiced by Seth Rogen) in dire need of rescue from the government agents trying to hunt him down.As you'd expect there's a whole welter of movie and sci-fi references, and Pegg and Frost's script keeps things ticking over nicely.

89,JohnRayPeterson,"Cheeky, cheesy, yummy. See it.",8,14 June 2011,"I've been putting off writing a review about this movie because it's surprisingly difficult to be serious when you're replaying the scenes of ""Paul"" in your mind. Once more I refer you to a useful four tier definition of 'sense of humour' included in my review of the movie ""Due Date"". The movie ""Paul"" (I like its catchy and easy to remember title, easy to remember for a series of complex psychological theorems nobody will read so I'll skip that) is a funny and, dare I say it, original movie. It will be a happy entertaining activity to watch it and seems to be for most as the ratings, critics and other reviews bear so far.I should be embarrassed for not having seen the previous adventures of the duo of Simon Pegg and Nick Frost, since I'm familiar with their individual work in other movies and have often bragged of being a fan of British humour; my face is red. It's not red from shame (I'm a former catholic – all degrees of shame have dissipated long ago); I like to eat hot pepper and spicy pepperoni with ice Coke in the summer or while writing reviews like this one. I'm making a note to try to watch ""Shaun of the Dead"" and ""Hot Fuzz"" but it's not a firm commitment to do so.Back to ""Paul""; the trailers had me hooked and I was quite certain the premise, especially the animated or animatronics character ""Paul"" who's voice-over was that of Seth Rogen, was going to be a potential buffet for funny dialogue and off the wall humour. I was satisfied the movie hit all those marks for me. It's a playful fun movie, a cerebral slapstick kind of thing. The supporting cast, SNL bunch in part, did their job well. Don't miss it when it comes out on DVD/Blue-Ray; get the unrated version as I plan to do.",Paul
90,Likes_Ninjas90,Pegg and Frost might have written this for an American audience but it's not what I'd call particularly funny or witty. Phone home gentlemen,4,8 April 2011,"Best friends Graeme Willy (Simon Pegg) and Clive Gollings (Nick Frost) are a pair of science-fiction geeks, travelling across America in a mobile RV. They first visit the Comic-Con convention and then move through the Nevada Desert because they are interested in the supposed alien sightings. Along the way they witness a car crash on the side of the road. Investigating the vehicle, they meet Paul (voiced by Seth Rogen), a foul mouthed and obnoxious alien. While he happens to share a lot of the same eating habits as the pair, he also has special healing powers. Paul reveals he has escaped from Area 51, after being held a prisoner. He needs the boys to help take him to an extraction point so he can return home. Along the way the group is chased by some government troops, including Agent Zoil (Jason Bateman) and a father and daughter pair of Christian extremists. The girl is Ruth (Kristen Wiig) and when she ends up on the RV Graeme takes a liking to her. With a resounding thud, Simon Pegg and Nick Frost have crashed landed together in Hollywood. This is their first reteaming since Hot Fuzz, leaving behind director Edgar Wright, to work with Greg Mottola instead. He previously made Superbad. As someone who thoroughly enjoyed Hot Fuzz and Shaun of the Dead, the disappointment with this sci-fi comedy is its distinct Americanisation and its weakened script. It's unusual considering Pegg and Frost are credited as writers and it's been developed by their regular production companies. The satire of their other two films, which cleverly took aim at specific genre films and the way they mirrored British society, is now absent. The comedy here is broader and cruder, but not necessarily funnier. It resorts to drawing American stereotypes, from hillbillies, self-serious government agents and most alarmingly, born again Christians, but with little to no purpose. There are a few laughs early on when the boys visit Comic-Con because there's no winking required. Comic-Con is what it is: geeks, some a lot older than others, dressing up in ridiculous costumes. There's also a fun cameo by Jeffrey Tambor, from Hellboy 2, as an obnoxious author. From the point that the alien arrives though, the cracks in the setup and the screenplay come to the foray. We see that Paul has the traits of a boorish human, without any explanation and then there's really nowhere for the film to go. The blame must be shared by Mottola because the film has been cut to resemble a chase movie. And the number of times that the group find themselves escaping in the RV from various pursuers grows increasingly tiresome. If one were to watch it for the sci-fi references rather than the narrative then there's a predictable assortment of E.T. and Alien related gags. There's bound to be some that only science- fiction enthusiasts will find but the most obvious ones are not as skilfully integrated into the plot as say Hot Fuzz's take on the English murder mystery. It's more like a gallery for these sci-fi allusions than a proper film. One of the strengths of Hot Fuzz was quality of its script, with visible changes and developments in the characters. It was also buoyed considerably by Pegg's acting chops, playing a character that was deliberately straight throughout and letting the jokes work around him. There's a lot less Pegg can do here with a surprisingly blank character, caught somewhere between an overgrown geek and a bumbling, quirky Englishman. I wanted more laughs from him because he is a genuinely funny actor. Frost again looks to be playing the typical slob but he's slightly more interesting because he's the more skeptical of the two about Paul. The gimmick of Rogen voicing an alien who smokes and swears, wears off very quickly and Kristen Wiig has such a worthless role here that it's a wonder she agreed to it. She's made to look stupid as she overplays her transformation from a Christian extremist to a foul- mouthed pot smoker. Jason Bateman, a reliable character actor, has an equally inane part and we don't care about his role. Pegg and Frost might have written this for an American audience but it's not what I'd call particularly funny or witty. Phone home gentlemen.",Paul
91,Christian_Dimartino,The years biggest disappointment.,5,17 July 2011,"Simon Pegg and Nick Frost return once again for an American comedy called Paul, the years biggest letdown. Pegg and Frost are geniuses, especially when they did films with director Edgar Wright. But Paul is directed by Greg Mattola(Superbad), and you'd still expect better.Pegg and Frost play two nerds who travel to America for Comic-con and to see famous U.F.O places. That is, until they meet one. They meet Paul(voiced by Seth Rogen) a fat alien with a foul mouth. But Paul doesn't speak a different language, which I found interesting.There are government agents, led by Lorenzo Zoil(the evil Jason Bateman) and a mysterious woman, who are trying to hunt down Paul. Along the way, the two nerds meet a Christian girl(Kristen Wiig) who goes on the run with them.The film has a few laughs, but I found my self getting annoyed by all the talk of evolution. They try to ram it down your throat, and itgot on my nerves. I also found it to drag on a bit after a while, and it shouldn't have.What Pegg and Frost did with Shaun of the dead and Hot Fuzz, besides being English comedies(which tend to be better), was smart and original, and hilarious. But Paul isn't really any of those. It took four years for the guys to come back, and this is what they came back with? Its not terrible, but next time I hope they don't make an American comedy.B-",Paul
92,anselmdaniel,Hilarious homages,8,29 May 2021,"This review contains spoilers.Paul is a science fiction comedy movie that premiered in 2011. The movie features two friends that embark on a road trip into America's UFO homeland. The movie characterizes their misadventures in the road trip.Paul is a solid comedy movie. There is much to enjoy in this movie from Simon Pegg and Ed Frost's performances to the witty dialogue. The movie does a great job with portraying the insane comedy that results from a discovery of an extra-terrestrial. The movie makes these scenes intensely enjoyable. I had a blast watching the movie going from scene to scene featuring homages to older movies.Paul's issue is that the movie is not particularly memorable. I enjoyed watching the movie however, the movie did not distinguish itself completely in the genre. There are cliches in this movie that it pokes fun at but it does not create a unique situation.I would recommend ""Paul"".Grade: B.",Paul
93,DonFishies,"Funny, but has so much squandered potential",6,16 March 2011,"Great comedies can inarguably walk the line between being hilarious and being heartfelt. So many comedies fail at balancing this line that it undoubtedly becomes increasingly harder to nail down the perfect formula for what really works versus what does not. But for some comedies, they are more than just great. They are timeless and created so well, almost by accident, that one can endlessly quote from them, and even allow them to become part of their everyday vernacular. Sure you may be stealing and you may end up being completely unoriginal (attested by those who quote The Hangover, Wedding Crashers and the 92-words that make up the full title for Borat a bit too often), but these sorts of films stand up for some period of time, and sometimes become classics mentioned in the same breath as Oscar-winners.This brings me to Paul, which in writing, sounds like a comedic goldmine. It is written by Simon Pegg and Nick Frost, the British imports who headlined Shaun of the Dead and Hot Fuzz, easily two of the best comedies of the last decade (Pegg was also responsible for co-writing both with Edgar Wright, who was suspiciously missing here). It is directed by Greg Mottola, who directed the hilarious Superbad and wrote/directed the greatly underrated Adventureland. The film revolves around two British comic book geeks named Graeme and Clive (Pegg and Frost) who run into the title character, a foul-mouthed alien (voiced by slacker poster-child Seth Rogen) who is on the run from the government. Like all ""good"" aliens, Paul just wants to go home, so despite the great danger, Graeme and Clive set out to help him.I wanted to adore Paul, but sadly, it was not meant to be. I cannot pin point the exact moment where the film veers off the tracks and became almost embarrassing to watch. The idea for the film, and almost the entirety of the first act seemingly suggested it really had a lot going for it. But as the film really amps up, and the plot really starts to come to fruition, it just starts to unravel piece by piece. When two of the biggest plot points in a science-fiction parody film are perceived homosexuality and the inability to accept the concept of evolution, you must know something has gone horribly wrong from idea to final product.What made Shaun of the Dead and Hot Fuzz so great was that they took their respective genres (zombie horror and buddy cop action thrillers) and created brilliant parodies that captured exactly what was wrong and so lovable about their genres. In the process, they ended up creating films that could stand alongside the films they were parodying, and easily became one of the best films in that very genre. This must have been the initial goal with Paul for Pegg and Frost, but instead they helped create a contrived film that is not all that funny. It has all the references and suggested lines that I figured it would have, and even adds some clever ideas about how Paul may have helped influence every alien entry into pop culture (a conversation with Steven Spielberg about how he should make E.T. is of particular note).Paul's biggest problem, unlike its British counterparts, is quite simply that it does not have a good enough story to fill in around the references. It has a misguided idea of where it wants to go, and as a result, seems to move along for a few moments before running straight into certain ideas and situations just for the sake of adding in a reference (do we really need a bar scene with a hick band playing the Cantina song from Star Wars?). It never seems able to stay on a relatively straight path, and it suffers and wavers along as a result of it. When it starts to get into the headier subjects like homosexuality and religion, it begins to look like it has no idea what it wants to be at all. I realize that Pegg and Frost likely wanted to take a big shot at Americans with adding these ideas in (despite the film being American made), but they have no place here. They feel like they were added simply to add extra conflict to a plot whose biggest conflict is not strong enough to maintain the film's lean 95-minute runtime. But then, that suggests another problem – where was Mottola on all this? Why does it seem like most of the comedic control was left to Pegg and Frost? Mottola has proved himself a worthy comedic director, so why does the film seem to merely exist to try and copy what made Shaun and Fuzz so great? So many questions, but not nearly enough answers.Pegg and Frost do what they can to shine in their roles, but look uncomfortable in most of their scenes. Rogen seems to be in a vacuum between overused and underused. Like the plot, it does not seem able to figure out what it really wants to do with him. And let me tell you, hearing Rogen swear his face off as a computer generated alien is only funny the first three-times he does it, not for the entire film. Kristen Wiig and Jason Bateman have a few funny moments, but are never really given a moment to really make something of their characters. Joe Lo Truglio and especially Bill Hader are likely the funniest characters in the whole film, but they are not used nearly enough.There are a lot of hilarious moments sprinkled throughout Paul, and more than enough elements to have made an enjoyable film. But they are never cohesive enough to hold the film together. It is a tragic disappointment, considering all of the talent involved. As a Pegg/Frost fan, I hoped for so much more.6.5/10.(This review also appeared on http://www.geekspeakmagazine.com).",Paul
94,Mr_Sensitive,Highly Entertaining,7,24 October 2011,"The difference between their previous two movies was I didn't read the review and so I didn't really have any expectation for this movie at all. I guess that is a very good thing because I can really enjoy this movie for what it really is and not because of Simon and Nick were in it.The story about the two British sci-fi nerds (Graeme and Clive) sightseeing across United State to various UFO sighted spot, that until one night they encountered PAUL, an alien escape from an Area 51. Chase after by federal agents and couple hillbilly they must find their way to send PAUL home.Yes, there is absolutely nothing new in the story; like watching the grownup version of ET: Extraterrestrial. Still I didn't quite bother much by that since I didn't see ET in ages. And I thought they did manage to write PAUL character very well – he is a very lovable character despite his slacker foul mouthed behavior. He is also pretty funny too.I think the story is well pace and I don't really feel bored at all. Though not really many laugh-out-loud moment the movie was fun from the start to the very end.Despite this is a Simon and Nick's movie but I think PAUL really steals the show here. He seems to be everywhere with his foul witted mouth. The bad part was I wish there should be more screen time for all the bad guys. Not much has been emphasis on it.Overall I enjoy this movie throughout. It definitely work well especially if you watch it with your friends when you have nothing to do.Recommendation: Yes, definitely worth a watch.Rating: 7/10 (Grade: B-)",Paul
95,policy134,An alien named after a dog. Clever? Yes,5,25 October 2012,"There are so many parts that are wonderful in this slight, but fun homage/parody to every major science fiction film ever made. Especially, to one of the all time greats of that genre, who even contributes to the fun himself. And if you don't know who I'm talking about, maybe you won't be that interested in Paul anyway. However, it does suffer from poor pacing, especially the ending which seems endless. Everyone knows that Nick Frost and Simon Pegg are two of filmdom's greats, but they seem to be too much in love with all that they wrote. This could have been at least 20 minutes shorter.Still, there is great stuff here. Jabs at Christian fundamentalism, of course the government and an all time great explanation of why every film and TV show uses the same caricature of the alien. It was Paul, get it? Some of the supporting parts are too much caricature also, instead of full bodied characters, but mostly they are funny with some exceptions. I don't know why Bill Hader is in this? His character is hateful without being funny. Even Jason Bateman, not known for outrageous comedy, kicks his butt.Is this enough to recommend Paul? Not really, because of the worst part. The actual alien. Voiced by Seth Rogen, we instantly know it's Seth Rogen, we see it's a Seth Rogen character in animated form and to be honest, I really don't think he is a great comic actor. The characters of Graeme and Clive are mostly straight men but I actually thought they were a hundred times funnier.As a last remark: A great bit from the always dependable Jeffrey Tambor as a cynic.

Sound familiar ? It should, since it is pretty much how all of us feel about life in general...I'm not going to detail the whole movie, but with Sigourney Weaver in it, as Paul's nemesis with evil intentions, and more than a few weird Earthlings thrown in for flavor, the movie ends up as an excellent portrait of just how strange we appear to those aliens, heh heh...",Paul

But I watched it for a second time because my wife hadnt seen it and I really enjoyed it much more the second time. Pegg and Frost have such great rapport and chemistry and the film is full of terrific actors - Kristen Wiig, Bill Hader, Jason Bateman, etc. The film pokes a lot of fun at ET and other sci-fi alien films. I really liked the Wiig character and that she was a repressed woman trapped at a RV park by a crazy religious father. As she tasted freedom for the first time with the guys, she tries to make up for last time w/ cursing and partying. Some nice cameos by Jeffrey Tambor, Jane Lynch and also Sigourney Weaver.

A vacation at comic-con to meet their favorite writer turns into a trip through the states to new Mexico to see some infamous objects from the Roswell alien sightings in 1947. Their trip turns into an adventure when they meet a friendly little alien named Paul. (Seth Rogen.) what leads is reference after reference and comic genius that was worth more than the money I paid to see it.The good: The humor was well written, the acting was good enough to pass, and the constant reference to star wars, star trek, men in black and E.T. is awesome.The Bad: The Swearing is overly excessive. I'm not kidding. With a movie like scarface I can understand a non-stop barrage of F-bombs, But with a colorful range of curses that were used, the swearing jokes got old quick. Also, If you're a Christian, let me warn you, there are a few anti-religious jokes, but they're mostly aimed at Religious extremists (you know, Christians who are brainwashed, ones who carry shotguns and kill people they think are possessed) not so much religion itself.Bottom line, I recommend this flick to those in the male 14 to 40 year old range (Cause a majority of the humor is aimed at that age group) And i give this film a 9/10",Paul

I haven't seen any other Simon Pegg and Nick Frost movies, and this movie didn't really make me want to. I really couldn't care less for Paul himself, I mean if he had been captured and disected than I probably would have just shrugged and sighed. Also the Sigorney Weaver cameo was way too obvious, no, I am not putting a spoiler alert down, if you know who Sigorney Weaver is, then you will know she is in this movie the first time you hear her voice. Now there are things I did like, but most of them were the science fiction elements, I loved whenever they would make a reference to a science fiction film, and the Steven Spielberg voice cameo was awesome.

104,LCShackley,Simon's track record goes down a peg,5,20 September 2011,"I'm a big fan of Simon Pegg and have watched most of his TV shows as well as his movies. PAUL is a huge disappointment. It is based on a good kernel of an idea, and there are loads of funny bits (like Pegg's earlier movies, many laughs depend on your knowledge of OTHER movies). But the amount of profanity in this movie spoiled it for me. I don't talk that way, my friends don't talk that way; why should I listen to actors talk that way for 100 minutes? I was also disappointed that one of the main plot devices is an continuous mockery of Christians and their faith. (Kristin Wiig - one of my least favorite actresses on this or any planet - plays a fundamentalist creationist whose faith is undermined by Paul, and turns into an endless fountain of absurd curses and coprolalia.) Oh, that's SO funny...SO funny. In case you don't see or hear much British comedy, that kind of religion-bashing par for the course on the BBC these days. In fact, the script has an American character use the adjective ""God-bothering,"" which Pegg clearly didn't realize is a UK expression. So ""boo"" to Simon and Nick for letting a good idea go off the rails. (I'm not commenting on Seth Rogen, because I can safely say I have never seen any of his movies and don't intend to.) If you are renting this disc, you should be aware of two things about the disc itself. First, it is programmed to FORCE you to watch all previews; you can't FF, you can't skip a chapter, you can't cut to the menu. Second, the studio has removed ALL the special features from the rental disc and puts a smug little note on the screen if you try to watch one.",Paul
105,HelenMary,Pegg and Frost; always genius off-beat comedy,7,9 December 2012,"I'm a fan of Simon Pegg and Nick Frost, they have great chemistry (as best friends in real life), hilarious sense of humour and some really off-beat ideas. This is no different. Paul is an alien who the two boys meet on a geek-pilgrimage to America's Comic-Con and Area 51 and the alien-sighting parts of Nevada. Their paths cross and they find that not only are aliens real and they've met one - big shock - but they might be able to help him out. They are surprised to find Paul so rude, crude, obnoxious, irreverent and funny but he just wants to go home and seems to have someone trying to get him back into a government facility. It becomes a road-trip, and a bit of a bromance too. The film has some things to say about science and religion - is a bit mocking - and most of the humour is bawdy and pretty gross! Viewers with sensibilities and aversions to sexual innuendo, drugs, nudity (albeit alien) and bad language should step away. Great supporting cast including Jason Bateman, Sigourney Weaver, Jane Lynch, Seth Rogan and Kristen Wiig.This is another Pegg/Frost pretty original hit; Madness, mayhem, humour and also wall to wall sci-fi in-jokes, homages and references to many other science fiction classics and if you are aware of this extra layer the film is infinitely worth more than a sum of it's parts.",Paul

Seth Rogen provides one of the most engaging vocal performances for Paul; he's such a good character that he becomes just another one of the guys; incredible special effects team! Written by Pegg and Frost also, the bromance is naturally amazing between them and very sweet natured, they genuinely share a passion for science fiction together making for the best part of the film in my opinion. The supporting cast are very funny too and director Greg Mottola (Superbad, Adventureland) manages to combine the crude humour with the softer pretty well. Sweet soundtrack too; ELO anyone?",Paul
107,jayjaycee,"For nerds, by nerds",6,17 January 2021,"""Paul"" is a 2011 adventure comedy directed by Greg Mottola starring Simon Pegg and Nick Frost.
⚪
All in all, this collaboration of American and British comedy geniuses takes you on an intergalactic fun trip by living out a true nerd fantasy and paying homage to classic features of modern pop culture, like science fiction and road trip films, and even if the humour might be a little too vulgar and off the road at times, it still manages to display the typical dry wit of the writers, and in the end, the likeable characters, the messy yet insane plot and a certain type of self-awareness answer the never asked question of what would happen if you interbreed ""E.T. - The Extra-terrestrial"" and ""Bonnie and Clyde"".

This film and I share an actually hilarious story, and I am going to tell you why: A few years back, I was on skiing vacation with my school, and the bus ride lasted for like almost fifteen hours. So, on the return trip, a classmate decided to pitch the idea to watch a movie via the entertainment centre of the bus, and since he expected the teachers to say yes, he suggested a movie that he ""coincidentally"" has taken with him. It was rated 12 and it didn't look quite inappropriate for my teachers, and thus they agreed to the idea. What made this experience this great wasn't just that the film turned out to be comparatively funny (I was thirteen back then), but also the horrified reactions of my teachers who didn't expect at all that it was going to feature such coarse language. Like, every time a character said something raunchy, the educators were totally embarrassed. So, this film has held a special place in my memories for bringing this kind of pleasure to a young teenager, and after all this time, I knew I had to revisit at least once. Even though I (expectedly) didn't hype it as I did back then, I still got to say that I have had a few laughs. What nowadays astonishes me most is the cast, as it assembles some of the most prominent comedians of the US and Great Britain. Next to frequent Edgar Wright collaborators and stars of the legendary ""Blood & Ice Cream"" trilogy, Simon Pegg and Nick Frost, almost playing themselves and being the screenwriters, we have many other known names like Kristen Wiig as a fanatic religious, Jason Bateman, Bill Hader and Joe Lo Truglio as the secret agents and last but not least Seth Rogen himself as the voice of the titular alien. Also the fact that it is directed by Greg Mottola, the dude responsible for my all time favourite high school comedy ""Superbad"", makes me feel like that indeed the comedy elite of the 2010s of American and British film have congregated to make the ultimate comedy film - at least in theory. As phenomenal and promising as it all might sound, it unfortunately failed to reach its full potential, and it is almost frustrating. Despite being self-aware of its own silliness, the film once too often loses its way in terms of humour. Undeniably, Pegg and Frost lived out their nerd fantasies and it is full of pop culture references, inside jokes and fan service, but on the other hand, there are way too many scenes that rely too much on profanity. Yes, for almost every witty conversation and line there is also a scene that tries to make you laugh with swear words and vulgarity only - and I don't think that Pegg and Frost are in need of this. Of course, language has been a tool in their previous projects, but what bothers me here is that it is used too excessively. I mean, the character Ruth is constantly swearing after her faith in god has been shattered, and it is anything but hilarious, quite the contrary, it is infantile. Other than that, the characters are likable as per usual and (despite slightly outdated CGI), the chemistry with the animated alien is surprisingly well conceptualised. With the two main nerds, he boozes, smokes joints and parties, and it was also hilarious to see the endless references to classic films like ""Close Encounters"", ""E.T."" and ""The X Files"" (that are apparently based on Paul's ideas), and this type of pleasant atmosphere makes up for the unnecessary language. In the end, the film is a love letter for nerds by nerds, and even if the humour is a hit or miss, I can still say that I had a lot of fun with it. Not the best comedy, but an enjoyable, nevertheless.",Paul

109,GeorgeRoots,A Love Letter To All Things Spielberg.,7,10 September 2014,"""Paul"", is one really funny movie that offers a little more substance without riding on the successes Simon Pegg & Nick Frost had gained in Edgar Wright's ""Three Flavours Cornetto"" trilogy. Being a huge lover of pop-culture, this film has a lot of it and it all gets surprisingly recycled into something both unique and familiar.Every actor is pretty much suited for their role, and I was really impressed how well Seth Rogen fleshed out as Paul. I was sceptical that it would just be Rogen spitting out his clever rude humour all the time, but when I saw him he was so hilariously offensive as well as going from loud to quiet, to rude but caring. It really made the Alien ""down to earth"", and ultimately a cameo from one of Sci-Fi's famous ladies makes this movie so fun to watch.Final Verdict: If you ever wondered what a road trip with an Alien might be like, then wonder no more. 7/10.",Paul
110,Meven_Stoffat,E.T. and Hot Fuzz had a baby and its head popped off!,9,22 February 2011,"As of writing, this film isn't out in Canada, however a CAM version of the UK release is out, so I am reviewing it based on the version I saw.When it comes to Brit comedy, nobody does it quite like the Frost/Pegg duo. Both are phenomenal actors and seeing them on screen is a charm. So when I saw the trailer for ""Paul"" with The Green Hornet,, I must say I was very excited. And I must say, the film didn't disappoint. Is it quite on the same level as the Blood and Ice Cream movies? Definitely not, but it's a great piece of brain popcorn and I believe you will definitely love it.This movie is basically the plot of E.T. with the humour of Hot Fuzz and Shaun of the Dead, and it works! Of course you can't go wrong with that combination. Although Edgar Wright didn't direct the film, and the film feels very different from the mentioned two, this film actually manages to have the same level of charm and entertainment as those two. Also, the film has a wide range of good actors- including Jason Bateman, Jane Lynch, and even David Koechner! Two British nerds, Graeme and Clive, are on a road trip across the US, which they have been dreaming of as kids. They've been dreaming of this as kids, and the highlight so far has been Comic Con San Diego. They even have met Adam Shadowchild. One night, while in Area 51, Nevada, they witness a car crash, and come across the foul-mouthed alien slacker Paul. But this ain't no District 9 or E.T. Paul is, as mentioned above, is a slacker, and a loud/foul mouth. He is being chased by US government agents, and Graeme and Clive have no choice but to take them with him. Along the way, they pick up a religious chick, an old lady who was wronged by Paul, and it all becomes one wacky and zany adventure.This is definitely an adults-only version of E.T., and one that manages to entertain all the way through. Tonnes of gross moments and WTF moments as well as belly laughs and crude humour. Seth Rogen is surprisingly great as the said alien Paul, his voice is surprisingly fitting. He was great in his past year's The Green Hornet, and he does amazingly well here. Pegg and Frost are their usual charming selves, and manage to make a great team. But the highlight of the movie was Kristen Wiig- she was HILARIOUS!!!! Every line from her mouth was gold, and she definitely stole the show. This movie also had lots of heart too, and there is a VERY touching scene near the end I will not spoil.Overall, this definitely is not Wright material, but if you go into it with an open mind, you will enjoy this movie like I did. Definitely recommended for sure.",Paul
111,Donatien3,Absolutely excellent!,10,18 April 2011,"With a steady stream of reboots, remakes, sequels and adaptations, it's refreshing to see a film with some original ideas for a change. It's no surprise that the men behind 'Paul' are Simon Pegg and Nick Frost, who created the hilarious 'Shaun of the Dead' and 'Hot Fuzz'.Pegg and Frost (who wrote the film) star as two British who take a long-awaited trip to San Diego for the Comic Con festival, followed by a road trip to famous alien landmarks (Nevada, Roswell etc). On their way across the country, they encounter an alien named Paul (voiced by Seth Rogen, who does his usual slacker routine and wins back some brownie points after the disappointing 'The Green Hornet'), who – having been used by the government for knowledge (including advising Steven Spielberg on 'E.T') – has outlived his usefulness and is looking to get back home . While this film can be enjoyed by a wide audience (though with plenty of coarse language, it's not really suitable for kids) sci-fi fans will get a real kick out of this, as there are a number of references to sci-fi movies, both famous and obscure. Not surprisingly, 'Paul' is very well-written, with some nice set-ups that pay off later in the film.The film is bolstered by a well-known cast of comedic actors: Kirsten Wigg, Jason Bateman, Bill Hader, Jane Lynch,Sigourney Weaver, David Koechner and 'Arrested Development's' Geoffrey Tambor. Like all classic comedies,'Paul' maintains the laughs until the end, with plenty of Pegg and Frost's subtle British humour as well as some genuinely sweet moments without being schmaltzy.It's hard to say whether 'Paul' is better than SOTD or 'Hot Fuzz', as fans will have their own personal favourites, but 'Paul' is easily the best comedy of 2011.",Paul
112,dommercaldi,The Film Was Nowhere Near As Good As I Remembered,3,27 March 2021,"Pros:
1. Simon Pegg (Graeme Willy), Nick Frost (Clive Gollings) and Seth Rogen (Paul) have electric chemistry together, and it's this which breathes most of the life into the film.2. Some of the jokes do induce a chuckle here-and-there.3. The special effects are well done to the extent that Paul doesn't look out-of-place in the movie at all.4. The soundtrack is not only fun and upbeat, but with the addition of Electric Light Orchestra, it also has a suitable futuristic feel.Cons:
1. The blatantly ominous violin playing and trumpet blowing is wholly overbearing and unnecessary.2. It's exceedingly hard to take the villains of Haggard (Bill Hader), O'Reilly (Joe Lo Truglio) and Moses Buggs (John Carroll Lynch) seriously as they're treated as mere comedic relief for the most part.3. Jason Bateman (Agent Zoil) delivers a generic Jason Bateman performance. He's not helped by his stale character.4. There are a couple lazy plot devices to set-up later drama that doesn't need to occur: A) Paul didn't need to expose himself to Ruth Buggs (Kristen Wiig). B) The radio in Haggard's car bizarrely allows him to broadcast 'secret' messages between Agent Zoil and The Big Guy (Sigourney Weaver). Surely an organisation that prides itself on secrecy wouldn't make such a rudimentary error?5. Most of the humour revolves around basic crudeness that is overused and unfunny, particularly the constant gag of Ruth Buggs emitting curse words.6. There is distracting usage of stock action music and movie screams that adds nothing to the film.7. The cameo of Sigourney Weaver is entirely distracting, especially as she is shoved in right at the end. When she's onscreen it's difficult to be immersed in the movie.8. The romance between Ruth Buggs and Graeme Willy is poorly fleshed-out and ham-fisted so it never feels genuine.9. The movie needlessly, and constantly, bashes Christianity and it becomes obnoxious and boring after awhile.",Paul
113,Ryan_MYeah,"Ignore the sub-par advertisements, the movie is funny and thoughtful.",8,30 March 2011,"Today I'm reviewing Paul, a movie from the comedic duo of Simon Pegg and Nick Frost, and from director Greg Mottola that I saw over the weekend.In the film, Pegg and Frost play Graeme and Clive, two British comics, Sci-Fi and UFO enthusiasts who decide that after a visit to Comic Con, have a road trip to see America's UFO hot spots. But while on their trip, come across an alien named Paul (Voiced by the exceptionally casted Seth Rogen), who - after years of living in captivity on Earth - has developed bad human habits of swearing, smoking, and making crude sexual humor. Graeme and Clive take Paul with them in their RV, and take a journey to get him home.I must confess that before I saw the film, I thought it was going to be terrible. This just turned into one of those instances where I was happy to be proved wrong. Aside from a terrific cast that includes not only Pegg, Frost, and Rogen, along with Kristen Wiig, Jason Batemen, and Bill Hader, What I most appreciate about the film is the screenplay.Like previous tributes like Shaun of the Dead to zombie films, and Hot Fuzz to fast paced action movies, Paul is an affectionate homage to classic 80's features, most notably the style of vintage Spielberg. There's also humorous references peppered throughout to the Star Wars and Witch Mountain series. I feel that this is gonna go down as one of the year's funniest movies. But aside from creative heart, and sharp wit, the film also has some deep ideas below the surface. The film makes obvious commentary on the theories of creationism and evolution, and in certain aspects, flies right in the face of the beliefs of Christianity.There's only one huge fault I can find about Paul.. the fact that Greg Mottola NEEDS TO FIND A NEW ADVERTISING TEAM! The ads are the exact reason I thought the film would be bad, and that's the same kind of misfortune that left his previous movie Adventureland (Also a good movie) tragically misunderstood and under seen. After these two movies, it's clear he has an affinity for 80's movie making stylistics, and I'm happy that he's found his personal stamp.My advice, just take a chance and hope you enjoy the ride. I give Paul *** out of ****",Paul

115,PipAndSqueak,Affectionate sci-fi trash,7,3 March 2011,"Paul is the name of a dog who, one assumes, the Alien originally rescued but then disposed of. This only occurs to you after thinking about why some things just don't seem to match up when you watch this film for the first time. There are other conceits that probably fly straight over the audience's heads too. Never mind, this is a healthily funny take on sci-fi and the people who love the genre. It takes a number of affectionate sideswipes at the icons well known to all of us. It reminded me of the live mime show based on the puppet series created by Gerry Anderson, ""Thunderbirds"". Funny because you can't really take some fictions seriously can you? A great laugh, just unfortunate that the writing wasn't given to a professional screenwriter to provide rude dialogue without so much need for expletives.",Paul
116,D_Burke,Are There More Aliens I Could Have A Beer With?,7,21 March 2011,"""Paul"" is a good combination of a few popular genres and subgenres, all of which get a welcome 21st-Century comedy makeover. The film looks like a kids film similar to ""Alvin and the Chipmunks"" (2007) and ""Yogi Bear"" (2010) in that a CGI-animated character is interacting with live action actors, but it has the funny adult elements of comedies like ""Shaun of the Dead"" (2004), ""Superbad"" (2007), and ""Pineapple Express"" (2008) that make it more memorable. The science fiction aspects of this film are obvious, and there are subtle nods to classics like ""Star Wars"" (1977), ""Alien"" (1979), and ""E.T."" (1982). Oh yeah, it can also be considered a road trip movie.All these elements combine to form a solid movie that has some laugh-out-loud hilarious moments. Also, while Seth Rogen has done cartoon character voices before in family films that were good, but not great (""Horton Hears A Who"" (2008), ""Monsters Vs. Aliens"" (2009)), it's probably the R-rated freedom from his best comedies that really makes his character shine in this movie.Seth Rogen's character is Paul, and he's an alien who crash landed in Nevada in 1947 and has remained around Area 51 ever since. You're told (not shown) that Paul has been examined and heavily questioned by both U.S. Government officials and Hollywood writers and directors. ""Agent Mulder was my idea!"" is one of his claims at one point in the movie.Paul doesn't appear in the movie until about 10 minutes in, when British sci-fi geeks and writers Graeme Willy and Clive Gollings (Simon Pegg & Nick Frost respectively, who also co-wrote the film) happen upon him outside Area 51 as they make a cross-country trip in an R.V. exploring America's alleged alien sighting hot spots. And yes, Roswell, New Mexico was on their agenda. Now that they came across Paul, who is being hunted by government officials who hope to kill him, their vacation plans change.The story here really needed more work, and there were times where the pacing of the film dragged. I liked how the film focused on Graeme and Clive at first. Somehow, British slackers feeling like fish out of water in America seemed to fit this film appropriately.What the story needed more of was Paul himself, since the movie was named after him. Most of Paul's background came from the mouth of the alien himself, but the film desperately needed some flashbacks. For instance, it never made sense to me why the government wanted to kill this alien. There was something mentioned by Paul about stem cell research, but there had to be more to the story than that. If this alien stayed on Earth for more than 60 years, why kill him now? I mean, couldn't he serve some purpose of some kind, especially for NASA? I also really wanted to know how he got the name Paul. It's such an ordinary name for an extraordinary being, and it is never explained anywhere in the film how he was named or even why.However, what this movie lacks in story, it makes up for in really appealing characters. Simon Pegg and Nick Frost work excellently off of each other, and Seth Rogen takes the alien character and makes him his own. Rogen also has some incredibly funny lines.I also really liked Kristen Wiig as Ruth Buggs, an isolated camp ground attendee with an overbearing father, a problem with her left eye, and a stubborn belief in intelligent design that is shaken when she sees Paul. Wiig really took a character that could have been a forgettable love interest object for one of the main characters, and added some real humor and heart to her. It's especially funny when she wears a shirt that depicts a cartoon Jesus shooting Charles Darwin through the head, and a caption that reads ""EVOLVE THIS"". She also has many really funny lines, like when she awkwardly tries swearing for the first few times.So while ""Paul"" takes all its inspiration from all the right places, and has some very funny lines, there should have been more to Paul's background that should have been revealed earlier in the film and using a few flashbacks. Still, Seth Rogen made Paul such an appealing character that you do care about him, and the plot manages to stay original. Parents may be in for a surprise if they bring their kids to see this film. After all, you would never hear Yogi Bear tell a human that he's ""speaking f**king English"".",Paul
117,doorsscorpywag,ooh Marmite!,9,6 June 2011,"Pegg and Frost were excellent in Hot Fuzz which made up for a slightly disappointing Shaun Of The Dead but was not sure what to expect from Paul. Thankfully his genius funny response to the anal probe joke assured we were on to a winner. A completely hilarious and insane Brit romp through sci-fi history with a surprise you may not expect awaiting for you at the climax. In between the two comic book nerds have the adventure of a lifetime, meet an alien, a one eyed Christian babe, some less than friendly locals, the Men in Black and discover the truth about the X Files and Steven Spielberg. A really competent supporting cast and an utterly delightful turn from Seth Rogen as the little green man ensure it is truly a hell of a funny ride as they try to get ET home. One for the records books again for the Dynamic Duo.",Paul
118,rlaine,"Edgar, where art thou",5,18 December 2011,"I've been a long time fan of Pegg/Frost/Wright stuff, ever since Spaced came out. On the flipside, I don't like most of the movies that the Apatow crew is putting out, altho Superbad was among the better ones and Adventureland wasn't that bad either.The premise with Paul is great if you forget who's directing it. It's got all the ingredients. Geeks and nerds, sci-fi, road movie, Pegg and Frost, cameos, good budget. And it is pretty good at times, but still I can't help but feel that it was a missed opportunity.So what's wrong with it? It's made for (American) teens, there's way too many gay and anal jokes. They also had to include marijuana, which is something very American and I can't understand why it's in every single movie these days. Then there's straight up bashing of Christianity, the unnecessarily bloody scene in the end. I can't help but feel that the script has gone through a treatment after Pegg and Frost have written it, since none of the earlier Pegg/Wright movies had these elements. Sure, Shaun of the Dead was bloody, but that was the whole point of the movie.I also had a problem with the casting. For some reason I haven't gotten used to the actors and actresses Apatow uses all the time. The character who Wiig is playing would have been so much better if cast with someone without her comedic background.Bottom line is that I think it's dumb to make a movie with teeny jokes with actors who are already going on 40. And it's not the whole movie that sucks, I just feel they should've cut some of the jokes out and replaced them with some real substance. Wright and Pegg showed in Shaun of the Dead that they're capable of creating comedy, horror AND drama, but this lacks the drama completely.I also recently watched Wrights Hollywood entry Scott Pilgrim. I think he succeeds much better, that movie has a heart. It's clearly aimed at a younger audience, but it's still much smarter. The movie had a much better casting too, with much more realistic characters.",Paul
119,theinaniloquent,"""Only girls phone home""",7,24 November 2011,"Two British comic-book geeks traveling across the U.S. encounter an alien outside Area 51.Simon Pegg and Nick Frost. These two played in the buddy-cop film Hot Fuzz. It was funny, crude, and ultra-violent. They debuted in the zombie romantic comedy (yeah) Shaun of the Dead. It was sweet, witty, and bloody. Then in 2011, they play two comic-book geeks who encounter an alien and travel with him to avoid the U.S government. While the premise sounds pretty cool (especially with the combination of Simon and Nick, again) we have more to expect. We have the voice of Seth Rogan (who I happen to be a big fan of) and a simplistic premise that involves sci-fi nods and the comedic moments of their previous work. So I had expectations... And I got exactly what I wanted. While Paul is definitely not their best work, it still delivers the same subtle formula of their other works. We have a fantastic set of characters: the two geeks, an religiously set-off woman that randomly cusses, a great set of cops (Jason Bateman, Bill Hader), a pot smoking alien, and a cameo by Sigourney Weaver. With all this said, I was clearly enjoying myself and there wasn't any dull scenes. Of course, the film had it's flaws. It wasn't the best of them and some scenes seemed to be a little to far-fetched. Nevertheless, I still sat back and enjoyed myself ignoring these tad mistakes. I loved how (for all you sci-fi film fans) there was subtle nods to all the movies. Some were obscured while others were in your face. The movie was filled with them, and you guys will be satisfied. To finish this review, I must also act upon the special effects. Although the movie wasn't action-packed and visually-packed, Paul looked real and his facial expressions were brilliant. With this, we can clearly see more technology around the corner. I highly recommend this film! For you, you, and you. Expect you, the critic who takes stuff to seriously. 7/10.",Paul
120,paudie,"Not as funny as ""Shaun of the Dead"" or ""Hot Fuzz""",7,25 February 2011,"It is inevitable that Simon Pegg and Nick Frost's latest film is going to be compared to their first two movies and unfortunately it comes up short.The plot premise is good. Two British sci-fi nerds are travelling around the US visiting sites associated with alien contact (Area 51 among others). Along the way they meet Paul, a worldly wise alien who has been on earth for years but now wants to return to his home planet. After their initial shock they agree to help him. However the US government, who have been getting scientific information from him since he arrived in the 1950's, is chasing him.They meet a few interesting characters along the way, such as a fundamentalist Christian (Kirsten Wiig), whose faith is put by the test by her close encounter with an alien! The last two thirds of the movie is a fairly standard chase movie with chase scenes and near encounters with Paul's pursuers. The ending is predictable and a bit corny.The acting is good. Seth Rogen is ideal as the voice of the laid back alien. Pegg and Frost do their thing as the nerdy tourists. Wiig does the best she can as the token female character. There are also a few cameos from familiar faces.however the script doesn't deliver on the original premise. There aren't enough really funny lines or situations. Through Wiig's character the movie throws a few unsubtle barbs at the US Christian right.

123,colinrgeorge,Innocuous Extraterrestrial Fun,6,28 March 2011,"""Paul"" is innocuous extraterrestrial fun, but should have been funnier given the caliber of its cast and crew. Simon Pegg and Nick Frost, the British bosom buddies who previously collaborated with Edgar Wright on genre send-ups ""Shaun of the Dead"" and ""Hot Fuzz,"" pen their first screenplay, which lovingly pays tribute to a half century of science fiction movie-making.The target audience for ""Paul"" is old enough to appreciate an homage to ""Close Encounters of the Third Kind"" and will recognize odd dialogue torn from ""Star Wars"" and ""Aliens,"" and yet much of the humor skews juvenile. For every gallon drawn from the cultural lexicon, there is a runoff of infantile attempts at comedy—Kristen Wiig as a Jesus Freak spouting tin-eared strings of mismatched expletives is one of the worst offenders.Thankfully, with a brisk pace and a stacked cast—bit parts are filled by greats like Jeffrey Tambour and Jane Lynch—the momentum rarely falters. Pegg and Frost play the leads, a pair of English geeks on holiday to Comic-Con, one RV rental away from a tour of America's kitschiest UFO tourist traps. While on an otherwise deserted stretch of moonlit highway however, they witness an epic car crash and meet the genuine article—an E.T. colloquially called Paul, voiced by comedian Seth Rogen. Less sci-fi parody than offbeat road film, the trio become fast friends on the lam from Paul's governmental pursuers. Jason Bateman of ""Arrested Development"" fame makes a convincing turn as a badass man in black.And yet for all the talent on board, ""Paul"" is short on funny. It's an easy hour and forty minutes, but the laugh out loud moments are few and far between. In addition to being the weakest Pegg/Frost flick, ""Paul"" is an equally underwhelming effort from director Greg Mottola, who previously helmed the hilarious high school comedy ""Superbad"" and the surprisingly poignant self-authored ""Adventureland."" Mottola brings a visual acuity to the proceedings, including an earnest prologue that recalls the Spielbergian charm of yesteryear, but such stylistic flourishes are ultimately abandoned in favor of conventional comedy over- lighting.""Paul"" never really feels like Mottola's film. He does manage to elevate Frost and Pegg's material from a directorial standpoint, but too often it's all too apparent that the authors are but fledgling storytellers. Occasionally, their lack of traditional screen writing experience works to their advantage, and their offbeat sensibility is part of what makes the film endearing in spite of its flaws. Rather than embrace their status as Hollywood outsiders however, Frost and Pegg attempt to emulate American studio output. The result is an unusual comedy worth seeking out, but one with a serious identity crisis on its hands.Hit and miss high jinks and bipolarity aside, Frost, Pegg, and Mottola are having too good a time to harp incessantly on where they went wrong. Gifted creatives all, even their lesser successes are more amusing and original that the lion's share of their competition. Science fiction diehards should be especially satisfied with ""Paul,"" which taps the nostalgia spigot for all it's worth with a plethora of in-jokes and surprises. The film may not rival the early work of any of the constituent creators, but it's still worthy of their legacy. It's just hard not to wish this extraterrestrial outing was more, well, extraordinary.",Paul
124,pontram,Could be Disneys new family line,6,17 June 2011,"Aliens with a big mouth and some habits are not quite new, and also various troubles to hide them from the world. I remember Alf (TV-Series 1987-1990), where most of the possible situations of an Alien stranded on earth were anticipated. Alf as a TV show was a big success, and now, more than 20 years later, the jokes and situations and troubles are quite the same, only the cgi is much better. And yes, there is much more action, like in the common flee-from-the-bad-guys-movies, where here in this comedy the bad guys are extremely stupid and this should cause some laughs, but it didn't because it's all done and seen in other comedies all the same. The buddy theme isn't that new at all, we have two nerds from UK who are often mistaken as gay, while they are only friends. While 'Paul' is executed well in terms of acting, cgi, cinematography, cut and pacing, it lacks on anything new and really funny. Even Alien Paul's various special abilities, his long history as a prisoner in Area 51 and his influences in popular culture ('Agent Moulder was my idea!') can't change that. I detected only one remarkable scene, where Paul revives a little bird, and what happens then. What I found somewhere likable is the portrayal of extreme and misled religiosity, anti-Darwinism, but it's of course shown only as an outsider's or hillbillies phenomenon, and not this growing community in North America. Also positive is an unexpected (but unfortunately not so convincing) story twist in the movie's finale. 'Paul' is a nice Disney-like and harmless adventure for teens, not too bad for their parents, suitable to fill a rainy afternoon with some mild fun and action.",Paul
125,blacklist-1,"Watchable entertaining fun from the Pegg & Frost team, but ultimately disappointing and very forgettable.",5,21 February 2011,"So Simon Pegg and Nick Frost team up for the third time to dish up another comic fun fest (or so I thought) after the great Shaun of the Dead and the hilarious Hot Fuzz. I have always in particular liked Simon Pegg in Run Fatboy Run, How to Lose Friends and Alienate People and he was the best thing doing the voice-over of the memorable animation character Buck in Ice Age 3: Dawn of the Dinosaurs, so I am a fan of his, but I'm afraid Paul is his poorest film yet.Don't get me wrong I did enjoy it enough to the end, there were some great gags and me laughing and chuckling enough to the end. Frost and Pegg still have that comfortable comic chemistry and they acted well. Seth Rogen as Paul was reasonable with terrific CGI and Jason Bateman gave a solid supporting performance with Sigourney Weaver who you don't actually see properly to the end of the film is terrific in her speaking scenes and when you actually see her. Unfortunately Kristen Wiig as Ruth wasn't really that good and the script is poorly written with little wit or sharpness. Many of the gags I've seen before making it predictable and too many of them misfire as some were just too crude to be funny (though I don't mind some crudeness) the characters as a result, mainly Paul aren't really that likable as jokes about urine and penises came up (which I hate). Also the constant gags about a three breasted women and Frost and Pegg's characters being gay were repetitive and did become a bit tiresome. There are a couple of scenes of surprising sweetness, but it just wasn't enough to counterbalance the crudeness. The screenplay is essentially a mess, with huge plot holes, which I wouldn't have minded had it been funnier. But it would be unfair to criticise this too much as it entertained me to the end and I never got too bored, but it isn't worth the cinema visit and really Pegg and Frost could and should have done much better than this, which left me quite disappointed. Saying that it's far from the worst comedy I've seen and it's worth a watch.",Paul
126,Bravesfan17,A fun adventure comedy for fans of comedy and sci-fi,8,18 March 2011,"This movie is lots of fun from the beginning to the credits. Simon Pegg and Nick Frost of Hot Fuzz fame wrote the screenplay and star as Graham and Clive, two sci-fi fanatics from England who come to the San Diego comic-con and plan a trip to American sites such as Area 51. While on the road in an RV, they are stopped after a car that has passed them crashes on the side of the road. In that car is an alien named Paul. After that, Graham and Clive on the road with Paul as they meet some interesting characters along the way.Pegg and Frost are both fun to watch on screen, as they have great chemistry between the two of them. They do fine jobs acting, but nearly everyone else around them does better jobs. I also think that Pegg and Frost did much better jobs at writing than acting.With their screenplay, Pegg and Frost know how to write hilarious scenes that focus on their characters. I also enjoyed how they put great references and homages to older sci-fi films like Star Wars, Close Encounters of the Third Kind, E.T., and Back to the Future. With their script, Pegg and Frost know how to make their references fit the film and give sci-fi fans something to laugh at.The first big standout to me is Jason Bateman as Agent Zoil, who works for the FBI. Zoil is sent by his boss to get Paul. However, Zoil has other plans as we find out later in the film. What Bateman does that makes is performance great is how he hides his secrets until the final scenes.Another standout is Kristen Wiig from Saturday Night Live as Ruth, who runs an RV campground with her ultra-religious father. What makes her performance funny and great is how she makes Ruth change after involuntarily going with Graham and Clive on their trip.Seth Rogen is typical Seth Rogen as he does the voice of Paul. It is nothing new from Rogen but he still does a passable job as the title character.Sigourney Weaver has a memorable cameo and hilarious brief role as Zoil's boss. When she is not on screen but her voice is heard, it is very believable as a mean boss. She is even more believable on screen as she is just a horrible boss.What makes it all funny is under the direction of Greg Mottola, who also directed Superbad. Mottola knows how to get the hilarious performances out of his actors, keep the story at a good pace, and keep the film entertaining and hilarious. Mottola makes this film a fun time at the movies.",Paul
127,calorne,Unfortunately Crass,4,29 September 2019,"I had high apple pie in the sky hopes for this movie. I really like the British leads and have enjoyed their other work. But I just didn't find it very funny. I laughed out loud once near the end at a play on words on a character's name, but apart from that I was watching thinking - "" you're better than this"". The main nerd characters appeared to have been directed to try to sound as much as possible like Ricky Gervais and that became tonally monotonous.It was attempted comedy by numbers rather than providing the audience with any genuine wit and that is such a shame given the brilliant humour that the leads have achieved with other projects.",Paul
128,RickHarvey,Boring for most parts,5,4 January 2012,"The first thing i should mention, out of politeness, is that Christian's will hate this film. OK, the majority of them will probably laugh ( will they? Not sure about the US types) and they should. Afterall, it is a comedy film not a factual documentary.Now, as a comedy film, there was no real big laughs to gain out of the experience. I giggled many times through out but nothing made me roll of my seat, heading throbbing with immense laughter. Seth Rogan as Paul was OK, with Paul being Seth's unrecognisable twin from another planet. Pegg and Frost were surprisingly boring whereas Bateman was the main standout.There wasn't enough to me make ever want to watch again. No big gags, simple jokes, repeated religion bashing. Good for a rental only. I can't say a lot. It was just Meh.",Paul
129,lois-lane33,A strange combination of ingredients makes a strange dish.,6,7 July 2015,Didn't want to see it when it came out. Eventually saw it out of boredom. Was impressed a bit-it wasn't such a bad film after all-but it did have its drawbacks. Primarily the fact that the alien was a CGI computer graphics image took away from the characters believability (!) and made you feel like a child believing in fairy tales after you watched it. The alien's character is entertaining-funny and smart at the same time. But its just a CGI generated image. Back to feeling like a silly kid again. Good ending but its just an alien done with a CGI computer graphics program. Back to...anyway-this film shows what I think is the first on screen pairing of Simon Pegg and his trusty sidekick & pal. They work well together. They went on to make a few more films which were better than this one-not that this one sucks or anything-as long as you don't mind feeling like a kid duped into feeling something for a CGI generated image. Ouch. Kind of like the recent Jurassic Park movie-as in hey they're not real dinosaurs-ah shucks. I was really stating to connect with them when they got together to kick the ass of...well thats another movie kids.,Paul
130,trans_mauro,Dull,1,9 June 2011,"Hummmmm....Let's see what is the take home message of this film: Be obnoxious, curse, smoke pot, be gay, bash Christianity, be a moron and then you become a cool human being... Wow!!!!First, I am not a Christian, in fact I am an atheist, but watching films like that ""PAUL"" one gets to the conclusion that those Hollywood liberal geniuses are cowards. The mock and make ridicule of Christians, but they do not have the guts to make fun of other religions and beliefs that can be way more dangerous and hateful than Christianity. For instance, would they have the courage to make fun of Muslims...? I guess not.Second, why this glamorization of profanity? Do they want to reduce the English language to a dialect based on four of 5 words all based on variations of the f... s... words? It looks like this is what they aim for.Third, the idea of the story was kind of OK, but its execution was poor. Lame jokes, and silly gags abound. I did not laugh, smile once while watching it. Yep, for something that was supposed to be a comedy, ""Paul"" lack any funny moments... It had potential, but it was wasted in poor script and less than an energetic direction.Fourth, Seth Rogen definitely sucks!Finally, Paul is one of the films one watches late in the night just to fall asleep in the middle of it. And in the next day, one does not care to know how it ended or even remember what it was about.",Paul
131,pswanson00,So frickin' funny,9,1 October 2019,"Yes, in parts it is a bit blasphemous, and Paul's rude and potty-mouthed, but I love this film. I've checked it out from my friendly local library 6 times in the last 18 months. Pegg and Frost are excellent as BritNerds, and Kristen Wiig is touching and believably hilarious. Paul is sufficiently realistic that I never had the thought ""Oh, he's computer-generated"" interrupt my enjoyment. There are many references to other movies, but the best one for me was when the group walked into a country bar where the band was playing the tune played by the space-creature band in Star Wars. I laugh right out loud every time I hear and see it.",Paul
132,thomvic,A great ride and shouldn't be taken too seriously,8,24 April 2011,"When you go into a movie starring buddies Simon Pegg and Nick Frost (Shaun of the Dead and Hot Fuzz) you know what to expect with their type of films.And who's really complaining? I'm sure not going to. Paul is nothing very original, nor is it an unpredictable story but it's a comedy that takes you on the ride and makes you have a good time while you're there. Contrasting two British actors amongst the weirdness of desert like America (supposedly near Area 51) is a great setting.Simon and Nick play two comic book obsessed geeks who make their way to a comic book convention in San Diego. On a road trip to visit the less touristy areas such as Area 51, Nevada etc, they encounter Paul, an alien who acts more human than most aliens who is on the run from agents and a mysterious woman who we only hear her voice. Paul is on a mission to get back to his spaceship away from 'The Big Guy' and hops on the two guys RV Van. Along the way ,they pick up religious, non swearing Ruth (Kristen Wiig) who is almost a Jennifer Anniston look alike in this movie. Their mission is to get Paul away from the bad guys back to his spaceship.Sounds silly doesn't it? That's because it is meant to be but it all works, probably because of the performances and the contrast of two characters who are in a very foreign land outside of Great Britain, where their comfort zone is. The landscape of America in this film looks great, with some nice cinematography that adds to the feel of a chase movie at the same time.The references to other alien films such as Close Encounters of the Third Kind. E.T and in a way Alien as well just make you laugh, especially if you understand it – luckily I did. However, it does feel sometimes that it needs to add these references in to get some more laughs from the audience – and while it does, some parts of the film feel very forced in humour. For example one scene where Paul poses as a prop in a souvenir store and one of the cops checks him out wanting to see an alien penis.Another theme it explores surprisingly is also one of religion, though is careful not to come to any strong conclusions on it. This is where Ruth's character comes in questioning her beliefs on gods, blasphemy, fornication etc. And I can see how for some people, this won't agree to everyone's liking but if you don't take it too seriously, then it shouldn't bother you too much.Nicely handled with some clever scripting makes this an enjoyable film that doesn't take itself seriously which is where it gets its charm. Watch out for a cameo appearance from Glee Star Jane Lynch as an owner of a café, while also making reference to her sexuality in the end credits.",Paul
133,metalrox_2000,Funny buddy film with a twist.,10,4 May 2012,"It is hard to figure out where to start as to why this film works on so many levels.The movie opens as a young girl witnesses an UFO crash on her front lawn, in the process, squishing her dog Paul to death. We next catch up with Graeme (Simon Pegg) and Clive (Nick Frost) as two sci-fi fans who've come to America on holiday. After a less then friendly meeting with their idol, a writer named Adam Shawdowchild, the two friends begin to check out the many sights, running into some unfriendly hillbillies along the way. While trying to escape them, they witness a car crash. The driver is an alien named Paul, trying to get to a point where he is to meet the mother ship.What happens is a buddy road trip film where Paul becomes friends with Clive, Graeme, and Ruth (Kristen Wiig, along for the ride after she and Paul get into an argument over the existence of God).Throw in FBI Agents (Jason Bateman, Bill Hader, and Joe lo Truglio) on Paul's trial, and a very bad government agent (played with zest by Sigourney Weaver), and you have quite a funny movie that works on all levels. Paul even attempts to connect with Tara, now a grown woman who's life was turned upside down after her encounter with Paul as a child.Paul is a movie that is funny, sentimental, creative, and at the same time, pays homage to sci-fi films like Star Wars, Aliens, and many other as it incorporates lines from those films into its own plot. The twist at the end works as well, as this movie is truly underrated. Yes, the humor may be crass at times, but there is also charm as well. A must see movie that is very underrated!",Paul
134,ihrtfilms,Could have been so much funnier,3,29 April 2011,"Graeme and Clive are best mates; they are also comic book nerds on a dream trip from England to the US and after attending a comic-con they head off on a road trip to see some famous alien sites. Their trip takes a surprising turn however when after a car accident they meet Paul, an alien. The pair help Paul who is trying to get back to his own planet after being held by the government. Along the way they pick up bible bashing Ruth who quickly becomes an alien believer and the foursome travel in an RV to the meeting point, all the while being chased by Federal Agents, Police and Ruth's dad most of whom want Paul dead.Simon Pegg and Nick Frost team up again here, but take things Stateside for the first time after the British set hits such as Shaun Of The Dead. Some of the previous films from these two are brilliantly funny and it's difficult not to go into this with high anticipation and it does start well, but As the film progressed, I realised I just wasn't really laughing. There are some nice moments in this and a few times I laughed out loud, but for the most part it felt rather lifeless and obvious jokes fell flat. All of which is a shame as not only is the premise a great one, but with a superb cast it should be fail proof, but this time Pegg and Frost don't pull it off well enough.Graeme and Clive are a lovable duo and Paul himself is fun even if being voiced by Seth Rogen seems a wrong choice and towards the end the film works better, but it all felt a little lifeless and judging by the reactions of other audience members, either 20 odd people don't have a sense of humour or this just isn't that funny.more of my reviews at my site iheartfilms.weebly.com",Paul

But it's not the type of comedy that's for everyone - if you enjoy stoner comedy mixed in with geeky awkward nerdy humour, then you will enjoy this. There is a lot of swearing and vulgarity, and it's certainly not an intelligent movie, but as I said - it's fun.There are a few surprising heartwarming moments too, which I won't mention here for spoilers.

I wish they would have spent more time at the Comic Con and nerded it up a little more. Their observations and humor were spot on. I thought Paul himself should have been a little more alien. He seemed like Seth Rogan but with a big purple head. He could have almost been any generic slacker dude. Pegg & Frost are a great team and Kristen Wiig was good in her part, as usual. I could actually see the three of them making another movie together.

This movie is very funny and has a decent story with good CGI (for 2011) but it feels really weak when compared to Simon Pegg's other movies. The jokes can get a bit repetitive and it feels very ""american"" compared to Shaun Of The Dead and Hot Fuzz (Mainly because Greg Mottola is directing) but it's just something that bothers me a little and nothing else. It's a fun movie, but unlike Kingsman and other fun movies it clearly lacks a creative spark.",Paul
139,valen060,Simon Pegg/Nick Frost Comedy Worth Some Laughs!,9,7 April 2011,"After a months worth of thinking up a good way to review this movie, I have to say ""INCREDIBLE!"" The plot about two British guys on a road trip in America to head to the famous San Diego Comic Con, but also coming across an ""I'm-On-Weed"" type alien (voiced by the great Seth Rogen) named Paul around the so-called Area 51, cracked me up and countless others in the theater at the same time! As a local of San Diego, California, I felt proud to see the filmmakers add the famous Comic-Con into their movie as the starting point for the two main characters and their yet-to-come hilarious adventures. For the rest of the film, it had several gags and scenarios that made it difficult for me to keep a straight face! ""Saturday Night Live's"" Bill Hader and Kristin Wiig delivered well in their performances, even Jason Bateman's character had his wits.To close, this British-American joint venture was well-written and seems to distance itself from the average road/stoner movie. Combining the talents of Simon Pegg, Nick Frost, and Seth Rogen balanced well with one another. Sure, Paul's backstory might have needed a small tweak in terms of detail (though I won't spoil what that is), but the various references to sci-fi movies (mostly ""E.T."") crossed with weed jokes and sexual gags (used commonly in Rogen's previous films like ""Knocked Up,"" ""Superbad,"" and ""Pineapple Express"") makes this movie unique in its own way.",Paul
140,thewillt08,A Swing and a Miss,4,11 August 2013,"Simon Pegg and Nick Frost came together once again, and this time they made Paul. Where to begin with this disaster? Seth Rogan is the voice of Paul, the alien, that's good. Nick Frost's character is named Clive, that's bad. Simon Pegg is not that funny and has a silly love interest with Christen Wiig, that's very bad. Bill Hader plays a bumbling idiot with a partner who is even worse, that was the nail in the coffin. Pegg and Frost are at Comic-Con and go on the road every nerd dreams of. On their way they run into Paul, an alien on the run trying to get home. UghI hope you enjoy WillyT rants because this is a good one. Shaun of the Dead and Hot Fuzz both got the WillyT Seal of Approval so I had high hopes and expectations going in. Edgar Wright was not involved with this movie so that is the biggest mistake. Simon Pegg helped Wright write the other two movies but Paul was written by Pegg and Frost. I'm sure Rogan improvised many of his line like he does to add his comedy, but the writing was poor in this movie. The story was weak and the plot twist at the end should have been a shock, but I couldn't have cared less. The characters were stupid other than the three main ones but even they were written poorly. I wanted this movie to be so much better and after seeing it for the third time I don't know if I ever want to see it again. Let's start with the characters. Simon Pegg is a funny guy and a fantastic writer but he intentionally writes himself as unfunny. The only funny part about his character is his name, Graeme Willy. Come on, that name is beyond stupid and the only thing worse is a name like Clive Gollings, but wait that's Nick Frost character's name. Good God if anything annoyed me more in this movie it was hearing their names. I get they are nerds but nerds have normal names. Their relationship is at least believable and the gag that the two of them are gay is funny throughout the movie. The both of them can act and be funny and while this wasn't their best performance they had their moments, just not many. The main source of the comedy came from Paul and Seth Rogan. Rogan is one of the funniest men in America and he does not disappoint as the role of Paul. The character Paul is the single ray of sunshine during the cloudy day. From the first scene to the end credits Paul is a riot. When he revives the bird, gives Spielberg the idea for ET, and especially the argument about evolution is all hysterical. I remember rolling in my seat in the theater a few years ago. The problem is that he doesn't share the spotlight. He is the only thing funny about the movie. Pegg is funny. Frost is very funny, but in this movie he is obnoxious and boring. Jason Bateman is also in this movie and he can be funny but he is written as a serious secret agent so he isn't supposed to be funny. Bateman was a miscast; he could have been in the movie but not as that character. This movie also has Christen Wiig and Bill Hader who are really good on SNL but I hate them in this movie. Hader is incredibly annoying and every time he and his dumb partner are on screen I feel like a four year old would only laugh at their comedy. They act like a child, which is the point, but I hate it. The scene where they play hide and seek is too silly to be funny. Their end result is very satisfying so touché to the writing on that one. I laughed because I hated the characters more than it was funny. Christen Wiig is probably the worst part of the entire movie. Her character is a God loving nutcase who has a lazy eye. The lazy eye was so unnecessary and I get why it was their but it wasn't needed. The eye is used for the final push so she believes that Paul is real and she questions God. Another major problem is that she believes strongly God for her entire life. She wears a funny shirt that says ""Evolve this"" or whatever it says and it has Jesus shooting Darwin in the face. I will say that was the only funny part of her character but I think it would have been funnier if they didn't mention it and left it as subtle comedy. Anyway, her beliefs are changed in three seconds and she no longer believes in God because Paul passes on his experiences and knowledge. That is wrong on so many levels. They can't straight up deny the existence of God. That is morally wrong in my opinion. I'm not a God fanatic but I do believe in God and the way they went about her character was wrong. I don't believe she would have taken a complete U- turn in thirty seconds. Overall, Paul was a huge disappointment. It was funny, I was laughing but it was stupid silly humor. The characters and story were so lame and poorly written. The childish humor would have been funny if I was under the age of ten and this movie is rated R so not many ten year olds will watch it. Christen Wiig has a lot of poop and fart jokes as she starts swearing and its hit and miss. Paul is an overall disaster but it has its funny moments so it gets the WillyT A For Effort. I wanted better and its honestly hard to sit through.",Paul
141,twilliams76,E.T. for grown-ups,6,13 July 2011,"Paul is E.T. for grown-ups. Stars Simon Pegg and Nick Frost have given us Shaun of the Dead (tribute to zombies) and Hot Fuzz (hilarious tribute to action shoot-em-ups) in the past; and now the duo gives us a tribute to science fiction with Paul.Much like their other films, Paul is both funny and mature but I think this is the least successful of the three. Paul is a foul-mouthed alien who landed on our planet 60 years ago. The film has its audience jump ahead 60 years and our story finds Paul trying to ""escape"" earth and return home to space -- yes ... as said, it is E.T. but with countless other film references.As the film needs a female in the plot, an eye-patch-wearing/ bespectacled Kristen Wiig (Bridesmaids, SNL) is picked up at a camping site along the way and partakes in most of the foul mouth joke-telling (Paul is rated R!!). Jason Bateman (Arrested Development, Up in the Air), Bill Hader (SNL, Superbad) and ""The Big Guy"" are all government agents hot on their trail of keeping the escaped Paul a secret.The film does have its fair share of laughs and it is apparent that Pegg and Frost love film (ALL of their film projects put this love on full-display). While Paul is heavy on the laughs, it also surprises with a few touching moments of human sentimentality -- and thanks are in order for Blythe Danner (Meet the Parents, Another Woman) for her role as Paul's first earth-born ""friend"".I believe Paul ended up running a bit too long and some of the jokes were overplayed -- not to mention the entire ""too many coincidences""-thing -- for the film to be great; but one can still enjoy it. It is a comic book love letter to sci-fi.",Paul

The cast is stacked with great comedy actors and that really makes this film fun, everyone seems to be really enjoying themselves and the performances really benefit from this. Simon Pegg and Nick Frost once's again work so well together on screen and their chemistry is just brilliant and this role for them really seems like they are just being themselves. Seth Rogan as Paul is also just brilliant casting as his voice and comedy is just perfect for this role. Although this is obviously not the best film by the great duo it is certainly enjoyable and that's all that matters in this film.

143,Amthermandes,"Funny, entertaining, worth while, just went too mainstream",6,7 January 2021,"Biggest complaint here is that it's Seth Rogan. He's a likeable actor, even though he's type-casted and can only play one type of role, this role just wasn't for him. The character of Paul would have worked so much better with someone else, probably someone lesser known. The voice just didn't fit the character and it is turns out to be distracting.Paul is a rude, crude anti-theistic extraterrestrial dude who is just trying to escape his duplicitous prison, and enlists the help of a couple nerds just trying to enjoy their vacation. It's funny, hilarious in moments, and it's got an engaging (and according to the female perspective: ""cute"") feel to it, a great ""popcorn"" comedy. Some secondary characters are a bit ridiculous, some jokes are off and try too hard. But overall it's a fun, enjoyable film that is good for most modern adults. And Simon Pegg and Nick Frost are just so great together, it's always a pleasure to see these two buddies work together on screen.Oh, and the NERD references are a'plenty. It's quite a nod of respect to Steven Spielberg and other nerd-esque references.It's worth watching, it's worth buying, but it's not worth being on anyone's top 100 list.And if you're religious, be warned, there is a fair amount of unapologetic atheistic philosophy that gets shoved down the audience's throat.",Paul
144,alrodbel,A profound bizarre film perfect for this moment in history - 2019,10,19 September 2019,"This is written during the election campaign that will either give a second term to President Trump or to one from his opposition Democratic party. It's location in the flow of history should be defined by eras, rather than number of years since the birth of Christ, that traditional count of cycles of our planet around the sun.The era of this film's creation and dissemination is a millisecond of cosmic time, from the great apes developing that first proto-culture, meaning complex interactions cemented by language -- that at one point, unexamined and unknowable, - ostracism, affection and curiosity resolved itself into something different - laughter.In this context, Paul, the alien possessing powers that are unknown to earth creatures, is appropriately reaching us through the medium that we humans are accustomed to. We can join other strangers in an auditorium and feel the kinship of the knowing group who laughs in unison, or it can be in our own home watching a screen that allows us to be part of that same crowd. The knowing laughter unites us for a few seconds as we let ourselves be part of the adventure.Paul wavers between vulnerability and immortality, his existence being only threatened by his extending himself by compassion, attempting to save another by the giving of his essence. If only there were such a creature, the personification of love who represents a force that transcends what earthian creatures and our cultures have devolved into. If only we humans had his compassion and ability, no longer needing to bury our fears in religious faith-- to join a stern patriarchy lead by a supernatural creature who demands fealty.Paul showed us how that it's possible with a single touch to a secret spot to transform a frightened human into one who feels the full pleasure of her body connecting with another. The sexual joy of the young woman transformed becomes more genuine than the oppression that she, and her culture, imposed.Paul the extra-terrestrial, and Paul the movie are messages from someplace that most of us may imagine, and some of us seek in various ways. For a couple of hours there was this gift of enlightened joy that seems to be receding as hatred, escalating and irrational, has taken over the political culture of our country and the world.Paul, thanks for the visit. Let's hope that your message somehow becomes part of this suffering planet.",Paul
145,jljacobi,"Great premise, fun, but a little off-balance",6,11 September 2015,"For the most part I enjoyed this movie, but it seemed a bit rushed and shallow. Perhaps, because the writers were too busy making fun of certain stereotypes and being socially political. Perhaps because, being residents of the U.K. they were caricaturing caricatures and trying a little bit too hard to dispel others. Maybe they were just having too much fun on their U.S. road trip.I also found too much of the acting overly hammy. Somebody has to play the straight man, but there's little of that. I could've used a little less toilet humor as well. As they actually say in the movie ""You have to pick your spots""All that aside, the basic tenor of the movie is pleasant because, I would guess, that there's a love of the subject matter. Also, it seems that the actors were having fun with the roles and making the movie. I've seen a lot worse, but with a bit more restraint, this movie could've been great.",Paul

I didn't know who was in it other than Pegg and Frost, so the appearance of some well known Hollywood superstars was a real treat.Some of it so obvious it becomes even funnier but I wonder whether some of the irony will be lost on a USA audience. The ""Paul"" character is superbly done and the human interaction is seamless.Well worth the West End prices we paid.",Paul
147,blackmambamark,One of those comedies you would prefer to watch on your couch after a night of heavy drinking,7,21 March 2011,"Like it or not, Alien movies are the hot ticket this year. ""Mars Needs Moms"", ""Battle: L.A"", ""Super 8"", and ""Area 51"". It only seems fitting that a comedic twist on the subject would surface. It happens almost every year, no matter the genre'. Whether it be a superhero flick, or a gangster movie, Hollywood always finds a way of providing a comedic point of view.Given the previous material that Simon Pegg and Nick Frost have given us with ""Shaun of the Dead"" and ""Hot Fuzz"", one can only expect greatness. Well....they are missing Edgar Wright as a director, which really does add a lot to the table. But i think Greg Mottola is a great fit. Seeing that his last directed comedy ""Superbad"", is one of the best comedies in the past 10 years. But even though the team behind this seems like it would be brilliant, it really doesn't have an edge to it like one would expect.The comedic portions of this picture are somewhat funny. I found myself mildly chuckling at every other turn, as opposed to laughing hysterically throughout the entire movie. The humor is good, but not great. You either have to be super stoned, or a mega nerd to understand where most of the comedic 'one-liner' dialog comes from. If neither of which applies to you, then it will probably be waaay over your head and you wont be laughing at anything. I however, like to consider myself a bit of a movie/comic geek, and I understood all of the funny references that they constantly make. But even though i fully grasped everything they were talking about, i still wasn't laughing my head off. It was more cute, than funny....if that makes any sense.However, i will say that the Christian community will be upset about this. I myself AM a Christian, but i was not offended. I get the jokes, and i don't put up a fuss about it. It's all in good fun. But the other radical 'i complain about everything' Christians, will be up in arms about a lot of it. But i do have one complaint. This movie had the potential to be REALLY funny if it wanted to. I think everyone in the theater could sense it as well. But instead of exploring all these possible elements of humor within the story, they decided to go the religious route. So in a way, i am offended by the religious material. Not as a Christian, but as a movie fan.Bottom Line.....By no means am i saying that this movie is bad. But then again, I'm not really saying this movie is good either. It falls right in between. It's really one of those comedies that you would enjoy on your couch on a Saturday morning after a night of heavy drinking. It's one of those nice comedies that requires you to not think that much......which is nice. But it's a very forgetful comedy piece.",Paul

The plot is familiar enough alien comes to earth and meets humans,two of the most stupid annoying fat nerds your ever likely to meet this side of a far scape convention.As with most of these one note movies i found myself waiting for the funny stuff to start happening until i was rudely surprised by the closing credits.I imagine it'll make 100s of billions of pounds this movie solely by virtue of it being utter dross and people have low to no standards,it doesn't look like pegg is in a hurry to change his most profitable formula",Paul
150,skullislandsurferdotcom,Close-Minded Encounter of the Nerd Kind,5,23 November 2011,"Oh if only our two geeky protagonists never ran into that stupid alien, voiced so humanlike by the always contented with his own lazy rhythm Seth Rogen that, instead of seeming like a real character, he's simply Seth Rogen voicing a computerized alien.The first twenty minutes is fantastic as a long-haired, overweight, fledgling science-fiction writer named Clive, and his laidback, balding sidekick Graeme both native Englanders visit Comic Con in Middle America and then venture in an RV to Area 51 to rekindle their nerdish origins.The entire purpose for the road trip is a honeymoon for geeks: renewing a marriage to science fiction, and the audience takes part. A few stops along the way, showing the non-dynamic duo at odds with rednecks, and going back and forth with each other like dudes who've known each other forever, are fun and natural.And then they find Paul (or vice versa), an escaped alien set up during the quick prologue – whose spaceship landed on a dog with the same name in the 1950s. This is where the real story begins and the movie, though wielding decent action-based chase scenes and introducing three likable yet villainous federal agents, goes to pot.Seth Rogen's not only the wrong person for the alien's voice, sounding like a long-lost fraternity brother farting, drinking, smoking, swearing, and railing against the only religion Hollywood's allowed to bag on but his forced, bitterly cocky aura takes away from the film's charming premise.And Kristen Wiig as a redneck religious fanatic, so cartoonishly exaggerated in her faith that she's begging to be talked out of it, adds more to the writer's blatant contempt for something he hasn't the patience to tolerate.Yet there are some cool nods to Lucas's STAR WARS and the films of Steven Spielberg, the latter making a special voice cameo. Perhaps he'd have made a better Paul!",Paul
151,clivy,"Cute, but not very satirical",6,20 February 2011,"My hubby and I were looking forward to seeing ""Paul"". We thought Shaun of the Dead and Hot Fuzz were hysterical (especially for the great performance of Elvis the Swan). We enjoyed ""Paul"" but we didn't find it as funny as Simon Pegg and Nick Frost's earlier films. We thought it was a gentle comedy, about right for a Sunday afternoon.The opening sequence at Comic Con in San Diego was a winner, full of sharp observation. Once it left the Comic Con, ""Paul"" developed very slowly. My hubby noticed that nobody in the audience laughed during the first twenty minutes.The special effects were very good: the CGI was impressive. It was easy to believe that Paul was another actor in the scenes. We enjoyed the references to classic sci fi films, like the band in the bar playing the song from the cantina in Star Wars. The reference to ""Mac and Me"" was especially funny; it's great to see a nod to obscure alien films as well as famous ones.We loved how ""Hot Fuzz"" lampooned the ""mystery in a small town"" plot, and how ""Shaun of the Dead"" poked fun at the conventions of zombie flicks. The alien of ""Paul"", like his appearance, really wasn't all that surprising. We've seen slacker aliens who swear and smoke pot before, like Roger in ""American Dad"". I liked how Paul spent his time on Earth advising the American government and contributing to science fiction films and TV shows. I also liked how Paul challenged the fundamentalist characters' beliefs about the universe. But Paul really didn't do much else that was unpredictable. It would have been much funnier and much more interesting if Paul presented another world view other than American, and other than Sci Fi Nerd.By the way, I am very tired of aliens landing on Earth speaking English. There was a commerical several years ago that had aliens landing speaking Swiss German. Why not? There have been UFO sightings all over the world: I'm skeptical that the U.S. (and Hollywood) owns aliens.",Paul
152,jafar-iqbal,"Typically brilliant, a great comedy",9,27 August 2013,"Two British sci-fi geeks road-tripping across America stumble upon what is quite possibly their wildest dream: an actual alien outside Area 51. The alien, Paul (Seth Rogen), is in fact a foul-mouthed, pot-smoking extra-terrestrial; they offer to help him find a way back home, all the while being chased by some shady government agents.It doesn't take much for me to get excited about a Pegg-Frost project; the two best friends have pretty much never disappointed, from their early sitcom days to their forays into cinema now. With 'Paul', however, they ventured into new territory by writing a screenplay together for the first time. The result? Another raging success.Whether it's taking the mick out of the fanboy world, or homaging classic science-fiction cinema, or even just with the simple road-trip humour, the entire film is handled with intelligence and aplomb. It's obvious that it's a story and a genre very close to Pegg and Frost's heart, and that shines through. As good as they are though, the MVP is Seth Rogen, without a doubt. He is just providing the voice for Paul, but does it with such brilliance. I couldn't imagine anyone doing a better job, the character seemed tailor-made for him. The supporting cast is good too, including a fantastic turn from Kristen Wiig as the ditzy love interest.If you've loved the stuff Simon Pegg and/or Nick Frost have done in the past, then you really are going to love this. If you're a sci-fi fan, you'll love it. If you like actors like Kristen Wiig, Bill Hader, Jason Bateman and Jeffrey Tambor doing what they do, you'll love it. Many reasons why you'll enjoy this movie, so go and enjoy it!",Paul
153,BJBatimdb,Better than expected,6,25 March 2011,"Going to a movie with low expectations is almost always the key to enjoyment. Having seen the appalling trailer (no pun intended but apt anyway)I was really not happy about being dragged to see Paul.I was pleasantly surprised that it was reasonably engaging, reasonably funny and had a reasonably interactive 'spot-the-Spielberg-reference' running gag.The language is unnecessarily four-lettered, which adds precisely nothing to a film which would otherwise do pretty well aimed at kids, but what do I care? I'm not an investor.Pegg and Frost are watchable enough to keep the whole thing ticking along nicely and although it's all quite tame and predictable, there are a few laugh-out-loud moments and plenty more smiles. Good ones from Pegg, who appears to have bowed to the Hollywood dental gods and had his teeth fixed. Bit of a shame - bad teeth can sometimes be the only way to recognise British actors.Not a patch on Sean of the Dead, but not as stupidly over-long as Hot Fuzz, and I'll probably pay to see these guys again.",Paul
154,Jona1988,Good fun but not on level with Shaun and Fuzz,6,27 February 2012,"I loved Hot Fuzz and also really liked Shaun of the dead. Still when I found out about Paul while it still was in development I could not quite get that excited. Paul is not directed by Edgar Wright who made Shaun and Fuzz so in that way one should not see it as a successor to them but still it stars and is also written by Nick Frost and Simon Pegg so one can't help but draw a little comparison.So did I like this movie or not? The answer is I did, when it ended I felt liked I've had a great time. It is also a great film to watch with a bunch of pals which is the kind of company I was in when I saw it. However the film didn't start out that well. At first it felt like it was going at like way to fast. So some films are fast paced and usually comedies like this kind but it is not that way, this felt rather rushed and forced. Same goes for the humour for like the first twenty minutes or so. The supposed to be funny scenes are forced upon you and over the top even for this kind of movie. But thankfully after a while stuff starts to happen in the plot more than just Pegg and Frost's characters running around being silly. The story might not be great stuff but rather basic having been done before stuff but that's exactly what this film is a hail to the science-fiction genre. A lot of the jokes are parodies on classic movie moments in the genre and for me it worked great. Of course one needs to have a bit of knowledge about the kind of movies but come on this is made for the sci-fi fans. There is also other kinds of jokes in this and once I get into the style of the film it is good fun even if it doesn't quite hit the perfect spot as their previous films and some stuff fall flat. The parody stuff is the main theme of the movie. Like I said the plot is not more than very well. It does what is needed but not more and the stories in Shaun and Fuzz were more than the average comedy stuff and actually brought something new and also managed to both surprise and entertain. Paul doesn't do that you know pretty soon what will happen because it is just forward familiar stuff. Never surprises' but always entertains, well most of the time at least. And so what about the effects one must ask when there is sci-fi in the title. There is a alien in the movie. Come on that's no spoiler as you can see it on like every poster. It looks good enough but of course it's not Gollum quality even if I've read that is was filmed in that kind of way. More than sometimes I get the feeling that he is not really there and it can look kind of 2D. Still this is a comedy and so should be judged by the fun and not the effects. The title character is voiced by Seth Rogen. That works good, sure you right away know it is him and even if you don't know his name you can picture him from just seeing a couple of movies with him. I think he fits the role fine with the perfect voice to get the right feel for the character and fitting to the tone of the film. Just his voice feels funny here and he hits the lines perfectly. There are some jokes making fun with religion which I have seen several point out. But I don't think one should be offended by it; I mean we can joke about all other things so why should religion be different. But that's just my opinion.To sum up: I liked Paul. It is clearly weaker than Pegg and Frost's Shaun of the dead and Hot Fuzz but that doesn't mean it's weak on its own. Neither was I disappointed when the movie ended but had had a fun time. So bring some friends over and see it cause it's that kind of movie.",Paul
155,Targe,Hilarious - if you liked Hot Fuzz and Shawn of the Dead,9,28 November 2011,"This movie should have been marketed as the third movie in the series after Shawn of the Dead and Hot Fuzz, because this is exactly what it is, or, to be more specific, Simon Pegg and Nick Frost do America the Roadtrip, with a UFO theme.If you love Sci-Fi, the movies above, and are not a die hard Christian, you will LOVE this movie, it is hilarious (obviously, I fit the categories) If you don't watch a lot of Sci-Fi you will think it's ho-hum OK.If you are a die-hard (do you call yourselves 'fundaMENTALists'?) you will be calling for Simon and Nick's heads on spikes. This movie is a brazen all out ASSAULT on Christianity, or to say it kinder and more pc, this movie kicks Jesus's arse all over the town.The concept of a universal God with interpretations on different planets by different species is, I guess, lost on these writers...That being said, if you can get past the above, the rest of the writing is fantastic, the fun fast and furious, and the lead alien, spoken by Seth Rogan, is well done.And Sigorney Weaver steals the show, as she does.",Paul
156,fullheadofsteam,"Clever in Sci-Fi references, bit of an E.T. ripoff",6,23 September 2013,"The comedy duo of Pegg & Frost is a very welcome modern version of some classic comic pairs, such as Abbott & Costello. Their first film, Shaun of the Dead, and follow-up Hot Fuzz cleverly combine classic horror-movie themes with a modern take. This movie does the same, with one glaring flaw, which is that the stars (Pegg & Frost), who are also the co-writers, have used the horror-comic platform to launch a diatribe against Christianity in general, which unfortunately only serves to spoil the fun. There are so many reverently amusing references to the most memorable sci-fi/alien movies as to be truly admirable, but then it devolves with grossly exaggerated and demeaning put-downs, sadly overgeneralized, of Christianity. Demeaning and unintelligent is the overall put-down of Christian belief in the misbegotten and obviously ignorant failure to understand that not not all Christian belief finds that the Bible and the theory of evolution are incompatible! Amazing, right? Too bad Pegg and Frost, as clever as they are, show here that they are not so smart. To paint any group with an overly broad and disparaging brush, as with any overgeneralized mentality as they do with ""Christians"" here, is ultimately unforgivable and so spoils this otherwise enjoyable flick.",Paul
157,mcw6957,Oh Edgar where art thou.......,1,19 March 2011,"Im going to make this brief because I found this whole experience too painful to relive. Paul is a movie about a foul mouthed alien who crash lands on earth for 60 years until he escapes & is picked up by two vacationing English men on their way back from Comic-con. The men in question are Nick Frost & Simon Pegg & rather get into an extensive essay of their career lets just say that Paul is one short of their usual creative process. The other piece of the puzzle missing here is Edgar Wright. For the record I love Scott Pilgrim. Anway Paul right look I get what Pegg & Frost were aiming for but it just doesn't work. Greg Mottola subs for Wright & up until this point I had nothing against his resume. I liked Adventureland & Superbad was entertaining. So I went into Paul with no objections or expectations. I just wanted to laugh & enjoy myself regardless of any reservations lurking beneath the surface sans Wright. However after 45 minutes of just being beaten over the head with crude language & oh yeah Seth Rogen as Paul smoking it up every few seconds I know what a stretch right! This shtick ran its course with Pinapple Express & recently ruined Green Hornet. Enough already. Im not against dumb humor or light hearted fare but this material is beneath Frost & Pegg. This reminds me of my youth all over again. Great comedians being reduced to disposable entertainment. Pryor,Cosby,Carlin & so on. Look I know you've got to put food on the table or maybe you want to reach a broader audience so you make a few crowd pleasers but come on. Apart from Star Trek Simon Pegg has been flying solo in one easy to swallow movie after another. OK fine not my thing but its separate enough from that world he helped create that it doesn't damage its credibility. Teaming up with Frost for a third go is a definite grab towards that geek demographic & yet what we get is something more suitable for the masses. Call me naive but this feels deceptive. Do your crap movies for whatever reason but don't bait the fans who have supported you since Spaced. Im not big on the theory that one bad movie or album sinks someones career so on that note lets move on.I hope the fourth time around overshadows the third.",Paul
158,wilsr,Better than Hot Fuzz,4,24 April 2011,"This movie is better than Hot Fuzz.I give Hot Fuzz a one out of ten, so that's not exactly saying much.If what makes you laugh is a constant drip of rather tired clichés strung together with a couple of running gags, then along with you to the movie theatre. But if you are looking for an inventive, interesting comedy about a couple of ordinary sci-fi Joes who happen upon ET around area 51 then don't expect too much.One is always aware that Paul is a CGI artifact, and I suppose it's a measure of how good the technique has become that one can criticise the rendering, but he doesn't quite appear as real as I would expect in 2011.Paul has most of the fairly rare good lines: Frost and Pegg spoil many of theirs by overacting. Hot Fuzz again.....Watchable if it's a rainy day but really a dragged-out sketch.",Paul
159,SombeeKillah,"""Sorry You Got Killed By My Dad. """,3,11 April 2012,"I was very disappointed by this film. I guess I was expecting something more from Simon Pegg & Nick Frost a la 'Shaun of the Dead' way. But no way. This was like a complete turn around and they were not even funny to me at all. In fact they were really kinda of annoying as two British nerds who are so naive and dumb and act like two little kids.. They overkilled the nerdness. I don't know about these things since I was never a nerd anyways so who knows what I missed.Pegg & Frost look just a tad too old to be believable as these two naive nerds. But I guess that's what the script called for and they did what they could. Jason Bateman came off a little better playing a straight laced, no humor type FBI guy named Agent Zoil. Lovely Kristen Wiig did OK but she really didn't shine on either as a also naive bible-raised sheltered girl who gets involved with our nerdy duo. Bill Hader as one of Bateman's cronies did a little better and that's why I can see he lasted a little longer than the other guy who was his partner. The great Jeffrey Tambor had a nice cameo bit as the eccentric and weird sci-fi writer Adam Shadowchild.(interesting note:Both he and Bateman plus the director had worked together on Arrested Development) Blythe Danner had a nice turn as the grown up version of the child who encountered the alien at the start of the movie. reminded me a lot of Melinda Dillon's character from 'Close Encounters of the Third Kind' I'm thinking yet another homage as this movie is filled with quotes and references to other similar themed movies. Blythe even gets to say one of the most classical lines in movie history to none other than Sigourney Weaver! Who actually said it in her 'Alien movie 'character,Ripley! ""Get away from her ! You B*$%^&!"" Seth Rogen as the voice of Paul did nothing for me. Had he done it where every time Paul encountered a human being with different accents and he per say would have taken the accents himself in a mocking making fun type of way ,then maybe it would have been amusing for me but this way with Seth just being Seth and talking like a complete know it all annoying surfer/valley dude voice, just did not cut it for me. Maybe Seth Rogen is not that talented enough to pull it off with accents and voices as would a Robin Williams or Jim Carrey could , who by the way would have been excellent casting cause either of those two guys would just have 'nailed it' as Paul's voice. But oh well, maybe in the sequel.Oh and by the way Steven Spielberg has a voice credit cameo. That to me is the final indicator that this whole film was but a homage to him mainly and his films and also a nod to all the other great Sci-Fi themed movies that came before it. It even opens with Comic-Con with a lot of Star Wars types and even the bar they go to has the Mos Eisley Catina song from Star Wars playing.All in all, nice but no thanks.",Paul
160,SoutheastUK,Could and should have been better,3,1 November 2012,"Parts of this movie were funny, but the good was somewhat overshadowed by the bad. It started well, but meandered, seemingly lost from about 1/3 of the way in, with the ""plot"" becoming as muddy as the amateur attempts at feeding the Christians to the lions.I am not religious myself but it did seem that the writers were going out of their way to force the ""there is no god"" message to the point of almost desperation. I couldn't help wondering what Christians had done to these people to warrant such an attack, but regardless, it detracted from the movie on the basis that it is not the place of movie writers to force belief - or in this case removal of belief - down viewers throats. As a cynic, I am always suspicious of anyone who feels it necessary to take pot shots at those who are unable to answer back there and then.Shaun of the dead et al were funny on their own merits but it does seem that this movie was simply unable to carry itself through without cheap gimmicks and lazy plot vehicles.

Most of the things Paul does are regular alien stuff ( bringing someone to life, punishing the evildoers with some blasts) that we had seen before, but this time in a regular human way - which we have not seen before.There were some lolz moments, but overall falls way sort of expectations.Watchable if you have no other movies on desk.(originally posted @ weirdo-on-movies.blogspot.com",Paul

I could see most jokes coming before they got there. Same for the punch lines. It was like watching comedy writing in very slow motion. I realize Seth is a comedic icon of our time, but his voice just did not fit that alien. I couldn't get past it. It was weird.Throughout the movie, I could *see* what they were trying to do.

163,baberchik,Well done and not cheezy at all,7,21 August 2012,"I think the most problematic part of making a comedy with an alien is not to have it become to cheezy, too childish, ""too much human"" perhaps? In the case of Paul it seems that by making it more down to earth and cheezy beyond any measure a kind of ""the movie is so bad it's good"" effect, though in a very positive way, is achieved. Paul is not just funny but it's original, it also re-invents many jokes in a way that doesn't seem to be ripping off any other movies. The movie is enjoyable from start to finish, with a number of interesting twists and is entertaining even though some jokes are just childish, but have just the right amount of adult humor that will keep 99% of the audience laughing. If you have not seen this movie - get your friends together, get some beers and a pizza and have a fun evening. Paul delivers in every scene.",Paul

Next they rent an RV head off on trip round various well-known alien encounter sites. On their first night out a car speeds down the road out nowhere, overtakes them and crashes right in front of them. They get out to see if the driver needs help and discover the driver is Paul (Seth Rogen), a short green wise cracking ET. Paul begs them to help him escape from a mysterious government agency led by The Big Man (Sigourney Weaver). He has been held for 60 years while he was interrogated for all his knowledge and now they have finished doing that they want to cut him up to learn about his special alien abilities. He has escaped and now needs to go meet a rescue ship. Graeme agrees to help eagerly but Clive is less certain but finally goes along with it.They stop for the night at a trailer park run by Creationist Christian Moses Buggs (John Carroll Lynch) and his daughter Ruth (Kristen Wiig). When Ruth comes round to collect their money for berthing up for night she meets Paul and she collapses in dead faint from the shock. They flee from the park in a panic with the still unconscious Ruth. Moses alerts the police and soon government agents turn up, led by Agent Zoil and rookie agents Haggard (Bill Hader) and O'Reilly (Joe Lo Truglio). The agents and Moses Bugg chase after the RV as it head towards Paul's rendezvous with his rescue shipThis film is a lot of fun. It's not a hilariously funny film and I found I was sniggering a lot but there were few big laughs. Clive and Graeme are Frost and Pegg and they are charming naturally funny guys and are also as nerdy in real life as their characters.In this film they got to play characters that allowed them to indulge their interests. the script is full of lines taken from classic sci-fi films and I enjoyed playing spot the references. A lot the humour is pretty crude and there is a running gag that Paul has inspired many of the ideas of modern popular culture. Paul is amusing but I wondered if there was a problem dubbing on Seth Rogen's voice because it didn't quite blend in with sound of the film and there were times I could tell it was recorded in a studio far far awayThe rest of the cast are pretty good though I did think Ruth and especially Moses were bit of a caricature. I know it was done for laughs but it was a bit of an easy target to poke fun at the crazy Christians. In a lot films about friendly aliens on Earth we get the innocent alien learning about human culture but Paul is already an expert and it is Ruth who learns about this strange new world of swearing and penises and kissing boys. The agents especially were a lot of fun. Sigourney Weaver was great playing The Big Man as an over the top mega bitch and I am sure Simon Pegg will treasure his scene with her near the end for a long time.Rating 7/10",Paul

Movie mostly relies on heavy use of swear words to create jokes but it didn't work for me. Two leading characters looked dumb. 30mins into the movie, I was wondering how on earth this movie got this much of positive reviews. To me this was one of the most boring comedies I have ever seen.

The directing was spectacular, the writing was great as well, and everything is handled fantastic. I'm definitely gonna watch this film again, had a blast with it, and basically anyone who loves comedy can enjoy it. A very humorous look at the mysteries behind Area 51. Greg Mottola really nailed the directing here, truly enjoyed that aspect. Other than that, my only issues with this film is that I wanted a little more background about Nick and Simon, and I wanted more background about The Big Guy, she felt kinda too mysterious and had a bit of an empty personality. Besides that, I really recommend this film, if you love either Nick and Simon or just a fan of Comedy- check it out.",Paul

Recently in movies it seems so lazy to throw several f-bombs at the audience where it doesn't actually add to the story or even the punch line. When is David Mamet going to write a comedy? Now there's a guy that knows how to punctuate a sentence with a curse, dammit.In a movie that challenges religious beliefs and is prone to quote several different Sci-Fi flicks it shouldn't let foul language take the focus. ""Paul"" is the title of and the central character in Greg Mottola's (director of ""Superbad"") new film about an alien that crash lands on earth in 1947. He is now trying to escape back to his home planet. Paul is a mix of E.T. and Alf. He is similar in texture to E.T. and he has a boisterous personality like Alf. Think of him like this - if E.T. crash landed at a frat party instead of Elliot's back yard he would have developed into Paul.We begin our journey with Graeme Willy (played by Simon Pegg) and Clive Gollings (played by Nick Frost) two Sci-Fi geeks from England on holiday in the states. They begin their journey at their Mecca ""Comic Con."" This is a convention where Star Wars, Star Trek, D & D, LOTR, and Dr. Who geeks, nerds and dweebs (I am not being mean, it's the truth) meet every year to intermingle with one another and see what new geek fan fare awaits them for the coming year.After the duo meets their science fiction idols, they rent an RV and start their road trip to all the famous UFO sites in the Southwest -Area 51, Roswell and the Black Mail Box (I had to Google that one).They soon cross paths with Paul (a CGI character voiced by Seth Rogen) who is on the run from government agents. Graeme and Clive agree to abet Paul in his escape. On the way they pick up a RV rest stop attendant, Ruth (played by Kristen Wiig). This is where the jokes start fluctuating where before they were just falling flat. Ruth is a right wing conservative Christian who believes the earth is only 4,000 years old. If she owned a car, you could bet it would have a bumper sticker that reads ""Read My Lipstick."" Paul soon ""converts"" Ruth to think outside her strict Christian upbringing to believe in extraterrestrial life. While adopting her new life she feels that she needs to curse more to explore her newfound freedom. Her expletives would have been very effective if it hadn't been for everyone around her cursing their fool heads off too. There is a time and place for everything. I don't feel that a comedy movie about a fouled mouth, dope-smoking alien is the place to discuss Intelligent Design (Oh my god, I am starting to sound like my mother).With a Secret Service agent (played by Jason Bateman) on their tail, the gang starts making their way north with Paul to find his mother ship (it's a movie about aliens, of course there is a mother ship). With plenty of action and a few more wisely placed one-liners from famous Sci-Fi flicks, the story finally climaxes in a way that you would expect from a comedy film about aliens.Should you see this movie? Are you a geek, dweeb or nerd? Then yes, go see it. You will enjoy the ""Star Wars"", ""Aliens"", and ""Star Trek"" references. If you are a true fan, you will be rewarded for hording that geeky trivia since you were 12 years old. It was good to see Pegg and Frost back together again. However it wasn't the same clever writing as we came to expect from ""Shaun of the Dead,"" a film that didn't need a lot of cursing to be funny, just a lot of blood and guts.",Paul
169,carvercape,Sponsored movie,3,9 June 2011,"I love Hot Fuzz, Shawn of the Dead and rest of Simon Pegg's work so I had high hopes for this movie as well.At starters it all look promising but it does not take long to get disappointed in the story.Like Fan boys, this movie feels like it has been sponsored by George Lucas and Spielberg. I agree, both of them made big influence on modern cinema and story telling, but then if you strive for your movie to be a bit original this is no way to go. Referencing someone else work is one thing, but Pegg went bit to far.And than there is Paul, the highlight of the movie. Although well animated and rendered it is neither funny or sarcastic enough. It does not leave any impression on you as neither movie does mainly due to poorly written screenplay.Truly disappointing, considering the capacity of it's authors.",Paul
170,MikeK1987,Perfect crossover of the Pegg/Frost and Judd Apatow camps,9,31 March 2011,"I loved this movie. Plain and simple. It's a solid comedy. But it's also a great road trip film, it's got real legitimate drama, and it's just got a great story in general.Personally, Simon Pegg and Nick Frost can (almost) do no wrong (ahem... ""How To Lose Friends and Alienate People""... ahem... ""Star Trek""... ahem...). ""Shaun of the Dead"" and ""Hot Fuzz"" are two of my favorite comedies. I don't get why some people are bashing this film just because Edgar Wright didn't direct it. Greg Mottola did a fantastic job. I'm not so sure this movie would have been so radically different had Wright directed it anyway. What matters is that Pegg and Frost still wrote it and the story, the acting, and the character development, big parts of the Pegg/Frost/Wright films, are all still here.Speaking of the acting, this film threw some great players like Seth Rogen, Bill Hader, Joe Lo Truglio, Kristen Wiig, and Jason Bateman into some really fantastic roles. Yeah, the only real ""fault"" that I found with this film (if you can even call it that) is that, at first, some of the characters come off as cliché. We've got the dumb rookie cops, the overzealous veteran, the boss looking to get a job done no matter the cost, the geeks, the damsel in distress, the abusive father, but out of these clichés come characters of depth who in some way we can all understand their motivations, with the notable exception for Sigourney Weaver's character. She's not given much screen time, but she seemed to suffer from the same problem that befell Stephen Lang's character from ""Avatar"". After a while the motivation disappears and they just want to shoot and kill stuff, just because they're the bad guy. But once again, that's really the only problem I had with the movie.I also found the central character of 'Paul' to be the best part of the movie. He's not just another special effect like Jar Jar Binks or the badly inserted Jabba The Hut from the Special Edition of the first Star Wars movie. He's actually a well fleshed-out character that makes me forget that he's an effect at all. And some have faulted him for being ""too human"" by having Seth Rogen's voice and picking up human traits like swearing and smoking, but you also have to consider the fact that he's been on Earth, cooped up in a military base for over 60 years.The references in this film are all so well placed and well timed. I'm not going to give any away, but for the most part, when the references are made, they will absolutely have you laughing, if you're up on your science fiction films. And even if you're just a casual movie-goer, you may still enjoy them anyway.Now if you're religious in any way and really don't like it when somebody who doesn't believe in god offers up his 2 cents, then you might just wanna go right ahead and skip the rest of this review and click on the 'not helpful' button.I was happy that somebody finally considered the possibility of what discovering aliens might mean for our outdated belief systems here on the planet Earth. As someone who went to 12 years of Catholic school, and then afterward (almost literally) being hit over the head with a high energy dose of the real world, it scared the sh*t out of me that everything that I had been taught is pretty much wrong, outdated, and harmful to the human race, and that the universe is so much bigger than we can imagine and that the beliefs of the smartest apes on one tiny blue planet situated in the spiral arm of just one galaxy in a cosmos of billions upon billions of galaxies really doesn't matter in the grand scheme of things, and whatever deity we had shoved down our throats during our childhood, probably doesn't exist, at least as we know it.For me, they captured that shock and realization on film perfectly, in the scene when Paul gives Ruth the extent of his knowledge (was that a Doctor Who reference, Simon and Nick?) and the way her character finally opens her eyes (with a little assistance from Paul) to rational thought. And despite what you may think, no, I'm not trying to make everyone on the planet atheists, that would be irrational and spiteful. But people need to start waking up, and it's a breath of fresh air to finally see that some people in the film industry no longer have their heads up their (where the sun don't shine).Also, some have faulted Kristen Wiig's character, Ruth, for cursing way to much after she receives Paul's knowledge. Yeah, it's annoying, but you still have to realize that she was a backwoods evangelical Christian who has been suppressed all of her life and is now finally waking up to the realization that none of that matters! If you were in the same situation, you'd curse like a sailor too! And just as badly if you never knew how to curse before. Also, I'd like to thank Wiig (or whoever was truly responsible) for the phrase ""Dick Milk""! That was hilarious!Anyway, if you are still reading and/or haven't given me a 'not helpful' response yet because of what I just said, then take it from me. I left the theater smiling. I was thoroughly entertained by this movie in more ways than one. If you're a fan of any of the people that I just mentioned, a fan and believer in aliens, or at least have an open mind, then go see ""Paul"".",Paul
171,scarletheels,It has its moments of utter hilarity,6,7 March 2012,"A couple of British comic book geeks, Graeme Willy (Simon Pegg, Shaun of the Dead) and Clive Gollings (Nick Frost, Hot Fuzz), are in America for a science fiction convention and a subsequent RV roadtrip to the famed Area 51. En route, they meet an alien Paul who has been inhabiting a top-secret military base for the past 60 years. Desperate to leave Earth, he convinces the duo to help him get to the mother ship's landing area. They soon find out that Paul is being chased by a relentless government agent, Agent Zoil (Jason Bateman), who enlists the assistance of two inept feds, Haggard and O'Reilly.They end up kidnapping Ruth (Kristen Wiig), a sheltered, unyielding religious zealot, which prompts her father to join in the pursuit. Along the way, they visit Tara (Blythe Danner), the human whose dog Paul crashed his ship on six decades earlier. After years of ridicule and harassment, she's relieved to see Paul does indeed exist. Graeme, Clive, Paul, and Tara flee the premises after Zoil, Haggard, and O'Reilly raid her house. With the agents and Ruth's father hot on their heels, can they get Paul safely to his mother ship in time? Fans of the zany U.K. pair will relish this sci-fi/comedy collaboration featuring the voice talents of Seth Rogan as Paul. It's directed by Greg Mottola who also directed the rude, crude Superbad and Paul follows in its footsteps with a lot of swearing and vulgar humor. Not as laugh out loud funny as Shaun of the Dead but it has its moments of utter hilarity. Sci-fi nerds will appreciate many of the references to movies like Close Encounters of the Third Kind and E.T., to name a couple. The CGI Paul blends seamlessly in with the flesh and blood characters. I loved the cameo by Sigourney Weaver - she's still kicking ass and looks beautiful and cool doing it. I do have to warn Christians and other religious types to avoid this movie if you can't take a pretty harsh mocking of your beliefs. Ruth's entire life is measured by her strict moral code, only for her faith and Bible instructed principles to be shattered by the knowledge of the universe that Paul telepathically shares with her. She transforms from a wholesome girl (although, wholesome may not be the right adjective, considering she wears a shirt that has Jesus shooting Darwin) to a cussing, pot-smoking, sin-seeking fugitive. Just a warning.",Paul
172,taywarren29,"Hilarious, Perfect Type Of Humor",8,29 October 2013,"First off, who comes up with this stuff?This movie was so comedic and the alien was perfectly animated in every scene and he was absolutely hilarious. The Christian lady really ticked me off and totally ruined the movie for me because that was just really annoying, I don't know anybody who is that psychotically religious to be that annoying. And the fact that she was missing an eye was kind of dumb and didn't have to be part of the movie.The main protagonist's accents were also a really good addition to the hilarity of this film and I really enjoyed their acting as well. This movie would have been perfect without any romantic add-ons as well.",Paul
173,mitcherator777,Good movie,8,24 February 2012,"I enjoyed this movie, if you are looking for a great Comedy/Sci-fi type film I would highly recommend this film.The reason I give it an 8 is because it portrays Christians in a negative light - not all Christians are like these crazy people portrayed in the movie and also I am a Christian myself. Christianity is not a list of rules & does/don'ts as this movie portrays I.e. don't smoke, don't cuss, don't etc...Christianity is a relationship with God not the list of does & don'ts or a laundry list.Other than that I enjoyed the film very much.",Paul
174,jimjoe12543,A trainwreck of homophobia,1,6 October 2020,"I absolutely loved Spaced, Shawn of The Dead, and (to a much lesser extent) Hot Fuzz. Pegg and Frost should equate to hilariousness in anything they do, but Paul starts off terrible, and just gets worse and worse. Didn't bother watching past the second use of ""f*gg*t"". This movie came out in 2011 and I couldn't have cared less then, finally watched it in 2020 and, even for 2011, that's just unacceptable. That word was unacceptable in Bill and Ted's Excellent Adventure in 1989, and it's extra-unacceptable today.The movie centers around two best friends who, in nearly every other scene, adamantly argue that they're not gay, could never be gay, and are just extra-super-not-gay because ""icky! gay people!"". The entire movie seems to focus around just how totally not-gay they are. It's tactless, boring, and unfunny. Seth Rogan is a disgusting human and pathetic comedian, and was just as unfunny in this as he has been in every single thing he has done. One half-hearted chuckle in the 50 minutes I wasted on this movie.Pegg and Frost should be ashamed of themselves for this piece of s**t.",Paul
175,matrix29,Don't waste your time or money on this lame movie.,2,1 August 2014,"First, the good points of the movie. The photography is good, even in dim light, the images are clear and sharp. The audio (what there is of it) is well-recorded.There you go. Enjoy.Now onto the bad points. The script was probably about 2 pages long. There isn't enough dialog to fill even that much up. One hour per page of movie. One episode of the comedy series ""ALF"" has more comedy than this entire movie. And ""ALF"" has a more interesting character, a more engaging alien character, and a better family to play the comedy bits off of.The plot itself is lazy. Obscenely lazy. Rage-inducing-lazy. Here is the plot. Two British men-children (Simon Pegg is losing what made his character so interesting in ""Shawn of the Dead"") go visit the town of Roswell, after they damage the truck of two also-boring characters, a car crashes in front of their rented Camper-Truck. Inside is the Grey Alien that calls himself ""Paul"". He can turn invisible, heal wounds, bring things back to life, and transmit information by touch (think of the alien character of ""Roger"" from the ""American Dad"" cartoon, but 1000 times less interesting). A FBI guy and two ""Men in Black"" (actually employees of the Roswell Tourist Industry) chase after the alien ""Paul"" and the dull man-child characters driving the camper-truck.Blah blah blah, they end up accidentally kidnapping a rest stop's partially-blind Fundamentalist daughter. Blah blah blah, she gets ""divine knowledge"" from Paul and becomes a toilet-mouthed non-Christian jerk. Plot continues with 3 sets of people chasing the irritatingly-uninteresting men-children. By now this movie should be the standard chase-movie buddy-comedy high-excitement thrill-ride.Right? Okay, so WHY IS THE MOVIE SO INTENSELY BORING? Rude-language is not a shocker when the populace no longer regards it as shocking. Where is the humor, the character interest, the dialog, the action? Go rent either versions of the movie ""It's a Mad Mad Mad World"" or even a Mel Brooks movie or better yet, the Chevy Chase & Goldie Hawn movie ""Foul Play"". That's how you do an exciting comedy ""Road Trip"" movie.This movie is just DULL DULL DULL. It plods along with the robotic predictability of dominoes being knocked over. No real surprises, dialog so sparse you could pad it out with the rise & fall of 10 empires. This is, by far, the most uninteresting & least entertaining movie Simon Pegg has ever appeared in. If you rented this movie, enjoy the nice boring pictures and the clear audio, because they chew through the two pages of dialog at about 5 minutes per paragraph.My recommendation. DO NOT buy this movie. DO NOT rent this movie. IGNORE IT. It does not exist and did never exist. Otherwise you will be very angry at Simon Pegg and his fat fart joke balloon buddy, the human Whoopie Cushion. This isn't a movie, it is Exhibit A for a lawsuit of Entertainment Fraud.",Paul
176,jimmerw,Forced Vulgarity,6,21 February 2012,"I really enjoyed most aspects of this movie. It was a fun alien romp. However, I am not a fan of Seth Rogen. I find most of his films force vulgar language where it isn't needed. Yes, vulgar language is a part of our lives and it has a place in cinema. But it's as if they forced vulgar language into scenes in this movie that just sounded forced. Natural vulgarity adds to the realism of a film, but here, there was just too much that added nothing. As far as the movie itself, I rather enjoyed it. Nothing epic, nothing Oscar worthy, but a fun film to watch.I rated a 6, but if the forced vulgarity was kept to a normal amount, I could have given it a 7.",Paul
177,Syxiepoo,Gotta love Paul,10,3 August 2016,"I've seen this a few times now, and it cracks me up every time. My taste in movie genres is quite broad, but I'll admit it tends to lean more towards Sci-fi. My favourite Sci-fi movie is, and probably always will be, Forbidden Planet. That said, my favourite Comedy Sci-Fi is, absolutely, Paul. Even though I know what's coming, I still laugh out loud. There's been a long-running dialogue on here about the merits of this movie as regards religion .vs. atheism. This movie is NOT a sounding board for that particular debate - if indeed a debate was needed. The story-line seeks to use as one element, the interplay of the two beliefs (non-beliefs?) in relation to the existence of other life forms in the universe. Having said that, I worry that folks are putting way too much emphasis on these matters. It's just a very funny comedy film based on a Sci-fi premise ... and I love it! Just read my strap-line.There's real life ... and then there's movies!",Paul
178,lbk,Unintelligent script,3,24 July 2012,"The idea and the intentions are good. What a shame it fails miserably in the making. Not technically, the CG is superb, but the script seems like it was written by 8 years old boys.The problem is that the script has nothing to offer but clichés. Spielbergs ET was childish and that's OK but the dialog and acting in Paul is infantile. I felt embarrassed watching Paul because the dialog was so unintelligent. Maybe there is a large audience for infantile clichés and I am out of touch?No point in the movie is surprising, no attitude is beyond 3rd grade children. The dumbest passage in the movie is Nick Frost attacking Paul in the van. Any way out premise is fine, but human reactions and behavior has to be believable. This scene was plain dumb. How it could pass the quality control of a scriptwriter, a producer, a director and an actor (oh, some are the same!) is a mystery. The role played by poor Sigurney Weaver is so laughable that it is beyond belief.In reality this is not a sci-fi movie, it's a mystery movie. The mystery is how such an infantile script can get $40 mio. to be made.If the script had a run-through to clean out the dialog clichés, the hammy acting, the ridiculous postures ... it would have been a great little movie.",Paul
179,jeffreyjets,So very sorry that I watched this movie,1,4 September 2011,"I watched much of what Simon Pegg has done and found it to be very clever in an understated manner, probably the British in him. This though was a Seth Rogen movie which is curse words and fart jokes humor. This had such a chance to be funny and clever at such a high level but instead sunk to Seth Rogen's level. There seems to be a lot of people who like that and I am sure they pre-order the newest recording of Larry The Cable Guy as soon as they can, but I am not a fan. The acting was fine and the plot while overdone was OK, but there was nothing to pull it together and for most part entirly and utterly without humor 95% of the time. I can't wait to get back to when pervasive foul language was not funny and you need to actually be clever to write a script.",Paul
180,vlevensonnd-1,"They R Hilarious, But The 2nd Half Crashes & Burns",1,27 March 2011,"I wanted to see this movie (even though I saw no previews to it) because I think Simon Pegg is absolutely hilarious. I've been wanting to see him in his other movies, as well as Nick Frost, as it is extremely apparent that they make a awesome duo.The first half of this film, I laughed very much out-loud in the theater, as did my friend, and as did the full-house audience. We were having a really good time with it. Then the character of the one-eyed woman and her Father were introduced. From that point on, it became an over-the-top, all-out, no-holds-barred, everything-goes, Christian bashing movie. THANK GOD that the laughter from the audience was cut to nearly nothing during the second half. It was definitely not just me who was offended.For the past couple decades I've noticed the dramatic and frightening increase of verbal attacks and intolerance against Christian's from this particular culture, and it has become so INCREDIBLY blatant, harsh and so common-ground (this movie drug it on throughout the ENTIRE later half), however, if someone so much as merely disagrees with something one of them may be doing, someone will scream ""Intolerance!"" or ""Anti-Semitism!"" Why the difference??? For those of you who may not have had a complete education in prejudism; by simply not agreeing with something or someone from a different culture does NOT mean it's prejudism. If we disagree with something our child, spouse, friend, or family member does or says, reprimanding them does NOT mean we hate or loathe them - on the contrary - it's because we desire others to use more amicable manners and methods that express respect and acceptance towards others.How ironic that some want others to constantly remember what they were forced to suffer through, yet some want to create a Christian Holocaust in the country where Christianity WAS THE FOUNDING FAITH, AND one of the countries that went to their aid and allowed multi thousands into our own country so they could be safe. We did that from our hearts, but we didn't do that so our own country could be turned upside down and our faith could be horribly spat upon.I would give the first part of this movie a 7, but because of the later half, a zero. Sorry guys, I don't care how popular ANYONE gets - it just doesn't ever give a person the right to bash other people in such a horrendous manner.",Paul
181,eevanz,At least they tried to be funny...,1,20 November 2016,"This is one of the films that forces you to think as the author imagined, a lot of the stereotypes and weak arguments. It feels as if you are forced to listen to a stupid man that talks 2 hours. Yes, there are a few funny scenes, but it's transformed into ""swill"".It's not about whether you are religious or not, but the movie shows a forced belief of the author and without any arguments, but uses the stereotypes that are not really arguments. You feel like you are in the prison of stupidity. I really do not like movies like that. Also, it's very predictable, you just wait when it will happened, imposing the wrong model (drugs, bisexuality, ""strong"" language...).I think every film needs to have a lesson (final word) and this garbage have: smoke, be gay - it's fine, there's no God, drugs...Just do not waste time on this.",Paul
182,toby-brace,Blinding light,10,11 July 2012,"This one totally surprised and delighted me. Simon Pegg and Nick Frost have been doing this schtick for a while now, and it shows. I was expecting something along the lines of Shaun of the dead, and it is of the same exact genre, but they have got better at it, and the production is bigger and better too. But the best part of all is the writing. What really began to suck me in was the superb and very funny use of well known and well loved references towards the end of the film. I kept seeing and hearing things that I instantly recognized and it made me laugh out loud. Then there is the character of Paul himself. Never would I have believed I could become so fond of a CG character, but this one is a real star. It was a tough part to pitch correctly. Too much in any direction and it would become, well, a cartoon. But Paul is totally credible and several times outrageously funny. Incredible job they have done here. The ending was also very carefully pitched. It could so easily have turned awful sweet or corny. But they kept it together. It was perfect. A really really fantastic film.",Paul
183,d_3434_d,"Hollywood takes bashing Christians further, now with a hippie alien",2,1 July 2011,"Nice CGI. Everything else is pure hippie propaganda.Smoke drugs; have sex with anything or anyone you want; curse wherever, whenever you want; humans are disgusting misfit creatures and creatures from outside of Earth are by default superior; we are all here by chance, there is no good reason for our existence; worship the government (and not God) and give all your property away to the government; hate Christians because they are inbred retards; and so on. That is what Hollywood is trying to shove us down our throats and Paul takes that bit further than most other movies. Now Hollywood is trying it with a bisexual hippie alien. Needless to say, that is why Paul has such a high rating on IMDb. It has everything that IMDb voters seem to be obsessed with: Christian bashing, a bisexual protagonist, etc; oh and let's not forget that Paul looks like a children's movie.As the description of the movie states, it's about two comic nerds encountering an extraterrestrial ""übermensch"", as the Nazis would state. The nerds and we are therefore ""untermenschen"". From there on we are treated to witness how we are worthless, especially the Christian kind, as the movie happily portrays Christians to be imbeciles for believing in God. To be ""down"" with the ""cool"" ""übermensch"" and its ""untermensch"" comrades you have be ""rational"" and not believe in creationism. Believe instead in the (equally not proved) evolutionism. You don't need God when you can have a socialist paradise, as the movie will try to lead you to believe. Stealing is good, as ""übermensch"" comrade Paul will show us.Everything the movie does goes along those lines. It's like watching an alien Nazi or an alien Soviet propaganda movie, if such a thing would exist. As the matter of fact, if you want to watch this movie I suggest checking out some Nazi and Soviet propaganda movies first. By the time you are done watching this movie - that is if you will be able to make it to the end - your mouth will be wide open. The only difference between this movie and fascist and communist propaganda movies is the CGI and the fact that it's taking place in a different time.In short, it's a horrible movie. The story is put too often in the background to make room for socialist propaganda. There is nothing else about this movie that will be of any interest. While the CGI looks somewhat nice, Paul is basically a standard pop culture looking alien; big eyes, big head, small body, green skin color, etc. Add two comic nerds to befriend him, throw in some Christians to have antagonists around and make the government involved. If you have read the description of the movie, you will know what it's basically about. In fact, the description of the movie is by far more interesting than the actual movie. At least the description looks interesting. The movie is not, it's highly predictable, you know exactly what is going to happen, there is no reason to expect any quality from Hollywood and this movie proves it.Please keep your kids as far away from this movie as possible. I would most definitely not recommend this movie, unless you are studying socialist propaganda.",Paul
184,Filmaholic78,Goes from a flat pants waste of time to a solid funny comedy,6,28 February 2011,"I have very mixed feelings about this film. I love Shuan of the Dead and Hot Fuzz so I was really looking forward to seeing this one.However I started to feel this sinking feeling as I was watching it. I just couldn't gel with the film and felt it was really flat and to be honest, a bit boring to start with. Yeah it had a few laughs and giggles but it wasn't the standard I was expecting or used to.Then about 30 minutes in to the film took a turn for the better, thank god. The dialogue became faster and funnier and felt like the film it should have been from the start.My advice to anyone thinking about seeing Paul is expect much of the same humour you got from the previous two films and if thats your cup of tea then stick with it as it will get better.If I rated the film in thirds I would say the first third is 3 stars, second third 6 stars and the last third 8 stars.",Paul

Throw in Seth Rogan and Sigourney Weaver and be ready for all hell to break loose on the big screen. Paul hits your funnybone from the first scene to the last and the humour is infectious,I haven't heard an audience laugh so much in the theatre since..well since 'Hot Fuzz"".

Sci fi is not my favorite genre, but I have seen most of the sci fi classics. I didn't know what to expect as I am not always a sci-fi comedy fan. For instance, although mildly entertaining, I wasn't wild about ""Hitchhikers Guide to the Galaxy"". I was wild about some of the cast members, but not really the film.So, we arrived and the theatre was packed. They were turning people away at the door. Although I had qualms and wasn't sure I'd like it, it turns out I LOVED it! ALL of the audience members seemed to laugh themselves in to hysterics through much of the film. And the ENTIRE AUDIENCE CLAPPED WILDLY AT THE END!WARNING: This movie is NOT for the devoutly religious or for those who are offended by swearing and sexual references. Period. If you THINK you might be offended by anti-religion humor, swearing, or sexual references, then don't go. And I would recommend it for older teens only; NOT young teens.Amazingly, during the first 20 minutes or so, I found myself thinking 'This is delightful! If only they could keep it THIS funny for the rest of the film..... so many comedies start out with a bang and then are just ""tired"" by the end of the movie.....' But I couldn't have been more wrong. It not only kept up a wonderful pace, but introduced many great characters along the way.If you enjoyed ""Shaun of the Dead"" and ""Hot Fuzz"", this will be right up your alley. There were lots of sci fi movie references (Alien, ET, Close Encounters of the 3rd Kind, Star Wars, Aliens, Predator, etc.) It had an AWESOME cast, MARVELOUS character development, and a terrific script that went from sweet and moving, to hilarious, to scary, and back. It was really SO MUCH FUN! It is lewd, it will certainly will be offensive to some American Christians, and it is totally sci-fi, but it's absolutely hilarious. So, you sci-fi comedy lovers, GO!! RUN to the theatre to see it on the big screen. Take friends and enjoy, enjoy, enjoy!",Paul
187,leprutz13-1,Good for boring Sundays,5,24 January 2012,"Paul It is nothing more then a very typical road movie. It all takes place in the United States and involves two comic creators from the UK that go on a trip, sightseeing the important places where apparently extraterrestrial life form has been sighted. They accidentally meet a quite unique, English speaking, swearing, funny little alien, named Paul. All three embark on a journey to save his life, while he is being hunted down by the government. Of course We all know lead us to, friendships develop, they struggle and fight, fall in love for a girl, etc, etc, etc. Bla Bla Bla.I can't really say much about the screen writing nor the direction or the photography and the editing in this film as it is quite simple and fit to tell the story perfectly. Nothing that is worth being mentioned or even criticized.The only thing I might throw in as a devastating critique, is the fact of trying to convince us so hard that the belief in something so extraordinary like God is wrong or simply pathetic. I am not saying that I am believer, but I am not the opposite either. I accept: saying something is not true, while having the proof. And saying there is nothing more absolute then Darwin's theory (evolution, etc), is kind of childish. Specially when nowadays scientist still struggle to find out what is what and are still uncovering facts that might reject the Darwinish theory completely. Nothing is as it seems. And an alien of such knowledge would know that better then us humans.I was not bored with the movie, I was not really laughing, but mildly entertained. Average for me 5 out of 5 even though there is a quite interesting and un expected turn in the movie. Good for boring Sundays.",Paul
188,jerry07,Had potentials but bad overall,4,24 November 2012,"The story line sounded interesting and while I would not have paid the movie theater ticket based on the previews, seemed like a possible light entertainment as a video rental. It turned to be a near total waste of time, the previews essentially showed all the worthwhile jokes.The amount of pure profanity (swearing) is also supposed to make this funny? I don't know but I passed the age of ""cream-pie in the face"" and Beavis & Buthead style ""laugh at the word fart"". They seemed to be fillers for a lack of better gags and real jokes and some of those jokes are repeated multiple times over the movie: yeah we got it - two guys, traveling in a RV - must be gay! Not so funny but we could give a ""Ha! Ha!"" moment ... but not the third or forth time! There would be potentially good moments and good lines made by the Alien, Paul, but the acting seemed terribly flat to me and it was hard to enjoy the ""moments"".I cannot even understand why people would have given such a high rating. I gave a 4 at the end as I have seen worst but don't expect much of this.",Paul
189,musanna-ahmed,"After lampooning the cop-buddy and zombie flick genre, Pegg and Frost take their turn to meet E.T and do the same.",8,15 February 2011,"Shaun of the Dead – great. Hot Fuzz – brilliant. Paul, The third collaboration between the two best friends Simon Pegg and Nick Frost is another action-packed comedy featuring an alien, guns, and Jason Bateman. Unlike the previous films the pair starred in, Paul still has the strong bromance between the two but takes a turn to be more of what Scott Pilgrim Vs the World was instead of Hot Fuzz.Scott Pilgrim – directed by Edgar Wright who also directed the first two films mentioned – was a geek-friendly action comedy. Paul is more of a geek-friendly comedy. It's crude, so think Superbad (Greg Mottola had directed that too) instead of Shaun. Then add the whole 'comic' tone of Scott Pilgrim – the great action scenes but less violent and amusing ones instead, and two geeks who are into comics rather than in the comic like Scott Pilgrim was. And add E.T gone comedy with the voice of Seth Rogen. Plus add a cameo from Sigourney Weaver. Then you have Paul, a geeky, clever, and very funny film but simultaneously you then have its problem.As you could probably figure from the description above, the problem being said is that Paul tries to pack too much in during the encounter with the alien itself. The running time is a perfect 104 minutes. But by the end of those 104 minutes, there are several suggested sub- plots and alternate directions that could have been taken to reach the destination. One sub-plot involves Paul shattering Ruth's (Kristen Wiig) faith. It's an odd film to have a religious subtext in and it will maybe have questions thrown at in terms of what message is trying to be said. Nevertheless, those 104 minutes are brimmed with pure entertainment and the plot is established enough to make sense and not take a wrong turn.With an ensemble cast, what makes Paul especially hilarious is how every character in the film has a moment of comedy gold. That includes Adam Stevenson – famous writer whom they meet at a Comic-Con festival and simply has five on-screen minutes. Five amusing on-screen minutes. Pegg and Frost are as funny as they were before, fizzing chemistry over Area 51, still the brilliant duo that work better than Pegg and Andy Serkis did in Pegg's last film Burke and Hare. They're buddies with mutual buddy-love that are better together than most odd pairings. It's (probably) guaranteed that they will stay as the best British duo even off-screen as Thomson and Thompson in the upcoming Tintin film which is to be directed by veteran sci-fi director Steven Spielberg. It's reported that Pegg and Frost said that Paul was a love letter to Spielberg – it sure is an amusing one, and is certainly the best Valentine-themed film this Valentine's Day.The pair wrote the screenplay for this film – so expect many contemporary references – plenty of sci-fi ones – and clever gags. At times, the jokes can feel a little self indulgent; inside jokes that would probably confuse most and only careful listeners can interpret the clever jokes. The majority of the script, however, is a laugh-a-minute ride with some recurring jokes that become funnier and funnier throughout. Paul's part of the script gives a big L to The Green Hornet; Seth Rogen was much funnier off screen. The actor was miscast as the green superhero so there were dreads of him being miscast as this green amiable alien but kudos to Pegg and Frost because this was the perfect script for Rogen to show that The Green Hornet's failed hilarity wasn't detrimental. Looking at another view, if Rogen was the screenwriter for Paul, then maybe it would have been of the dull standard of the Hornet unless he can still write something on par with Superbad. Imagine that.Paul may be a funnier film for the more clever/geeky viewer. If that's the case, the words 'Cult Following' can be seen written all over it. For all other audience, Pegg and Frost haven't diminished in their comedy quality from their previous films even though Paul may be broader than either of them. If Scott Pilgrim was the geekiest film of last year, Paul definitely wins that title for this year. It may not be an Out of This World film (pun partially intended) but lays claim to the most hilarious film of 2011 yet.Verdict: Your money's worth – Paul is the funniest film there has been in ages.",Paul
190,WLRSky,A surprisingly Atheist comedy with a stoner alien,7,13 September 2021,"This movie honestly was a blast, it is very fun.Seth Rogan, Simon Pegg and Nick Frost all did great jobs in the movie.A lot of funny lines, moments and references.Cons, tho - the movie tries to hit you with tension / emotional level on certain scenes... but you cant feel it because its kinda predictable whats gunna happen.But overall, very entertaining film with fun people.(Spoilers)Do u think Clive and Graeme recognised Weaver from Alien Movies? Lol.",Paul
191,gigadragon12,Paul is a sci-fi Hot Fuzz,7,19 March 2011,"Paul is the latest in the line of Simon Pegg and Nick Frost's parody-buddy tales, best known for Shaun of the Dead. If you haven't been living under a rock the past few months, then you'll know that Paul is their foray into sci-fi. Paul is an alien who is seeking to escape the planet from a ruthless ""big man"" that's chasing him down. He runs into Graeme (Pegg) and Clive (Frost), two European nerds come to America to attend Comic Con and tour the U.S.'s notorious alien sites. Paul tasks them with transporting him ""north"", and thus they begin running from the ""big man"" who immediately gets after them.We'll start with the good: Paul is a funny movie. The jokes, from general one-liners and screw ball style jokes to movie references, both sci-fi and non. To be honest when I heard about a lot of references in the movie I was a little worried I'd feel left in the dust as I only have a general knowledge of sci-fi and don't partake a whole lot into the genre outside of reading books, but really I was able to recognize more lines and references than I figured I would, though it did every now and then do or say something that was CLEARLY a reference and I could feel the wave of laughter somewhere over my head. Luckily, the times of this were not many and I found myself laughing a lot.But there are a few weak links in Paul that deserve reference. There is a point in the movie where it discusses Creationism vs. Evolution. In the movie there is a very heavy handed push that Evolution is the way to go, and its so strong that it could easily negatively influence the movie for anyone who believes otherwise, and to be honest, even I found it a little shaking. The movie barely attempts to make it funny at all and seems like one of those angry cousins you want to avoid talking to at the family gatherings because he's right and he knows it, and he'll show you. And that's coming from someone who personally agrees with the views expressed in the movie. I should mention that its only two characters that argue either viewpoint, and the rest of the movie pays little attention to the subject, except to treat the matter as a joke. It doesn't tie in to the movie as a whole.Besides that large point, the movie really, unlike Hot Fuzz and Shaun of the Dead, seems to have the plot for the pure purpose of setting up their jokes. The story was treated as something that would get in the way of the jokes they were trying to tell, and more often than not things happen for the pure sake of the movie referencing another movie or getting another cheap laugh from a pot joke or a curse word in a weird place. BUT I should mention that even someone like me who thinks story is something essential was able to get past the shallow story and appreciate Paul for its own unique humorous charm without anything unnecessarily getting in the way.Oh and I suppose there's one more point, the credit roll at the end seems to treat itself like a big applaud for Simon Pegg and Nick Frost for actually finishing a project, and sort of wraps the movie up as a big present. In a way its really just selling the hell out of itself, and it's a movie that at best is good, as in par, it beat my expectations because I was thinking, after Hot Fuzz, that one viewing wouldn't be very appreciable. It hurts the surprise from the movie being enjoyable to see Frost and Pegg so heavily patting themselves on the back for this jamboree of movie references and vanilla storyline. But hey at least it had some dick jokes in it. Guess we can give an Oscar for that.No, really besides the large paragraphs of potential issues, Paul is a sci-fi Hot Fuzz, there's plenty of humor to enjoy, Pegg and Frost are as English as ever and aside from a few swollen heads, they have successfully made another funny movie. Too bad they can't get back to the Shaun formula of things. Guess you can't compare everything to a masterpiece though.",Paul

193,borkoboardo,Fresh from the assembly line...,5,16 June 2011,"This is going to be short.This is a serious example for once-quite-talented-writers-and-actors-gone-out-of-ideas. Paul is a very predictable, painfully boring and really unfunny movie. I understand there is people out there who buy the same story over and over again if it's coated with a new wrapper, but i see not even a good story recycled. In fact I am a fan of the duo Pegg/Frost - I thought this film would blow some fresh air into the quite tired generic sci-fi-genre nowadays. Unfortunately it didn't...This is just a montage of gags mostly based on Star Wars (again), the side-story of Paul (yes, it's a side-story) is Paul himself, an alien needing humans to get from A to B. Simon Pegg and Nick Frost are those humans privileged to accompany this cool cynical 50-year-old comedy show host disguised as an alien that has some cool abilities. That said, Paul doesn't bring much alien features, except for looking like the stereotypical drawing that we all know.Already as the story starts unfolding you assume what's going to happen - et voila, it happens (again). The dramaturgic strings are poorly written, the content aspects appear like the writers had a checkbook ticking off each single point, the story itself is very generic as there is nothing whatsoever new in this. Pegg and Frost are also just not really convincing as Sci-Fi-nerds and the humor is just so predictable, it hardly ever becomes surprising or funny. Maybe this is a trend reflecting US-American slapstick in its declining phase in the late 1990'ies - films became very ""uninspired"" at that point. Let's just forget about this one and give Pegg and Frost another chance, after what they've created in the past they deserve it.",Paul
194,HollywoodVixen90,Paul is AWESOME!!!,7,31 March 2012,"I was really anxious to see this movie once I heard about it. I am a big fan of Simon Pegg and Nick Frost, those guys are hilarious. I loved them in ""Shaun of the Dead"" and ""Hot Fuzz"". When I saw that these two were pairing up again I was 100% sure I would like this movie. To me this movie did NOT disappoint me at all. I really like it. It was funny, and if your a nerd or kind of a nerd like me and into sci-fi, you can relate to it. I'm not a fan of Seth Rogen either but I thought he did as awesome job as ""Paul"". I know a lot of people are upset because of comments made on Christianity in the movie, but I mean come on! I'm not religious but in my opinion I've heard way,way worse in either other movies or stand-up. I loved this movie, and I am 100% sure that I will be buying it to add to my collection.",Paul
195,Kings_Requiem,The 1st Great movie of 2011,8,20 February 2011,"Wow, what a ride! No matter what you look for in a movie this has it all. Comedy, Action, & Sci-Fi are all blended together nicely and the result is probably the best film of the year so far.Finally back together again after the massive successes that were Shaun of the Dead and Hot Fuzz, Simon Pegg & Nick Frost play two British nerds on a vacation in America. The first stop on their list is San Diego where they check out the geek extravaganza known as Comic-Con. After scoring the coveted autograph they were after, their journey continues on to Area 51 where they meet a weird old lady, a couple of hillbillies, & a potty mouthed alien named Paul. Paul has been hiding out on the military base for the last 60 years and now for whatever reasons has decided that he wants to escape and get back to his mother ship. And so begins the funniest and craziest road trip/adventure since Planes, Trains, & Automobiles or Midnight Run.The cast of characters that these 3 meet along the way are some very familiar ones in the comedy world. Jane Lynch, David Koechner, Jason Bateman, Bill Hader, Kristen Wiig, Jeffrey Tambor, Blythe Danner, John Carrol Lynch, & of course Seth Rogen who voices Paul the alien. Seeing all these familiar faces pop up throughout the movie is a great treat to fans of comedy. A lot of inside jokes and special nods to other films from the sci-fi genre are sprinkled throughout and fans of genre should be able to pick up on them get a great enjoyment out of it. Props should also go to Director Greg Mottola for having the balls to even attempt such a beast of a movie.Everyone definitely brought their A game for this one and it shows. Good funny performances from all including Seth Rogen who, despite getting on a lot peoples nerves, really does have a knack for these voice roles and he didn't annoy me at all. Fantastic direction from Greg Mottola who is now in my opinion 3 for 3 in directing with Superbad, Adventureland, & now Paul. Damn good job of writing by Pegg & Frost too as they crafted a really funny story that pays perfect respect to the movies in the genres that have come before it. Kudos to all involved, damn good work.So... whether you like comedy, action, sci-fi, romance, or adventure, then you're gonna absolutely love 'Paul'. The combination of all these genres fits seamlessly with this cast of characters and they bring on us a ride that as a movie you won't soon forget. Also, be on the lookout for a cameo at the end that will slap a big damn silly smile on face.",Paul

For me it was the comedy that lured me in to watch this movie. Any film Simon Pegg and Nick Frost appear in together is comedy gold being best friends in real life shows on screen they've got such good chemistry.
For me though the underdog, under estimated, under appreciated comedic actor in this film is Joe Lo Truglio. He's so funny in this he as impeccable comedic timing, just the faces he pulls will make you belly laugh. He flys under the radar with the TV shows and films he appears in but those projects wouldn't be the same if he wasnt involved.
All in all this is a very funny movie, couple of the clever jokes which kind of feels like an insider jokes got a bit tiresome for me but most of it was funny. Alien smoking weed what's not to like.",Paul

I like all of the funny films that Mr. Pegg has been in he looks so much like my brother in law and you just cant fake that sincerity that he brings. All the Aliens I have met Legal and illegal have all been like Phil or Paul, they leave there home in search of a place where they feel like they can belong, find friends, drink and try to reproduce with inanimate objects.

202,Otterman_MK2,Why can't these things happen in real life?,8,6 April 2011,"This film is not on the same level of quality as 'Hot Fuzz' or 'Shaun of the Dead, but it's more than worth a watch.I will always love films starring Simon Pegg and Nick Frost, so my opinion is slightly bias. The film has a simple but fun storyline: Two English comic book and sci-fi geeks go on a road trip to the USA, beginning at Comic Con. Evenually they visit Nevada and the Area 51 perimeter- this is something that has inspired me as I am also English and would love to visit the USA, especially Groom Lake. But, there journey is interrupted by a typical grey alien named- Paul! Soon they are pursued by Men in Black as they race across the country, trying to get Paul back to his people. It's all good fun.I think Seth Rogan did a fantastic job as the voice of Paul, a character you just have to love. Also, the CGI itself was fine, but the interactions between Paul and the humans were very realistic and well done.Pegg and Frost are also fantastic, but their characters are not as interesting as in Hot Fuzz.Something I personally loved about the film was the fact that Paul was a reason for a lot of the political decisions in our history, and also created the 'alien grey' phenomena due to his image. There was also a lot of comedy making fun of religion and (being an atheist), this was all good humour. It's got a few problems here and there, and no it's not the same standard of comedy as their previous two films, but Paul is one adventure you should not miss.",Paul
203,Strawberry_Typhoon,"How often do you get to see a little gray man sit around a camp-fire, get stoned out of his mind, and tell dirty jokes, anyway?",8,23 February 2011,"""Paul"" is the new film from director Greg Mottola. Greg is responsible for such films as ""Superbad"", ""Adventureland"", and one of my personal favorites, ""The Daytrippers"". The film was written by Simon Pegg, Nick Frost, and Seth Rogen, who also star in the picture. The story begins as Clive(Frost) and Graeme(Pegg) have traveled to American in order to meet their favorite science fiction author at Comic Con. An altercation with some local hill-folk at a rest stop leads them to make a hasty get-away in their recreational vehicle. On the highway, the two see a pair of headlights in the horizon and assume it's the rednecks from earlier. It turns out to be a car, that in-turn crashes in front of them. Stopping to see if everyone was okay, they realize that the drive of the car was actually Paul(Rogen), an alien that's just escaped government custody. From here, the trio set off on a cross country journey to get Paul back to his home planet.One of the things that surprised me about this film is that they opted for the R-Rating. Granted, Mottola's work has been adult oriented for the most part, but it seems like they would have went for the cash-in on this adult homage to the classic film ""E.T."". I still think this would be a fun film to take your children to see. There are several strings of randomly grouped curse words, so it maybe not suitable for the ultra young, but if my son were around 8-10, I would have no problem with him seeing it. There's no nudity, no extreme gore, just a few F-Bombs, and some sexually suggestive dialog. I still think that this was a cute picture, and could be enjoyed by families that aren't too stuck up. To be honest, when I saw the trailer, I assumed that it would be a family film. It was surprising to me to hear the language, as they could have easily had a big PG-13 box office turn-out for this affair.Taking into consideration the bodies of work from both the director, as well as the stars, this is by no stretch of the imagination any of their best work. It would be hard for anything to stack up against Shaun of the Dead, and even Hot Fuzz. Mottola's most well known film is undoubtedly ""Superbad"", though I personally prefer ""Adventureland"", as his best ""new wave"" comedy film. If I were to attempt to make a comparison to anything, it would be to the Kyle Newman directed ""Fanboys"". It's similar in style, as it's clearly an homage to classic cult films past, and it's loaded to the brim with pop-culture references. Some recognizable to the casual viewer, and a few nods to those of us that are serious cinema addicts.I was kind of dreading the film, to be honest. A CGI Alien voiced by Seth Rogen? Don't get me wrong, I'm not a snob, and I am a fan of Rogen's films. This just seemed like it would be silly to me, though. It was surprisingly entertaining, on several different fronts. It works as an homage, an almost kiddie friendly romp, and an adult themed dick and fart joke comedy. It was fun to seek, and spot the references to other movies-such as the obvious, ""E.T."", but also ""Mac & Me"", And even ""Aliens"", complete with a running cameo by none-other than Sigourney Weaver. Speaking of Cameos, almost the entire cast is comprised of special guest-stars and cameo performances from some comedy greats. Bill Hader, Jane Lynch, David Koechner, and many more.I had a fun time with this lighthearted comedy. It was great to see Pegg and Frost back on the screen together, and the back and forth between them and Rogen was highly entertaining. Jason Bateman is also a favorite of mine, and he does a good job at being the cliché' agent on-the-hunt character. As slim as the film selection is during this time of year, this would definitely be something I would recommend getting out the the theater to see. It's not the best film of the year, but it's fun. How often do you get to see a little gray man sit around a camp-fire, get stoned out of his mind, and tell dirty jokes, anyway?",Paul
204,EvilMissQB,Seriously enjoyable,10,27 March 2011,"Let me begin by saying that Paul is a movie by nerds for nerds about nerds. If you don't enjoy movies that glibly poke fun at themselves and fan-boys, you might as well go watch the King's Speech or something. Paul is not meant to be high brow, cerebral entertainment. It's meant to be funny and does an excellent job of it. There are a ton of giggly 'did you find the hidden (and occasionally not so hidden) reference to a beloved sci-fi film' moments that will appeal to all of us who live for space aliens and epic comic book movies. There are curse words and other cringe worthy language in such abundance you might want to leave the under 16 crowd at home but not much worse than that aside from continual references to boobs. Enjoy the action, enjoy the fun and leave the moral subplots to the foreign films.",Paul

Some people might find some of the religious comments and jokes offending (I think some of those jokes were good),so beware.The best: Paul, a really enjoyable character. Unfortunately the other characters were not that interesting, and made the story drag a bit. The worst: It just felt like a story that has been told so many times already (geeks & aliens), it stopped being funny.Score (4)",Paul

With the actors from Shaun of the Dead - i thought it would be a good one but it is really bad. The special effects are the only things good about this turkey. The story line is about the same as any B alien movie. Paul is an alien, captured by the government, tries to escape to get back home, some humans are helping him get away from the evil government agents, and so on. It seems like the writers went out of their way to make an anti-religious anti-Christian movie and that really gets in the way of the plot. They spend way too much time on the anti-religious part and not enough on making the movie funny. Don't waste a minute of your life watching this foolish stupid piece of crap.

The movie is driven by a good story and spiced with comedy here and there. Which in itself is a good combination, and it worked well for this movie.Not to forget the CGIS in the movie. They were excellent. The character Paul was so nicely made, and the textures of his skin, face and eyes was off the charts. And those effects really helped carry the movie.""Paul"" is a good movie, though it is not Simon and Nick's best movie, it takes a lot to top ""Shaun of the Dead"".

208,vladtopliceanu,The best science fiction comedy film of the year,8,1 January 2012,"I loved this film! When I started watching this I was thinking it was going to be a 6. But it actually surprised me and I found this movie being a great science fiction comedy film, and I haven't seen one of these in the longest time.To promote this movie I think I should start off by saying this movie was produced by Tim Bevan and Eric Fellner. Well, Nira Park also produced it but she doesn't have that of an important resume. If you do not know what Bevan and Fellner have produced together I will just mention a few titles:Four Weddings and a Funeral, Elizabeth, Atonement, Frost/Nixon. Now, can you tell you don't like any of these movies? But now let's get into the actual business.First of all I thought the screenwriters, Simon Pegg and Nick Frost, who also stared in two of the main roles, did a great job writing this. There were some jokes that weren't really necessary in there but in the end it worked out OK. And speaking about Pegg and Frost I thought their characters in the film were great. They had great chemistry and I felt they had a lot of fun working on this movie, and I always like it when that happens. Probably one of the strongest features for me concerning this film was the whole concept. I mean I know there were a lot of references to Steven Spielberg but I loved each and every one of them. And I absolutely adored Paul. Part of the concept, I really liked seeing how life on Earth can affect an alien, not that I had ever wondered about it before.But the exaggerated humor, the minor but obvious flaws downgraded it to an 8.

209,Imay_37,Whats wrong with you guys?,1,16 February 2011,"'hot fuzz' was totally boring, don't watch the film just watch the trailer, i tried to sit through it 2-3 times and i fell asleep, okay maybe i was tired but i never fall asleep watching a movie. 'shaun of the dead' was good, maybe cos he was just a bum working in a crappy job which most people can relate to. sometimes you end up liking a film cos of something you can relate to and not all films can be brilliant. 'paul' wasn't very good but the actual alien paul, voice of seth kept it from falling flat, he and it was funny. people think this is only a movie but Hollywood just had to put in the same simular message they keep doing, 'god doesn't exist'. you believe in aliens or god or maybe both and eventually they'll convince you to believe in just aliens. come on people, make up your own minds. by the way, 'i went to see 'ghost' in cinemas on feb 14th, brilliant fillm, at least i knew that was gonna be a brilliant film, shame i'v seen it too many times to be surprised or moved, but the cinema experience was pretty good. 'Who sent you? What do you want? Get off my train? get off my train'",Paul
210,alone_onthebeach,Shoulda watched it in the cinema!,7,11 May 2012,"I knew it that I should have watched this one in the cinema! I watched tons of movies around the time that Paul was released and the trailers was seductive enough to make me considered watching it the next time; but the next time becomes the next next time and so on. It is hilarious, well-scripted and the scene sequences are well-edited. Paul was given a regular weed-smoking American regular guy attitude and this is funny when you see it in a green martian-looking creature. The characters introduced during the desert chase were varied and each added to the fun. We see many movies in this genre in the past but many of them are just to add numbers to your DVD rentals so that you get a discount. By giving Paul regular human characters, the director can give him the usual jokes / lines. As an outerspace alien, many more range of ability / inability that Paul has makes the movie quite fun to watch. The only quirky idea was using two British actors. Am really sure, any regular American ones would have been much better. Paul is enjoyable, funny and deserve a 7 from me. If they show it again in cinemas, I would watch it there next time around.",Paul
211,petesherratt,One joke film and that joke ain't too good,3,26 February 2011,"Really rubbish effort from a team that a lot more could have been expected from. The same joke (alien acts just like us!) is constantly repeated to the precise same effect, namely muted half smile turning to groan when you realise that the 4 year olds that the joke can only be aimed at cannot see the film. The best of the film is when the Pegg and Frost are bouncing lines off each other but any of that chemistry is completely missing when the CGI blob alien on screen and Wiig is an empty vessel in this. Sean of the Dead was impeccably written and hilarious, Hot Fuzz had some good jokes in it but they seemed badly stuck together with chewing gum, and this is just desperate. Could it be that they are not being given enough time to come up with a decent script or could it be that they struck lucky with Sean? Only the next effort will tell...",Paul
212,dazzking,Funny.....Very Funny,9,3 April 2011,Well I've been waiting to a while to finally watch this film since seeing the trailers and I have to say I was not disappointed.Pegg & Frost are a great comic duo and their films I find are always top quality British humor and I'm glad to say Paul didn't disappoint.Although I did start to have my doubts after the first 20 minutes as many contributors have said it did start a bit on the slow side the film finally found it's feet once the foul mouthed and foul mannered little Grey guy arrived.It's not often when I watch a film and get tears of laughter rolling down my face but the one part of the film in the comic shop with the MIB guy was puerile quality.I hope the make a Pauls very soon.,Paul

214,jerrybrsc2,Simon & Nick Hit Another Home Run,8,1 February 2012,"(SPOILERS) This film is a wonderful homage to some of the most influential films in pop culture. The plot basically follows two ""Super Nerds"" on vacation from England to ComicCon and the American Midwest in search of E.T. proof and/or nerdgasms, and then quickly turns into one of the most hilarious renditions to pop culture I've ever seen set against the backdrop of a cross country chase. Paul relies heavily on pop culture references for the bulk of it's humor, which could be why I enjoyed it so much. This being said, it still has plenty of jokes that will appeal to the average movie goer and every one of them is laugh out loud funny. This film references E.T.: The Extra Terrestrial, Sugarland Express, Star Wars, Alien, Jaws, Indiana Jones, and a myriad of others that are too numerous to list here. In short, if you like movies that rely on real world pop culture references for a good amount of their humor, then there's a good chance you'll love Paul. If you're not crazy about those type of movies, in my opinion there's still plenty of comedic material and a smart enough script, (written by Simon Pegg and Nick Frost themselves), to keep you entertained throughout. I highly recommend Paul. I hope you enjoyed the review and hope you take it into consideration if you decide to go check it out.",Paul
215,SiamakZ,A great mix of E.T.-esque sci-fi & hilariously comedy,8,2 August 2011,"(extended edition)Simon Pegg and Nick Frost team up once more and have brilliant chemistry as usual. They start off as two British geeks at Comic Con, San Diego. On their grotesque voyage in their RV to Area 51 an alien riding a car literally crashed into them. Seth Rogen is the perfectly casted as the rude alien Paul. Or maybe the part is tailored to suit him... Paul is is like a midget Seth wearing an alien suit... Perhaps that makes him less special than E.T., but now at least he provides us with some good laughs. It's a great parody/homage with plenty of references to their source material. Along the way the trio meets up with a crazy bunch of people, I'll let you discover them yourself. It leads to a cat-and-mouse chase with some sidequests. In the end, this film is a successful sci-fi comedy, but mind the frequent swearing. My score: 8 out of 10 My rating: PG-13 or 12(NL)",Paul
216,justinmo-1,"Pegg and Frost minus Brit-Com synergy, Just OK",4,21 October 2011,"Paul is a comedown from Shaun of the Dead and Hot Fuzz, it's not as good at all despite what promoters say. But as those two were excellent movies this one is still watchable and funny, just less so. As an opinion I think this is because Pegg and Frost work best in context of their background in British comedy and a lot of the quality of the earlier movies arose from working with a lot of other less known British comedians in a synergy; while this one, sans-milieu, shows up the gaps in their laid back presentation and makes humour a bit thin on the ground and they seem a bit vapid. The sublimated social commentary which energizes their humour works best at deeper levels of involvement than those they have for America. Paul shouting ""horseshit"" at a creationist doesn't have any of the resonance of the ""hoodies"" theme in Hot Fuzz. The Americans and the X-Files themes are good in their own right but the CGI special effects with Paul aren't as interesting or funny as all the other personalities and senses of humour they could have accessed in the UK. I think I'll still be snapping up anything they make in Britain but if they keep going in the USA I'll leave it till it's remaindered to look at it.",Paul
217,darrell-19,Disappointment meets Missed Potential,6,21 February 2011,"Really disappointing for fans of Simon Pegg's previous work. All the small-town charm and British humour has been ironed out and replaced with the tired, American 'stoner' gags. Imagine trying to enjoy 'Shaun Of The Dead' but the whole time Seth Rogan is burping smelly pot burps in your face, and you are pretty much getting the picture. The only time the film attempts to be anywhere near highbrow is with a thread about evolution vs creationism. The boys meet a girl who is a stereotypical bible-belt American Christian; and meeting an alien opens up a debate about her belief in creation. It is neither funny enough to be a joke nor balanced enough to be taken as a serious point. I hope the ill-thought out points get both Christians and atheists alike hopping mad, as neither are represented very well. One of the things that Simon Pegg is known for and has done well in the past is 'in-jokes'; usually quotes or mis-quotes from other movies, comics or TV shows. In 'Paul' the amount of quotes goes beyond affectionate nods to other films in the same genre and into the world of parody. By the time Sigourney Weaver is told ""get away from her you bitch!"" I was too bored of leaning over to explain to my wife why people were sniggering. That is sniggering, not laughing. Sorry Si - you messed up this time.",Paul
218,jr73340,"Unscientific, illogical, uneducated atheist rhetoric",1,18 February 2012,"As a faithful Christian I can assure all viewers of this movie that there is nothing ""crude"" about the film in terms of sex, violence, language or gore. The film is actually quite innocent in that regard. However, as a Christian, let me also say that this film offended me more than a pornographic film. Although this film is supposedly a comedy, it nevertheless insists on commenting on some very deep subjects, such as the existence of God, the validity of Christianity, the existence of an objective moral law and the SUPPOSED (and ridiculous) idea that Darwinism somehow disproves Christianity. Now, if you are seriously going tackle these complex issues in a non-offensive, non-rhetorical way, they need to be addressed within the context of a serious film that is working on a high intellectual level. That is simply not the case here. The film uses toilet-high-school-bully humor to comment on topics that are WAY of its league. The meaningless-atheist-rhetoric in this film is as illogical, unscientific and brainless as the fundamentalist Protestantism its criticizing, and the people who made it are too stupid and uneducated to see that.",Paul

There is a lot of alien swearing in the movie so maybe not for little kids but definitely a movie I could watch more then once just for the laughs I got from the funny alien parts, its nothing like any other alien movie you have seen before. So if your religious and don't like swearing then I suggest you don't watch it, but if you love aliens and don't mind the language then it is definitely worth renting.",Paul
220,laurencetuccori,PAUL: appaulingly dismal entertainment,2,10 June 2011,"With each subsequent release it's becoming increasingly obvious that Simon Pegg's smash hit success as writer and star of 'Shaun of the Dead' was a fluke rather than the birth of a new cinematic comedy talent. The eagerly anticipated follow-up 'Hot Fuzz' was a damp squib, 'Run Fatboy Run' limped along, and now comes PAUL which, uninspiring title aside, is bereft of any real laughs. Pegg re-teams with his 'Shaun' co-star Nick Frost as Graeme and Clive, a pair of comic book geeks who find themselves caught up in a surreal chase across the wilderness of Nevada, Utah and Wyoming in the company of a 4ft tall alien called Paul. Paul looks like ET and sounds like Seth Rogen, which is probably because he is voiced by Rogen phoning in his performance with the minimum effort. Paul confounds almost every one of Graeme and Clive's long held expectations about how a space alien should behave but none of it's funny. His lines and most of the set-ups are lazy and flabby, relying on the old comedic fall back of ""it's funny because we (Pegg and Frost) are in it and we are comedians ergo the scene's funny"" instead of writing something that is actually funny. I'd like to say it's self-indulgent humour of the ""you had to be there"" variety but I was there watching PAUL and I still didn't laugh. Not simply a misfire, and certainly not a future cult classic, PAUL is just a monumental waste of time.Read more of my reviews at www.thefilmivejustseen.blogspot.com",Paul
221,davggsco,Paul - A Wavy Davy Review,7,21 February 2011,"Greg Mottola's latest film, Paul, is a funny, smart comedy written and starring two extremely likable British leads. So the question I have to ask is why I felt somewhat disappointed when leaving the cinema. The answer is relativity. Sure, Paul has a decent number of funny moments but in comparison to Superbad - Greg Mottola's most famous film - it does not compare favourably. Mottola's previous film, Adventureland, also outshines Paul due to its significantly superior heart and character-development. If you were to compare Paul to Simon Pegg and Nick Frosts' previous films, Shaun of the Dead and Hott Fuzz, I am again placing Paul at the bottom of the pack. This comparison is hugely unfair to Paul, though, as next to these films, most comedies would look inferior and the truth is that with the exception of last year's 'The Hangover', there are very few comedies in recent years as funny as Paul.Simon Pegg and Nick Frost star as two British comic-book nerds taking a road-trip through America's alien hotspots. On their journey they come into contact with a huge variety of American comedians/Judd Apatow regulars such as David Koechner and Jane Lynch (both in criminally underused and unfunny roles). The laughs mainly come from the titular character, a CGI alien voiced by Seth Rogen. The main strengths of the film emanate from Rogen's character, with jokes ranging from the immature (farting etc) to the slightly more intelligent (challening Christian beliefs). Indeed Paul's conversations with Pegg and Frost are the most interesting parts of the film. The supporting roles are on the whole, weak: Jason Bateman, Blythe Danner and Bill Hader have largely unfunny, hardly likable characters, while Kristen Wiig (playing the role of Pegg's love interest), resorts to a flurry of grossly low-brow comments. On top of this there are extra supporting roles for Gregg Turkington, Joe Lo Truglio and John Carroll Lynch.The aforementioned names may seem like a long list of characters for a one-off movie and this actually becomes a major drawback for the film. When Pegg and Frost pick up the fugitive alien Paul, they are subsequently chased by most of the actors mentioned above, primarily Jason Bateman's horrible antagonist Lorenzo Zoil, but also two extra agents, an angry father, two hillbillies and latterly another famous actor in a supporting role. The truth is that since the film follows the paths of so many supporting characters, we rarely see any development for the primary trio of Pegg, Frost and Rogen. While in Shaun of the Dead and Hott Fuzz Pegg and Frost were distinctly characterised (albeit stereotypically) as well- meaning loser and idiotic slacker, in Paul we see very little of their respective characters. The two comic book nerds are barely developed at all, other than Pegg's character falling in love and Frost's annoyance that Pegg is falling in love.Despite this, a number of good gags make the film worthwhile although the humour is hit or miss (a scene featuring Steven Spielberg is distinctly out of place). It is unfortunate that the finale is underwhelming and the appearance of a famous sci-fi actress is unfunny. Pegg and Frost, though, are likable blokes even without characterisation, with Wiig as a realistic love- interest and the American stereotype of Paul voiced with childish glee by Seth Rogen, the film manages to hold the attention of its viewers and become an enjoyable, if forgettable, roller-coaster ride.",Paul
222,curt-simpkins,Christian bashing,7,14 November 2018,"I am a Christian and I am deeply offended by the Christian bashing in ""Paul."" So it is unacceptable and not ""P.C."" to bash other religions, beliefs and lifestyles but perfectly acceptable to bash Christianity? No, it is not acceptable, that is intolerance plain and simple! Having said that though, I otherwise like this movie. I am an open minded Christian. To think that we are alone in the universe is an arrogance and is God limiting. As mentioned in ""Paul"" there are billions of galaxies in the universe. I believe God created life here so why would he not create life elsewhere? I certainly believe that it is not only possible but likely that he created life elsewhere. I am a science fiction fan and I appreciate the references in ""Paul"" to ""Star Trek"", ""Star Wars"", ""Close Encounters of the Third Kind"", etc., etc. My father was an aerospace engineer. He designed cryogenic equipment for the U.S. space program from its inception in the 1950's through the space shuttle. He had degrees in math, physics and engineering. He was also a dedicated Christian and he saw no disparity between science and Christianity. In fact he believed that science proves Christianity as do I. I am not even offended by the foul language in ""Paul"" or by Paul's behavior both of which I actually find to be quite funny, however, the Christian bashing in ""Paul"" is unnecessary and is offensive. ""Tolerance"" is a two way street!",Paul
223,electrablind,"""Shaun of the Dead"" alumni bring hilarity in sci-fi comedy ""Paul",7,18 February 2011,"thefilmsmith.com The last time you saw Nick Frost and Simon Pegg together they were in Hot Fuzz, diving through the air firing two guns at the same time screaming ""Ahhh!"" Four years later, Frost and Pegg have written and starred in a hilarious ode to all things sci-fi in Paul.Graeme Willy (Pegg) and Clive Gollings (Frost) are two British sci-fi nerds who visit the U.S. to attend the San Diego Comic Con and visit notorious UFO landmarks in the Southwest. Hijinks ensue when the two pick-up a rude extra-terrestrial named Paul.If you are at all a fan of Shaun of the Dead or Hot Fuzz, you're going to love Paul. In the same ways that Shaun and Fuzz were love letters to the genres they were skewering (zombie films and buddy cop films respectively) Paul is an ode to the sci-fi monoliths of the last sixty years. From the original Star Trek to the recent Battlestar Galactica, references and nerd banter concerning the X-Files and Predator is all over the place. Even if you haven't seen the seminal sci-fi films (Close Encounters, Star Wars, Aliens), the creative deluge of swearing from the charming Paul (voiced by Seth Rogen) will keep you cackling.Who, by the way, looks freakin' amazing. In stills, the CGI character Paul looks clearly fake, but during the actual film he's remarkably realistic. Gollum, though a well developed character who allowed us to look past his digital mask, never looked like he was real during the entire Lord of the Rings trilogy; the giveaway being his bright complexion, which contrasted with his surroundings. In other words, the lighting of the natural environment did not match the character. Throughout most of Paul, however, they have somehow made a leap in syncing the lighting with environment and digital character. The character Paul looked more photorealistic than anything in Avatar.This is also the first film featuring Nick Frost and Simon Pegg that doesn't include Edgar Wright as the film's director and co-writer. Compared to Shaun and Fuzz, you can see how Wright's kinetic sensibilities add the key ingredient to the comedy concoction. Directed by Greg Mottola (Superbad), Paul has the pacing of an awkward first date; coupled with his demure shot placement, the directing can't keep up with the hijinks on screen – it only holds it back.Though Paul has some directorial flaws and even some forced lines, there's too much to love about the film. It's a hilarious, crass comedy which will reward sci-fi nerds with regular references (some less obvious than others). It's also a veritable smorgosborg of comedic notables (though you may react with, ""Oh, that guy!""), featuring Jane Lynch, Jason Bateman, Bill Hader, Kristen Wiig, David Koechner, and Jeffrey Tambor.We're all dying to see the next Edgar Wright, Simon Pegg, Nick Frost film, but for now, at least they have left us some appetizers till they get back together. If you haven't seen Scott Pilgrim vs the World, do it (read my review here), and go see Paul when it comes out March 18.-Remington Smith PS It is amusing that when Frost, Pegg, and Wright can't get together to shoot their final film in the Blood and Ice Cream Trilogy that they make separate, complimentary pictures on different niche nerd cultures: Scott Pilgrim vs the World, a love letter to video game culture; Paul, a love letter to all things sci-fi.",Paul
224,whistlerspa,Sci Fi spoof of the year,8,12 June 2011,"I loved this movie. Have been a fan of Pegg and Frost since Shaun of the Dead and enjoy their genius ability to spoof a genre and still make a thoroughly entertaining and funny movieThis time it's ET, Close Encounters .. , Alien and others that are lined up and blown out of the water, along with Roswell the FBI and comic book and gaming nerds. but all done with impeccably good British taste and style.Seth Rogan (and I'm not usually a fan of his) is superb as the voice of the Alien Paul of the title, and a cameo from Sigourney Weaver complete a superb cast who all acquit themselves well.The story is set around two British nerds doing a UFO themed tour of the US which starts at a Comic-Con convention. As they take to the road they encounter Paul who is being pursued by 'agents'. The chase heats up and other kooky characters join in and become part of the ensuing mayhem. I'll say no more... go see.My only complaint is the overuse of bad language expletives far too often, and although effective on a few occasions are, largely unnecessary. and detract from an otherwise excellent script.",Paul

Simon Pegg and co. have always been my favourites, I've watched everything else they've been in together and it's always funny. This was no different either - basically this film is how E.T. should have been.I won't spoil anything for anyone as I know it's annoying when that happens, I just really recommend watching it if you fancy watching a decent comedy that isn't like all the rest of the ""comedy"" films that have been out this year.

226,rveight-251-982372,A Marmite film it would appear,8,21 January 2012,"If you review the reviews on IMDb you will find that there is a divide between those giving Paul 8 and above and those awarding a grudging two or three, or less. This is a little confusing for such a good natured, mildly humorous film until you read the comments. It would appear that some see it as anti-Christian and so mark it down. I've got Paul on DVD and have watched it three times and there is no real anti-Christian sentiment that I can see.The film has the same intent as Galaxy Quest. It pokes fun at SciFi films but with no viciousness. Indeed, as with GQ, it would seem to have been written by fans of the genre for people of the same ilk. I am one such. I enjoyed trying to find the references that run throughout, not only in visuals and script, but music as well. It was fun.There are a number of little running jokes, one being the 'cool' alien with a foul mouth, another fainting, and a third is that there are two nerds who have dreamt of meeting an alien and when it actually happens they react out of character, one even being resentful.Another thread is what seems to confuse those who suggest the film is anti-Christian.The two leads are hardly on vacation from a stint on the Large Hadron Collider. They are nerds, fans of comic books, with a smattering of scientific knowledge. Many of their beliefs are based on myth and poor understanding of science but they know the words. But the one thing they understand fully is evolution and can come out with all the proper arguments to support their scientifically based beliefs.Paul, the alien, is directly contrary to creationism per se and this is put over in a funny scene. The female romantic lead has been brought up with a strict creationist father. Her reaction to being confronted by something which contradicts everything she believes in is also a theme.If you believe in creationism then this film might not be for you although, of course, the pair in the film who are adamant that it is false are just as weird and loopy and the ones supporting it. You can take you choice. It is hardly an overwhelming tour de force for atheism. They are nutters. I would assume atheists could well be resentful if they felt the two males leads were representative of their group.No group come out of the film without looking silly, the CIA especially. Why should creationists be treated any differently?For the rest of us it is a diverting film, very clever in places, but not enough of them. I've seen it three times in six months and enjoyed it each time. My wife, not a fan of SciFi, watched it with me and enjoyed it each time, so its attraction is quite wide.A lot of it is underplayed, including the first meeting with Paul and the nerds, maybe a dig at Close Encounters, and this is, I think, one of its strengths. No SciFi fan can help but put themselves in the place of Pegg and wonder what they would do in such circumstances.Is it classic cinema? Hardly. Is it laugh out loud funny? Only once or twice. Is it for SciFi fans? Definitely. Should those who favour the Abrahamic religions avoid it? If you can lighten up then certainly not. Is it worth watching? It's a diverting 90 mins or so with lots of little fun parts that you will miss on even the second viewing. Is it fun? You bet.Is it worth eight stars? It is to me.",Paul
227,BottomLineReviews,Hilarious breath of fresh air!,7,10 December 2012,"The foul-mouthed Paul the alien was a wonderful breath of fresh air after watching movie after movie of boy meets girl, boy and girl have lots of sex, boy and girl get into a fight, boy and girl make up and live happily ever after. It was ridiculously refreshing to watch a movie with NO love story at all. I've read a few reviews saying that this movie will only appeal to the nerdy crowd - maybe I'm part of that crowd and just don't know it but I've never been to Comic-Con and I still thought it was hilarious. The computer generated Paul was so well done that sometimes I forgot I wasn't watching a real alien. And the scene where Paul eats the bird... ""Well, I'm not gonna eat a dead bird am I?!"" Priceless.So if I liked the movie so much why doesn't it have a higher rating? Well, it seems like the only people you can make fun of in this world anymore are Christians and I don't really appreciate that. Watching the character Ruth learn how to swear was admittedly, pretty damn funny. But the characters of Ruth and her father were so exaggerated as to be offensive. I know now you're thinking, ""Then why did you watch it???"" Well, I didn't know it was coming and I can't UN-watch a movie.Bottom line: I'd pay $10 to see this in the theater.",Paul

229,winsumlosesum,Great replacement for sleeping tablets if you've run out,2,25 June 2011,"Clearly influenced by 'American Dad's Roger, 'Paul' aims at being a comical sister to it's eighties 'E.T.' counterpart. What could go wrong? Match a smart arsed alien with Pegg and Frost and you're sure to be a box office smash.And that is exactly this films problem. It feels very lazy, with the jokes being predictable and uninspired. Pegg slips in and out of a strange accent in order to try and illustrate that this role is different from all of his others (it's not), whilst Frost stumbles around doing the same old things, only this time a little more fatter.What 'American Dad' gets right is Roger's sense of irony and lack of consideration of everyone for anyone, but at the same time he always gets the audience on his side. 'Paul' however, comes across as a spoilt American kid in an alien suit.Avoid at all costs.",Paul
230,nikki-folwell,Pegg and Frost are still no closer to getting it right for me.,3,24 September 2011,"Better come clean: I've never been a fan of the Pegg/Frost duo. It bugs me when I hear people raving about how hilarious they are. They are one of the most overrated acts ever to make it big. I was one of the ten people who hated Shaun of the Dead. I found Run Fatboy Run only moderately funny. I never even bothered to see Hot Fuzz. Possibly the only Pegg character whom I've liked so far was his weasel in Ice Age 3. When an actor's most likable character to date has been one in which he was only heard and not seen, you know that you've got a problem. So I was thrilled to see the trailer for Paul, which looked well above average in both its premise and its humour. I thought that this could finally be a chance for Pegg & Frost to prove me wrong in my previously indifferent, if nonplussed, verdict of them. Sadly, Paul is yet another tally which allows me to hold my stance. They are no Fry and Laurie. Or Cook and Moore. Not by a long chalk. And Paul is anything but the screaming riot that it should have been.It's such a cool idea: a creature who's exactly like your average stoner-next-door type – casual swearing, frat-boy jokes, loves Reece's pieces – only he's an alien. And the creation of Paul is great; the FX which bring him to life are fantastic and Seth Rogen does a fine job as voiceman. But the rest is severely let down by bad pacing, plot turns which don't make much sense, an awful love interest, and a script which just isn't funny enough. When a film goes this nuts in terms of its story, then it better keep the laughs hearty in order to help you overcome the heavy suspension-of-belief factor and the running time which feels much longer than it was. But because they fall short even on that requirement, by running's end it's that much harder to recall anything enjoyable about the 104 minutes that you just relinquished.So here it is: while vacationing in America, two UK lads named Graeme (Pegg) and Clive (Frost), find a real alien while cruising through backroads, and agree to help him flee because he's being tracked down by the government (at least I think that's what his problem was – they don't explain it very well; just one part of the screenplay which I thought needed improvement). Although nervous initially, they soon bond with him. Then, while holing up in a place to stay, they meet Kristen Wiig's character Ruth, who lives in a trailer park with her strictly religious father and has been brought up to believe no other logic but that to which the Bible lays claim. Forced to re-evaluate her beliefs when she meets Paul, she realises that she doesn't have to live the life that she's been made to, and consequently turns into a foul-mouthed ""free spirit"" – which is funny for about two seconds, until you just want to SHAKE her and yell, ""STOP swearing! It's NOT cool anymore!"" (saying a hell of a lot because, I hasten to point out, I don't normally have a problem with vulgarity). When disaster occurs at her home, they have to take Ruth with them (and I don't really get why they need to do that either) and thus begins more complications on their cross-country getaway as they now have the combined wrath of the government after them, Ruth's angry father, and a third person involved in their secret. But as you may imagine, trying to keep things under wraps gets increasingly harder and...well I won't reveal anymore spoilers, partly because you may still want to see it, and equally because the second half goes so haywire that I can't even remember how it happens exactly. That's how memorable it is.There are perhaps a handful of lines in the movie which did incite a snigger. But sitting through an entire comedy for two or three cheap giggles is hardly worth it. It's hard to explain where exactly it all goes wrong. A large part of it happens when Ruth walks on-screen. Her character absolutely doesn't work. Why did they really need a love interest in a movie like this anyway? Being a movie about two guys who find a space invader, they should've just focused on that. It could've all been saved if they'd just kept it a film about two human fugitives and the wise-cracking alien that they're harbouring, adding at least a few more laughs in the process. Instead, we're forced to endure boring, unnecessary scenes between Graeme and Ruth, who have about as much chemistry as a giraffe and an octopus. You're left thinking ""Get back to Paul."" But worst of all, Paul isn't even the best character. He's cool, don't get me wrong, but ultimately the whole show was stolen by Jason Batemen. The entire movie was worth watching for him alone. His ultra-serious, tight-arse secret agent was awesome, and he was in it nowhere near enough. Every scene that goes back to the gang just leaves you missing Bateman and wondering when you'll see him again. Considering the talent that you could've squeezed out of an ensemble cast this meaty, rooting for only one character signifies another epic failure in the endeavour.Paul isn't horrible, but on account of what went into it, could have been – and should have been – so much more than it was. And it's all because of a weak script written by, as I've said before, a weak partnership. Had it been funnier, I might've been more forgiving of its flaws. The premise was there, but the execution was pulled off like Pegg and Frost just couldn't be arsed making more of an effort. It will now take even more convincing for me to ever want to sit through another outing of theirs. Well done boys.",Paul
231,zombiedeathbot77,"Paul is enjoyable and even fun at times , but also unoriginal, uninspired, and full of missed opportunities.",7,31 August 2013,"Simon Pegg and Nick Frost are back, this time around they are simultaneously spoofing and celebrating comic-con , alien movies, and American culture in the movie ""Paul"". They play a pair of British comic-con nerds and aspiring writer/artists named Graeme and Clive, who are attending comic-con and then touring the famous alien/ UFO sites of the American southwest in a Winnebago. Along the way we meet Paul, (voiced perfectly by Seth Rogen) a stranded E.T.-like alien who is on the run from some shady government types played by Jason Bateman, and his 2 bumbling cohorts Bill Hader and Joe Lo Truglio. Bateman's trademark smarm is unfortunately not on display here as he plays his character rather straight. Hader and lo Trugliodon't get a lot of laughs either. However the character Ruth(played by SNL's Kristen Wig)gets plenty of laughs as the formerly oppressed one-eyed daughter of a fundamentalist Christian father. Sigourney Weaver shows up as well, but her character is pretty unmemorable and another missed opportunity. The plot seems pretty straight forward, and there aren't any real surprises along the way, but there are enough laughs, tongue in cheek references, and sly genre winks to keep the viewer thoroughly entertained.",Paul

I though that it had a very good story-line and it had some real depth. I also thought that once again Pegg and Frost were both good. I thought that Seth Rogen as Paul was an excellent choice, as if there was ever an alien, I would imagine it to sound like him and I thought he fitted the character perfectly. The ending was a bit of a tear-jerker and a little bit of gore but one line makes everything better! Overall I would say that Paul is a great comedy film, if you like typical Pegg and Frost films, this one is definitely worth a watch. I would rate it 9/10 and say that it is suitable for anyone 13+.",Paul

Adding the British cast members was a good idea. England is putting out excellent work these days, and it is nice to see them in an American movie, but they deserve better than this marginal script.. You have been warned.If a 12 year-old boy wrote this movie, it -might- be impressive, but mostly it would be typical.

This movie has it all! Like i said at first, i can honestly say, i laughed from start to end and it just all seemed to fit together and the movie was just great!A lot of people criticise the fact that Seth Rogen in a bad voice actor for the character Paul, but i believed it was a brilliant voice to play the part, i don't know why, it was just perfect!Nick Frost and Simon Pegg... Well, what can i say? I cant really compare Paul to Hot Fuzz and Shaun of the Dead, mainly because Paul, Hot Fuzz and Shaun of the Dead are all completely different genre's and it's produced by a different director, but all in all, it was made well.The only thing i would say which i disliked about the movie was that i guessed the ending. When Paul brought the dead bird back to life, i cant remember word for word, but Graeme (Simon) said ""CAn you bring humans back to life?"" and Paul said something like ""Yes, but it's extremely dangerous and the effects could be put back onto myself""... When i heard that, i knew one of the main characters would die at the end and be brought back to life. But this still didn't change my views of the movie at all, mainly because i didn't know how the character would die and after he was dying/died it was (Believe it or not) entertaining to watch and rather humorous and sad at the same time!One of the main things i liked in this movie is how unexpected a lot of things in this movie is. Such as the ending, before Graeme (Simon) is brought back to life, Paul sends a signal (Fireworks) to the UFO to land and pick Paul up to send him home. Graeme (Simon) is shot and brought back to life and everyone is happy and excited, Graeme gets a kiss and the main bad guy (Sigourney Weaver) turns up holding a gun, everyone is shocked and stairs at her, she starts talking ""Well isn't this just--"" then she gets cut off by a UFO crushing her!

I guess it fun to see it one time. A friend of mine was playing it at his place the other night and nothing about this movie was enjoyable a second time I was annoyed or bored the whole time. Stupid area 51 alien cliché crap that is just old as hell now. Truly the movie just drags and I really hate the whole stupid God deal they have to throw in there it actually might be funnier if they would have left that whole scenario out of it. As soon as the chick gets the little God doesn't exist spiel she just starts throwing all normal morals out the window, making atheist look like imbeciles which I found disrespectful. Just because a person doesn't believe in a higher power doesn't mean they would just start drinking alcohol to their hearts content and start taking their clothes off for any person they meet. This movie may not have been rated the highest or considered one of the greats but it still sucks in too many ways to really give it the light of day, or night.",Paul
238,bozinovska_jovana,A different kind of alien movie that turned out to be awesome!,7,22 July 2013,"First, I feel like I need to say what I love the most about this movie: No matter how serious,dangerous,tense or emotional the situation the characters were in, there was always something funny to relieve that tension in the most hilarious way when you at least expect it. Simon Pegg and Nick Frost have already proved themselves in number of other comedy movies and I consider them one of the best duo of actors. This time, the set is different. They are English nerds in America who meet an alien. I like the fact that the makers of the movie didn't try to create an original alien, but stuck on the one who we've always known to recognize(there's actually an explanation about this in the movie by Paul which for me made a perfect sense). This movie may have started a little bit slow and not very promising, but I guarantee you that that's not the case. The whole movie is kind of a chase between all the characters and it has a great action in the ending. Also, be warned that a lot of swearing is used, but it doesn't sound so bad and rude. It's actually very funny. For me, this comedy had me very entertained and it kept surprising me. Definitely one of the best comedy movies that appeared in the last few years.",Paul

I liked them in the cornetto trilogy and from then, trying to have a look at all of their work. Boy, they can give you a good laugh. I think the director did a pretty good job. References to other films like Star wars and aliens gave me a chuckle. The screenplay is captivating, visuals are great, comedy is fantastic. Good job on writing the story by Mr. Pegg and Mr. Frost. If I had known about this film when it was released, I definitely would have watched in theater. A pretty good Nerd film if I can say. Trust me, if you are a bit nerdy like me, you are gonna love it. Even if nerd movies are not your cup of tea, this movie is not gonna disappoint you. 10 rating for all the fun and entertainment.",Paul
240,stubs182,"Zombies, Cops and Aliens",9,17 February 2011,"Take your typical male movie fan, ask them to make a list of their favourite genres and it might read a lot like this: Zombies, Buddy cop and Sci-Fi. Strikingly similar to the current track record of the ultimate fanboy duo Simon Pegg and Nick Frost. Exploding onto the big screen with Shaun of the Dead, an idea that was sparked during filming of the now legendary short lived TV series Spaced. Shaun made the duo household names and attracted attention from big time film makers notably Tarantino himself. However their next outing Hot Fuzz remained a wholly British affair, but now Pegg and Frost are going to the states with their latest film Paul. This is the first time that Pegg and Frost have written the script together however it is important to note that this is NOT the third instalment of the Blood and Ice Cream trilogy. Edgar Wright is not involved, directing duties have been handled by Superbad and Adventureland director Greg Mottola.Just as Shaun was a love letter to Romero and Hot Fuzz openly praised popcorn cop flicks Paul makes no bones about its influences, references are littered throughout the script, a few of which only die-hard Spielberg fans will pick up on. Paul also features an all star Hollywood cast, including Jason Bateman as the ice cool man in black pursuing the lovable nerds as they hightail it across the states with a certain illegal alien. The eponymous character Paul is voiced by Seth Rogen, having a completely CGI character as your lead is a risky move but Paul totally works. It comes off perfectly, the special effects team knocked it out of the park and it's easy to forget that what you're looking at is just a bunch of pixels but the mix of brilliant animation and Rogen's hilarious performance really make a connection. Often Rogen is type cast as the stereotypical, laid back, wise cracking stoner and this is no different only now he's an alien.The genre references and homage are a trademark of the Pegg and Frost films and they're once again present throughout Paul. They don't overdo it so as to alienate the more casual viewers but the work so well for the die-hard fans, like an in-side joke among friends the clever and subtle moments create a sensation not commonly found in other films. For a moment it presents a very clear connection with the audience, you sit there in your seat in the cinema and think 'They like that movie, I like that movie too!!' The cast now more 'Hollywood' than the previous films definitely add to the appeal however the driving force is definitely Paul, he steals the show and has lasting appeal .So much so that at the end of the movie all I could think was 'I pray to god they make a sequel to this'. Shaun and Fuzz whilst both brilliant in their own right, never captured me in the same way. I didn't want it to end.",Paul

I am actively awaiting for this to be released on DVD.Aliens are similar to robots in that we are superior to human mouth breathers. I appreciate this. The story follows two sci-fi geeks; Graeme Willy (Pegg) and Clive Gollings (Frost) on a road trip across America and its UFO hotspots. Inevitably they bump into an alien called Paul (Seth Rogen).. hilarity and urination ensue. Paul, their bagel consuming paranormal pal is on the run from federal agents and needs to return to his mothership. With the aid of a ditzy female human and an RV they help him escape. The characterisation of Paul is good, with impressive CGI.Sigourney Weaver an altogether acceptable actress makes a cameo appearance which is somewhat disappointing. Nevertheless you will be treated to a number of sci-fi references – ""Get away from her you bitch!"" My databanks matched them all of course. On the whole a good film for robots, sci-fi geeks and anyone with a sense of humour.",Paul

The sodomite overtone joke was a bit much as well. Frost and Pegg have done well in prior efforts so I suspected similar results. The buddy film formula with latent homosexual overtones seems to be working for them. The Comic Con scenes captured the real feeling of such nerd fests.The MIBS were well acted and deserve a spin off.....The Cameo of Mr, Big was nice as well as the call backs to other Sci Fi hits.

245,Hellsvien,The Modern E.T for adults,10,3 July 2014,"I saw the trailers for ""Paul"" a while back. Only recently I decided to watch it. When reading the description of the film I was interested because it was staring Nick Frost and Simon Pegg who are both actors I love to see. Paul is a film about an alien that crash lands onto a farm, killing a little girls dog in the process. Paul is then seized and taking to Area 51. Where is is made to feel like he is a guest and in safe hands. After all of his secrets are revealed to the government,they decide to cut out his brain to get his powers. Paul makes a daring escape by stealing a government car. He meets our main characters Graeme and Clive, two nerds from the UK who had come for their life long dream adventure. Who don't take to meeting an alien as well as they thought.Paul starts his great escape plan here. The story covers lots of adult humour, and even some emotional areas that could bring a tear to your eye. We are introduced to many other interesting characters throughout the film. Like all great films, there is a rather present twist at the end of the film. The way this film was directed, the music, the lighting included, made me feel really happy. I felt as if I had come along for the road trip myself, with me often laughing out loud.If you want a great adventure, with tears, laughter, and some adult humour, watch Paul. I highly recommend this film, so much that I wouldn't mind seeing a second follow up of this humorous alien friend.",Paul
246,stephen7455,Why is this movie anti-religion and pro-Evolution?,2,6 June 2014,"This is a pretty good question. Actual UFO communications do not support the sentiments promulgated in this movie:The Creator has sent people from outer space to guide Earthmen as they free themselves from darkness and bondage. These spacemen, in the name of the Infinite Father, will raise up men with eyes to see and ears to hear. This message is therefore proclaimed to all the inhabitants of the Earth. George Williamson, ""Other Tongues—Other Flesh"", p.129.and a smattering of some loose religious sentiments from this same book:Watch ... the sorrows of Earth ... the Father's authority ... His will ... worry not ... serve the Infinite Father. Pity ... love ... pray ... for they know not what they do ... ""OTOF"", p.516.George Williamson's book is loaded with UFO communications. And the above quotations show very clearly that not only are the UFO entities very religious, but that they believe in a supreme being who created the universe. However they do hold a curious view of Evolution.Their concept of Evolution appears to be a bit of a fruit salad:Evolution is a fact, but does not, however, as so many assume, teach that man is descended from an ape or monkey. ""OTOF"", p.242. Man, therefore, came from races of angels mixed with beasts, ... ""OTOF"", p.244.The UFO entities and the space people clearly do not believe in the evolution of mankind as such. They do appear to believe in some form of evolution of life from the Creation but not of mankind. Note: the Orion Confederation view is more in line with the religious group we support.And if the UFO entities actually believe that man did not evolve but had to be brought into existence by the interaction of angels then this is a completely different view to the general concept of evolution.So why the muddled views in the Paul movie?""Numerous scenes throughout the film deal with the controversy of Darwin and Evolution vs. Religion and Creationism, with the character of Paul the alien being the proverbial 'fly-in-the-ointment' of conservative Judeo-Christian doctrine. Simon Pegg and Nick Frost, who are atheists, have alluded in BBC Radio interviews they had wished to delve deeper into the controversy but cut several scenes short in favour of flow and timing on film."" Wikipedia.It appears that Simon Pegg and Nick Frost may very well be barking up the proverbial wrong tree with respect to their spiritual views and the UFO phenomenon.The movie should be viewed as entertainment, and not the truth. After all, these are the guys who gave us Shaun of the Dead. You should not be expecting a documentary with actual facts about these sorts of things.And if Simon and Nick want to delve deeper into this sort of controversy they may very well have to change their spiritual outlook a little!The low rating I am giving this movie is purely for the very questionable and inaccurate sentiments put forward in this comedy movie about space aliens and UFOs. And sure, for a comedy about UFOs and space aliens we would ordinarily not be worried about dead accurate information.But when the bulk of this comedy is at the expense of some people's religious beliefs and which also flies directly in the face of actual UFO communications then you have to start asking yourself just what is really going on here? Especially when the majority of people with strong religious views find this movie highly offensive and very unfunny, accuracy in these sorts of matters does become quite important!It is a curious thought to consider just how this movie may have turned out if Simon and Nick had been more aware of just how wrong they were in their understanding of the actual beliefs of the UFO entities and the space people. This movie would have taken a completely different direction!And some final thoughts on all of this...The above UFO communications are authentic. George Hunt Williamson received the majority of his communications for his book from these UFO entities through the use of a ouija-board. See Wikipedia. That should give some clue as the the actual identity of these so-called UFO entities. Nevertheless the communications can be accepted as authentic from them and show that these UFO entities actually believe in a supreme being who created the universe.So the only atheists in the entire universe live on this planet. Watching this movie. Mocking Christians who believe in God. While the actual UFO entities portrayed in this movie really do believe in a supreme being who created the universe.That's laughable.This movie is so messed up!!Stephen Orion Confederation memberReferencesGeorge Hunt Williamson, ""Other Tongues—Other Flesh"", 1953, Amherst Press: Amherst, Wisconsin. The pagination given here is for the epub version I have and is very approximate.*John Keel, well known UFO investigator and Fortean, referred to these entities more correctly as ultraterrestrials after he rejected the extraterrestrial hypothesis.

247,TheFewSick,A loving tribute to the original Star Wars kids.,7,21 March 2011,"This vulgar little science fiction comedy was written by the two lovable hetero-lifemate leads of Hot Fuzz and Shaun of the Dead and directed by Superbad's Gregg Mottola. The film pays adoring tribute to those of us that grew up in the 70's and 80's enthralled by the fantastical works of Steven Spielberg and George Lucas. While the film may not live up to the hype and hysteria of the aforementioned titles it holds a certain warm charm throughout that had me feeling as though I'd written the film on a drunken night with friends recalling the 'what-ifs' of my elementary years. I was surprised by certain content in the film that I felt took a bold step; specifically, our Seth Rogan voiced, foul-mouthed alien friend disproving God and creation by 'healing' a fundamentalist Christian and exclaiming tenaciously that he couldn't understand how we (atheists?) put up with them. The inside jokes and nods to former sci-fi films were done with careless abandon but fun and humorous nonetheless. One moment that had me laughing uncontrollably has Paul inside a suspiciously familiar warehouse while playing technical adviser to a 'Mr. Spielberg' on the inner workings of alien technology.Don't go into this film expecting a laugh-a-minute comedy on par with Superbad or anticipate something akin to other films starring Simon Pegg and Nick Frost. Paul is more along the lines of brainless (alien) fart humor such as Tenacious D in the Pick of Destiny or Jay and Silent Bob Strike Back before their age-afflicted cult status. I enjoyed Paul with my brain on auto-pilot or perhaps it was my inner man-child nerdiness, but if you've ever been to the San Diego Comic-Con you will feel an awkward affection towards this film not unlike Richard Dreyfus to Devil's Tower.",Paul

A nice little flick from the guys that brought us some amazing films this past decade, Superbad, Shaun of the dead, Adventureland, Hot Fuzz, and so on. Needless to say, i wasn't expecting a terrible movie at all. Always, i will have faith in these guys. Paul is basically a Road-trip/Extra-terrestrial sci-fi action flick, and a well made one at that. In this film we follow two British nerds who venture to America for the beloved Comic-Con, and a nice road trip down to Area 51. Everything is fine, until an alien that goes by the name of 'Paul' crashes in front of their R.V.. The two geeks agree to give Paul a ride to his destination.

255,q32modulate,Such a disappointment...,2,11 July 2011,"I've never written a review on here but after viewing 'Paul', I woke up feeling... compelled. Hot Fuzz is one of my favorite movies and I've enjoyed everything that Pegg and Frost have done from Spaced forward. Pegg's other roles without Frost have been enjoyable including MI III and Star Trek. Given the subject matter, I figured Paul would have to be brilliant.I was so wrong.The main two characters, Clive and Graham lack any and all... character. They're not likable or unlikeable. Conflicts between the two aren't believable or interesting. The dialogue is slow, sparse and the antithesis of witty. The plot mines every cliché movie device, shot, sequence and conversation ever used. While their spoof of action movie sequences was tight and seamless in HF, it is just pathetic here. The foreshadowing is ham-handed overkill and surges into the ridiculous at every corner. You can guess every plot twist 10 minutes before it happens. You know what each character is going to say, word for word, before they say it. If a movie can't keep you guessing to some extent, it is a waste of time.The main character Paul is simply Seth Rogan being Seth Rogan. Which works well in Superbad and Knocked Up but falls very short in films like this (and the Green Hornet which is equally terrible). You never believe Paul is anything but Rogen.Jason Bateman and the very lovely Blythe Danner turn in solid performances but they are alone in the universe of this movie. Kristen Wiig did the best she could but her character was so predictable and poorly written she might as well have not been there. Jane Lynch's talents are totally wasted as are those by Hader, Lo Truglio, Koechner, Tambor and everyone else in the movie. Which is why I found it so disappointing in the end; with so much talent, how could this movie go so far wrong? Younger audiences would find it entertaining but it is oddly not suitable for them either. The cute alien with fart jokes theme is interrupted too often by swearing, smoking, violence and adult themes to be suitable for them. At the same time, none of these aspects are explored deep enough for adult audiences. This movie is guilty of muddling in the middle. It has an air of laziness to it.I was tempted to shut this off about halfway through the movie because I knew everything that was going to happen. But I stuck it out to the end hoping that the boys would pull off something good for the finale. I should have shut it off. There are no surprises in this movie. The characters are all uninteresting, unbelievable and completely forgettable. I hope Frost and Pegg return to sharper projects in the future. Other reviews I've read seem to want to cut them slack because they are generally talented and great guys who have turned out some of the most enjoyable cinema out there. I can't be so forgiving. They wasted a prime vehicle here. Better luck next time fellas.",Paul
256,mxs157,One of the worst movies that we watched!,1,3 April 2011,"We got fooled by the IMDb rating (7.4 so far) and went to see a funny and interesting movie. Got so disappointed of that and we don't want anyone else experience it. No story , no real story behind it. Just full of foul language that might not even make sense to use. My guess is this is for individual male adults and with certain mind stream. It was a waste of our time!!!!!!!!!! Don't go to this movie to expect a nice sci-fi movie because it is not. It is just full of gibberish and cussing that does not make any sense at all. It is so bad that there are a few talented actors and actresses have been wasted on this movie. and I have no clue where in the hell!!! the rating of 7.4 came from. I hope a little bit later, the rating goes low enough that people get some clues about the content and value of this stupid movie.",Paul
257,danielbardem,Falls into the same traps as many other like-minded comedies,5,17 June 2011,"Paul is the starchild of Simon Pegg and Nick Frost. Throughout their Hot Fuzz's and Shaun of the Dead's it was clear that Paul is exactly the kind of movie they've always wanted to make. It's a genre savvy comedy with a cesspool of in-jokes and self-referential humour, just like their previous two, but this time on the genre of sci-fi. Considering how good their last two collaborations were and knowing how geeky these guys are over this stuff, It was reasonable to assume this to be their magnum opus- as they say. But the end result was very surprising.Pegg and Frost are these two sci-fi nerds from England who go on a road trip around the US, starting at Comic Con then making their way through all the famous UFO related destinations. These are also the characters they play in the movie. Clive (Frost) is the lovable fool and Graeme (Pegg) is the slightly more serious one, but they need a comic relief so they run into Paul (voiced by Seth Rogen) a CG stoner alien on the run from his holding facility. They witness Paul's car become trashed beyond repair so they reluctantly let him aboard their RV and agree to take him to an as of yet unspecified location. But Paul's escape has spurred the FBI into action and the group finds themselves being tracked by Special Agent Loreno Zoil (Jason Bateman) and subsequently two bumbling- and sci-fi loving-FBI Agents, who become curious about the case after meeting the RV at a roadblock. The rest of the movie follows the occupants of the RV as they awkwardly and hi-lariously get to know each other over the course of the chase.From the outset it's clear that the plot is pretty standard fair and it's clear where it's going, but the character of Paul expands the movies possibilities for comedy greatly. Most of the humour comes from the paradoxical mundane-ity of Paul. He's a highly advanced alien life form but he just acts like, well, Seth Rogen. An example of this is when he first comes aboard the guys RV and they're both rendered speechless by the presence of an alien, Paul starts making banal small talk whilst putting the kettle on and eating some bagels. When confronted by the conventions of alien movies and assumptions people make about him being an alien he dismisses them as ignorant stereotypes, taking time to directly reference countless other sci-fi in his rants. Even when he does do something superhuman he still passes it off as nothing special. His nature and character are the biggest draw of the movie. It's refreshing to have a character who openly rejects and mocks the standards other genre movies. Thankfully, in this regard, it also never reaches the level of pretentiousness of the Scream movies or Last Action Hero as well. The other characters amply follow the appeal of the main character. Frost and Pegg almost take the sideline in their own movie but their camaraderie and naivety allow for some good dialogue and situations. Bateman pulls off the stern secret agent plausibly and his two inept colleagues can be enjoyable to watch.Ironically despite how initially open they are with their rejection of sci-fi tropes and stereotypes they start to collapse back onto them once the plot starts to develop. It starts to drag after it starts playing the schmaltz it so enthusiastically renounced, surprisingly seriously. Not long into their road trip the group picks up another member whose sole purpose is to consistently exaggerate the superhuman messiah-like aspects of Paul. The tone changes drastically from the Edgar Wright-esque analysis and subversion of science fiction tropes to the straight out embracing of them. The off-beat humour that dominated the first half of the film are still present throughout, but the humour too often comes to a grinding halt whenever it starts soberly spouting it's half baked philosophies. The further in the movie gets the more humour it loses until it's climax- aside from an admittedly great cameo- is almost devoid of laughs. With such a promising concept it's a shame that they weren't confident enough in their own ideas.Paul is a worthwhile comedy with some memorable gags, talented actors and an intriguing concept. Fans of sci-fi in particular will get a lot out of Paul's reservoir of in-jokes and references. Unfortunately, however, the underwhelming second and third acts do little to explore the potential that it's unique premise offers.",Paul
258,actiondallas,"Eh, worth watchin' but not anything exceptional....",7,19 March 2011,"Shaun of the Dead and especially Hot Fuzz are two great movies. Hot Fuzz has great special effects with solid acting and a good script that is well directed, Paul is not lacking in special effects and Seth Rogen as Paul was enough to make it worth watching, but in other areas such as story and real laugh out loudedness it lacks. It is surelyyy no Superbad, so expect nothing more than a pretty entertaining, whacky good time. I would wait for DVD. I would have rather seen a number of the other movies in theaters now than spend the time and money on this one.

262,TwentyCamels,Painfully unfunny and horribly unoriginal,2,20 February 2011,"The thing about Spaced, Shaun, and Hot Fuzz is that they are actually funny. They are well written, energetically performed, and knowingly well-read in the medium of pop culture. PAUL sadly, does not fall into any of those categories, and the absence of Edgar Wright is quite palpable. In a nutshell, it's an incredibly lame plot, with tired, forced performances from Pegg and Frost doing a watered down version of their double act. A substantial amount of the humour is taken up with two running 'gags', namely a comic cover featuring an alien with three tits, and people mistaking them for being gay, because they are two men travelling together in an RV. Get it?? I'll pause so you can finish laughing.Famous lines from popular scifi films are lifted in their entirety and used to fill gaps in the script (Seriously lads, this whole geek-chic thing is really past it's use-by date now), kristen wiig appears to deploy none of her comedic talents whatsoever beyond uttering profanities, and the film dedicates itself throughout to making patronising, superior swipes at religion, portraying it in a ludicrously simplistic light. Don't get me wrong, I'm no churchgoer or bible basher myself, it just felt a little mean is all.The titular alien does have a couple of good lines, and comedy stalwart Jason Bateman is on top form and a sheer pleasure to watch as ever, the rest of it though is an uphill struggle of weak set pieces, uninspired dialogue, nutshots, and a cringingly bad first-toke-on-a-joint scene.Just...put the American mainstream down guys, and get on with The World's End.",Paul

Since everyone else has gone over the plot, I won't bother (BTW, the ""three tits"" gag is supposed to be a running one...Think ""you've got red on you"" from Shaun) except to say the in-jokes really are fantastic. Like another reviewer here, sometimes I was the only one laughing - It makes you feel a bit loony! The genuine warmth and sweetness of Paul makes up for the slightly crude humour, he's no ET - But I defy anyone to dislike him. I'm not a fan of Seth Rogan at all, but I don't agree that he was a mistake in casting. I found him quite pleasant to listen to! Simon and Nick are unsurpassable as always, Ms Wiig I admit I found mildly annoying but she has some funny lines, and the plot trots along nicely - Look out for the line when Graeme is drawing Paul. I nearly choked on my popcorn XDRude, crude, adorable, sweet - Well worth seeing. I'll be first in line for the sequel (provided Simon and Nick are writing). And I want to take Paul home!",Paul
264,Ben-Mariscal-937-155436,Great Sci-Fi Comedy with hilarious Jokes and Genius references,10,2 March 2014,"Paul is a film about two English friend; Sci-fi writer Clive Gollings (Frost) and Graeme Willy (Pegg), Who are Sci-Fi Geeks who go to Comic con (And meet a rather impatient writer) and go on a road trip to visit famous UFO hotspots such as Area 51, The blackmail box and many other spots from UFO lore and also encounter two threatening rednecks at a local bar.

266,serennishiyama,"Unexpectedly, it was complete Tripe.",1,12 October 2011,"From the start let me say that I have loved Frost and Pegg's previous offerings. They were actually funny. This was puerile garbage, the sole purpose of which seemed to arrogantly mock religion. They didn't even bother to be clever about it; it was just one long hate-on for anyone who doesn't agree with their rigid ideology. The first thing you need to mock religion is apparently a tired stereotype: the maniac-retard-redneck who is completely irrational and shuns all things scientific. Check. We have our straw-man, or straw- woman, that is easily mocked and knocked down. Second, we need a wise-cracking evolutionist alien who knows better than everyone else because the writers created their universe that way. Yawn. I find it most humorous that in a real debate of scientific fact these same writers would be bewildered, but in the safety of the universe of their own opinion they REQUIRE the Deus-Ex Machina of the alien ""Paul"" to champion their pro-evolution ideology; which he does not by rationality, but by his magical alien touch that convinces you he is right, and that the universe is a pointless, chaotic, jumble of meaninglessness. Oh yeah, and he can work healing miracles with a touch as well. Who needs religion when the writers have crafted their own replacement for it so effortlessly? Seriously, this movie isn't the fun- filled buddy-movie romp it was purported to be. It's just a 97 minute long unfunny waste of time in which blind intolerance and stomach- churning arrogance are the order of the day.",Paul

I was presently surprised at how funny it was. As much as I am already tired of Seth Rogen, I thought he was a really great choice as the voice of Paul. Simon Pegg and Nick Frost were also a good choice for this movie. The only thing that really turned me off about the movie was it's agenda. Throughout the movie, the writers continually portray Christians as sensational, ridiculous idiots and heavily promote science. I suppose maybe I shouldn't expect a lot different from a sci-fi comedy, but it irritated me. I feel that the movie was funny, but nowhere near ""Hangover"" funny. It's in the category of movies that will be continually shown on Comedy Central in 2-3 years, much like Shaun of the Dead and Super Troopers. I give it a 7.",Paul

This one is not quit in the same league, but still pretty good. As always, Pegg and Frost excel in portraying lovable goons, realistic to the point of cringing. At first glance the film seems to be aimed at the American market, but its not without a bite. It refuses to take the safe road and makes good fun of American preoccupation with UFO's, anal probing and faith. It boldly, bluntly and rather hilariously attacks Christianity repeatedly. It is also packed with references to the classics and pays homage to nerds and geeks, while parodying them at the same time, lovingly but viciously.This really is one for the nerds. If you liked Galaxy Quest and are not offended by jokes at precious beliefs, this is definitely one to watch. If you do, pay attention to the T-shirt the Christian girl wears the first time she enters the screen. I laughed my head of.",Paul

Don't expect an amazing story, but expect the very essence of a good movie - awesome characters and a hell of a time with them. The best part about the movie is how Paul is so obnoxious, lovable, crazy, irritable, ugly and yet so gentle and wise. A tough combo to pull off - that mix of traits.Paul is probably the best animated character I have seen yet - in terms of the depth of expression and body language captured. Yes it is animated and it is an alien movie, but don't bring your kids - it is a treasure trove of swear words and is just not suitable for kids - a pity really.So, if you want to kickback for the weekend and have a lot of laughs, rent it out or hit the theaters, you will not regret it.",Paul

The Christian Creationist woman was a nice touch in the story. If you are looking for a X-Files type story then this is not it. This is more of a ""Hey dude where is my car"" sort of thing with an alien thrown in for good measure. At least that is the way I see it.

273,eddie_pedro,Hot Fuzz > Paul > Shaun of the Dead,7,26 March 2011,"Paul Director: Greg Mottola (Superbad; Adventureland) Genre: Sci-Fi; Comedy; Adventure The film begins with Graeme (Simon Pegg) and Clive (Nick Frost) attending Comic-Con on their way to visiting all of the best sci-fi sites in the US. On the way they witness a car crashing off the side of the road, when they investigate they find an alien named Paul (Seth Rogan) who is on the run from the Government, what ensues is a road trip across America while being chased by three agents (Jason Bateman, Bill Hader and Joe Lo Truglio).After watching Greg Mottola's last two films (Superbad and Adventureland) I was not sure what to think, as Superbad was often funny but more often stepped over the line separating funny and vulgar, while Adventureland was a lot more serious with a moral plot running through it. So I wasn't sure whether this would be overly vulgar or a bit more serious. However to my surprise Paul was slap bang in the middle, it very rarely went overly vulgar while the story remained relatively serious throughout.Simon Pegg and Nick Frost are on top form here with their brilliant chemistry and great writing, what I liked about the script was that Graeme and Clive aren't ""Hollywood British"" (tea drinking, bowler hat wearing posh folk) this is because Simon and Nick are British and know what British people act like.If I can pick out one thing about Paul which I didn't like, it would be the swearing (or ""cursing""). I don't mind swearing in films when it is in context or realistic, but when Ruth (Kristen Wiig) starts swearing it seems a bit unmotivated and overly stupid. Paul's swearing though (most of the time) is natural and realistic.Paul is a very entertaining film, with a lot of very memorable scenes and characters.For fans of: Dumb and Dumber; Shaun of the Dead Rating: 7/10",Paul

I do have one question however, why is it whenever religious people are shown in movies they are always made out to be way over the top and crazy, almost cult like?

I've also learned all about the facts of evolution at the Christian schools I attended. Just about every Christian I know thinks that the vastness of space inevitably contains extraterrestrial life. This is not at all incompatible with faith. It would have made just as much since if she had turned athiest on the sight of a vacuum or cheeseburger. I'm not sure why the writers of this movie thought that Christians would lose faith upon encountering extraterrestrial life. It comes across as forced and ignorant. It's an otherwise fine film.

Too much to make it funny for any one over the age of twelve. As Paul told Ruth when she first learned to curse, you must use it sparingly, and at the right time (to paraphrase). Profanity was used too much in this movie. I was not offended, but bored by it. It would have been a movie targeted for the older audience if the profanity was used sparingly. I am not shocked or tickled by the F bomb or potty humor, or references to gays or penises. However, the appearance of veteran actors, Sigourney Weaver, Jane Lynch, Jeffery Tambor and Blythe Danner was a delightful and funny surprise. Seth Grogan was brilliant as Paul.

For a lot of jokes I wanted to to carry on and 'finish it off' - follow the joke to its cruller, harsher, ruder, British end. So, how was this ""British American"" comedy? I enjoyed it. If found funny but too long whereas this was about right. The jokes were constant, and I left the cinema happy to recommend the film to friends.So... yep, I'd recommend you to go and see this film - you'll leave the Cinema with a happy grin, although maybe not aching from laughter.",Paul

286,rragona-1,"Now this, my friends, is one hilarious film",10,23 March 2011,"Saw this at an early matinée showing yesterday and had the theater to myself--and I was glad, because hardly a minute would go by without me whooping out loud with laughter. Having enjoyed both ""Shaun of the Dead"" and ""Super Fuzz"", I went into this with high expectations, and wasn't disappointed one bit. Be advised: there is no ""deep meaning"" to find here, this is just a fun film, and you shouldn't go in expecting anything other.Pegg and Frost are an excellent comedy duo and Rogen--whom I can usually take or leave--really brought Paul's character to life; he was an alien but easy to relate to, with his deadpan sense of humor. Jason Bateman does a surprisingly formidable turn as Agent Zoil, a man seemingly without emotions as he relentlessly pursues Paul, aided (and often frustrated) by a pair of rookie agents that would do Abbott and Costello proud (and owing to their look, were probably modeled on that). Beyond the funny were some moving moments and a pair of twists at the end that were ""Holy cow, cool!"" moments for me.Definitely a film worth seeing, and even owning.",Paul
287,gooner1974,Not quite out of this world.........,5,22 June 2011,"'Paul' had the premise of becoming a clever and witty mockery against the sci-fi genre loved by both Simon Pegg & Nick Frost, but unfortunately didn't quite live up to it. It's hard not to compare this with the highly enjoyable Shaun of the Dead and Hot Fuzz but what it became, sadly, is a weak story line designed for the American mainstream audiences lacking the cleverness in the script for it to become on par with pairs previous acting outings.The story is all too familiar - E.T. for adults come to mind but without any real imagination to the back story of Paul. On a personal level I wanted the character of Paul to be more like the Alien depicted in the 'Destroy All Humans' video games - very funny, very cheeky and a little more evil!! Paul was trying to be this but for me was too nice, a more out of control and unpredictable 'Paul' would of been a little bit more interesting.Hot Fuzz & Shaun of the Dead are films, in my view, you can watch again and pick up gags that may not have been noticed before and laugh out loud, sadly Paul, at best, is a smile or a chuckle, and certainly a film I could easily forget.5 at best from me.",Paul

Didn't really know anything about the movie before I've seen it and it turned out to be pretty unique. I mean a religion-bashing comedy with a couple of geeks, an alien and explosions? Slap me with a donkey beard.I bet you will have fun watching this; even if it's not your cup of tea, you'll still have a couple of chuckles at the very least. The plot is surprisingly good (unlike what you'd expect in a comedy), now add pro-class acting and an awesome CGI alien with super cute eyes and you got a super fun times guarantee.",Paul

Could have. Prepare to be underwhelmed by everything except Jason Bateman who puts in his usual solid performance. Most of the gags fall flat, and the two human male leads are pretty much the same person.Film makers and stars Nick Frost and Simon Pegg have done some great work, but this time they have spent forty million dollars on mediocrity.Paul is an alien trying to get home who smokes killer weed, advises Hollywood producers, and converts born again Christians to Darwinism by injecting the full history of Earth's evolution into their minds in an instant. Sounds funny here, right? But Pegg and Frost's lame characters function to take the edge off the humour.And Seth Rogen as the voice of Paul? Funny guy of course, but even he can't fix such an undercooked movie.",Paul

It star the British comedy heroes Simon pegg and nick frost and Seth rogen as the voice of the alien. Sometimes the humour was dry and didn't suit the feel of the film but there is a joke a minute and so many reference. When i saw it the audience where laughing every second. If you Spaced, or any judd apatow movie then this is for you. With the best ending i have ever seen in a movie and a uber brilliant cast. There is some hilarious performances from Bill Hader and David Koechner as well 9/10 for Comedy",Paul
291,mikefurtaw,Could Have Been a Great Geek Movie,6,22 August 2011,"While I have enjoyed some of Simon Pegg and Nick Frost's previous films, this one was a bit of a letdown, and quite frankly a bit insulting. This film started off on the right foot, about two sci-fi geeks from Britain on a vacation to the US to visit ComicCon and then pursue a road trip to visit the famous alien siting locations of the southwest. As a sci-fi geek myself, I enjoyed the subtle and not so subtle references to classics such as Star Trek and Star Wars mixed in with the British sense of humor.Shortly into their road trip, they encounter an alien named Paul (voiced by Seth Rogen) who is in the process of escaping 60 years of imprisonment at a secret military base. At this point in the film, the geeky British humor becomes offset by the typical overly vulgar humor seen in many of today's American films. While I am sure the director and writers were aiming for shock value, this over-the-top vulgarity is nowadays over-done, and in my opinion, not very creative.The film also hit a pet peeve of mine: if evolution is true, then God can't exist. While there are some modern Christian groups who believe in young earth Creationism, to most of the older Christian groups such as Catholics, Lutherans, etc. creationism is not dogma. In fact, many of the greatest scientists in relation to Astronomy, Genetics, and Geology were Catholics (i.e. Copernicus, Gregor Mendel, Nicolas Steno, Georges Lemaître, and yes, even Galileo). To generalize all of Christians based on something the majority don't even hold true is insulting and ignorant.If the movie kept with the geeky and British style of humor, and dropped the uncreative use of vulgarity and unnecessary and inaccurate generalization of Christians, this could have been up there with Hot Fuzz and Shaun of the Dead.",Paul
292,cat_funkychick,Pegg and Frost strike again!,9,25 February 2011,"Simon Pegg and Nick Frost have reunited for this comedy bonanza that shook up the states. Think of all the brilliance of 'Hot Fuzz' with a dash of sci-fi and even a bit of 'Shaun of the Dead' goriness for good measure - this film has it all.The story starts when two comic nerds, touring America for some whacky comic binge, find a manifestation of all their geekiest desires - an alien, who goes by the name of Paul. This alien is on the run from some (cue corny American accent) top-secret government military base. When the two geeks agree to help Paul, the fun really begins - be prepared to wee your pants.Overall, it is the eclectic mix of all film genres jam packed into one that makes this film so successful. After all, there aren't many films that juggle 'James Bond' action with that nostalgic 'ET go home' feel, oh and of course include a woman with one eye. For a diverse mix of friends who tend to argue about which films to see and end up sitting in different theatres, this could be for you.Most of the humour is spot on in 'Paul', with faultless timings and the infamous chemistry between Pegg and Frost perfecting each gag. However, for fellow girls, some of the humour is a bit boyish. Whilst the seventeen year old boy next to you chokes on his popcorn in hysterics however, I suppose you can have a good laugh at him. Though these gags are few and far between.With a great cast and sticking true to the great British humour, Pegg and Frost have done well with this film. Even if sci-fi isn't your thing, this is certainly a must-see just so you can have some common ground with all those who will be endlessly quoting this film until the cows come home. Although not the sharpest probe in the duo's toolbox, this film certainly proves a feel-good film, appealing to everyone's inner geek.",Paul
293,X-XNadzX-X526,a great watch,9,17 February 2011,"i went to see Paul on valentines day and i'l admit i thoroughly enjoyed it. Unmistakably one of the best films of 2011 so far. it has a lot of the regular humour but offers some new comedy in the form of PAUL. The reunion of Simon and Nick goes really well with the new addition of Paul and the acting ability does not disappoint, they are still as admirable as they were from the very beginning. Another good point is the addition of using Paul as our main source of Sci-Fi, this was very clever and there is no lag in the storyline which kept me more intrigued and glued to my chair. As a fan of SOTD and HF i couldn't wait to go see this, and am proud to say that it was well worth the wait and value for my money. not a film to be missed and cannot wait for the DVD release to come out so i can watch it again.",Paul

Maybe I'm just easily impressed when it comes to films, even though this film just like any other film has predictable moments with gags that have been done many times before I still found it to be a very entertaining and at some parts Laugh out loud film! A lot of the jokes revolve around the comic book type era, and space references related to Star Trek etc, with a few little references from their previous films. Even though the two main actors are British, the humour is both British and American orientated so I'm sure there won't be many moments where you're just sat there wondering if certain parts were meant to be funny or not. Obviously if you're a fan of these two and even Seth Rogen's movies; you won't be disappointed watching this film, with a few cameo appearance from familiar actors/actresses.",Paul

I love the chemistry that Pegg and Frost have in all their films including this one - their brilliant together and I for one hope to see their partnership for many years to come. I love this film and will most certainly be seeing it again in the theater and I prefer to grade each movie rather than give it a star rating or a decimal rating so for me Paul is a classic (B) film filled with hilarious jokes, talented cast and a good story - Highly recommended",Paul

Paul is a character that will grow on you and you can really learn to love him. And pairing him up with the guys from Shaun of the Dead and Hot Fuzz just adds to the fun of the movie. All the characters in the movie are easily combined to create a fun and lovable cast.

Keep in mind that it is 'adult humor', swearing, sexual references etc. so not suitable for the kiddies.The story line isn't the most original I have seen but there were enough twists and turns to keep you interested until the very end, including the mini-clip during the credits. The special effects are fantastic, high speed chases, guns, secret government officials and aliens.

300,mattrobhowes,Very disappointing,1,7 September 2011,"I like Pegg and Frost movies but this one seems to have been given the Hollywood treatment by someone who does not understand why their other movies were so funny. There are a few laughs but this film fails because it tries to be too much at once. The director doesn't seem to know whether he wants this to be a teen gross out comedy, road movie, children's family comedy or critique of Christianity. Having tried and failed at all these elements there is no time to get to know the characters enough to make them believable or to fully exploit the idea of a comedy alien. Rather than being placed in funny situations Paul the alien seems to exist purely to lecture us in an unsubtle way about how idiotic Christians are. If you are aiming at satire fine but not in a movie marketed as light comedy. Since when did it become acceptable to lecture people during a comedy film?",Paul
301,tymdzien,"Weak & uninventive bore, that's heavy on anti-Christian bashing..",1,23 September 2012,"Er, what is this movie? What stands out to everyone should be it's prominent theme; Christian bashing.A couple of nerds attend comic con, then bump into an alien on the run, who they befriend & help out. An especially Hicksville Daughter & Father are introduced not long after, so we can all laugh at their stupid beliefs, with the Alien Paul & his abilities, being used as a way to mock them throughout. I wonder if they were coerced into setting the story up this way? It is clearly the main theme & follows Hollywood's favourite movie subtext (see Prometheus also - another similar snore fest, with lead Christian female character, being mocked at every turn). Don't get me wrong I am not religious, but movies with this overriding theme, become instantaneously very dull to me. It's funny how no-one will dare to mock Islam (Frost & Pegg would be on trial if they had), but with Christianity anything goes. To make it the subtext of a 'comedy' is odd, to say the least.I am very pleased I paid no money towards this film, as I borrowed a mates DVD (why the heck he purchased it, I don't know). I looked online to see what others felt about the anti religion (specifically Christian) theme. I found something very interesting & was going to post a section here, but the guidelines say the review has to be all my own original work.This isn't much of a review I know, but frankly the comedy & plot is not really worth mentioning. Some laughs but not many, & I just wonder what makes people rate this so highly. My mark of 1 is a response to the high rating it currently has. I'd give it 4/10 in reality, if I forget the childish arrogance of Frost & Pegg's story. They are way off-form with this one & have really gone down in my estimation. Trying to disguise anti Christian rhetoric as light comedy. Leave it out will you? Seen it all before. So, why did they feel the need to do it? Clearly they were lacking in any original ideas for this one... Or maybe it just wouldn't have been made, if it had been any other way?",Paul

I'd like to hear from the director in the future, even though I couldn't watch Superbad to the end (It gained some good critic). Maybe it was due to poor quality of my version of the film.

Leave it to Hollywood to promote something this evil and one sided. The actors look as if they have never bathed and the alien in the movie is crude,disgusting,offensive.

They made this alien jesus. He heals the blind and brings back the dead. He also gives you knowledge with a touch. He mentions eye for an eye, which jesus was asked about. Jesus' response was for us to turn the other cheek.

Not sure if this was to be a true comedy or a weak attempt at satire focusing on ET and other early space alien movies. The movie starts off promising with Comic Con and a few good laughs at nerdy stereotypes. Then jumps into a few typical jokes of laughs at homosexuals and straights but falls very flat. Then the movie tries very weakly to make a statement on religion and then continues into a mishmash of tripe.

Parodying religion can be funny, but if I want to see a movie making fun of religion, I'll go see ""Life of Brian"". Don't give it to me kindergarten teacher style in a comedy about an alien, a boring alien named Paul played by Seth Rogan who reads the script like he's reading an instruction manual for a lawn mower.

313,mindtrix69,Not just for the geeks,10,16 March 2011,"I went to see Paul on Valentines day with my partner (as it seems did the rest of the audience). The film itself was really funny throughout with Pegg and Frost delivering their usual ""best pal"" screen chemistry which they are now well known for. I was a little apprehensive about Seth Rogan's voice in the trailers but these fears were proved completely unjustified very early on. Overall the movie is fantastic, It's not gonna change your life but it will make you laugh out loud for it's entirety.The one drawback to this movie is the geeky references, This is in no way a criticism and was not at all detrimental to my own enjoyment of the film but some people, particularly those less in to their Science Fiction movies may struggle with some of the nods, homages and one liners that populate this flick. Often a line in the film would be followed by a muttering from the male half of the audience followed by an ""ah"" from the female side.That said, my partner is certainly never going to win at Star Wars Trivial Pursuit but did still really enjoy this movie as will anyone who has enjoyed Pegg and Frosts previous outings or likes their humour to have been written by an intelligent life form.

It does help if you are a Sci-Fi fan. I found the film very funny whilst my wife just enjoyed it. Pegg and Frost managed to pack in loads of subtle and not so subtle references to other Sci-Fi films without using the too often used ""Cyclist in front of Moon"" scene.

I have had complete faith in Nick and Simon to deliver a fantastic, funny script, and they delivered.The film revolves around two British comic book nerds, Clive and Graeme, who venture out to Comic Con in a nerd mecca-style pilgrimage. They plan to tour the US and visit their favourite sci-fi related places, from the scene of the fight between the lizard and Kirk in Star Trek, to Area 51. However, chaos erupts when the couple gain a hitchhiker, an alien who has adopted the name Paul. The film then becomes a race to get Paul home, whilst being pursued by the FBI, two bumbling officers and an angry Christian redneck father. Hilarity follows.The script is, for the most part, tight, however it does drag a bit in some parts. The gags are all very nerd-orientated, so if that's not your thing I'd give this a miss. Paul is a weed-smoking, potty mouthed alien who's content is NOT suitable for young kids, so don't let the misleading trailers fool you. If you're fans of Spaced, Hot Fuzz, Shaun of the Dead or Arrested Development, this is the movie for you. You should win a prize for spotting all of the sci-fi references in this.So to conclude, a must-see for any sci-fi fan or nerd on the planet, Paul is a movie that will shoot your humour receptors into orbit.

316,len-179,Brill' film - but is it for the kids?,10,20 February 2011,"What an absolutely superb film. Well written, cast and shot. Thoroughly enjoyed it, watching it with wife and chums.However, the film is rated 15, and with an 11yr old daughter who was desperate to see this film (a trailer was screened with Tangled, a PG) she wasn't able to go and see it. So when it comes out on DVD/BluRay would I let her watch it? I'd have to say yes - and not because I'm under immense pressure from her either ;-) I'll not give the film away, but there is a vast bucket load of swearing in it - but it's all in a very funny context and not at all aggressive or intimidating. There is no nudity that I could spot, there are one or two scantily clad women, but nothing more revealing than you'd see on, say, Star Wars. There are a couple of deaths in the film, some drug use, and the thorny subject of religion is challenged (and then stamped on).So if any of these things have you worried, watch it first and you decide. Personally, I think the rating should be a 12. By that age they should know and understand what they see and hear, and the difference between right and wrong.Thoroughly enjoyed the film, highly recommend it.You chaps on the certification board - get real ;-)",Paul
317,mkburk,very funny ---- but,7,23 February 2011,"I'm from a different time era and have been a fan of movies for a lifetime. I found 'Paul' to be very funny and the actors Simon Pegg and Nick Frost very appealing, but can anyone tell me what is so funny about vulgar language?? I hate to be an old fuddy-duddy, and the bits in between the 'language' were great but are we all 10 years old that we have to be subjected to an over-abundance of the 'F' word repeated again and again in order to get a snigger?? And is this movie not aimed at the younger generation, who we should be guiding, surely?? Along with this, there are seemingly endless schoolboy references to genitalia and sexual orientations, etc.? Are the seemingly talented writers so limited?? I admit that there are certain times when a vulgar word can be genuinely funny, but in general, swearing and cussing is simply insulting. There seems to be very few comedians today who can get by without 'F'-ing out of them at some point. Does this mean that comedy now has to depend on being vulgar and insulting in order to be what used to be called 'Funny' ?? As I said, the situation of the movie was very funny in itself, but it was apparently still necessary to have everyone have a goodly supply of verbal abuse. The older classic movie comedies just didn't need it. But of course they would not be considered 'cool' today. I was especially surprised at the heroine having such a script. Sorry folks, I loved the movie generally but not the language, and if comedy is to be based on vulgarity and swearing, then that's just sad.",Paul

As the film progresses the comedy stays the same and the characters don't build up as much as you would have thought. This doesn't however reduce its value for a comedy film because the characters stand reasonably strong at the start and the comedy fits the personalities of the characters well. It stays on its toes and has a nice ironic feel to some of the conspiracies that Area 51 could hold.I think this film stood ground well and had a surprisingly tasteful storyline. The inspirational material behind this film has been told for many years yet it took a while for any producer to utilise this well known concept. It could have had a bit less of a ""moral-ending"" I feel because this type of film never really holds life advice well. Other than that, the film ""Paul"" is a great watch with friends and has charming yet obscene humour.8/10",Paul
319,n-kalimin,A pleasant surprise that had me laughing all the way,9,2 March 2011,"I lucked out and received tickets to watch an advance screening of this movie. I had 0 expectations, the trailer didn't really show much, and generally went in with an open mind.Bottom line: no forced laughs and I laughed a plenty. The writing was absolutely brilliant. The gags are funny, and jokes come in smart and crude and those who are science fiction fans will get a huge kick out of how many hidden nods there are everywhere. Simon Pegg and Nick Frost did a fantastic job penning this script (as well as their acting)and well executed by Greg Mottola (Superbad and Adventureland). Simply put, I had a blast and it was just that much satisfying as a film overall.Personally, I would have given it a 10, but it may be hard to recommend to a wide audience. I would expect anyone aged from 16 to 30 would enjoy it the most given the amount of vulgarity in the movie. Basically, I wouldn't recommend it to my parents because they definitely will get turned off by it.I was initially skeptical about Seth Rogan voicing Paul: DON'T WORRY. He does a great job and you end up loving the character. All the actors in this film were great and you will enjoy their roles.",Paul
320,lexintone,A movie worth watching,8,20 September 2011,"Do ever feel the need to watch a silly but hilarious flick?well this is the movie.Paul our friendly alien will captivate your imagination and redefine the term extraterrestrial for you.Director Greg Mottola has brought in an entire different aspect of aliens on earth.First Paul supposedly crashed landed on earth in some sixty years ago.Then randomly runs into our two main characters Simon Pegg, Nick Frost.Then a chase ensures the FBI hot on paul and his new friends trail they run into a a girl whom they accidentally kidnap.Honestly no need to spoil it just watch it.On the other hand the director(Greg Mottola) may not have directed major movies but for the few he has done notably Superbad (2007),adventureland,just to mention a few,all show he is humor oriented guy.Ironical in some sense that the ET in this case is viewed as funny and friendly unlike as perceived buy other directors.The script was original,the characters sold the act and created one beautiful flick.",Paul
321,bccombs08,Offensive,1,18 March 2011,"The movie was just okay. The trailers spoiled all of the funny parts, so watching the movie really is a waste of time if you've seen a commercial for it. Movie plot is fairly weak. Crude ""humor"" is the backbone of this film. If you're 13 years old and an atheist I'm sure you'd love it. Very disrespectful of the Christian faith. The movie goes out of its way to insult Christianity, and it serves no purpose to the plot. The first few insults stung a little, but I let it slide and attempted to enjoy the movie, but they would not stop claiming Christianity is false and that those who have faith are not intelligent. 2 characters are created as stereotypical Christians with phrases like, ""I'm on a mission from God!"" being used to make fun of those who believe in God. This was nowhere near as funny nor as entertaining as Shawn Of The Dead and Hot Fuzz. If you are a fan of Simon Pegg and Nick Frost films as I am, this is a low point for their careers.",Paul
322,Ania_Bothe,Really liked it,8,1 November 2016,"Really liked the movie - very quirky - Spielbergy - surprising - US/UK - curse nerd worthy and others dialogue - good cast and very appropriate alien appearances of - actors seemingly had a lot of fun - story, dialogues - Its very humanist even so its alien - I always wondered why people are writing so much in those reviews and now I know, you will have to. A short review will not get published. I somehow need to fill 10 lines even so I wanted to keep it really really short as I was always a bit annoyed by all these very long reviews and simply wanted to have a short cool or not cool plus. I need to keep writing to fill line number 10 - Enjoy :)",Paul
323,Danny-mc-69,Great laughs but some flaws,7,17 February 2011,"Now I loved Hot Fuzz, and I loved Shaun of the Dead. Nick and Simon make an absolutely hilarious couple that are so comfortable with acting with each other they could probably do softcore porn together. That is what makes their double act so unique and, well, funny! I went into this film with doubts as Seth Rogen isn't the funniest of characters. He's like Jason Statham. The same character in every movie. He's the stoner, slacker guy full of penis jokes. There's no change here though he is a CGI alien. Usually i'd totally discard this thinking that there's no comedy in penis jokes and getting high but although quite a few jokes didn't land, there were many that Seth Rogen's character Paul, did make me laugh. This was a huge step for Seth in my books as he had never made me physically laugh before. Smirk yes, but this took me by surprise.Although this film is by the director of Greg Mottola, as opposed to Nick and Simons usual director for their comedic masterpieces, it managed to pull off a hell of a journey full of laughs, very funny connections between Paul and our conception of aliens today and the hilariously coincidental stories the script has managed to conjure up to associate with Paul. This almost got an 8 stars if it wasn't for the penis jokes and sex jokes. (SPOILER) Plus the swearing from the Christian girl got old, QUICK.",Paul
324,Fundevila,"Filme muito ""simpático"" e divertido",9,18 December 2011,"At the beginning does not expect much from this movie, the way it is filmed may displease some people (I personally like). Here in Portugal this movie was unknown to me and some friends of mine. Someone told me it was a fun movie and I decided to see this movie at home by accident. I was not expecting that was special but after seeing it, I can say that is special to the point of coming here to write a very positive reviews. Paul is the alien, friendliest and most fun I've ever seen. It is a movie that sees quite well and even after finishing, we are still thinking about the scenes and smiling for a while. I'm going back to see him more times for sure. Strongly recommend watching this movie. :))))",Paul
325,profesionaldj2003,Another great comedy,10,30 March 2011,"I'm going to keep it short and simple. The movie is hilarious and very entertaining. However,if you are a 10 year old or hardcore Christian and take everything they say against religion in the movie personally, then don't see it. I hate it when people say a movie is awful cause they bashed something. I'm a Christian. But, remember people, it's just a movie. That's all. That said. Moving on... There is a lot of swearing in the film, and at times, perhaps to much. But, still,I thought it was great. Had me laughing the whole time and it was well worth the ridiculous Ticket prices at the box office. I look forward to getting it when it comes out on DVD.",Paul
326,marcoss-975-889712,"Well done Guys , well done",7,12 February 2011,"I was on the Irish premier of the movie last Thursday with Simon Pegg and Nick Frost showing up and saying few words before the movie . First of all, I would like to say great cast especially Sigourney Weaver , Jason Bateman and my two mini stars of the movie Bill Hader and Joe Lo Truglio as agents Haggard and O'Reilly . The movie its self is very funny and the script well written , the small alien with voice from Seth Rogen its very real and well made by CG artists . Obviously the chemistry between Frost and Pegg is great like always ( you know what I'm saying if you remember Shaun of the dead or Hot Fuzz )Rogen as alien is a perfect cast with his IM SMOKING WEED voice and great lines . In summary well made , great cast , funny script what else do you need for Friday night . For me seven stars",Paul
327,amydmceciliap,i loved this film,10,17 February 2011,"I personally thought the film was great. to be honest, i was dreading the thought of nick frost and simon pegg giving into typical Hollywood funded film genre, but Im glad to say they kept the British humour and the usual character types we love so much. I thought Seth Rogen was a great voice for Paul, who I found hilarious and thought the cgi was great. I was glad they had a romance, which wasn't with a stereotypical, unbelievable beautiful who would never like them, but was in fact another funny factor to the film. I was also happy to see an emotional plot near the end of the movie, which related to paul seeing someone from his past, which was a nice twist :) Some of the American acting was a little lost on me, but at the end of the day 9.5/10, :)",Paul
328,wainbowdwops,"Paul is brilliant, a shining example of superb British comedy.",9,18 February 2011,"Proper belly busting laughter with gags delivered using perfect timing. Simon Pegg & Nick Frosts' performances successfully summed up the UK geek culture perfectly. Kristen Wiigs' performance as the religiously confused Ruth when learning how to curse reminded me of legendary performances by Les Dawson when playing the piano incorrectly. Jason Batemen playing special agent ""Lorenzo Zoil"" must be the corniest joke since ""Gay Fokker"" (Meet the parents), but the context and delivery was priceless. My local cinema almost full for the first time since Titanic and generated a round of applause at the end which I have not seen in the cinema for a long time. Makes me proud to be British. Lets hope for a lot more from Pegg & Frost being the funniest comedy duo since Morecambe & Wise. A truly enjoyable movie which can be summed up as a 21st century E.T. from an adults point of view.",Paul
329,richard-bown-983-755054,Weak,6,21 February 2011,"First of all, I love big train, spaced, shaun of the dead and hot fuzz, and maybe i had too high expectations of Paul, but it is the weakest thing Simon Pegg and Nick Frost have done to date.I'm a sci-fi and comics nerd, and to be fair the last half an hour of the film was the best with plenty of referential lines to other sci-fi movies.Maybe the lack of edgar wright showed too much, but the story was very very weak, which would be OK if there were plenty of gags to keep the audience amused, but shot after shot of a camper van going by gets dull really quickly.The other disappointing thing was how weak the friendship between the two main characters was. Nick & Simon have done this perfectly in Spaced, Shaun and Hot Fuzz and here it was just a watered down version of work done better elsewhere.No clever shots, close-ups and cuts to other scenes, it does seem to be geared towards a more main stream audience, which in itself is odd considering the subject matter and in-jokes. disappointment Overall I have to say this was a disappointment. They should re-team up with edgar wright for their next movie outing.",Paul
330,leif-faed,Funniest movie of the year!,10,27 May 2011,"Firstly, I am not a critic - I watch movies to be entertained. It must be horrible to sit and watch something and analyse everything. To be honest, tearing something apart is much easier than just simply praising it for what it is and was meant to be. This movie made me laugh many times, and that is exactly what I go to see. (Especially when you consider the price you pay!) I must admit though, I did go into the movie without watching the trailers or reading any reviews, all I knew about this movie was that the two funniest guys I know of in recent years are back in another movie. I think that (at times!) it can be the best way to see a movie you know is going to be good. Everyone else has covered all the details of the film 'ad nauseam' in their reviews, I am not going to regurgitate all the awesomeness of this movie. If you like Pegg and Frost in their other movies (Shaun of the Dead and Hot Fuzz) you should love this one to, all the roles were filled perfectly. I loved it and I think Pegg and Frost are the best comedic duo in decades. 'Run fat boy, run' just wasn't the same without Frost. I hope they make many more movies together. Everything they touch turns to gold.",Paul
331,baj001,A lot better than what most people are saying this is.,10,9 March 2011,"I honestly don't see how people can hate this movie! I thank the uploaders from the UK allowing us across the pond to have a free look at this movie before it's released out here. I absolutely loved this movie from start to finish. It starts out with just 2 nerds, being nerds through and through, wondering if there is alien life out there, never really expecting to see an alien, then bam, alien right in their midst. The story is witty, comical, and does surprise you a lot. I see people complaining about Paul knowing English, how all these alien movies have the aliens knowing English right off the bat, but what they failed to recognize was that Paul had been in custody for like 50 years and has a supreme intellect compared to humans, if he couldn't learn English in that span, then I don't know what to tell you, but his alien friends at the end did speak a language that wasn't English, so that pretty much clears up why he would know English. But I loved all the tributes to other sci-fi movies, and how they attributed Pauls look to what we've come to know aliens as looking like, and how they explained that thats why we see that image today so we wouldn't be freaked out if Paul ever did get out in the public. Overall, the story was great, there's some good twists and turns, and I think it ends on a good note, and just an overly enjoyable movie whether you're into scifi or not!",Paul
332,brianthomas123,well rounded original comedy,8,19 March 2011,"this movie was great for one reason, creationism vs darwinism. very few if any alien movie has dealt with and included Jesus ""freaks"" in the cast and plot, and this movie does it beautifully at the end when the dad still isn't convinced there's no god and he says like god bless you or w/e to paul. and pauls just like, yea whatever dude. that was great.i love simon pegg but i was quite disappointed with hot fuzz and run fatboy run was decent, but they hit it outta the park in this one. you get to see them on ""holiday"" here as they travel through the-otherwise boring, unless you like aliens- southwest visiting all the alien landmarks.then along comes paul, admittedly-and not surprisingly- essentially seth rogan in all his other movies. but i gotta admit its much more satisfying watching an alien chief a joint than i had expected, kudos to this one. money well spent",Paul
333,saiyanwarrior14437282,"Great movie, worth the watch.",9,20 March 2011,"I went to see Paul today (Sunday march 20th) I have to say it was very funny, The Graphics of some of the things in that movie were really good, The creator of Paul the alien did very well. The eye detail/features were amazing and the way the skin and body shape looked was pretty much dead on. As i watched the movie i didn't honestly expect there to be a alien with awesome powers and to swear, drink and smoke at all. The end of the movie was pretty sad, a lot of people in the theater cried when Graeme was shot. I can say i did expect the healing part to come in from the part with the bird but i did not expect Paul to recover. I was expecting an extremely sad movie but all in all it was funny and i enjoyed watching it.",Paul
334,andystill,Very disappointing,2,24 March 2011,"I laughed for the first 15 minutes or so of the movie as all of the previewed ""funny scenes"" were shown. I expected the rest of the movie to be as funny, and was very disappointed. Paul was all down-hill from there. If the negative characterization of ""Christians"" was about Muslims, gays, or Jews, the film would have been slammed as ""hate propaganda"". It was really that bad. Don't waste your time or money on a movie that really does preach hate for a people-group and has no other redeeming value. The hate propaganda is so simplistic and uneducated that it is exposed as mean and derogatory. Tired, old, repetitive, and barely creative sophomoric humor failed to entertain for the last two-thirds of the movie, and I was simply left feeling cheated and abused. Several attempts at humor could have been laughable if it weren't so poorly performed by the ""actress"" portraying the Christian girl ""freed"" by the alien and geek abduction. In my opinion, not even worth a rental.",Paul
335,dannyeller-9-186214,Homosexuality OK... Christianity idiotic???,2,24 March 2011,"Homosexuality OK... Christianity idiotic??? I just saw ""Paul"". The whole point of the movie is to portray Christians as moronic buffoons. It uses humor in making excuses for Homosexual conduct as being ""OK"" and Christianity as idiotic.Pegg ""Once I had to kiss three guys; real full-on snogs. I think every man should snog another man. A kiss is so much more than physical touching"".So if Homosexuality is OK then that must mean that Christianity must be wrong.... get it? He uses a cute smarta$$ green alien to make his point by using ""His existence proves there is no God"". Really??? I haven't seen any but I would not be surprised if there were other intelligent life out there. Just more proof that God is quite busy and has been around a really long time.Pegg's attack on our faith is neither funny nor warranted. I hope the little Marxist stays in England and makes another funny film but this time poke Islam in the eye. But then again the little atheist commy coward wouldn't do that now would he?",Paul

It was full of forced obscenities clearly and artificially trying to make the movie funny...for people who knee-jerk laugh when obscenities are used. (Yawn) I got numb to that after a while but what was really offensive it that apparently the real purpose for the movie was to debunk any belief in God and Christians were ""shown"" to be idiots. Any believer who watched this movie would have to be offended. If they just hadn't cheapened it with excessive and unnecessary gutter language and hadn't pushed their agenda of Godlessness, this could have been a funny movie.

On the surface it appears to be a cute movie for kids, but it is far from that. The only thing good about the movie is the job they did on ""Paul"". Very lifelike. It could have been a great movie, but missed the mark due to all the filth! The movie is only rated PG-13, and should be rated ""R"", for sure. My wife and I were very surprised and shocked at the horrible language and the seemingly approval of using drugs. There were some funny parts, but not as many as there could have been.

Lorenzo Odone had the disease Adrenoluekodistrophy, known as ALD, which wears away the myelin on nerves. Myelin is like the insulation on electrical wires. The brain and motor function are affected, and usually the person with ALD ends up not being able to walk and/or function normally. My stepson, who is 25, was diagnosed with ALD when he was 10. My wife's brother died from it at 33. So, to the ass-clowns that came up with the name Lorenzo Zoil, go get a clue as to what ALD is and how horrible it is.",Paul
339,lilbit_ljm,Blatantly intolerant and crude,1,10 April 2011,"This movie was very disappointing. A mediocre plot plummeted to terrible very quickly. According to this movie, anyone who believes in God is an idiot. It goes out of its way to portray Christians as intolerant, ignorant backwoods folk. It is one thing to support evolution and atheism. It is another thing entirely to demean and insult anyone who believes otherwise. Exalting yourself by tearing others down is juvenile and cruel.Any possible humor was tainted by this movie's blatant intolerance of Christianity or simply any God at all.Aside from the religion bashing, the movie was mediocre at best. The humor was uninspired. Most of the laughs were expected to come from the use of foul language. I have heard that this is not a ""true"" Simon Pegg and Nick Frost movie. For their sake, I hope that is true.",Paul
340,Finboats,Awful,1,30 May 2011,An interesting premise that turned into a dreadful movie.The previous review mentioned language. This is a PG-13 movie. The language is terrible and extreme. Not just salted in here and there for effect but rather a constant.The slam against religion is a major part of the movie. If the producers wanted to impress us with their snide disgust for religion why didn't they make the focus Islam? That would be impressive. Crapping on Christians is lazy and shows a real lack of talent.The only good thing about this cinematic experience was that I got to see it at Grauman's Chinese. I hadn't been there for quite a while.Avoid this movie - if you have children...really avoid this movie.,Paul

There are tons of movies out there when the main characters find a alien, or a prehistoric man who came from a different universe or time and the only source of humor when the creature tries to discover our world.This movie different. There is a extraterrestrial (Seth Rogen) who have already known everything and he is responsible for the 47's Rosewell accident. He likes drinking, smoking, cursing and he has a weird sense of humor. During his escaping journey meets two nerds (Simon Pegg and Nick Frost) and a half eyed Christian girl who later realize that saying curses is fun. This situation contains lot of funny moments and jokes.The other strong side"" of this movie the references. I don't think anybody can discover all of them at the first time. This could be a problem if you are not a nerd because you miss plenty of jokes. Of course the movie can't come through without clichés so the story is about escaping from the planet but they are doing this a really funny and unique way.This movie really deserves a chance!",Paul

I would recommend to all that like a bit of a laugh, and all those who enjoy Simon Pegg/Nick Frost films (Shaun of the dead/Hot Fuzz). Teenagers would love it just as much as adults do because of it's humour and fab plot line.

Paul is a bad movie, because it is cheesy, corny and totally foreseeable. From the moment Paul healed the bird and told everyone that it is actually dangerous for him, I knew he was going to heal someone at the end of the movie. There were some funny scenes, but the hole movie just tries too hard to be funny. It just doesn't work out. The end was horrible.

Regrettably this film (paul) is not as good as I had imagined it would be. The story is weak, Many parts seem bland in its delivery, some scenes are too wordy, Some lacking of liveliness and creativity. Even more those two English comedians genius couldn't afford to bring up a solid humorous atmosphere as well as they had done in shaun of the dead to save the day. Nay they look trying too hard to be funny. More over there are some disrupting performances of the supporting characters, baroque in their awfulness.

When this movie first came out, I don't think I finished it and I wasn't even saved yet. Mostly, I didn't find an alien cussing in every sentence to be that funny. I saw it on TV again now 2018, and I joined in the middle right at the part where the half blind woman explained her blasphemous Jesus shirt (Jesus shooting someone for blasphemy). Then went on to Paul being offensive. Left the TV channel, came back shortly and it was on the scene where he heals the half blind girls eye. At this point, she has her faith in him now? I guess he's taking the place of her savior now, right? Disgusting. We're all entitled to our own beliefs but to release movies that mock our Savior and turn people away from Christ is careless and unwise but they'll have to answer for that.
