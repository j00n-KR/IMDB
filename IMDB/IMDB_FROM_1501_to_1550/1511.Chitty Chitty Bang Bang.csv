0,TheLittleSongbird,"If you want some entertainment, look no further than this!",9,12 February 2009,"The only criticism is that at 2 and a quarter hours it is probably too long, I personally could have done without the spies, whose antics were rather silly rather than funny. Mind it is only two minutes longer than Mary Poppins, which I also love. Films like Mary Poppins, Wizard of Oz and this were my childhood favourites, and if you want some entertainment in a musical, look no further than this. It has a witty script, anything the Grandfather says is enough to crack anybody up and Gert Frobe as the Vulgarian king is hilarious. The songs are unforgettable, and beautifully staged, the car looks glorious and the performances are first-rate. Dick Van Dyke is brilliant here. Personally I think he was better than he was in Mary Poppins. Sally-Ann Howes is beautiful as Truly, and she has a beautiful voice(apparently she has perfect pitch) Unlike some people, I thought "" Lovely Lonely Man"" was lovely, and the imagery was as if you were in a fairytale. Lionel Jeffries is really entertaining as the Grandfather, I couldn't believe he was younger than Dick Van Dyke. The children can't sing, but they can act and are cute. Finally, Robert Helpmann's child catcher, competes with Tim Curry's Pennywise in It as the scariest character on film, and I genuinely mean that. This film is beautiful with fabulous costumes- Howes never looked lovely than in her stunning white dress in ""Lovely Lonely Man"" and sets(especially the castle and Truly's garden), a must see. 9.5/10 Bethany Cox",Chitty Chitty Bang Bang
1,bkoganbing,Rding With A Fine Four Fendered Friend,7,10 November 2007,"Chitty Chitty Bang Bang is probably the best Julie Andrews film that did not star Julie Andrews. Though with Dick Van Dyke in the male lead and the songs by the team of Sherman and Sherman, you've got to wonder whether the folks at United Artists did in fact consider Ms. Andrews originally.If they did, she turned it down because she wasn't the lead. The focus here is on Van Dyke an eccentric inventor in Edwardian Great Britain raising two small children with their grandfather, Lionel Jeffries who's a bit of an eccentric himself.I have to confess I do wonder what happened to mother. It's a family film so we assume Van Dyke's a widower. It's also never spelled out whether Jeffries is the paternal or maternal grandfather.Anyway when lovely Sally Ann Howes nearly runs over the children in her spanking new automobile, she feels bad and offers them a lift home and that's how the lady known as Truly Scrumptious comes into their lives.The kids have a mission, an old car that they play inside is about to be sold to the junkman for scrap and they want dad to buy it save it for them. The first part of the film is Van Dyke's quest for the money to buy the car. The second is their adventure in that magical car which Van Dyke transforms into an aerodynamical flivver. Of course some very nasty villains headed by Gert Frobe want the car.Gert Frobe is apparently the meeting point where Mary Poppins meets James Bond. Chitty Chitty Bang Bang originally was children's book written by James Bond author Ian Fleming for his son. Of course Frobe's best known role is in the title role in Goldfinger. It's also where Chitty Chitty Bang Bang goes into satire. Fleming was in British Intelligence during World War II and after the war some of Hitler's schemes which were already in practice about children being taken from parents and raised by the state became known. Frobe's kingdom is where the monarch decreed that children are forbidden and towards that end the sinister Child Catcher, played with aplomb by Robert Helpmann is used. Of course Van Dyke's foreign children are a prime target when they all arrive chasing a dirigible in which kidnappers have taken Lionel Jeffries thinking he's the inventor.Though Chitty Chitty Bang Bang gets silly at times it still remains a fine family film. And who could possibly resist a character named Truly Scrumptious which Sally Ann Howes is.",Chitty Chitty Bang Bang
2,Leofwine_draca,"Light, fluffy, fun",6,17 February 2014,"There's little to dislike about CHITTY CHITTY BANG BANG, a fun and colourful musical written by Ian Fleming, no less; it's packed with memorable music, has colourful cinematography, an imaginative script and a decent cast. Of the principal actors, it's fair to say that Dick Van Dyke puts memories of MARY POPPINS and dodgy accents behind him in his enthusiastic turn as madcap inventor Caractacus Potts.It's rare to find a film which boasts decent performances from the child actors, but they're good here, as are the likes of Benny Hill and Lionel Jeffries in support. The songs are a lot of fun, particularly the titular one, of course.My only complaint, which isn't too much of one, really, is that it grows more and more fantastic as it goes on, and the last third is more like a silly fantasy sequence; there's Roald Dahl to blame for that, I think. At least the writers saw this and put in an explanation of it being all a dream sequence so that it kind of makes sense.",Chitty Chitty Bang Bang
3,SnoopyStyle,Fun children's movie but not all of it works,6,27 November 2014,"In the 1908 Grand Prix de France, one of the cars crash and ends up in a garage in rural England which is beloved by children Jeremy and Jemima Potts. Mr. Coggins is looking to sell it for scrap. They live with Grandpa Potts, their widowed wacky inventor father Caractacus Potts (Dick Van Dyke) and their dog Edison. They meet wealthy Truly Scrumptious (Sally Ann Howes) driving her own car. She tries to tell Caractacus about his kids' truancy but he's unconcerned. They don't get along. One of his invention produces sweets with holes in them. He discovers that they toot and tries to sell them to Truly's confectionery manufacturer father Lord Scrumptious. He gets thrown out when the whistle brings dogs to overrun the factory. He eventually earns some money at the carnival and buys the car. The kids name it Chitty Chitty Bang Bang for the noise from the engine and the Bangs coming from the exhaust. They go to the beach for a picnic and Truly joins them. Caractacus tells them a story about the ruler of Vulgaria Baron Bomburst who wants to steal Chitty Chitty Bang Bang.This is from a children book written by Ian Fleming. Roald Dahl who wrote 'Charlie & the Chocolate Factory' also helps to write the screenplay. This is an unabashed children's movie. There are some disturbing aspects of the movie like the Child Catcher which I like. It doesn't all work. I don't particularly like the broad comedy coming from the two spies. Sally Ann Howes may be a great stage actress but she doesn't have the great presence as someone like Julie Andrews. Her chemistry with Dick Van Dyke is limited. There are a couple of fun songs. This doesn't quite measure up to 'Mary Poppins' but it tries to be in the same class. Also some of the magic seems to disappear when the movie goes to the castle. It's like the castle is too real and overwhelms any effort to give it a sense of fantasy. But you gotta love the car.",Chitty Chitty Bang Bang
4,mark.waltz,The guilty pleasure of all guilty pleasures.,7,22 December 2014,"There's so much to attack but so much to love (begrugingly) in this movie version of Ian Fleming's novel. Yes, indeed, the author of the Bond series wrote a musical about a magical car that floats, flies and bang bang bangs. It's also a lifesaver for the eccentric inventor Cattaragus Potts (Dick Van Dyke), his two precocious children (Adrian Hall and Heather Ripley), and a beautiful socialite (Sally Anne Howes) who is at the crossroads of her life and determined to get past the pretensions of being the daughter of a wealthy sweets manufacturer, Lord Scrumptious (a wonderfully imperious James Robertson Justice) who has nothing but her money to claim as her own. The widowed Potts and the lovely Truly don't hit it off at first (like many couples paired together in a movie musical), but her instant love for his children draws them closer, as does an adventure where they head off to a weird land of child-hating rulers and underground canyons where everybody under the age of 18 lives in fear.The Sherman Brothers achieve another hit in their musical catalog with the musical score, an obvious follow-up to ""Mary Poppins"", yet not released by Walt Disney. Van Dyke is the obvious choice for Potts, and with Julie Andrews unable to take on the role of the heroine, British musical diva Sally Anne Howes had her one American film role as Truly. ""Lovely, Lonely Man"" shows her as a gorgeous soprano, and it is sad for American audiences that she didn't get the chance to be seen in more films. Only some lucky audiences on Broadway got the chance to see her, mainly as a replacement in ""My Fair Lady"" for Andrews on Broadway.Hall and Ripley are delightful as the children, looking more real than the kids from ""Mary Poppins"" and delightfully coy in their attitudes towards life. Lionel Jeffries gives a glorious performance as their flustered grandfather, an eccentric world traveler who pretends to go around the world in his little shack which really appears to be an out-house. There's gloriously campy performances from Gert Frobe and Anna Quayle as the Baron and Baroness Bomburst who perform ""Choochy Face"" with the attitudes of teenagers in a seemingly perfect lovefest, but its obvious that the Baron can't stand her, leading to some hilarious innuendos of him obviously trying to snuff her out. ""Choochy Face"" is followed up by the hysterical visual of the dried-up court of prunes who surround them socially, giving this a cartoon feel in its live action presentation.Then, there's Robert Helpmann as the sinister looking Child Catcher, one of the most horrifying villains ever on screen, and one who probably gave a lot of children nightmares. He actually looks like he could be a distant relative of the Wicked Witch of the West, an escapee from Oz who was obviously banished by the little people who lived in that land. Even ""Willy Wonka"" with its darkness didn't have a character like this. Musically and choreographically, ""Chitty"" is phenomenal with several lavish production numbers, some extremely touching moments, and a fantasy element that is almost as magical as ""The Wizard of Oz"". A Broadway version proved to be even more elephantine than the movie, overly cute and missing the adult touches that made the movie as appealing to grown-ups as it was to children.",Chitty Chitty Bang Bang
5,lee_eisenberg,The world is upside down.,5,3 December 2006,"I know: you're going to call me a curmudgeon for what I'm going to say about ""Chitty Chitty Bang Bang"". But really folks, it's one of the hokiest movies imaginable. Maybe it's just that I don't like musicals - and this one seems to be almost a repeat of the equally hokey ""Mary Poppins"" - or maybe it seems like they're dissing Bulgaria, but I am not about to get enthralled by a movie like this. At least this time, Dick Van Dyke doesn't make a lousy attempt at an English accent.What I did while watching ""CCBB"" was what I often do while watching these sorts of movies: I heckled it, as Mike, Servo and Crow do to the crummy movies sent to them by Dr. Forrester on ""Mystery Science Theater 3000"". For example: ""You're not a very good father."" Hey, lady, give the guy a break; he tripped over an ottoman before this movie.""Bang, bang, chitty, chitty..."" Ever noticed what it spells if you change the ""c"" to ""s""? ""This nose never fails."" Yeah, but when it belonged to Nixon, it didn't smell his resignation coming.Probably what surprises me most about this movie is that Ian Fleming wrote it. How could it be that the man who wrote about a hunky super-spy bedding the world's hottest babes also wrote about a flying car? And Gert ""Goldfinger"" Frobe even stars! Speaking of which, when they first said Vulgaria, I thought that they said Bulgaria. I would assume that it was a Cold War thing, with Bulgaria in the Eastern Bloc and all. And why does the bad guy have to be a German baron ruling a non-free country? The whole movie comes across as propaganda in that sense.Oh well, at least it gives one an opportunity to make ""MST3K""-style jokes. As for the very fact that Dick Van Dyke starred in this, I read that in the late '60s and early '70s, he had a drinking problem; maybe to that we can attribute his decision to star in this. OK, I admit that that's probably not the reason that he starred in this. But any movie featuring a character named Jemima...well, doesn't that name have a reputation like the name Adolf? So that's my take on this.Still, it was neat to see Neuschwanstein Castle. I once put together a 6,000-piece puzzle showing it.",Chitty Chitty Bang Bang
6,jboothmillard,Chitty Chitty Bang Bang,6,4 May 2006,"This wasn't very popular at the cinema, I would of thought it would be. The makers of Mary Poppins and James Bond teamed together to create this musical based on Ian Fleming's great story about a fantastic invention. Knowing how fun and funny he was in Mary Poppins (apart from the accent), I really wanted to see what Dick Van Dyke would be like. He plays Caractacus Potts, an inventor, who recently created the great Toot Sweets for Truly Scrumptious (Sally Ann Howes), daughter of a candy factory owner. Anyway, the best invention that he created was the fantastic ""Chitty Chitty Bang Bang"" car, or ""Chitty"" for short. It can go really fast, float on water, and of course fly. Also starring Lionel Jeffries as Grandpa Potts, Gert Fröbe (Goldfinger) as Baron Bomburst, Benny Hill as Toymaker, James Robertson Justice as Lord Scrumptious, Robert Helpmann as the scary Child Catcher, Heather Ripley as Jemima, Adrian Hall as Jeremy, Barbara Windsor as Blonde and Desmond Llewelyn (Bond's Q) as Mr. Coggins. It may have been slightly long, and cheesy moments, but it is still a fun film for all the family. It was nominated the Oscar and Golden Globe for Best Song, ""Chitty Chitty Bang Bang"" (could have won either), and it was nominated the Golden Globe for Best Original Score for Richard M. Sherman and Robert B. Sherman. It was number 37 on The 100 Greatest Scary Moments for The Child Catcher, it was number 14 on The 100 Greatest Family Films, and it was number 11 on The 100 Greatest Musicals. Good!",Chitty Chitty Bang Bang
7,ccthemovieman-1,Strictly For Little Kids,3,31 March 2007,"I really enjoyed the beginning of this film with a neat old-time auto race. Then the main characters in the movie were introduced and they were all likable and nice. The kids were cute and Dick Van Dyke's inventions were fun to view. (So is Van Dyke's name in here: ""Caractacus Potts."")About halfway into the film - maybe this was just me - but those high-pitched whiny-type voices on the kids (""Daddy this, Daddy that"" constantly) got to me. By then, I also had the general flavor of the songs, which I did not find particularly good.The special-effects with the flying car might have been passable in 1968 but they look really dated now. The humor, too, was too juvenile especially with the villains who weren't funny, just stupid.However, I am writing this criticisms as an older adult and I am sure little kids would still like this movie, as they did 40 years ago, except even they are bound to get fidgety sitting through 144 minutes of this!",Chitty Chitty Bang Bang
8,ma-cortes,Stunning and amusing tale about a flying car and the family owner with a sympathetic Dick Van Dyke,7,7 January 2012,"This exciting children musical displays derring-do adventure, romance , thrills and spectacular frames with phenomenal production design . Imagination and fantasy with primitive but effective special effects galore including a mesmerizing photography with wonderful , marvelous landscapes . The flick gets lots of bombastic effects including flying machines , globes , romantic castles and numerous images have you on the edge of your seat . This is the most Fantasmagorical musical entertainment in the history of everything . In the early 20th century England, a weird inventor named Caractacus Potts (Dick Van Dyke who steals the show as likable dancer and splendid player) works in his rare artifacts , he lives along with his equally rare father (Lionel Jeffries) , and his two little boys named Jeremy (Adrian) and Jemima (Heather). When the kiddies beg their daddy to buy for them thhe wished plaything , a broken car sitting at a local junkyard , a garage whose owner is George Coggings (Desmond Llewelyn) . Then eccentric Caractacus does whatever he can to make some money to buy it. One plan to raise money involves the unexpected help of a beautiful girl they have just met named Truly Scrumptious (a pretty young woman well performed by Sally Anne Howes), the daughter of a candy factory wealthy owner (James Robertson Justice) . Using his magic skills, inventive Caractacus turns the piece of junk into a marvelous working machine , an amazing flying car that also navigates which they name Chitty Chitty Bang Bang because of the noise the engine sounds . At a seaside picnic with his children and Truly , Caractacus and Co. spins a fanciful tale of an eccentric inventor, his gorgeous new friend , his two children, and his favorite car named Chitty all in the faraway country of Vulgaria. The nasty Baron Bomburst, the king of Vulgaria, will do whatever he can to get his hands on the magical car. Then the villain Baron Bomburst (Gert Frobe) married to Baroness Bomburst (Anna Quayle) robs the car of ours friends . The baron has made kiddies illegal, being pursued by the sinister child catcher (Robert Helpmann) including the unsuspecting children of a stranger inventor of a fabulous car . Later on ,Caractacus helped by a toymaker (Benny Hill) have to attempt and save the kiddies of Vulgaria.This children motion picture mingles musical numbers , flat jokes , noisy action , flying car pursuits , humor with tongue-in-cheek, rip roaring and lots of amusement . This is an entertaining film loosely based on book by Ian Fleming and well adapted by Roal Dahl , it packs fantasy , musical numbers which both pastiche and subvert adventure and speculative fiction of the period ¨Belle Epoque . The picture incorporates contemporary action film as well as much use of adventure to portray its fanciful elements , furthermore visual effects within the form of the older-style films they have largely superseded . Riveting for its casting , but overall , roller-coaster spectacle . Most of the charm and wit remains from original story in this particular version . It results to be an amusing of somewhat aloof , storytelling of children classic with a magnificent star cast at its best . Stimulating adventures of ours protagonists are complemented by a breathtaking final attraction in the castle scenes . The film is a Dick Van Dyke recital , he sings , dances, stooges, makes acrobatics, tongue twister and pulls faces and grimaces . It's a farce with the master comic pretty amusing and with several choreography and musical numbers . Ideal main cast is completed by phenomenal secondary actors as Lionel Jeffries , James Robertson Justice , Benny Hill and Desmond Llewelin , among others. Atmospheric , lively score by Irwin Kostal , fitting splendidly to adventure and musical numbers , including the classic leitmotif . Colorful and glamorous cinematography by Christopher Challis in Super Panavision 7o with the fantastic château scenes filmed in Neuschwanstein Castle, Hohenschwangau, Schwangau, Bavaria, Germany . The picture is lavishly produced by Albert R Broccoli ,James Bond's producer, and brilliantly directed by Ken Hughes . He's a good writer, producer and director, who achieved big time when made ¨Cromwell¨, ¨Trials of Oscar Wilde¨ , ¨Casino Royale¨ and of course with ¨Chitty , Chitty Bang Bang¨.This is a highly amusing and frequently funny action-adventure romp with a witty script specifically aimed at a kiddies' audience , though excessive songs leave adult spectators a bit seasick . Picture is a vehicle Van Dyke , he's an authentic comic and real Farceur. If you like Dyke's crazy interpretation , you will most definitely enjoy this one . Well worth watching for passable special effects and an enjoyable performances from main cast as the children will like it.",Chitty Chitty Bang Bang
9,moonspinner55,Doggedly whimsical...,4,30 January 2009,"Elephantine, ersatz-Disney family film with musical interludes has kooky inventor Dick Van Dyke, his two moppet kids and new lady-love outwitting the rulers of an evil fantasy world with help from their airborne automobile. Director Ken Hughes, who also co-adapted Ian Fleming's novel with none other than Roald Dahl, can't manage to work up any life within this not-too-fantastic scenario; it's an adventure story involving a flying car which never lifts off. The sugary songs aside, this loosely-hinged and slowly-paced picture doesn't even look good. The special effects are bland and chintzy (even for 1968). As to the performances, Van Dyke has always been an acquired taste, but Sally Ann Howes is certainly no Julie Andrews (though Ken Hughes fashions her role accordingly). Songwriters Richard M. Sherman and Robert B. Sherman work with the very best of intentions here (and the title song is catchy, as is ""Truly Scrumptious""), but the Shermans are still doing what they did back in the early-'60s: winking and nudging at us with nursery ditties, almost all of which suffer from a fatal case of the cutes. *1/2 from ****",Chitty Chitty Bang Bang
10,JohnHowardReid,"Has its faults, alas!",7,14 November 2016,"Copyright 17 December 1968 by Warfield Productions—Dramatic Features. Released through United Artists Pictures.

Sydney opening at the Paris. 145 minutes.SYNOPSIS: An unsuccessful inventor weaves a story about an old car that he has made over into a shiny new contraption.NOTES: The title song was nominated for an Academy Award, losing to ""The Windmills of Your Mind"" from ""The Thomas Crown Affair"".""Chitty Chitty Bang Bang"" took more money in Great Britain in 1969 than any other movie except ""Oliver"" and a re-issue of ""Gone With The Wind"". In the U.S.A., ""Chitty"" achieved 12th position for 1969.COMMENT: We keep waiting for the big musical production number involving all the Vulgarians which will climax the whole thing, but curiously there isn't one. Maybe just as well since Gert Frobe gives such a flat-footed performance, mistiming even such mildly amusing lines as ""Never mind, I get her next time"". Even in his comedy duet, he seems to be a beat behind his partner. The two spies similarly mangle their opportunities. They are dud hams. A pity two more interesting people weren't cast. Benny Hill has a small role complete with accent which he plays virtually straight, but Helpmann makes the most of his couple of scenes as the child catcher. Dick Van Dyke is his usual pseudo-engaging self — an energetic dancer, a fair vocalizer but a somewhat blandly nauseating personality. We keep waiting for Justice to come back. Sally Ann Howes is a pleasant singer but a cloying person and the kids are two spoiled, self- centered brats. Lionel Jeffries tends to overdo his part, especially in the early stages, but comes into his own with ""P=O=S=H"" and thereafter. The film is very uneven. It takes forever to get off the ground, but improves once we get to the JRJ scenes and Adam's splendid sets and the two great musical production numbers in the sweet factory and the delightful Bamboo dance at the fair. It's a pity the rest of the film is something of an anticlimax. In fact it's a different story altogether as the script itself acknowledges!",Chitty Chitty Bang Bang
11,wes-connors,Saw This Movie in Half,4,11 February 2015,"During the 1909 British Grand Prix, a formerly winning automobile crashes and is sent to the junkyard. The car is purchased by clumsy inventor Dick Van Dyke (as Caractacus Potts). A widower with a windmill and two chirpy, chirpy pre-teen children, Mr. Van Dyke meets pretty Sally Ann Howes (as Truly Scrumptious) when she gives the kids a lift home. She's not only pretty, but also rich and motherly. Van Dyke lives with his motherless children, a shaggy dog and lovably eccentric Lionel Jeffries (as Grandpa). If you're thinking, ""This group must somehow form a family,"" you'd be correct. The main attraction is the automobile, which Van Dyke restores. Named ""Chitty-Chitty-Bang-Bang"" due to the sound it makes, the car turns magical...The audience for this awkward, long musical will begin to drop off for viewers over the age of ten. Incredibly, this is from producer Albert R. Broccoli and the team responsible for turning Ian Fleming's spy novels into the visually dazzling ""James Bond"" film series. Checking on the original novel's plot shows significant differences. Most obviously, Ms. Howes seems to be a stand-in for Julie Andrews; still one of the world's biggest box office stars, Ms. Andrews would not have accepted this clearly less substantial role. Some of the character roles work, especially Robert Helpmann as the ""child catcher,"" and the title song is serviceable. The car is magical, but has no real personality of its own. If the car had more magic powers, it would cut this movie in half.**** Chitty Chitty Bang Bang (12/16/68) Ken Hughes ~ Dick Van Dyke, Sally Ann Howes, Lionel Jeffries, Robert Helpmann",Chitty Chitty Bang Bang
12,hitchcockthelegend,Fantasmagorical !,8,20 April 2008,"Based on the novel written by James Bond creator Ian Flemming, this delightful fantasy charts the journey into the mysteriously childless world of Vulgaria by Caractacus Potts, his two children, Truly Scrumptious and super car Chitty Chitty Bang Bang.I think the main thing that makes this film work so well is that it has a little of everything to make a successful family movie. Catchy tunes at every turn, a fairy tale kingdom awash with colour, bonkers technology, and a little slice of wickedness involving class distinction. Split very much into two halves, Chitty at its core is really about forming a complete family. We are introduced to Caracatus {Dick Van Dyke} who is a single father, who is doing his best to raise his two children with moral fortitude. It's thru the children's love of an old rusty car that Chitty Chitty Bang Bang is born, and after pretty lady Truly Scrumptious {a gorgeous Sally Ann Howes} comes into their lives, all four of them enter the second half of the movie after having firmly capturing the audience's attention with a firming promise of a family in waiting.The second half of the picture then whisks us far away into fantasy territory. Vulagaria is ruled by crackers toy obsessive Baron Bomburst {Gert Fröbe in wonderful bacon sandwich mode}, he has banned children, and naturally he has his sights set firmly on the magnificence that is Chitty Chitty. Bomburst sends out his child snatcher to nab Caracatus's kids in the hope of bargaining for the special car. The child snatcher played by Robert Helpman is as iconic as he is terrifying, wonky hat and pointy nose he lures children in with promises of sweets and treacle tarts, he thus became the invader of many a child's poor nightmares for sure.But this is a family film after all, and sure enough this splendid ride speeds to a joyous finale that is cloaked in colour and feel good eccentricity, yep, Chitty Chitty Bang Bang still works on repeat viewings. 8/10",Chitty Chitty Bang Bang
13,Theo Robertson,Not As Good As I Remembered,6,6 May 2004,"This is a fondly remembered musical from the 1960s . The producers are the same people who brought us the Bond films from the 1960s ( Many of the production team also worked on the Bond movies - And lets not forget who wrote the source novel ) and with the critical acclaim and fincial acclaim of MARY POPPINS still being felt what could be better than casting Dick Van Dyke as an Englishman ? So we`ve got a connection with James Bond and a connection with MARY POPPINS so what can go wrong ?Unfortunately no one took the passage of time into account but why should they ? After all no producer is able to do anything about that , but this is where the film falls down when watching it in 2004 - It`s not nearly as good as I remembered . Yeah the theme tune is good as is the "" Me Old Bamboo "" song and dance sequence but few of the other songs made any impression with me , and come to think of it most of them seem superflous especially when the story proper moves to the foreign country where children are banned . Amazingly the story doesn`t change location until well past halfway through the running time . Like a James Bond movie from the Roger Moore era CHITTY CHITTY BANG BANG seems obssesed by incident rather than narrative drive and is too long by at least half an hour .It might have been good at the time and I`m convinced it was but seems far less good now in 2004 . I should also confess that I watched THEATRE OF BLOOD another much loved film from my childhood later the same night and was even more disappointed after watching it . I guess I must be getting old and cynical",Chitty Chitty Bang Bang
14,grantss,Difficult to dislike,6,28 September 2015,"Charming, but incredibly unfocused. Starts very sweetly and promisingly. However, from a point it takes one bizarre random turn after another. Still very sweet and innocent, but devoid of a plot (surprising, considering the screenplay was written by Roald Dahl, based on an Ian Fleming book). The random scenes needn't have been so irritating if director Ken Hughes had just kept them to a minimum, as the remainder of the movie is great. However, the fairy tale sequence goes on for an eternity.Good performances by Dick Van Dyke and Sally Ann Howes in the lead roles. The kids, Heather Ripley and Adrian Hall, are great too. Good support from James Robertson Justice. Interesting to see Benny Hill in the fairy tale sequence - one of the few highlights of that part.Music is so-so. Some songs were downright cringeworthy.Overall, the charm and innocence more than make up for the random plot, and it would be very difficult to dislike the movie.

Dick Van Dyke plays the lovable loser of an inventor. He has two adorable kids that he's raising on his own. Then there's the wealthy love interest.

16,Wuchakk,Fun adventure in a flying jalopy with Dick Van Dyke & Sally Ann Howes,7,25 November 2017,"RELEASED IN 1968 and directed by Ken Hughes, ""Chitty Chitty Bang Bang"" chronicles events when an unsuccessful inventor (Dick Van Dyke) turns a dilapidated Grand Prix car into a fancy vehicle for his kids in England during the 1910s. With an upper-class woman (Sally Ann Howes), they go on a picnic which morphs into an amazing adventure to save their eccentric grandfather (Lionel Jeffries) in a kingdom on mainland Europe. Gert Fröbe & Anna Quayle play the ee-vil baron and baroness while Robert Helpmann and Benny Hill play the Child Catcher and Toymaker.This is a family-friendly adventure/fantasy/musical in the mold of ""The Wizard of Oz"" (1939), ""Mary Poppins"" (1964), ""Willy Wonka & the Chocolate Factory"" (1971), ""A Series of Unfortunate Events"" (2004) and ""Into the Woods"" (2014). I remember loving ""Chitty"" when I was a kid and was wondering how it would hold up as an adult and it's entertaining when you're in the mood for something fun, innocent and non-dismal/horrific. However, like those other flicks, there are dashes of dark, adult-oriented stuff, like the grotesque Child Catcher, the hottie (but inwardly hideous) baroness prancing around in her undergarments and the kids throwing soldiers off a cliff.There are also some spectacular European locations, like the breathtaking Neuschwanstein Castle in Bavaria, Germany. The only problem is that the movie's overlong by 30-45 minutes; they shoulda cut some of the unnecessary songs. But the title tune is a classic.THE FILM RUNS 144 minutes and was shot in England, France and Germany.

17,Sylviastel,"Come here, Chitty Chitty Bang Bang!",8,27 January 2007,"Okay, this film is not perfect. There are obvious faults and flaws but despite that there is a lot of fun in watching it and seeing the wonderful Dick Van Dyke who was a big star in England as well as in America and is still very much an icon in Hollywood standards today. The film is based on Ian Fleming's story. The same man who created James Bond also had fun in writing this story about a widowed father played by Van Dyke who does a marvelous job on his own as the star of this film. He reminds you of Bert from Mary Poppins only he has center stage. It's also great to see the lovely Barbara Windsor too who said that she would have paid them to work with Dick. There is of course, the wonderful Lionel Jeffries in a supporting role, Benny Hill as the toymaker, and Sir Robert Helpmann in a supporting role. The film has it's moments with the flying car, the special effects, the costumes, and art direction. It's fun family oriented film that can be appreciated by most people especially Dick Van Dyke fans. You think when they pay tribute to him at the Kennedy Center Honors that they will dance to Chitty Chitty Bang Bang! I can only hope that they don't forget his wonderful contributions to film, television, and theater.",Chitty Chitty Bang Bang
18,SimonJack,A funny fairytale for kids of all ages,7,15 January 2015,"As an older ""kid,"" I can still enjoy the fun of ""Chitty Chitty Bang Bang."" This is one of those early movies made for children with a little bit of adult humor. By that, I don't mean R-rated or toilet humor. I mean stuff written above the heads of most kids' understanding. There weren't as many such films back then, but there were some. It's a precursor to the modern-day group of films – mostly animated, that seem to be written as much for adults as for the young crowd. I enjoy some of these films myself (""Ice Age,"" ""Madagascar,"" ""Shrek""). The modern film adult humor is usually in dialog that accompanies visuals. In ""Chitty Chitty"" and other early movies for kids, the adult reach most often is in the dialog that can stand by itself. The kids are watching a funny scene while we older viewers are chuckling at what we just heard while watching the same scene. It's still humorous to me that this movie was based on a book by Ian Fleming. But, when I think about some of the gimmicks that the M15 spy group comes up with for James Bond, I can see a connection. Dick Van Dyke's character in this film, Caractacus Potts, is an inventor and tinker who has some strange and funny inventions. This movie resembles a fairytale in two ways – the fantasy portion itself, and that part as a story within a story. The cast are all very good. This is mostly Van Dyke's show, though, with his inventions and dance scenes. The candy factory song and dance routine is an excellent job of choreography. I watched a bonus video with my DVD in which Van Dyke says he pulled a muscle doing the whirling kitchen cart number. Sally Ann Howes adds a nice voice to song and is a good romantic match for Van Dyke. Gert Frobe is especially good as Baron Bomburst. The movie did receive an Oscar nomination for the title song. But unlike other films they composed and wrote lyrics for, the Sherman Brothers (Richard and Robert) didn't score any hits or memorable songs in this movie. Still, it's a fun movie to watch with youngsters, who will enjoy it most.",Chitty Chitty Bang Bang
19,sddavis63,Really - How Can You Not Like This?,8,26 February 2002,"A delightful fantasy for the whole family to watch. There really is something for everyone here. A cartoonish story with ""comic book characters"" like the ""Child Catcher"" (Robert Helpmann) and ""Baron Bomburst"" (Gert Frobe) that the kids will love, and some marvelous song and dance routines from Sally Ann Howe as ""Truly Scrumptious"" and Dick Van Dyke as the inventor ""Caractacus Potts"" that the grown ups will marvel at. I never realized until I watched this movie as an adult what a marvelously talented man Van Dyke is, but his dance scenes are absolutely amazing (particularly ""The Old Bamboo"" performance at the carnival.)The story is imaginative. A flying car whisks Truly and Caractacus, along with the two Potts children Jeremy and Jemima (Adrian Hall and Heather Ripley respectively) off to the fictional kingdom of ""Vulgaria"" (where children are forbidden) to rescue eccentric Grandpa Potts (played absolutely perfectly by Lionel Jeffries), who has been kidnapped by Bomburst in the mistaken belief that he's the inventor of the car. This was one of my favorite movies as a kid, and you have to think like a child to watch it and appreciate it as an adult. Until today I had never actually seen the movie unedited, and I found it just a delight.It's true that there are weaknesses. Although Dick Van Dyke put on a marvellous performance, he ironically seems totally out of place with his American accent. I truly can't figure out how Caractacus' father can have a British accent, and Caractacus' children can have British accents, but Caractacus himself has an American accent? It's something you wouldn't notice as a kid, but as an adult I found it somewhat distracting. Also, Hall and Ripley didn't blow me away (I know - give them a break; they were just kids. Still, I've seen better performances from children that age.)But why nitpick. Suspend disbelief, think like a kid, sit back and enjoy the ride.8/10.",Chitty Chitty Bang Bang
20,Pjtaylor-96-138044,Watch out for the 'Child Catcher'.,5,6 February 2021,"For its first hour, 'Chitty Chitty Bang Bang (1986)' is a generic but enjoyable, Disney-esque musical. Its song and dance sequences are diverting and well-choreographed, its cast are quietly charming and its typically rustic aesthetic serves its story well. However, the flick eventually decides to spend far too long on a sequence which depicts a story Van Dyke is telling to the kids. While certain elements of this much more fantastical segment are entertaining in their own way (such as seeing Goldfinger himself act in a wonderfully over-the-top and cartoonish way), it slows the film's pacing down to a crawl and feels really unnecessary. Without it, this nearly two-and-a-half hour film could've clocked in at around ninety minutes and been equally as narratively satisfying. Worse still, the songs in this fantasy segment aren't even as good as those from the affair's first movement. If the fantasy were presented as 'real', it would have been much more effective. It would still be somewhat out of the blue but it would have at least had proper stakes. As is, it's difficult to care about. Ultimately, though, the movie's issues don't dampen the effectiveness of its enjoyable first hour. It's a memorable, if uneven, musical that will probably please fans of the genre. 5/10",Chitty Chitty Bang Bang
21,gbill-74877,"Has its moments, both good and bad",4,3 September 2021,"It's probably unfair to comment on this film as an adult in 2021, as opposed to being a child in 1968, but I saw it long ago, and tried to calibrate myself in reviewing it. The film has its moments, such as Dick Van Dyke and Sally Ann Howes dancing as dolls to ""Doll on a Music Box,"" and buried beneath its bloated plot is a message that being eccentric, creative, and having one's heart in the right place are all wonderful things. It's one of those lavish productions that tries to be a musical, comedy, romance, fantasy, and drama, wanting to make sure viewers got a grand experience I suppose, and maybe there's something to be said for that.Unfortunately, the excess of the film comes along with pacing issues in the first half, and a tone that veers into some seriously off notes in the second, and that's where it broke down for me. The story the father tells his kids about the spies from Vulgaria that then forms the basis for most of the back half is awful on several levels. For one, it's clear that ""Vulgaria"" is just a euphemism for Germany, since its filmed there, its characters act stereotypically, and drop several German words. Their baron has passed an illogical decree outlawing children (how can that be sustainable? Okok it's just a story) and they hunt them in their hiding spots in houses ala the Nazis rounding up Jews, except here the Child Catcher character appears stereotypically Jewish, with a long nose and long black attire, apparently one of Roald Dahl's contributions. The Baron wants to kill the Baroness, and has a musical number with her in which she's wearing her lingerie, including a corset with garter belt. Aside from the questions I had about what the hell all this was doing in the film, it just wasn't entertaining to me. It needed clarity in its tone, and to be about an hour shorter.",Chitty Chitty Bang Bang

He likes to break into a song every once in a while, as does everyone else around him. It seems there are about three thousand songs in this never-ending musical and just about every one of them is god awful. It may have been enjoyable for pre-teen kids if not for the boring musical numbers. Van Dyke tries hard to be funny and lovable but the script is devoid of any humor. Howes does an impersonation of Julie Andrews. Benny Hill makes an appearance but is given little to do. The direction is incompetent and the special effects are cheesy.

24,clanciai,Dick van Dyke as an inventor flying high in his dreams and taking everyone with him,10,6 February 2020,"This is all the way a glorious and sumptuous feast for the eyes, with lots of entertainments, dancing and music on the way, it reminds both of ""Mary Poppins"" (but Julie Andres is msissing here), and ""Those Magnificent Men in their Flying Machines"", as Gert Froebe is back as yet another bombastic and ridiculous German original. The music is not as good as in ""Mary Poppins"", but the film manages all right anyway, especially because of the wonderful imagination, bringing even George Meliès and his visions back in splendid update. This is a film to whole-heartedly enjoy the whole way, and even the cinematography is impressing, above all in the sequences filmed about the Neuschwanstein castle in Bavaria. Here is also the only really terrible character of the film, Robert Helpmann as the Child Hunter, a nightmare character like taken directly from one of the Grimm brothers' most horrible tales. James Robertson Justice and Lionel Jeffries as the two old war veterans also add to the charm, the whole story is set in 1909, and everything is quite realistic from that epoch, returning once more the idyllic times before there were any world wars ruining the best of worlds.

25,tomgillespie2002,Increasingly sickly,5,16 November 2014,"To audiences young and old who grew up watching it, Chitty Chitty Bang Bang surely holds a warm, nostalgic place in their hearts. At the age of 29, this was my first viewing. I somehow knew all of the songs, knew everything that happens in the plot, and was certainly familiar with the notoriously creepy Child Catcher (Robert Helpmann). For me, watching the film was like eating a huge slice of cake. The first few bites are delicious and barely touch the sides, mid-way through you start to waver but you just can't seem to stop, but by the end your stomach is turning and you wish you'd never eaten the damn thing.The brain-child of James Bond creator Ian Fleming, the movie was only loosely adapted from his novel by children's author Roald Dahl and director Ken Hughes. Chocked full of sweets and machinery, most of the film will have children eating out of it's sugar-coated palm. When skipping school one day, two mop-headed children come across Truly Scrumptious (Sally Ann Howes), a pretty but strict lady who takes the children straight to their father to report their truancy. The father, eccentric inventor Caractacus Potts (Dick van Dyke), supports their free-spiritedness, much to the horror of Truly.While observing Potts' warehouse of barmy inventions, Truly comes across a sweet that can play like a flute. They takes it to Truly's father, Lord Scrumptious (James Robertson Justice), a successful confectionery manufacturer, who eventually throws Potts out when the place is overrun by dogs responding to the flute sweet. Eventually he saves up enough money to buy an old banger loved by his children and manages to fix it up, dubbing it 'Chitty Chitty Bang Bang' due to the clunking noise it makes. While off on a picnic one day, Potts and Truly start to fall for each other, and Potts tells his children the story of an evil pirate baron (Gert Frobe) who wants to steal the car for himself.Chitty Chitty Bang Bang is carried along by some gorgeous Technicolor cinematography by Christopher Challis and an energetic performance from van Dyke, who puts in a highly physical one-man show and remains effortlessly likable throughout. At two and a half hours, the film far outstays it's welcome. The majority of the songs are wonderful, but the film is slowed by mushy scenes, drab love songs and unnecessary sub-plots. It struggles with settling on a tone and ends up becomes a bloated mash-up. The first half of the movie I enjoyed as much as I did with the great's of the genre, until Grandpa Potts (the magnificent Lionel Jeffries) is whisked off to Vulgaria and it all becomes increasingly sickly.www.the-wrath-of-blog.blogspot.com",Chitty Chitty Bang Bang
26,Dr_Coulardeau,"Nothing better than aged whisky, even better Scotch",10,14 July 2013,"They don't make them like that anymore. A real double feature with intermission music and exit music, the first part ending in some catastrophe and the second part starting with the same catastrophe that turns upside down into a miracle. But it is a lot more than that.This musical is for children and it has all the characteristics that were considered normal in those days, I mean some forty years ago or so. Music of course, nice songs of course, but also the myth of the car, paid for the Ford Corporation or company, and the perfect family with a boy, a girl and a dog, with a grandfather and an unmarried father and of course a beautiful young lady near by.But the story goes far beyond and during a trip to the beach, the father starts telling a fantastic story that unveils itself as if it were true in the main story. It will be called a dream, it will be called some kind of a tale, fairy tale maybe, and that sounds a lot better than the ""mise en abyme"" of the Hollywood effete snobs. And it is a lot better for children who love stories within stories within stories, and in this case there are probably four or five, one inside the other, that come out like Jacks in the box and open up like Russian dollies, some Matryoshka full of surprise and the whole Bulgarian situation to which the children are captured, the grandfather is deported and the father and his young lady friend are baited and attracted is such a Russian dolly with the village and then the castle and in between several layers of prisons, dungeons and underground inescapable labyrinths.At each corner of these tunnels and corridors you have more dangers and dangerous soldiers or wardens than you may even count. It is a country where children are forbidden and when there is one or more, they are captured and deported to some concentration camp where they grow away from the sun and adults till they die. So from pirates we jump to a barbarous king who is a child who has never matured and only wants toys to play with and real soldiers to play war as if they were some tin soldiers. Then the main objective becomes the liberation of the children, of the village and the getting rid of this immature king who should have been institutionalized a long time ago. But in a way, in his own perverse way, he is funny and the tale will catch him up and send him back to real life under the identity of some Wall Street entrepreneur or speculator. We even forget the whole thing is a love story with the two children choosing their future mother and manipulating their father into marrying her. But do they know what they are doing? They seem to live on what was a norm in those days that a son and a daughter could not grow up if they did not have a father and a mother, without forgetting a dog and a house with a garden. And I forgot: they have to be poor at first and become rich in the end. It is definitely a precursor or pioneer of both Indian Jones and Back to the Future, though watching it in our modern world is like going back to the past when the dream was a real dream and the fun of the cinema was not competing with the humdrum never ending fun of TV and of course the even worse virtual bath in which we are soaking if not drowning all the time, the Internet and the Cloud. As for flying in the clouds, this car is sure good, as good at least as the car of the Crazy mad scientist of Back to the Future.Dr Jacques COULARDEAU",Chitty Chitty Bang Bang

29,lisafordeay,A timeless 60s musical starring Dick Van Dyke,9,15 November 2015,I haven't seen this movie in years as I seen it on TV as a little girl. Today I got it on DVD and watched it. The film is about an eccentric inventor(played by Van Dyke)who is a widower with two children. His two children spots an old banger that was set for sale by another man so his two children meet a woman named Truly(played by Sally Ann Howes) who offers them a ride home as they were suppose to go to school.Meanwhile their father ends up getting the car instead of the other man who wanted to buy it but didn't after so he builds it out of the new again and it turns from being a Grand Prix car into a magical flying car that flies and enters a whole new world by using their imaginations. For example Mr Potts imagines Pirates near a beach that they visit and other magical creations that they imagine.Overall packed with great songs including the title song Chitty Chitty Bang Bang from the same composers that gave us Mary Poppins and starring a great set of actors this is one feel good musical that we don't normally get anymore in cinema history. If I had any complaints about this film its gotta be the running time which is a whooping 2 hours and 45 minutes long. Also the songs to their credit are good but they are sometimes in one ear and out the other. But having said that its a timeless classic that everyone must watch or own on DVD to add to their film collection. Sally Anne Howes reminds me of Julie Andrews as sometimes I thought it was her as she has the same accent and mannerisms as her. Dick Van Dyke was great as the over the top inventor Mr Potts who has to mind his two children on his own and befriends Truly later on in the film who joins him and his children in his new invention with the old banger. Keep an eye out for Barbara Windsor who was in Eastenders as Peggy Mitchell and also in some of the Carry On films.My overall rating is a 9/10. Classic,Chitty Chitty Bang Bang

However, the get the wrong person; his father! With the help of a toymaker(Benny Hill), the day is saved. Vulgaria with not put up with the king's tyranny anymore. Music is magic in this movie.

32,ptb-8,The ol' bang bang,7,8 January 2010,"Plenty of love from other people for this massive and entertaining 1968 musical fantasy, and most of it deservedly so. CCBB seems to build on the MARY POPPINS affection of 1964 and certainly is almost a sort of sequel. What I do love about CCBB is the spectacular qualities in the sets costumes art direction and glorious photography. The opening credit sequences with the numerous car races in various years and locations are a triumph of spending and film making without restraint. These 5 car races which establish CCBB's speed car history are massive and expensive vignettes simply to show back story and allow for the credits to appear. They are as big and elaborate as all of THE GREAT RACE. Once the film gets underway there are several terrific dance numbers, the most perfectly and abstract in design is the lolly factory and the Toot Sweet number. Great Caligari windows and stairs etc. However, after that the film becomes an afternoon nap fantasy to get the flying and chasing and Bavarian scenes underway. The film remains in some sort of storybook until the end. I found all this really odd when it really could simply have been a fantastic narrative anyway. It is as if there is no story so they invent a story about 30 minutes in. Whilst it is all gorgeous and funny and spectacular (esp. the castle interiors and Gert Frobe is hilarious) for me the film is at odds with itself. Yes it is for kids and families to enjoy together and yes I love that too; I guess what irritates me is that the bulk of the film's story is just made up by one character during the running time.

This movie is just terrible. I could only get ten minutes into it; with shrill and wearying child actors, god-awful songs and hackneyed plot points as far as the eye can see.

No matter where I stopped I couldn't bear more than a minute or so. It is unmercifully long. How could Rhoald Dahl have authored such a completely inept script?

35,JuguAbraham,Extension of the James Bond magic for the child in us,7,6 April 2003,"Many of us grew up on the James Bond movies, based on Ian Fleming's books. The books were trashy compared to the movies. Yet Fleming married science fiction with satire--science that was limited to gadgetry and bizarre warmongery. ""Chitty Chitty Bang Bang"" is an extension of the Bond magic for the child in us. Starting with producer of the Bond films, we even have 'Q' of the Bond movies the late Desmond Llewelyn. The only difference: 'Q' here (Coggins) is destructive not creative while the Bond equivalent (the Dick van Dyke character Caractacus Potts) is creative and not destructive like his cousin James. This film is really a toast to the imaginative mind of Fleming.Roald Dahl is the other genius who made what the film is today. Dahl is one of the finest children's storyteller and ""Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory"" is a sterling example of his genius. Dahl embellished Fleming's novel and gave us the lovely sidelights (bringing up kids who play truant, a car that gasps at the thought of being melted into liquid) that makes the film lovable 35 years after it was made. The human toy dance sequence (choreographed by Marc Breaux) is absolutely delectable.While the film may not be the finest children's musical it is brilliant in parts such as the toy dance sequence, some imaginative casting (Lionel Jefferies and James Robertson Justice, who make you recall their roles in the delectable Miss Marple movies) and finally the endearing presence of Dick Van Dyke, who acts half his age on screen.Van Dyke thought this movie would out-Disney the Disney movies and if you sift through the scenes, you will indeed see the adult world of Bond and Fleming, cleverly packaged as a children's musical film. Director Ken Hughes may not be a major director but he does achieve partial success with his casting (the adorable kids, the Child catcher, and, of course, Van Dyke) and some lovely music (Hushabye Mountain).",Chitty Chitty Bang Bang

There's also the unmistakable lyrically acrobatic musical chirpiness of the Sherman brothers, which is vintage Mary Poppins caliber.

But somewhere in the centre of the maelstrom of zaniness lies something fundamentally Chitty: adorably sweet and earnest amidst its heartfelt wackiness. And it's this that helps the film hold up much better than you'd expect - still a delight for children young and old even nearly forty years on. Attempting to summarize the film's increasingly off-the-rails plot reads like the story was written by one of its target audience (""and then the flying car and spies follow the sky-pirates to an evil Baron's kingdom full of toys!""), but it's clear that cohesion is far from the point. If anything, the film's halfhearted attempt to rationalize its fantasy interlude as a story-within-the-story feels both clumsy and disingenuous to its enjoyable whimsy. Still, there's too much fun being had to dwell on technicalities. And while Dahl cutting loose with silly abandon in his adventure for the ages is grandiose enjoyment, it's actually just as pleasant to hang out with Van Dyke's kooky inventory and his impressively adorable-but-not-annoying children (Adrian Hall and Heather Ripley), as he gets up to scientific mischief or simply sings about how he loves their family. But just when the proceedings of reconciling the heteronormative family unit skirt becoming too winsome, Dahl's wackiness comes crashing in to keep things breezy and bizarre. It helps, of course, that the film looks wonderful: Chitty herself is a gorgeous vehicle (even if the rear projection sequences of her driving or flying show their age). Fellow 007 veteran Ken Adam conjures spectacular sets grandiose enough for Goldfinger himself - Van Dyke's laboratory in particular is a labyrinth of contorted Seussian cogs and pipes. The sumptuous song and dance numbers complete the package, adding a stacked roster of perfectly heartwarming and hugely infections tunes to keep a smile on even the most curmudgeonly of faces. Still, it's the cast of characters that really keep the film afloat. Apart from the peerless, rubber-limbed, disarmingly grinning Dick Van Dyke at his most irresistibly charming, Sally Ann Howes' Truly Scrumptious (Dahl's poke at Fleming's goofy misogyny in naming female leads) showcases some impressive belting, as well as a welcome sweet side as her initial fussiness melts away. Supporting them are the most memorably zany crew of comedic relief this side of Python. Lionel Jeffries' prissy posturing as Van Dyke's garrulous grandfather is a dead ringer for Graham Chapman at his most side-splitting, particularly when scoffing an ode to British posh composure while being repeatedly dunked in the ocean swinging from a helicopter. Similarly, the delightful Gert Fröbe lampoons his Goldfinger villainy with stupendously silly gumption as the infantile Baron Bomburst; he even manages to sell his repeated attempts to casually murder his wife play as hilarious slapstick rather than as dubious as they'd sound. Alexander Doré and Bernard Spear's Spies punctuate scene transitions with sublime throwaway slapstick, while Robert Helpmann's leering Child Catcher is a vintage Dahl nightmare, verging on excessively creepy for his intended audience. Chitty Chitty Bang Bang may sputter throughout its jubilant refrains, with its 'kitchen sink' comedy and awkwardly motivated fantasy interjection toeing the limit of indulgent silliness. But in the same way that engine sputter has become one of the most iconic sound effects in cinema history, so has its eponymous car charmed its way into the hearts of generations - ramshackle but not rusty. So, whether reminiscing fondly through rosy nostalgia glasses or a new recruit, come and fly away with Chitty Chitty Bang Bang. As Van Dyke affirms, it's simply the pragmatic course of action. -8.5/10",Chitty Chitty Bang Bang

Sadly, I didn't. My parents D-R-A-G-G-E-D me to this one when I was a child. You see, they were under the impression that this was a musical every child should like. Well, this child adored ""Mary Poppins"" and ""The Sound of Music"", my parents, thought, ""Gee, she'd like this."" No, she did not.It was silly. It was stupid. These were two sentences I used in describing it. The musical numbers were terrible. The songs were un-memorable, except for the lead song. I didn't care if the guy made a broken down car that could fly and have other attachments. I am of the James Bond era of cars so this car to me was definately ""chitty"".The only saving grace to me watching this film is that my best friend got to see it with me and she had a speech impediment. She could not pronounce her ""c's"", ""s's"", ""f's"" and ""d's"" properly. So the other best memory I have of this mess was her subsituting the ""CH"" should for ""SH"".

43,rps-2,The whole is greater than its cliches,6,28 December 2003,"Chitty Chitty Bang Bang strings to-gether every gimmick, routine, plot line and cliche that's been used for the last fifty years. It's a thinly disguised clone of the hugely successful Mary Poppins, obviously designed to milk the same market with the same (or very similar) routines yet again. But despite its unoriginality, it works and works well. Cute kids with lovable British accents. A beautiful heroine. A blissfully incompetent hero. A laughable villain. A fairy tale kingdom in the thrall of a despotic bufoon. A setting in the supposedly more gracious era of pre 1914 Europe. (Forget the industrial slums, the gin mills, the gaols and  the gallows.) A lot of fun and fantasy. You could start out wanting to hate this movie for all these reasons but you would end by enjoying it despite yourself. Theres a bit of Charlie Chaplain and Laurel and Hardy, a lot of Mary Poppins and Walt Disney. And it is in the classic format pioneered by Disney; a story that entrances the kids while entertaining their parents, done in a such a way that it can be trotted out for a new generation every few years. And of course, they all live happily ever after. A hard movie not to like despite its weaknesses.",Chitty Chitty Bang Bang

This was one of them. Chitty Chitty Bang Bang tells the story about an inventor who creates a magical car that flies and floats. Starring Dick Van Dyke from Mary Poppins and Sally Ann Howes, this movie still holds up on its 50th anniversary. Yes it drags on for too long in its two hour length and the kids singing in Truly Scrumptious is really bad, but there are lots of things to like.The cinematography is gorgeous and imaginative especially the Baron's castle, the story is very imaginative it avoids having cliches in order to have characters that we can root for, and the characters are charming. Caractacus Potts is likeable and his chemistry with Truly Scrumptious, is really nice. Of course the film does have some dark moments especially with the Child Catcher who can easily frighten little kids and the world of Vulgaria has an atmospheric look when the idea of children being forbidden is mentioned. Also the other characters are charming too especially the kids Jeremy and Jemima, The Baron Bomburst, and the two spies who try to capture the car.And last but not least the songs and by golly are they memorable. The main title is great, Toot Sweets, Lovely Lonely Man, and Truly Scrumptious are great thanks to creative and beautiful lyrics from the Sherman Brothers who did the songs for some of the Disney films in the 60s and later decades.To those who haven't seen the film yet, check it out on Blu Ray or dvd and you'll have lots of fun! It has charm and magic that makes it recommended! :)",Chitty Chitty Bang Bang
45,Atreyu_II,I'm afraid it wasn't what I was expecting,5,29 January 2011,"I watched this thinking it was a Disney film. And indeed, to a point it seems like one. I am sure that more people besides me confounded this with Disney stuff and I can see why would it be confounded with Disney material. The first half of the movie and even about 1/4 of the second half follows the Disney formula, being generally fun and charming in an old-fashioned Disney-like way. Besides, the songs are by the famous Sherman Brothers, the movie stars Dick Van Dyke , Sally Ann Howes even looks like Julie Andrews and the idea of the flying vintage car comes from a previous Disney film named 'The Absent-Minded Professor' (which I never saw).But there comes a time when the Disney similarities end and it becomes dull and of bad taste. Doesn't combine with the light-hearted nature of the rest of the thing. All those barons and clown-like villains and such in Vulgaria. The Child Catcher... argh, what a grotesque and horrible man! Poor of those children who are his prisoners! Vulgaria is nothing less than Bavaria (in Germany) and its magnificent Neuschwanstein Castle. Which means absolutely gorgeous cinematography, also filmed in spectacular angles of sight. What a shame the rest of the story doesn't combine with the wonderful beauty of this scenario! I think the movie is only good until the sequence of the picnic on the beach with the Potts family and Truly. Well, not until that part, but until shortly after that, even though there are a few things of bad taste earlier in the film.The reason of the movie's title is because that's how the magical vintage car is named. And the reason why the car is named so is because of the sounds its engine makes: that's what ""she"" really sounds like: Chitty Chitty Bang Bang! I love the song 'Chitty Chitty Bang Bang', it's very cute and charming.I mentioned before that Sally Ann Howes looks like Julie Andrews. Actually, Julie Andrews was the actress originally chosen to play the part of Truly but she turned down the part.Here, Dick Van Dyke doesn't seem to have the cockney accent he has in 'Mary Poppins', however he's got an awesome name on this one: Caractacus Potts! :) It's one of those names that make me grin instantly, it sounds so amusing and hilarious! :D Dick Van Dyke is great. The two kids are pretty good and they're cute. The little boy even looks like Sean Marshall (Pete from ""Pete's Dragon""). Truly... LOL! What kind of name is Truly? I hope no one named their daughters Truly after this, LOL.",Chitty Chitty Bang Bang

One of the best aspects of this film has got to be the music. The tunes are catchy and memorable. Although the film is pretty good, it isn't the best Disney film. And, the theatre production is much better. (Unfortunately, they have stopped showing this in London now, but the theatre production brought the story to life much more than the film ever did and ever could.) Overall, not a bad film, but I wouldn't recommend it over some of Disney's other films. However, I have and would continue to recommend the play in London had they not stopped showing it.",Chitty Chitty Bang Bang
47,barryrd,Classic musical fairy tale,8,22 August 2021,"I watched this show with my wife and seven year old grandson. We thoroughly enjoyed it. Dick Van Dyke and Sally Ann Howes work very well together as the co-stars. Dick Van Dyke is at his peak a short time after his success in Mary Poppins, which no doubt helped inspire this movie. Van Dyke is a tremendous comedy and dancing talent, who plays a loving father and an inventor extraordinaire, The inventions themselves are great fun for children and adults both. Sally Ann Howes is a perfect fit for the character of Truly Scrumptious with a her superb performance and beautiful voice. I was surprised to learn that Chitty Chitty Bang Bang was adapted from a story written by Ian Fleming, of James Bond fame. Nevertheless, under Bond producer Albert Broccoli, this is a great children's movie with lots of appeal for the same adults who also appreciate the production values of the Bond movies - a very different movie genre. The beautiful sets and costumes, dancing, airborne scenes and wonderful seaside settings off the south coast of England give this movie a strong and enduring appeal.",Chitty Chitty Bang Bang
48,Isaac5855,"It's no MARY POPPINS, but it's still a childhood favorite",7,5 January 2007,"CHITTY CHITTY BANG BANG was a splashy and lushly mounted musical, based on a children's book by Ian Fleming (!)which the producers were hoping would strike the same gold as MARY POPPINS but wasn't nearly as good. Dick Van Dyke, four years after MARY POPPINS, stars as Caractacus Potts, an eccentric inventor with two small children, who buys and restores an old car and through story he tells his children, becomes a magical car that can float on water and fly in the air. Just as he was in MARY POPPINS, Van Dyke is the only American actor among an all-English cast (though he wisely doesn't attempt an accent this time) in this fluffy children's musical that children can still get pleasure from; however, for most of us who grew up on it, has not aged too well. The lackluster songs are by Richard M.and Robert B. Sherman who also wrote the songs for MARY POPPINS and the dances are choreographed by POPPINS choreographers Marc Breaux and DeeDee Wood. Sally Ann Howes is a lovely leading lady with a Bond-girl-type character name, Truly Scrumptious. James Robertson Justice plays her father, a candy manufacturer, Benny Hill is a toymaker, Gerte Frobe(GOLDFINGER) plays an evil baron who loves to play with toys and Anna Quayle plays his children-hating baroness. There's also a delightful turn by Lionel Jeffries as Van Dyke's equally eccentric grandfather.

I know this is based upon a book written by Ian Fleming for his young son, and does not much follow it, just as Disney's ""Pinocchio"" didn't much follow Collodi's original. I rented it out of curiosity; how good was this movie? This movie has gotten mixed reviews here, which is no surprise to me. On the one hand, the car looks delightful and the scenery, if not the special effects, are good. The villains who kidnap the car and its owners are scary, especially when our heroes are in Vulgaria and note that there are no children around, and we are relieved when they get their comeuppance. The part where the Baron's henchmen fall into the sea and have to swim to their country-only to have to swim away when they reach it, is hilarious. On the other hand, Dick Van Dyke is supposed to be English and he sounds American, none of the songs are memorable, and the movie is overlong.Overall, it's probably not the first thing you want to take your children to see.

53,michaelarmer,My Childhood,9,5 February 2020,"One of the greatest children's films ever, it is part of my upbringing and I still watch it as an adult, it still looks great.Made by the same team who did the James Bond movies using the same quality techniques, and the original story written by the same author Ian Fleming, and although not faithful to it, the screenplay was written by Roald Dahl and is excellent.The acting was superb, well almost, Dick Van Dyke refused to do an English accent, because of the complaints he received after doing one poorly in Mary Poppins, so it was odd that an American was the son of a British soldier, but otherwise was great, especially as the Mannequin doing a dance, Sally Ann Howes was great as Truly Scrumptious, and has the most beautiful singing voice, apparently they wanted Julie Andrews, but for me Sally's performance was always better, more beautiful and is a more superb singer, so they landed well with her. The kids did Ok, good acting for children of their ages, although Heather Ripley did not continue acting and Adrian Hall who did a bit of TV, soon stopped also, but they were lovely.The excellent support and cameo actors did great, Robert Helpmann (an Australian Dancer) was brilliant as the Childcatcher, one of the scariest performances for children, ever! With Benny Hill, Lionel Jeffries, Anna Quayle, James Robertson Justice, Barbara Windsor, Desmond Llewellyn, Gert Frobe (both of 007 fame), Arthur Mullard, Davy Kaye, Victor Maddern, Peter Arne, Max Wall and Stanley Unwin all contributing well in their Cameos.Direction was excellent, although the director Ken Hughes did not appear to like his job, he did it well and the scenes and photography are beautiful, using authentic (although it is a fantasy) locations in England, Austria and Germany.My favourite scenes are Benny Hill Toymaker/The Childcatcher in the German Town of Rothenburg-ob-de-Tauber, the Children invading the Castle (Schloss Neuschwanstein), Charactacus Potts inventions in his house, Lionel Jeffries singing in the outside toilet as he dips into the sea, and the Mannequin dance in the castle (apparently done in one take), although really every scene is great.One of the best, if not the best, Children's Fantasy movies, please don't spoil it and make a sequel or re-make.",Chitty Chitty Bang Bang

55,TheHonestCritic,"This is, without a doubt, the best live action family/children film in cinematic history. (TAKE THAT, DISNEY STUDIOS!)",10,4 July 2019,"*FIRST A LITTLE BACKSTORY ABOUT MY ORIGINAL DISCOVERY OF THIS MOVIE.*It all began with a glorious accident. Back when I was in preschool, my teacher had me and the rest of the class watch ""Mary Poppins"" (1964) during inside recess one day. We didn't finish it during the first viewing, my teacher put it back on about a week later and we finished the movie. After school, I begged my mother to buy me the movie on videotape. When she went to go buy it, the store happened to be sold out of ""Mary Poppins"" videos. So she bought me a ""Chitty Chitty Bang Bang"" (1968) tape instead. I immediately changed my opinion about ""Mary Poppins"". Words cannot describe how much I thanked my mother after I first watched ""Chitty Chitty Bang Bang"" for buying that movie instead of ""Mary Poppins"", I fell in love with it right away! As I watched it, I said out loud within the first 20 minutes: ""this movie is much better!"" As much as I enjoy watching ""Mary Poppins"", I have to say, in my opinion, ""Chitty Chitty Bang Bang"" blows that movie out of the water. *End of my backstory*.MY OFFICIAL REVIEW FOR ""CHITTY CHITTY BANG BANG"":""Chitty Chitty Bang Bang"" (1968) is a sheer delight, phenomenal is too weak a word to describe this movie. It's one of my top 10 favorite movies of all-time! Saying that this is a phenomenal movie is an understatement. Whenever someone mentions ""family movie"", or ""children's movie"", the first film that comes into my mind is ""Chitty Chitty Bang Bang"". Every time! This is another example of what I consider a perfect movie. Here's an interesting topic about this movie: it was based off a book written by the late, but great, Ian Fleming; the author of the original James Bond novels. This movie is also made by the company that produces the James Bond movies, how about that? From the look of the cinematography, it actually looks and has the feel of a traditional Bond movie, which really helps it to stand out unlike any family/children's film in cinema. Another thing, this movie does not follow the narrative of the original ""Chitty Chitty Bang Bang"" book. The film story is almost the polar opposite of it. Normally, changing the story from the original book, or novel, would ruin the story of the film. However, this movie is one of those rare examples where changing the original story to adapt it to the big screen actually works. It works very well, it's a risky move to change an original story to fit movie standards. But sometimes, you have to take big risks for big rewards, and the gamble definitely paid off. I have read the original novel, it is entertaining, but not nearly as entertaining as the story they adapted for the movie! Everything is top-notch, the acting is phenomenal, the special effects are fantastic and still hold up today (TAKE THAT, CGI!), the story is a fun and thrilling adventure, the sets and locations are absolutely beautiful, and the soundtrack? What can I say, but one of the best soundtracks in cinematic history. The soundtrack is one of the most memorable parts of this film. I'll let you in on a little secret, I'm not a big fan of musicals overall. But ""Chitty Chitty Bang Bang"" is one of those rare ones that I absolutely adore! ""Chitty Chitty Bang Bang"" is a movie for any generation, people of all ages can enjoy it. If you have children, be sure you show them this movie if you haven't already. I guarantee you, that you'll have the happiest children on Earth! I know I was happy beyond belief to find out that this movie exists, and I'm still happy it does! To this day, I still watch it. It never gets old! I can't give this movie enough praise, words can't describe how much I love this film. I can watch this movie on loop over and over again and never get tired of it. No matter how old you are, this movie is guaranteed to put a big smile on your face! Obviously, I give it 5 out of 5 stars on my personal scale, which equates to 10 out of 10 IMDB stars. All I can say is, if you haven't seen this movie, it's not too late to see it, no matter your age. Go watch it, and take flight into your wildest imaginations!",Chitty Chitty Bang Bang
56,aramis-112-804880,Half a Classic,8,22 April 2017,"Albert Broccoli, who produced the James Bond movies, wanted Bond-author Ian Fleming's kids' book, CHITTY CHITTY BANG BANG, to be a classic like ""Mary Poppins."" To achieve this, he hired the songwriters and choreographers from ""Poppins"" as well as its lead adult actor, Dick van Dyke. What even his deep pockets couldn't buy, however, was Julie Andrews, who that year preferred making the world-shaking classic (sarcasm) ""Star!"" What Broccoli also couldn't buy was charm. Disney's ""Poppins"" had it, ""Chitty Chitty Bang Bang"" lacks it.""Chitty"" has lots going for it. Tuneful songs, of which ""Chitty Chitty Bang Bang"" itself may be the best (and is always inspiring). ""The Roses of Success"" is a wonderful comic, but also instructive, song, and amusingly done by the grandfather and a group of weird inventors. ""The Old Bamboo"" is toe-tapping, as is ""Toot-Sweets."" But ""Hushabye Mountain"" (though the sort of thing my father sang to me) is a drag.The cast is half-wonderful. Dick van Dyke lost the cockney accent that got him so despised in ""Poppins"" but he looks . . . strange. Sally Ann Howes is a good singer, but lacks charisma. If Broccoli wanted a ""Poppins"" like movie he should have studied the ugly kids from the earlier flick, who are far more realistic and genuinely cute (and better actors) than the blonde, blue-eyed Aryan nonentities of ""Chitty."" They're the major flaw in the picture.The casting coup was Lionel Jeffries, stealing every scene he's in as the grandfather. Everything from his walk to the way he moves his neck and the way he reads every line is funny (and I've been watching the movie for fifty years, being 8 when it first came out). He also has the song ""P.O.S.H."" (port out, starboard home). Everything he does in this movie in lovely.And while in ""Poppins"" the only bad guy was the father (who wasn't really bad, only distracted), ""Chitty"" produces one of the great screen villains, who haunted my nightmares as a kid, the infamous Child-Catcher (limned by dancer/choreographer Robert Helpmann). He's a perfect villain who will linger in kids' memories forever, though some of his menace may be lost on the small screen.The movie also features superb comic turns by Gert Frobe (a skilled comedian in Germany before becoming the perfect ""Goldfinger"") and 5'10"" Anna Quayle.Possibly using the late-1960s ethos, the Vulgarian sequence ends with a kid-led revolution. After all, it was the 60s young people who took Lenin's Birthday and turned it into Earth Day. They were all about revolution and killing.So with so much good, why doesn't ""Chitty"" rank with ""Poppins""? Perhaps because of the kids, whom I disliked when I was their age. Either the writers, director or producer made a few wrong choices (for instance, the kids laughing when Dick van Dyke's rocket doesn't work . . . when people on screen laugh at on screen antics, the audience doesn't, even I as a film layman know that). The lack of Julie Andrews (who was courted for the part) can't be considered, as we don't know how she'd have done in the role of Truly Scrumptious and because she proved with ""Star!"" and ""Darling Lili"" and others that even her marvelous talents can't overcome weak material.Personally, I think it's because while the first part of the movie (putting Chitty together and riding off in her singing the great ""Chitty Chitty Bang Bang"" song) and the Vulgarian sequences don't really gel. It's even worse (SPOILERS) in that by the end it's clear the Vulgarian sequence that scared the hell out of me and every child in the world never happened. It's like being told a lie, when what you see on screen looks so much like the truth. Therefore the ending in a more mundane world is a bit of a come-down. Though it is a relief to know Benny Hill's toymaker didn't exist, either. Hill looks like Captain Kangaroo, which is good as we all loved the Captain, but acts like a rejected sketch from his own TV show.Too, despite the best work of Helpmann, Frobe and Quayle, and the wonderfully sinsiter waltz near the end, some of the Vulgarian sequences almost cry out for Graham Chapman to come in shouting, ""Too silly!"" The movie has many good shots (especially the end, when the credits roll) and some excellent cutting (esp. in the races at the beginning). The music is good enough. Helpmann is scary, Jeffries is hilarious. Van Dyke is fatherly . . . but we miss his ease of manner and his carelessness about life from ""Poppins."" A better performance may have been thwarted by his alcoholism, but he shows no trace of it on screen. But Howes, whose screen career goes back to at least 1945 as a child herself, and her operatic tones are fine, and whose expressions in the beginning are well-considered, isn't a screen-shaker.Perhaps the biggest trouble is the director doesn't seem to have any sympathy with the material. Dick van Dyke (quoted on this site) said he didn't seem to like kids. Maybe that, ultimately, is why the movie comes up just short of being one of the great classics. Or maybe it's that producer Broccoli, who was great for Bond, simply lacked the Disney touch. Or, going back to first causes, perhaps Fleming (whose book is vastly different but bizarre in its own way) wasn't a kids' writer at heart.In another plus, we get to see Desmond Llewellyn (Bond's ""Q"") as the junk man in the beginning. And, best of all, we all love Chitty.",Chitty Chitty Bang Bang
57,tributarystu,My Reason to Love Chitty,8,16 September 2005,"Loving movies inevitably positions yourself (in this particular case, myself) in a vicious circle. One of my greatest regrets was seeing classics like Alien when I was so very young and understood so very little of it. I won't say it ruined my second, third and fourth viewings, but I'd have given anything for a Lacuna Inc. treatment at that time.All my thoughts on Chitty blossomed while watching it again. I thoroughly enjoyed the silliness of the script, the quirky characters and the occasionally terrible failures in putting some decent images together. It was as though I was reliving this wonderful time of my childhood - my early childhood, if I may say so - because I saw and ""resaw"" Chitty loads of times when I was about six or seven. As every amazing story, mine has its own twist: at some point in my private history, someone recorded I don't know what ^*&#%@! wedding exactly over the middle of the movie. Ever since, I felt this strange urge of reminding myself what I was missing.I'm sure this film doesn't appeal to everyone. It's a bit childish of me to react as delighted after viewing it again as it's way too personal to be objective. But maybe a film that makes one feel these things has a value of its own. Chitty Chitty Bang Bang is definitely overlong and I can't imagine anyone making me sit through it now, had I not seen it before.

Everything is also deeply English, from the rolling pastoral backgrounds to the grandfather in a pith helmet who thinks he's in India having tea with the Maharaja. Unfortunately, after the cliff-hanging intermission there are a lot fewer surprises and the plot becomes a more conventional kid-power narrative of the type that infects so many contemporary G-rated features.

The plot is easy to follow. it's silly slapstick with a couple of great songs mixed in.The scenery is eye catching and don't forget that awesome car!

61,BadWebDiver,My fav movie as a kid.,10,16 March 2002,"This is the film I most enjoyed as a kid. I first got the books by Ian Fleming out of the school library. And while the film doesn't follow the books very closely (the script is a virtually new rewrite by famed author Roald Dahl); this fun, dynamic whimsical story by the makers of MARY POPPINS and the Bond films completely captivated me.I have heard of people still frightened by the Child-Catcher character (played by Australian ballet dancer Robert Helpmann); and considering the worst thing you see him do is lock children in cages, it's quite an impressive achievement. (Of course, it is implied that he kills children.) And when you see the scene where the Baron sings a corny love song to the Baroness while secretly trying to kill her, you realize that this works on more levels than just a cute kiddie's story.I still rank the Toots Sweet number as one of the best staging in cinema musicals, rivaling Busby Berkley. And the recreation of silent movie gags with the two spies and Lord Scrumptious adds to the delight. There's also the subtle pun of Grandpa going to his ""laboratory/lavatory"" (geddit?); and a host of other sly references.All in all, still a top class family entertainment story. By the way; I think there may be room for a remake that ties more closely to the original story about British-French gunrunners. Perhaps as a tele-movie?",Chitty Chitty Bang Bang
62,Marta,Exceptional film that's vastly under-appreciated,10,15 July 2001,"""Chitty Chitty Bang Bang"" is a 70mm film; a modern audience can't see it on TV today and truly understand why it was a hit in 1968, and remembered so fondly by us 40-50ish adults.  If you saw it on a wide screen in 1968, like I did as an 11-year-old at the Astro Theatre in Omaha, it was delightful and overpowering.  The dark theatre, the glow of the screen, the wonderful scenes of the English countryside during the day and as the sun set, the magnificence of the newly-refurbished old car as it is wheeled out of the dark garage accompanied by a swell of the evocative theme music, and the panoramic view of Neuschwanstein Castle, left an impression on me that lingers today.  This is a film that cries out for wide screen theatre re-release, and if it were we'd have a whole generation of children who would fall in love with it again.  Tiny, box-like megaplexes have stolen a lot of the grandeur from the film-going experience, which is a terrible loss to us, the film-going public.While I usually agree with most of his reviews, I'm going to take violent exception to Leonard Maltin's review of this film (as I do with his inexplicably bad review of the fantastic 1980 film ""Popeye""). This film has an outstanding score that I've remembered for 32 years, and excellent special effects that fit very much within the timeframe of the film, which is why they are done the way they are done.  The score is by Richard and Robert Sherman, who create songs just as memorable as they did 4 years earlier in ""Mary Poppins.""  The title song and main theme have stayed with me all these years, and I sometimes find myself singing it for no apparent reason.  ""Posh"" is a comic masterpiece and Lionel Jeffries was a perfect choice to sing it.  ""Hushabye Mountain"" is a lovely lullaby, and ""Chu-chi Face"" is hilarious.  ""Me Ol' Bamboo"" is an wonderful, energetic production number akin to the Chimney Sweep song in Mary Poppins, and ""The Roses of Success"" has long been a favorite of mine.  And the duet between Van Dyke and Howe when they posed as a marionette and music box dancer, respectively, is just about my favorite part of the film.Dick Van Dyke is perfect as the inventor; Sally Anne Howe is a lovely singer and a competent actress, but doesn't have the screen presence Julie Andrews does.  That's the only detriment to the major casting of the film.  Gert Frobe and Anna Quayle are delightful standouts as the evil and spoiled King and Queen Bomburst; their time on screen is far too short.  My only quibble is that the film is a trifle too long, and one of the earlier musical numbers could have been cut.  Other than that it's perfect.This is a great film that deserves to be seen by everyone in the way it was intended - on a wide, wide screen in glowing 70mm with stereo sound.  If you've never seen it in that fashion, you're missing an essential movie experience.",Chitty Chitty Bang Bang
63,movibuf1962,"Sometimes bumpy, but always magical.",8,30 June 2003,"Fantasy movies are always a tricky sell to audiences- especially modern-day cynics, and that will probably never cease. But there are green-lights to be mentioned in CCBB. I never read the book (which I imagine literary purists will hang me for), but what I found in the film was very satisfying. I never thought it was too long. (Perhaps I thought that once, but I was probably eight at the time.) On the other hand I was captivated with its story-within-a-story narrative. It's really two plots- the first, more 'serious' one showing how the family retrieves and restores the car lasts a little over the first hour of the movie. But after presenting the burlesque delight 'Old Bamboo,' the Berkeleyesque extravaganza 'Toot Sweets,' and the breathtaking lullaby 'Hushabye Mountain,' the film blurs reality with fantasy- a'la ""The Wizard of Oz-"" and dives into a completely spontaneous fairytale, with Nazi party overtones, and peaking with the title song and Act 1 finale of Sally Ann Howes' ""Lovely, Lonely Man."" I think it's a scream that so many people post to collectively hate this number for no apparent reason- when it further showcases the brilliant plot staging halfway through the film. (Is this part of the movie or the story being told at the picnic?) Other musical pluses are ""Music Box,"" ""The Roses of Success,"" and ""P-O-S-H.""",Chitty Chitty Bang Bang

It must be a generation thing. For a two and a half hour film I wasn't bored for a second, although the scenes with the baron's two spies were a mistake and seemed to belong to a different film. At least half the songs are classics that every ""kid"" of my age know instantly. Some of the humour is quite dark and the child catcher is still rather frightning.

The film is quite clever and has some fantastic performances.  Even at my advanced age of 38, Robert Helpman as the Child Catcher still scares the you know what out of me. This film was certainly well cast.As per usual with every Sherman Brothers' score though there are typically a couple of great songs and then a few that are forgetable.  It is a shame that ""Hushabye Mountain"" isn't included in the DVD Sing-a-long as it is probably the best song in the whole movie, even above the title track.

Maybe I was too cynical back then, maybe we all were. The songs apart from the title number are not that memorable, in fact a couple are pretty awful but they are delivered with great gusto by the cast that you quite enjoy it. I think the effects are absolutely satisfactory, more remarkable when you remember that this was all pre computer days. I loved the car. The cast is great and Sally Ann Howes is a revelation, what a perfectly delicious performance. Van Dyke as always is delightful. The kids are a bit annoying but you get over that once the brilliant Robert Helpman as the child catcher comes on. Helpman steals the film. Its a graceful astonishingly scary performance. Its a great way to scare off annoying brats. I loved revisiting Chitty chitty bang bang. Nice to see the great Benny Hill and Gert Frobe and Lionel Williams again. A magical delight and if you have not seen it in years you will enjoy it. It was given a very hard time by critics but the public adored it.

71,jwrowe3,"Long, but Like-able!",8,2 August 2003,"When this movie was in it's first theatrical release, I was seven,the age it was aimed at. I didn't see it on the big screen, but on TV in the 1970'sI'd describe this as one of the last of the really big, old school musical movies. Lots of big musical numbers, large cast, big set. But that style of movie was losing steam, and a more spare and gritty style of movie was coming. However, give me ""Chitty"" over ANY Disney live action movie of the same period. I remember reading the book when I was young, so when CCBB popped up on TV, I looked forward to seeing it.(Remember those days long before VCR's DVD's, and cable TV, when you got to watch something once, and hope you didn't miss it, or have to wait forever, perhaps, to see it again) The book and the movie do have some differences.++Spoilers of a Minor Kind++I watched CCBB not long ago with my young daughters, and was surprised at how long this movie was. I'll bet when it was shown on TV, back in the old days, it either went over two nights or was heavily edited for time. A few of the songs could have been ditched, as I think they are filler. Dick Van Dyke, IS, however the best part of this movie. All his numbers are a delight to watch, and I'll not waste space saying what most earlier posters like about his part, as I agree!It's fun seeing two Bond characters turn up, in totally ""un-Bond"" roles. Would have been even better if somehow, more of the 007 regular characters would have had cameo roles, or bit parts. Maybe ""M"" or Miss Moneypenny popping in. Ah well.... It took us two nights to take in the whole movie, as ""the yawn factor"" came into play at about the halfway point of the movie, and two sleepy eyed young ladies asked me to ""let us watch the rest tomorrow, daddy"".A great movie for a slow, rainy, indoor day.",Chitty Chitty Bang Bang

I really wish the musicals would come back. So what if they were unrealistic and kitsch and blah blah blah? They were also beautiful and uplifting, unlike all the apocalyptic, chainsaw-slashing trash today. Call me nostalgic, but I miss the innocence and just outright FUN. People sneer at naivety today, but I cannot honestly remember a happier time than that. But I digress....Chitty was a spectacular fantasy about a poor family lead by an insanely inventive patriarch, Caractacus Potts (crackpot- get it? haha). The inventions are really fun to watch, the songs are catchy and well sung (Toot Sweets is my favorite) and I always wanted a car just like Chitty. I thought Sally Anne Howes was lovely as Truly (thought i never got she was truly scrumptious until much later). Dick Van Dyke is a fav., though I was always wierded out since everyone but him had British accents. I guess he got raked too hard for his whole Burt-accent-disaster. The Rat Catcher was great!

80,berberian00-276-69085,Ian Fleming Wrote Books for Children ...,10,16 January 2014,"I dedicate this piece of writing to Ian Fleming (1908-1964), the ingenious creator of 007 James Bond and also to all those defectors from the East that made the world beautiful today - cf., ""Chitty Chitty Bang Bang"" (1968). Since I don't want to miss an opportunity with each of 23 individual Movies from the Bond's series, I decided to place my reference for Ian Fleming in the paragraph with his less popular hero Caractacus Potts and his flying automobile. So putting it bluntly ""Hollywood can no longer make movies like that because they no longer know how ... (cited from another reviewer). True or false, Movies for Children with fantastic element in it hadn't been so many in circulation for the mentioned period in the 1960s and 1970s (when I was a growing kid) - here I could point out ""Wonderful World of Brothers Grimm"" (1962), ""Mary Poppins"" (1964), ""Doctor Dolittle"" (1967), ""Pippi Longstocking"" (1969) with sequels, and maybe some other that I don't remember.Opinion research on Ian Fleming and his hero James Bond is something else. Fleming, who worked for Reuters as journalist, was recruited by British Foreign Service to do some coverage for espionage trials - particularly, when after 1947 it became highly popular for government officials from the Eastern Bloc to desert West with some classified information. In the country where I live, Bulgaria, ""show trials"" were made for Traicho Kostov and Nikola Petkov both sentenced to death. This was the beginning of Cold War, per se. Leakage happened from West-to-East also, when Rosenberg family divulged secret for A-bomb to the Russians. The World was never going to be same as before. Conventional war started and Combat battle on front-line was history. Can you believe this, some 3000 years after the Trojan War!Now get on grounds and pay tribute to Ian Fleming, the Colossus of espionage novel. He didn't have pretensions to have invented sullenly his hero James Bond. In fact, the 14 novels that were written for Agent 007 (i.e., ""license to kill in the line of duty"") took Fleming only 10 years and ruined respectively his health. He was heavy drinker and smoker; he died age 56. That was not bad age to die after making millions and also the phenomenon ""compression of mortality"" was not yet known.I want to complement at end few words on the prototype Spy that Fleming used for his novels. Firstly comes Sidney Reilly (1873-1925) - viz., a notorious adventurer (born as Solomon Rosenblum) in tsarist Russia, who worked for London at least 20 years before executed by the Bolsheviks. The second prototype Spy whom I didn't see mentioned is Oleg Penkovsky (1919-1963). Fleming shouldn't have missed his dossier if he was involved with Foreign Service coverage. Oleg Penkovsky, a colonel with Soviet Military Intelligence, defected to London in the 1950s. He and his contact person Greville Wynne (from MI5) were caught in 1963 and put to trial, where Penkovsky was sentenced to death and Greville Wynne to 8 years in prison (as foreign subject, he was released in 1965 for exchange to another double agent Sgt. Jack Dunlap, an American who spied for U.S.S.R.) Whatever, it is evident from ""Penkovskiy Papers: The Russian Who Spied for the West, New York, 1966"" that he leaked top secret for at least 5 years before dying. So, the Cuban Missile Crisis and the Assassination of President John F. Kennedy could be traced directly to this defective line. Thank you!",Chitty Chitty Bang Bang
81,VADigger,A movie that tries to hard?,6,25 June 2021,"In an attempt to ""out Disney Disney"", the producers of this film made the mistake of valuing lavishness over charm, incident over story, caricature over character.

Van Dyke even gets another cockney inflected dance number. But unlike ""Poppins"", there is no real heart to this movie, no lesson to be learned.The songs, with the exception of the ludicrously infectious title tune, are largely forgettable and several of the numbers just seem to take up time.

I put it on last night for my other two kids, who are 10 & 5, well they loved it. Watched it again the very next day. My teenage son even sat in and watched it too. They sing the theme song now while driving. 
The only bad point to me is that it's a very long movie and it can seem a little slow at times. Probably not a bad thing to a kid though, mine never complained.
They asked questions about ""the olden days"" as it's onviously set even many years before it was made. I loved the questions and the insight into a different time of story telling. He movie was at least 25 years old when I saw it and it seemed old to me then. But I loved it.

84,nEoFILM,Rose tinted glasses...,7,31 October 2011,"This was the first time that I've seen this children's classic since I was a child, and I suppose that I'd hoped that it would live up to its reputation. In all fairness though, I din't like it that much when I was a child, if I'm honest and my children, though some DO like it, others seemed to have mixed feelings. At best, it's likable but never lovable and at worst, it just isn't liked at all.So, as an adult I watched this loose adaptation of James Bond's, Ian Flemming's novel, with every good intention, but in the end was left disappointed. Firstly, at 2 hours and 20 minutes long, it feels like an epic, and a completely unnecessary one at that. Its intermission is turned into a Batfink or Adam West's Batman styled cliffhanger rather than a thematic or narrative break that it traditionally should have been, even going so far as to recap the action in the second act!The songs weren't great either, generally bordering on tedium rather than holding my interest. The story seems to be a little off kilter too, with a seemingly fatal crash destroying the eponymous car before its eventual restoration by Dick van Dyke. This was the culmination of a five-minute title sequence showcasing the early Grand Prix's of 1907 and '08 which for a family film seemed to drag somewhat.But after an hour of songs and character development, we finally take off in the flying car to the fantasy land of Vulgaria, only for the whole experience to be a fantastical story told by Van Dyke's, Caractacus Potts! All in all, this was a strange film, but not in an entertaining way like Willy Wonka's Chocolate Factory, the connection being Roald Dahl's involvement with the screenplay, but in a rather boring way, with events just seeing to happen without any really cause or need. One hour of story, then another one of fantasy. How many other films can boast this kind narrative twist and get away with it. It just seemed to be indulgent and plodding.It would defiantly have been improved if the car was actually magical and did actually take them on this adventure rather than suggesting that it is perfectly okay to sing and dance around the real world but it's a stretch too far to have a flying car! It should have been a fantasy through and through rather than six of one and half a dozen of the other.Ultimately, Overrated in my opinion and since the view of FOUR children, boys and girls ranging from 7 – 15, is that it's watchable rather than fully enjoyable, I suspect that this film is being viewed through rose tinted glasses.",Chitty Chitty Bang Bang

It is a fantastic plot of wonder and amazement that you would expect only from Walt Disney, and the fact that its not is a surprise.

Howes looked very nice and younger than her 37 years, but unfortunately she couldn't act at all. In fact, her ""acting"" made Dick Van Dyke look like Laurence Olivier. Van Dyke wisely only accepted the lead role of an eccentric inventor on the basis that he would not have to attempt an English accent, following all the criticism of his God-awful ""Cockney"" accent in Mary Poppins. Van Dyke is likable enough here but he couldn't sing - unsurprisingly since he was an alcoholic at the time and smoked 60 cigarettes a day. James Robertson Justice, the poor man's Peter Ustinov, wisely doesn't take it seriously. The whole movie goes on for far too long and most of the songs are completely forgettable. The song by the two annoying children should have been cut, since neither of them could sing. The ""Lovely Lonely Man"" number should have been cut as well because it completely slows down the film. Perhaps worst of all though, the flying sequences are very poor (especially by today's standards) so the audience never gets transported at all.

(Cubby) Broccoli (who produced all of the Bond movies up to License To Kill) would be handed the production. Lots of Cubby's James Bond associates helped on this movie, including Richard Maibaum (additional writing), Ken Adam (production design), Peter Lamont (art director), Vic Armstrong (stunts) and many others. This was not a Disney production, in fact Dick Van Dyke was quoted as saying, ""this film will out-Disney Disney"". For this he was banished from future Disney productions. Even Desmond Llewelyn (James Bond's ""Q"" for many years) has a role. This movie still holds up well... It was filmed in 70mm Super Panavision, with a 2.20:1 aspect ratio, and the Technicolor is fabulous. The plot does drag along at times and it does have too many musical numbers. Although the music was written by the Sherman brothers (who wrote music and lyrics to Mary Poppins), many times the music doesn't move the story along, thus it comes to a grinding halt. At 2 hours and 24 minutes, it's tough to get the kiddies to stay interested (I say kill about 45 minutes of the unnecessary music), but this movie is still magical. If it was judged on it's own merits, rather than being constantly compared to Mary Poppins, it would fare much better.

Funny, I did noticethat when I was five...The songs by the unstoppable ShermanBros. and the kinetic energy of Dick Van Dyke make this a realtreat. SADLY, the DVD has only been released in a PAN & SCANformat, utterly destroying some of the nicest widescreencompositions ever. If you can find it, grab the MGM/UA Laserdisc!!",Chitty Chitty Bang Bang
91,arc_a2007,One word: enormous,8,27 September 2009,"Chitty Chitty Bang Bang is one of those movies I grew up on. I've seen it so many times that no matter how long I wait, I remember everything that happens. In all honesty, I HATE some of the musical numbers the theme song is repeated way too much and the film really could have gone without ""Truly Scrumptious"" and ""Lovely Lonely Man"". But I do have a soft spot for ""Roses of Success"". But that's not why I like this film. I like it because it's enormous. It takes the viewer so many places and does so many things, all within two and a half hours. Sure, a big slice of the film is a giant detour of a daydream, but that's not a disadvantage when there's so much to see. It's the ride that counts after all, and this one is rife with fantasy, music, humor, tender moments and visual flair. This is a classic that deserves to be one.",Chitty Chitty Bang Bang
92,nihao,Maltin's may sour this milk!,9,25 November 2007,"Recently skipped through a past Leonard Maltin Film Review 'bible' and was almost disgusted to see the he (or one of his hacks) gave the movie in question 1 1/2 stars! It claims the Music delivers no memorable song, and that the Special Effects stink. I saw this movie back in 1971 in an Austrian Cinema. It was dubbed. The song went ""...Hei! Ho! Shitty Shitty Bank bank..."" (sic)but still... It was a memorable experience. Since, I have seen the film countless times now, with my two kids and we all adore it, and sing along to its MANY great songs. The 'special' effects are charming, and appeal to children, as their 'collage' quality arouses a suspension of disbelief... which is more POWERFUL.. and just what children want! Anyone who enjoyed Mary Poppins, will find many similarities between the two films, as, much of the cast and crew were shared, as well as more than a couple of Dance routines. The Songs were penned by the same songwriters, too... And James Bond fans will be interested to now that Albert 'cubby' Broccoli produced 'Chitty...' after 'Thunderball' (or was it 'You Only Live Twice'?) and utilized the submarine base set for baron Bomburst's hidden Dungeons where children are kept in dreadful conditions. But more due must go to Roald Dahl's quirky, somewhat perverse imagination when it comes to the 'darker side' of the movie , than to Ian Fleming, as another 'commenter' claims. The film is long, but has many highlights and very few pitfalls. So HOORRAY for courageous Producers,Directors, Art Directors, Actors and Scriptwriters. To Musicians and Directors of Photography... in short to ALL who have the VISION to leave us with real pearls which stand the test of time! Viva Chitty Chitty Bang Bang!",Chitty Chitty Bang Bang
93,bobkuhl,"Really, the Perfect Family Movie",9,28 November 2019,"Im in my fifties, and this is still my all time favorite movie. Why? Because it's just the perfect movie in terms of the mix of fun & drama, song, dance and acting, a great story, wonderful actors, great direction and superb cinematography (PLEASE WATCH THE WIDESCREEN VERSION IF YOU CAN).
In my mind, the top of Dick Van Dyke's legacy.
Bonus points for viewers who recognize some of the minor actors who were actually famous British comedians beyond Benny Hill.",Chitty Chitty Bang Bang
94,Lori S,"Beautiful scenery, fun movie",9,11 December 1998,"This movie is good fun.  Looks like it was filmed in Devon or Dorset, England, and of course at the famous Neuschweitzen(sp?) Castle in Germany - gorgeous scenery.  Some songs are better than others.  Thumbs up to ""Hushabye Mountain"" (which sounds similar to Mary Poppins' ""Feed the Birds""), ""Toot Sweets"" & ""Truly Scrumptious"".  Dick van Dyke's ""The Old Bamboo"" sounds too close to Mary Poppins' ""Step in Time"".  Of course both movies had their songs written & composed by the Sherman Brothers.  Quite interesting to see the usually nasty Bond villain Gert Frobe play a very dimwitted villain here, or the dirty-minded Benny Hill play the nerdy Toymaker.  Sally Ann Howes looks & sounds lovely, yet she did very few movies.  The 2 kids, while cute & pretty good actors, have a tendency to screech & sound like mice when they yell for help.

The general annoyance factor is very high for this movie. The songs aren't bad, especially the ""posh, posh traveling life,"" and there are several little jokes, like ""X, as in X and bacon."" But the songs, although memorable, aren't songs I necessarily want to remember, and the kids running around blowing whistle candies while stampeding dogs ruin a factory is just annoying. The king who outlaws children and continually tries to kill his wife is also annoying. I wish Benny Hill would just bop him on the head and be done with it.

98,Crystal_Hansen,"""Oh what a lovely lonely man""",10,26 February 2019,"Chitty Chitty Bang Bang is another one of those movies that is as timeless today as it was when it first came out in 1968. It's a movie that I've seen multiple times and still can't get enough. My first memory of the movie is when I was about ten years old I was watching the movie with my youngest siblings who were about 3 at the time. One of them turned to me, during the song in which the Baron and Baroness were trying to get rid of each other while singing about how they were the perfect pair using pet names for each other, and said, ""why did he open that door in the floor?"" I laughed and said nothing because I had no idea why he did it either. Sorry kid, I can't answer your question if I have the same question.Caractacus Potts is a wacky inventor who also happens to be the father of two young children. His inventions often get in the way of him being able to do the things that a good father can. After his children, Jeremy and Jemima, almost get hit by Truly Scrumptious in her motor car, she takes them home and yells at their inventor father for not having them in school and letting them run around in the streets where they could have been killed. Mr Potts yells at her for yelling at him and telling him how he is supposed to be raising his children. After a bit of yelling between them, Potts gets one of his Toot Sweets from his machine and complains about the holes that aren't supposed to be there. Truly tells him that the boiling point of his sugar is too high and he yells at her for that too. Truly leaves and the dog starts to chew on the candy making it whistle in the process. Mr Potts suddenly has the idea of making them whistling candies. He takes them to Mr Scrumptious who happens to own the largest candy factory in town and is Truly's father. That sure threw Mr Potts off. He wasn't expecting that. He'd just yelled at Truly for not knowing what she was talking about and just found out that, yes, she does know what she's talking about. That must've been a hard hit to the ego. His two children want this famous racing car that won a bunch of races and Mr Potts uses one of his inventions at a circus to earn enough money for the car. The invention is attached to a bicycle and is supposed to give fast hair cuts. A customer gets a haircut but Mr Potts starts laughing and pedals really fast, which ends up ruining the man's hair. He starts running from the guy and participates in one of the dancing acts, receiving a bunch of money from the performance. Then, he buys the car and brings it home to get fixed up. After the car is all fixed the trio goes out on a picnic and rund Truly off the road. Mr Potts carries her out of the pond where she ended up after getting run off the road. Truly joins them on the picnic and Mr Potts tells a story about a king that wants the magic car. The story takes up the remainder of the movie.As timeless today as when the film first hit the big screen, Chitty Chitty Bang Bang as a must see for any age. It's a perfect example of the way a child's imagination works. I don't know how someone could dislike this movie. I still enjoy it to this day and I remember watching it on an old VHS tape before my parents bought the dvd version.",Chitty Chitty Bang Bang
99,Neal99,A bloated marathon,2,6 February 2003,"I recently saw this film on video -- the first time I had seen it since my father took me to it on its initial release. I now realize what love it must have taken to sit through this stinker with me back then. This is one of the most inept, bloated films to have come out of that terrible period when Hollywood had no clue how to adapt to changing times. Dick Van Dyke is wonderful in his TV shows but not in this. Sally Ann Howes obviously was chosen because Julie Andrews wouldn't appear in this tripe. As others have said, the songs are atrocious. And it just goes on and on and on for what seems like days.",Chitty Chitty Bang Bang
100,alembic,Perfect example of it's type.,7,4 January 2002,Isn't it strange how movies critics hate are always loved by audiences ? I guess all of us who send in reviews to IMDB are actually critics but most reviews seen here from people who have seen it mention how they love this film - perhaps if for sentimental reasons. Maybe this is why Hollywood finds itself in troublesome times. Who is it that actually 'decides' what we want to see ? Ian Flemings imaginative story of a magical car is just that - magical. Perhaps the magic has left the minds of those who create volumes of B grade violent and uninspired offerings these days. Of course not all people will like this film but there are many who do. Maybe it is a bit long - but many films were during this era before such emphasis was placed on the 90 minute audience rotation factor. The longer format allows much more freedom to the director. How many films made today will still be remembered or commented on 30-40 years after their release ? This film was shot for a darkened theatre and a big screen for maximum viewing pleasure so it suffers from a small screen view. This film is as fresh today as at it's first screening. Enjoy.,Chitty Chitty Bang Bang
101,alembic,"Now available as ""special edition"" DVD ... go get it.",7,5 June 2004,"Well it's been 2 years since I last posted a review for this movie... I have just purchased the ""Special Edition"" version mainly because at last there is a wide-screen DVD version now available! This was one movie that suffered very greatly from a standard T.V format transfer ..... Now in wide-screen,it is possible to see the cinematography as it was intended to be viewed from the original Super Panavision format,even though there is still some ""enhanced"" format alteration to bring it into line with 16:9 ratio and luckily it was shot in Technicolor,which was easily the best analogue colour system around. Perspectives can now be seen as intended and the beautiful sets and the dance routines look vastly better... you can actually see all the dancers ! Take for instance one scene in Caractacus Potts windmill laboratory,where he shows Truly Scrumptious one of his inventions with which he intends to transmit ""pictures and sound"".....in the standard format half of the shot is missing so the machine cannot be fully seen and it makes no sense.. however in wide-screen you can see the ""picture"" and also the whole machine; so now you can enjoy one of Emmet Rolands fantasy machine creations in full. All through the movie the scenery and sets are set up framed with objects in the foreground and back ground which lend to perspective and depth of the image. The sound track seems also to have been worked on .. in previous releases the children's voices seemed to ""squeak"" but now they sound much more natural. You can see how much we have been missing with previous releases and it is a lot. The Special Edition also has some featurettes on the making of the movie and other related information plus a lovely booklet as well.As to the movie itself .... it has never lost it's magic for me. I see reviews which pan the musical numbers or say it's too long or thatafter seeing it as an adult they were disappointed from what they remember as a child ... but is that not the point ? It is a movie for children and/or those adults who can still view it remembering the child in themselves. It has no coarse language , no mindless violence (except the pantomime variety).. no cynicism ...just fun. In short it is a type of movie that Hollywood can no longer make because they no longer know how ... so it should be treasured more for it. People criticize Dick Van Dykes ""American"" accent but I find it not intrusive at all ... in fact he would probably have been better off using his normal voice in ""Mary Poppins"" than attempting the cockney accent which he obviously had some difficulty with.Kids love this movie .. let them be the judges.Thank-you Cubby Broccoli ..we miss you. Thank-you Ian Fleming / Roald Dahl / Richard Maibaum and Ken Hughes. Thank-you Ken Adam ... a genius in design for Chitty.",Chitty Chitty Bang Bang

There are a couple exceptions and this MOVIE is my #1 on that short list.My hero in this movie is Dick Van Dyke... The guy sings and dances ""AT THE SAME TIME"" without clever editing that is carefully diced and scrutinized used today to hide sub-par performances by 'Less Talented'.So if you like ""REAL TALENT"" across acting, music, and dancing... you must give this thing one viewing. I also love the fact that this movie has a intermission... LOVED IT...This movie was a staple for my children growing up and being that i didn't see this movie until the age of 26 or 27 it reshaped my thoughts around this genre. I'm 39 now and have seen it at least 4 to 6 times with my kids.It has everything in it... comedy, action, ""The Child Catcher"" ...The other performers were also amazing in the show and no slight to them, but i can watch Dick Van Dyke take on the ""Old Bamboo"" and still be amazed by the singing, dancing and amazing performances.Dick Van Dyke is just one of those guys I can't imagine really getting old... i mean sure he will age... but i could never imagine him mentally slowing down... or losing his charisma regardless of age.",Chitty Chitty Bang Bang

The main story - the car, the attempt to kidnap the inventor, and the rescue is actually quite good, but it is almost entirely ruined by a series of songs that add nothing to the story and are not even much good as songs.  In particularly the long sequences where Dick van Dyke attempts to raise enough money to purchase the carcass of the car were dreadful - long, slow, boring ""spectacles"" that felt entirely out of place.Get it on video or DVD and skip the musical sequences.",Chitty Chitty Bang Bang
107,DB-55,Wonderful if a little uneven.,7,3 October 1999,"Another movie which suffers when viewed on a small screen since many of the shots were set up for the cinema big screen. The films content attempts to entertain both adults and children alike ( made at a time when parents actually took their children to see movies ). This results in some of the films content being beyond children's understanding and sometimes too childish for adults. What the film demands is that you can let the child within you re-surface and for you to let the fantasy envelop you.If you cannot do this then the movie will not work for you. If you can then sit back and enjoy a fun ride with flying cars and baddie Barons, often beautiful cinematography and great dance routines. A little uneven perhaps ( particularly two thirds of the way through ). Often criticized for being too long but it was originally intended to be seen in two parts (an intermission came as the car sailed over the cliff ) which gave the audience a breather ( and time to get goodies like ice-cream).

112,moonrazer-487-184393,A Turn of the Century Bond for the Whole Family,10,2 September 2013,"I can't remember when I first saw this movie, but I caught it recently on Netflix. As most of you may know, this was an adaptation of an Ian Fleming novel produced by Cubby Broccoli, and with parts filmed at Pinewood Studios in England, if it all sounds a little familiar this the same people that have done the early Bond movies. Desmond Llewelyn (The original and best Q from the Bond films) makes an appearance as 1920's version of his Q character. Like most Broccoli films this is a pure fantasy done for a child's eye. There are lots of musical numbers, my favorite being the ""Roses of Success"" number. That's one we can all take with us. I don't think anyone has delved very deeply into the character of Chitty herself. A great racer, her racing days are cut short when she is forced to take a fatal dive off the track to avoid striking a child and her dog, thus not only losing the race but relegating herself to scrap heap where she is befriend by two children. When Mr Coggins agrees to sell her to a junk man to be melted down, the children come to her rescue. Once rescued, Chitty is brought back to life by their inventor father. They hit the road with Chitty and she becomes fiercely loyal and displays super powers to get the family and lovely Truly Scrumptious out of danger. I can appreciate this now more than I could as a child. This movie reminds me a lot of the Herbie the Love Bug movies which were coming out about the same time. Chitty is much more visually spectacular than the Herbie movies, and her part is much more low key with no actual interaction with the other characters. If you've ever fixed up an old vehicle or rescue one from going to a scrap yard, you can understand the bond that appears to develop between the owners and the vehicle. Anyway enough of my rambling. It runs a little long in spots, if this were in a theater today,I doubt most kids could sit through with out being medicated but then again maybe not.",Chitty Chitty Bang Bang

Not to overuse the expression, but they don't make 'em like this anymore!

116,imdb-2078,How did the actors get through this?,4,4 January 2004,"Add me to the list of people who saw this as a kid, loved it, rented it for my own kid to watch, and was disappointed. It hasn't aged well.There are great performances in Chitty Chitty Bang Bang, but the musical numbers are so dreadful that you have to feel for Van Dyke and Howes. How did she ever get through ""Lonely Man""? And the bamboo song--what in the world was that supposed to be? ""Posh"" would be good if it wasn't so shamelessly contrived to sound like ""A Little Bit of Luck"" from ""My Fair Lady"". Jefferies does a fine job, but the material--ugh. It's a wonder they didn't put him in a top hat and shabby tails to complete the rip-off.Howes in particular deserves credit for a great effort on her numbers; it must have been quite a challenge to learn and perform material so lacking in focus and so utterly unmoving. I dare anyone to do a good job with ""Lonely Man""--it's an awful song.The one unqualified success is Robert Helpmann as the Child Catcher. My son--a jaded product of modern media excess--was as scared as I'd been all those years ago. We had to show him IMDb's photo of Helpmann in street dress to get him to sleep that night.But, sadly, as another has commented: Chitty Chitty Bang Bang provides a great view of Hollywood hopelessly lost from generational confusion.Sorry to slam the happy memories, but this mostly stinks.

It never fails to amaze me at the breadth of situations.  It is truly epic.I've always loved the movie, and with kids of my own, just bought it.The story is great and there's a lot to it, but there is a character that hates little kids (and can 'sniff' them out with his huge proboscis).  He is scary.  You should be with your kids during the last 1/3 of the film when he is around.  However, the entire film is a delightful flight of fantasy, starting with no particular goal and then drawing the (child) viewer in by becoming more and more engrossing.Can you imagine the people who made the bond films making a child's film? They did it, and 'Chitty Chitty Bang Bang' is it.  Ian Fleming wrote, Albert Broccoli produced, but wait, Roald Dahl also wrote!!!  It's a kid's film of gigantic proportions.  (They squeezed this in between 'You only live twice' and 'her majesty's secret service')It needs to be seen to be appreciated.Caveat - if you hate musicals like I do, there is a bunch of singing.

My favorite part is when Caracus Potts and Truly Scrumptious pretend to be toys for the Baron and do a nice song and dance. The tune is just great!

To me the movie will forever be a part of my childhood that I will remember fondly. The child catcher kinda scared me, but I truly love all the songs. I'm sometimes catching myself humming one of the songs. Personally this movie to me surpasses MARY POPPINS. As a child growing up in the 70's and 80's there are just those movies that you can never get tired of watching.

I remember viewing this film as a child and reading (and being much surprised that the author was none other than ""oo7"" himself, Ian Fleming!). The expansion of Mr. Fleming's novel is simply Scrumptious. Dick Van Dykes' portrayal of the eccentric inventor is just wonderful. Ilove it when he dances with the troupe at the carnival, stealing the show along with the fantastic dancers/singers who accompany him. The lullaby he sings to the children is one of my all-time favorite songs...it is so poignant and brilliantly written. Susan Ann Howes' role as Truly Scrumptious was delightful and when she is a music box ballerina she just melts my heart....There is so much I could say about ""Chitty Chitty Bang Bang"" but my recommendation is just to sit back with a bag of Spicy Nacho popcorn (My personal favorite) and enjoy!",Chitty Chitty Bang Bang
122,metroidphazon4,too cheesy!,4,14 November 2010,this movie is half and half. half good half bad. in other words 50-50. the movie is about a magical car that can fly and stuff! the main problem is just that its too happy go lucky for my liking. some people may like it but for more hardcore movie fans will most likely chose a better film.a much better pick is the cat from outer space now thats one heck of a classic! sorry but for me this movie is just not worth my time.there are always better car movies like cars or that one about the little beetle car.there are lots of good car movies this not one of them.i sure hope they never remake this movie! bottom line: just to cheesy and happy really not a generally good movie.,Chitty Chitty Bang Bang
123,Alan D,Am Outstanding Piece of Entertainment!,10,28 December 1999,"I just received a copy of this on DVD as a Christmas present and have had hours of fun re-acquainting myself with this wonderful film. I saw it in the cinema when it was first released and I am delighted to say that it hasn't dated a bit (except for some of the blue screen effects but what the hell).I think it is one of the best children's movies ever made, because like in all successful areas of entertainment for young people, it treats the subject matter with respect and seriousness.  Couple this with the 007 production team and you are on to a winner.If you haven't seen this on DVD yet, I strongly recommend that you do.Enjoy.",Chitty Chitty Bang Bang
124,rlane1000,Wonderful Family Movie. Simply a Classic.,10,6 July 2017,One of the great Dick Van Dyke's best performances. Fantastic sets. Wonderful cinematography. Musical component complements and does not overwhelm the production. You can be comfortable watching with the entire family.

Who thought it would be a goodidea for Van Dyke to reprise his 'nearly but not quite entirely unlikeCockney' accent? The songs are rubbish, the direction clumsy, and greatperformers like Robert Helpmann are embarrassed. If you were sorry thatthe British film industry ran out of money, watch this again and beglad. No other country, surely, could produce something this twee andsquirm-inducing.Why oh why do they put it on TV every other year? Are kids this easilypleased? God",Chitty Chitty Bang Bang
127,Xyzzy,Long. Dense. Cloying. Dated. Uneven. Underrated. Wonderful.,8,12 August 1999,"This movie suffers from a number of things, not the least of which is comparison to the ""practically perfect Mary Poppins"", which this movie hearkens back to--particularly with the songs ""Hushabye Mountain"" and ""The Old Bamboo"", not to mention the whole turn-of-the-century England millieu.And, boy, is it dense. Two-and-a-half-hours (more or less, depending on the cut, I believe) of singing and dancing and musical overtures, without a lot of dead-time between numbers.At the same time, it's somewhat unfocussed with regard to its audience. The humor will be too broad for some older children, while some of the songs will bore younger children.  (Sally Anne Howe gives a beautiful performance of ""Lovely, Lonely Man"" but the song itself seems somewhat out of place.)And then there's the camerawork. Exacerbated by pan-and-scan format (and MGM has apparently opted not to release the widescreen version, even on DVD), the movie features pans and cuts that were stylish in the '60s but look a little silly now.The story itself sprawls, with the middle portion of the movie being taken up by a story-within-the-story which is somewhat confusing when we exit it wondering how much of what we just saw is supposed to carry over into the outer story.But ultimately, these flaws seem minor. The movie is charming, well-done and so good-natured, it's hard not to like. The Sherman Brothers were at their peak, not to mention Dick Van Dyke. He and Ms. Howe seem to have a genuine chemistry. When the movie shines, it really shines, enough to make you forget the tarnish on the other parts.",Chitty Chitty Bang Bang

Unfortunately, this is becoming increasingly rare in today's world.  It does a magnificent job of capturing your attention, unless of course, you're not willing to let your guard down and become child-like for a couple of hours.If you're looking for a safe, imaginative, captivating film for your kids (that you can also enjoy), then check this one out - it's a good one.

I also owned the soundtrack album and remember my cousin had a stuffed Dick Van Dyke ""Mr.Potts"" pull-string talking plush toy as well.This film can be alternately described as JAMES BOND MEETS MARY POPPINS, as it takes it's strengths from both of those Hollywood franchises, creating something unique and in many ways better (certainly than Disney live-action fodder of the era, a' la THE GNOMEMOBILE, another Mary Poppins wannabee).Dick van Dyke should have gotten an award for his performance in this film--hands down. He is at the peak of his considerable talents here. The musical number ME OL' BAMBOO is one of the most spectacularly choreographed and executed routines I've ever seen in any musical. Most people outside the immediate CHITTY CHITTY fan base , have never even heard of it! If there are any shortcomings, (outside of the surprisingly poor blue-screen special effects) it might be the casting of Sally Ann Howes, for me.I was just never razy about the Truly Scruptious persona she delivers. But she is certainly a credible actress and does have moments where she shines.The Grandfather (Lionel Jefferies) is a hoot! and all his scenes are amusing and fun,particularly the musical number POSH, probably the second or third best scene from the score. The songs are MOSTLY good, but I wouldn't consider them TRULY scrumptious.This film IS excellent entertainment for children and still holds up well decades later for ""kids"" like myself who have since (assumingly) ""grown up"". Unless you're a cynical smart-ass who would rather look at something like SAW II or FACES OF DEATH III,perhaps even you can find something to enjoy here.By the way,you MUST see this film in WIDESCREEN, or else you are getting just the CHITTY CHITTY and missing all the BANG BANG!",Chitty Chitty Bang Bang
130,Queer_As_Brian_Kinney,"Chitty Chitty Bang Bang, we love you too!",10,18 June 2010,"I have to say, this was one of my favorite movies when I was little (even though it wasn't as popular in the '90s when I was born), and it still is. So right now, I'm sitting here watching the movie I loved as a child and probably always will while I write this. I was very gullible as a child. For the longest time I even thought that Chitty Chitty Bang Bang really could fly, just as I thought that Kansas was colored black and white and as I thought Dorothy really did go to Oz (from ""The Wizard of Oz""). Honestly, I think I enjoyed this movie just a tad bit more when I actually thought the car could fly, because it made the movie that much more special. But it's still the same good 'ol movie I love. Although ""Chitty Chitty Bang Bang"" is a happy-go-lucky movie with singing and fatherly love in it, the Child Catcher scared the crap out of me and probably still would (I guess I'll just have to watch the rest of the movie)! Because of this movie I didn't need ""stranger Danger"" lessons; I learned not to talk to strangers from watching the evil Child Catcher in action. So you could say this movie taught me a lot. And it did. So that being said, Chitty Chitty Bang Bang, we love you too!!!!!",Chitty Chitty Bang Bang

The lead actors are quite good and entertaining, and the child catcher is very creepy. Plus, it has a cool car and the first half is a good story. But the second half, not so much. The story just goes too far. There is A LOT of plot lines, and so many random scenes that it's just a waste of time. Also, the songs are dumb, the kids are annoying, and many scenes either don't make sense or are just flat out stupid.
I will say that some LITTE kids might enjoy it, but I wouldn't count this as a classic film by any means.SPOILER ALERT
The dumbest part of the entire film is that it turns out that the whole second half was a story that the father told his kids.",Chitty Chitty Bang Bang

I would recommend this movie to anybody.,Chitty Chitty Bang Bang
133,dmne,Over long?,10,16 June 2006,"I have noticed several comments concerning this movie that condemn it for being ""over long"". It's very interesting to me that just about any film that dares extend past the two hour mark is thought to be too long. Yet, Americans can watch a three, four, or sometimes even five hour sporting event and think nothing of it. It's nothing to sit in front of the TV or the computer for hours on end. Even stage productions that run close to three hours are not considered too long. Our attention span is just fine for lots of other things, why are movies so different? Anyway, now that I've gotten down from my soap box, on to the movie. ""Chitty"" is a wonderful film for young and old alike. The cast is right on. The songs are very tuneful and memorable, especially the title tune. The film keeps a good pace and stays interesting. Personally, I can watch the whole thing from beginning to end without it losing my attention. (Oops! Back on that soap box again! Get down from there!) About the only minor regret that I have is not seeing Julie Andrews cast as Truly. She would have been Scrumptious. Not to disparage Sally Ann Howes, who was wonderful.All in all, a wonderful film that everyone should see at least once.",Chitty Chitty Bang Bang

Dick Van Dyke was awesome in his role, as he always is, and the other actors were great as well. It always reminds me of Mary Poppins in a way, especially the ""Me Old Bamboo"" part. Considering Dick Van Dyke isn't a dancer, he sure looks like one in this film. If this movie didn't win an award, it should have. It's awesome! The car is one of my favorite things, and my favorite singing-dancing part is the doll part. Sally Ann Howes is awesome in this movie! She has an amazing voice. The children were also good.

When I went to Germany, I visited Neuschwanstein castle, not because of Ludwig II or Richard Wagner--but because of this movie! It's perfectly cast, with brilliant, astounding music, and a design that knocks your socks off. There's only one moment where the magic languishes: when the picnic at the beach is almost over.It's one of those films that, frame by frame, only get better with each subsequent viewing--because it's so rich and deep. Dick Van Dyke was never better. Sally Ann Howe is perfect. Gert Frobe, Sir Robert Helpmann and Anna Quayle are by turns menacing and hilarious, the script by legendary Roald Dahl is mesmerizing and the art direction is breathtaking.However, this film about the love of a magical automobile may appeal more to boys than girls. No wonder they've made a stage musical of this. The only mystery is why it took them so long!",Chitty Chitty Bang Bang
138,robertharveylaw,There is little to recommend this movie.,2,28 November 2013,"This movie is pretty terrible.At least Dick Van Dyke has moved past the world's worst British accent that he displayed in ""Mary Poppins"" to not trying at all. It's quite possible that he was sober during the shooting of this movie.At just under two and a half hours, this movie is too long by at least an hour. How long do you think a child wants to watch this unfortunate effort?The first half is mostly tolerable, but the second half reeks of desperation and padding. Scenes that could have been 30 seconds long are five or six minutes. The best thing in the movie is Sally Ann Howes, who manages to project an innocent sincerity that Van Dyke is not capable of.Plus I hate the songs.",Chitty Chitty Bang Bang

Unless of course threes a Elvis Presley involved (Thou shalt have no King but Elvis, and RCA is his prophet). But there's no King in this piece of chitty. I just have to scream it out. Breaking my own rule, this is a serious stinker. 144 minutes? Must be some kind of specially MADE minutes, the only special effect worth a donkeys droppings in the whole movie, it feels like 144 hours. And its all done with the horrible musical numbers, the rest of the movie can be tolerated, some cute kids, a pretty woman, a man to win the woman's heart blah blah make a new mother to his children, seen it before, will see it again (hey, its a Oscar plot after all) but why do they sing all this horrible songs? And why must these horrible songs be sooo loooong? And sooo boooring? I've seen a thing called Chitty Chitty Bang Bang, where the Ch's was Sh's. Not good. Not good at all. But... I don't know.

141,kitagrl28,Cute movie but....,7,3 December 2007,"When I was young I absolutely LOVED Ian Fleming's original Chitty Chitty Bang Bang book! It was so full of suspense and action. I know I must have watched the movie as a child and I remember having a soundtrack of the movie as well (in the form of a record) but the movie must have bored me (unlike Wizard of Oz which was a favorite of mine back then). Now watching it with my kids I am sorely distressed that they steal the name of my beloved book and put it on this movie. I much prefer the loving Potts family of the book and the exciting adventures they go through..and the successful whistling sweets (rather than the movie's version of them turning into doggy candy).However I'll give it 7 stars only because my kids like it and its a fairly good film. The songs are cute although I agree with others that the ""Lovely Lonely Man"" song is awfully long and kind of stupid actually for this movie. Also the first few times my kids watched it, the child catcher and the two ""bad guys"" near the beginning of the story kind of freaked them out and we had to stop it several times and try again when they got a bit older.I love Dick Van Dyke and he has a few good scenes in this movie but I much prefer him with Julie Andrews in Mary Poppins.

After reading some of the user comments, I naturally felt prompted to reply to some of them.This is a fantasy and NOT a comedy. There are many things to laugh or smile at including all the mildly slapstick moments. All the while, the dialog is delivered more or less straight. While on the subject of dialog, I turned on subtitles to find out what the Prime Minister was saying. His lines are bit goofy but mildly funny.If you don't like musicals, perhaps you shouldn't watch this movie. Let your kids watch it! My family loves musicals and we lament the fact that there are not many produced any more. Please note that the music for this movie was scored by Sherman and Sherman, who also scored Mary Poppins.If you think 144 minutes is too long for a movie, please note that there's an intermission in the middle. You also have the pause or stop button at your command. The movie only drags for me when Sally Ann Howes sings ""Lonely Man"". It's a wonderful song, but it doesn't seem to belong in the movie. If you take notice of where they put this scene, it especially seems not to belong. On the bright side, it does highlight Ms. Howes' wonderful voice.It's a wonderful movie. Grab the movie and enough popcorn for the duration and see it with your loved ones. Parents of young children may want to watch the child catcher scene prior to letting their kids watch it. Although Robert Helpmann's treatment of the child catcher is mild compared to the Wicked Witch of the West from the Wizard of Oz, some users commented that as children, he frightened them.",Chitty Chitty Bang Bang
146,ghost21-1,A truly superb movie!,10,3 April 2006,"I saw Chitty Chitty Bang Bang at the local drive-in when I was about 9. Since then it has been one of my all-time favourite movies. We bought a copy for our son 5 years ago, and he still watches it. In particular, I offer the following observations: 1. Great story, with a terrific balance of fantasy, colour, fun, humour, and the good guys winning! Also great balance of drama - who can forget the scene where Chitty charges over the cliff, and then we have intermission! We had to wait 20 minutes to see Chitty spread her wings! 2. Lots of colour, light, and sunshine. It's a very happy, optimistic movie, with a positive view of children and human nature in general. Far too many children's' movies these days are very dark, or try to give us philosophy lessons. There's none of that in CCBB - just a focus on a good story with a happy outcome. And some great footage of the delightful English countryside.3. Great casting! From Dick van Dyke as the inventor, Lionel Jeffries as the eccentric dad; to the Baron and his wife; great cameo roles from Sir Robert Helpmann as the child-catcher; Benny Hill as the Toymaker, and the two blundering dolts who were the Baron's spies. Oh, and Sally-Anne Howe was superb as Truly Scrumptious (far superior to anything Julie Andrews could have done) 4. Great positive, energetic and uplifting music! Often the music can make or break a movie. In CCBB, the music fits the moods of each scene perfectly, whether its comedy, fantasy, romance, or driving Chitty! A few entries mention Mary Poppins. One entry describes CCBB as a ""thinly disguised clone of the hugely successful Mary Poppins."" I cannot agree with this. CCBB is very different, and, in my opinion, far superior to Mary Poppins.",Chitty Chitty Bang Bang

149,Trini_Triggs,"Good Movie, Scary Nazis",7,5 March 2003,"I first saw this movie as a kid, and I remember being utterly scared by the Child Catcher in Vulgaria. I think it was his nose (plus the fact that Marilyn Manson used a quote from the movie as an album title). I thought the Nazi themes were very interesting, and it gives you some insight on how it might have felt to be a ""undesirable"" child in Nazi Germany. I always identified with the kids and felt that if the Child Catcher got to the kids, he'd get me right along with them. The rest of the movie is good, and the visual effects are pretty good with large sets and great location shots. There's not much to complain about, except maybe wishing for a little more story and less dancing and singing in the pre-Vulgaria story. Also, the lullaby is a great song. I thought the car was awesome, and for a movie made almost 40 years ago, the noises the car makes remind me of some kind of electronic rap beats. There's a few cheap SFX shots of the car doing zany things, but as a whole the movie looks great.

Sadly, this movie is often overlooked. As a college student, few of my friends know about this film. The few that do know of it treasure it. Every child should be so lucky as to be raised with Chitty. The dancing, the songs, the genius and humor showcase the best of musicals and childhood alike. Enjoy and share this unsung classic.

True, it's not for the cynical or for those who want realism. For those, however, who seek adventure, comedy, great songs and most of all fun this classic 60's musical delivers it all in great style. A truly fun family film, although very small children may not be able to sit still through the entire movie (even with the Intermission). CCBB will always be at the top of my favourite movie list.

My mum had read the original Ian Fleming book to me and it is a great story: a racing car, adventure, magic, gangsters, explosions, an underground arms cache; everything a young lad could want. The film was made in a village near my house, I saw them film bits of it.So why did the film makers ruin it so completely? The two children, their father and the car are the only things that the book and the film have in common; the story lines are completely different.Where does one start about the film? A woefully weak story, silly slapstick comedy, Dick van Dyke, the list goes on. I guess if they hadn't called it Chitty Chitty Bang Bang it would be simply a very bad film but pretending that is has anything to do with the fine book is criminal.Try reading the book to your kids; mine loved it!",Chitty Chitty Bang Bang

When Professor Potts wheels out the newly restored and improved CCBB out of the garage, a little tear welled up in my eye.As others have mentioned here, Dick Van Dyke's lack of attempt at an accent is a bit puzzling. Especially when you consider that he tried an accent, with moderate success, four years earlier in Mary Poppins. However, this movie is a fantasy and silly little details like that do not diminish it. Dick Van Dyke is of course excellent. The rest of the cast are also very good.While the movie is long compared to today's children's movies which rarely seem to last longer than an hour and fifteen minutes; I thought it didn't drag.

Great characters and enjoyable music combine to make this a great film for a rainy day!,Chitty Chitty Bang Bang
159,giblin,This is a timeless classic that out-Disneys Disney.,10,27 August 2006,"Plain and simply, this is one of the best family films ever made. The fact that someone other than Disney made the film seems to have blinded some pundits (e.g., Disney scholar and film critic Leonard Maltin) to its many and varied charms. For ""Chitty,"" in fact, originated in the book by James Bond creator Ian Fleming and, horror of horrors, was produced outside Hollywood by Albert Broccoli, the man behind the successful Bond film series. Yet, a closer look at the credits reveals the presence of the same musical composers, the much-heralded Sherman Brothers and Irwin Kostal, who could do no wrong when they wrote for Disney, but somehow left their talent behind when they signed on with Mr. Broccoli. (Note Maltin's comment in his 2007 film guide that the film's score is ""forgettable."") The same apparently happened with the choreographers Dee Dee Wood and Marc Breaux, who are universally acclaimed for their work on ""Mary Poppins,"" but ignored, at least by Maltin, for the snappy and often elaborate routines in ""Chitty."" In fact, the songs, background music and dances here are as good or better than anything in Disney and often actually advance the plot, rather than grinding it to a halt in the more customary way. A case in point is Caractacus' ""Old Bamboo"" song and dance routine, which provides not only an instantly memorable tune (and dance), but also the financial means to save Chitty from the scrap heap. The cast itself is nothing short of superb, with American comic actor Dick Van Dyke wisely eschewing any attempt at an English accent, something many of us wish he had done a few years earlier in ""Poppins."" (In a 1998 appearance on the Rosie O'Donnell show, the self-effacing Mr. Van Dyke acknowledged his limitation in the area of English accents.) The actors playing the children are a genuine delight, charming and sincere without being cloying, while the supporting cast is filled with more marvelous British character actors than one can count, not the least of them being Lionel Jeffries (actually six months younger than Van Dyke, whose father he was playing) and comedy legend Benny Hill in a rare straight role. And if that's not enough, there's always the scene in which Goldfinger himself (German actor Gert Frobe) sings and dances! Then there is the simply stunning cinematography by Christopher Challis, the marvelous costumes by Joan Bridge and Elizabeth Haffenden, and the fantastic production design by Oscar-winning designer Ken Adam, whose high ceilings and sloping walls are instantly identifiable from such classics as ""Goldfinger"" and ""Dr. Strangelove."" And unlike ""Poppins,"" which is inexplicably praised for its obvious studio recreations of London streets, this film actually goes on location--and then some, showcasing truly magnificent settings in southern England, France and Germany (including the fabulous, fairy-tale Neuschwanstein Castle). Maltin and others have complained about the film's special effects, calling them ""the shoddiest ever."" What they are talking about is the blue screen traveling matte shots in which the magical car was optically placed in front of separately-shot film of a sky background. And I agree that several of these shots are ""obvious"" to film students who know how they are achieved. But, again, look at what is overlooked. The car itself, which undergoes several conversions for air and sea travel, is an amazing mechanical special effect designed and built by John Stears. Stears, of course, won an Oscar for the SFX on ""Thunderball"" and would go on to win another for a little film called ""Star Wars."" But never mind, what could he know about special effects? Oh, did I mention that the screenplay was co-written by Roal Dahl, someone who just might have known a thing or two about children's stories. But enough. This film is truly scrumptious from the first frame to the last, a timeless delight for anyone but Hollywood film critics.",Chitty Chitty Bang Bang
160,lewarne,those were the days,10,24 January 2001,"Escapism at its finest! As a kid it was great, as an adult it is better. The idea of crazy inventions from cars to machines that make you breakfast, cut your hair and make musical sweets, no responsibilities, living in a run down windmill, playing with rockets and explosives, one bad guy who is not really a challenge at all, a beautiful woman - it has everything you need to escape to a dreamy land...This film has always inspired me : for some reason when I left school I studied mechanical engineering .... it makes sense to me now.",Chitty Chitty Bang Bang
161,rparnellrp,A must see film no matter what your age,10,18 April 2020,"I felt that I had to write a few words after reading a so called professional critic from Time Out commenting that this had shoddy effects and forgettable songs. I can only imagine that this individual must've had something important on their mind at the time, because everybody that I know remembers at least one song from this film. Personally, I'll happily watch & sing/hum along to every song in the film, even 40 years after first seeing it. And, if you want brilliant special effects, then maybe go for something that isn't 50 years old!!",Chitty Chitty Bang Bang
162,resalmon,I still watch it to this day....,10,18 August 2006,"First of all - if Ian Fleming - master of James Bond was going to write a children's' book, then you can bet your last dollar it's gonna be a good one. Chitty is just that. It's a wonderful movie. Sally Ann Howe has a voice that Julie Andrews would have been LUCKY to have! Who can argue with that? No one with decent hearing that's for sure. Dick Van Dyke also did a fantastic job of dancing like the goofball he is! HA! This move still makes me laugh and it is absolutely one of the movies that I will introduce to my son and hope he will enjoy it his entire life as I have.Now...if I could only get behind the wheel of Chitty Chitty Bang Bang just once!",Chitty Chitty Bang Bang

165,sapphireflood8,A dad and his 2 kids go on a magical adventure with their new friend Truly.,9,21 June 2015,"I don't know why the IMDb rating is so low on this. In my opinion, this is one of THE best children's movies of all time. Even if you are an adult and have no children, you should definitely watch it. This movie is HILARIOUS, has some great musical numbers in it, a sweet story, and is just packed with fun. Great costume and set design as well. Not to mention, Dick van Dyke is in it! There is so much that happens in this movie, I don't know how they fit it all into less than 2 hours! If you like Mary Poppins (also an excellent film and a must-see) this movie is just as good. So DON'T be fooled by the rating. This movie rocks! I am 21 and still love Chitty Chitty Bang Bang!",Chitty Chitty Bang Bang
166,nick-shorthouse,Great children's film,9,25 December 2014,"Agree with a lot of the comments above. It is,indeed, an ionic children's film from the sixties, building on Mary Poppins, and almost as good. The storyline tails off a little bit but the scenery, songs and enthusiasm of everyone involved make it wonderful entertainment for little ones for two hours - not to mention adults too! Some of the songs are very memorable - like the title song, me ole bamboo (great dance scene at the funfair) and, of course, (Sally Anne Howe as) Truly Scrumptious, filmed on a summer's day near St. Tropez. I saw this when it first came out and have seen it several times since. My children used to love it. Anything with cars fascinates boys and the romantic link appeals to the girls. I know it's been panned by critics but it's good, clean fun. A really enjoyable family film.",Chitty Chitty Bang Bang
167,rosepup,the whole family loves it,9,13 May 2004,"I had mostly forgotten this movie after 30+ years, but my 2 year old received it as a gift, and is obsessed with it.  It's fantastic, really.  The locations are stunning, the musical numbers are (mostly) so lively, the physical humor is great! There is such a range of stuff in it, unlike current movies.  I even like it for its flaws.  It's really beautifully made.   The thing I didn't remember, and that disappointed me at first,  was that the whole story is a fantasy, a story within the story. I even like that the kids don't sing so well.  They seem more real, less like little prodigies.",Chitty Chitty Bang Bang
168,garethnutt,One of the best children's movies ever made,10,3 October 2004,"My two sons (now 4 and 2) have been obsessed with this movie for over a year now. They sing along to the songs and dance too - when old bamboo comes on, they pick up their sticks and hats and copy the routine. This is like an extended pantomime, with the scariest pantomime baddie in the history of movies. My brother couldn't sleep for a week after first seeing the childcatcher when he was 8. Anyway, this movie has everything - humour, pathos, great acting (and great casting), great songs and a great script (thank you Roald Dahl). I cannot fault this movie apart from the fact that it is a little long and the bit where they go off to vulgaria is a bit overextended. My family has now been to see the stage show twice too, and we are all firm ""bang bang"" nuts. If your kids have not seen this movie, then they haven't had a proper childhood!",Chitty Chitty Bang Bang
169,edwin-57,Perhaps the worst movie ever made,1,31 August 2014,"I read this book as a child in the 60s. While it was a story of fantasy, it did not talk down to the reader and was full of wit and subtlety. When the movie came out, I was very excited to see the wonderful tale of imagination come to the screen. What resulted was so insulting to my intelligence that it horrified me. Dick van Dyke's moronic mugging, the idiotic songs, the over the top portrayal of the title character, and general treacly smarm and cheese completely destroyed an amazing book. You think I'm being harsh? Read the book. Skip this movie. If it isn't the worst movie ever made, it is without a doubt the worst adaptation of a book ever perpetrated. It destroyed my faith in humanity and my opinion has not changed as this movie has not improved with age, whereas the book retains all its integrity and charm. Roald Dahl should have known better.",Chitty Chitty Bang Bang

The film is for any age and has laughs and serious elements. The songs are fantastic and you will just find yourself singing along to them without realising. The dances are excellent and all of the characters bring so much to the movie. would recommend this film to anybody. Grandpa Potts brings lots of laughter and many of the characters in the film you could relate to. The London theatre production of chitty chitty bang bang is also brilliant and makes you want to just sing along, there is extra songs in the theatre production and all of these fit in and are also brilliant as are the songs in the film",Chitty Chitty Bang Bang

The musical numbers were fun and entertaining, though NOT sophisticated Broadway musical numbers that the critics of this movie seem to think a movie must have for it to be a credible musical. I do think the movie was a bit too long, but had just the right amount of magical atmosphere to attract children's imaginations, even including a darker side, lending a bit of seriousness, with the child catcher, unlike children's movies today which movie producers today think children's movies MUST, ABSOLUTELY must be empty, vapid, nothingness, just Happy, Happy, Happy! We can't have any serious themes or plots for CHILDREN!, as the majority children's productions lack these days can we?

173,fredb58,A Childhood Memory -- Dashed!,3,21 August 2005,"I watched the video last night with my 3 and 6 year old girls. First time in perhaps 30 years I'd seen this movie, though many of the scenes and feelings came right back -- like the absolute terror of the ""Child Catcher""! What was I thinking letting my little ones watch (I covered their eyes on request)? Worse, as an adult I was blown away by this movie's unmitigated misogyny, best represented by the gratuitous efforts of the ""Baron"" to off his wife....the inappropriateness for kids (and I'm not a prude, mind you) of the ""Choochie Face"" number, with the Baroness in a teddy....that horrid ""Lonely Man"" number....and on and on.I'd say much more. The whole thing struck me as an attempt to outdo Disney and recapture some of the Van Dyke magic of Poppins. So I was interested to read on IMDb that Van Dyke was quoted as saying this would ""out-Disney Disney"" -- and that Julie Andrews was the original choice for Truly. Well they missed out on her -- and they misfired, big-time! I can't believe this was ever a ""mega-hit."" I seem to remember liking the book as a kid. Now I want to go back and read it again. Or maybe I shouldn't!",Chitty Chitty Bang Bang
